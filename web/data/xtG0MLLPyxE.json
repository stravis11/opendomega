Yes, sir. He waves. No questions\nThank you look for you by both consideration. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?\nThe chair here's none the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee?\nWhich was favorable to the adoption of the resolution the chair here's none the report of the committee is agreed to shall this\nresolution now be adopted. All those in favor of the adoption of the resolution will vote\naye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine.\nall members voted and all members voted. The clerk will lock the machines on the passage\nof Senate Resolution 84. The eyes are 156. The nays are A. This resolution having received\nThe requisite constitutional majority is therefore adopted.\nClerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 144.\nSenate Bill 144 by Senator Tipkins,\nthe 37th Cooch of the 51st cows of the 46th and others.\nWe entitled an act to amend part one of Article one of chapter three,\ntitle eight of the EFISCO to Georgia,\nannotated really in the general provisions for housing authorities.\nSo it's to limit the ability of city housing authorities to operate.\nto operate outside municipal boundaries without authorization.\nThis bill ever for the committee on governmental affairs,\nthat committee recommends that this bill do pass\nby committee, rules committee substitute.\nChair recognizes a representative air heart\nto present the bill.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nLadies and gentlemen, I bring for your consideration,\nSenate Bill 144.\nSenate Bill 144 changes the definition of the area\nof operation for a housing authority of a city.\nCurrently in code of city authorities,\nhousing authorities area of operation includes\nthe city limits of that municipality\nplus 10 miles beyond those city limits.\nWhat SB 144 does is remove that clause,\n10 miles beyond the city limits\nand requires housing authorities to get the approval\nof the governing body of the area\nin which they are looking to do the housing development\nthe housing project. I will note that any housing projects that are currently in operation\nwithin that 10-mile boundary outside the city limits can continue to operate. Essentially\nwhat we're saying is we want the areas outside those municipalities to have some say in\nthe development that goes on. Mostly this includes or involves the unincorporated portions\nof our county. We had a situation in Cobb County where the Marietta Housing Authority\nwent outside the city limits, built a development that was not compliant, was zoning, and did\nso without the consent of the county commission. So, anyway, this is just kind of cleaning\nthat up, making sure that there is some accountability here and that the communities that are affected\nby these developments at least have some say so in what is being developed\nthere. Mr. Speaker I'll yield for any questions.\nYou have some questions if you care to yield. I will. Chair recognizes Chairman Todd Jones\nin room 341 for a question. Does a lady yield? I do.\nJust for clarification, can the city remain in an unincorporated part of a county without\nthe county's approval?\nCan the city remain?\nOr can the housing authority remain?\nI apologize.\nCan the housing authority remain in the unincorporated part of a county without the county's approval?\nMy understanding is that the housing authority exists within the city.\nwas within the city's city limits, the housing authority can pretty much do what they want,\nalthough it is the city governing body can determine whether or not they want that\nhousing authority to abide by zoning or to abide by land use.\nSo it can continue to exist, but if they want to build outside of the perimeter, outside\nthe city limits, they would have to do so only with the approval of the governing body.\nDoes that answer your question?\nDo you further yield?\nYes.\nChair recognizes representative Eric Atomis to your left for a question.\nDoes the general allow you?\nYes.\nCan you define a housing project?\nWell, it would be a development under the administration of the housing authority.\nTypically they are built and constructed in areas where there is a need indicated.\nIn fact, if you look in SB 144, let me find, it says here, provided that a resolution\nshow had been adopted by the governing body are there such declaring that there is a need\nfor the city housing authority to exercise its powers within the territorial boundaries\nof said other city.\nSo there is typically sort of an assessment process that's gone through there, typically\nwith the housing authority to determine that there actually is a need that exists for\nthat development.\nThank you. Does a general lady further you? Yes. Have you ever visited a housing\nproject before? I have. Where? I've visited them in Cobb County. I've done in\nfact even as a as a young person in my youth group we used to do all sorts of\nprojects and visitations and housing projects near so yes I have had the\nopportunity to visit housing projects. Thank you. If there are no further questions\nMr. Speaker, I yield the well lady is yielded the well chair recognizes the\nHouse minority caucus whip representative Wilkerson to speak to the bill\nThank you, Mr. Speaker. I want to come to the well today in support of Senate Bill 144\nThis is about local control. We have had some issues in different areas where the housing authority did not believe\nThey need to comply with local zoning and so our county commissioners were\nNot able to to participate in the process so all this bill does is say that if a housing authority once it goes out of there\nThere are city boundaries. They have to get an annual government agreement with that local\nUnincorporated area. So it's a it's a very good bill and I'll be having to answer any questions\nI'm very familiar with the area because I know my district is next to\nRepresentative to Senator Tipton's district as well and and representative airheart and and it was\nKind of surprising to see a five-story building pop-up without any input at all from the community\nBut if there are any questions, I'll take them if not I'll yield a well. You have a question if you care to yield\nYes, I will take that chair recognizes representative cannon to your left for a question\nThank you. Hi there, mr. Web do you I do the question is it's been referenced local matters on this bill and so\nSo why are we debating this for the entire state of Georgia if we've only discussed it\nfor one county?\nThat's an excellent point.\nSo really it sparked from the one county because I don't think every housing authority is\ndoing this.\nIt was back in the 40s I want to say when these bills came around and back then the one\nmain city would be able to develop in the whole county and as time went on that one\ncity in this case thought that they should still be developing for the whole county.\nSo if they were to go into, say, Kennesaw, they would get an intergovernmental agreement.\nThe problem is that they're coming into other parts of the county without actually working\nwith those commissioners to do it.\nSo it would apply to the whole state because it is not just a local legislation, but it\nwould impact any city housing authority that wants to work in the county.\nThey would have to work with those commissioners to make sure that they were building what\nthey deemed the necessary housing.\nTo make sure that we do have the ability to have affordable housing spread throughout\nthe county and not just in one area and with that, Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the\nwell.\nIs there any objection to the previous question being ordered the chair\nhere's none the previous question is ordered? Is there any objection to\nadopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules the chair here's\nnone the rules committee substitute is adopted? Is there any objection to\nagreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of\nthe bill. The chair hears none. The report of the committee has agreed to\nshall this bill now pass. All those in favor of the passage of the bill will\nvote aye. Those opposed will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machines.\nIf all members voted, have all members voted, if so, the clerk will lock the machines on\nthe passage of Senate Bill 144.\nThe eyes are 145.\nThe nays are 23.\nThis bill, having received the requisite constitutional\nmajority, is therefore passed.\nClerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 95.\nSenate Bill 95 by Senator again to the 47th beech of the 21st Alvers of the 56th\nSenate of Barthay of the 31st and others. Meantado and act to amend\nTitle 50 that Fisher go to Georgia and Ted overlaid state government. So it's\nto provide conditions for meetings and public hearings to be held by\nteleconference and emergency conditions. This bill I refer to the committee on\ngovernment affairs that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee\nrules substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Allen Powell to present the\nBill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House. I bring to you\ntoday Senate Bill 95 and this is a bill that I had borrowed from my good friend\nSenator again to use as a writer for the co-am upgrade bill. Section one\ndeals with his original language which we didn't mean much because we've already\npassed it in a proper form by Chairman Lundston's bill. So at some point Section 1 will disappear\nthat was on the teleconferencing. But the meat of this gets into Section 2. And we have\ndowngraded it considerably, but we still left a lot of the criteria in there for controlling\nand to be sure that things are done right in the co-am industry. Section 2 deals with adding\nto additional individuals to the lottery board.\nThe governor will add a new person who will have experience\nin the co-am industry.\nAnd also the board chairman of the co-am advisory board\nwill be put on that board.\nNow that rotates off every year.\nSection three is creates a working rule\nthat non-cash redemptions that if it's\nlegal to purchase and is legal to redeem for.\nAnd it can't be exchanged for any cash or currency or anything like that.\nIt also establishes the gift cards.\nSection 3 further says it puts a $50 cap on the class A machines on the gifts that are\nin those or the prizes in those.\nSection 4, it was that specific information that retail owners get licensed that they'll\nhave to provide to be sure they're on the straight up and up.\nAnd also for the masters, they also have to provide certain other basic information\nand certain financial information to ensure they're in compliance with the existing law.\nThe COM section will also does one thing, it's of major importance, it puts a COM division\nof the Georgia Lottery, they'll be subject to the Georgia Administrative Procedures Act.\nSection 5, as it creates a 50-50 reel, this in effect, that will be done on a quarterly\nbasis instead of a monthly basis and also does a carve out for the charitable organizations\nfrom the 5050 rule that they've got to have been a 501c3 for at least 10 years and this\nwould be a charitable group such as the American Legion, VFW, or some of those type organizations.\nAnd then last but not least, the master license holders.\nAs I told you, I went about this bill before, one of the things that we've been picking\nat the years is to put these gift cards into effect because that's the one thing that\ntakes any input or any rationale for folks who might be willing to trade out winnings\nfor these game machines for cash. If we go to the gift cards, that takes care of that.\nSo in replacement for doing the gift cards, the CoM master license holders have agreed\nto pay an extra 1% of their proceeds to the lottery.\nSo that means it's starting in July 22 when the gift cards get fully implemented, where\nthey're paying 5% now in the retailer pays 5, then the master license holder will pay\n6% to the Georgia lottery.\nIf I hope y'all remember the numbers that I'd given last time was that this raises a tremendous\namount of money and it's the fastest-growing revenue source for the lottery at this time.\nMr. Speaker, I'd be glad to answer any questions and I would appreciate your favorable consideration.\nDid you yield for questions?\nI will.\nOkay, you've got some.\nChair recognizes Chairman Houston, do you arrive for a question?\nYes, sir.\nI'm trying to see where in here it said you named two members to the lottery board\nand I misunderstood you.\nHe didn't misunderstand.\nIf you look on page three, if you look on line 49 through 51, 49 to 51, I was just\nsaying that.\nLine 49-51.\nThe governor needs right now you have a chairperson of the Co-Am advisory board at the lottery.\nit would elevate that chair person up to the board,\nbut the governor gets to nominate or gets to add\none more member to the lottery commission.\nWhat, can I ask one more question?\nWhat percentage of the, is it the percentage\nof the gross price that go to the lottery\nor how is that determined?\nAnd back over the history of this industry\nand because of various and troubles and as it progressed,\nthese all these machines are hooked up to the lottery commission through the\nterminals. So the any money that goes in that on that growth that the lottery\ncommission gets 10% right now, 5% from the retailer, 5% from the masterholder,\nsoon to be 6%, not included in additional 7% taxes.\nBut that's 5% or 5% of what, of the gross national product,\nI mean, the profits of the clear of what they clear\non these machines, yes.\nNot what about the payout?\nPayout's is taken off and then the profit.\nSo we get 10%.\nThey get the state, the lottery gets 10% right now\nof what's cleared.\nThank you.\nYou're welcome.\nYou further yield?\nYes, sir.\nChair recognizes representative Stacy Evans\nin the gallery to your left.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nDoes the gentleman yield?\nYes, ma'am.\nMr. Chairman, isn't it true that I appreciate\nthat you and others worked really hard to add\nthe extra percent to be paid to the lottery\nfor education fund?\nI hope you're grateful and I appreciate your help.\nWill you further yield?\nI will.\nIsn't it also true that you and I agree\nthat these gift cards should help us\nclean up the paying of cash in the industry.\nYou're absolutely right.\nEven though these gift cards is predicted\nthat they'll bring in more revenue\nbecause it will make it a more legitimate industry,\nbut that is the number one issue I'd said it last time,\nand I'll say it now again,\nthat if a licensed game machine person,\nwhether it's in retail or otherwise,\nif they have the ability to do gift cards,\nthey would absolutely be too stupid to breathe if they pay it out cash because the\npaying out of cash and being caught is a death knail to that business and it\nsubjects them to criminal prosecution and a lifetime ban from the lottery or\nanything else. Will you yield for one more? Yes ma'am. Are you and I on the same\npage that if this gift card edition is as lucrative for the industry as we all\nthink it will be that we will be back here very soon asking for a higher\npercentage for the lottery for education fund. You know I can't answer that\nquestion. I know that a lot of the liberals in here they want to pick the\nbones of anything they can. For the kids thank you. Thank you.\nDo you further yield? Yes sir maybe one or two more maybe one with big\nbetter. Yes sir. Do you recognize this chairman Oliver? To your left for a question.\nDoes the gentleman yield? Yes ma'am. Is it? May I hope that you and I are on the same page about the\nlottery boards refusal to release reserves in a reasonable way? This bill doesn't direct the lottery\nboard to release it's 400% of reserves doesn't? No ma'am. Are you and I on the same page that the\nthe lottery board needs to release more of these reserves?\nYou know, I have no idea we're on the same page\non very many things.\nBut on this particular issue, don't you think\nthat the lottery board's refusal to release money\nfor the lottery, from the lottery,\nto pay for hope in pre-K is the bad decisions?\nI can look through this bill,\nbut I don't believe that's in this bill.\nMr. Speaker, I would certainly appreciate\na favorable consideration for the members of this House and this move this along so that\nwe can raise more money for the lottery and create a more secured environment around\nthe people doing business. Thank you.\nIs there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The\nprevious question is ordered. Is there any objection to withdrawing the committee substitute?\nThe chair here is none. The committee substitute is withdrawn. Is there any objection to adopting\nThe substitute offered by the committee on rules,\nthe chair here's none, the rules committee substitute\nis adopted, is there any objection\nto agreeing to the report of the committee,\nwhich was favorable to the passage of the bill,\nthe chair here's none, the report of the committee\nis agreed to.\nShall this bill now pass all those in favor\nof the passage of the bill will vote aye.\nThose opposed will vote no,\nand the clerk will unlock the machines.\nHave all members voted?\nall members voted have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the machines on the\nThe passage of Senate Bill 95, the eyes are 76, the nays are 89.\nThis bill having failed to receive the requisite constitutional majority is therefore lost.\nWhat purpose does Chairman Powell rise?\nLet's just speak, I move that this House reconsider the actions on this bill.\nAnd Paul has moved that this house reconsider its failure to give a requisite constitutional\nmajority to Senate Bill 95.\nAll of those in favor of reconsideration will vote aye.\nThose opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines.\nhave all members voted have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the machines on\nthe gentleman's motion that this house reconsider its action and failing to give the constitutional\nmajority to Senate Bill 95. The eyes are 100. The nasa 62. And this house has\nreconsidered its action. That bill will now go back to the general calendar.\nClerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 92.\nSenate Bill 92 by Senator Robertson of the 29th Anderson of the 24th Alvers of the 56th\nMulles of the 53rd and Paine of the 54th, and the title of the act to amend Part 1 of\nArticle 2 of Chapter 13 to Title 16, the fiscal to Georgia annotated relating schedules, offenses,\nand penalties regarding the regulation of controlled substances.\nLet's bill I refer to the committee on judiciary non-civilic committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute\nChair recognizes chairman Allen Powell to present the bill\nThank you, mr. Speaker and let me hope I'm a little bit better explaining this bill\nWell, Senate Bill 92, we had dealt with this issue earlier in the session.\nThis was doing the licensing for the PAs and the APRNs to administer Schedule II drugs.\nI went to the Senate and this is the product that came back in this form.\nWas it, they do approve it.\nIt was only one of the Schedule II drugs.\nThe milder version did it for three days so that they can do a prescription for three\ndays still allows it to, still mandates it just has to be reported to the doctor working\nunder that protocol either upon immediately or within no later than 72 hours.\nAlso continues to allow them to issue the placards for handicapped vehicles.\nAnd that Mr. Speaker is what it does.\nIt would just trim down considerably from five to three days\nand only one of the scheduled to use drugs.\nI believe it was the OXI, I don't know the difference in them,\nbut one of the questions.\nDo you yield for questions?\nOXI coding.\nYes, sir.\nChair recognizes representative Wolenski in room 341\nfor a question.\nThank you, does the chairman yield?\nYes, sir.\nIf I remember correctly, I could be wrong.\nThe first bill, or is it not true?\nThe first bill allowed five pills, not five days,\nand is this reducing it to three pills or three days?\nThis allowed, the first bill said five days,\na prescription for five days, and this goes to three days.\nThank you, Chairman.\nYou further yield?\nYes, sir.\nChair recognizes representative Reeves to your left for a question.\nYes, sir.\nIt's gentleman yield.\nYes, sir.\nIsn't it true, Chairman Powell, that this body overwhelmingly passed this measure a few\nweeks ago, and that this bill continues to be something that is going to be an enormous\nhelp for rural health care in Georgia?\nYou're absolutely right, given that 46 states in this nation allow prescriptive rights to\nVA's and APR's and that's a far cry from what we do.\nMr. Speaker, I would certainly appreciate the\nfavorable consideration of the members and I'll ask\nfor their vote and step aside.\nIs there any objection to the previous question being\nordered?\nThe chair here is none.\nThe previous question is ordered.\nIs there any objection to adopting the Committee\nSubstitute, the chair here is none.\nThe Committee Substitute is adopted.\nIs there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee?\nWhich was favorable to the passage of the bill.\nThe chair here is none.\nThe report of the committee is agreed to.\nShall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill?\nWill vote aye.\nThose opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines.\nYou\nAll members voted have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the machine on the\npassage of senate bill 92 the eyes are 162 the nasor 4 this bill having received the\nthe requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed,\nclerk will ring the caption to Senate Bill 85.\nSenate Bill 85, Senator Alvers, the 56th.\nStriclin of the 17th mill of the 49th,\nKennedy of the 18th of Stetler, the 52nd and others,\nto be taught an act to amend Code Section 16561\nof the fiscal to Georgia annotated, related to hazing.\nSo it's to provide for an expanded definition of hazing this bill ever for the committee on judiciary non-civil that committee recommends that this bill do pass\nby committee substitute\nChair recognizes chairman mandy balinger to present the bill\nThank you, mr. Speaker. This is the Max Grover act\nMax Grover was a young man who graduated from a Catholic high school bus of Trinity and Roswell, Georgia\nHe went to LSU and it was during a hazing incident there involving alcohol at LSU that he lost\nhis life his parents have now gone on a bit of a crusade to strengthen our hazing laws\nacross the state beginning in Louisiana and also in their home state of Georgia.\nThe first part of it just says that it's the Max Grover Act.\nThe second part of this bill allows for the definitions and the third part mandates that\nand each school have policies that facilitate the reporting and disclosure of hazing and also it allows for a public report of hazing to be on the website. Mr. Speaker, I'll stand for any questions.\nYou do not have any questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ask for your favorable consideration.\nIs there any objection to the previous question being ordered?\nThe Chair here's none.\nThe previous question is ordered.\nIs there any objection to adopting the Committee substitute?\nThe Chair here's none.\nThe Committee substitute is adopted.\nIs there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee,\nwhich was favorable to the passage of the bill?\nThe Chair here's none.\nThe report of the committee has agreed to.\nShall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage\nof the bill will vote aye.\nthose opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines.\nHave all members voted?\nHave all members voted?\nSo the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of Senate Bill 85.\nThe eyes are 164 the nasors zero.\nThis bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed.\nClerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 49.\nSenate Bill 49 by Senator Dixon, the 45th Miller, the 49th Anderson, the 24th Gouge, the 51st\nDuke, and the 30th and others.\nAny title of act to amend, Chapter 2, Title 8, in the fiscal day of Georgia, annotated\nrelaying the standards and requirements for construction, alteration of buildings and\nand other structures so as to provide procedures\nfor alternative plan review, permitting, and inspection.\nMr. Bill, I'm referring to the Committee on Agriculture\nConsumer Affairs.\nThat committee recommends that this bill do pass.\nChair recognizes representative Bonner\nto present the bill.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nAs a Saturday, I rise to present Senate Bill 49.\nThis is a continuation of the governor's agenda\nto help keep George's economy working during this pandemic.\nUnder current law, builders and contractors must wait\nfor the county or municipality to determine whether or not\nthey can provide services within the statutory timeframe\nbefore a private professional provider can be used.\nUnder Senate Bill 49, it will allow builders and contractors\nto use a private professional provider for plan review\nor inspection immediately upon acceptance of their application\nregardless of whether the county or municipality ultimately determines that\nthey could have performed the service. This bill was short in the timeline of\nbeing able to use a private professional provider thus increasing the\nefficiency and the building process across the state. This is currently what we\nhave in place. A builder goes to that municipality, submits their application,\nthat municipality has five days to review that application and to let that\ncontractor know whether or not they can provide that plan review. This simply\nallows those contractors to immediately put that municipality on notice that\nthey'll be using a third-party provider for that plan review and they'll still\nbe required to pay that municipality half of that fee. It does not preclude at\nall those municipalities from being involved throughout the inspection process,\nbut this will simply allow for those contractors and builders to move\nthrough that process that much faster.\nWith that, Mr. Speaker, that's the bill.\nI'll stand for any questions.\nYou have a question, too, if you care to yield.\nI'll yield.\nChair recognizes the minority caucus\nwith representative Wilkerson to your left for a question.\nDoes the gentleman yield?\nI do.\nJust to clarify, current law, you would have to go through the local municipality or government.\nIn this case, you'd get to pick who approves it, is that correct?\nWell, you are the municipalities under the law have the ability to pre-qualify companies and providers.\nSo you cannot bring in anyone that is not approved by that municipality.\nThank you for the question.\nYou further you?\nfor one more mystery. Chair recognizes representative dukes in room 341 for a\nquestion. With the gentleman you'll please. I will. Michael you said that the\nlocal building authorities will still be involved in the process. That is correct.\nI'm trying to to can you tell me what involvement with what they have you\nnumber because typically we have the plan review, then we're going to have foundation inspections\nand then roughing inspections if it's residential and then go through the whole litany of inspections.\nWhat if this field passes, what environment would the locals have?\nSo the local municipality will still have the ability to reject any of the inspectors\nthat are involved, they'll have the ability to review\nany of these plans if they choose,\nand they can show up at the job site at any point in time\nif they choose to do so.\nThank you.\nWith that, Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the well\nand ask for your favorable consideration.\nThe gentleman has yielded the well.\nIs there any objection to the previous question being ordered?\nThe chair hears none.\nThe previous question is ordered.\nIs there any objection to agreeing to the report\nof the committee, which was favorable\nthe passage of the bill. The chair here's none the report of the committee has\nagreed to.
