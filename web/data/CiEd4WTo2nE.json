I put on my bike shoes and I\nparticipated in an RPM class that's a\nspinning class most of you probably know\nthat's a class where you actually sit on\na stationary bike\nwith the most enthusiastic and demanding\ninstructor who has a voice that carries\nall the way to Atlanta I can promise you\nvery strongly coaching\nmaybe interpreted as yelling at us and\ntelling us to pedal and stand and sit\nand sweat for 45 minutes\nwhen we ride the equivalent of about 10\nto 12 miles\nit can be brutal\nbut it's one of those things that you do\nbecause it feels so good when you stop\ndoing it\nI always walk out of spin class with a\nlittle bit of a Swagger you know some\nsweat on my brow\nand I kind of walk past all the other\npeople that did not brave spin class\nthat morning and give them that nod like\nyou know I just did this\nand so I returned to the locker room I\nshower I dress for the day what a day to\nwhat a way to begin a day\na little self-pried not a lot of\nself-pride kind of creeps into that\nmoment\non this past Monday though my Apple\nwatch which tracks my athletic\nactivities bust\nI looked at the health app and it read\ncongratulations you've accomplished all\nyour goals for today\nit was 6 15 in the morning\nI'd accomplished everything that I had\nsaid as a goal for exercise for the\nwhole day\nnow the fact is it's based on an\nalgorithm that Apple does I don't\nunderstand it all but it takes your\ndaily activities it averages it figures\nout what your goals must be and so I\nstopped in the middle of the locker room\nand looked at my watch again just to\nmake sure it was right\nat first I kind of felt proud I had\naccomplished that\nthen I felt mortified\nI was ashamed that my daily goal was\nsomething that could be accomplished so\nquickly so early in the day\nmy goal wasn't set high enough evidently\nand I felt a little bit lost you know\nlike Alexander the Great there were no\nother worlds to conquer at least for\nthat day\nI remember the words of my dad a\nminister\nwho helped me write a prayer that I had\nto deliver at the morning devotion at\nRockdale County High School when I was\ngrowing up\nand what Dad said is I said dad what do\nI put in that prayer he said\none thing to say is Lord please help me\nto set my goals high enough to be a\nchallenge\nbut low enough to be reached\nnow I understand not not setting\nimpossible goals but I do need to know\nthat my goals are high enough that I'll\nbe stretched to the Limit and actually\nmake bold efforts to do something that\ntruly matters something that is\nsacrificial something that reaches\nbeyond the boundaries of expectation\nthat tests the limits of my ability no\npain no gain\nI've always been one of those who\nbelieve that you should dream in\npossible dreams and work with all of\nyour might to accomplish them\nI remember the words of John Kennedy and\nit addressed to the crowd at Rice\nUniversity we choose to go to the moon\nin this decade and do other things not\nbecause they're easy but because they're\nhard\nhis campaign song was high hopes\nyet today we live in a world that tempts\nus to play it safe compromise our dreams\neven our values and not take chances\nwe're drawn towards safe things while\nnothing has ever been accomplished by\nplaying it safe\nit takes bold dreams to represent people\nan uncompromising Spirit to take on\nchallenges of the day the ability to\ndream The Impossible and to work to make\nthe impossible possible\nand a steadfast faith in the Limitless\nopportunities that lie before us\nthat's what it takes\nwe have people in our wonderful State\nwho've gone beyond what anyone ever\nthought any human being could do\nthey've invented they've developed\nthey've LED strengthened built achieved\ncreated and accomplished more than\nanyone would had they played it safe\nwe knew we were not finished for the day\nby 6 15 in the morning\nwhat we have done is only a Prelude to\nwhat we will do next\nin a world that gives trophies to\neveryone and is loath to acknowledge\nSuperior accomplishment we have the\nopportunity to be a chamber that sets\nthe example for Big Dreams amazing\naccomplishments humble service and an\ninspiring others to do their very best\nand you do you are examples for people\nyoung people in this state\nyou are the people who lead the way in\nInnovation and hope never set your goal\nso low that you finish too early in the\nday\nas individuals who represent the people\nof Georgia we are depending upon you I\nas a citizen am depending upon you to be\nbold and never allow the pressures fears\nhesitation to hamper your mission to\ntake our state to where it's never gone\nbefore in quality of life for all\ncitizens and prosperity for everyone\nGod blesses the Bold Spirit of one who\ntrusts in him and uses gifts and\nopportunities he's given them he wants\nyou and me to do the right needful and\nimportant things not because they're\neasy but because they're hard\nJeremiah 32 17 says Ah Lord God it is\nyou who have made the heavens and the\nEarth by your great power and by your\noutstretched arm nothing is too hard for\nyou\nknowing that we should never set our\nsights too low\nif you have something you really believe\nin\nsomething that needs to be done for the\ngood of the people something that has\nstrong moral and ethical base go for it\nboldly make sure it's part of your\ncommitment\nthe Apostle Paul said forgetting the\nthings that are behind and reaching\nforth to the things that are before I\npress on toward the mark of the prize of\nthe call of God in Christ Jesus\nyou have a high calling\nmatch it with high expectations Robert\nFrost said Freedom lies in being bold\nas for me I'm

possible for our citizens\nand by the way it got 92 percent of the\nvote I think it was the most heavily\nsupported initiative in last year's\ngeneral election but what this bill will\ndo now is that our our local governments\nand this is this the cities counties\nschool boards they will get to determine\nthemselves what type of relief they can\ngive to our citizens who are dealing\nwith this

the\nground in the operating rooms and on the\nmedical floors with doctors and nurses\nNurse Practitioners and PAs across\nGeorgia that does this by offering a tax\ncredit to preceptor Physicians

thousand\ndollars a month up to 10 a year it does\npreclude you from getting paid as a as a\npreceptor for any other other locations\nit's limited as I said to 10 a year\nbecause we want this to be a high\nquality experience for our students it's\nproven to be very successful this bill\nwill add Dentistry to that that will\nallow dentists to for dental students\nwho want to go see real world

bill\nthank you Mr Speaker ladies and\ngentlemen of the house I bring before\nyou house bill 505.\nGeorgians proudly defend the rights of\npeaceful protesters but will not\ntolerate violence that damages people or\nproperty\nliberal cities that have created\nautonomous zones for law Breakers have\ncreated trouble unsafe and unsanitary\nconditions for residences and businesses\nwe will not let that happen here\nour governor and our attorney general\nhave made it clear that Georgia will\nprovide no Safe Haven to rioters\nthis legislation puts that Vision into\nstate law and sends a signal to\ntroublemakers throughout the country\nthat they won't get a slap on the wrist\nif they come here and engage in rioting\nwe will prosecute the violent in order\nto protect the peaceful and innocent\nthe violence we saw recently that grew\nout of the violent riots against the\nAtlanta Public Safety Training Center\nwas broadcast far beyond our state lines\nwith our downtown dependent upon\nconvention and tourism dollars we must\nprotect that industry from the brand\ndamage that would result from further\nriots\nthe only thing that this bill does\nis it increases the penalty for criminal\noffense of riot\nfrom a misdemeanor to a felony\nlet me repeat that\nfrom a misdemeanor to a felony\nthe second thing that it does\nis it adds Riot to the list of offenses\nthat must have Baal decided by a\nsuperior court judge\nas chairman of the Small Business\nDevelopment Committee\nI feel that is my responsibility to put\nsupport the thousands of small\nbusinesses across the state\nfrom restaurants Beauty parlors clothing\nstores\nto convenience stores jewelry stores\ntattoo shops\nthese violent Acts\nof riots provide a dangerous environment\nfor the businesses to operate it is not\nonly detrimental to the business owners\nbut more importantly to their employees\ntheir staff\nand their patrons\nsmall businesses are the largest\nemployers in the state\nthey provide more jobs than any other\nentity\nthese small businesses provide the\nmanpower to coach little league\nraise money for local school programs\nsupport the Boy and Girl Scouts and help\nwith local disasters\nin so many cases small businesses are\nfamily endeavors I know from personal\nexperience that my children helped me\nit is unfair for small businesses to\nface the additional threat of riot\nespecially now after so many were closed\nduring the covid-19 crisis\nHB 505 will help small business\nthank you Mr Speaker I yield for about\ntwo or three questions\ngentlemen will yield for our question to\nyour left\nrepresentative Kelly from the 16th has a\nquestion\nthank you Mr Speaker with the gentleman\nyield yes sir I'll yield now chairman\nchokos isn't it true that what we're\ntrying to focus in this bill are on\nthese violent rights and we've had some\ndiscussion uh debate that\nthis could be applied just as simply as\nif two individuals got in a fight we've\nheard that in the debate isn't that true\nyes sir but isn't true that's not what\nwe're focused on here that's true it's\non violence and so isn't it further true\nMr chairman that\nunder current law that they a simple\nfight between between two individuals\ncouldn't be charged under this right\nstatute according to the rule of\nleniency and the misdemeanor offense of\na Fray isn't that true yes sir all right\nthank you Mr chairman\nthank you thank you for that question\ngentlemen yield yes sir I do\nrepresentative hugely to your left again\nhas a question yes ma'am thank you Mr\nSpeaker does the gentleman yield yes\nma'am can you explain to us what in your\nmind is the definition of a ride and how\na police officer would not act that on\nlike they tack on every other charge\nwhen they arrest people\num\nwell\nit has to be two or more people that are\ninvolved in a in a violent Act\nand according to case law\nRiot requires common intent and a\nconcert action of intent so in other\nwords the the example that was used in\nthe rules committee whereas you have a\nballroom brawl you have two people\nopposing to each other that would not be\nvalid at this time it's totally\nirrelevant it's where two or more people\nhave a common intent\nto create a to create violence and so\nthat's that would be the definition that\nwe're working from and it's already in\ncase law\nthank you gentlemen yield for another\nquestion\nsir this will be the last one\nrepresentative\nlet's see the uh\nMajority Leader illustration has a\nquestion I guess I best recognize them I\nthink so\nfamous speakers the gentleman yield yes\nsir sir isn't it true as you just\npointed out the definition of Riot is\nalready in law and that is unchanged as\npart of your bills that is absolutely\ncorrect and isn't it also true that as\nuh to the question that was raised in\nthe rules committee if there were to be\na fight that occurs between between\nindividuals that meets the definition of\na misdemeanor a Fray that actually by\nlaw the prosecutor must charge the\nmisdemeanor offense\nif there are not additional elements\nthat would otherwise require a\nheightened charge isn't that true that\nis also true sir thank you enough for\nthank you thank you for that question as\nI said earlier it requires a common\nintent uh and a concerted action to\ncreate violence and with that Mr Speaker\nI asked for the body's favorable\nconsideration and I yield a well thank\nyou sir\nthe gentleman has yielded the well we're\ngoing to move on to additional speakers\nwe have um several people who'll speak\nI'm going to recognize representative\nCrawford\nfor the um\nokay we'll change that order then\nrepresent the audensonia will be\nrecognized to speak to the bill now you\nhave a total of 30 minutes\nand that can be uh split up any way you\ndesire as you speak to the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker\nmembers of the House of Representatives\nI rise in opposition to house bill 505.\nI know sometimes some of us may feel\npressured\nto vote along with party members\nbut I want you all to stay with me for\njust a couple minutes\non March 7 1965.\nJohn Lewis and hundreds of protesters\ngathered on the Edmond bridge in Selma\nAlabama\nto exercise their first amendment\nthe right\nof the people\nto peacefully Assemble\nand to express their grievances to the\ngovernment\nin this instance\nthe policeman attacked this peaceful\nprotesters\ninjured many of them\nwho locked arms together\nand fought for the freedom\nin our highest\nAmerican values\nof their sacrifice paved way for so many\nof us to sit in this chamber\nespecially those of you that look like\nme and to all of the women\nirrespective of your party\nit is evident that the policeman incited\na riot\nin this day in our history is known as\nthe Bloody Sunday\nin 1848\nElizabeth Stanton\nalong with over 300 women\ngathered in Seneca Falls New York\nto peacefully exercise their First\nAmendment right\nthese women wanted to be treated as\nindividuals\nand not dependence of men\nthey wanted more employment\nopportunities they wanted educational\nopportunities\nthey wanted freedom to run for office\nand to speak in front of Congress\nand to vote\nthrough the effort\nwe see all of you amazing women sitting\nhere today\nmaking a difference and making Georgia\nbetter\nnow while the legislators behind this\nbill\nmay suggest this language only targets\nprotesters engaging crimes of violence\nthis bill expressly contemplates\nnon-criminal conduct or just take a look\nat lines 11 and 12 of the bill\nit defined Riot as\ntwo or more individuals engaged\nin either one\nunlawful act of violence or two\nany other act committed in a violent and\ntumultuous manner\nthink about that for a second\nthis language leaves a gray area\nany other act committed\nan act of violence and tumultuous manner\nthis implies that there are some types\nof non-criminal conduct\nthat may rise to the level of\nIran when performed by two or more\npeople\nand then this bill is asking you all to\nvote yay\nto make it a felony\nto protest\nand then be punishable up to 20 years\n20.\nto break it down in simpler terms\nwhat this bill is asking for is that\ndo not dare\nto assemble and exercise your\nFirst Amendment\nwe have seen many times where\nlaw enforcement consciously arouses\npeaceful protesters\nand then be the one to spark the riot\nand we are asking this protesters\nto be punishable up to 20 years\na while it may feel good\nto some of us to\nalways want to be surrounded by the yes\nyes type of people\njust take a look at countries where\nleaders\nlimits the rights of its citizens\nor ability to express their grievances\nwe have come too far and we have fought\ntoo hard\nto go back\nfor the men and women who sacrificed\ntheir lives to pave the way for us\nin the pursuit of freedom\nwe must and we have to do everything we\ncan to protect our right to assemble\nin our rights\nto a peaceful protest\nthank you very much thank you Mr Speaker\nI yield\nthe gentleman has healed the well\nrepresentative Crawford is recognized to\nspeak to the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker\ncolleagues the day I Rise to oppose\nHouse Bill 505. there should always be a\ncause for concern if bad policies are\npursued and implemented\nunder house bill 505 a person would be\nguilty of a felony should they commit\nthe offense of a riot which is defined\nas two or more persons doing an unlawful\nact of violence or any other act in a\nviolent and tumultuous manner\nI know that's convoluted and vague right\nbut let's look at what this really means\npractically\nsome of my colleagues one in particular\njust spoke about what this bill could do\nto impact protest which is essential to\nour democracy and the fundamental First\nAmendment right\nindeed I agree with his testimony and\nAnalysis however this bill could have\nfar more detrimental consequences in the\nlives of other everyday Georgians\nit won't only impact protesters but it\ncould impact others how do I know this\nbecause case law tells me so\nif we determine if we want to determine\nhow an amended bill will impact the\npeople all we have to do is look at what\nthe original bill has done in the past\nand we don't have to look too far\nour Georgia court of appeals previously\nheld that there was sufficient evidence\nto charge teenagers under the same\nstatute because of their involvement in\nproximity to a neighborhood fight\nin this particular case a group of kids\ngot upset with one another exchanged\nwords and exchanged blows after those\nwords and this drew a crowd that has\nnothing too uncommon from any of our\ndistricts unfortunately\nkids engage in fighting\nbut what this case law held is that\nmultiple kids involved even as\nspectators\nwere charged under a misdemeanor at the\ntime of inciting a riot and\nparticipating in a riot\nand so now we're about to increase the\npenalty for neighborhood fights amongst\nour kids\ndoing so would be disastrous but I get\nit some of you all are thinking to\nyourselves that your child isn't the one\nthat's fighting right\nwell the Court's analysis wasn't that\nsimple it didn't solely focus on the\nkids involved in the fight with the\nCourt held is that because the Essential\nElements of inciting a riot were in\npertinent in part engaging in conduct\nwhich urges or advises others to Riot or\nfight\na child preventing someone from breaking\nup a fight\nurging someone to fight or simply being\na bystander could also result in the\nfelony charge should this bill pass\nsurely I'm not advocating that our youth\nengage in confrontation but if our\nteenagers your teenagers have a lapse in\njudgment and be involved in or\npotentially be in proximity of a\nconfrontation they could face a felony\ncharge which will have a negative result\non their life's trajectory\nnow proponents of this bill May rely on\nwhat they deem to be prosecutorial\ndiscretion\nand that's a way of them saying that a\nprosecutor would have the ability to\ncharge someone\nfor any act but the biggest downside of\nprosecutorial discretion is that it\noften results in selective prosecution\nand so a prosecutor's personal beliefs\nand biases whether conscious or\nunconscious can creep into their\ndecisions and like always the poor\nminorities we know will be impacted\nbut House Bill 505 could also negatively\nimpact others outside of the poor\nminorities\nmultiple kids can be vulnerable\na child watching a fight which many of\nus have probably done in the past could\nbe detained for up to a year think about\nthat\nand I know that we oftentimes choose\nsides in the people's house but\nimmaturity is bipartisan a lapse in\njudgment is bipartisan adolescent\nmisbehavior is bipartisan School fights\nhappen neighborhood fights happen the\nirony is is that we teach Youth\nDevelopment on one hand but then we\ncreate laws like this which could\ndeteriorate the future of our youth on\nthe other\nbut it won't stop at just kids\nthis bill could also have an impact on\nsomeone at a football game potentially\nat a tailgate should their actions rise\nto what this definition says is a riot\nthis is a bad policy with clear legal\nimplications that threatens to harm the\nlives of Georgians based on\nself-ambitious politics of trying to\nlook tough on crime this bill will do\nfar more good than harm far more harm\nthan good and I urge my colleagues to\nvote no on House Bill 505. thank you Mr\nSpeaker I yield the well\nthe gentleman has yielded the well\nthat completes those\ndesire to speak in opposition to the\nbill now we'll hear\nfor 30 minutes up to 30 minutes\nfor those in favor of the bill\nrepresentative Reeves is recognized to\nspeak to the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker I'm proud to speak\nin favor of House Bill 505 this is a\nvery serious piece of legislation that\nhas far-reaching consequences for the\nthe safety of homes of businesses and of\nuh our our private property here in\nGeorgia I'm here from the Suburban\nperspective from Duluth and Swanee and\nSugar Hill my constituents work really\nhard they play by the rules they've come\nto Gwinnett County from all around\nGeorgia All Around America and all\naround the world to work hard and live\nby the American dream and they have\ninvested all across Atlanta including in\nplaces that have been adversely uh\nharmed by riots the last few years and\nuh this bill will give you an\nopportunity to stand up and defend the\nrights of peaceful protesters but to\ndraw a clear line that peaceful protest\ndoes not allow people to cross the line\ninto violence and to property\ndestruction if they choose to cross that\nline from First Amendment free speech to\nviolence\nand harm to people and property then\nGeorgia law is going to uh uh come down\non them under this bill free speech\nyour free speech rights end where the\nother person's personal safety and\nproperty begin that's a tradition in\nAmerica that this legislation honors\nthis legislation puts into state law and\nsends a signal to troublemakers around\nthe country and you've seen the\nphenomenon literally of having tourists\nwho come to certain areas and Destroy\nproperty and harm people that they have\nuh no ties to and that that happened\nrecently I had a mayor and two city\ncouncil members who came to a uh\nconference that a lot of y'all had the\nopportunity to attend and the night\nbefore\nthey had gone out to eat in Atlanta and\nthey were a few blocks away from what\nunder this bill would be a riot and by\nthe way uh those protesters\nmost of them were not minorities and a\nlot of them were not even from Georgia\nand they they broke Windows they set uh\nthings on fire that was not free speech\nthat was not peaceful protest and that's\nnot the kind of thing we can afford\nliterally we can't afford to have that\ngoing on in Atlanta or anywhere else in\nGeorgia both my parents grew up in\nrepresentative chokos's district and\nAmericus Georgia and his communities are\nMain Street towns but mine are two in\nGwinnett County we've got a million\npeople there and they're about 15\ncommunities and uh there are Decades of\nhard work and investment in every home\nand every business in my area and in\nevery uh small town in representative\nchokis's district in Middle Georgia\nwhere I spent five years and to have\npeople particularly outside protesters\ncoming to Georgia and harm people and\nbreak things and damage property that's\nnot free speech that's not peaceful\nprotest and that is not the proud\nHeritage that this state has of getting\nout there and exercising peaceful\nprotests and persuading by the force of\nreason and intellect and The Ballot Box\nnot by breaking windows and beating\npeople up\nI told you about the mayor and council\nmember for my community who Could Have\nBeen In Harm's Way and uh they saw\nbusinesses that were harmed by rioters I\nalso want to speak about someone from\nSwanee who invested in an area between\nhere and the airport really close to\nthat Wendy's that got burned down after\na tragedy happened that should not have\nhappened but to respond to one tragedy\nwith going in and burning down a\nrestaurant that that doesn't make things\nbetter and what it does is it makes\npeaceful business owners like my\nconstituent from Swanee who was out\nthere serving patients and getting\nmedication to people with diabetes and\nsenior citizens it makes them worried\nabout investing in communities this bill\nsays in Georgia you'll be safe you could\nspeak your mind you could peacefully\nprotest but don't go hurt people and\nbreak things\nuh number three I had a high school\nstudent recently contact me and say I\nwant to apply for this Georgia National\nGuard scholarship at University of North\nGeorgia it was a North Gwinnett High\nSchool student and three of us three or\nfour of us here in the room share that\nHigh School cluster and this young lady\nwants to uh go into public service and\nmilitary service part-time while getting\nher college degree and then be obligated\nto serve our state and the uh Georgia\nNational Guard after she graduates well\nfreedom is not free when there are\npeaceful protesters law enforcement and\nin some cases National Guard they're\nobligated to protect those peaceful\nprotesters and that's good and Georgia\nhas a proud history judge boodle who I\ngot to hear he laid down the law in the\n50s and 60s and he said law enforcement\nis obligated to protect peaceful\nprotesters he was appointed by Calvin\nCoolidge and he was still deciding cases\nin the 60s and he was still speaking to\ncollege students in the 90s judge\nGriffin Bell he was appointed by\nPresident Kennedy judge Bell who was\nfrom Americus Georgia where\nrepresentative chokos is from he said\nlaw enforcement military have an\nobligation to protect peaceful\nprotesters but unfortunately as you saw\nin 2020 law enforcement and the military\nthey get called out when all hell breaks\nloose and when people are getting hurt\nphysically and when things are getting\nbroken and to have law-abiding\nhard-working National Guard people and\nlaw enforcement get called in to pick up\nthe pieces when people are getting hurt\nand things are getting broken to me\nthat's unconscionable for us to have\nanything to do with that we need to send\na message to Violent protesters and\npeople destroying property you can't do\nthat in Georgia we will listen to you\nall day long you have a right to vote\nyou have a right to persuade you don't\nhave a right to harm people and property\nin Georgia speaking to to the precedent\nthat representative chokis consulted in\ndrafting this bill is Loomis versus\nState and it's Dixon versus state\nspeaking to the wording of the bill\nany two or more persons who shall do an\nunlawful act of violence violence not\nfree speech not peaceful protests but\nviolence or any other act in a violent\nand tumultuous manner commit the offense\nof Riot period that's it one sentence\nlong and both elements of that crime\nrequire violence the tumultuous the\nlanguage of that is a mob it's mob rule\nif you get together and have a mob that\ncrosses the line into violence that's\nwhen Riot is declared under this statute\nand it has made a felony\num I had some Korean constituents invite\nme to a documentary that was well done\nand it showed the tragedy that happened\nin California in the 1990s after another\ntragedy happened you had uh police\nbrutality and a minority uh was uh\nassaulted by the police but then the\nriot that occurred after that destroyed\nthe dreams\nin the Korean community and in the\nneighborhood there in in California and\npeople are still traumatized decades\nlater from both the police incident as\nwell as the aftermath that was Riot and\nwe can't have rioting here in Georgia\npeople are entitled to live in their\nhomes and run their businesses large or\nsmall without the fear of mob Rule and\nviolence and that's why I'm proud to\nsupport this bill and I would encourage\nyou to read the bill and to make a clear\nstand that Georgia is a safe place to\nlive and to do business to peacefully\nprotest to speak your mind and exercise\nyour first amendment rights but Georgia\nis not a place where Riley Riot and\nviolence are tolerated thank you\nthe gentleman has yielded the well\nthat completes the discussion for those\nopposed and those in favor\nis there any objection to the previous\nquestion being ordered\nthe chair here has done the previous\nquestion is ordered now we'll have the\nChairman's time up to 20 minutes\nchairman Jay Collins chair of the\ncommittee from which this bill came is\nrecognized to speak to the Bill thank\nyou Mr Speaker I'm going to keep my\ncomments brief because I don't believe I\ncan say anything that'll change anyone's\nmind if mine's probably already made up\nyou've been down to my office in 218\nyou'll see that I have a 24 by 36\ncollage\nand it was from several years ago and I\nwas had the privilege of meeting\nCongressman John Lewis\nyou see before I became a state\nrepresentative I was mayor of my little\nCommunity out in Villa Rica Georgia\nwe honored the 50th anniversary of the\nFreedom Riders out there\nand I got to meet a living legend and I\ngot to talk to him\nand I I still consider him to be one of\nthe greatest men that I have ever met we\nwere the only city in this state who\nhonored that 50th anniversary of that\nfreedom rider bus\ncoming through Georgia as it traveled\nand I was very proud of that day for my\ncommunity to see the light the the look\non people's faces that lived through the\nterrible times that Congressman Lewis\nhad to go through and to be able to meet\na hero what a great day it was for my\ndistrict My Town my community I was very\nproud of that\nand I said that to say this\nwe should protect peaceful protesters\nat all expense at all cost\ntoday we have peacefully protested\nagainst each other in this chamber we\nhave spoke our mind and we have spoke\nour position\nthere's no violence ladies and gentlemen\nI think the number one and it's been\nsaid before and I'll say it again right\nhere the number one priority for\ngovernment should be to protect persons\nand property\nyou know these these uh protesters that\nwe have seen I want to call them\nprotesters excuse me let me call them\nwriters because that's what they are\nthey're they're really not from our\nstate they're being paid to come in here\nto write to loot to cause chaos and\nhavoc in our communities my district is\nfine if we don't pass this legislation\nmy district is fine majority of your\ndistricts will be fine but I'm thinking\nabout some of those people that live in\nthe impoverished economically depressed\nareas that experience right and looting\nand the the turmoil and the fear that\nmany of those residents had when they\nturned on the news when they looked down\ntheir street and they saw their City\nburning\nthey saw a police force that wasn't\ndoing anything about it\nladies and gentlemen we have to take\nsteps in this house to protect people\nand I think a lot of attention has been\ndrawn away from the fact that this has\nto do with riding not peaceful protests\nI would stand here I will fight for\npeople in the hall I will fight for\npeople in my district in your District\nto peacefully protest any day of the\nweek but make no mistake gentlemen\ngentlemen and gentle women here in this\nchamber this is not about peaceful\nprotesters this is about riding and\nsending a clear message that we want to\nprotect everyone from Every zip code\nfrom every district and we want to\nprotect persons and property and that's\nall I have to say about that Mr Speaker\nand I'm going to yield the balance of my\ntime to a whipper\nchairman has yielded his time the\nremainder of his time to went Burchette\nrepresenting burchett is recognized to\nspeak to the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker and thank you\ncolleagues well we're into the thick of\nit now aren't we this is uh this is what\nwe're here for this is what it's all\nabout the the debate I appreciate the\ncolleagues on both sides of this issue\nuh but I'm just here to clarify a few\nthings and and this and boil it down\ninto plain plain language\nthis is about two policy perspectives\nhere\nare you in favor of making Riot a felony\nand are you in favor of requiring that\nsomeone that is charged with a riot to\nsit before a superior court judge before\nthey have Bond that's it we're not\nchanging the definition of riot we're\nnot changing we're not adding a Fray\nwe're not adding inciting a riot though\nmy colleagues have argued that I believe\nthat they're off base on the argument\nthe only thing we are changing is if you\nare charged and convicted with uh being\na party to a riot then it could be you\ncan serve it'll be a felony not a\nmisdemeanor and that's it\nthis uh this business about\num inciting a riot I would point you to\nthe bill just look at the bill\num I'll walk through it with you if you\nlike\nsection one\num\nthe language on 14 to 15 that's the\nlanguage that changes from misdemeanor\nto a felony that's the that's the only\nchange there\nsection two\nwe're adding line 22 Riot to the crimes\nthat you must sit before Superior Court\nJudge to to receive a bond\nno inciting a ride\nNoah Frey none of those things we're not\nchanging the definition of Orion we're\nnot expanding the definition of Orion\nthat is that's a fallacy to think that\nthe argument that this could be an\naffray is\nis unfounded because in an affray the\nelement of\num\ndoing doing a violent act in concert is\nnot there and a Fray is just an affray\nit's a fight\nwe're not we're not acting together\nviolently to destroy the streets of\nFulton County and Atlanta we're not\nwe're not burning uh police cars we're\nnot tearing up the local businesses and\nand hey you all were here a lot of you\nwere here a lot of you weren't here\nbecause we have a large freshman class\nbut I recall those days I remember the\nleaders of Atlanta Georgia standing at\nthe Capitol steps asking pleading please\nplease\nplease\npeacefully protest don't destroy my\nbusiness that I've worked for my entire\nlife my kids my grandparents have\nstarted I remember that do you all\nremember that\nI remember that this is this is the\npolicy that we are putting forward today\nto the House of Representatives of\nGeorgia is that it's not okay to come to\nAtlanta to come to Georgia and and\nbecause you're upset\ndestroy\nour livelihoods just commit violence on\nour Georgia Citizens many of you recall\njust recently with the public safety\ncenter we had uh several individuals\nthat were charged with a riot and in 48\nhours two of those individuals were\nalready out\nand and they were not even from the\nstate of Georgia as I understand they\ncome here\nto run them up\nwe're that's not Georgia that's not\nGeorgia and while I appreciate my my\ncolleagues\num\ndebating on the opposite side of this I\nwould just point you straight to the\nbill\nwe're not talking about inciting rights\nwe're not talking about afraid we're\ntalking about\nwhat the crime and penalty will be if\nyou are taking part in a riot and so I\nwould ask an employer each and every\nmember here vote for the bill I know\nwe're gonna likely vote party lines and\nthat's fine that's okay I understand\nbut I'd appreciate if we could just work\ntoward\num some common ground at some point on\nsome of these issues that\nI think we need to be the leaders of in\nin this state and lead lead our\ndistricts back home and say hey we can\nwork together so I'm going to leave you\nall with that I certainly appreciate the\nopportunity to speak to you and listen I\nappreciate serving when each and every\none of you every day so thank you for\nall all of what you do and please vote\nFebruary for this Bill thank you Mr\nSpeaker\nthe gentleman has yielded the well\nthat completes our discussion on the\nbill is there any objection to agreeing\nto the report of the committee which was\nfavorable to the passage of the bill\nchair here's none the report of the\ncommittee is agreed to shall this bill\nnow pass all in favor of the passage of\nthe bill will vote Yes all those opposed\nwill vote no and the clerk will unlock\nthe machine\nclose yeah\nunreal\noh my God\nfor what purpose does representative\nBruce rise\nparliamentary inquiry State your inquiry\nis it not true that if my brother and I\nwho happened to have a common interest\ns were out protesting\nand someone attacked us because they\ndidn't agree with us\nand we defended ourselves and it turned\nout to be a pretty bloody fight\nthat I would now go from\nself-defense to a felony\nunder this bill\nif the gentleman slow States I'm sure\nthat's how he understands the bill\nfor what purpose does chairman chokos\nrise parliamentary inquiry State your\ninquiry\nMr Speaker\nwe have been talking about violence\nand isn't it true\nthat\none of our two Nobel Peace Prize winners\nthe Reverend Martin Dr Luther Reverend\nDr Martin Luther King said non-violence\nis a powerful and just weapon\nwhich Cuts without wounding\nand in Nobles the man who wields it\nit is a sword that heals thank you Mr\nSpeaker\nI'm sure the gentleman believes\neverything he just said\nrepresentative Roman is recognized\nfor what purposes she rise thank you Mr\nSpeaker parliamentary inquiry State\ninquiry is it not true that the words\nproperty and business do not appear\nanywhere in this bill and the best way\nto protect peaceful protesters is to\nvote no on this bill\nyet the lady so States I'm sure she\nbelieves that\nfor what purposes represent representing\nmatahan rise\nparliamentary inquiry Mr Speaker State\nyour inquiry isn't it true that this\nbill would prevent the all too common\noccurrence of a violent Rider being\narrested before lunch and released on\nbail in time for dinner\nwell I'm sure the gentleman States\nthat's that's his reading of the bill\nfor what purpose does\nrepresenting Becky Evans rise\ninquiry statue inquiry thank you isn't\nit true that in committee we heard from\nuh testimony that the definition of a\nriot had not been updated in over a\nhundred years and if my colleague the\nmajority whip says he wants to work with\nus I would hope that\nwe could work on updating that case law\nthank you if the Lady Sue States I'm\nsure that's what she heard\nwe're going to finish this one I'm going\nto do a couple more inquiries we'll go\nto uh let's see for what purpose does\nrepresentative manner rise\nparliamentary inquiry\nisn't it true that state inquiry thank\nyou Mr Speaker isn't it true that kids\non buses are fighting and this would be\nconsidered a riot and if we don't\nprotect the kids from rioting on school\nbuses not only will these kids end up\nbeing felons but then we put ourselves\nin a predicament because parents once\nthis bill is passed they'll question\nwhat are the schools doing about all of\nthese felon rioters and in addition to\nthat Mr Speaker there are several\ninstances and Pernell Harris who died\nwhile handcuffs were on him he was beat\nby police officers here in Georgia does\nthat mean Mr Speaker that these police\nofficers have now committed a felony\nthe lady has good questions and I'm sure\nher\nreading of the bill will help her answer\nthose questions or she can speak to the\nauthor I'm going to take two more\ntwo more\nrecognized\nfor what purpose is represent\nrepresented Hughley rise\nparliamentary income Mr Speaker State\nyour inquiry Mr Speaker isn't it true\nthat at the end of the day uh when\npolice officers make the arrest they're\nthe ones who putting the charges on\nthese individuals and it's going to cost\nparents and family members a lot more\nmoney to get people out of jail so that\nthey can go and then uh have their day\nin court and be afforded the opportunity\nso this is this is going to cost more\nmoney for individual citizens uh isn't\nit true further true that people who\nbreak the law are not watching us\nand know that we're making this a higher\npenalty but families are the ones that\nare going to suffer\nI appreciate the ladies View and I know\nshe believes in what she speaks is true\nfor what purposes representative Holcomb\nrise\nparliamentary inquiry State your inquiry\nMr Speaker isn't it true that while I\nsupport the goal of\nopposing the destruction of property in\nthe commission of violence that Georgia\ncourts have interpreted this statute\nas being that all persons sharing in a\nriot are guilty whether or not their\nconduct was in fact violent and\ntumultuous and that is very concerning\nI'm sure the gentleman believes that\nit's a learner practitioner of the law\nand a dedicated reader of legislation so\nwe appreciate your\ninsight\nwhat purpose does representative Neil\nrise\nparliamentary inquiry State inquiry is\nit not true that the issue people have\nis that if we are turning this to a\nfelony the issue of discretion being\nused misused and substituted for another\ncharge\ninstead of using afraid or the\nappropriate charge Riot being used in\nsubstitution of that and that is what is\ngiving\na lot of a lot of members in this body\npause\nwell I've heard several opinions about\nseveral different parts of the how you\ninterpret what we were talking about\nwhere we're debating what I do\nknow that the gentlelady believes just\nwhat she speaks to be the truth and\nthat's how that's her understanding\nthis is the last one\nwhat purpose is Chairman Sainz rise\nparliamentary inquiry State your inquiry\nis it not true that some would like to\nscapegoat this issue to youth\nmisbehavior and civil protests but that\nthis bill actually addresses those who\nwould like to desecrate our first\namendment rights by instilling Terror\nand fear in this very City in the small\nbusiness and minority-owned businesses\nall across the state\nI'm sure the gentleman believes of what\nhe States\nhave all members voted\nhave all members voted I think we've\nthoroughly discussed this proposition\nhave all members voted that I believe\nthey have so the clerk will lock the\nmachine\non the passage of the bill the yeas were\n98 the Nays 73 the bill having received\nthe requisite constitutional majority is\ntherefore passed\nMr Clark will you read the caption to HB\n500.\nhousehold 500 by representative silcox\nthe 53rd and others to be entitled an\nact two men article 3 chapter 7 the\ntitle 16 either fish go to George\nannotated relating arson and explosives\nthis was a revived for the offensive\narson of the law enforcement vehicle\nthis bill ever referred to the Committee\non Public Safety and Homeland Security\nthat committee recommends that this bill\ndo pass\nthank you Mr clerk I'll remind the\nmembers\nthat the rules committee had limited\ndebate on this issue to uh one hour\n30 minutes will be allocated equally to\neach side to be allocated between\nthemselves as they see fit those opposed\nand certainly those in favor\nagain that does not include the\npresentation by the author or the 20\nminutes for the Minority Report or the\nChairman's time\nthat's what we're going to do\nthis time chair lady silcox is\nrecognized to present the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker\nladies and gentlemen of the house I\nbring to you today House Bill 500\nHouse Bill 500 provides that anyone by\nmeans of fire or explosives that\nknowingly causes encourages or procures\nanother to set fire to a law enforcement\nvehicle would be guilty of the crime of\narson of a law enforcement vehicle\nanyone found guilty of this crime would\nbe punchable by fond of a hundred\nthousand dollars and or five to twenty\nyears and there is no mandatory minimum\nsentence\na police vehicle is the primary tool\nwith which our dedicated officers\nenforce our criminal laws\nthey are equipped with specialized\nequipment often bringing the cost of\nthese vehicles well over a hundred\nthousand dollars\nthese vehicles are paid for with our\nhard-earned taxpayer dollars and given\nour computer chip shortage are not easy\nto replace in these times moreover\nthere are many police departments in\nGeorgia that do not have backup vehicles\nor if they do they are usually older\nwith outdated equipment\nthat is the bill Mr Speaker and I will\nyield for any questions\nthe lady has yielded for questions and\nyou do you have one from representative\nJasmine Clark to your left\nrepresentative Clark is recognized for a\nquestion\nthank you Mr Speaker does a gentlelady\nyield I do\num I'm curious isn't arson already a\ncrime in Georgia yes it is so what\nexactly is this bill doing that is not\nalready done in the state of Georgia\nwell again as I as I was trying to\nexplain represent Clark because these\nvehicles are increasingly hard to\nreplace and are increasingly more\nexpensive I think it's important that we\nhave a special crime for this because\nthis is taking a car that our that is\nour policeman's primary tool out of\nservice in many counties may only have\ntwo or three patrol cars at their\ndisposal\nand so you're not only just taking a car\nout of service you're taking a tool that\nis protecting people many many people\nout of service\nthank you thank you\nlady has another question if you'll\nyield yes yes I will the gentleman from\nthe 172nd representative Chaz Cannon has\na question to your right thank you Mr\nSpeaker do you yield I do isn't it true\nthat this bill will continue this body's\nmission to better protect the same law\nenforcement officers who protect us each\nand every day absolutely thank you so\nmuch\nis the lady yielding for another\nquestion of course\nrepresenting McCullum is recognized for\na question\nto your left in the back oh here we go\nto yield I do\nisn't

others yes thank you very much\nthank you\nif there are no further questions Mr\nSpeaker I'll yield the well\nyou have a question but you have the\ndiscretion you can do it okay all right\nyou'll take another question yes sir it\nwas about 20 or 30 but you can get\nstarted on them we will join you after\nlunch let's see we'll we'll recognize um\nthe lady from the 142nd represent Paris\nfor a question\nI\nwas just wondering how were you able to\nget a graphic\nof such\nvividness\non the board I've never seen that happen\nbefore\nyou know that I I hadn't I wasn't aware\nof that okay thank you thank you thank\nyou thank you Mr Speaker\nto the ladies Paul we do have\nvisual displays from time to time and\nthat one is pretty vivid so I'm going to\nrecognize the lady from the 142nd\nrepresentative Hughley for a question to\nyour left thank you Mr Speaker does the\ngentlelady yield I do can you give us\nthe how many how often uh this this\ncrime that we're we're making a crime\nhappen how often\ndo we have police cars being set on fire\nby arson in this state how many happened\nlast year you know I don't have those\nstatistics but I've seen plenty on the\nnews\nthank you\nI have two more questions you do if the\nlady in the world will yield to\nrepresentative Wilkerson to your left in\nthe back of the room\nthank you Mr Speaker there's a\ngentlelady yield I do thank you two\nquick questions I I am curious about\nthis is a bicycle considered a vehicle\nin Georgia\nis it what a bicycle considered a\nvehicle in Georgia\nI believe it is yes okay under this bill\nwould that be considered arson of a\nvehicle and punishable by the same\npenalties if you belong this is\nspecifically a law enforcement vehicle\nno law I mean but by law is agility\nfurther yield I do bicycle cops we have\ncops that ride bicycles yes so in this\ncase it would be a police vehicle with\nthis qualifies arson or that vehicle and\nsuffer the same penalties\ntechnically no I don't know that you\ncould burn up a bicycle I can blow up a\nbicycle if you see a 12 year old\nI don't think it has any gas in it to be\nexplosive\n[Music]\nyou have one more question if you'll\nyield for one more certainly German\nPowell to your right chairman Ellen\nPowell thank you Mr Speaker\nI will under your bell is it not true\nthat when someone sets fire deliberately\nsets fire to a police vehicle that's\nalmost synonymous to attacking a police\nofficer\nI would agree\nfor the deal yes is it not also true\nthat this sends a stronger message to\nhave respect for those men and women\nthat are out there enforcing the law\nto protect everybody even those Riders\nbecause when they try to burn a police\nvehicle then they can also damage other\npeople by doing that same not only being\ndisrespectful but they could also put\nother people's lives in danger yes sir I\nthank you for the question thank you\nma'am\nthere are no further questions I'll\nyield the will\nthe lady has yielded the well\nchair will recognize representative\nKennard to speak to the bill\nrepresentative Kennard you have up to 30\nminutes\nshowing opposition to the bill and then\nthere are a few folks who want to speak\nin favor but represent Canada recognized\nthank you Mr Speaker I come to speak to\nHB 500 today to be clear\nif someone torches a law enforcement\nvehicle\nthey have done something seriously wrong\nthey have committed a crime\nit's inexcusable\nand there should be consequences\nif someone commits the act of arson to a\nlaw enforcement vehicle\nthey're dead wrong they've committed a\ncrime\nit's inexcusable and there should be\nconsequences and that's why I love HB\n500.\nthe first page\nlines 1 through 15. I'm in complete\nsupport of it if it was just that I\nwould press the green button\nbut when I turn to page two\nI'm disheartened and I have issue\nbecause lines 16 17 and 18\nit says imprisonment for not less than\nfive years\nthat establishes a mandatory minimum\nthat establishes a mandatory minimum\nmandatory minimum sentencing\nhaven't we learned our lessons with this\nhorrible policy before we've all seen\nthis movie we We Know How It Ends\nI mean this is Draconian measures from\nthe 1980s and 1990s\nhorrible policy that many lawmakers that\nwere involved in that in the 80s and 90s\nnow regret and understand that it\ndecimated communities and created mass\nincarceration policies from the 80s and\nthe 90s what's next are we going to\nbring back mullets and parachute pants\nlisten mullets were just a bad idea I\nknew that because I supported one for\nway too long\nas a matter of fact when I first started\ndating my wife Pam\nfor the first few days I was wearing a\nmullet had been for years after about a\nfew days of our courtship she finally\nsaid you know what\nI like you a lot\nthere's promise in this relationship I'm\nhopeful but the mullet has to go\nand when I look back on pictures now she\nwas absolutely right\nwhat was I thinking when I looked at\nthat picture\nmandatory minimum sentencing is also a\nbad idea what were we thinking when we\nsaw that but again we learned from that\nthat it's bad policy a mentor friend of\nmine who's now deceased he's a pastor I\nworked for him for a number of years in\nColumbus Georgia Pastor Jim swilley\nhe would often tell me Greg there is\nnothing to be learned from the second\nkick of a mule\nshould have learned it the first time\nwe learned through mandatory minimum\nsentencing that it created mass\nincarceration that we're still grappling\nwith now that we're still trying to\nunwind and correct with uh reforms\nthat\nmandatory minimum sentencing created\nmass incarceration at such a level in\nthis country that we skyrocketed our\nincarcerated population to\nworld we topped the world and the people\nwho are incarcerated in our country the\nU.S has four percent of the world's\npopulation but we have 25 percent of the\nworld's prison population which means\nthat one in four incarcerated\nindividuals are so in the United States\nof America the land of the free\nironically\nand guess what among all the 50 states\nin the U.S\nthe state that leads the nation and\npeople who are incarcerated and or under\ncriminal uh Community Supervision does\nanybody want to guess who the U.S leader\nis\nI'll give you a hint it starts with a g\nGeorgia\nan old sweet song\nI can't let uh representative Dexter\nsharper\nhandle all the singing around here\nwell we are so punitive in the state we\nlead the nation\nwe have more people on probation than\nany other state we are four times the\nnational average we have so many\ncriminal records in our gcic system that\nthe gcic staff cannot keep up with its\nmanagement there are 10.7 million people\nin our state there are 4.5 million\nindividuals that have a criminal record\nin 2018 is when I ran for office to be a\npart of this body\nand I was very excited to come down here\nbecause it was on the heels\nof the Nathan Deal era of Criminal\nJustice Reform and I was such a fan that\nwe were now going in the right direction\non these matters\nand and I was so excited to be a part of\nthis body and to work with you on\ncontinuing and building upon the legacy\nof Governor deal and expanding criminal\njustice reforms\nbut to my dismay what I've actually been\ndoing for the last four years now in my\nfifth year is protecting that Legacy is\nfighting for that Legacy defending that\nLegacy because for five years now I have\nseen measure after measure that chips\naway at that Legacy\nthat erodes that Legacy\nwe have done a an about face on Criminal\nJustice Reform and this measure is proof\npositive of that we have separate\nbranches of government for a reason\nour job as legislators is to make laws\nso page one of this bill\nis our lane we Define what a crime is\nbut there's a separate branch that is\nsupposed to meet out punishment and\nconsequences and that are there are\nelected judges the Judiciary Branch they\nare to listen in court to the facts of\nthe case to consider the context to\nparse out the details to weigh all the\nevidence the prosecution the defense and\nafter all that analysis then they meet\nout a consequence or a sentence\nthat fits the Contour of that crime\npage two\nto the domain of the Judiciary\nwe need to stay in our own lane let's\nmake laws but let's not try to handle\nsentencing in this body\nthank you for your time and for these\nreasons I cannot support this bill I\nwould like to I would like to has merits\nthe page two defeats that for me\nthank you Mr Speaker I yield the will\nthe gentleman has yielded the well\nwe have some folks who want to speak in\nfavor of the bill\nrepresentative Daniel is recognized to\nspeak to the bill representative Daniel\nthank you Mr Speaker\nI rise today in support of House Bill\n500. I know how riots can impact all\nsmall businesses but even more\nimportantly minority and\nunderrepresented communities not just in\nAtlanta but all over our state like mine\nI'm supporting this legislation because\nunderrepresented people and districts\njust like the one that I represent\ndeserve the same opportunity to benefit\nfrom Public Safety just as much as the\nrest of the state\nthis has not necessarily been true in\nrecent times\nas we have witnessed individuals from\noutside of Georgia and citing violence\nduring what otherwise would have been\npeaceful and at times needed\ndemonstrations it is essential to\nemphasize that those who come from other\nstates to cause trouble will face\nconsequences if they choose to misdirect\nthe attention from the important matters\nat hand\nby attempting to burn a law enforcement\nvehicle we are creating a sense of panic\nin our state they will be subject to\njust penalties for the damage and crimes\nthat they commit if they do such a crime\nthrough this through this bill we intend\nto demonstrate our unwavering support\nand appreciation for the law enforcement\nofficials who Safeguard our small\nbusinesses and communities during\nviolent times\nand I emphasize again violent riots we\nwill always welcome peaceful\ndemonstrations and protect them because\nthey are so vital to our thriving\nrepresentative democracy we will not\ncondone violent actions that ultimately\ndisaffect underrepresented communities\nand every taxpayer in the state of\nGeorgia I ask for your favorable\nconsideration of House Bill 500 and I\nyelled the wealth\nlady has yielded The Well of\nRepresentative Crowe\npresented Crowe is recognized to speak\nto the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker ladies and\ngentlemen I'll be fairly brief hopefully\nthe day is long and lunchtime is near\num I stand here to support House Bill\n500 many things have been said already\nso I don't want to repeat a lot of\nwhat's been said the one thing that I\ndid want to point out are a couple of\nthings I wanted to point out though\num\narson of a law enforcement vehicle is\nnot just destructive it's not just\ndangerous\nbut it's an assault on Law and Order\nitself\nthese men and women in law enforcement\nand the institutions of law enforcement\nagencies\nare out there to go out and enforce the\nlaws that we pass in this very chamber\nand they are our Representatives that go\nout and actually enforce the laws that\nwe make in this building and when you\nburn one of the vehicles it's an assault\non Law and Order all across the state\nand to Mr Kennards point or\nrepresentative kenner's point I did want\nto address that real quick I agree with\nyou I'm a fan of Page one as well page\ntwo though as far as a mandatory minimum\non line 17\nit says that it shall be punished by a\nfine of not more than a hundred thousand\ndollars or\nby imprisonment for not less than five\nyears nor more than 20 years or both\nso the judge doesn't have to sentence\nanybody to jail they can simply issue a\nfine if the judge's discretion causes\nthem to want to do that so but ladies\nand gentlemen there are a lot of things\nthat that can be charged in multiple\nways this is a a clear statement to\nthose that want to come here and and\nviolate our law and damage our streets\nand damage our businesses and burn our\npolice cars that we are going to support\nlaw and order in this state and we're\ngoing to support the men and women who\ngo out and enforce that Law and Order\nand enforce the laws that we create in\nthis chamber thank you I yield the will\nthe gentleman has yielded the well\nthat's all of our speakers on this issue\nso let's see not quite all of them but\nis there any objection to the previous\nquestion being ordered a chair has done\nthe previous question is ordered so now\nwe'll move on to chairs Chairman's time\nwe have 20 minutes allocated for\nChairman's time\nchairman Jay Collins is recognized to\nspeak to the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker once again I'm\ngoing to be brief with my comments\nthe fact where he even had to stand here\nand talk about this\nis is an issue within itself\nbut I want to I want to submit to you\nhere today ladies and gentlemen\nlook at that photograph right there\nand I challenge you each and every time\nyou see a peace officer driving the\npatrol car\nmore often than not you'll see the\nwinners are tended\nimagine what happens when someone is\nattacking that car\nbut doesn't know that there's somebody\nin custody in handcuffs in the back of\nthat car\nthink about that for a minute\nagain\nthe number one priority for government\nis to protect persons and property\nand ladies and gentlemen you can't do\nthat if you don't have a flute of\nvehicles\nwe have seen what these paid protesters\npaid Riders are doing throughout our\ncountry throughout this state\nmajority of these people are not our\nhomegrown folks they're people that are\ncoming in here from other states\neven other countries and that's another\nissue would need to be debating sometime\nmaybe up a little above higher above the\npay grade than what we are here but I\nsubmit to you ladies and gentlemen\nthe fact that we have to discuss this is\nan issue within itself and we need to\nsend a clear and strong message that\nwe're not going to tolerate this\nBehavior here in the state of Georgia\nthat's all I have to say Mr Speaker I\ngladly yield the Chairman's time to my\ngood friend Houston Gaines\nthe gentleman has yielded the well\nrepresentative Gaines is recognized to\nspeak to the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker and thank you Mr\nchairman I want to thank\nchairman silcox for her leadership on\nthis bill and bringing this before the\nbody\nand as chairman Collins said it's it's\nfrankly uh concerning that we even have\nto discuss this the pictures that we've\nseen\nthis is and just didn't happen just a\ncouple years ago you know we I think\nmany of us in this room were hoping that\nwhen the defund the police movement\nhappened it was short-lived it wasn't\nsomething we'd continue to see year\nafter year but that sentiment is still\naround and it's something we still\nhave to address and I think this\nlegislation sends a very important\nsignal that individuals who want to go\nafter our Law Enforcement Officers will\nbe punished they'll be put behind bars\nhere in Georgia we're going to hold\ncriminals accountable those individuals\nare not welcome in our state who are\ntrying to go after our law enforcement\nofficers and I just again want to thank\nchairman silcox\nfor bringing this bill before us of\ncourse we support peaceful protests in\nGeorgia and have a long history of doing\nso but individuals who go and put police\ncars on fire and we saw that just a\ncouple couple weeks ago in a couple\nweeks ago in January we had a front page\nof the Atlanta paper we had a police car\nthat was set on fire it's an\nembarrassment to our state that's why we\nneed to put it into it and I believe\nthis legislation is a strong signal that\nwe will not welcome individuals who are\ngoing to put police cars on fires and\nriot in the streets and put individuals\nin individual lives in danger in Georgia\nand so again thank you chairman silcox\nfor your leadership chairman Collins and\nI'd ask for this body's favorable\nconsideration of house bill 500.\nthat completes our debate on the bill\nis there an objection to agreeing to the\nreport of the committee which was\nfavorable to the passage of the bill\nchair hears none the report of the\ncommittee has agreed to\nshall this bill now pass all in favor of\nthe passage of the bill will vote Yes\nall those opposed will vote no and the\nclerk will unlock\nthe machine\nfor what

law enforcement\nbody in this state\nwe also understand that we have laws\nalready on the books like felony\ncriminal damage to property\n16-7-23 ocga that is already available\nto make sure that these penalties are\naddressed but that we also\nfurther do appreciate\nfrom hearing from Republicans our\ncolleagues here\nthat they do not appreciate\nthe expensive destruction of a capital\nincluding Atlanta as well as the\nnation's capital on January 6th\nI'm sure the gentleman believes what he\nso speaks he's kind of hit it off in a\ndifferent direction\nso for what purpose does representative\nReese\nrise\nparliamentary inquiry Mr Speaker the\nstate you inquiry Mr Speaker isn't it\ntrue that the D.A of Atlanta was able to\nfound charges to charge the individuals\nthat committed the horrific crime of the\npicture that we saw on the screen and\nthat this same D.A will be in charge of\napplying this law if it was to pass and\nthat you would have to ask yourself is\nthis law even necessary if we found laws\nto charge them with from the initial\ncrime that has been incited in this body\nby this picture that was on the screen\nthat's good when I think yeah I know\nthat a gentleman believes everything he\njust said and I'm not sure how what the\nD.A charged so I'll have to admit that\nfor what purposes representative Miller\nrise thank you Mr Speaker

House Bill 130 is\nGovernor Kemp's administrative\ninitiative the Georgia peace officers\nservice loan repayment program the\npurpose of this program is to recruit\nand retain Public Law Enforcement\nOfficers across the state of Georgia\ncurrently according to the Georgia\nSheriff's Association and the police\nChiefs Association we are somewhere\naround four to five thousand police\nofficers peace officers short in the\nstate of Georgia this legislation builds\nupon what we did as a legislature last\nyear by adding criminal justice degrees\nto high the high demand career\ninitiative to be eligible for the Hope\ncareer Grant\nlaw enforcement officers are critical to\nprotecting the citizens of this state\nbut are often faced with a decision\nbetween heeding the call to public\nservice or seeking other opportunities\nto pay student loans\nto ensure that we're retaining top\ntalent we are looking to implement and\ninvest 3.2 million dollars in a loan\nrepayment plan for state and local law\nenforcement this plan funds up to 800\nofficers and will provide a loan\nrepayment of up to twenty thousand\ndollars per officer in exchange for five\nyears of service so if you are a new\nofficer coming in and you have student\nloans from a course of study in any area\nyou are eligible as of January of one of\nthis year to participate in this program\nand to receive up to twenty thousand\ndollars in loan forgiveness for coming\ninto law enforcement and working five\nyears if you are an existing law\nenforcement officer and you decide

Enforcement\nOfficers can\num get loans repaid\nthrough this through this program is\nthat correct that is correct that's\ngentleman further you I yield all right\nso after thinking about that doesn't\nthat basically say that they just have\nto take out a loan in order for us to\npay off the loan that we're making them\ntake out so we're not actually paying\noff current officers on loans instead\nwe're basically just paying them to go\nto school if they want to that is\ncorrect that is the difference between\nthe individual that would be coming in\nas of January 1 of this year or

this\nbill in any way weaken local rule by\nshifting current responsibilities or\ndiscretion held at the local level to\nthis newly formed State office no it\nessentially shifts uh ftes from doe over\nto State Charter School commission to\nmake them more responsive to our local\nauthorizers so it no way impacts the the\nlocals thank you representative thank\nyou chair recognizes

using administratively it goes back\nto the charter school and how much do\nyou think Charter Schools will realize\nas a result of the change it's a great\nquestion so you'll notice in the bill\ncurrently in statute what happens is\nCharter Schools pay a three percent\nadministrative fee to the locals uh the\nlocals best example I'll give you\nimagine if you're in your paycheck\nsomeone took three percent and you had\nno detail on what that was spent on what\nit's currently supposed to be spent on\nis Administrative Services supporting\nthe local charter school this bill\nprovides when that three percent is\ntaken out to then have the locals\nprovide detail on what exactly that\nthree percent was spent on any unspent\nportion will be returned to the Charter\nSchool\nchair recognizes representative Williams\nfrom the 37th for a question\nMadam speaker\nwill the gentleman yield yes ma'am so\nthe city of Marietta our whole school\nsystem is a charter school system so\nI've heard you answer questions but\ncould you walk me through how this is\ngoing to change\nthe operation and funding of city of\nMarietta schools\nso I don't believe the bill addresses\ncharter school systems this is strictly\nCharter Schools uh so and again no\nchange in operations or funding it\nessentially it provides a resource that\nwas formally housed in doe now housed up\nin the state Charter School commission\nuh to provide further support for your\nlocal Charter Schools\num Matt follow-up question\nstage a question\num do you have the endorsement of the\nstate school superintendent for this\nbill\nwe have worked with uh doe and a number\nof state agencies and local school\nboards on this bill\nso\num does the they have does he does the\nstate superintendent endorse this bill\nthey have not uh\nformulator given us an opinion one way\nor the other okay thank you\nchair recognizes representative Clark of\nthe 108th for a question\nthank you madam speaker does a gentleman\nyield yes ma'am can you uh talk a little\nbit more about what's happening in lines\n197 through 203 specifically when it\ncomes to requiring that the charter\nschools be funded but also allowing\nthose charter schools to exceed their\nenrollment caps\nyeah so currently\nwhat takes place at a charter school is\nthat they're able to\nthey have a charter school contract\nwhich stipulates how many students are\nable to to Service uh this bill allows\nfor a very small overage if they are\nover they do not receive any additional\nfunding for that overage uh and it's a\nvery small percent we're talking about\non average probably three to five\nstudents so a typical School estimate We\nBelieve will have X number uh obviously\nwith with any business of what we do we\ntry to get exact but uh you're always\ngoing to be off by maybe one or two\nstudents and that's what this bill\nprovides for does the gentleman further\nyield yes ma'am so you say it doesn't\nrequire but it says that the local board\nshall provide the funding and that they\nshall not be deemed to have exceeded the\nenrollment cap so wouldn't that mean\nthey shall fund the extra\nno there's no additional funding for the\nextra kids that they go over uh all\nthose terms are stipulated in their\nCharter School contract thank you\nchair recognizes representative Campbell\nfor a question to your left\nthank you madam speaker does the\ngentleman yield yes ma'am a bit of a\nfollow-up question but I'm curious to\nknow uh did you in the work and\norganizing of this meet and confer with\nthe Georgia School Board Association and\ndo they support this bill\nyes met with them again all those\norganizations uh\nI don't want to speak out of turn\nneither one of them have come out\nnegatively or in favor but all of them\nhad input into the language of this bill\nchair recognizes representative Carter\nfor a question\nthank you madam speaker does the\ngentleman yield yes ma'am there she is\nthank you on line 210 to 2 14 and this\nwas one of the issues that the\ndepartment the doe brought up that in\ncreating a state school commission the\nPersonnel for that commission will now\nbe assigned under the school board the\nstate school board versus the doe can\nyou help us understand how that's going\nto functionally work and\num what really is changing because if\nyou're creating the uh the office of\nflexibility you're creating this\ncommission it's supposed to help the\ncharter schools for the locals but there\nis a parameter in which that that will\nthat is something different there's\nsomething other than just Personnel that\nchanged out of this purse why isn't it\nunder the school superintendent versus\nthe doe and what really is happening in\nthis building why is there a change\ngreat question so uh if I could help you\nall visualize kind of an org chart right\nhere so uh right over here you have the\ndoe which then it reports up through the\nState Board of Education we are taking\nadministrative staff from doe shifting\nthem over to the state Charter School\ncommission which is administratively\nattached to the State Board of Education\nso if you all can kind of visualize two\nboxes two lines up to State Board of\nEducation shifting administrative staff\nfrom one to the other to better be\nresponsive to our local governments\nand there are no more

approved in the state of\nGeorgia so on any new construction\nwhether a home or commercial real estate\nthis product would not be available to\nbe installed so we want to make sure\nthat that's okay

are the repercussions for people\nwho own existing air conditioning\nsystems and\ndo they have to buy the new refrigerant\nor would they have to buy new equipment\nthat uses the new refrigerant what what\nare the repercussions if we don't pass\nthis bill well it's two pieces to that\nso one as long as the current\nrefrigerants available which it it will\nbe there's a transition time frame that\nthis will occur so there's R22 or r410\ncurrently that's used so if the entire\npiece of equipment goes out it will need\nto be replaced and if that is not\navailable by manufacturers then you will\num\nwe'll call it Dippity Doo\nand that is when you wake up in the\nmorning\nand you go\nand you look down and there's\nwell never mind it has to do with never\nmind forgive me go ahead\nchair

process of purchasing a new cooler\nfor my business\nyes okay if you say so\nyes that is true so can you explain to\nme exactly how this bill is going to\nimpact my plans to purchase a new cooler\nfor my business\nso it's based on refrigerant what\nrefrigerant you have in the existing or\nthe new cooler there is a new\nrequirement for refrigerant on future\nmanufactured product\nso as long as this does not go bad with\nthe old refrigerant then you'll be fine\nbut moving forward if something were to\ngo wrong then you would need to replace\nthe equipment with new HVAC or a new\nrefrigerant\nbut if I go if is it not further true\nthat if I purchase my new cooler now\nthat I won't I'll be good with your bill\nI mean it won't be any issues you will\nbe fine okay which is important in

you House Bill\n338 which is the student technology\nprotection act that this act provides\nmethods of promoting the safe and\nappropriate use of technology and\nresponsible digital citizenship\nso it is filtering of obscene material\nfrom state-owned devices we passed this\nbill last year overwhelmingly out of\nthis house and got it over to the Senate\nwhat we are attempting to do here is to\num make sure that that Predators aren't\nable to get on the devices that we are\nhanding our children as well as\ninappropriate or not grade appropriate\nmaterial is not able to be accessed\nthrough the devices that our children\ncarry home with them covid really spiked\nthis up as you could imagine we gave\nmany more devices for children to carry\nhome to use to learn from\nthe there is a simple law out there\nwhich is the federal act that has set\nstandards for uh filtering\num what we try what we're supposed to do\nto keep that inappropriate material\num all fire devices what we have done\nhere is we have measured those\num they had not been updated the sipa\nlaw since 2011.\nso there's a need in the state of\nGeorgia to make sure that we not only\nlet a sipa law from 2011 govern the\nprotection of our children but also the\nfact that Georgia needs to be protecting\nour children so with that Madam speaker\nI will yield for questions\nchair recognizes representative\ninulowitz for a question to your left\nthank you to the gentleman yield yes I\ndo is it not true that children will\nhave access to these kinds of very\ndisturbing materials whether or not\nthey're on a school computer\nor device but but if they have their own\ndevice that the answer that is correct\ntheir own device but not a state held\ndevice does the gentleman further yield\nI do is it not also true that because of\nthat because these devices are really\nkind of ubiquitous regardless of whether\nor not your child has access to a device\nthrough school or through home it's very\nimportant for parents to have these\nconversations with their children to\nprepare them for things they might see\nand to explain what these things are and\nwhy it's and that it's important for\nparents to understand why they need to\nhave these conversations earlier than\nthey probably think they need to I will\nagree that parents definitely need to be\nhaving conversations with their children\non what's right and what's wrong thank\nyou\nchair recognizes representative Barnes\nfor a question\nthank you chair lady does the gentleman\nyield yes ma'am I do thank you is it\nwill this bill also\nblock them from being able to access\nthese sites from different uh devices\nlike will it block the Wi-Fi so if they\nuse their personal device in the school\nwell the Wi-Fi be able to block them\nfrom accessing these sites let me see if\nI understand the question there are\nfilters that there are servers that have\nfilters on them at the state facilities\ncurrently today and they will block uh\ninappropriate or not grade appropriate\nat school but also the devices that they\ncarry home such as hot spots they need\nthose same filters on those hot spots\nmay I further\nyield does a gentleman further yield I\ndo thank you\nso when they're at home and they have\nthe school issued device they will not\nbe allowed to access these sites at home\nas well if it's a hot spot it is\nfiltered and they would not be able to\nthat does not stop them to be on their\nown uh internet their own personally\npaid devices it would only be these\nstate-owned devices if they are trying\nto access through it thank you yes ma'am\nchair recognizes representative awe for\nquestion\nthank you does the gentleman yield well\nif I can find you I'm here I'm here\nthere we go two years representative I'm\nsure this is a question regarding the\ndefinition of obscene materials if you\nrefer to your copy of the bill lines 89\nthrough 91\nhow that reads is that obscene materials\nis defined as quote predominantly\nappeals to the period interest that is a\nshameful or morbid interest in nudity\nsex or excretion so I'm asking this\nlooking through the lens of someone\nwho's watching some fairly alarming\nbills who uh that are passing through\nthe Senate side that look to legislate\nthe upbringing and education of our\nlgbtq youth so I'm aware that some of\nthe folks bringing some of the\nanti-lgbtq bills might in fact look at\nsome of the literature or medical\ninformation or social support for these\nstudents as quote shameful or as quote\nmorbid interest in nudity that type of\nthing so can you can you give me any\nassurances that this bill excludes\nthat type of literature or information\nor online social support for these\nstudents or would such materials be in\nfact deemed obscene under this bill\nrepresentative these definitions and the\ndefinition obscenity came straight out\nof the code section in the law books and\nthat's what is put in here\nin this bill so can you give me any\nassurance that this does not preclude\nchildren who might have only one device\nas issued through the school from\naccessing\naccurate medical information or social\nsupport through these devices this does\nnot preclude that we talk about this\nit's grade appropriate so it would be\ndifferent for a 11th grader or an eighth\ngrader versus a first grader to access\nmaterial through here so we try to uh in\neverything we do in schools we try to\nmake it great appropriate the same thing\ncan be said for surgeries and some uh\nvideos on surgeries whether that's a\ngrade appropriate or not and a senior\nwould be allowed to access that\ninformation if it was appropriate say\nfor a med student that wants to be\npre-med in college versus a second\ngrader so this would attempt to be great\nappropriate material if it's great\nappropriate for a senior then it would\nnot filter that out certainly I think\nthere's just some subjectivity in that\nthank you for answering my questions yes\nthere are no more questions\nwe would ask your favorable\nconsideration for this bill to get it\nmoving again this year and also uh we we\nwill then yield the will\nthat gentleman has yielded the well is\nthere any objection to the previous\nquestion being ordered the chair here is\nnine the previous question is ordered is\nthere any objection to adopting

post-secondary education\nprograms which are programs at\nuniversities and colleges throughout\nGeorgia that allow students with\nintellectual disabilities the\nopportunity to attend college when I

honored\nto have the opportunity to work on this\ngame-changing issue in the state\nSenator Gooch and I co-chaired a joint\nstudy committee this year\nhad some great committee members\nchairman Powell\nchairman Parsons chairman Corbett we\nadded a couple of people representative\nBrad Thomas and representative Spencer\nFrye\nto help us we created a 700 page\ndocument they'll be glad to send you\nbecause the the issue is Giant and and\nwide-ranging you know I have to\nrecognize Catherine Russell who was in\nthe Senate research office at the time\nnow works the department of AG for\nreally putting that together and from\nhouse budget and research Abby day\nyou know due to the Biden\nadministration's focus on electric\nvehicles\nmanufacturers have invested\nin electric vehicles in a great way\nyou'll look at our state you look at the\nannouncements by the governor as it\nrelates to electric vehicles you know\nwe're the leader\nand the federal funding\nof the Navy plan which is the national\nelectric vehicle infrastructure plan\nwill put Chargers across this state in a\ngreat way\nGeorgia itself will receive 125 million\ndollars over the next five years 25\nmillion dollars this year\nand for for plan year one which has been\napproved by usdot and is certainly\nunderway right now\nso knowing all this was at our doorstep\nthat's what we had this meeting to act\nyou know so our goal is to ensure that\nGeorgia roads and bridges were\nadequately funded\nand that meant the collection of excise\ntax on the sale of electricity for fuel\njust like gasoline is right now\nthis is Cutting Edge you know as we\nworked on this you know we are the\nleaders as we generally are on\nTransportation issues in America\nit's built us three things\nit allows for the retail sale of\nelectricity\nby others than Georgia power or their\nemcs\nit creates a regulatory framework for\nelectric vehicle chargers for safety\naccuracy and the location of them to\nmake sure that we\nget our excise tax dollars that's my\nnumber one goal\nand then we also create the excise tax\non electricity\nat 16 Pages you have to thank Jenna\ndoley in legislative Council and uh it's\nalso Madison in my office who's dealt\nwith the incessant number of people in\nmy office to work on this bill because\nthis touches just about everybody across\nthe state you look at part one page two\nprobably the most important part of the\nbill because this language allows the\nowners of electric vehicle charging\nequipment to sell electricity by the\nkilowatt hour\nfor the sole purpose of charging an\nelectric vehicle\nthis language represents a very\ncarefully crafted compromise between all\nparties that were negotiated last year\non chairman Powell's bill\nand this also reflects the findings of\nthe commission on the electric case of\nTransportation I certainly want to thank\nchairman Powell and chairman Parsons for\nworking on this agreement\npart two page three all the way through\nlines 222\nis original gasoline code\nbut so what we did is we took how we\nregulate fuels today how it's sold\nstored everything\nand carefully worded it legislative\nCouncil make it fit the use of\nelectricity\non Section 3 page 10 is the tax\nregulations part of it worked very\ncarefully with the Department of Revenue\non this section to make sure we\naccurately\ncaptured energy used in transportation\nand electricity compressed air\nliquefied natural gas and even the\nfuture looking hydrogen\nand section four are the effective dates\nand if you look they're out their ways\nbecause we've got to give an opportunity\nfor the target of act to scale up for\nRevenue to scale up and for the charging\nstation providers to make sure that they\ncan do what we're going to ask them to\ndo\nMr Speaker I appreciate the opportunity\nto work on work on this bill and I'll be\nglad to answer any questions\nwell I got a second you got something on\nyour desk\nfrom the Georgia Georgia Chamber but I\nwant to put a shout out to the Georgia\nTransportation Alliance if you haven't\nworked when you will in the future work\nwith Seth Milliken and his group they\nare great advocates for

reduce their payload\nby 15 000 or weight limits will have to\nbe addressed\nhey\nthe gentleman is absolutely correct and\num\nthat's why you know Karen Meeks we added\nhydrogen because hydrogen will probably\nbe the fuel of choice for heavy\nequipment and tractor moving\nrepresentative Tran is recognized for a\nquestion\nthank you Mr Speaker that's the chairman\nyield yes sir\nis it true that this does not apply\nthere will not be a tax on vehicles\ncharged at home oh absolutely thank you\nfor pointing that out you know currently\na vehicle is charged at home is uh pays\na fee it's a 210 dollars and a few cents\nper year so we're not touching that\nthey'll be able to still charge at home\nand take advantage of opportunities that\nsome emcs in Georgia Power May provide\nfor charging in

selling\nthe retail sale of electricity by the\nkilowatt hour and there are some other\nissues in that too that I think are\ngoing to be looked at and hopefully\nthere's some some communication some\nconversation about that right now I'd\nalso like to mention chairman chokos I\ndon't know if he's back there or not\nchairman showcas had a bill on\nthere he is he had a bill on the same\nissue last year and he put in a lot of\nwork on it and he had a bill also and\nthis the same issue as far as the retail\nsale of electricity by the kilowatt hour\nuh that uh he put in work on that and\nbasically came up with the same the same\nlanguage so I want to thank him for that\nand uh with that I would just say that\nwe were our committee did some hard work\non that listening to a lot I

many of his\nmembers you know we got into the mix on\nthis last year that we knew that this\nwas coming in as elono the uh the powers\nthat be in the federal government and\nthe public policies of this country are\nchanging\nand I realized at that point we had such\nan intricate part in uh that we're going\nthere's going to be at stake we had uh\nthe MC's we had Georgia power and we\nknow we all understand business in this\nstate we understand it's about winners\nand losers and all of these different\nentities they were salivating at the\nlips who was going to try to get a\nmonopoly as best they could or get over\non the other one and so it's picking\nwinners and losers\nthanks to\nchairman Parson and his committee\nmembers it was bipartisan about some of\nthe things that we talked about was to\nprohibit monopolies to do things like\nthe sale of Power by the KW\nbecause you're fixing to see a change of\nthis country\nas this idea about electric vehicles\nmoves forward and I had said last year I\nhad some concerns being an old\nconvenience store guy in our earlier\nlife I see the I see things that are\ngoing to change with this EV but EV is\nnot going to be the final solution it's\nonly going to be part of the part of the\nsolution to our energy problems in the\nfuture I personally think that it's\ngoing to be minor I think right now that\neverything that we've seen is uh with\nall the federal grants and all the money\nand all the people who want to get into\nthe charging business and I suspect at\nsome point you're going to be riding\ndown the highway the way I have in my\npast and you're going to see these\npopsicle sticks spread across the\nHorizon of this great state and Country\nand it's going to be EV charges that are\nobsolete because I have feel full faith\nin the research and development of a lot\nof companies whether it's hydrogen or\ncompressed this or compress that or\npropane and you know you're going to see\nother forms of energy that are going to\nuh that are going to be powering this\nnation but you can rest assured on one\nthing\nthat it's going to change the makeup\na lot of those stores that rely on\ngasoline products today they're gonna a\nlot of them are gonna have to retool\nthey're going to have to figure out\nother sources of revenue they're going\nto have to figure out food service\nthey're going to figure out shopping or\nwhatever because the American public is\nnot in our nature to go and sit on our\nfannies for 30 minutes while you get a\ncharge to get on down the road another\n150 miles\nthat's just not the nature of this\ncountry I just don't believe it will be\nin the future\nbut that being said I want to commend\nand we've all given him a round of\napplause and I think that's very fitting\nbecause he put in a yeoman's job on this\ncommittee this year we traveled around\nbits and parts of the state and we did\nall this stuff but the openness of the\nmind and he kept focused on\nthe bottom line to this and the bottom\nline was how do we how do we change the\nformulary for motor fuel tax to kilowatt\nhours\nI'm not sure it's all going to work but\nI know it's a step forward in this\npretty revolutionary and where we're\ngoing and I think he needs to be given\nall full credit for that and all the\nmembers of the committee that weighed in\non this so ladies and gentlemen of the\nhouse I would certainly commend you to\nvote for this bill\nif nothing else that board should\nprobably be the greenest board that I've\nseen since this morning I laughed to\nmyself I told Donna the door keeper I\nlooked up at the board this morning and\nI saw\nthe greenest board I'd ever seen this\ntime\nI mean hardly nobody was missing on\nwhatever that issue was but that's what\nthis bill is this is a bill and step in\nthe right direction it's built to get us\nprepared for the future and I would\ncertainly recommend you vote for this\nBill thank you\nthe gentleman has yielded the well\nrepresenting Brad Thomas is recognized\nto speak to the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker I'll make sure to\nkeep this short I was proud to serve on\nthe Joint Committee for electrification\ntransportation I actually didn't make\nthe first cut of the committee my fine\nchairman over here actually helped me\nget onto the committee and I'll I'll be\nvery I'm very grateful for that and I\nrise in support of HB 406 this bill it\ncodifies sound and practical policies\nfor fuels of Tomorrow specifically\nelectricity hydrogen and some other\nalternative fuels you know it's our it's\nour responsibility to provide an economy\nthat allows for all fuel sources to be\nmade available and let the consumer\ndecide what's best for them\nuh I I actually drive a four-wheel drive\ntruck every day\num I got a 68 Camaro I take out on the\nweekends when when it's sunny\nand uh I'm not what the EV industry\nwould identify as like a likely customer\nbut my job isn't here to protect my fuel\nsource my job here is to allow for the\nfree market system to operate and allow\nfor people to have the choice of fuel\nand this bill does that\nuh one thing people don't realize is\nelectric cars can be powered not only by\nthe power stored in their battery but\nthrough hydrogen via hydrogen fuel cell\ntechnology\nthis bill addresses fuel diversity and\nlays ground work for future alternative\nfuels\nI believe our roads are for the use of\neveryone\nbut I also believe that everyone should\npay their fair share this bill addresses\nthat\nfinally I believe that the consumer\nshould be protected from Bad actors who\nmay not be providing the charging power\nthat that they're saying that they're\nactually charging this bill addresses\nthat\nso I once again once again commend\nchairman Jaspers like I said the one\nthing you'll know it says joint\ncommittee that means he had to work with\nSenators I feel like he deserves another\nwhole Applause for that\nbut otherwise I asked for your favorable\nconsideration and I yield well\nthe gentleman has yielded the well is\nthere any objection to the previous\nquestion being ordered the chair here\nhas done the
