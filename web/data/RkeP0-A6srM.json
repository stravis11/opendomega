legislation if\nyou don't want to hear it take it to one\nof those other places or out the front\ndoor representive boner is recognized to\nspeak to sb1 representative\nboner thank you Mr\nSpeaker colleagues I rise today to\npresent Senate bill\none Senate bill one represents years of\nwork by members of this house and the\nSenate intense scrutiny by Senate study\ncommittee led by Senator dolal and hours\nof testimony and debate in both Chambers\nit is a narrowly tailored Common Sense\nbill that achieves the goal of\nmaintaining fairness in female Athletics\nby eliminating the potential for male\nadvantage and protects female spaces\nduring Sports reporting events Senate\nBill 1 incorporates many of the\nprovisions of House Bill 267 we passed\njust a few weeks ago and Mr Speaker I\nwill keep my presentation brief by\nhighlighting just a few of the\nsimilarities and\ndifferences first Senate bill incorp\nSenate bill one incorporates the naming\nconvention we adopted with the title of\nthe Riley gains act in fact we\nentertained briefly changing the name to\nthe Gavin Nome act following the\ngovernor of California recent support of\nkeeping biological males out of girls\nSports the bill includes a more\ncomprehensive definition of sleeping\nquarters found on lines 86 through\n89 and then Senate bill one removes the\nlanguage regarding birth certificates\nbut maintains the language we adopted\nregarding medical record reviews and\nstandard School medical procedures\nadditionally Senate bill one\nincorporates the house caveats regarding\nthose authorized to be in the locker\nrooms restrooms and changing\nareas in House Bill 267 we established\nthe Professional Standards Commission as\nthe firstline Arbiter of complaints and\ninvestigations Senate bill one relies\ninstead on an existing complaint\nstandard currently in Ed today and\nincludes a number of appellate deadlines\nthe private cause of action Remains the\nSame for both bills the most significant\ndifference in the bill is that Senate\nbill one does not include any of the\ncode revision language found counted\nHouse Bill\n267 and represents a bill solely focused\non female Athletics colleagues the bill\nbefore us today provides an opportunity\nto provide a Level Playing Field and\nensure Fair competition for female\nathletes in Georgia with that Mr Speaker\nthat is the bill and I would be happy to\nstand for any\nquestions gentleman has a couple of\nquestions and then we have speakers on\nthe bill uh I recognize representative\nran to your left up of the center four\nquestion thank you Mr Speaker does the\ngentleman yield I do thank you so um\nwe've been talking a lot about this\nissue over the past uh duration of the\nsession how many um trans athletes are\nthere in the state of Georgia I I do not\nhave that information got it and um do\nyou further yield I do thank you so um\nyou know we have talked a lot about\ncertain athletes particularly those that\nhave come down to Lobby on bills like\nthis from my understanding that athlete\ndid in fact tie with her trans\ncounterpart cuz there are frankly very\nfew trans athletes and they're not you\nknow very great um I mean they're\nthey're great for their division but not\nnecessarily better than their\ncounterparts so when we talk about like\nprotecting girls Sports why was there\nnot more of a focus on things like\nathletic facilities making sure they\nhave um Equitable access to coaches and\nthings like that well that's certainly\nan issue that I'm certainly concerned\nwith and look forward to working with\nyou in the future on a bill that\naddresses just that do you yield for one\nmore question no okay got it thank you\nMr\nSpeaker gentem has a couple other\nquestions representative rice to your\nleft is recognized for to your left Mr\nchairman is recognized for a question\nthank you Mr Speaker does a gentlemen\nwhat you I do is it not true that for\npreserving distinct male and female\nsports teams this bill protects the\nopportunities scholarships and the\nsafety of female student athletes across\nGeorgia absolutely thank you for the\nquestion and I think this bill uh\ndirectly uh speaks to the title n\nprotections that were so\nhardfought gentleman you off for another\nquestion representative fry yes to your\nleft up front is recognized for a\nquestion gentleman\nrecognized thank you Mr Speaker\ngentleman yield to my friend I do thank\nyou my\nfriend this isn't an antagonist of\nquestion but isn't it true that Riley\nGaines came in fifth place yeah fifth\nplace was defeated by four other women\nand she was upset she didn't get a\nparticipation trophy by Hing for\nfifth isn't that\ntrue I won't dispute the um I know that\nshe won some other competitions um I do\nknow that she may have placed in a\ndifferent um in fifth as you say but\nhere's how I would address that though\nis that this is not a one for one so\nit's not as if a a biological male that\nwins a competition against a biological\nfemale it's not a one for one swap so um\nthat biological male knocking one female\nout of a top spot spot in fact shifts\neverybody down and pushes many many\nfemales down the line out of those uh\nout of competition for medals uh for\ntitles and things like that\nso representative Corbett to your\nright is recogniz for a question thank\nyou Mr Speaker this gentleman y I do is\nit not true that women's sports are not\na backup option for media ochre male\nathletes I would completely agree thank\nyou for the question\nI'll stand for one more Mr\nSpeaker okay uh let's see now you have\nyou have a couple more uh representative\ngullet had his light on light on so I'll\ngo by that representative gullet is\nrecognized for a question thank you jman\nyield I do isn't it true that this bill\njust really enfor reinforces that female\nathletes have a fair and safe athletic\num environment to play in absolutely all\nwe're looking for is simply a Level\nPlaying Field meaning when a female\nathlete steps on the playing field that\nthere is no Advantage other than fair\nand clean competition so with that Mr\nSpeaker I was certainly yielded well I\nencourage my colleagues the yes vote I\nwould also uh Mr Speaker just take a\nmoment to thank all those that have had\na part in this this has been a\nmulti-year effort by a number of house\nmembers and Senators I'd like to thank\nSenator dolal lieutenant governor Jones\nchairman Chris Irwin and his committee U\nfor helping guide this and then lastly\nyou speaker Burns for your leadership on\nthis issue and providing a play a a\nLevel Playing Field for female athletes\nin Georgia and with that I'd ask your\nfavorable consideration gentleman\nyielded the well okay here's our posture\nwe have a number of folks that are\ninterested in on speaking to the bill we\nhave chair's time and Minority Report as\nwell so I'm going to give up to 40\nminutes to those opposed and those in\nfavor of the bill that will be allocated\nto speakers will allocate their time up\nto 40 minutes and we will begin our\ndiscussion on those opposed to sb1 by\nrecognizing representative\nLupton give the lady and you well your\nattention representative Karen lton is\nrecognized to speak to the Bill thank\nthank you Mr Speaker come on folks do I\nhave to come down and speak about this\nagain okay you don't want to hear it I\ndon't want to have to say it but here we\ngo I've been called upon this is my\njob um I sit on the education committee\nwhere sb1 came through and where the uh\ncomparable HB bill came through um I've\nheard people speak to it I've heard\npeople speak against\nit and I especially in this last um in\nthis last committee\nmeeting I really noticed something very\ndistinct about who was speaking for and\nwho was speaking against\nsb1 now if this is such common sense if\nthis is so needed if this is a\nshield for girls in sports you'd think\nthat there'd be lots of\ncoaches lots of schools that run Sports\nprograms\ns lots of\nathletes coming up storming the castle\nand saying oh my gosh we need this\nnow and\ninstead the people who spoke to the bill\nwere athletes who are currently\ncompeting with and against transgender\nathletes we had clergy speak against\nsb1 we had parents of transgender\nchildren speak speak against\nsb1 not a single coach not a single\nathletic\norganization not a one zero which\nincidentally is the amount of\ntransgender students competing in K\nthrough 12 Sports in Georgia\nzero so who spoke in favor of it two\nright-wing\norganizations the uh faith and uh oh\ngosh the faith and freedom\ncoalition and\nFrontline what the heck do they have to\ndo with women's sports this is why the\nlast time I got up here I dragged y'all\nabout the Bible because if the only\npeople you've got to speak to this bill\nare religious right and one of them\ncategorized as a hate Group by the\nSouthern Poverty Law Center if that's\nthe best you can bring I don't think\nwe're accomplishing safety in women's\nsports what we're accomplishing is a\nright-wing political theological agenda\nbeing woven into our code and letting\ntransgender people know that they are\nsinful wrong and not welcome in\nGeorgia now it's true that Riley Gaines\nwhom this bill is named after um spoke\nfor this bill the only athlete that we\nheard speak to the bill by the\nby now this bill is sb1 sb1 we know that\nto get to that number number one in uh\nin a session in a legislative session\nwhen we're dropping legislation you got\nto be purposeful to be number one you\ngot to be purposeful and on the ball\nthere when the opportunity opens for us\nto drop legislation boom sb1 priority\nwhat is\nhb1 hb1 is a democratic bill called the\nPediatric safe storage act that's what\nwe rushed to this house that's what we\nbrought a desire to protect our students\na desire to protect young people from\nmaking a tragic mistake that harms them\nor others that's what Democrats brought\nyou this is\nsb1 sb1 the Senate's first priority is a\nproblem that does not exist because you\nmust get your message out that trans\npeople are not welcome here we get it\ntrust me they get it okay my daughter\nhas many friends that are transgender\nshe's a gentle soul she drives she kind\nof draws these people to\nher and one of them shook my hand the\nnight I won this seat the first time and\nsaid thank you I'm glad that you won I\nknow you'll stand up for people like\nme another friend of hers was relaxing\nat our house one night she came she's a\nKen my daughter's a kenas state came\nhome with some friends and this was\nafter last session's big trans hoopla\nand she said I feel like my state\ndoesn't want me to\nlive and I said\nwell they sure not they're sure not\nsupporting\nyou\nso one the NCAA has changed its policy\non uh transgender athletes the ioc has\nrules in place that deal with\ntransgender athletes the Georgia High\nSchool Association has rules that deal\nwith transgender athletes I question\nwhy we must double down and triple down\nthey they have not asked us for\nthis now 16 female athletes in the NCAA\nsigned on with Riley bar with Riley\num gains thank you with Riley uh gains\nfor her lawsuit against NCAA okay\n16 in response to that lawsuit over\n400\nNCAA professional Olympic par Olympic\nathletes over 400 signed an open letter\nto the\nNCAA saying please just leave trans\nfolks\nalone uh we'd we'd really rather you\nfocus on something else when it comes to\ninequity in women's\nsports like perhaps the fact that\n21% of women\nand 11% of young men say they have been\nsexually\nabused sexually\nabused during Sports when they were\nyoung now that's a fire alarm okay\nthat's a problem when 21% one in five\nwomen are being sexually assaulted while\nthey play\nsport it's not trans athletes that are\ndoing that to\nthem so I\nam actually proud\num to stand against\nsb1 um I would ask that if you want to\ngovern by the Bible I mean go all the\nway go all the way to love your neighbor\nas yourself if you want to govern by the\nConstitution fair and equal treatment\nbefore the law is what is our goal\nwhat's our\ngoal what's our\ngoal thank you Mr Speaker I yield The\nWell the lady has yielded the well\nrepresent asine\nClark is recognized speak to the bill\nrepresentative\nClark thank you Mr\nSpeaker colleagues today I Rise to ask\nyou to vote no on this bill because this\nbill does not make our children\nsafer this bill is a license to harass\nto bully and to\nharm and if you don't believe me let me\ntell you the story of Amy Toms who is\nwho is 22 years old when this happened\nAmy Sports a pixie cut I don't know if\nany of you all in here have a pixie cut\nit's a short\nhaircut she was followed into the\nbathroom at her job by a man yelling\nexpletives at her telling her that she\ndoesn't belong and that she's\ndisgusting and you know why he did that\nit's because he thought she was trans\nshe is not trans she is cisgendered she\njust didn't happen to look girly enough\nfor him and he felt like that gave him\nthe right to harass\nher this is the type of harassment that\nwe would be inviting into our\nschools let me to tell you the story\nabout Jessica Rush Jessica Rush was\naccosted in a restroom at the Baylor\nMedical Center at a hospital because she\nwas dressed in basketball shorts and a\nt-shirt the man admitted multiple times\nthat he thought she was a boy because\nshe was quote dressed like a man so a\nperson can't go to the hospital to visit\ntheir loved ones dressed in a T-shirt\nand basketball shorts without being\nharassed because they don't look girly\nenough do you have to wear a dress in\norder to not be\nharassed Kaa Morton she was approached\nin a restroom in Arizona by police by\npolice officers and let me be clear male\npolice officers after a store employee\nassumed that she was\ntrans so two male officers came into the\nwomen's restroom shined a flashlight\nlight into the stall where she was\nsitting down\nurinating shined a flashlight in there\nand demanded that she come out of the\nrestroom when she came out she literally\nhad to lift up her shirt and expose her\nbreast expose her breast to prove that\nshe was a woman because someone assumed\nshe was trans and felt like that was\nlicensed for them to send the police\nafter her do we want girls in our\nschools having to expose their bras or\ntheir breasts to school resource\nofficers to prove that they are\ngirls and I keep hearing how this bill\nis supposed to create an even playing\nfield but I want to introduce you all to\nmabs who did not ask for this Spotlight\nbut it came upon\n[Music]\nhim he he is a trans\nboy and because of a similar law that\npassed in\nTexas Mack who begged to compete against\nboys because he is a boy Mack was told\nthat he had to compete with the weight\nclass and the sex that was assigned on\nhis birth certificate so you know what\nMac had to do that's Mac up there that's\nMac right there they made mac compete\nagainst girls and he won he won fair and\nsquare Mack had been\ntransitioning yes he was taking\ntestosterone but what happened in this\nin in this instance was the bill that\nwe're asking for\ntoday we actually that actually made\nparents even more upset because now\nthey're like why is this boy competing\nagainst my little girl and they said\nit's because it's the law\nthat's what this bill is doing this does\nnot quote even the playing field it just\nis a license to harass to bully and to\nharm also this bill and similar bills\nlike\nit completely leave out individuals in\nour society that are intersex and if\nthere is nothing that you will learn at\nthe end of this session you will learn\nthat intersex people do exist and\nsometimes people have ambiguous\ngenitalia and sometimes that means that\nwhen they are born their parents get to\nchoose we're going to decide that she's\na girl we're going to decide that he's a\nboy and they have no idea what that\nindividual grow will grow up to decide\nor feel like when they get older because\nthey have a mixture of\nboth and bills like this completely\nerase them off the planet I'm actually\nnot sure and I have not been able to get\na solid or straight answer from anyone\nas to what sport a interex individual\nactually gets to play do they get to\nplay with girls do they get to play with\nboys it's so unclear no one has been\nable to answer it for me so how do I\ntell my constituents that are parents of\nintersex individuals or people who have\num gen genetic sex disorders how do I\ntell them where they fit because because\naccording to this law they don't exist\nand that is just not right so unlike\nmany in this chamber I am a parent and\nnot only am not a parent I'm a parent of\nan athlete she plays basketball she runs\ntrack she's played soccer she's played\nvolleyball she is an athlete by all all\nmeans of imagination I mean she's\ngreat and so I asked her I said baby\ngirl\nhow do you feel about this war on girl\nSports because it's the Talk of the Town\ndown at the capital but since you're\nplaying in sports I would love to hear\nyour thoughts on it and she looked at me\nconfused and she said Mom what are you\ntalking about and I said you know the\nwar on girl Sports the one where y'all\nare so worried about the trans us trans\nathletes you know bumping you out of\ncontention or and she said my um no one\nno one is talking about that y'all are\ntalking about that we are not talking\nabout that in the locker room and so we\nhave created a\nbill that is a license to harass a\nlicense to bully a license to harm and\nthese actual\nathletes do not want this they did not\nask for\nthis and I think that that is a problem\nI think that if you truly care about all\nof your constituents then you would ask\nthem you would actually ask the people\nthat would be most impacted by this bill\nand the ones that are most impacted are\nsaying we do not want this so I'm going\nto leave you all with\nthis if you would like to see trans boys\ncompeting against cisgender girls which\nthis bill will do then you will probably\ngo ahead and hit the green button if you\nare okay with police officers making\nyour daughter or your friend's daughter\nyour niece your little cousin expose\ntheir breast to prove they are a girl\nthen you will push green on this\nbutton but if you actually care about\nyour constituents and you understand\nthat laws like this do not actually make\nanyone safer and it's just a license to\nharm a license to bully and a license to\nharass then you will vote no on sb1\nthank you Mr Speaker I yield The\nWell the lady has yielded the well\nrepresentative Eric\nBell is recognized to speak to the bill\nrepresent de Bell\n[Music]\nthank you Mr Speaker for being a\nknowledge today colleagues I rise in\nopposition of sb1 the so-called Riley\ngangs act because it is not to govern by\ntruth but it's political clout I stand\nhere as a heter as a heterosexual\ncisgendered man whose sister didn't fit\nthe mode of what some\ncall or some say is a woman she grew up\nwearing sneakers instead of heels\nplaying basketball with the boys instead\nof jumping rope with the girls and guess\nwhat she is still a\nwoman still is a child of God and still\nfearfully and wonderfully made Psalms\n139: 14 says I praise you for I am\nfearfully and wonderfully made wonderful\nare your Works my soul knows it very\nwell but like this bill that does not\naffirm the\ntruth this doesn't uplift anyone but\nthis bill laws like this sends a message\nto some of our kids that they do not\nbelong that some kids deserve that some\nkids don't deserve the same\nopportunities that some kids deserve to\nbe punished for just existing when some\nof these kids are the very kids have\nbeen victims of traumatic past both\npreviously and\nnow and for what why are we doing this\nfor political points headlines the next\nposition we want to run for a\ndistraction but I'm here to talk facts\nso let's talk about\nit the Georgia High School Association\nalready prohibits transgender athletes\nfrom competing in sports outside their\nbiological sex so what would this bill\ndo the\nNCAA has has already made it clear that\nthe rules of\nEligibility and right now it is very and\nright now at this very moment there is\nno transgender athlete competing in\nGeorgia's public\nschools again there is no right now\nthere is no transgender athlete\ncompeting in Georgia's public schools so\nif this is about fairness or not if it's\nabout protecting our children and\nprotect in our students or not if it's\nnot about addressing the real issues\nthen what is it really about this bill\nsolves no problems because no problem\nexists let me repeat this bill solves no\nproblem because no problem truly exists\nso what does this bill do what does sb1\nactually\ndo it invites costly unlimited lawsuits\nagainst our schools a student can be\nsued a student can sue a school for\nanticipated horn for something that\nhasn't even happened schools can be sued\nfor emotional distress with no clear\nlimits and for\nwhat yet just weeks ago we stood here\nholding that t reform was our number one\npriority that was to protect businesses\nfrom excessive lawsuits for protecting\nbusinesses from litigation which was\ngood policy then why is exposing scho\nschool to litigation\nacceptable so I asked why do\ncorporations get protection but not\nPublic Schools why are public schools\nleft holding their\nhandbag and what and for what about and\nfor what about protecting women's sports\nlet's be real this bill does not protect\nfemale athletes it endangers them if it\nwere to we would be talking about equal\nfunding better facilities more\nscholarship ships but we're not because\nhere's the truth men Sports receive more\nresources more funding and more\nattention than women's sports today\nthat's a real the real inequity is in\nathletics but instead of addressing that\nwe are debating manufactur crises one\nthat does not help women at all one that\ndoes not protect girls at all this bill\nisn't about fairness is about\nfear but instead of solving the real\nissue we're spending more time on\npolitical spun political stunts georg's\nfamily sent us up here to solve real\nproblems problems such as Affordable\nHealth Care affordable housing school\nsafety Economic\nOpportunity but we're here dealing with\nwomen's sports instead this bill is\nabout\ndistraction this bill is nothing more\nthis bill is nothing more to improve our\nschools our communities our economy only\nfurthering political\npits it will drain money from our class\nrooms and put us in the\ncourtrooms it will send a message it\nwill send a message that's already heard\ntoday that vulnerable kids are not\nwelcomed that vulnerable kids in Georgia\nare\nunwelcomed and to what point to the\npoint of division that advis us instead\nof brings us together and for what to\nmake harder to make life harder on\nchildren is that is this what we're\ndoing as a man of Faith as a brother to\na woman who is different but no less\nworthy and as a leg and as a legislator\nwho has took a oath to serve all people\nof Georgia I cannot stand by and support\nthis bill Matthew 25: 40 says truly I\ntell you what you do for one of the\nleast of these brothers and sisters of\nmine you did for\nme let's not let's be judged by how we\ntreat the least of thee not by how we\nplay political politics how we play\npolitics and I refuse to stand here and\nwatch children become political become\ncollateral damage in a political\ngame because my faith teaches me\nsomething different my conscience tells\nme something different my sister's\nlife her\nstrength her\nresilience her\nworth has taught me something\ndifferent so let so let's ask ourselves\nwhen the history book looks back at this\nmoment moment how will we be\njudged will we be judged by the\nlegislature that further victimize\nvictims or will we be the ones that\nended poverty in\nGeorgia will we be the ones that solve\nhomelessness or will we be the ones\nknown to play\npolitics so I say let's do the right\nthing it's our time to do the right\nthing\nbut we have to vote no and we have to\nvote no now for just for clarity Vander\nbill has done a study that showed that\n83% of lgbtqia individuals have have\nsuffered some type of drama whether it's\nbeen physical or sexual abuse and here\nwe have a bill that further victimizes\nvictims with that Mr Speaker I urge I\nurge this body to vote no and I yield\nthe will thank you\nyou a gentleman at yield of the\nwell representative park Canon is\nrecognized to speak to the bill\nrepresentative\nCanon thank you Mr speaker thank you\nmembers for your attention today is\ntransgender day of visibility it is an\nannual day where transgender individuals\naround the United States\nstand up proudly in their bold\nidentities as daring to say I don't feel\nright in this body but if I can get\naccess to mental health care and\nphysical health care if I can have\nsupport from social communities and\nCommunity organizations that I will feel\nbetter so instead of celebrating trans\nday of visibility today we are literally\nerasing transgender Georgians\nI am speechless but instead I'm going to\ntake this 15 minutes and I'm going to\nspeak to y'all about the importance of\nthe transgender community and some of\nthe truths as to what this bill does\nfirst I want to ask each of you have any\nof you ever been present for a gender or\nsex ambiguous birth have you ever been\nin the room when that has happened well\nI have and as one of our members spoke\nto\nwhat\nhappens what happens is families in that\nmoment get to choose how they will\nsocialize their child until their\ngenitalia has developed enough and\nwithin that time period within those\nnext two years they can go to medical\nprofessionals and figure out what is\nbest for their child they don't come to\nthe State Constitution and say well\nwhat's legal and what sport is my kid\ngoing to play and base it off of that\nwe have reports here that show that\ntransgender discrimination claims have\nalready cost Georgia taxpayers\n$4.1\nmillion that figure includes $2.1\nmillion to settle those claims and\nanother another two midle inlegal fees I\nhave placed this on your desk because I\nthink it's really important that we talk\nabout this is such a big issue so let's\ngo over the cases that we we thought\nwere so great miss Carrie Scott a staff\nattorney in the state court system said\nafter a long process of self-reflection\nshe realized about 2 and a half years\nago that she needed to transition to\nalign with her identity as a transgender\nwoman her surgery was covered by her\nstate health benefits plan it has been a\nwonderful thing that's happened in my\nlife that surgery was incredible for my\nwellbeing I was in a lot of pain\nemotionally and now I'm not in pain in\n2015 a transgender inmate said she was\nrefused adequate care and Sue the\nDepartment of Corrections the department\nagreed to use qualified medical and\nmental health professionals to evaluate\ninmates with possible gender dysphoria a\ndiagnosis used to identify distress\ncause when a person's gender identity\ndiffers from the sex listed on their\nbirth certificate in 2021 two\ntransgender\nwomen sued the state when they were\ndenied gender affirming surgeries under\nGeorgia's medic health insurance program\nthe the State Department of Community\nHealth settled the case a year later\nagreeing to amend its policy to pay for\ngender affirming care through Medicaid\nin 2019 a ug employee won a settlement\nthat requires the state's University\nsystem to cover medically necessary\nexpenses including gender confirmation\nsurgeries and in 20123 three transgender\nmen reached a settlement that requires\nthe state health benefits plan to pay\nfor gender dysphoria treatment now I\nunderstand what this piece of policy\ndoes here I know that there's some level\nof misleading that is trying to happen\nto say oh but it's not\n267 it actually does have some of those\nProvisions from 267 in it and so either\nway we are looking at millions and\nmillions of dollars in lawsuits now\nlet's talk about hate crimes we spent\nour time years ago working on hate\ncrimes legislation it was so important\nthat we spent that entire session\nworking on that bill back and forth\nuntil it passed well in states with\nthese restrictive laws the number of\nhate crimes on K through2 campuses has\nmore than quadrupled at the same time\ncalls to lgbtq youth crisis hotlines\nhave\nexploded the number of\nanti-lgbtq school hate crimes serious\nenough to be reported to local police\nmore than doubled Nationwide between\n2015 and 19 and again between 21 and\n2022 calls have spiked to the Trevor\nProject which provides support to lgbtq\nyouth aimed at Suicide Prevention and\nCrisis Intervention in the fiscal year\nof 2022 the group fielded about\n230,000 crisis contacts the following\nyear it was more than\n500,000 similarly the rainbow youth\nproject in 2022 had a th000 hotline\ncalls and in 2023 had 1,400\nthe rainbow youth project saw a crush of\ncalls from Oklahoma specifically rising\nfrom 321 in January to nearly 1100 in\nFebruary the week following next\nBenedict's death in 2021 and 20122 the\nmost recent years for which data was\navailable the average more than doubled\nto\n232 hate crimes at schools so hate\ncrimes we used to care about that issue\nwe used to try to create an agent\nthat could actually look at these hate\ncrimes and now we're trying to find more\nways let's talk about verifying sex sex\nverification testing so what is sex\nverification testing it is outdated and\npseudoscientific ideas about sex that\ndisproportionately impact women whose\nbodies do not conform to narrow gender\nstereotypes how do they do this one\nphysical examinations inspections of an\nathlete's genitals often degrading and\ninvasive two chromosomal testing lab\ntests that examine an athletes DNA to\ndetermine whether they have XX or XY\nchromones chromosomes three hormone\ntesting blood or urine test to measure\ntestosterone levels despite the fact\nthat this type of test is scientifically\nflawed and fails to account for genetic\ndiversity as I close inclusive of pelvic\nultrasounds or MRIs Imaging tests to\ndetermine an athletes reproductive\nAnatomy which could be used to exclude\nintersex women from competition I ask\nthat you vote against this bill I have a\nlot more to say on it but on trans day\nof visibility if you can't just let\ntransgender people live alone please\ntake a walk thank you Mr\nspeaker thank you representative\nCanon that concludes our speakers there\nwe'll be ready for the Minority Report\nand cherish time is there any objection\nto the previous question being ordered\nhearing none the previous question is\nordered we have up to 20 minutes for the\nMinority Report and then up to 20\nminutes for the chair's\ntime whip Park is recognized to speak to\nthe bill up to 20 minutes I guess you'll\nallocate those yes sir thank you sir\ngentleman's\nrecognized thank you Mr Speaker good\nmorning colleagues uh unfortunately we\nare here debating another\ndivisive culture War issue that will do\nnothing to support Georgia students and\ndo everything to harm vulnerable Georgia\nchildren here in this state and so I ask\nall members on both sides of the aisle\nto either vote no or to walk on S\nsp1 now the author of The Bill said that\nthis piece of legislation went through\nan enormous amount of scrutiny over\nmultiple years well y'all look it up\nthere's not a single transgender\nathlete in our Public\nSchools this bill accomplishes\nabsolutely\nnothing with respect to\nfairness and of course this really isn't\nabout fairness is it this is about\ndiscrimination I have to ask myself so\noften why is the majority party so\nintent to discriminate against\ntransgender children in the state of\nGeorgia so intent to discriminate\nagainst vulnerable\nchildren do members of the majority\nparty not\nrecognize that these sorts of pieces of\nlegislation Drive children to commit\nsuicide as demonstrated by multiple\nstudies on on these pieces of\nlegislation do members of the majority\nparty not recognize that this will drive\nharassment and bullying of the most\nvulnerable children in our schools is\nthere no\nconcern from members of the majority\nparty about the least among\nus we stood today for a\nbird a\nbird while we are passing legislation to\nharm georg's\nchildren\nnow as the author again mentioned\nearlier in his remarks we could have\ncalled this a Gavin\nact yet another reminder that this is a\npolitical culture War issue that will\ncause harm to Georgia's most vulnerable\nstudents and so again a last last point\nI will make on this is you know\nthroughout this legislative session how\nmuch time and effort did we spend on\ntort\nreform how much time and effort did the\nmajority party spend bullying and\ntwisting arms to make it harder for\ninjured georan Georgians and victims of\nsexual assault to hold those accountable\nfor causing them\nharm and yet at the same time we open up\nall of our schools to litigation to\nfrivolous lawsuits\nthat's the majority party what what\nincentive do y'all have other than this\nmanufactured culture war in which y'all\nhave scared your voters into harming a\nvulnerable Community as to actually\nliving up to the dictates of your\nfaith that clearly mean nothing as\ndemonstrated by your\nactions and so y'all I'm sick and tired\nof being sick and tired of children in\nthis State being used as political ponds\nwhich is what this bill\ndoes this is\nunacceptable and so again I urge members\nto vote no or to walk on this nonsense\nissue that will cause so much more harm\nto the most vulnerable Among Us than to\nactually do anything of benefit to\nGeorgia students thank you Mr Speaker I\nyield the\nwell gentleman is yield the yielded the\nwell representative Wilkerson is\nrecognized speak to the bill\nrepresentative Wilkerson thank you Mr\nSpeaker today I come to oppose uh Senate\nbill one uh the education committee does\na really good job typically of vetting\nbills and and in this case we did fix\nsome things um the initial draft of 267\nwhich is very similar to this would have\nbanned coaches from even going in the\nlocker room at halftime to talk to the\nyoung ladies it took about five of us to\nconvince the author that this was bad\nbut once Frontline agreed that it was\nokay change they made the change and so\nlet me tell you what I'm here as I'm\nhere as a\nfather a coach a Christian a husband\nlike many of you and we are a\nrepresentative of the people and as also\nof our experiences and so there are a\nlot of times these experiences you may\nnot know what it means to be a coach of\nyoung women I do and I can tell you no\nyoung ladies I work with and have\ncoached think this is an important\nbill what I will say is up there is I'm\nassuming is going to be one of the\nmethods of verifying a child sex because\nthe initial bill said we use birth\ncertificate Riley Gaines went on the\ninternet and said that we can't do that\nso we took the the the the the birth\ncertificate out right there is the form\nyou can't really see it very good but if\nyou go to the next slide it asks you a\nbunch of\nquestions and then this is the form that\nyou actually turn in nowhere on that\nform does it say what your gender is\nnowhere on that Forum does it say what\nyour sex\nis so think about this how will we\nverify a students sex when it comes to\ncompetition and so what I'm going to ask\nyou to do is I know people are going to\nvote no I know people will vote Yes\nthose of that that do vote Yes I ask\nwhen it goes to the Senate you fix this\none\npart lines 136\nsays that nothing in this section shall\nbe construed to authorize a covered\nentity or an athletic association to\nverify or confirm a student's sex\nthrough visual\ninspection and then it goes on to say we\ncan rely on medical records but as you\nsee you don't have it on the medical\nrecords or other standard medical\nprocedures to verify cons student\nsex so let's say we're going to the\nchampionship game my 12-year-old\ncompetes my 13-year-old competes in high\nschool she she's at halftime someone CH\nchallenges her and said that is a male\nthat is a male we need to verify who's\ngoing to go in the locker room there is\nno protections for children in this bill\nto say that an adult has to be present\nwhen they physically inspect a child\nthere is no protection in this bill at\nall so you were going to send a\nchild that wants to\ncompete and I'm asking for the Larry\nNasser Amendment right now and when I\nsay Larry Nasser amendment that means\nthat there was the coach of the Olympic\nteam actually he was a he was a doctor\nhe was a doctor you he went 20 years\nabusing children because these\n13-year-olds wanted to compete in the\nOlympics and they thought that it was\nokay for a man to put them in a position\nthat they had no opportunity to fight\nback CU they wanted to\ncompete we are going to do this to\nchildren every day there are kids on the\nfield that they think it's unfair\nthey're going to be in the state\nchampionship and you're going to look at\nthe other child and you're going to say\nthat is a boy and then what's going to\nhappen at the end at halftime the coach\nis going to go in there and look at my\nchild I wish someone would come home and\nsay my child my daughter had some coach\nlooking at them it's going to be a fight\nnow how many of you men agree with me\nthat's going to be that's going to be a\nchallenge so what I'm asking you to do\nis when this goes to the Senate I don't\ncare how you vote don't put children in\nthe position where they have to say no\nto a grown\nman think about that don't put your\nyoung daughters in a position where they\nhave to stand up to a man that is bigger\nthat is taller that is stronger that has\nmore authority over they do because they\nwant to play a sport that they love\nthey're not concerned about about a\ntransgender athlete they're concerned\nabout someone touching them someone\nattacking them because they have the\npower to do it there are many other\nexamples you have male wrestlers who\ncouldn't stand up to a wrestling coach\nso you telling me I ask as this bill\nmoves take it to the Senate let them\namend it send it back you all agree you\npass the bill we do what's already in\nlaw which bans people from feeding sex\nthat is not the one they're born with\nthat is all that I ask anybody that's\never sat in the education committee\nknows that whether I like a bill whether\nI dislike a bill I'm going to try to do\nwhat's best for our children and that's\nwhat I'm doing right now is this is a\ndangerous bill it's not just a bad Bill\nit's a dangerous bill because we're\ngoing to put young ladies at risk and\nwith that I yield the well Mr\nSpeaker gentleman has yielded the well\nrepresentative drenner has recognized to\nspeak to the bill representating\nJena oh man do you all to see baby Jesus\ndown\nhere that's\nperfect thank you\nMr thank you Mr\nSpeaker I had two separate speeches\nprepared today and so I'm going to go\nback and forth between the two of\nthem so I rise today in strong\nopposition to Senate bill one a bill\nthat claims to protect fairness and\nsafety but instead singles out\ntransgendered kids for\ndiscrimination let's be\nclear this is not about fairness this is\nnot about safety and this is about\npolitics across the country we've seen a\nwave of\nlegislation just like Cil one bill\nthat use trans kids as political\nscapegoats to distract from real issues\nlike underfunded schools gun violence\nand the lack of Mental Health\nResources this is a manufactured crisis\ndesigned not to solve a real problem but\nto create Division and\nfear we have seen this Playbook before\nthe same arguments were used against\nracial integration in school RS against\nwomen competing in sports and against\nsame-sex marriage now transgendered\nyouth are the largest or the latest\nTarget we must reject this attempt to\nturn children into a political\nBattleground and instead focus on real\nsolutions that support all\nstudents so let's take a moment to\nexamine the real effects of this bill by\naddressing the arguments its supporters\nhave put forth number one supporters of\nsb1 claim it's a about protecting\nwomen's\nsports but where's the evidence of a\ncrisis transgendered athletes make up a\ntiny fraction of\nparticipants National and state\norganizations already have Fair\ncompetition policies in place if\nfairness were really the goal we'd be\ntalking about unequal pay and funding\nfor women Athletics disparities in\nscholarships and coaching\nopportunities the real threats to women\nin sports like sexual harassment and\nabuse sb1 does nothing to address these\nproblems instead it targets a small\ngroup of students to score political\npoints now no one on my side\nhas taken a moment to talk about Riley\nGaines and I would like to do that Riley\ngains publicly has shared her experience\nagainst Leah\nThomas and I want to say\nclearly to\nRiley I empathize with your\nfrustration competing at the highest\nlevel is a huge\naccomplishment and it's understandable\nthat you would be\nupset and that you felt that the playing\nfield was not level and if I was your\nmother I would have been mad\ntoo but you know\nwhat we fixed\nthat we fixed\nthat the Georgia High School Association\nfix\nthat this\nbill athle\nAssociation\nhowever One race one event does not\njustify legislation that impacts\nthousands of\nchildren her experience your experience\nRiley I listened to\nyou and when you said woke liberal\nagenda I had to stop I don't know what\nwoke me just like I didn't know what OG\nmeant I woke every morning so I was\nconfused about that\nexpression your experience is being used\nto create fear and justify policies that\nare going to hurt lots of other people\nincluding transgender kids who are\ntrying to find their place in this world\nRy gain's story is valid but it's being\npoliticized and it does not repres\npresent the larger issue we cannot craft\na policy based on isolated cases\nespecially when the cost is Banning an\nentire group of kids from participating\nin sports we need to focus on solutions\nthat support all athletes not just those\nwho fit a specific narrative this bill\ndoesn't solve the fairness this bill\ndoesn't solve the fairness issues in\nwomen's Sports it's about creating fear\nand dividing us further another argument\nthat we've heard is that allowing\ntransgendered students to use\nappropriate facilities threatens privacy\nor\nsafety but the facts do not support this\nclaim there is no evidence that\ntransgender students using the restroom\nor locker room that aligns with their\ngender identity leads to increase in\nharm\nschools already have the flexibility to\nmake accommodations for all students\nwithout this government\noverreach let's not forget women were\nonce told they couldn't share locker\nrooms with black athletes they were once\ntold that allowing them into sports\nwould ruin\nAthletics these same Scare Tactics are\nbeing used again just with new targets\nsb1 doesn't protect privacy it creates a\nculture of fear and exclusion I usion\nproponents of this bill say that biology\nalone should determine Sports\nparticipation but this argument is\noverly simplistic and selectively\napplied we don't ban cisgender female\nathletes who naturally have higher\ntestosterone levels we don't exclude\nstudents with genetic advantages like\nheight wingspan or lung capacity we\nallow student athletes of different\nsizes strengths and abilities to compete\nevery day sports are about skill\ntraining and discipline not just\nbiology this bill cherry-picks science\nto justify discrimination while ignoring\nthe complexity of human\nbiology Title Nine was meant to expand\nopportunities for women not to exclude\ntransgender girls if we truly want to\nprotect women's sports we should be\nfighting for Equal Pay ensuring equal\nfunding for women's programs and\nprotecting athletes from H harassment\nand abuse s sp1 does none of these\nthings because it's not about women's\nsports it's about creating a political\nwedge\nissue some people argue that polls show\npublic support for for Banning trans\nkids from sports or locker rooms but we\nmust\nremember public opinion wants oppose\nracial integration in schools and\nsports public opinion once oppose women\nfrom playing contact Sports heck public\nopinion used to say women couldn't even\nvote Justice is not determined by\npolling numbers laws should be based on\nfairness evidence and equality not fear\nor political\nTrends\nsb1 does none of those\nthings instead it manufactures a problem\ncreates Division and makes transgendered\nstudents less\nsafe in\nconclusion let's call this bill what it\nis a political\ndistraction a manufactured culture War a\nharmful policy that makes life harder\nfor transgendered\nkids it's not about fairness it's not\nabout\nsafety this is really about using\nchildren as ponds in a political game I\nurge you to vote no on S sp1\nlet's focus on real solutions for\nfairness privacy and safety not\ngovernment mandated\ndiscrimination thank you Mr Speaker I\nyield the\nwell thank you the lady has yielded the\nwell now we'll have up to 20 minutes for\nchair's time we're recognized the\nchairman of the committee from which it\ncame the education committee chairman\nIrwin is recognized to speak to\nsb1 thank you Mr Speaker and colleagues\nI rise today in strong support of the\nRiley gains Act of\n2025 a measure rooted in the fundamental\nbeliefs that\nfairness safety and integrity in school\nand Collegiate Sports must be preserved\nfor all student athletes across Georgia\nthe bill affirms that athletic comp or\nathletic competition should be based on\nclear biological standards ensuring that\nfemale athletes who have historically\nfought for Equal Opportunity are not\ndenied the right to compete on a\nleveling playing field the rally gains\nact requires our public and\nparticipating private schools as well as\npostsecondary institutions to designate\nsports teams as male female or co-ed\nbased solely on biological sex it\nprohibits male from competing in female\nsports thereby protecting the\ncompetitive balance and physical safety\nthat women's sports depend upon at the\nsame time it provides for limited\nexceptions where no female team is\navailable and ensures co-ed teams remain\naccessible to all\nstudents this legislation does not\nTarget\nindividuals it targets\ninequities it safeguards the decades a\nprogress made in women's Athletics by\nreaffirming the state's interest in\npromoting equal opportunity and pro\npreventing unfair\nadvantages the bill also respects\nprivacy by ensuring that shared\nfacilities used during competitions such\nas locker rooms restrooms and sleeping\nquarters are designated and used\naccording to biological\nsex while still offering reasonable\naccommodations for all students\nthe Riley gains act includes a robust\nenforcement and grievance mechanism\nstudents who are deprived of\nopportunities or face retaliation have a\nclear path to seek\nredress this is not just a policy of\nprotection is a declaration of\nfairness safety and\ntransparency in Georgia Sports\ncolleagues this bill speaks to the heart\nof athletic integrity\nit is about ensuring that every child\nregardless of gender has a chance to\ncompete safely and fairly and that the\nhard one victories for female athletes\nare not\nerased I urge your favorable\nconsideration of the Riley gains act let\nus stand for fairness let us stand for\nsafety let us stand for\nopportunity Mr Speaker I'm going to\nyield the remaining of the uh Chairman's\ntime to the the gentleman that is\ncarrying the bill if you would allow\nme that's the\nChairman's\nright still has time on on his 20\nminutes he's uh relinquished his time to\nChairman Bonner representative Bonner\nthank you Mr Speaker colleagues uh we\nhave heard some outrageous claims from\nthis well personal attacks perversions\nof scripture mistruths and just Flatout\nlies so let me boil down the issue\nbiological males have an inherent\nphysiological\nAdvantage allowing that advantage on the\nfield places females at risk let me\nhighlight this with a personal story two\nyears ago at my daughter's high school\nshe shared a class with a boy pretending\nto be a girl my daughter's he believed\nthat my daughter's friend misgendered\nhim and so after class that boy\npretending to be a girl\njumped my daughter's friend put her on\nthe ground and beat her mercely without\nMercy time and time again the female\nteacher couldn't even pull this boy off\nof her it took four individuals to pull\nthis boy off of my daughter's friend as\nhe pounded her head time and time again\nso don't tell me there is no\nAdvantage for a biological male on an\nathletic\nfield a yes vote provides a necessary\nprotections for my daughter and\nthousands of other female athletes in\nGeorgia as for walking on this vote I\ndon't know about your constituents but\nmine sent me here to know where I\nstand I'm asking each of you to stand\nwith me and the overwhelming majority of\nGeorgians that support keeping\nbiological males out of

do you do\nyou want to speak or you have a question\nyou're signed up to speak sir yes sir I\nhave a question okay the ladies\nrecognize for a question thank you Mr\nSpeaker do you yield I do awesome um so\nwith this grant program how long will\nthis grant program run how is the\nfunding coming and how will it be\nreported to the general assembly so we\ndo have a fiscal note on that um it is\ngoing to be overseen by the by gima and\nHomeland Security and the appro it it\nwill last as long as there are\nAppropriations for it okay so a further\ninquiry there is a fiscal note to

okay\nI've already asked the I'm not trying to\nask the question again but I subject to\nappropriation I think would be the\nanswer to that correct thank you Mr\nSpeaker subject to\nAppropriations okay and then the final\nquestion I had already asked you before\nwhich is how will this be reported back\nto the general assembly I don't see any\nlanguage here on how it will be reported\nback to the general\nassembly I have no idea when when the\nfunds are exhausted then that that will\nbe the end of the\nprogram lady has no further questions\nthank you Mr Speaker I askit minute lady\ndoes have a question excuse me\nrepresentative rice to your left is\nrecognized for a question thank you Mr\nSpeaker does a gentle lady yeld I do is\nit not true that by prioritizing\nhospitals lacking any existing backup\npower this bill strategically directs\nresources to the greatest area of need\nabsolutely thank you so much for saying\nthat if you had been where I had and you\nsaw fire department with a Bucket\nBrigade flushing toilets and bringing up\nwater for PE for nurses to wash their\nhands youd understand why we need it\nthank you so much representative Butner\nto your left about Midway back is\nrecognized for a question uh does the\ngentleman gentle lady yield excuse me\nall right I I'm very familiar with your\nbill and how important it is and very\nsupportive of it I also have people back\nhome that are interested in the homeless\nCouncil and I'm I'm having trouble\nfinding where that is in the bill\nnow I'm not\nsure this is a substitute it was\nstripped and put this in there that's\nthe only thing that I can tell you the\ngone I think that's the case thank you\nmajority extration has one last question\nfinal question yes sir thank you Mr\nSpeaker General lady yield I do to my\nfriend ma'am is it not true that this\nlegislation it's the exact same text as\nHouse Bill 262 I believe that we\npreviously passed 173 to Zer and that U\nno fiscal node necessary because it's\nsubject to appropriation or other Grant\nthat's to be received and obviously the\ngeneral assembly would be able to follow\nthat because appropriation would be\nnecessary for this critical measure to\nprovide generators at rural hospitals\nwhich we saw were so very critical after\nHurricane Helen is I appreciate you\nsaying that Mr later better than I could\nhave thank you so much I'll yield the\nwhale ladies yield of the whale\nrepresentative Park Cannon is recognized\nto speak to the bill representative\nCanon thank you Mr Speaker I'm here to\nspeak in favor of this measure um\nbecause we can have questions on the\nbill and we can still support it um the\nfirst thing that I just want to be\nreally clear on is the practice of us\nLing legislation one way or the other\nand then saying the like hurricane word\nwe have to do this because of the\nhurricane we have to do this because the\nhurricane because of the tornado because\nof the storm many of\nus are better policy makers in that many\nof us have spent time getting National\nresearch on a number of issues and so\nit's interesting again to see a really\ngreat bill um the original information\nin 170 be completely stripped out and\nnow we're rushing to the Finish Line on\nbackup generators for hospitals um so\nI'm here to speak in support of really\nboth of the pieces of legislation and\nwanted to just remind folks why 170 was\nso important before the big scary word\ncame in um to which we've been told a\nfiscal\nnote is that necessary because it's\nsubject to appropriation I think there\nare many of us who would say that we\nhave bills that will be subject to\nappropriation and we are mandated to\nhave a fiscal note to even get a hearing\nand then even at a hearing when we have\nthat fiscal note it's we're told it's\ntoo much or it's too little so I just\nwish we would be more transparent with\nhow much this will be but for the\noriginal bill which would have\nrecognized that housing is a fundamental\nhuman right and would have United\nimportant stakeholders like government\norganizations and service providers\nhousing Specialists and Advocates to\ncreate an\nall-encompassing long-term solution to\nhomelessness in our state we must\nacknowledge that in 2024 about 12,000\nindividuals on any night are homeless\n52% of the homeless population consider\nthemselves unsheltered meaning they\ndon't have anything to um sleep under\nthere has been been a 4.4% increase in\nhomelessness from 2020 to 2022 and\nAfrican-Americans make up 21% of\nGeorgia's population but 58% of the\nhomeless population it's important that\nwe work together as Fearless caring\nleadership to put resources towards them\nI hope that we will see this bill in its\noriginal version please consider voting\nfor it as it is today thank you Mr\nSpeaker I yel the well\nladies yeld the well that concludes our\nconversation so far on\nsb170 that concludes our comments on\nsb170 is there any objection to the\nprevious question being ordered hearing\nnone the previous question is ordered is\nthere any objection to adopting the\ncommittee substitute the chair hears\nnone committee substitute is adopted is\nthere any objection to agreeing to the\nreport of the committee which was\nfavorable to the passage of the bill\nhearing none the report of the committee\nis agreed to shall this bill now pass\nall in favor of the passage of the bill\nwe'll vote Yes all those opposed we'll\nvote no and Mr clerk will you unlock the\nmachine\nhave all members\nvoted for what purposes represent Al\nrise I'm sorry I missed you earlier\nparliamentary inquiry State your inquiry\nisn't it true that by OSHA standards all\nhospitals have to have emergency\ngenerators\nalready I'm sure the lady is very\nknowledge\nabout health\ncare for what purposes representative\nMartin\nrise parliamentary inquir State your\ninquir uh isn't it true Mr Speaker to\nthe uh last speaker's comments on fiscal\nnotes isn't it true that fiscal notes\nare necessary when we're passing laws\nthat have a statutory requirement on\nthis body that we don't then look at or\nare not subject to Appropriations or\ncause us to have a mandate of a spending\nprocess to either reduce Revenue or a\nspending process those require fiscal\nnotes and by its very definition isn't\nit true Mr Speaker when in the bill it\nsays subject to Appropriations that\nbrings it back before this body and that\nis why fiscal note is not required as\nthe speaker communicated I know the\ngentleman knows of what he speaks for\nwhat purpose does repres Sam Park rise\nparliamentary inquiry State inquiry Sir\nMr Speaker is it not true that while I\ngreatly support the underlying\nlegislation I do not support the fact\nthat we have stripped the Senate\nDemocratic whips legislation regarding\nhomelessness and that both pieces of\nlegislation could have otherwise moved\nforward but it is not I'm sure the\ngentleman firmly believes what he\nspeaks sometimes the process is\ndifficult have all members\nvoted all members voted if so Mr clerk\nwill you lock the machine on the passage\nof Senate Bill 170 the Ys are 165 the\nNays are three this bill hav the\nrequisite constitutional majority is\ntherefore\npassed Mr clerk will you read the\ncaption to Senate Bill 82\n82 Senate Bill 82 by Senator Dixon the\n45th and others being entitled act to\namend article 31 of chapter 2 Title 20\nthe official code of Georgia annotated\nthe charter schools Act of 1998 so to\nenact the local Charter Schools\nauthorization and support Act of 2025\nthis bill having referred to the\ncommittee on education that committee\nrecommends this bill do pass by\ncommittee\nsubstitute chairman Scott Hilton is\nrecognized to present Senate Bill 82\nrepresentative Hilton thank you Mr\nSpeaker I Rise this afternoon to present\nSenate Bill 82 which is a common sense\ncompromise bill that passed the Senate\nwith strong bipartisan support including\na majority of both Republicans and\nDemocrats voting yes yes C Bill 82\naddresses the state's Charter School\naccess issue by incentivizing local\nschool districts to approve more charter\nschools and holding districts\naccountable if they repeatedly deny high\nquality Charter petitions in Georgia how\nwe approve local Charter Schools is out\nof balance with how most Charters are\napproved in most every other state with\nnew approvals resting almost entirely\nwith the state rather than the local\nsystem in this way Georgia is an outlier\nnationally 90% of charter schools are\nauthorized locally and 10% are approved\nat the state level Georgia is basically\nthe inverse of these figures in the past\n5 years alone only one charter school\nwas approved by a local school district\nin Georgia during that same period the\nstate Charter School commission approved\nover 30 schools most of which were\ninitially denied\nlocally so what is the result of this\nbroken process of the nation's 10 most\npopulous states Georgia ranks dead last\nin Charter School access nationally 7%\nof K through2 students attend a charter\nschool compared to 3.5 or half of that\nnumber of K12 students in Georgia in\ndeveloping Senate Bill 82 we partnered\nclosely with the Department of Education\nGeorgia school superintendent\nAssociation the Georgia School Board\nAssociation and I'm grateful for their\ninput and support on this\nlegislation I'll walk you briefly\nthrough the bill itself on section three\nwe provide more transparency by\nrequiring the local boards to provide\ndisclosure around why the denial the\nrationale of the denial and that has to\nbe provided within 20 business days we\nthen provide District accountability so\nfor districts between 10,000 and 6,000\nstudents if a district denies two or\nmore charter schools that are Subs\nquently approved by the state the local\ndistrict is not eligible to renew its\nflexibility contract this changes to\nthree or more for schools serving over\n60,000\nstudents section four of the bill\nprovides an incentive to school systems\nwho approved Charters local locally\napproved charters of 250,000 annually\nfor 3 years up to\n$750,000 section five provides State\nsupport for locals who are seeking to\napprove a locally approved Charter\nSchool\nthere is a Minority Report on cill 82\nand my wife typically tells me not to\nread those as they're bad for my health\nbut I do want to address some of the\npoints raised in the\nreport first and foremost let me dispel\na common misconception as it relates to\nCharter Schools charter schools are\npublic\nschools let me repeat that charter\nschools are public schools the only\ndifference is that they receive less\nfunding typically perform at higher\nrates and have higher\naccountability the second sentence of\nthe mon report Praises exactly what this\nbill aims to achieve local school\ndistricts best understand the needs of\ntheir students and their\ncommunities we believe this to be\nwholeheartedly true which is why Senate\nBill 82 puts in place incentives to\nencourage more local\napprovals financially charter schools\nare responsible for the capital outlay\nfor a new school in fact all charter\nschool systems schools in a system have\na funding holdback of 3% to pay for new\nschools just three years ago this body\npassed a bill which creates additional\ndedicated funding weight for all\nstudents enrolled in local Charters so\nthe districts are pulling more money\nfrom the state to offset costs in this\nbill in this bill school systems can\nreceive\n$750,000 and additional funding when\napproving a new\nschool the data is Crystal Clear among\nthe state authorized charter schools 85%\nof those schools outperform surrounding\nschools in their area in academic\nMastery or growth on Georgia Milestone\nassessments there's going to be a lot of\ntalk about local\ncontrol but let me emphasize this local\ncontrol doesn't start with the local\nschool system it starts with the parents\nparents are the ultimate measure of\nlocal control and the parents have\nclearly spoken Georgia has over 21,000\nstudents on a wait list to attend a\nGeorgia charter school please join me in\nvoting yes on this Common Sense\nbipartisan measure thank you Mr Speaker\nI will yield for questions gentleman has\na number of questions and we have\nspeakers I'm going to uh recognize\nrepresentative um representative let's\nsee got a Roman I guess she has had a\nquestion in the last 5 or 10 minutes\nrepresentative ran is recognized for a\nquestion thank you Mr Speaker I can't do\nparliamentary inquiries so I got to make\nmyself do around here but um does it\ngentleman yield yes um so you had\nmentioned this bill has some bipartisan\nsupport but wouldn't you say that part\nof the reason that we are a bamal state\nis to allow for more vetting of bills so\nsometimes when one body doesn't catch\nsome things it is our job to\nunfortunately fix those\nproblems sure I don't know if that's a\nquestion but uh would you agree with\nthat sentiment I agree that the house\ngenerally does a fantastic job of\nimproving cability\ncorrect gentleman Yi representative\nKelly to your left has recognized for a\nquestion speaker with the gentleman\nyield yes sir representative isn't it\ntrue that you mentioned the 21,000\nchildren on the weight list now but\nisn't that drastically up in recent\nyears where it was just 14,000 just a\nfew years ago so we're seeing dramatic\nincreases in children wanting to come in\nthe Charter system it is I for me\nstanding here in this well again my\nultimate measure of local control is the\nparents and the parents have spoken with\ntheir feet and they are saying we\nbelieve and trust in charter schools\nwe'd like that as an option for our\nchildren and my posture is we need to\ngive those parents and those families\nthat choice and so um absolutely let's\nopen the doors let's not keep it closed\nto 21,000 students in our state thank\nyou representative\nBernell to your left is recognized for a\nquestion thank you Mr Speaker with a\ngentleman y yes is it not true that when\na student goes to a charter school the\nmon money that is at the current public\nschool goes with\nthem the money stays within the local\nsystem yes it goes to that charter\nschool with the student correct Money\nFollows the student yes okay can I ask\nyou another question sure okay so is it\nnot true that se uh Charter Schools fail\nbecause of lack of funding is that not\ntrue well Charter Schools like any\nschools fail for a number of reasons uh\nfunding being one of them the beauty of\na charter school unlike a traditional\npublic school is if a charter school is\nfailing we close it uh it is it has the\nultimate accountability measure that\nreally a traditional public school does\nnot\nhave can I ask you one more question one\nmore yes ma'am okay I'm from Detroit and\nuh Charter Schools came into Detroit and\nthey D they destroyed the entire Detroit\npublic\nschools well that's why we live in the\ngreat state of Georgia\nMr Speaker I know the gentleman has\nanother question if you'll take one more\nto kind of yes sir one more and that's\num representative Town said to your\nright down to Center is recognized for a\nquestion this gentleman yield it's my\nfellow education Committee Member yes\nsir isn't I too I ran a charge school\nfor approximately 10 years in brunic\nGeorgia very successful school because\nthe teacher and staff we got appropriate\nschool funding from local and state\nfunding and actually Federal funding as\nwell that school is still doing well\nturning out students who are going to\nhelp us with this Workforce Development\nproblem that we're have in the state of\nGeorgia so charge schools are effective\nif it's run effectively you're exactly\nright charter schools are public schools\nwho turn out the brightest Minds in our\nstate and with that Mr Speaker I ask\nyour favorable consideration on Senate\nBill 82 and I yield the well thank you\ngentlemen yielded the well we have\num three speakers on the bill I'm going\nto limit y'all to five minutes each up\nto five minutes each representative Lisa\nCampbell is recognized to speak to the\nbill then representative beckles then\nrepresentative Williams ladies\nrecognized we'll give the lady if the\nlady will suspend just for a\nminute thank you Mr Speaker\nproceed today my colleagues I rise in\nopposition strong opposition to SP sp82\na bill that is in direct opposition to\nthe original intention of charter\nschools this bill erodes local control\nin school boards across our state and\nmost importantly will further defund our\nPublic\nSchools this bill uses Financial\nincentives I'm not sure I've seen this\nbefore in our Public\nSchools it's akin to other types of\nfinancial deals that are Unworthy of\nthis\nbody sometimes called payoffs or\nkickbacks for local school boards to\napprove Charter Schools it's a punitive\nbill that penalizes elected school board\nmembers that deny petitions that are\nlater approved by the state and it\nimposes new oversight and Reporting\nobligations on local districts remember\nthis later when these same sponsors talk\nabout rolling back and getting rid of\nand necessary\nrules yes Charter Schools historically\nhave been an option in our Public School\nSystem but this bill is about align\nallowing private\nschools organizers who want to introduce\nreligious private\ncurriculum into our public school system\nand use our public tax dollars this new\nCharter School initiative is not the old\ncharter schools that you may be familiar\nwith the bottom line this is yet another\nbill that undermines local control of\nour Public School Systems it threatens\nand pressures School boards to approve\nCharter School applications against\ntheir best judgment these are elected\nofficials who have been asked to look at\nCharter Schools applying and are denying\nthem for very legitimate reasons this\nbill takes their elected responsibility\naway\ncompletely and not only does it usurp\ntheir elected responsibilities but it\npressures them to approve Charter School\napplications and lays the groundwork for\nincreased privatization of all all of\nour Public Schools this is cloaked in a\nton of language about Innovation and\nchoice but this bill ties funding and\nflexibility to the expansion of State\npreferred Charter options and threatens\nconsequences for school districts who\nchoose differently based on the needs in\ntheir school\ndistrict I can tell you about a charter\nschool in our\ndistrict it was denied at the local\nlevel but approved at the state level I\ncan tell you about this charter school\nthat trains its teachers and its\ncurriculum comes from Project\n1776 what we now know to be project 2025\nit is publicly known and our public tax\ndollars are going to support these\nschools this particular organization is\ncalled Hillsdale and they are on record\nwith a very strategic approach to take\nlegislatures like ours and essentially\ntrick them into talking about choice for\nparents\nbut I want to set the record straight\nwhat these private extreme far-right\nreligious organizations are doing is not\nright and we should\nnot fall into this trap of seeing the\nname of a bill labeled one thing but in\nactuality in reality stripping our tax\ndollars from our Public School Systems\nand in addition to the federal cuts the\ndismantling of our federal department of\neducation the growth expansion of our\nvoucher bill that now allows 2third of\nour students in Georgia to opt out of\npublic education do not act like you\nsupports public schools and sponsor and\nsay yes to this bill this bill is just\none more way to demonize our local\nteachers to defund our public schools\nand ultimately dismantle our Public\nSchools this bill creates a loss of\nlocal control its Charter expansion by a\ncoercion its backdoor\nprivatization and it Fosters unfed\nunfunded mandates and bureaucratic\nburdens ultimately it undermines public\nschool cohesion and\nplanning this bill has been framed as\nproviding school choice but once again\nit does nothing to address the proven\nand underlying causes of academic\nstruggle\npoverty we've spent zero minutes in this\nchamber talking about the ways to\nactually help our children I urge you\nall to vote no for this destructive Bill\nthank you and I yield The\nWell the lady has yielded the well\nrepresentative\nbeckles is recognized to speak to the\nbill representative\nbeckles thank you Mr Speaker colleagues\nI rise today with concerns about Senate\nBill\n82 this bill undermines local control of\nour schools it threatens to punish boys\nfor revoking their Charter system and it\ndenies Charter petitions later approved\nby the state the financial impact is\ntroubling this bill commits 250,000 per\nyear for three years for each new T of\nschool that's\n$750,000 per\nschool with our existing schools already\nstruggling for funding teacher pay and\nbuilding repairs can can we afford this\nadditional\nexpense this bill even admits\ninsufficient money saying grants will be\nreduced if funds run\nshort let's be clear What's Happening\nHere we are bribing our school districts\nto approve Charter Schools while\nthreatening\npenalties imagine a school board that\nreviews a charter petition and finds\nlegitimate problems with it under this\nbill they must either approve prove it\ndespite their concerns our risk\npenalties is that how we want decisions\nabout our schools um our children's\neducation this bill also creates our\nnecessary\npaperwork School boards must provide\ndetailed written statements within 20\ndays when denying a petition this\ncreates more administrative work for\nalready overloaded school systems\nmy most concern is how this bill treats\nCharter Schools differently than\ntraditional Public\nSchools while we demand strict\naccountability for our Public Schools\nthis bill focusing on only creating more\nCharter Schools without giving equal\nattention to their\nquality I for one believe in Innovation\nand choice in\neducation however the real Choice comes\nfrom Community needs not State\npressure this this bill represents a\ndangerous shift from local control\ntowards the state overriding local\ndecisions I urge you to vote against\nSenate Bill 82 and instead work on real\nreforms that respect local governance\nwhile improving education for all of\nGeorgia's students thank you Mr Speaker\nI yeld the\nwell lady as you of the well\nrepresentative Williams has recognized\nto speak the bill representative\nWilliams thank you Mr\nSpeaker I rise in opposition to S sp82\nbut for a little different reasons it's\nnot all bad there are a lot of good\npoints in this bill some of you will\nremember several years ago I was talking\nabout a bill and I describe I said no\nmatter what you do with a\nskunk if you spray it with Chanel Number\nFive when it wears off is still a\nskunk this is a skunk and skunks have\ngood use too they keep Ving down and you\ncan make a cap out of them but but it's\nstill a\nskunk and local control\nwhen I came to this these August halls\nin\n1975 lieutenant governor the Holy\nGrail was loc local control that was the\nHoly\nGrail\nnow I don't know whether it was into\nAnnie Smith or who but somebody stole\nthe Grail it's no longer a big thing and\nwe talk about the distinguished\ngentleman sponsored this bill whom I\nhave great respect for talks about the\npeople are saying this come on folk if\nyou listen to the people and here we\nhave voted on gaming 82% of the folks\nsaid let us vote but of course who are\nthey but voters who you will go home and\nlay another car game on because you\ndecided they didn't know anything now\nall of a sudden For the Love of the\nvoter we're going to save you again your\nsaving is very painful I went through a\nterrible episode a couple of weeks\nI had an upper respiratory infection and\nthank Dr Newton for saving my life\nbecause the Cure like to kill me the\nantibiotics were awful this cure will\nkill public education eventually and\nthat's the real\npurpose because when local control was\nin place and local control was the local\ncontrol we wanted it was fine\nbut as demographics\nchanged local control became a bad\nword you're taking money out of public\neducation when some teachers are having\nto buy\nsupplies to help the children because\nthey don't have the money the school\nsystem does not supply what they need\nthey go in their pockets but you've got\nmoney to build another chart at school\nand there are several very very\nsuccessful charter schools in Georgia\nthat were set up by\nlocals a lot of\nsuccessful it's worked most of you in\nhere products of public schools now all\nof a sudden it's\ndemonic nothing wrong with Public\nSchools something wrong is how we treat\nthem but don't let this skunk get out\nthe cage cuz you can't put him back in\none thing about a skunk he squirts\neverywhere he goes and you know he's\nbeen there and we about to turn him a\nloose on public education again let's\ndon't do that let's don't do it this is\nand and it also you remember back in the\nday when Muhammad Ali beat George\nForeman he beat him with the Rope a doe\nhe pretended to be being hit and he just\nducked and did the Rope a doe this is a\nRope A Dope a rope a doe this is a\npretend to help you but I don't plan on\nhelping you I'm plan on building some\nschools where poy and boo boos neighbors\nain't going to look the same in the very\nnear future don't do this to public\neducation it's an assault on public\neducation and please call it what it is\ndon't give it a fancy name say this is a\nwe don't like public education Bill call\nit that cuz that's what it's all about\nis not about anything else let's fund\npublic\neducation and then we can\nstop bragging one day if we concentrate\non public education about being the best\nstate to do business and say we're the\nbest state to do business and the best\nstate to get an education in let's do it\nlike that I talked a little longer than\nI wanted to but I know the speaker\nwanted to hear what I had to say with\nthat Mr Speaker I yield the well\nI'm glad you feeling\nbetter is there any objection to the\nprevious question in order\nheing none the previous question is\nordered we now have a minority report\nfor up to 20 minutes and the Chairman's\ntime for up to 20 minutes I'm going to\nrecognize whip Sam park for the first\ncomments whip Park you're going to\nmanage help everyone manage your time\nsir thank you very much whip Park is\nrecognized hold it suspend just for a\nminute gentlemen\nif any conversations need to go into the\nany rooms that' be the appropriate thing\nto\ndo whip Park recognized to speak to\nsb82 thank you Mr Speaker uh I rise in\nopposition to\nsb82 now you know I I know there have\nbeen strong comments against um this\npiece of legislation uh but you know for\nthe most part you know I'm open to the\nidea uh publicly funded Charter Schools\nespecially if they're able to provide\nInnovative quality programming\nprovided that they are formed with the\napproval of local Boards of Education\nbecause they are under the governance of\nthose local school boards so let me just\nhighlight some concerns with uh SP sp82\nwhich I do appreciate uh has been\nimproved uh but I think these are\nconcerns also shared uh with others\nincluding possibly uh the Georgia School\nBoard Association so let's begin first\non lines 104 to 142 uh these lines\nprovide for a punishment of loss of a\nDistrict's flexibility contract for\nschool districts with 10,000 students\nand above uh this currently applies to\n38 districts using the October 24 count\nthis punishment not only usurps local\ncontrol of those Constitution elected\nlocal school boards but it also does not\nencourage collaboration between a local\nCharter petitioner and the district\nthere is a fundamental difference\nbetween a state Charter and a local\nCharter a state Charter is an individual\nStandalone entity a local Charter is\npart of a school system and the Georgia\nConstitution empowers School boards to\nbe in control which this legislation\nundermines\nlocal school boards approve or deny\ncharters for various reasons common\nconsiderations include that a local\nCharter must be academically successful\nand fiscally sound a local Charter must\nfit in with the school district's\nMission strategic plan and goals there\nmust be a high level of trust in the\nmanagement and operations of the local\nCharter and that a local Charter should\notherwise fulfill unique needs that's\nthe first concern second on lines 155 to\n174 these lines provide for a\n$250,000 incentive for 3 years on August\n1st this is subject to Appropriations by\nthe legislature and can be reduced\nproportionally so the incentive grants\nare not guaranteed which makes planning\nwhich makes budget planning challenging\nfor local districts so while there is a\ncarrot if you want to call it a carrot\nin here it is much smaller than the\nstick especially when the incentive\ngrants are not otherwise guaranted\nand so again I I appreciate the intent\nof the bill uh but I I do not think that\nthe bill is yet perfect I think a lot of\nwork still has to happen in order to\nensure that we are respecting the\nGeorgia state constitution with respect\nto local control of locally approved\nCharter Schools as opposed to forcing\nlocal CH or local school districts to\naccept these Charter Schools uh by\nthreatening local school boards by\nremoving their flexibility which\ncertainly does also have financial\nimplications uh so for all those reasons\nI encourage members uh to vote no to\nSenate Bill 82 with the understanding\nthat the bill is not yet perfect uh\nhopefully we can come back around uh you\nknow sometime before the end of the bium\nto continue uh the work to really ensure\nthat this is a bipartisan piece of\nlegislation and really takes into\nconsideration especially the impact on\nlocal school districts uh so with all of\nthat said Mr Speaker I will now yield a\nportion of my time to representative\nJasmine Clark and then Karen Lupton uh\nfor the remainder of the minority Port\nthank you Mr Speaker y the wh gentleman\nas Yoda D wh represent Jasmine Clark is\nrecognized to speak to the bill\nrepresented\nClark thank you Mr speaker thank you\ncolleagues um so today I Rise with some\nstrong concerns about s SP 82 and I know\nit has been mentioned a couple of times\nbut I really want to hone in on lines\n148 through 165 of this bill and I\nspecifically want to hone in on lines\n159 through\n162 in the event that available\nAppropriations are not sufficient to\ncover the total amount of such incentive\ngrants provided for in this subsection\nthe amount of each sub Grant shall be\nreduced proportionally providing\nincentive grants and equal amounts to\neach such local Board of\nEducation in other words we are making\npromises that we not we may not be able\nto keep and I think that that is bad\npolicy it cost millions of dollars some\nestimate about $4\nmillion to start a new charter\nschool we are only promising a very\nsmall fraction of that initial startup\ncost even if we were uh promising even\nif we were able to keep our promise\nwe're basically saying we'll give you\nabout\n750k of millions of\ndollars but the problem is we have\nwritten a\num a a a way to back out of that promise\nwe are telling them you have to do this\nand we'll give you money to do it but if\nwe don't have enough money you may not\nget to this is kind of like offering a\nreward and then when you uh go and say\nall right I'm ready to receive the\nreward that you said you were going to\ngive me you say oh well my bank account\nis empty so can't give it to you now\nthat's a problem and again that is bad\npolicy and that is why I am asking you\nall to vote no on this bill if we are\ngoing to threaten people with penalties\nfor not um approving these\nCharters then we at least need to\npromise them that we're going to keep\nour end of the bargain thank you Mr\nSpeaker a y the well\nrepresentative lton I'm sorry I could I\ndidn't see you right\nnow my bad ladies recognized it's it's\nall right Mr speaker thank you we need\nto get an Apple box down here or\nsomething um colleagues I rise today in\nopposition of to\nsb82 um because I think that sb82 seeks\nto undermine the authority of our local\nelected School boards um I'm very\nfortunate to know many of the uh\nCommissioners on our decab Board of uh\nschool board and they work too hard to\nget elected and work too hard to try to\nmake great decisions for our kids um for\ntheir decisions about what's best for\ndecab County Schools to be overridden by\nthe state um especially with the\nlanguage and attit do bills have\nattitudes I think bills can have\nattitudes um as my previous um colleague\nspoke that these um carrots that we're\noffering are not\nguaranteed and although you look at the\ndollar amount and you think hey what\nschool wouldn't take\n$250,000 a year for three years like\ncome on guys wouldn't you do it the\nmoney in lines 166 to 170 the money\nclearly says this should just be spent\nby local school boards to get more\nCharter Schools you know you can hire an\nadmin you can get some real you know get\nsome better evaluators but it all has to\nbe spent making and sustaining more\nCharter Schools it's not like you get\nmoney for an Innovative writing program\nor something like that you that's not\nthe way this bill is written um and what\nyou're taking away from them is some of\nthe ways that our Public Schools try to\nbe try to meet specialized needs and try\nto be Innovative which is those waivers\nthose local waivers they say hey we get\nit State you need us to do this but\nactually we have some different needs in\nour district can we use this money for\nthis that's a great way that public\nschools can be flexible but you want to\nthreaten to take that away if they don't\ngive you the charter schools that the\nstate wants the state can make Charter\nSchools if the state would like Charter\nSchools the state can get charter\nschools but I trust my local District to\nunderstand especially the budget in our\nschool in my school district to\nunderstand whether that can be the best\nanswer for\nus call me stupid but I just trust the\npeople that I elected that I help that\nwe um trust to run our Public Schools um\nnow over 30 this is just a real rough\nestimate I counted you know going\nthrough our our uh the legislative\nwebsite I counted just about over 30 uh\nprincipally Democratic bills relating to\nState education public education we're\ntrying to cover everything from school\nsafety we're trying to cover feeding\nkids at school we're talking about\nrevamping the QBE based on what was what\nwas uh suggested in 2015 after a big\nstate committee um we're talking about\nappropriating money for more Mental\nHealth Providers we're talking about we\nsaw we heard a bill here about\nInnovative writing programs like right\nwe passed it through here those are over\n30 principally Democratic bills that\nattend to the needs of our public\nschools are we hearing any of them right\nnow no we're talking about siphoning off\nmore money from public schools to give\nthem to\nCharters um now our education\nsubcommittee our education committee um\nI'm I really am proud of the work that\nwe did um under the leadership of our\nchair um he when he called us into order\nfor the first very first committee\nmeeting he said that we have\ntwo two primary goals one is safety and\none is literacy and boy we have been\nattacking literacy we have come up with\nsome great ideas and we're making a push\nwe're throwing our legislative weight\nbehind changes to literacy to make a\ndifference in every Public School in\nGeorgia I feel\nlike at well this bill doesn't have\nanything to do with safety it doesn't\nhave anything to do with\nliteracy what I feel like we could do is\nthat if\nwe put our legislative might\nto making Georgia's public\nschools Second To\nNone we could do that if we put our mind\nto it would it be difficult yes we're\nnot scared of hard work instead of\nsiphoning off a couple couple's kids\nhere couple kids here giving them more\nmoney per student more less students per\nteacher boy if we only we could make our\nPublic Schools the xanado do that some\nCharter schools claim to be now I have a\ngreat Charter actually in my district\nit's called the PATH Academy and it um\nserves mostly Latino kids um with\nSpanish speaking parents they have a\nwonderful atmosphere they're\ngreat they're not meeting their academic\nstandards so they are being held to an\naccountability they are having um some\nissues but what we need more than\nthreats and more\nwhat's the word I'm searching\nfor more um layer of Bureau of\nbureaucracy at our Public Schools I'm\ninterested in trying to take a burden\noff of our Public Schools so that they\ncan be free to do what what else we're\nasking them to like change their\nliteracy and do many other important\nthings in the classroom for millions and\nmillions of kids um I'm proud of the the\nbills that my fellow Democrats have um\nhave dropped and you know some of them\nhave have been uh bipartisan but um this\nbill oh hold\non yeah we should be making it easier\nfor our local school districts to focus\non the special needs that they have for\ntheir for their students if we can get\nthem the care and the training and the\nschooling that they need where they live\neven better and we can do that we have\nthe tools to do that we have not the\nwill yet but I hope that we that I hope\nthat we can develop that um this this\nlegislation is primarily about uh\nfocusing um forcing a specific political\nagenda onto local communities once as\nanother gentleman said our local\ncommunities aren't doing what the state\nwants them to do uh regardless of the\nvoter's\nwishes it's s sp82 fails to address the\nlarger more pressing issues in Georgia\nGeorgia's public education system our\nPublic Schools need increased\ninvestments in teachers infrastructure\nand student Support Services they need\nsmaller class sizes they need\ncompetitive salaries to attract and\nretain highquality Educators they need\nadequate resources for students with\nspecial\nneeds instead of focusing on these\ncritical issues SBA 8 2 diverts\nattention and funding away from some of\nthose very beneficial policies at the\nbenefit of a few and the expense of the\nmajority I talk with my hands a whole\nlot additionally this bill forces local\nschool districs to stretch their already\nlimited budgets even further so when a\nnew charter school is approved it\ndoesn't just receive funding it siphons\nmoney away from the local public school\nthat's there it weakens the ability of\nour traditional public schools to serve\ntheir all of their students effectively\ncreating inequities that hurt the\ncommunities that we claim to\nsupport now public schools are subject\nto rigorous oversight transparency\nrequirements and state standards that\nensure students receive a high quality\neducation charter schools on the other\nhand can sometimes operate with less\noversight and again they are not\ngoverned by people that the people\nliving in that District have elected\nthey've elected somebody to stand up and\nmake decisions for them that's their\nlocal school\nboard so sb82 to me is not about Choice\nit's about coercion it pressures local\nboards into decisions that may not align\nwith their students best interests it\nforces them into difficult Financial\nsituations while while burdening them\nwith new mandates to drain time and\nresources\nthis is not responsible\npolicymaking this is a blatant attempt\nto override our local control in\nfavor of an approach dictated top down\nby the state colleagues I urge you to\nconsider the consequences of this bill\nby passing s sp82 we're sending a\nmessage that we don't trust our local\nschool boards right they've been elected\nbut no no no no no Daddy knows best the\nstes coming in and going to tell you\nwhat you need to do with your with your\nwith your money and with your\nstudents we are sending a message that\nwe prioritize political pressure over\nthe actual needs of our students we're\ntelling communities that their voices\ndon't matter if their voices are their\nvotes their votes are not mattering\nbecause we just want to toss aside the\nfolks that are sitting and making\ndecisions at the local\nlevel this is not how we build a strong\nsustainable public education\nsystem let's reject sb82 let's stand up\nfor the right of local districts to make\ntheir own\ndecisions we may not always agree with\nthem but they are the ones whove been\nelected to stand in that place and make\nthat decisions make those decisions let\nus support policies that are truly going\nto empower our Educators and\nadministrators and families and perhaps\nlessen the burden on them instead of\nconstantly adding on I met with some\nfolks from the uh education from the\nGeorgia Department of Education and\nasked them you know kind of a very\nsimple question what can we start doing\nto take things off the plates of\nteachers in public schools what can we\ndo and we had a very productive talk\nthey showed me some lovely websites some\nreally great websites um that the state\nhas has created to provide resources for\nteachers but then they told me that oh\nit's the locals that are really\noverburdening your the schools with all\nof this regulation it's really the local\ndistricts that are doing this\nthis I mean come on this is the state\nsaying no no no no no we're going to\npile on more we continue to ask for\nblood from a stone and we're not going\nto get it instead of allowing our public\nschools to kind of die on the\nvine as as I said before we have so much\npower here to change the narrative and\nto change the way we approach public\nschool for our\nstudents we have the power to do that\ninstead of cherry-picking that we want a\ncouple out for special over here and a\ncouple that are special over here why\ndon't\nwe try to give the best of our resources\nto every single\nschool every single public\nschool no okay nobody's\ninterested uh thank you thank you I I\nappreciate that shout out um a gentleman\nfrom the 49th spoke the other day thank\nyou so\nmuch um to another education Bill and\nurged us to look at our state's QBE\nformula in total to prep ourselves to\nwork towards the review and reworking of\na very complicated QBE formula I cannot\nagree more with the gentleman from the\n49th if things are getting tough in our\npublic education space we're the ones\nwho have the power to fix it we can\nreview our QBE we can do the hard work\nof finding the support for each and\nevery one of our Public Schools instead\nof rescuing a few I mean\nschools are not they're not businesses\nit's not seral like you don't you go\ninto a Serial aisle you got 150 choices\nfor serial how many choices do we\nneed now I understand that we have some\num some great Charter Schools as I said\none of them is in my district uh but\nplease vote no on 82 let's find a way to\nsupport all all of our local public\nschools thank you Mr Speaker\nare I love those choices on the serial\naisle I go ah and tell you that\nnow that completes all those they were\nspeaking to The Minority Report now\nwe'll he hear the chair's time I don't\nsee the chair so I'm going to recognize\nthe vice chair of the committee on\neducation to speak to the bill\nrepresentative\nrice thank you Mr Speaker I would like\nto wave the entirety of my time to\nspeaker Pro Tim Jones at this time thank\nyou the vice chair has waved the chair's\ntime and giv all the allocated time to\nthe protim of this house representative\nJan Jones representative Jones is\nrecognized thank you Mr Speaker I don't\nneed 20 minutes I'm I'm the lucky pinch\nheader for the chairman who is\nnegotiating feverishly to get us a\nschool safety Bill uh with the Senate\nand so he asked asked me a few minutes\nago if I would just come up and say a\nfew words I just want to say that um for\nthe 20 or so years that I've been here\nwe've been talking about charter schools\nand particularly locally approved\ncharter schools and in that time very\nlittle progress has been made uh the\nfirst Charter School bill was initiated\nby former Democrat representative Kathy\nAsh\nand since that time we we've seen some\nprogress particularly in areas like the\ncity of Atlanta there's some uh very um\nthey're locally approved charter schools\ndoing great work around the state but\nit's very few what this bill does is\nsimply it's a very Modest\nProposal uh to encourage local school\nboards to provide more Public School\noptions to students and it's so that we\ncan have public more public charter\nschools\nemploying Public School\nteachers in that are included in the\nstate retirement p teachers retirement\nplan State Health Benefit Plan and\nteaching public school students in the\nlast 10 years of all these efforts to\nencourage public authorization by local\nschool boards guess how many they've\napproved in 10 years three\nthree um the state on the other hand has\napproved 56 in that time period some of\nyou were here when your voters um\napproved the cha State Charter School\nAmendment it passed by 58% around the\nstate the county that approved it at the\nhighest percent in the entire state was\nClayton County at\n71% why because parents and students\nwhich I haven't heard a lot of today up\nhere in the well mostly heard about\nsystems districts school boards I I\nthink I could probably count on two\nfingers the number of times I heard\nstudents and parents which is what this\nis aimed at\num we we've approved them at the state\nlevel parents around the state\ngrandparents around the state approved\nthe state Charter School Amendment\nbecause they don't care about your\nconstruct they want Public School\nchoices they want to attend public\nschools with public school teachers\nutilizing state and local\ndollars I heard a lot about vouchers\nreligious schools privatization none of\nthat is in the spell all public charter\nschools have a nonprofit\nboard and they um there is no private in\nthe nonprofit\nboard they um\nyou know I heard about vouchers the bill\nhas nothing to do about vouchers and let\nme just make a\ncorrection 2third of our state cannot\nutilize vouchers because there's 1.7\nmillion students and vouchers can only\nbe utilized by 21,000 students per the\nbill we passed last year uh backdoor\nprivatization is a non-issue these are\npublic charter\nschools public dollars remain in public\nschools whether they're public charter\nschools or traditional\nschools um I've heard over the 20 years\nI've been here that folks are open to\nthe idea I heard that open to the idea\nof public charter\nschools as long as they're under the\ngovernance of public school boards then\nyou ought to be for this bill because\nthis bill encourages local\nauthorization we got a lot of State\nauthorization going on we're kind of\nfull up there what we need are locally\napproved charter schools and you know uh\nopen to the idea usually when I hear\nthat it doesn't mean supportive I'll\njust say that but I read The Minority\nReport I don't know where the 2 million\n4 million comes from I'll just I'll just\nsay this when you have a locally\napproved Charter\nSchool the property tax dollars that are\nraised for the students that live in\nthat school district stay stay there and\nthey follow the child to the charter\nschool they earn QBE when the state\nauthorizes a public charter school and\nthat might be where the misunderstanding\ncame about with the dollars the state's\non the hook for both sides of the\nequation we pay for the local share an\nequivalent and we pay for QBE well it's\njust not\nsustainable nor replicable around the\nstate to keep offering the options that\nyour constituents your students and your\nparents want to have them all approved\nat the state level it just isn't because\nthat's not how public education is\ngenerally funded in the state it's a\npartnership about 10% comes from the\nfeds 40% from the locals and 50% from\nthe state so if we collectively want to\nencourage more public charter schools we\nneed to figure figure out a way and this\nis a very modest proposal to do that uh\nto encourage more locally approved but\nin 10 years three have been approved\nthere are over 20,000 students on the\nwaiting list for those few that exist\nnow imagine how many would be on how\nmany more can't get on a wait list\nbecause there's no charter school to get\non the weight list for it's kind of like\nprek when I hear about the weit list for\npre it's irrelevant if there's no class\nthere waiting to get on a wait list for\nI don't know how many would want to be\nin public prek well the same is true for\npublic charter schools and I I encourage\nyou to vote for this I I do have to\naddress several folks mentioned that the\nmoney isn't\nguaranteed you know one legislature\ncannot legally bind a future\nlegislature the only way to is is to put\nan appropriation in a tax credit or tax\ndeduction and until you repeal that the\nrecipient is due that tax credit or tax\nuh deduction anything we pass on this\nfloor saying we're going to do this loan\ngrant program we're going to do that\ngrant program we're going to do these\nmodest incentives to local school\ndistricts to approve Local Schools is\nall always subject to appropriation\nthat's not being an Indian giver that's\nhow the state constitution works so do\nkeep that in mind on future issues that\nit it's nothing different than\neverything we pass whether it's a uh a\nloan program for public school teachers\nor for fallen heroes it's always due to\nappropriation some of you were here\nduring the Great Recession\nwe had to cut back and cut back and make\ncutbacks and again that's why we have we\nwe cannot bind a future leg uh future\nlegis uh legislature so I encourage you\nto vote for\nstudents and parents who are begging for\nmore options this is not vouchers if you\ndidn't like vouchers and you're for\npublic schools and public education only\nthis should be appealing to you and if\nyou like local control and you want more\nlocally approved Charter Schools you\nshould like this bill because it is a\nvery Modest Proposal with very minor um\nI guess you could say penalties or\ninducements to encourage public charter\nschools and with that Mr Speaker I do\nask that you vote for this bill and I do\nyield the well thank you\nlady has yielded the well that\ncompletes the Chairman's\ntime and that completes our comments on\nthe bill is there any objection to\nadopting The committee's Substitute\nhearing none

Development\nAuthority of North Fulton municipalities\nthis bill have referred to the committee\non intergoal coordination that committee\nrecommends this bill D pass by committee\nsubstitute Pro Tim Jan Jones is\nrecognized\nto speak to Senate Bill 151\nrepresentative Jones Thank you Mr speak\nMr Speaker this bill is completely\ndifferent from the bill that came over\nfrom the Senate um I took that bill out\nand constructed something regarding the\nfolon county Development Authority that\nthe county is neutral on all of the\nnorth Fon Mayors um support it and and\num I worked also with the Fulton County\nDevelopment Authority the the bill the\nlegislation only affects Fulton County\nthose of you who've been around have\nseen we've done a number of bills like\nthis over the years particularly since\n2005 when the C the county started\nmunicipalization and is now completely\nmunicipalization area\nin the county um what the bill does is\nit allows the six North Fulton cities by\nresolution to opt out of the Fulton\nCounty development Authority's ability\nto offer property tax incentives I\nnarrowed the bill up I took it back to\ncommittee a second time to incorporate\nsome language from The Fulton County\nDevelopment Authority\nchairman um to make it more palatable to\nthem what's happened is we have two\nLegacy cities in North fton who have\ntheir own Development Authority and uh\nthey do not necessarily want to compete\nwith another Development Authority I did\nnot include the other nine cities in\nFulton County because I I don't\nrepresent them and I uh some of them\nhave expressed interest in similar\nlegislation next year and I would\nsupport that but um I wanted to leave\nthat up to the legislators who\num I didn't know what all nine cities\nwould want and I wanted to leave that up\nto them to make um the best decision for\nthem uh the reason it's General law and\nnot local law is because uh Development\nAuthority is contained in general law so\nto make a change like this to allow\ncities to opt out it had to be General\nlaw um I had a similar Bill a number of\nyears ago that separated the city of\nAtlanta from the rest of Folton County\nbecause the city of Atlanta wanted\nto uh increase their Marta sales tax by\n50 Cent or 50% and so it made it work\nbetter for the entire County to allow\nthem to do that uh independent of the\nrest of Fon County and the rest of\nFulton County had a higher percentage\nfor a te blast which seemed to be more\num desired by the cities in South fton\nand in North Fulton uh I did delay the\nimplementation until January 2026 to\nallow the Fon County Development\nAuthority to work with the different\ncities I have no reason to believe the\ncities will or will not opt out but uh\nI'll leave that to their decision making\nI will say this it is currently and in\nthe future if a city opts out of the\nFulton County Development Authority and\nthey choose later to opt back in they\nwould have that right I didn't need to\nspecifically mention that in the bill\nbecause a current city council cannot\nobligate uh a future city council on a\ndecision such as that with this I'd be\nhappy to take any\nquestions the lady has no questions well\nthank you and with that I would\nappreciate your uh favorable vote on um\nthis Bill thank\nyou ladies yielded well we have a couple\nof folks who want to speak they're\nopposed I'm going to ask them to hold it\nto five minutes or less if you will and\nso we have two speakers the first will\nbe representing park Canon has\nrecognized to speak to senate bill1\nrepresentative Canon\nand give the lady your attention please\nthank you Mr speaker thank you members I\nrise today in opposition to this\nlegislation sitting as the chair of the\nFulton County delegation we have had\nover 10 meetings this legislative\nsession to which we have discussed\nmeasures that have impacted or could\nhave impact on Fulton County and have\nrequested that the stakeholders come\nbefore us and let us know um on our last\nmeeting we actually had this bill Senate\nBill 151 on our bad legislation list and\nwe're pretty surprised to um see it\nsitting here today um because of the\nconcerns that we have had that\nultimately the parties involved were\napproached and told I'm doing something\nand you either get along with it or you\ndon't and then came back around to our\ndelegation and said well you know folks\nare actually okay with it and so again\nthis is that local bill should have been\na local Bill impacts all 15 cities in\nFulton County and Fulton County has not\nbeen asked now I will say that the\nFulton County external Affairs\ndepartment is neutral on this bill but\nthat's only because they don't have a\nmeeting until Wednesday to which they\ncan look at this new version of this\nlegislation um you\nknow this is like you have a bucket you\ntell somebody you have a bucket\neverybody can put something in the\nbucket and then you say you know what\nI've decided I'm taking this bucket away\nbut I'm going to give a few cups and if\nyou want to put some things in those\ncups good for you if you don't well then\njust too bad um delaying the\nimplementation date again it's not\nsomething that is to the benefit of\nthese cities that used to have a bucket\nand now might be able to opt in or out\nof a cup I ask that you vote in\nopposition to this bill there's more\nwork to be done and respectfully the\nPower Players the individuals impacted\nby this they should be asked how they\nfeel about it thank you Mr Speaker I\nyel ladies yielded the\nwell we had one more speaker but she\nwaves we have one speaker in favor and\nI'm going to recognize chairman Martin\nspeaking in favor of the bill up to no\nlonger than five minutes at the most sir\num thank you Mr Speaker uh let me just\nspeak uh if I can to to Senate Bill 151\nand let me do this because people come\nto the well and they say things because\nthey say things I guess they think\nthey're true this is General\nbill this affects General law therefore\nit's a general bill it's the general\nbill that's all there is about that and\nwhat this bill does is is it allows the\ncities in North Fulton and as the\nprotim\num spoke it could allow the cities in\nSouth Fulton if they choose to next year\nit allows them to have the say as to\nwhat Development Authority can work in\ntheir City doesn't keep them from\nworking with the Fon County Development\nAuthority doesn't stop them from doing\nit at all does not stop them from\nworking with that they can opt by\nresolution to not allow them to do it\nand then later they can opt back to\nallow them to do it again so we hear a\nlot about local control and taking\nthings away from people this takes\nnothing away from any city in North\nFulton it takes nothing away from the\nfton county Development Authority that\nthe cities want to have happen so I I\nwould just stand here before you today\nthis is a general law it comes forward\nto us for our our vote because it\naffects um Development Authority\nlanguage in the general code section and\nthe cities in North fton support this\nbecause it gives them local control\nwithin their M Municipal bounds and I\nask members let let's don't make this a\npartisan issue this is a local control\nissue for the people in North Fon this\nyear and as the sponsor of the bill said\nshould the folks in South Fon want to do\nthis next year I stand with them and\nwould support them and doing so I hope\nyou will support the members in North\nFulton and by that I mean the city\nmembers in North Fulton in passage of\nSenate Bill 151 I yield the\nwell gentlemen as yield of the will that\ncompletes our discussion on Senate Bill\n1550\n1 is there any objection to the previous\nquestion being ordered hearing none of\nthe previous questions ordered is there\nany objection to adopting The\ncommittee's Substitute hearing none The\ncommittee's Substitute is adopted is\nthere any objection to agreeing to the\nreport of the committee which was\nfavorable to the passage of the bill\nhearing none report the committee is\nagreed to shall this bill now pass all\nthose in favor of the passage of the\nbill we'll vote Yes all those opposed\nwill vote no and Mr clerk will you\nunlock the machine\nhave all members\nvoted all members voted for what purpose\ndid representative Derek Jackson\nrice no no I have the question for the\nhe\nWS he WS all members voted if so Mr\nclerk will you lock the machine on the\npassage of Senate Bill 151 the Y's are\n101 the Nays are 63 this bill har see\nthe requisite constitutional majority is\ntherefore\npassed Mr clerk will you read the\ncaption the Senate Bill 212 212 212\nSenate Bill 212 by Senator distill of\nthe 48th and others to be entitled an\nact to amend part 14 article 6 chapter 2\nTitle 20 of the official code of Georgia\nannotated relating to other educational\nprograms under the quality basic\neducation act so as to prohibit the\ndisclosure of public student directory\ninformation to P political candidates\ncampaign committees political action\ncommittees this bill have referred the\ncommittee on education that committee\nrecommend this bill do pass by committee\nsubstitute chairman Todd Jones is\nrecognized to present Senate Bill\n212 thank you Mr\nSpeaker members I come to you with the\nhouse substitute of Senate Bill 212 we\nhave spoken about two different bills\ntoday have spoke about student safety\nmaking sure that we are protecting the\nsanctity of the child and 212 I think\nspeaks to that completely because\nfrankly I was surprised that furpa or\ncurrent law did not already cover this\nbecause this is effectively the contact\ndata of a\nstudent Senate Bill 212 does two\nimportant things the first thing it does\nis it prohibits a school district from\nbasically transferring that child's\ninformation to a campaign a candidate or\na\npack the second thing it does is that\nunder the cloak of I'll say legitimacy\nwe have\nseen organizations go into K12\ninstitutions we're talking about K12\nhave gone in under the opes of\neffectively going in for registration to\nvote getting that data and trans ing it\nto a campaign or a\npack we must protect our children we\nmust protect that data this bill does\nthose two\nthings it does something else that's\nvery important and I want to say thank\nyou to the minority party they added in\nan\nexception in section one that\nensures that we can for legitimate\nreasons with the permission of the\nschool of course which I think any of us\ngo into K12 institutions we can go there\nto basically have a registration to vote\nwe can go there to ensure that they are\nsigning up for their Selective Service\nwe can go there for a town hall again\nwith the approval of the principal or\nthe appropriate person within the school\nthat's found within lines 42 to\n55 I appreciate the thoughtfulness of\nnot just a majority party but also\nminority party on this because we're\ntalking about data we're talking about\ndata of minors and we must at all times\nput a protective shield over these\nindividuals to ensure that their\ninformation is not getting out\nespecially for nefarious\npurposes we talk all the time about is\nthere a problem there is in 20124 this\nexact issue occurred in Gwinette Fulton\nand foresight County Schools we had\ninstances of a campaign doing an o r for\npublic records to the school\nof 9th through 12th graders for those\nwho do not know going into 9th you can\nstill be 13 years old 14 years old\ntrying to obtain that data through a\npublic records\nrequest a campaign also went into high\nschools in those same three school\ndistricts acting as if they were there\nto register to vote help these\nindividuals who are 17 to register to\nvote when in fact it was there or they\nwere there to collect the data of these\nminers to transfer to a candidate's\ndatabase and potentially into a\npack I ask each of you to\nconsider that during the debate over the\nlast couple of bills we spoke a lot\nabout student safety we talked about\nmaking sure that our children are\nprotected this in fact is a common sense\npiece of legislation that ensures that\nthe good actors are in fact good actors\nand those Bad actors we are throwing\nover them a shield to say no we're going\nto protect our Miners and make sure that\ntheir data stays with them Mr Speaker\nthat's a completion of my summary and\nI'll yield for any questions gentleman\nhas a couple of questions representative\nJasmine Clark to your left is recognized\nfor a\nquestion thank you Mr Seer does the\ngentleman\nyield yes representative um I want to\ncall your attention to um line 92 and 93\num it speaks to um having uh candidates\num quote solicit individuals under 18 to\nfraudulent fraudulently organize an\nevent what do you mean by that like can\nyou expound on how someone would\nfraudulently organize an event yes\nrepresentative Clark it goes to my last\nexample we know that a campaign went\ninto for instance fory County Schools\nunder the aaces of a registration to\nvote when in fact the data of the miners\nwas taken in by that campaign and then\ntransferred into a c a c a candidate's\ndatabase so what we wanted to be able to\ndo in '92 through pardon me 100 was to\nensure that we wanted to object to\novertly any type of fraudulent\nactivities that would occur in the k\nthrough2 space especially as it retains\nto those individuals data does it\ngentleman further yield yes\nrepresentative so um I understand what\nyou mean that we want to make sure to\nprotect our students I also have a\nstudent in high school and I definitely\nwant her to be protected I guess what\nI'm concerned about is how are we\ndefining which events are fraudulent or\nwhich ones are not and how do we make\nsure that this doesn't stop groups from\ncoming in and doing voter registration\ndrives in our high schools which I think\nis very important yes representative and\nagain that's why I I called out the\nminority party and we appreciate the\npartnership in creating this bill lines\n42 through 55 speak through exactly what\nyou're asking on the latter part of your\nquestion which is if you go to lines 42\nthrough 45 you will see that we want\nwhat you just said and turn the\nregistration to vote 46 through 47 talks\nabout selective service and then what 48\nthrough 55 does is effectively say that\nyou're a testing and writing that you\nare here for legitimate purpose you have\ninformed the school of that legitimate\npurpose and you have committed to not\nand I want to be clear actively not\ntransfer to a candidate a pack or a\ncampaign so g a tiny\nquestion I'm sorry yes and I'll try to\ndo a tiny answer yes thank you um so a\nlot of times when they do the voter\nregistration they some groups use like\nan app to do it with this prevent them\nfrom being able to use those apps for\nthat purpose again I would say would not\nprevent the app as long as they attest\nto and follow what hopefully will be a\nstatute that they are not transferring\nthat data to the campaign the candidate\nor to the pack thank you you're welcome\nthose tiny questions and answers are\neliciting more questions I can tell you\nthat so uh let's see how about\nrepresentative dubnick chairman dubnick\nyou got something going to add to this\nthank you Mr recognized will the\ngentleman yield yes sir Mr chairman is\nit not true that by\nprohibiting um the disclosure of this\nstudent data that we are taking further\nsteps to um control and protect their\nindividualized personal data so that\nthat's not released to the general\npublic as well I think the chairman is\nexactly correct that's a one of the one\nof the aims of this bill is to ensure\nthat that Minor's data remains the\nresponsibility of the minor and of\ncourse the parent are the guardian so\nthank you very much for the question\nthank you Mr chairman great Bill\ngentleman has numerous other questions\nand we have about five or six seven\nspeakers that make it bring some clarity\nto this\ndeal but I'll give you another question\nrecognize one if you'd like no Mr\nSpeaker given the number of question I\npardon me the number of speakers and the\ntime of the day I'm going to go ahead\nand yield the yield the well and ask for\nyour farewell\nconsideration thank you good job\ngentleman has yielded the\nwell let's see we have um\nabout five speakers that are opposed to\nSenate Bill\n212 I'm going to give you four minutes a\nMax absolute Max of five minutes each\nhope y'all can hold it to four minutes\nor\nless that would be awful awesome not\nawful\nawesome you know what I meant so we're\ngoing to recognize representative Barry\nand representative Barnes your on Deck\nrepresentative Barry has recognized the\ngentleman recognized for up to 5\nminutes thank you Mr Speaker um I rise\ntoday in opposition to Senate Bill\n212 because it is no secret that I'm the\nyoungest person in this chamber the\nmedia has heral long about how I and the\ngentleman from the 42nd are the first\ngenen Z Representatives because of that\nI am someone who has lived through the\nvery struggles this bill seeks to deepen\nmy back is different from a lot of you\nI'm someone who has organized who has\nmarched and who has fought for the\nvoices of this bill that seeks to\nsilence I don't use silence lightly\nbecause there are some bills that we\nhave passed this session with hopefully\nunintentional harms but SP sp212 doesn't\ntry to mask it it is about power it is\nabout fear it is about silencing a\ngeneration that is standing up and\ndemanding change this bill is a direct\nattack on the rights of young people of\nblack and brown students of firsttime\nVoters and I will not stand by while\nthose in power attempt to script them of\ntheir voice their vote and their future\nI'm a math teacher but allow me to give\nyou a history lesson the day is May 3rd\n1963 children as young as five and six\nyears old to those 16 17 18 walk out of\nschool to March the\nstreets to demand freedom and\nopportunity they didn't March in\nunfamiliar territory they marched on\ntheir own streets streets where they\nworshiped streets where they played\nstreets where they spent time and money\nand what happened on this day on these\nstreets an authoritarian who wanted to\nsilence them and their Fight For Freedom\nreleased dogs and water hoses on\nchildren over 1,000 children were\narrested that day some of you in this\nchamber probably remember that day those\nimages that only happened because Dr\nKing understood the benefit and the\npower of the young voice he reached out\nto young people because he understood\ntheir hunger had sp212 been in effect\nthen he would have been in jail a moment\nthat changed history and the course of\nthis nation as we know it would have\nnever happened if this Bill had been\neffect I've seen the hearings and read\nthe bill thoroughly and through and\nthrough there are so many lies behind\nthis bill SP sp212 does not protect\nstudents it protects politicians who are\nterrified of the power young voters hold\nthis legislature has no power problem\nwith schools handing student data over\nto military recruiters no problem with\ncorporations using student data and\ninformation to sell them credit cards\nand Loans or other predatory products\nbut the moment the moment the same\ninformation is used that can help a\nstudent register to vote suddenly we\nneed privacy protections this bill is\nnot about privacy it's about stopping\nstudents from organizing mobilizing and\nturning out to vote in record numbers\njust as they have before and as they\nwill again so we've seen the Playbook\nbefore every time young people\nespecially young black and brown voters\nturn out in record numbers the rules\nsuddenly change and every time the\njustification is the same some vague IL\ndefined fraudulent event that no one can\nquite explain but somehow demands urgent\nlegislative action let's be real what\nexactly is this fraudulent event when\ndid it happen who was responsible\nwhere's the proof you would think that\nif something so serious actually\noccurred we'd be getting specific\ndetails and names and dates and evidence\nbut instead we get this legislative\nequivalent to the trust me bro in this\nto March Madness it's like someone\nclaiming they lost the basketball game\nbecause of bad calls without pointing to\na single replay if you can't tell us\nwhat actually happened maybe just maybe\nit didn't and yet here we are again\ndebating a bill that claims to address a\nproblem that does not exist sp sp 212\ntakes real tangible steps to limit Civic\nengagement based on an imaginary threat\nit makes it harder for student Le\norganizations to connect with their\nelected officials officials the same\nofficials they may have soon have the\npower to replace it restricts access to\nvoter education efforts based on nothing\nmore than a whispered rumor of\nwrongdoing so I ask my colleagues are we\nreally going to write laws based on\nghost stories are we really going to\ncontinue to act like democracy is under\nattack just because some people don't\nlike who's participating in it because\nif we keep moving this direction we\nwon't just be solving a problem that\ndoesn't exist we'll be creating a real\nrun a government that legislates based\non myths instead of facts is far more\ndangerous to democracy than any\nso-called fraudulent event could ever be\nwith that Mr Speaker i y the well\ngentleman is yielded the well the chair\nrecognizes representative Barnes to\nspeak to the\nBill thank you madam\nspeaker I stand in opposition to sb12\nwhile I support some of it there are\nsome problems in the bill that I feel\nlike we need to address um while the\nintent on sb12 may be to protect student\ninformation and prevent inapo\ninappropriate political activity its\nunintended consequences could limit\nCivic engagement for these uh youth\ncreate legal\nconfusion uh burden schools and reduce\nopportunities for for some students and\nespecially those in uh underresourced\ncommunities while B\nsb212 is presented as a measure to\nprotect student privacy and uphold\nelection Integrity it raises several\nconcerns and potential disadvantages for\nsome students one major issue is that it\nmay discourage voter engagement it may\ndiscourage our young voters from voting\nit's it's hard to get them to the polls\nas it is and with uh some type of\nloophole that it could just discourage\nthem all the way around\nby requiring individuals who help\nstudents register to vote or sign up for\nthe selected service to sign written\nwaivers and comply with new rules this\ncould also deter these young individuals\nfrom wanting to vote this is is\nespecially troubling giving that young\npeople already face barriers to Civic\nengagement as we are making it hard for\nthem to protest on campus um they\nalready have barriers so we are\nactually implementing more\nbarriers this bill's prohibitions on\nsharing student directory\ninformation uh with political entity\nentities could also restrict important\nforms of political speech so we could be\nshutting these children's speech down as\nwell it does not distinguish between\npartisan campaigns and educational\nOutreach efforts so if uh the military\nwas coming into to the schools to um try\nto recruit these students that's okay\nand their information is okay to be\nshared in that aspect but not this\naspect it doesn't distinguish between\nthose two it could unintentionally\nprevent students from receiving\ninformation about issues that directly\nimpact their lives so we could be\nshutting down uh the ability for them to\ngain information information on other\nissues such as school funding and voting\nrights or Public Safety this raises the\nrisk that schools become more isolated\nfrom the broader Civic\nlandscape additionally like all my other\ncolleagues were saying that fraud\nfraudulently organizing an event and\nunauthorized Personnel persons is not\nclearly defined so I feel like we need\nto define those uh more clearly as\nwell and sb212 could have dis\ndisproportionate impact on students and\nmarginalized communities who um um\nSchool serving lowincome rural or\nminority students often rely on external\norganizations for civic education and\nOutreach so this could put a barrier on\nthat as well by restricting these\nPartnerships the bill could reduce\naccess to these critical resources for\nthese marginalized\ncommunities student data is you\nroutinely shared to with thirdparty\nvendors for educational technical\ncompanies for military recruiters as I\nsaid earlier yet this legislation does\nnot include measures to regulate that or\nprotect against those forms of data\nsharing while I know we're tired of\nlistening to all of us speak I just want\nto reiterate that this does not protect\nstudents from uh as much as we think it\ndoes it actually puts a barrier and a\nburden on our students so I hope that we\nrethink this and put this back to do\nsome more work on this s sp212 thank you\nm M speaker I yield The Well the lady\nhas yielded the well the chair\nrecognizes representative Adin to speak\nto the\nBill thank you madam speaker\npter members I rise in opposition to\nthis bill I always ask why is the author\nwriting the\nBill what is the purpose of the bill who\ndoes the bill\nserve while the stated goal of s sp212\nis to protect student and voter privacy\nthe Bill's Broad restrictions and vague\nlanguage may have unintended\nconsequences that limit Civic engagement\nconfuse implementation and chill\nlegitimate nonpartisan activity in\nschools overreach that could limit\nnonpartisan Civic education the bill\ncould have chilling effect on legitimate\nnonpartisan voter registration efforts\nin\nschools while School staff are Exempted\noutside Civic groups like The League of\nWomen Voters or student L democracy\nclubs May avoid engagement for fear of\nviolating ambiguous\nProvisions written attestations for\nsimply helping students register to vote\ncould discourage volunteers for\nparticipating Al\ntogether vague and Broad definitions\nrisk\nmisinterpretation the terms political\norganization acting on behalf of and\nfraudulently organized are not clearly\ndefined and could be subject to\npolitical misuse or over\nenforcement unclear language may lead to\nunequal application dependent on\npolitical views or affiliations of those\ninvolved suppresses are youth political\nengagement this will prohibit minors\nfrom organizing campaign related events\neven voluntary even voluntarily May\nsuppress Civic interests and political\nlearning at a formative\nage students often engage in political\nactivity as part of classes of or clubs\nthis law could penalize or silence their\ninactive the\ninitiative potentially undermines Trust\nin schools by placing criminal penalties\nand burdensome rules around activities\nlike voter registration the bill may\nlead schools to overcorrect and restrict\nall political activity even when\nallowed how many of you have been asked\nby one of your local high schools\npolitical clubs to attend one of their\nmeetings parents and students may lose\ntrust in the school environment that are\nperceived as as politically silenced\nover uh silenced or overly\npoliced\nfurer already gives families the right\nto opt out of directory information\ndisclosures this bill May duplicate or\nconflict with federal law creating\nadministrative confusion for\nschools weaponizing election law\nenforcement by adding harsh penalties\nfor new subjective offenses like\nfraudulent School\nevents organizations the bill opens the\ndoor to politically motivated\nprosecutions especially targeting youth\nactivists or marginalized\ncommunities so why to be\nfrank this piece of legislation was born\nfrom a desire for\nRetribution\nwhat what does this bill do it does\ncause confusion it's still very vague\nand and we still have to work on the\nlanguage and who does it not serve it\ndoes not serve our students it does not\nserve our parents and it does not serve\nour\nconstituents and for that I ask you and\nI urge you to vote no on this bill\nMadame speaker Pro term I yield the well\nthank you the gentleman has yielded the\nwell the chair recognizes representative\nSanchez to speak to the\nBill thank you madam chair\nI Rise here to oppose s sp12 not because\nI don't believe we must protect students\ndata I firmly believe we have to protect\nstudents data and I think there are some\ngreat Parts in this bill that do that\nthe main issue is of course in section\nthree lines 92 through 100 where a\ncampaign pack organization can't\norganize an event with a student under\nthe 18\nfraudulently what does that mean exactly\nit's not defined in this\nbill what I'm worried about is that\nfraudulent term being used to chill and\nsilence the First Amendment rights of\nour\nstudents at a time where students in\nthis country are being disappeared for\nexercising those First Amendment rights\nas\nwell we talk about how it's great when\nstudents get civically engaged that we\nneed more young people getting involved\nwhy aren't the youth getting involved we\nkeep talking on both sides of the aisle\nhow to get young voters engaged in\npublic service in politics and how to\nget them to vote and then gen Z becomes\nthe most politically active youth\ngeneration since the baby boomer\ngeneration and now suddenly the majority\nof parties like hey whoo there not like\nthat is it because the youth are\ndemanding gun control Swift action\nagainst climate change affordable\nhousing free public\neducation a living\nwage is it because of that that y'all\ndon't like those\nthings again I want to reiterate if\nsection three was removed from this bill\nI would support this measure but that is\nas it stands we cannot chill and silence\nthe voices of anyone in this state\nincluding our\nstudents our children will be attacked\nby this bill with their first amendment\nrights being attacked when I represent\nmy constituents I don't only represent\njust those who can vote Yes I have over\n30,000 registered voters in my district\nbut I have nearly 6,000 constituents\nmany of them students and children under\n18\ntheir thoughts their opinions and their\ncivic engagement matters just as much as\ntheir parents and there are many\nstudents in your District as well who\ndeserve representation and deserve a\nhave a voice just like anyone\nelse we have pages and high school\nstudents come to these Halls we applaud\nthem for their civic engagement but now\nwe want to limit that engagement their\nfirst amendment\nrights we want to punish them if they\nengage in a way we don't like\nwhat kind of democracy are we creating\nwith the passage of sb212 as it is\ncurrently so I urge my colleagues to\nvote no on S sp212 because we cannot\nsilence voices just because you disagree\nwith them let's continue to be a\ndemocracy thank you Madame chair I yield\nthe\nwell gentleman has yielded the well the\nchair recognizes representative Howard\nto speak to the bill\nhe\nwaves is there any objection to the\nprevious question being ordered the\nchair he's none the previous question is\nordered there is a Minority Report the\nchair recognizes representative\nWilkinson speak to The Minority Report\nthank you madam speaker uh today I Rise\nto oppose uh Senate Bill 212 and I think\nwe can all agree that we want to protect\nour children's\ninformation my\nissue um comes on lines\n42 so in committee we talked about the\ncrazy idea of a legislator being a\nparent of a public school\nstudent a legislator being a parent of a\npublic school student which I was under\nthis bill you can't separate David\nWilkerson parent David Wilkerson PTA\nparent from David Wilkerson\nlegislator those are all connected David\nWilkerson campaign is not David\nWilkerson pwder Springs resident they're\nnot different people so under this bill\nif I come in for a career day which is\nnot open to the public just so you know\nin public schools career days are not\nopen to the public it is a meeting in\nthe classroom and if I say by the way\nmake sure you register to vote and make\nsure you register for Selective Service\nI have to sign a form as a parent\nlegislator under this bill and that's\nwhat this says so the reality is that\nthe people that are doing the right\nthing or continue to do the right thing\nand you will have some people some\nKnuckleheads that will go out there and\ntry to get information they shouldn't be\ngetting but this bill is going to cause\na lot of issues I just hope and I have\none request to the majority party one\nrequest when we pass the divisive\nConcepts Bill a few years ago it only\napplied when it IT attacked Republicans\nI sent many emails about divisive\nConcepts attacking this last election a\nDemocratic candidate and it went on\nunheard ears both within the hallway and\nwithin this body so please make sure\nthat if we pass a bill make sure we\napply to everybody fairly and in this\ncase that means as a legislator if you\never Venture inside of a school and you\never tell anybody to register or you'll\nbe at an event where they can come and\nparticipate and get involved in their\ncivic duties that you make sure you sign\nin a test that you are not well that you\nsignning a test that you're doing that\nand I would like to see that if we're\ngoing to do that put it on the ethics\nwebsite so anytime anybody does it we\npublicly disclose that we're doing it\nbecause right now this bill is going to\npenalize those of us that have chosen to\nbe in public schools because it doesn't\nimpact private schools my understanding\nthose that have chosen to be in public\nschools is going to impact us and I just\nask that we treat everybody the same way\nand we want our students to be engaged\nbut if we could take a look at those\nlines fix it I would appreciate it\notherwise for now I would say please\nvote no on this bill and with that Mr\nSpeaker I yeld the\nwell chair recognizes representative\nEvans to speak to the\nBill thank you Madame speaker good\nafternoon colleagues I'm going to add my\nvoice to the chorus here against cabill\n212 not because I want our students\ninformation to be out there willy-nilly\nthat I think we should all be able to\nget it and and talk to them like it\nseems like some people think no that's\nnot what I think I don't think that's\nwhat anybody in here thinks and I also\ndon't think that's able to happen now I\nthink there's federal law that protects\nour students information and um\nreference was made to the ghost\nsituation during the last campaign and I\nthink that's exactly what it is um I\ndon't think anybody's information got\nout there or at least no one's shown me\nthat but if you want to protect student\ninformation that's fine you want to have\na an extra law that does exactly what\nfederal law already does I guess that's\nfine F my concern comes in section\nthree which starts on technically on\nline 87 my concern comes in on line 92\nand this is where we have this language\nthat says no candidate Campaign\nCommittee or political action committee\nand on and on shall solicit any\nindividual under 18 years old to\nfraudulently organize an event on the\nproperty of any local school system and\non and on and on you can skip down to\nthe last section on lines 99 to\n100 let's just let's just go together\nhere as if we were reading in church to\nmake sure we're\nclear section three line\n92 no candidate Campaign Committee or\npolitical action committee shall solicit\nany individual under 18 years to\nfraudulently organize an event on the\nproperty of a local school system skip\ndown to line 99 when such event is\notherwise prohibited by law or policy of\nthe local school system or an individual\nSchool thereof so what this means is you\ncan't fraudulently induce a student to\nparticipate in an event that they are\nalready prohibited from\nholding let me say that one more time\nthis law says a candidate cannot solicit\na student to engage in an event at a\nschool that the student already cannot\nparticipate in not just that the\ncandidate can't participate in but that\nthe school can't participate in\nso why are we doing\nthis it also only\nprohibits soliciting someone under 18 to\nparticipate in these events that they're\nnot that they're already not allowed to\nparticipate in so I guess you could\nsolicit a teacher in the public school\nall day every day to participate in an\nevent that the teacher is not allowed to\nparticipate in on school grounds\nwhy why is that\nokay why are we doing this maybe\nsomebody has an agenda here maybe they\nwant to use this for something\nelse okay let's pretend like this even\nis a problem for a second that we can't\nfraudulently induce someone to\nparticipate in an event that they\nalready can't do which means that would\nnever be held at the school unless we\njust assume that every teacher every\nprincipal every school board everybody\nis asleep and is letting this student\nparticipate in an event that they are\nalready not allowed to do and someone\nsolicited them to do it we've made this\nunlawful let's just pretend like all\nthat happens then\nwhat what are we going to\ndo what are we going to do to this\nperson who's fraudulently induced\nsomeone to do something that they were\nnever allowed to to do and never would\ndo it's never happened it really is a\nghost\nevent since there's no real effect if\nsomebody does this thing that is never\ngoing to\nhappen federal law already protects the\ndata the only thing my and and I you\nknow I'm trying to just apply Common\nSense logic to this spill the only thing\nI can think of is that we're trying to\nchill the young\npeople we're either doing that or we're\ngiving somebody campaign fodder for an\nanticipated opponent it's one of those\nthings and I would submit ladies and\ngentlemen that we have much better\nthings to do down here it's very\nexciting to get a bill that says um\nrelating to educational programs under\nthe quality basic education acts you\nthink oh wait maybe we're going to\nactually address the quality basic ation\nfunding formula that hasn't been\nRewritten since Joe Frank Harris was\ngovernor in the\n1980s when I was about\ntwo no what we're doing here is we are\neither giving campaign fod to someone\nand or we're chilling young people and\nyou know I have two thoughts about this\nI think it's already hard enough to get\nstudents to engage in politics because\nlet's be honest y'all we are not the\ncool kids in here we're just not it's\nnot the coolest thing to do in high\nschool to be involved in politics so\nit's already hard enough for that reason\num but even with all that being said we\nprobably have young people participating\nin politics as high at high at as high a\nrate as I've seen why do we want to pour\ncold water on that and I think that goes\non both sides I mean I think I think all\nof us in here have probably had to\nanswer questions that we'd rather not\nanswer because young people are paying\nattention so is this to protect us from\nhaving to answer out to the questions\nthat come out of the mouth of\nbabes\nmaybe and why do we want to discourage\nthis will also chill Us in this room\nfrom going out and talking to students\nand engaging with them for fear that\nwe're going to be questioned about\nwhether we are trying to fraudulently\ninduce them into an event that they're\nnot allowed to\nhold and then when a student is holding\nan event that they are allowed to hold\nMaybe somebody thinks an it's an event\nthat they're not allowed to hold and\nthen they're going to get questioned who\nput you up to this\nMissy or little mister I don't want I\ndon't want people coming to me because\nI'm talking to students and trying to\nengage them in the process and I don't\nwant people scaring our children and\nit's you know I I appreciate that um\nrepresentative Wilkerson and I were able\nto come up here and um speak with with\nsome of our younger members that were\nthat were lined up here here it makes me\nfeel youthful but this is how I got my\nstart was with young Democrats and I\nknow some of yall on here got your start\nwith young\nRepublicans I never I it never even\ncrossed my mind that somebody would\nthink somebody was putting me up to it\nand I would like to think that it never\ncrossed the minds of those candidates\nthat I got to engage in that somebody\nwas coming over to them and thinking\nthinking that they were trying to get me\ninvolved in something that I wasn't\nsupposed to be involved in that just\ninvites a whole layer of inquiry and\ninterrogation in in in a process that we\nshould be encouraging so it's very\ndisappointing that we've take had to\ntake up so much time to talk about a\nbill that really does Nothing Stops\nnothing and even if we pretend like it\nstops something we don't do anything\nabout it in this bill what so what if if\na person violates what we've put out in\nline 92 nothing is going to happen so in\nsummary this bill does nothing if it\ndoes anything it chills participation in\npolitical process which is something\nthat I would hope this deliberative body\nwould not want to be for and so I hope\nyou will join me in denying campaign\nfodder denying the chilling of political\nparticipation by our young people and\nvote no on this Bill thank you I yield\nthe\nwell chair recognizes uh repres uh\nchairman Irwin for the Chairman's time\nthank you madam speaker and uh\ncolleagues let me let me Begin by saying\nthat there's been an attack on student\ndata going on for quite a while and it\nit is imperative that we protect that\ndata for our students there's also\ncolleagues a tack on their time within\nthe classroom for Learning and we must\ntake action to defend ours our students\ntime to be engaged in the learning and\nwhat we're requiring to them and it just\nseems like we keep loading that plate up\nwith more and more distractions but\nrequiring more and more of their time so\ncolleagues the passage of Senate Bill\n212 is not just about attending\nstatues or excuse me amending statutes\nis about affirming our dedication to the\nwell-being and privacy of Georgia\nstudents let's come together to support\nthis essential measure reinforce the\nwalls that protect our educational\nspaces and unwarranted political\nintrusion\nso Madam speaker what I'd like to do to\nsomebody who's been much more engaged in\nthis process and understanding what this\nbill really does I would like to turn\nover the remaining of the time uh\nChairman's time to Chairman Jones\ngentleman has yielded the will and the\nchair recognizes chairman Jones to speak\nto the\nBill thank you madam speaker uh we have\ndebated this for some time but I thought\nit was important to come back in and\njust clear up a couple of things I think\nfirst and foremost there's been a lot\ntalked about assembly speech engagement\nand I can't tell you how much I agree\nwith all three of those things when it\ncomes to younger voters when it comes to\nyounger individuals who will become\nvoters we want to get them engaged in to\nthe process this bill does nothing to\ntheir First Amendment right around\nspeech around assembly matter of fact\nthere's a lot of things that we go to\nwhere we're not collecting data as a\nmatter of fact I would argue 90 95% of\nthe political activities we go to have\nnothing to do with collecting data all\nthis is saying is is if you collect the\ndata if you do it under the opes of for\ninstance voter registration then use it\nfor voter\nregistration what happens if that 1 and\na half year older thinks that he or she\nhas already registered because they\nregistered at the school and instead of\ndoing the right thing in registering\nthat person that fraudulent entity\nliterally just took the data and moved\nit over to a campaign to a candidate or\nto a pack second there has been a\nquestion inside of the well around why\nis this\nneeded around why is this needed we can\nprovide data to provide you information\nand backup that this occurred in\nGwinette fton and fory the first the\nfourth and the fifth largest school\ndistricts in our\nstate let's have that conversation third\nthere was a there was a comment made\nfrom the well regarding if fraudulent\nwas\ndefined I can assure you fraud is\ndefined in the\nocga 23-25\n[Music]\n1 take a look at that definition and\nthen apply it to lines 92 through 100\nand hopefully that will help you turn\nfrom a no to a yes and then finally a\ncomment was made in the well regarding\nfurpa the federal law around student\ndata and student data privacy I was\nactually shocked that furpa does not\ncover this exact situation when someone\nfraudulently goes into a k through2\nentity and tries to LIT Min minor in\nterms of their\nData before I close up I want to again\nreiterate number one under no way shape\nor form is this a First Amendment\ndiscussion in my mind that M the waters\nhave been muddied when we talk about the\nidea that this is in fact\ndiscouraging these young individuals\nfrom doing what is their constitutional\nright as a matter of fact I'll be the\nfirst one with a bullhorn telling them\nget together have that\nconversation be passionate about the\nthings that you believe in\ncampaign persuade do the things that we\ndo in here but with your colleagues just\ndon't do it when you're taking their\ndata and giving it to someone they\nshouldn't be giving it to because you\nknow why it can be used for the wrong\nreason thank you very much Madam speaker\nI yield the\nwell the gentleman has yielded the well\nfor what purpose does representative\nCanon\nrise well I had a question I mean we're\nin limbo right now may I still ask the\nquestion parliamentary inquiry a\nparliamentary inquiry please certainly\nis it not true that there has been no\nlawsuit spoken to in the well

adopting\nthe committee substitute chair hears\nnone the committee substitute is adopted\nis there any objection to agreeing to\nthe report of the committee which was\nfavorable to the passage of the

and\njust go over the changes that were made\nthe Senate substitute incorporates s sp7\nknown as Ricky and Alyssa's law in its\nentirety that will require all public\nschools to implement a mobile Panic\nalert system much like the one used at\nappalachi that we know saved countless\nlives and prevented as much a much\nlarger tragedy this will also require\neach School to procure digital mapping\ndata to be shared with the state and\nlocal agencies that respond to\nemergencies at school\nsystems the amended 268 also requires\ngima and Homeland Security to establish\na Statewide alert system to report and\nmonitor incidents of safety threats made\nagainst\nschools it will also require schools to\nadopt threat assessment plans providing\na structured multi-disciplinary process\nto identify assess and mitigate\npotential threats to schools while\nsupporting the safety and wellbeing of\nstudents and school\nPersonnel Bill also creates a qualified\nstudent advocacy specialist\nposition who's who's required to\ncoordinate Mental Health Services for\nstudents in crisis and it also creates\nthe grants to fund those\npositions colleagues after what we\nwitnessed at appalache this house\ncommitted to championing legislation to\nbolster bolster school security mandate\nstronger Communications between our\nschools and provide critical Mental\nHealth Resources to our students that's\nexactly what house bill 268 will\naccomplish and I ask for your favorable\nconsideration of this bill gentleman has\na couple of questions yes sir feel yield\nyes sir uh representative Roberts to\nyour left has recognized for a question\nthank you Mr Speaker does the gentleman\nyield I do um I'm all for all of these\nsecurity measures um I just am curious\non the uh was it Alyssa's law the\nmapping that is required to be\nimplemented by I think it was July of\n2026 um is there funding in the budget\nfor that or those school systems I have\nno idea what they cost um I just wonder\nif we're imposing an unfunded mandate on\nthe schools with quick turnaround time I\nthink most of the mapping is already\nrequired in the school safety plans we\ndid I believe in 23 okay so it's just an\naddition to okay thank\nyou gentleman you for another question I\ndo representative\nBennett to your left is recognized for a\nquestion thank you with the gentleman y\ni do you mentioned a mental health um\nPersonnel is that per each school or for\nthe school district I wasn't I couldn't\nfind it in the bill so it was originally\nour bill is a um Behavioral Health\ncoordinator and that's going to\nbe allocated based on population I\nbelieve it's 18,000 up to 18,000 get um\none that we would fund through grants\num of 18,000 to 36,000 would have two\nand over 36,000 students would get up to\nthree that would be funded by the grants\nthat we put in the budget if they want\nto have more they could have more they\njust set to fund in themselves per\nDistrict correct thank\nyou gentleman you for another question\nyes Mr Speaker representative Barnes to\nyour left is recognized for a question\nthank you Mr Speaker did a gentleman yel\nI will as far as the school safety\ndevices are they to be placed per\nclassroom like the alert system that is\nthe alert system that we use here at the\ncapital same thing as the alert b so are\nwe trying to place those in each\nclassroom is what I'm\nasking wait which alerts areum you speak\nyou talking about alysa's law or the one\nthat GMA is responsible for um I guess\nthe gma's law that we're going to\nimplement and put in each classroom are\nwe putting these alert systems in each\nclassroom or just in the school no that\nthat's information sharing to make sure\nthat if there is a credible threat to a\nschool system that all agencies are\ninvolved in that communication that was\npart of the lacking at appalache so the\nother system that you were explaining is\nthe actual device GRE the device in\nAlyssa's law is the Panic alert alert\nbadges like we have here okay and they\nwill go to each teacher or something\nlike that or student correct most\nsystems are using that I think if I'm\nnot mistaken we have about 80% maybe a\nlittle less than that compliance all\nright thank you\nyep gentleman yield for another question\none more uh representative Butner to\nyour left has recognized for a question\ndoes a gentleman yield I will um there\nwas a great deal of conversation after\nwhat happened in um wer and appalache\nschool and um one of the things that um\nthey were talking about is that the\nstudent had only been there very brief\nly and that the records from the\nprevious school that may have given an\nindication of a potential problem had\nnot arrived so when it talks about\nprocedures to meet the requirements and\nstudents education records in a timely\nmanner is timely mannered identified or\nwithin five days okay thank you very\nmuch gentleman yield or one more\nquestion is he one more uh represent\nSanchez is recognized for a\nquestion thank you Mr Speaker this J and\nyield I will so the G3 database was\nremoved from this bill that we passed\nfrom the house or the S3 database is\nremoved correct okay feel further yield\nyes but the bill still includes um\ndisciplinary records following students\nif they have a disciplinary record to\nfrom

Affairs that committee\nrecommends this bill do\npass representative representative Chaz\nCanon is recognized to present the bill\nrepresentative Canon thank you Mr\nSpeaker members of the house I have for\nyou Senate Bill 199 which provides some\nmuch needed uniformity and in terms of\nour campaign Finance disclosures it also\nstreamlines and simplifies some of our\nreporting requirements I want to thank\nMr David amatti he was in the gallery\nwith us right now our state ethics\ncommissioner uh Commission Executive\nDirector for his input on this\nlegislation this is a clean bill no\namendments it pass the Senate without a\nsingle no vote I think you'll like it as\nwell uh let me tell you about some of\nthe key Provisions local filings now\ndone with City and County uh election\nclerks will now be reverted back to the\nstate start January 1st\n2027 uh it makes the deadline 60 days\nprior to an election to submit\ncomplaints against the candidate for\nelection currently at 30 uh changes\ncampaign disclosure reports to quarterly\nevery year and provides uniformity in\nboth election years and non-election\nyears and those days will be standard\nacross the board January 31st April 30th\nJuly 31st and October 20th it also\nchanges reporting for packs political\naction committees to those dates as well\nso uniformity across reporting dates it\nalso requires packs to have separate\nbank accounts much like campaigns it\nmoves Financial de closure reports to be\ndue on April 1st every year instead of\ndifferent days in a non election year\nagain making it clarifying the situation\nmaking more simple uh it also requires\nour F friends outside on the ropes to\nmake their reports once a month no later\nthan the fifth day of the month and Al\nalso simplif I lobbyist\nregistrations um one of the last things\nI'll kind of talk about is also\nrestricts elected officials and\ncandidates for office home address from\npublic view uh so it does a good bit of\nthings makes things more uniform\nstandard across the board Mr Speaker\nI'll stand for any questions you have a\ncouple of questions uh representative\nStacy Evans to your left has recognized\nfor a question thank you Mr Speaker does\nthe gentleman yield I yield um I think\nthere's definitely more good in this\nbuild and bad but I did have a question\nI wanted to ask you about on lines\n572 I guess really starting on 571 where\nwe are talking about financial\nstatements say Amen when you have\nit nobody got my joke\nwhat yeah no I just want I was are you\nthere I didn't want to start yeah yes\nokay greater than the Thousand but not\nmore than\n2500 well starting it's that whole\nsection starting on line 571 through 581\nwhere we are we're having um this part\nof the bill appears to me sets out the\nrequirements for and it may just be the\nStatewide candidates for their financial\nstatements my question is we've got a\nlot of compression at the beginning when\nyou're setting out um when candidates\nare setting out their their income or\ntheir what they might hold in something\nyou know not more than a th000 then\nwe've got between 1,00 and 2500 2500 and\n5,000 5,000 and 15,000 really tiny um\nrelatively tiny ranges but then we are\nlike like 500,000 to a million a million\nto 5 million then greater than 5 million\nso I'm having a hard time understanding\nwhy there's more interest in knowing\nwhether a candidate\nowns you know between a th000 and 15,000\nbut not knowing whether it was 5 million\n10 million 100 million 200 million 500\nmillion we're just letting that\ngo as high as the sky can go and I was\nwondering if that was discussed and what\nperhaps was the logic there uh I can't\nto speak to that exactly I just know\nthat it was creating ranges for personal\nfinancial disclosure statements on a\nsource of income ex instead of Zack\namounts uh that's second I all I can\ngive you in terms of the reasoning\nbehind that perhaps that's something\nthat could be looked at because I I I\nthink from a transparency standpoint\nthere's not a lot to be gained between\nthe range of to me a th000 to 15,000\nmaybe even 50 um but there's a lot to\nknow between 5 million and 500 million\nand we're we're leaving that to chance\nwould would you yield for one more I\nwill um I understand the logic of not\nhaving the ethics\nCommission accept or decline a a\ncomplaint during the 60 days before an\nelection I actually thought that was the\nlaw already but what happens to those\nbecause there there very well may be\nsome wrongdoing that needs to be brought\nto someone's attention and will those\njust sit or do they have to be filed\nagain after the election's over I will\nfind out but the intent with that is not\nto have a\nyou know somebody logic complaint\nagainst you that close to an election\ntimeline I think it backs that timeline\nup so we can have more time between\nthose dates in the election uh but I\nwill find out get back to you C could\nyou tell me though well not the logic in\nthat I'm wondering what happens to the\ncomplaints the the commission's not\ngoing to accept them or reject them I\nsee the motion from the executive\ndirector saying it's going to go back to\nafter the election so you would have to\nrefile it after the election that's\ncorrect no you don't you they you don't\nhave to refile have to file it but you\ncould they roll\nover so they're still heard but after\nthe election understood and I guess if\nif you would yield a little bit further\nhave a little discussion here if one\nmore question thank you Mr Speaker um I\nI I understand in it's great logic not\nto give a campaign fodder to say a\ncomplaint's been filed or the ethics\ncommission is considering this complaint\nand that goes on a mailer within 60 days\nof the campaign but are we actually\ntaking that away because if they file it\nand it's not accepted or rejected it\nseems like it would still be accurate\nfor the complaining candidate within\nthose 60 days to say ethics complaint\nhas been filed against XYZ is that would\nthat be accurate if the candidate said\nthat um not sure I can speak to that uh\njust I think we're just trying to\nbasically make some uniformity and some\nSimplicity to the timeline um thank you\nthank you\nmay not comply with state law but I bet\nyou it'll be said by\nsomebody uh representive bur chett whip\nB is recognized for a question thank you\nMr Speaker does the gentleman yield I\nyield to the whip did I understand you\nto say that um this is going to simplify\nour filing so that even in election\nyears and non-election years we're\nfiling quarterly is that correct that's\ncorrect so we don't have this three days\nprovision uh like we've got right now\nalternates 7 7 between 7 and 15 15 days\non non-election years it makes it\nstandard April 1st I believe thank\nyou you you want another question Mr\nSpeaker and in the voice of uh Deputy\nWhip Mr Speaker I will yield the\nwell gentleman yielded the\nwell is there any objection to the\nprevious question being ordered hearing\nnone the previous question is ordered is\nthere

deceptive practices in\nconsumer transactions unlawful examples\nthis bill have referred to the committee\non agriculture and consumer affairs that\ncommittee recommends that this bill do\npass by committee\nsubstitute the lady from Lions\nrepresentative Hagen is recognized to\npresent the\nBill thank you Mr Speaker um friends\ntypically after a natural disaster F we\ntend to see the best in people but sadly\non some occasions we do see the worst in\npeople most recently after Hurricane\nHelen we saw scammers in the form of\nstorm chasing repair contractors who\nsuddenly appear to make home repairs\nthese um and I'm sure you've seen them\nin other instances of natural disasters\naround the state they show up and ready\nclaim to be ready to make repairs\nhowever they often uh are praying on our\nsenior citizens and potentially others\nof us who are not particularly well\nversed in contractual language so uh\nmany people who are in a time of intense\nstress because of the natural disaster\nsign contracts for home repairs more\nquickly than they would have otherwise\nwithout fully understanding what they're\nsigning so this bill would do two things\nto address this first it amends the\nGeorgia fair business Practices Act to\nprovide greater protection for\nhomeowners in the 12 months following a\nnatural disaster to make sure that\ncontracted work is performed in a timely\nand professional manner and the second\nthing that this bill does is prohibit\nthe assignment of insurance proceeds to\ncontractors for a period of one year\nfollowing the natural disaster so it\nwhat it does is it gives homeowners who\nare in a time of intense stress addess\nthe ability to cancel their contract if\nthe contractor does not perform as they\nshould it only applies within the 12\nmonths after a natural disaster in a\ncounty that was included in a state of\nemergency Proclamation by the governor\nand right now this includes every county\nin the state because we have had these\num natural disaster state of emergency\nproclamations um Statewide for winter\nstorms hurricanes um within the past 12\nmonths so um although it was a concern\nimmediately following the hurricane and\nit and this bill did come out of those\nconcerns it is written in such a way\nthat it would apply to any County who\nhas uh within the last 12 months been\ndeclared a natural a a State of\nEmergency due to a natural\ndisaster Mr Speaker that is the the bill\nand I'd be happy to take some questions\nif there are any lady has no questions\nthank you I ask for your

Committee\non Public Safety worked on this uh this\nyear twice once with the house bill when\nthe Senate bill passed 49 to1 I talked\nto the Senate sponsor and he agreed to\nwork on our house version that the\nGeorgia Sheriff's Association and the\nhouse Public Safety Committee had made\nsome revisions to so we had a second\nhearing and the committee passed it out\non a bipartisan basis Georgia is one of\ntwo states Nebraska being the other one\nthat lacks a uh jurisdictional basis for\nuh the federal authorities to work with\nour state authorities in cases of\ndisaster or upon uh State request with a\nJoint Task Force that was an inadvertent\nrepeal 5 years ago this bill would fix\nit and I really appreciate uh the house\nmembers in public safety working so hard\non this on a bipartisan

bill\nour house bill absolutely I appreciate\nyour work on it Public Safety and for\nspeaking to Federal Federal authorities\nto get in better shape absolutely thank\nyou thank you representative\nLim is recognized for a question to your\nright thank you Mr Speaker does the\ngentleman yield I do I had a question do\nfederal law enforcement acting under the\nrequest of state or local law\nenforcement have the same immunities as\nthe state law enforcement the reason I\nask is I'm concerned as as I'm sure you\nknow Federal feral law enforcement are\nsubject to viven which are far narrower\nthan section 1983 and so if there's a\ndifferential in immunities it's possible\nthat federal law enforcement would act\nin a far less constrained manner than\nstate or law enforce state law\nenforcement would in the exact same\nscenario and I'm concerned that in that\ncases either one would point to the\nother and either would avoid\naccountability or perhaps even worse the\nstate would hide under the guise of the\nfederal law enforcement that that is a\ngood question representative Limb and uh\nwe got some questions answered in\ncommittee number one federal law\nenforcement uh they are prohibited\nnationally from Moonlighting and doing\nanything in the private sector uh like\nsometimes people do in Georgia so when\nthey come to work with the state law\nenforcement they are doing it under a\nspecific request think New Orleans on\nJanuary the 1st when that terrible\ntragedy happened U that kind of thing if\nit happened here we'd want everybody uh\nhands on deck in law enforcement whether\nit's a state or federal issue going on\nand so the issue of IM if they're doing\ntheir federal work on federal matters\nthe federal law would apply and the\nstate work if they're doing it upon\nState request that would be governed by\nanalysis that we have here in Georgia I\nbelieve Mr Speaker if there are no\nfurther questions I yield the well you\nhave questions but it's your choice I\nyield\nwell you you were\npersuaded gentleman yielded the well is\nthere any objection to the previous\nquestion being ordered hearing none the\nprevious question is ordered is

is uh sort of a house\nbill language coming back to us in the\nSenate bill Senate Bill 298 at least the\nhouse uh or the rules committee\nsubstitute that I believe you have in\nfront of you was House Bill 531 in\nessence it provides that a um a local\ngovernment or any any type of\ngovernmental entity that it's sued if\nthey receive an adverse ruling regarding\nuh sovereign immunity they have a right\nof direct appeal to that ruling but\nthey've got to exercise the appeal only\none time and within 30 days during\ncommit legislative immunity and then\nlegislative privilege um has been added\nto that and it's also there's also a\nroute for direct Appeal on a ruling\nrelating to that whether it's a criminal\nor civil case and there is no limitation\nbecause of course that can come up\nmultiple times within uh litigation\nduring the course of Discovery so that\nis basically the bill Mr Speaker if\nthere are any questions I'll be glad to\ntry to answer\nthem gentleman has a question\nrepresenting Miller to your left\nSenator thank you Mr Speaker just a\ngentleman you yes ma'am was there any\nconsideration uh to giving citizens the\nright to appeal in adverse ruling direct\nappeal in other words if the trial court\nfound that the municipality had some\nkind of immunity that the citizen could\ndirect appeal it my understanding is\nthey afforded a right of direct appeal\nalready because that'd be a final order\nin the case thank you so there and and\nthis is the um\num in the statute on on Direct appeals\nthat are other than final orders so if\nso if so if it disposed of just riddle\nme a second if it disposed of one party\nto the sue the municipality but there\nwere other parties who did not have the\nimmunity um would the citizen be able to\nappeal even though the case was still\ngoing on and that I that I cannot answer\nto if there's multiple parties I'm not\nsure they probably would have to get get\na certificate to appeal in that case\nthank

question is\nreally to help colleagues in the room\nthat really don't quite understand our\nvery important industry um that really\nneeds to be highlighted more in the\nstate of Georgia is that not true that\nthe funeral industry does need to be\nhighlighted more in the state of Georgia\nit needs the funeral directing needs to\nbe a part of the list of hi career\ndemands is that not true as well\nabsolutely I agree with Lady and is it\nnot further true that we do need to\nseparate the license of funeral\ndirectors and Embers in the state of\nGeorgia is that not true as well I would\nnot if the ladies so States I agree with\nher but back to this bill Senate Bill\n241 is it not true that this bill is\nonly for is optional for families that\nare that want to have this type of um\nservice this cremation service and it\nput guard rails in place to protect the\nfamilies as well as well as the\nenvironment you're absolutely right for\nthose families that choose to use this\ntype of procedure you know I think that\nmaybe in another year we'll be bearing\nthem like the crows buried them out west\nwe'll be putting them on scaffolds and\nthings like this but it's just another\nway of disposing of the remains but is\nisn't it not further true that depending\non the funeral home that you use you can\nprobably get a really good deal by going\nthis route as well right is that not\ntrue well I'm not sure about that they\ntell me that this is a pretty expensive\nway but we know how environmentalists\nare they'll pay a little bit more to get\na little bit less but is it not further\ntrue that I have a deal for $3,900\nthat'll take care of everything is that\nnot for other truth so ma'am so thank\nyou thank thank you I will be supporting\nthis bill and I encourage my colleagues\nto do the same thank you Mr Speaker I\nwould certainly encourage members to\nvote for Senator Williamsville and uh\nlet's move on to some other subjects so\nwhy you're a wise man\nand

students\nadvertising that they'll have exams\ntaken for you this is in college our\ntechnical schools but primarily in where\nit's most damaging is in the professions\nwhere these companies advertise that\nsomebody will take your profession\nProfessional Licensing tests and what\nwe're seeking to do today is add that\npractice with a new code section and\nthen have that code section alluded to\nin the fair business practices act so\nthat the secret I'm sorry the Attorney\nGeneral would be the person that could\nprosecute that our idea here is that\nthese companies that are praying on\nstudents and our Professionals in the uh\nthe state of Georgia that then get a\nlicense because somebody else took the\ntest and are at risk of losing that\nlicense if they're found out so what our\nSenator uh Senator kpatrick has brought\nto us today and what I bring to you in\nSenate Bill 213 is very simple it holds\nthose companies\nresponsible for cheating basically to\nget a grade or a project done in school\nor a professional licenser test and\nprotect the the people the students the\nprofessional licensees and the public\nstate of Georgia and with that Mr\nSpeaker I'll answer any questions um
