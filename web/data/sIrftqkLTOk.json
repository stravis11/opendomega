It is my proud\nhonor to introduce our pastor of the\nday, Pastor Pete Peterson.\nPastor Peterson has attended Community\nBible Church in Stockbridge for more\nthan 16 years, where he currently serves\nas executive pastor of the church and as\npastor of schools for a community\nChristian school. Pastor Peterson is a\nretired US Army officer with a\ndistinguished career spanning more than\n23 years. He earned numerous military\nawards for outstanding achievement,\nincluding the Bronze Star, and several\nmeritorious service medals. His\ninternational military assignments\ninclude Germany, Korea, Kuwait, and\nIraq. Pastor Peterson holds a master's\ndegree in military arts and science from\nthe command and general staff college\nand a master's degree in education from\nCentral Michigan University. Most\nrecently, Pastor Peterson was selected\nby Governor Brian Kemp in 2022 to serve\non the Georgia Veteran Service Board. He\nmet his wife Anita while they were both\nserving as soldiers in Germany. They\nhave been married now for 39 years. They\nhave two adult children, both military\nveterans, and three grandchildren. And\ncolleagues, it is especially fitting\nthat Pastor Peterson is with us today\nbecause today marks the 85th birthday of\nthe United Service Organizations, the\nUSO, founded on February 4th, 1941\nduring World War II by President\nFranklin D. Roosevelt to provide morale,\nrecreation, and support services to our\nservice members and their families.\nPastor Peterson's life of service,\nleadership, and care for military\nfamilies reflects that same mission.\nSide note, I will be honoring the USO's\n85th birthday here in the chamber later\nthis month. And I also invite you to\njoin us this afternoon at 2:30 at the\nUSO at Hartzfield Jackson Atlanta\nInternational Airport, the busiest USO\nin the world, for a cake cutting\nceremony recognizing the men and women\nwho've served and defended our nation\nfor more than 250 years in so many\nroles. And now, please give a warm\nSenate welcome to Pastor Peterson. All\nright.\n>> Come on. We can do better than that,\nright? I hope. Can we just a little bit\nbetter? Thank you. Thank you for that\nunsolicited.\nFor God so loved the world that he gave\nhis only begotten son that whosoever\nbelieves in him should not perish but\nhave everlasting\nlife. Can y'all help me say that? For\nGod so loved the world that he gave his\nonly begotten son that whosoever\nbelieves in him should not perish but\nhave everlasting\nlife. And my question to you this\nmorning is when was the last time\nsomebody told you that they love you?\nJust look around. When's the last time\nsomebody actually told you that they\nloved you? And if you haven't heard it\nfor a while, I just want to say today\nthat I love you in Jesus name. Matter of\nfact, look at your neighbor. Say,\n\"Neighbor,\nI love you in Jesus name.\"\nAll right. Very good.\nSo, I want to thank Senator Halpern for\nthe invitation and that amazing\nintroduction. Uh, Mr. President, and to\nthe rest of this esteemed chamber. Thank\nyou for what you do here at the Capitol.\nWe pray that the Lord will bless you\nwith the wisdom, the compassion, uh, and\nthe love to help all Georgians to live a\nsecure, stable, and prosperous life. So\ntoday, I started out the session by\ndeclaring John 3:16. And and and why did\nI do that? Now, I know most of you've\nheard that John 3:16 at church. I know I\nheard it at Sunday school because my\ngrandmother Johnny Lee Levit down in\nDawson, Georgia, Terrell County, she\nwould religiously come and abduct my\nbrother and me from our home and take us\nto church against our will. It was a\nhostage situation. We did not want to\ngo, but she still took us to Bulerand\nBaptist Church. But I thank God now\nlooking back over all those years that\nmy grandmother wanted to make sure that\nher grandbs had a relationship with the\nLord Jesus Christ more than she wanted\nto be popular with us cuz I want to let\nyou know she was not popular with us.\nOkay? Just want to let you know that.\nBut I started out talking about John\n3:16 and it's to remind everyone that\nthis is one of the most lifechanging\nuh transformative scriptures in the\nBible. This scripture lets each one of\nus know that God loves us so much that\nhe sent his son Jesus Christ to pave the\nway to heaven. And this is not just a\ntouchyfey\nlove that fades when I blow it. It's the\ntype of love that we call agape love. It\nis unconditional.\nIt is longsuffering and it is enduring.\nNow, it's not enough just to know John\n3:16 and that God sent Jesus to rescue\nmankind. We have to personally accept\nhim. Somebody say personally. All right,\nsomebody say person. Awesome. Now, as a\n20-year-old soldier in Hano, West\nGermany, Third Armored Division, one\nFriday night, I was sitting in the back\nof the church and the pastor gave the\naltar call and I found out that my\ndestination was not heaven. So I was no\nlonger comfortable with that. So what I\ndid, I walked down to the altar and\nsaid, \"I want Jesus in my heart.\" And\nlet me tell you this, that significantly\nchanged the trajectory of my life. And I\nhave not been the same. Not just because\nI got an assurance of a heavenly home,\nbut more than that, it changed my heart\nto the point that the love of God\nstarted pouring out of me and it started\naffecting those around me. Now, I don't\nknow about you, but when I grew up in my\nhousehold, we never really hugged each\nother. We never said we love you. We\nnever kissed each other. We were not the\nBrady Bunch. We were not the Cosby Show.\nWe were the Petersons. Now, I know that\nmy mom and dad loved us because they fed\nus, they clothed us, and they nurtured\nus. But it just was not our tradition.\nAnd uh I want to let you know that as I\ndid grow up, I got a chance to leave and\nleave Dawson, Georgia, and get ready to\nfly out to Germany. And I remember that\nmy my mom, as our 19-year-old, she took\nme to the Albany bus station. I was\ngetting on that to go to Charleston,\nSouth Carolina to fly out to Germany. I\nwanted to tell my mom that I loved her,\nbut I didn't. I wanted to hug her, but I\ndidn't. She wanted to do the same thing,\nbut she didn't because that was not our\ntradition.\nAnd it was 28 months later that I saw my\nmom again. And by that time, the love of\nGod had been shared abroad in my heart.\nAnd when I got home, I sat in my mom's\nlap. I gave her the biggest kiss I\ncould. And I told her that I loved her.\nAnd we started a legacy of love. So that\nnow my kids, my grandkids, we all say\nthat we love you. We all hug each other\nand we all kiss each other. Okay, now\nPete, you're sitting here talking about\nlove in the Senate chamber. How's that\ngoing to help me? I am so glad that you\nasked that. I asked earlier, when was\nthe last time somebody told you that\nthey loved you? And I know that as\nelected officials and you're taking care\nof the business of the people, you need\nto know that somebody loves you.\nsomebody uh has your back and you have\nfamily members that you can also love.\nJust know that love reciprocates.\nIf you spread love when you need it,\nyou can get it back when you need it the\nmost. Okay.\nAgain, why do we need to know this? Has\nanybody ever had a difference of opinion\nwith anybody in the chamber here?\n>> No. There you go. That's what I thought.\nBut the thing is, showing love and\nletting love shed abroad in our heart,\nwe can still be civil to each other\nbecause we know that we have a God that\nreally, really, really loves us. So, I\nkeep talking about this legacy of love.\nAnd this is one of the things I want to\ntalk about that the Lord sent Jesus his\nvery best to redeem us. His love builds\nbridges and tears down walls if we let\nit.\nI did ask, when was the last time\nsomebody told you that they loved you?\nNow, when was the last time you told\nsomebody that you loved them? And if\nit's been a while, I want to make sure\nthat you go out and tell them. Please\nremember that your heavenly father loves\nyou so much that he cared to send his\nvery best to rescue you. Now, as we\nstand for our prayer, as we stand,\nI remember a hymn by Joseph Scriven, and\nit says, \"What a friend we have in\nJesus. All our sins and grief to bear.\nWhat a privilege it is to carry\neverything to God in prayer.\" Can y'all\njoin me in saying that? Look at your\nneighbor. Say, \"Neighbor,\n>> what a friend we have in Jesus.\n>> All our sins and griefs to bear.\n>> All our sins. What a privilege it is\nwhat a privilege it is\n>> to carry everything\n>> to God in prayer.\n>> God pray.\n>> Let us pray. Lord, you're good and your\nmercy endures forever. Thank you for\nbeing our God. Thank you for being our\nfriend. Today we ask that you would\nbless these senators to faithfully serve\nyou and the citizens of Jo Georgia. give\nthem the wisdom, courage, and compassion\nto be blessings to their constituents so\nthat we can live quiet and peaceable\nlives. It's in Jesus name we pray and we\nthank God. Amen. Amen. And amen. God\nbless you.\nJust remind everybody we have the state\nof judiciary today. So we'll be walking\nacross at about 10:40.\n10:40. So in about 9 minutes from now. I\nknow. Get excited. Senator, it's going\nto be fun.\nSenator from the 52nd.\nSenator from 52.\nYou got the doc of the day. Come on up\nhere, Doc.\nThank you, Mr. President. I actually\ndon't have the doctor today, but since\nthe center of the 42nd isn't in here,\nI'll introduce him. Um he uh\nJean McDas is an attending and assistant\nprofessor in the department of emergency\nmedicine at Emory University Hospital\nbackground in social biological sciences\nand he's been active in organized\nmedicine since 2010.\nHe and I both do watch the pit. So uh um\nit it can be realistic at times. And u\nwith that I'll let him say a few words\nto us. We appreciate his work in the ER\nand um working at Emery where as you\nknow I did my anesthesia at.\n>> All right.\n>> Thanks S. It's a true pleasure. So my\nname is again Shami Doss. I'm an ER doc\nat Emory over on main campus. So if you\never need anything, please don't ever\nhesitate to come and reach out and find\nus. Uh we are here to serve you. Uh the\ndoctor of the day program is a privilege\nfor us. So, it's an honor for me to be\nhere and I hope if you have any issues,\nI've already treated a couple of your\ncolleagues today. Uh please don't\nhesitate to stop by the medical aid\nstation. The one thing I do want to\nstate is that it's so important that the\nwork you do today uh and do here this\nsession because as you know, healthc\ncare is one of the major issues that our\npatients are facing on a day-to-day\nbasis and access to care is one of those\nbig challenges. So, anything you can do\nto improve healthcare access would be\ngreat for all Georgians in our uh\nprosperity. Thank you.\n>> Dr. I am here. This is this this is\nSenator your guest here.\nAre there any unanimous consents?\nDoes any senator wish to rise on a point\nof personal privilege?\n>> I know the senator from the first\nwas wanting to be first.\n>> All right, I recognize S from the 12th.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nColleagues,\nI rise to defend my professional\nand political integrity\nand that of my seat, Senate District 12.\nSenate Bill 171 was presented in the\neducation committee on yesterday.\nAnd let me make this perfectly clear.\nFor 22 years, I have strongly advocated\nfor quality\neducation\nin the state of Georgia,\nfor quality educators\nin the state of Georgia,\nand most certainly quality educational\nleaders\nin the state of Georgia.\nAnd for 22 years,\nwe have failed our children miserably\nwith peacemeal educational policies and\nbillions of dollars.\nDuring the discussion of SB 171,\nit was inferred\nfalsely\nof me speaking for minority students\nonly.\nI did not say that. I did not use the\nword minority student.\nWhen constituents in district 12 have\nissues,\nneed help or assistance,\nthey do not care\nabout party affiliations.\nThey don't care what color the senator\nis. They don't care how many degrees one\nmayo hold.\nThey only want to be served.\nSo as we legislate,\nplease remember as I was taught from a\nchild until now\nto respect all individuals. And when I\nmade the pledge\nto be a state senator, it was for\neverybody in my district, regardless to\nwho they are and where they live.\nAnd I respectfully request that we do\nnot infer\nor make inferences as to what\nand how we feel.\nEvery piece of legislation that I'm\nlooking at, that I'm signing on to is\nfor the good of District 12 and the\nstate of Georgia. every child, every\nadult citizen.\nSo I would would respectfully ask that\nwe not categorize individuals based on\nwhat we think and how we feel.\nIt's insensitive.\nIt's demeaning\nand it's not true. Thank you colleagues\nfor listening. Thank you, Mr. uh\nPresident. I yield the well.\n>> Thank you, Senator.\nOne of the finest senators in this room\nfrom Albany, Georgia. She's a good lady.\nOkay. Um\nwe're going to Majority Leader is\ngetting ready to make a motion. We're\ngoing to get ready to head over to the\nHouse for the state of judic judiciary.\nUh recognize the majority leader for a\nmotion.\n>> Mr. President, I move that the Senate\nstand in recess pursuant to SR 645 for\nthe purpose of convening a joint session\nto hear the address an address from the\nChief Justice of the Supreme Court and\nthat upon delusion disillusion\nof the joint session the Senate stand\nadjourned till 10:00 a.m. Thursday,\nFebruary 5th.\n>> All right, Secretary, read the caption.\nThe rules committee will meet upon\nadjourment in room 450 of the capital.\nThe public safety committee has been\ncancelled. The agricultural and consumer\naffairs committee will meet at 2 p.m. in\nroom 307 of clob. The finance committee\nwill meet at 3 p.m. in mezzanine 1. The\nhealth and human services committee will\nmeet at 4 p.m. in room 450 of the\ncapital. Mr. President, that completes\nthe order.\n>> All right. So, we'll uh\nafter this motion passes, we will line\nup back there and then we'll walk over\nfor the stages of the state of for the\njudiciary. So, uh the majority leader\nhas moved. All those in favor of the\nmotion signify by saying I.\n>> Oh, wow. Y'all are lively today. Wow.\nAll right. All those opposed, no.\n>> All right. We are journ. And let's head\nover to and see our friends across the\nhall.",
