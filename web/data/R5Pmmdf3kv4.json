I told somebody other day that my pastor was going to be here today and\nAnd they looked at me and said, well, you know, we didn't think you had a heart.\nBut now we know, you know, it's even worse now that we think you have a pastor.\nSo it's, uh, it's kind of, if you, I talked to the little lady yesterday,\nwho had, uh, came in with her father, a pastor, and I asked her, I said, you know,\nwhat my favorite word is? She said, no, I said, it's no.\nAnd her dad said, well, that's my favorite word too.\nAnd she said, yeah, that's right.\nYou know, I know everybody in here has heard the story of the turtle sitting on top of\na fence post and that they always had to have somebody help them get there.\nAnd I think everyone in this room can identify folks in their life who met that criteria\nof helping you get to where you are now.\nAnd I dare say that, of course, now I'm a little older than most of you, our Williams.\nBut I can list four or five people that were instrumental in my life to bring me here\nand to help me in a whole lot of other ways.\nbeen very fortunate and I want to tell you about two groups. One group is a group that\nhelps me professionally and the other group is the one that helps me with my faith and\nit's a unique opportunity when you have one person who fits in both categories and my\nPastor Jimmy Older is that individual? I'm on the sit-down for you know I\nhear to listen to me. Jimmy Older pastor first bad discharge in Columbus he\ntold me just just introduce me here's Jimmy so here's Jimmy.\nMr. Speaker, you're a friend to Muscogee County.\nThank you so much.\nChairman Smith, members of the House of Representatives,\nfriends, it is my distinct honor to be here.\nI mean that from the bottom of my heart.\nThis is a place of history, a place that has inspired\nmy life, all of my life.\nThose who sat at these desks are the ones that\nhave touched my life in a very special way.\nof my host, Richard Smith, I'd say he is my friend,\nhe is my parishioner, and he's a statesman\nthat I respect and deeply love.\nHe's made an indelible mark on our community,\nboth as citizen and representative.\nHe is largely responsible for the Chattahoochi Valley\nCommunity Foundation.\nHe also is largely responsible for the Mercer\nschool of medicine, location there, and you have been so generous to fund it, and we're\nso grateful for that. Thank you so much for that.\nRichard epitomizes servant leadership. And, you know, from my childhood, I've loved\ngovernment, I've loved the governance system, I've loved being involved in any way I possibly\ncould, wanted to be as close to it as I possibly could. To the point that as a little kid,\nI wanted to grow up in the governor of Georgia.\nI really did.\nAnd it was an aspiration, a desire of my heart\nthat's been there all of my life.\nI followed the work of government so closely\nthat I've been privileged to know or to meet\n10 of the 13 people who served as governor of this state\nin my lifetime.\nI mean, I work to do that.\nI've known representatives, I've known senators,\nI've known national people in Senate and House.\nI've known a couple of presidents.\nI've had an opportunity to do this,\nbut that's the passion of my life.\nI enjoy this.\nIt's been important to me.\nIt was not a matter of power as a kid.\nI looked at it as a way to really help people,\na place where you can go and serve\nand you can make a difference\nand you can change people's lives.\nIt's a wonderful kind of experience.\nOne day somebody who, recently, who knew of that,\ndesired my heart and had known me for many years,\ncame up and said, well, you know, you're getting older,\nsaid, when you retire, you're going to run for office\nsomewhere.\nAnd I heard myself say the unthinkable.\nI said, no, I said, the dream is gone.\nI said, my childhood dream, that which I had hoped for,\nis really gone now.\nAnd it caught me off guard to hear myself say that,\nBecause over the past years, it has been dreamed out of me\nin some way or another by so many things that have happened\nand so much of the pressure that's been out there\nand the literal and things that have been in place.\nI found myself saying I wanted to go from it\nrather than toward it, but the thing that disturbed me more\nthan anything else was the feeling that I had\nthat if it could do that to a dream I'd had all my life,\nwhat is it doing to other people?\nSo I went and I read from a favorite passage of scripture and it's way too long for me\nto share with you today the whole passage, but let me just capsule it for you.\nThe story is of Eli who is the judge in Chalo, the high priest at Chalo.\nHe also was the second to the last judge before Israel had kings.\nAs a judge, as the priest, he was kind of the seat of not only government, but also the\nseat of religious influence within that place.\nHe was the kind of man who had served with distinction and was a person that people honored,\nbut he had kids who were not committed and were not called to the task.\nThey began to take power and try to seize it and use it for themselves.\nThey began to cause conflict and problems.\nthis mix add that there was a couple who wanted to have a baby. They wanted to have a boy.\nAnd so Elkina and Hannah begged the Lord to please give them a son. And Hannah said,\nif you give me a son, I'll dedicate him to the Lord. I'll always dedicate him to the\nLord. And for the Lord's service. And Samuel was born. And when Samuel was born, she did\nexactly what she said, she took him to the high place, to Eli, to be a servant there,\nand to grow up under his tutelage, to grow up under his influence, and with idealism,\nand with call, and with purpose, Samuel went to that place, and really wanted to serve.\nIt wasn't power, it was service.\nsaddest part of the scripture though is it says that in those days the voice of\nthe Lord was silent and there were no visions. It wasn't because the Lord wasn't\nspeaking, it was because nobody was listening. It wasn't because God didn't want\nto give visions, it was because no one paid attention to them. And here was\nSamuel who was in the mix, he were Eli's sons who were causing all sorts of\nproblem and he was Eli caught right in the middle of it all. And so one night\nSamuel was asleep and the Lord called him Samuel Samuel and Samuel thought it\nwas Eli so he got up and he went to Eli and he said here I am what can I do for\nyou? Eager to serve. And Eli said I didn't call you. So go back to bed and again it\nhappened and again it happened the third time that voice came and Eli and Samuel\ngot up, went to Eli and said, here I am, you called me and then Eli heard it in his\nown heart. I'm the priest. I should have known this. This should have been my first\nthought. Samuel, that's the Lord speaking to you. When you go back and lie down, if he\ncomes to you again, simply say, well, this is what he said. The Lord came and stood there\ncalling as at other times Samuel, Samuel.\nAnd then Samuel said, what Eli told him to?\nSpeak, Lord, your servant is listening.\nIn short, two things had to happen to change the path\ndown which Israel was going.\nEli, who was birded over his sons,\nknew that something had to happen with them,\nbut he hadn't been powerful enough or strong enough\nto do anything about him.\nAnd Samuel had to be inspired.\ninspired to take that idealism and those ideas and to bring them to a place where he could\ninfluence others. So when he went back to bed, Eli was essentially turning it over to Samuel.\nDon't ask me, tell the Lord you're ready to listen to him. He lay down, the Lord spoke,\nand Samuel responded, speak Lord, your servant is listening, and when he did, the Lord\nkind of unloaded at that point. The Lord spoke again. The vision was there.\nEli was judged, so were his sons. Eli was a pivotal part of this, though,\nbecause he had to inspire Samuel to do the right thing. Find the call, follow it.\nEach of you here serve people of Georgia, but I believe there's an underlying and more\nimportant call for you and for me. Instead of allowing the dream and idealism of people\nto be crushed by the atmosphere that has developed in the political arena all across the spectrum.\nWe need to rise to a level of inspiring young people to service, encouraging their idealism,\ngrooming them for service, for generations to come. We need to be a voice of inspiration that tells\nthem, have them go and say, speak, we're listening, there's something we can do, those simple words,\nSpeak, Lord, for your servant hears you.\nBecome the cry of hope for the future.\nThat's all God wants.\nHe wants to hear us, hear Him.\nHe wants us to call to Him,\nand He wants us to sit and listen when He speaks.\nIt's time for the silence to be broken.\nWe need to dream again.\nWe need to believe again.\nWe need to step up and serve again\nto offer ourselves in service again.\nNot just for the purpose of politics,\nfor offering God faithful integrity-based committed public service. If we don't, we leave the leadership\nto the sons of Eli, the ones who don't hear the voice of God. If we do, we inspire the\nSamuels to come forth. Do you know what Samuel ended up doing? He was the last judge,\nthe last one to serve in that position. He anointed two kings of Israel.\nHe's considered the first of the prophets. He was a priest. He's remembered for his prayers,\nand he laid the groundwork for the later priesthood. What would have happened if he hadn't been\ninspired? What if his dream had been drained out of him? What if he had lost that passion,\nthat desire to do something and to listen? But Eli inspired him. Speak, Lord, your servant is\nhearing. That's what God is calling out from our midst. He's calling you whom we\nhave placed in service to always consider your place in inspiring others to\nserve. Never doing anything or conducting yourselves in any manner that would\ndestroy the innocence of young people or run them from the dream of public\nservice. We need them on the local, state, federal, international level serving.\nNo matter what they're doing, they can serve and you inspire us because of the\nquality of your lives because of the wisdom and because of your dedication here.\nMy dad was fond of an old poem and I'll share it with you. An old man going alone highway\ncame at evening cold and gray to a chasm vast deep and wide, through which was flowing a sullen tide.\nThe old man crossed in the twilight. Damn, the sullen stream had no fear for him,\nbut he turned when safe on the other side and built a bridge to span the tide.\nOh, man, set a fellow pilgrim near, you're wasting your strength building here.\nYour journey will end with the ending day, you'll never pass again this way.\nYou've crossed the chasm deep and wide.\nWhy are you building this bridge at evening tide?\"\nThe builder lifted his old grey head, good friend in the path I've come, he said.\nTheir followeth after me today, a youth whose feet must pass this way.\nThis chasm which has been not to me, to the fair-haired youth may a pitfall be.\ntoo must cross in the twilight, damn good friend, and building the bridge for him.\nYou know, your highest calling of service is more than planning budgets and passing laws\nand building infrastructure.\nYou're building a spiritual infrastructure, a bridge that you can entice, inspire a new\ngeneration of people to rise up and do the right thing and do it well just like you have.\nbe the kind of people that will serve. That bridge will take them across the\ncanyons of hopelessness and anger and truly help them dream of a stronger\nbetter tomorrow and make it happen. As for me, I want my dream and passion back. I'm\nlistening. Who knows what God may call me to do to fulfill the dream at some\npoint, if not, I may be called to encourage and pave the path for others. With\na simple words, remember to say, speak word. Your servant is listening. Speak\nLord, your servant, your servants are listening. Amen. Will you battle with me as we pray?\nSpirit of God, in a moment that honors us to be able to serve, we pray the most important\nprayer of all, thy will be done. On earth as it is in heaven, through my life, as\nthrough others, in the government of this community, of this state, of this\nnation, of this world, and in it all will you plant the seed, speak the voice,\nbreak the silence, and inspire others to come toward this and to see the\nability of the service and to follow the good examples that we set in your precious\nname we offer our prayer. We join me for the Pledge of Allegiance. I pledge\nallegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for\nwhich it stands. One nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\nDoorkeepers will unlock the doors.\nYou\nChair recognizes the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Information and Audits\nChairman Hogan.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nYour Committee on Information and Audits has read the Journal of Apprecious Legislative\nDay and found it to be correct.\nAnd furthermore, Mr. Speaker, I fear the day that technology will suppress our human interaction.\nThe world will have a generation of idiots, Albert Einstein.\nAnd the majority will want to thank you for the scenery and everything, and a great\nseat that I have up here.\nSo thank you, Mr. Speaker.\nYou keep the majority whip on edge when you're giving your report.\nChairman Hogue and the Chair of the Committee on Information and Audits reports that the\njournal, the previous legislative day, has been read and found to be correct.\nIs there any objection to the confirmation of the journal?\nThe Chair here is none in the journal is confirmed.\nThe clerk will read the resolution establishing the order of business for the day.\nMr. Burns, 159, who's following me establishes the order of business that are in first part\nof the period unanimous consent, introduction of bills and resolutions, first reading\nand reference of house bills and resolutions, second reading of bills and resolutions, reports\nof standing committees, third reading and passage of uncontested local bills and resolutions,\nmorning orders.\nIs there any objection to the adoption of the resolution establishing the order of business\nfor the day.

many of us remember between May and November of last year, Atlanta had an increased need because of the protest that occurred.\nHold this for a minute, Representative.\nI can't even hear you up here.\nThis house will be at order.\nIf you're busy and don't have time to listen, then please step out into the any room or the hallway.\nLady May proceed.\nMr. Speaker, I was giving just a reminder here that it was May through November of last\nyear that our law enforcement officers around the state of Georgia were called to come\nto the state capital here and to help with protests, some which turned violent, including\nthe fact that we had the Molotov cocktails thrown into our own Georgia state patrol headquarters.\nAnd so I rise to say thank you and that we recognize here the importance of the role\nthat they play throughout our state and protecting us.\nI also, as a reminder, to some and to inform some of our new\nmembers, it was in 2018 that Georgia passed one of our bills\nthat created the Office of Public Safety Support.\nThat office was a unanimous vote here in the House.\nAnd that office is a peer-driven program to assist officers\nwith mental health, any mental health needs.\nbecause of the role that they play in protecting\nand sometimes they are not treated in the kindest of ways\nand I know that there's an effect on that.\nSo there's a program here now in the state,\nthe Office of Public Safety Support,\nit's a division of public safety,\nit's available to all law enforcement\nand all first responders in Georgia,\nincluding our EMTs and our dispatchers\nand our firefighters,\nso that if they have a need,\nthey can call on the help of their peers\nto help get them through these times of trouble.\nSo again, as our governor said in his state of the state,\nhe said, Georgia backs the blue.\nAnd Georgia does back the blue,\nand I'd like to thank all of our law enforcement officers\nthroughout the state of Georgia.\nChair recognizes
