  "transcript": "Good morning, good morning, it's 8.10 so we're going to go ahead and get started apologize for the delay, but we wanted to be sensitive to the fact that some people are having a slightly harder time getting into the Capitol this morning.\nWelcome to the Senator Preparations Committee meeting, March 27th, 2025.\nWe have one bill on the agenda.\nIt's House Bill 68, and before we get started, Senator Harverson, would you mind leading\nus in an invocation?\nYes, sir.\nFather God, thank you for allowing us to see another day.\nus to be mindful of who is always in charge here in the capital as well as in the world.\nThank you for your blessings, give us safe travel, go on and come in these things we ask\nin Jesus name. Amen. Thank you. House Bill 68 has already been placed in your folders\nand it's on most of your desks, 238 pages that will lay out how the state will spend approximately\n$36, $37 billion over the next 12 months. A taxpayer dollars that we ourselves sell nothing\nto create. They are created by our citizens and the economic activity that they create\nthrough jobs, creation of businesses and industries across our state.\nAnd we're blessed to be in this position to help reallocate some of those funds.\nTerriers that we hope are worthy of that effort.\nThe budget process is not simple, it's not easy, and you know a lot of people are involved.\nFirst need to say thank you to a few of them.\nI appreciate Director Don and Governor Kemp for their efforts this year working with us\neven back into October as we started planning for this budget, they asked for agency requests\nback at that period of time, allowed us to have a little bit of insight into those.\nAnd then prepared their budget they brought forward to us.\nAs you know, Chairman Hatchett in the House, Speaker Burns, who's the carrier of this bill,\nthen picked that, those recommendations up, turned them into what you see here, House\nBill 68.\nAnd Chairman Hatchett, there's a few better to work with.\nI've had the blessing of working with two extremely talented, extremely kind, extremely\ncaring House Chairman, Chairman Terry England, who we're all still thinking of, Prime\n4, and Chairman Matt Hatchett.\nAnd they make my job a lot easier, I'm glad for them.\nThe, I'm glad to be able to work with them.\nThe other group that's so extremely important to this task is our Senate budget, all\nwas headed by Brent Churchill, Austin Trot, and the analysts who are sitting on the front\nrow there. Without them, there is absolutely no way we would have been at this process.\nNow, this budget has been interesting for a variety of reasons that we'll probably\ntalk about, and they have risen to the challenge once again in both the amended and the general\nbudgets, and I am so thankful to work with a team that is so talented, so young, so experienced,\nwilling to give effort whether it be at 1 a.m. in the morning or 1 p.m. in the\nafternoon. I thank you very much for everything you've done to help us get\nhere today.\nYou don't have to read too many headlines to see that the National Outlook is\nsometimes scary. Markets are not what they have been in the past. You can\nusually predict when folks run the bonds. That means one thing. If they run the\ngold, it means something, if they run the stock market, it means a third thing potentially.\nBut right now in the current economy, that's not necessarily, you can't watch what folks\nhave done in the past and predict where we're going to be in the future.\nWhat I can tell you is that in 2019, we were cutting budgets in 2020 when Chairman\nJekyll passed away, we were in a reduction mentality, we thought we were going to have\nto reduce funds.\nWhen we, that changed though after COVID, we had taken 15% out of the budget, you\nstarted there and ended up at 9.5% coming out and then federal spending just\nchanged the entire game. The federal sugar high though now five years later is\nclearly over and we're back to the levels we were in 2019. That's not to say\nthat that's the blame of any individual or any person or any entity. It's\nsimply a realization that all COVID and its COVID federal spending did was\nIt's a lady inevitable for roughly five to six years.\nWhere we stand now, after we've seen double-digit increases in state revenues over the past\na few years, is that we're not at that double-digit level anymore.\nIn fact, you've seen, if we look at this year, we're about 1% 1.8% at times revenue increase\nover the previous year, and that means things are leveling out.\nThey're flattening.\nThe sugar high is ending.\nWe've also seen a string cost increase, whether those cost being labor, those cost being\ngoods and inputs.\nAnd what we've also seen on a national level is an extreme desire by the federal government\nto get its fiscal house in order, a re-alignment of federal funds that's much needed and\nI fully support, and it will impact us.\nIn contrast, you have what we've done here in Georgia for years.\nWe've had a balanced budget.\nWe've been in the low 40s, 40s, 50 states.\nWe've been 40 or below in per capita spending\nand per capita taxation for quite a period of time.\nThat's even after a surge at the local level\nthat we've seen on taxation due to inflation\nand folks from the north to side\nand that the southern climate and the southern way of life\nhas been something that they'd like to experience\na little bit more.\nWe've also been able to continue during this time\nreturn billions to taxpayers, while also continuing to return billions to taxpayers, we've\nbeen able to lower the tax rate, 6 tenths of a percent at this point in time, which is\nroughly $2.4 billion that you will not see recognized in this budget that you would\nhave had we not begun reducing the income tax several years ago. On top of that, you\nhave a commitment to do that again this year. So I think we're standing in great contrast\nbudget wise to where our friends at the federal level have met. We also need to\nrealize though that the federal government didn't get there overnight. They\nborrowed a lot of money. They deficit spent many times. They funded some things\nthat people might call half-baked ideas. But bigger than that I think what they\ndid is they refused to say no. And sometimes in the budget process the hardest\nthing to do, but the most responsible thing to do is you simply have to say no.\nThey didn't push back on its fences, and that's why I ended up in the position that they were over many, many decades.\nWe're not going to do that here at the state level.\nThe Senate's budget that you see before you today,\ncurrently funds our priorities.\nIt funds the needs of our state without issuing more debt,\neven the traditional debt that we've issued in the past.\nAnd we reject the urge to supplant federal funding\nfunding from the COVID era programs like Esther and Arpa that are aspiring this year.\nWe also hold true to funding formulas, whether that means growth or that means reductions,\nand the Senate's budget eliminates some programs.\nIt slows the growth of positions, it questions invoices that are brought to us while they may\nbe good ideas.\nSometimes we think that they lack some portion of explanation and we made the lay those\nfor a period of time.\nThe Senate's budget also prepares for its expenses based on bills we've already passed\nin our assembly this year.\nAnd I think for the group that was meeting subcommittee chairs that had to really comb\nthrough this and work in detail for hours and hours on end, I think that might have been\ntheir biggest takeaway.\nEvery bill we pass, almost every bill we pass, has some fiscal impact.\nAnd we have to decide if we want that impact to the fiscal stability of our state matters\nenough to allow it to go across the General Assembly's floor.\nOur budget takes and highlights in several areas those bills as they pass and calls out\nthe spending that was placed in to support the bills that we passed previously.\nIt's not saying that those bills were a bad idea.\nIt's not saying that the spending is a bad idea.\nWe're simply trying to call to point and remind us that everything we do here has a cost\nand that someone else is normally paying the bill.\nThe budget is laid out in areas that starts with the judicial branch, as you know, it\ngoes to the legislative branch next and then it goes to the executive branch.\nActually, it starts with the legislative branch, goes to the court, something goes to the\nexecutive branch.\nAnd I'm going to explain it and run through it that way too.\nWhen we get to the executive branch, it'll be alphabetical.\nIt's not by how we favoritize different agencies.\nIt's just alphabetical.\nSo I'm going to run through it starting now,\ngive you a little idea of what's up.\nYou can see the legislative budget.\nThere's not a whole lot of ads there,\nmostly for legislative services, very low dollars,\nand you can read through those.\nAt the courts, you're going to see a few more increases.\nThe Senate's proposal begins all positions\nand all raises on January 1st.\nIt eliminates some laudable, but not yet started initiatives.\nAnd it takes and acknowledges the retention needs\nin the prosecuting attorney's council.\nBut it also takes the start of those retention programs\nto January 1st.\nWe also remain true to the formulas, as I mentioned already,\nfor public defenders and prosecuting attorneys,\nand that formula funds one prosecuting attorney,\nand one public defender per superior court judges and circuits.\nalso funds at Chief ADA and of course the DA.\nOne of the more proud items that I have is actually the juvenile courts.\nYou know for the past two or three years we've worked with them on a program to try to\nget some data to help us understand our foster care program and ending termination of parental\nrights when we needed those children to be able to be adopted in a more expedient fashion.\nThe juvenile courts have worked with us well.\nWe asked for data, our Senate budget analyst, Jennifer made this one of her top priorities.\nIt's going to call it a pet project, but it's really more a top priority.\nAnd because we got responses from every single juvenile court, we have not recommended a reduction\nin the juvenile court grants this year.\nMoving to the first executive department, which will be Ag, we acknowledge that there's\nsignificant concern to our state's poultry industry and we tried to fund the\nconcerns there. There was a request for planning for future lab. We took the\nhouse's proposal, studied it in detail. We want to support that initiative as well,\nbut we want to study it a little bit further. So instead of putting the\nplanning and design money in, we've included money instead for planning to\nmake sure we understand exactly what's going to happen with both the capital\nHill Complex and with a state lab needed for agriculture, we support it.\nI want to make sure we just understand that plan first.\nWe did continue to fund the plans that relate to the Capitol Hill\nand for state farmers' market changes.\nWe had an interesting proposal concerning Farrell Hoggs.\nThat's a huge problem for Ag.\nMy analyst are laughing because we brought it up.\nThey thought about it.\nYou know our proposal the proposal brought to us was pins those pins cost about $14,000 each and\nYou know how pins work with feral hogs if you live anywhere outside the metro region\nThe proposal was was relatively expensive about half a million dollars\nWhat we came up with with our subcommittee chairs and others was perhaps a different type of program that would\nbasically incentivized hunters in these areas to create a program to go after\nthat for one fifth of the cost. So again something that I'm glad we were able to\nthink up we want to solve that problem and hopefully we can solve it with less\nstate dollars being used. At the Department of Behavioral Health we have\nfocused our state resources here for many many years you've seen a 25% increase\nI believe in the past five years on spending on mental health resources in our\nstate. The Senate's budget increases the now-comp waivers by 200 and then it\nannualized the funding for another 100-comp waivers. It provides funding for\nthe Making Stabilization Center. We fund one quarter of the Fulton Behavioral\nCrisis Center, one quarter because it's believed to be starting up in Spring\nof next year. That's not a slight to them at all. It's just we don't need to fund\nthat. Start-up cost if we only think it's going to make it through a quarter of\nthe fiscal year. And we continue to focus on forensic beds. We know we have a\nbacklog there, we want to work through that before it becomes more of a crisis situation.\nThe Senate's budget eliminated a contract with a vendor who left state medical providers\nholding the bag for about $2.7 million.\nWe also receded on funding for certain other initiatives that may have been started and\nwe think they're good ideas but at this point in time they need a little bit further analysis.\nWe held the house number for the increases in the Georgia Housing Voucher Program and\ncontinued the Senate's priority for all-tism treatment care and support. In the\nDBA HDD budget we did say no to many worthy endeavors but we're not no\nforever on those endeavors. We just want to make sure that we continue to\nstudy those and see how the fiscal health of the state continues over the\nnext few years. In the Department of Community Affairs there were areas where\nproviders were unable to provide some receipts for previous expenditures and\nso we zeroed out the future funding for those measures.\nWe supported the city of Albany's efforts\nto continue to support its history\nand support childhood learning\nin its plan for its revitalization downtown.\nWe supported the plans of the House and the Governor\nto reduce the number of programs\nthat are in the Department of Community Affairs\nand to consolidate others for better resource provisions\nto our citizens.\nWe also reduced the funds at two of our largest state\neconomic development programs being one Georgia and REBA.\nThose have been plused up over the years\nby different legislative ads since we're now at a point\nthat we need to begin re-assessing our spending ourselves.\nWe pull some of those legislative ads\nto return those back to base number figures.\nAt the Department of Community Health rather,\nwe did support the house increase on provider rates\nfor primary care and dental care codes,\nbut we did it at half the amount that the house had added.\nWe supported the ABA therapy rate increase at 3% and we supported the full increase for\nneonatologist and maternal fetal medicine rate increases.\nWe did not support the rate increases for ventilators, speech, or durable medical equipment.\nAt EMS, we supported a 5% rate increase for 7 EMS codes and we funded the increase\nto begin transportation reimbursement at mile six.\nThe Board of Dentistry, interesting things that we came into as we dove into that matter.\nThere's some new leadership over there and we actually have some concerns related to\nsafety at the Department of the Board of Dentistry and we are going to address those with\nfunding slightly less than the house's level but we are going to have to provide some things\nincluding protective equipment, security equipment at the Board of Dentistry.\nThe Senate's budget also funds two additional federally qualified health centers and we support\nsickle cell research at a mountain lesser than the then the house did, but we recognize\nover 28 million in base spending on sickle cell help and resources to support the treatment\nof this disease.\nThe Senate supports $1 million addition for PTSD and wraparound services related to\nGeorgia's veterans and supporting their families.\nWe continued the governors, the House and the Senate's practice of moving skilled nursing\nfacilities forwarded on their audited cost reports.\nAnd I think that's something that we're very proud that we've been able to do for the\npast few years, and it's important that we continue to do that so that that number does\nnot become instrumentable in future years.\nFor pharmacy matters, the Senate agreed with the House and held $3.1 million to support\nour independent pharmacies in the State Health Benefit Plan.\nWe also added an additional $5 million by moving about $3.5 million out of U.S.G.\nover two DCHs combining it with $1.2 million that the House had already added for $5 million\nreimbursement for drugs, dispensed to persons for self-administration in an amount equal\nto the national average drug acquisition cost that most people refer to as the NADAC.\nThe Senate's budget includes and supports 150 new residency spots, and it instructs the\nDepartment of Community Health to file a state plan amendment for the use of Medicaid reimbursements\nto maximize Georgia dollars in graduate medical education, similar to what's being done\nin the state of Florida and we understand when Florida filed for their state plan amendment\nthat was approved very quickly in about 60 days.\nThe Department of Corrections, remember that we met on the Department of Corrections\nand their budget before the governor ever gave us his proposal this year.\nAnd that was with his help.\nHe gave us the Department of Corrections numbers earlier, early commissioner Oliver has been\nvery transparent to let us know that he has an issue with staff and retention there and\nneeds some significant resources to even manage the locks.\nOur body has also been focused on technology related to contraband entering the facilities.\nAnd we've been focused on contraband banning contraband and making sure that cell phones\ndid not work inside those facilities.\nThe governor's budget had an increase of roughly 125 million in base budget items for\nthe Department of Corrections.\nThe House's proposal carried that number up to roughly 250 million over the base number\nfor corrections, and the Senate's number falls somewhere in between.\nWe didn't take all of the house ads, we're slightly higher than the governor, and we end\nup with roughly $170 million in additional base funding for the Department of Corrections\nto address retention, to address staffing, to address security related to locks and gates,\nand to address technology moving forward in the future.\nthe Department of Driver Services, the Senate acknowledged the use of technology by the\nDepartment and supported that use by requesting evidence that that use is allowed them to\nreduce their need for additional personnel in the future.\nAt the Georgia decal, the Department of Early Child Learning, we support the Governor and\nHouse's recommendation for 500 additional caps funded slots.\nRemember, we've now maxed out the federal funds in caps,\nso we're completely on state funds for this measure,\nand we serve about 50,000 children statewide\nthrough that program.\nWe continue to fund our pre-key programs,\nand we agree with the House and the Governor\nfor $14 million to continue the phased-in reduction\nof class sizes from 20 to 22.\nAt the Department of Economic Development,\nwe recognize base funding,\ninstead of increasing funds at the Martin Luther King Center.\nWe have base funds there, I believe,\nof 250,000 or 500,000.\nIt's written on the line, I apologize,\nI don't remember right now.\nAnd we delayed support for Super Bowl 62\nand the 2031 NCAA, NCAA Final Four\nfor the same reasons that we stated in the amended budget.\nOne events, three years away, one event, six years away.\nWe do support those programs\nand want to make sure that we provide\nnecessary security there. I want some more explanation about the infrastructure\nrequested. But again, if we're going to fund those programs, we believe the\nstate should keep the interest on those dollars rather than paying those out\nand allowing those dollars to be the interest to be kept at other entities.\nIn the Department of Education, we continue to fully fund the QB teaching\nformula. We did reduce funding again for testing and ask that those\nnumbers could be true up in the amended budget if more PSAT or other AP tests are given.\nAnd we took reductions based on utilization in various different categories. We increased\nfunds for character education. And we funded a Senate bill that passed last year concerning\nschool supplies, but did it at a different figure than had previously been discussed with\nthe House. The House have funded the measure. We believe that the best way to engage communities\nin their schools is to have seed funding from the state that would fund this program at\na 25% level and allow for matching funds either from the local, the LEA, the local education\nagency, or from civic organizations in the same community.\nliteracy. This has been an initiative of the Senator from the 4th and really the\nSenate as a whole for many years and we appreciate Speaker Burns and Miss\nDel Burns and their focus on this area too. We've probably made the so much\nprogress because of their involvement. I'm not sure we would have been nearly as\nfar down this road had the Senator from the 4th and the Speaker and Miss Del\nnot been so focused. There's someone else who deserves a lot of credit for that\nAnd that's another one of our Senate budget analysts, Lindsay, who made this one of her\ntop priorities to tackle.\nThe Senate's budget agrees with all of the House dollars added in literacy.\nWe do not change a single dollar.\nWe do not reduce a single dollar.\nWe do not true up a single dollar.\nWe agree and support the House's ads as it relates to literacy fully.\nIn student services, we did have some differences though.\nThere was a house initiative related to student mental health.\nThe Senate's not yet ready based on bills that are currently pending here to fund a database\nprogram there.\nWe zeroed that out, but it's not, we also zeroed out some funding that you'll see in student\nservices related to mental health, but it's not as zero as a whole.\nWhat you will actually see is we took that funding, we combined part of it with the program\nfunding we already have for school mental based health health services in the\nApex program move those out of DBHD and move them all over to the school\nsecurity program because we do think that mental health is part of school\nsecurity. We chose not to support the $28 million house targeted ad for\neconomically disadvantaged support programs and choosing instead to\nrecognize the over $1.5 billion in base funding support for this effort.\nWe did support and increased funds for about $12.5 million total for out of school care.\nAnd in the Senate's biggest budget move, we fully supported and fully funded the promised\nscholarship at 1% of QBE, which is $141 million.\nwill allow for 21,000 students and their families to have options to pick other schools when\nthe school that they're attending falls in the bottom quartile of schools otherwise in\nthe state.\nAn employee's retirement system, the house had a line for about $23 million for state employees\nand state retirees rather, and payments to them, then it's been a lot of discussion\nI know about coalists in this building for a while.\nThe Senate Committee increased this amount to almost $76 million for annual payments to\nstate retirees to help with record high inflation.\nThey've experienced over the past half decade and to improve the funded ratio, which is\nnecessary if they're ever going to be able to restart that COLA program again.\nAt the Department of Human Services, I really want to highlight an efficiency here.\nFor many, many years, we had added money's millions of dollars year over year to a contract\nthat we had with a Georgia based company\nto verify labor and wage data.\nLast year, we had an employee in the Department\nof Human Services come to us and say,\nI think we can do this better.\nThis contract continues to increase.\nI think I can write a program that would allow us to simply\nbid out to a lowest cost essentially like a reverse auction\nto verify labor and wage data because of the success\nof that program and the reduction in federal fines\nthat we were assessed when that previous company got it wrong,\nwe're going to be able to reduce the department\nof human services budget by a little over $2 million.\nAt GBI, you'll see that the state will continue\nto fund the making improvements.\nWe will continue to fund lab equipment\nand based on an innovative approach\nby the subcommittee chair over that area,\nWe're going to purchase five portable mass spectrometers\nto assist in getting quicker results for ADAs\nand other departments related to drug proving\nthat certain drugs are the drugs they said they were,\nwhich we believe will help us also move faster\nand get more efficiencies in our criminal justice system.\nThe Senate budget also includes $100,000\nfor the cold case unit.\nIt's reduction from the house, but it's an increase to the base fund.\nAs CJCC, the criminal justice coordinator in council, we did not replace the loss of federal\nfunds, but we did acknowledge anticipated federal funds for core services for victims\nof crimes, which allows us to pull back on some of the increases you may have seen in the\nhouse budget for a state funding there.\nWe're going to promote efficient season this item as well, and this agency, we believe\nthat the 24-hour human trafficking hotline can be done with resources that the G-SAC,\nwhich would allow us to continue that 24-7 hotline without needing to increase additional\nstate funds.\nAt the Department of juvenile justice, we're really proud of the commissioner and the\nwork she's done here.\nWe want to support her work and we'll fund a 4% salary increase, almost across the\nboard in that agency, with 8% increases in certain fields that we see the potential\nfor a lot higher turnover.\nAt the Department of Labor, we pause some spending there just to give the Commissioner\ntime to prepare her plan moving forward.\nAt the Department of Law, we pull back slightly on the number of positions, but it remains\nsupportive of the gang prosecution units and it's spent some human trafficking units into\nAugusta and into Macon.\nWe transferred $50,000 out of the Department of Law over to the Judicial Council based\non testimony by the Judicial Council that the Department of Law may not have been able\nto represent them based on conflicts with the branches of government and the Department\nof Natural Resources.\nWe left $1 million for beach restoration, pulled the remaining three.\nWe funded $349,000 for a matter related to offshore reef fishing and complications there\nwith federal surveys that are really beginning to impact commercial fishing and tourism in\nthat area.\nat the Environmental Protection Division,\nwe streamline the contracting process\nand allow the state to save another $581,000 there.\nWe pull back increases for the venison processing\nand chronic waste disease programs.\nWe think both are important,\nbut they have base funding\nand we recognize that base funding in both of those items.\nAt the Department of Public Health,\nwe removed funds and eliminated the Georgia Coordinating\nCouncil that was roughly $3 million.\nRemember it was something we stood up during COVID.\nWe've now pulled out the base funds and ended that program.\nWe transferred duties that may have been assigned to that council elsewhere.\nAnd we took the opportunity to help reduce cost in the future by funding something related\nto viral hepatitis.\nIf we can treat, catch and treat that disease early, the cost savings is immense.\nIf we do not catch that disease early, then you're obviously looking or likely looking\nat a liver transplant.\nmany of those liver transplants end up being funded through our Medicaid program.\nWe want to catch that early and see if we can prevent those calls to the future.\nAt the Department of Public Safety, we continue to be careful on additional staff, and we recognize\npayments from the Chiefs of Police and Sheriff's in the amended budget rather than adding them\nto base budgets, and we're committed to continuing that for transparency purposes in the future.\nWe supported the retention plan at the Public Service Commission, and in the Board of Regents\nbudget we reduced funds for the Georgia Cyber Center to continue to allow it to\nstand on its own as it was designed to do so with rent proceeds. We did not\nsupport the addition of the microgrants program but we did support the\ntechnology research additions into the peanut industry. We kept the house cut\nto the public law schools but we returned the base funding for the legal\nclinics also at those law schools and we were decreased base funding in various\nprograms that had been begun in previous cycles, past cycles by the General Assembly, and\nas time's going on, we wondered if those still needed to be continued and we reduced several\nof them. We reduced expenditures to projections for the\nForest Land Protection Grant Program at the Department of Revenue. The Department of Revenue\nstill believes it's going to be completely fine for funding this program. Just you've seen\nin the past that the grants have decreased,\nless qualified, less counties qualified\nor qualified at lesser amounts,\nso we pulled back some base funding there.\nAt the Secretary of State's office,\nwe did provide $600,000 to fund the State Elections Board,\nand we added language to certain boards\nthat are attached to the Secretary of State,\nrelated to their rent to help encourage them\nand push them forward on seeking rent at reduced rates.\nThe Department of Transportation, we continue to do\nutilization of the motor fuel for most construction\nand maintenance matters.\nAnd we held the House Edition for Airport 8.\nWe also had one request that we did fund $2 million\nrequested by members of this body for transportation\nimprovements at the Combo and CID area.\nIn veterans, we added $3.5 million\nfrom various veterans to related care items.\nand we're extremely excited about the sub-acute carrying unit coming online very soon.\nIn capital projects, usually what we would see on state bonds, we did not fund those with bonds,\nwe funded those with cash moving closer to the governor's proposal on capital projects.\nWe disagreed with the House on that bond plan overall and again I told you\nand opting instead to fund these with cash.\nAnd we also delayed some capital projects for savings\nthat we thought would be better funded elsewhere.\nThat one of those capital projects was at AG.\nAnother one was at the Department of Geoval Justice.\nWhen you flip through the budget,\nyou know the capital projects right at the end.\nYou're not gonna see very many ads for the house or the Senate.\nAnd I think that's something that the legislature overall\nneeds to become more accustomed to.\nAs you see that 1% to 1.8% growth line in the future,\nand you've seen, and we've talked about the additions\nthat you're gonna need for corrections,\nthe none as we put there this year are annualized now,\nbut they're probably looking at additional annualized funds\nin the future.\nI think you're gonna see our capital,\nits expenditures continue to get smaller.\nOf those ads, one of them that you will see\nis an added funding for design at Augusta Tech.\nAnd we funded the UNG project with alternate fund sources.\nThe Senate's budget did one thing slightly different this year.\nIt's only informational.\nMany times we hear comparisons of our state to others related to the state income tax.\nAnd that's very, very, very comparison.\nAnd the question you get from any constituents is, hey, why can Florida or Texas or Tennessee\neliminate the state income tax in Georgia can't. Well Georgia can. And if you look on the\nfirst page of your budget after the green sheets, the Senate budget office helped me compile\na list of tax credits and tax exemptions that we already pay for at our state. And if\nIf you add those up, that is more than we collect in our state income tax.\nI'm not suggesting as a policy that we should eliminate all these, but I am telling you,\nevery time we pass another one, we make it harder to eliminate the state income tax.\nFurther, if you look at some of these items, they're big, big numbers.\nThe first one is 12.2 billion.\nFor purposes of understanding only, please know that we collect roughly 16 billion total\nin individual income tax.\nSo sales and use taxes exemptions, we do not tax services.\nThat's a policy decision of our state, and I'm not suggesting we move otherwise, but\nthink about it.\nWe don't tax it when the plumber comes to your house, when the person's fixing your car,\nwhen the person's building your house, you don't get a sales tax bill for their labor.\nIn Texas, you do 6.25%.\nIf Georgia wants to move in that direction instead, we can eliminate our state income tax.\nBut we're going to have to look at how Texas makes that up.\nAnd I wanted to provide for you this graph to show you exemptions that Georgia has that\ncertain ones of our other states may be surrounding states may be do not.\nThe total of that list there well eclipses the amount of\nmonies that we bring in in state income tax.\nSo that's just there for information purposes in case we\nwant to continue this discussion and move it forward\nlater on.\nIn closing, I need to tell you thank you so much.\nThis is the sixth year you've allowed me to cheer the budget\non your behalf.\n11th budget that you've allowed me to help write for our state.\nAnd it is truly an honor.\nnever gets easier, but because of your input, your involvement, and your constant support,\nit's a bearable task, and the Senate budget office staff are incredibly, incredibly\nadept at helping answer your questions and help you do the best job you can to represent\nyour districts individually and then our state and its fiscal health overall.\nSo thank you for allowing me to do this again this year, and I'm happy to take any questions\nyou may have. Senator Karpacic. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I wanted to personally thank you\nfor your support of the data project for the juvenile courts. And I'm very happy that\nthe juvenile court clerks have responded. I understand there are still some issues\nwith some of the counties where the Superior Court clerks do the reporting and I wondered\nif you could address that. Yes, ma'am. There are. You're correct.\nWe did get responses from every court.\nSo some of those came in via jump drive.\nThere is a portal that the General Assembly,\nyour body has already funded that allows\nfor a digital submission of all that data.\nIt's able to be submitted with redacted information\nso we don't have a scare of personal information\ngetting out.\nThe jump drives are not safe as that on that.\nSo if there are any clerks listening,\nI hope you'll please take a look at the J-Cats program\nthat we are funding for you at the state level.\nWe have had a little, a small issue with superior court clerks\nbeing a little bit slower to update to the process,\nbut we're again, so thankful that the president\nof the Superior Court clerks council this year,\nand the new management that you have\nat the Superior Court clerks council\nhas been extremely willing to discuss\nthat issue with us and move it forward.\nYes, ma'am.\nThe Dean of the Senate, Senator Harbson.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nYou mentioned something about cell phones\nat the Department of Corrections and the staffing issues.\nWe look at it ways to get that up.\nOf course, as we heard in the committee hearings,\nit's pretty darned and want to get up\nand it's a safety issue for the law enforcement people\nthere in that kind of way.\nAnd secondly, have we determined, is that in legal way,\nWe can ban the cell phones or is that legal or how does that work because we've heard that before that you couldn't do it so right we are working on that with our federal partners we are not allowed to completely jam everything in that area which I think is what you and I would prefer to take take care of the problem from the beginning chairman albers has been instrumental in going through every not just line item but every invoice related to that.\nto those items you discussed and without his help I'm not sure that we could have\nfinished this part of the budget and there's an expedited version that we did.\nWell, I'm sure we can't keep looking at that because I just got the impression that\nthat's a real serious problem that we can we need to look at. And thank you\nfor the 28 million by sickle cell. I just always look at that.\nbase funding. Right. Okay. All right. Great. Great. Thanks. Thanks. Fun. You're not a majority of that\nis in Medicaid care. As Chairman Harrison brought up, I want this body to remember you're going to\nbe required to put additional dollars into corrections next year. So be thinking about that as you\nmove forward and think about your request as you're back in your district after session. Chairman\nThank you, Mr. Chairman, I just want to make a comment.\nThe last few years I've been able to be a subcommittee chair and I just want to thank you for all your hard work and your staff, Caroline Hicks did a great job as my analyst.\nYour analysts are really good and your team's very good and I just want to say thank you and it's been an honor to serve as one of your subcommittee chairs and I know we all had to take tough cuts.\nI mean, I was talking to the senator from the 56.\nI had to take tough cuts in economic development.\nI don't think there's a department that didn't have to take\na little bit of a haircut, but you did it in the right way.\nAnd I just want to say thank you, you've done a great job.\nThank you, any credit for the staff, though.\nIt doesn't need to go to me.\nAny is good at Austin and to Brent.\nThey do the hiring and management.\nAnd I'll tell you, those analysts also, I say those analysts,\nthey're sitting right there.\nThey are so independent and their ability to grasp\non to an issue and move forward.\nYou can't teach that.\nThey're just an extremely impressive route.\nChairman Walker.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nI want to echo what Senator Beach is saying.\nI had the opportunity to sit with you several hours\nthrough this process.\nAnd I have in years past, thankfully,\nbeen able to be part of the process.\nAnd I'm consistently impressed with your knowledge\nof the budget and your wisdom and your compassion\nand your thoughtfulness and the way you approach this\nand your willingness to take input from all the senators\nand try to do your best to address their priorities.\nAnd I just can't thank you enough.\nAnd again, your staff's just really, really incredible\nand super helpful.\nI appreciate you highlighting in your overview line 100.4,\nwhich deals with drug dispensing costs.\nWe're adding $5 million.\nThis issue of fairness with independent pharmacies\nversus chain pharmacies and PBMs is something\nthe Senate has grappled with for years.\nIt's a priority of the Lieutenant Governor\nand a priority of the Senate to get this right.\nWe've got a bill on the floor today, House Bill 196\nthat we need to pass clean that is going to, I think,\nfairly address this issue.\nI wanted to point out to the members\nthat the $5 million is, a lot of that\nis initial cost in setting up this program.\nWe do anticipate some savings in the future,\nbecause this will put a ceiling on the,\nwe're using the Nadak pricing formula.\nand we think we're gonna have some savings\nbecause we're putting a ceiling on the cost\nof prescription drugs that we'll have a floor\nand a ceiling and it will restore fairness\nfor our independent pharmacies.\nAnd I thank you for your leadership on this.\nThank you, Chairman Walker.\nYou're right, that $5 million is only 1.2 million\nadditional state funds.\nWe pulled 3.8 million out of the USG program\nof savings we expect we'll have in pharmacies there.\nI'll tell you all these kind of words.\nI checked my pulse for a second.\nI don't know if I was out of my eulogy or not.\nSenator Williams walks in here in a second,\nI'm gonna get scared.\nChairman Albers.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nI wanna add to the compliments,\nspecifically around the not taking a bond package out.\nAt a time where we've got extraordinary reserves\nthat are undesignated as well as already day fund,\nthe great budgeting that's happened\nfrom the governor of the Senate and the House.\nI wanna applaud you and the committee's work on\nsaying we're not going to take out bonds when we have this type of funds available and\nbeing good fiscal conservators.\nI think it's a great posture as we continue to demonstrate to other states what can be\ndone while they're reeling with record deficits.\nSo, well done.\nWell, with Robertson, Mr. Chairman, first of all, I want to say I'm glad you were able\nto absorb all those compliments and the good words and we'll try to get it back on track\nover hand. I did I did see in here where there's a I think it's a little less than a million\ndollar appropriation for a new tower and equipment associated with that for I believe\nis it Georgia public broadcasting that's in there. It's in the bond package. It's in the\nbond package right and it's not the bond package. The capital projects that normally would\nbe bonds that we're funding with cash, correct?\nYes, sir.\nCan I ask you a question?\nWhat's the overall investment we're making\ninto Georgia for broadcasting in this budget?\nOh, man, why'd you ask me that one?\nAnd the question was, you were loving all the love so much.\nYou'd have to go to the border regions.\nYes, sir.\nIn border regions budget, you'd go to public broadcasting.\nLet's see here.\nI need to get one of my animals saying I can go to the next question while they're\nlooking.\nRight before the partner revenue. Sorry. Let me go to my line on that 307. I'm a 301. I haven't gone quite far enough yet.\nMy mortality is showing\n13.2 million dollars. Thank you. And\nOf the QBE fully funded. First of all, I want to thank you for that. And is is any of that?\nDid the study committee change any of that formula put to this point or were continuing to work under the way we have been?\nyears passed. We would not change anything with that formula. We did change things related\nto the non-QBE formulas. Yes, sir. Well, and finally, very uncareistically. I want\nto thank you so much for all the work you've done with the Georgia Department of Corrections.\nI understand that even though it doesn't seem like that, we're working with limited funding\nto take care of something that I think has been neglected for many years and I appreciate\nhow aggressive and how forthright you've been throughout this process to make sure those\nproblems could be solved and while I appreciate the 4% I do look forward in years\nforward that that we can continue to increase the environment that our\nstate employees work in in our prisons and also increase the pay and benefits\nthat they receive for doing a job that 99% of Georgians would never want to do\nand thank you so much for that. Well thank you again and you and Chairman\nAlbers for what you did in the all session to help set this up again I think we\nWe have a mission that we have to make sure we're promoting the safety of our employees,\nof those who are in our custody, and also the public at large.\nChairman, kind of a talk today.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nGreat job.\nI move for a previous question on House Bill 68.\nThere's been a motion, is there a second?\nSecond, any further discussion?\nAll those in favor, please say aye.\nOpposed, no.\nAnd it passed unanimously.\nThank you so much.\nWe stand adjourned.\nYou\n",
