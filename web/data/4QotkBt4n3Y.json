  "transcript": "you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you are say that I met him during an environmental rally. He also gave me a certificate and money for my schooling and that was the CT Vivienne Awards. So I just want him to come up and give us his work for today and then, and he's here, Dr. Daly. Thank you. Welcome, good to have you. Thank you. Good morning. I finally arrived in the big house. All of these years, I've been passing by wondering what do they do in there. And sometimes you wonder what did I do out there. But when we can get out there with the end there, we got something for the state of Georgia and we ought to be proud in the name of the Lord. Let me say a good morning to all of you and certainly to speaker Burns and Tishnakes for inviting me to come this morning. And I wonder whenever you're asked to say something with a distinguished body like this, what can you really say? And I've often known that when you're in doubt as to what you should talk about, you need to ask somebody. So I asked my son, what should I talk about? And he said, well, come on, Dad, just say anything to him. They're all right. Then I turned to my daughter and I said, what should I talk about? She said, well, Dad, be erudite. It's a distinguished body. And then I turned to speaker Burns and I said, what should I speak about? He said, speak about five minutes and sit down. We've got a lot of things to do today. We live in a world that seems to pull us all in so many different directions. And at the same time, we feel so overwhelmed. Well, I stopped by just for a few moments to offer a word of assurance that with all of the decisions that you have to make for the citizens of Georgia, how you can feel a certain inner peace in today's mayhem. Can you imagine never having to feel any anxiety when you come into this chamber? It seems like that possibly might be an impossibility. We all have worries on the job in our homes with our families and even wondering, sometimes did we make the right vote after we've cast the vote? Well, there is a solution, I think, to possibly when you come into this chamber and you feel all the distressors around you every day, just getting through the traffic, sitting in your seat, wondering what should I do, what side should I vote for? It's a stressful situation. And there was a young man named Apostle Paul. Can I use Apostle Paul in the sanctuary? Can I talk from the Bible in the sanctuary? I don't know. Sometimes there's a block under the door, but I got to do it because that's who I am. In Philippians 4th chapter, verses 6 to 8, here's what the Apostle Paul says about the reduction of stress, the reduction when there's something in your mind and your body that's challenging you, when all of the worries of the world seem larger than the mountains and the valleys are deep, you wonder, what can I do here with the Apostle Paul says? Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, present your request to God and the peace of God which transcends all understanding with God, your hearts and your minds in Christ. In other words, when you read this particular paricka, when you read this text, Paul is saying this, he's given each of us a way to face stressful days with peace. Paul is saying what I want to share with each of you today, this beautiful morning, every legislative session you were, you have the awesome responsibility of accepting to meet the needs and expectations of those who sent you here. However, there will be times when you're conscious with challenge or decision which you may or may not have agreed upon. These are the times that filled you with anxiety. Paul is saying, don't worry, don't be anxious, don't become stressed. But do what we are going to do in a few moments and that is pray, the simple obligation to communicate with the God that listens to all that we do, a God that gives us the peace that surpasses all understanding and that peace will guide you even in the middle of the decision making. Where you find a certain commons and you know that you're in the right world at the right time for the right reason for the right purpose, bringing hopefully the right results for the citizens of Georgia. When you have that feeling down inside that you're doing the best that you can do, that's all that you can do. And that's what we're here to talk about. We're thanking God for the opportunity to serve every day when you get up, you come in, you wonder, but if you've got in your mind that I am a servant, God sent his son to serve and not to be a servant, not to be served, he sent him to be a servant. You are public servants who accepted the call to serve. However, to be effectively fulfill your calling, you must not lean on your own understanding, not on your own limited human understanding, but trust God to guard your heart and your mind in a nation, in a state divided on so many different ideological fronts, the people are looking for public servants, not ideologues who are running for their own particular self-angrildism, but simple public servants. You now must begin to create and establish and maintain something that seemingly is being lost in our nation. One of the obligations to be a public service is to develop trust among those who sent you here to serve them. It's there filled with so many fears, apprehensions and anxiety, but trusting God, your creator is a sustainer. When all comes in and you don't know which way to turn, don't look to the left, don't look to the right, don't look down at the shoes, but look up to something that's miter than any of us, a deity that will hold you in the palm of the hand. When doubt comes in, the only way that you can remove doubt is to have a power inside of you that gives you the strength. God did not give you the power of fear, but of a sound mind. This morning I asked that each of you would not see this as just another chaplain getting up here running. It's my off talking and getting excited, but this is a moment when each of you can make a decision within. How do I effectively go down deep down into the resources of my very soul, my mind, my heart, my body, and do make a difference, even though I might disagree with somebody across the aisle. How do we come together for the overall good of the state of Georgia? Not just another chaplain coming and then going back to business. Well, we pass that. What's for lunch? Sometimes something ought to be said from this day of us that makes me think. That makes me reorder my thinking as to how I respect and how I treat the other person, how I overcome the stressors in my life to go. This is the only day God has given each of us to seek divine His divine guidance in will. As you legislate this session, make your decisions after you pray, meditate, listen, and obey that creative spiritual force that is down inside of each of us, the spirit that I will continue to serve. One of the ways to do that I found whenever I'm in doubt, many mornings, even though I've been out on the field a long time, started in the Civil Rights Movement in 1959. I'm 82 years, 81 years old now. So I've been on the, here's another thing. Don't sing anymore. I'm on the battlefield. Don't ever. You're not on the battlefield. You're in the battle. It's the difference between being on the battlefield and in the battle. So we're in the battle and the only way to win in the battle is to have a general, general God. And general God will lead you in the battle to free victories. And that's what we want here. So we adjoin with me as we communicate with an Almighty God. Somebody ought to say, man, somebody ought to be thankful that the stress is less now. Stress is less. Almighty divine righteous God, the giver of every good and perfect excellent gift. It is once again that you've us summoned us to this powerful\n\nchamber, public servants, those that have committed themselves and their lives and their spirits to make a difference in this great state. This legislative body, God, individually, collectively, we ask that you would touch them and allow them to put their egos on the altar and crush and seek your divine guidance for governing your people. Dear God, I ask that you would bless their families. Touch them when they come to this place as chamber of power. Bless their families, bless their children, bless their wives, bless their daughters, bless all in their families that they can feel the assurance that their father, their mother, their uncle, their cousin is doing the right thing at the right time for the right reason for the right purpose to get the right result. Touch them, give them less and all fear right now and certainly God remove all stress. Even through the day after these words have been uttered. These mere human words, let that stress go down, go down, go down. And if you, God, we ask a special blessing this morning, our friend, President Jimmy Carter, God, go down there to play, touch rousing right now, Jason and the rest of the family, God, give them the assurance that everything not will be all right, that everything is all right. This legendary leader, this son of Georgia, God, touching right now, you told us don't worry about this little earth and tabernacle. But God, like the people in this chamber, I asked that you would touch his spirit to let him know that it is all right. If you let your finger of love touch him and God, I ask a special blessing for the people in Turkey and Syria, 40, 50,000 people wiped out in one fail earthquake. We come and we lose one or two in our lives, but all those people bless them as they face those cold conditions. Finally, God, I ask that you would bless my good friend Charlie Fleming, who is retiring in the Labor Department. Bless all that he has done for so many years in this place. And now empower this legislature body with wisdom, insight, compassion, caring, honesty, decency, and a sense of enjoying what they're doing. I ask for your total involvement on this day, God, touch him right now, let them feel a certain urging that from this day forward, this will not just be a chamber where we come that we've been elected, but this will be a chamber of transformation for making Georgia still one of the greatest states in the nation. And we ask it all in the name who understood what it meant to just lift it off, lift off the problems, lift off the stress, give it to God and God will give it back to you. And we ask it all in a powerful name of a living, living, risen savior and all those in the room who said, Amen, amen, let us salute the flag. Amen, thank you. Revolent and dearly we appreciate those words of encouragement. Thank you. They're well received. Doorkeepers will unlock the doors. May great chaplain early in the South Annie Room.

This is a bill that reflects on our retiree program. It's an old program that is no longer in effect, but it would allow the beneficiaries of life insurance to assign the benefits to the funeral home. I've passed this bill last year and it didn't get out of the Senate. And it basically does will allow those beneficiaries to pay directly to the funeral homes. Are there any questions? The lady has a question. Chair recognizes Representative Bentley for a question. Yes, ma'am. Thank you, Madam Speaker. That's the gentle lady yield. I do. Isn't it not true that I am extremely excited that age house bill 317 is being presented today and the strawberry queen is going to be so very excited when all of members of the House of Representatives vote yes for house bill 317 on behalf of the funeral home caucus of Georgia.

The Georgia annotated the public retirement system's investment authority law so as to raise the limit for the total percentage of funds that the employment retirement system of Georgia may invest in an alternative investment. This bill haven't referred to the committee on retirement. That committee recommends the disbiddle do pass. The chair recognizes, I'm not sure I recognize this name, representative Franklin to present the bill. Thank you, Madam Speaker. Members of the assembly, on your desk, you will see a letter that's written from the director of the employment retirement systems of Georgia in full request of this bill and full support of the bill. I also want to add that it flew through committee with unanimous support. But this bill would amend provisions relating to the public retirement system investments authority law. Current law authorizes most eligible large retirement systems to invest up to 10% of their assets in alternative investments. However, the employment retirement system is limited to a 5% investment in alternative investments. If this legislation is enacted, the limited limitation currently placed on the employment retirement systems would be removed and the system would be authorized to invest up to 10% of their assets in alternative investments. So I ask your full support consideration of the bill and I'm Speaker, I yield the well. Not so fast. The gentleman has some legitimate questions. Chair recognizes Chairman Smith to your right or to your left for question. Does the gentleman yield? I yield. Is it not true that this is your first bill on the floor? It is. And is it not further true that although we may share the same alma mater that you are indeed a freshman? It is true. And is it not further true that we've led without this legislation until you got here? That is true. Aren't you glad that I arrived? The gentleman further yield. So it's your position here today that we cannot live without it since you got here. It is as the gentleman speaks. Thank you. Chair recognizes Representative Martin for question. Do you write? I mean, you'll for question. I yield. Don't you think we, isn't it true that we'd be better off in this world if we treated all things equally and we could all get along? In some cases, yes. You don't believe that in all cases. You clearly don't believe it in this case, isn't it true? Because in your bill, you only address large retirement systems. I'm wondering if the gentleman could tell the house what he has against small, medium, and extra large systems. And after you do that, can you tell me exactly what a large retirement system is and what's the difference between it and a medium and extra large? Well, a large system is a large system. A medium system is a medium and a small is a small. But with this large system, it is imperative that we pass this bill so that they can have a better return on their investment. Chair recognizes Representative Mom to him for question. Thank you, Madam Speaker. This is gentleman Yeal. I yield. I was looking at the documentation for your bill today from the great gentleman or state auditor, Mr. Greg S. Griffin. What I see that this letter is addressed to a chairman Carson and my eyes aren't good, but I don't see a chairman Carson out there. Can you explain yourself? Yes, sir. Thank you for that question. Chairman Carson is in full support of this bill and he was very much like you to vote for it. Then it's a great bill. Thank you, sir. Chair recognizes for a last question Representative McDonald. To your right. Thank you, Madam Speaker. I yield. I've taken House Bill 285 and I want you to set it flew through committee. So if this does not fly, can we vote against your bill? I'll go with that. All right. Just want to test. Oh, it's perfect. It's great. Mr. There's a speaker on the well. You know the questions and the gentleman has yielded the well. Thank you. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is not in the previous question is ordered.

Clerk will read the caption House bill 203, House bill 203. House bill 203, but resident of Newton, the 127th and others to be entitled to amend chapter 12 with Title 31 of the official go to Georgia and Taterley in the control of hazardous conditions preventable diseases and metabolic disorders so as to revise provisions relating to restrictions on the sale and dispensing of contact lenses with respect to physicians. This bill I refer to the committee on health. That committee recommends a disbile do pass. Chair recognizes representative Newton to present the bill. Thank you Madam Speaker. And thank you colleagues. It's good to be here. I know we were all challenged by the chaplain. I know I was this morning to come ways we can work together just to better the lives of our fellow Georgians. I know each of us brings our area of expertise, our committee service that we volunteered for, we got assigned to. We all want to make a difference in the lives of others. This is one area of health care that I work in a little bit and what this particular bill does is expand an option for telemedicine. Much of telemedicine we tried in the during the pandemic. It's appropriate for some things but it's not appropriate for others and sometimes we've had to learn the hard way when that's appropriate. But it can't be tremendously important in our rural areas but it doesn't mean it's unimportant with our suburban and urban areas. House bill 203 in particular looks to expand the option for Georgians who wear contact lenses for vision correction, correction. The technology as well as our comfort level, both the patient and the provider and telemedicine is increased since we last addressed I care in 2015. Over the past two and a half years we've gotten valuable input from really all areas of I care professionals. We've gathered this from optometrist to prescribe most of the contact lenses in Georgia. We've gotten it from ophthalmologist, the medical association of Georgia plus input from I care professional organizations that provide telemedicine in 47 other states. These I care telemedicine providers actually use board certified Georgia licensed ophthalmologist to evaluate patients with what's called an I assessment to checking their vision and their I assessment by telemedicine with careful safety guardrails. This allows them to do that for up to 24 months of refills. Currently the current Georgia code calls for an in person exam every year by everyone who wears contacts. I will say the initial prescription for contacts still has to be done in person along with any follow-up visits. That's very important and very important that somebody haven't provided immediately available. It also puts guardrails around any telemedicine on people with higher risk conditions. In the bill we've described those as long as we stay between 21 and 50 where there's low risk of other I problems as long as there's no diabetes, hypertension or other high-risk conditions. It has felt and has been the input of all the professionals I've mentioned that this would be a safe expansion of telemedicine for I care in Georgia. I have appreciated the work of the I care professionals and the professional organizations outside this room. There's been great input. There's been great agreement and look forward to coming from this with better access, affordability and convenience for patients across Georgia. So I appreciate your favorable consideration, Madam Speaker. I'm glad to stand for any questions. You have a question. The chair recognizes Representative Ridley for a question. This is gentleman Eul. I know you said that this bill you've got to have your initial prescription. Is this just like if I'm renewing that same prescription? Correct. If you're in those age, you have none of the conditions mentioned in the bill that puts you at risk. If you're within the 21 to 50 age range, which is also a low risk, it's determined that as long as you've seen an I care professional in person in the last 24 months, you can get one or two refills. Okay. So there is a timeline on 24 months. Right. Yeah. Okay. There are no more questions. Appreciate your favorable consideration. Gentlemen, is Eul did the well? Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee has agreed to show this bill now pass. All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. For what purpose does Minority Leader Beverly rise? I pursuant to House Rule 133, I asked to be excused from this vote. The gentleman has that right and the journal will so reflect. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of the bill, the A's were 171, the NA's were zero.

The official go to Georgia, annotated relating the general provisions relative to registration, operation and sales of watercraft. So it's to provide for the carrying of night visual distress signals upon coastal waters of the state during certain hours. This bill then, it's signed on the committee on Game Fish and Parks. That committee recommends a dis bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative Rhodes to present the bill. Thank you, Madam Chair. I have before you, House Bill 207, this bill does two simple things. It's basically our dinner update. We're just updates and mistakes that were made in code from previous years. The first issue is our distress signals. We're just making it where it is for coastal waters, not all waters. Just coastal waters for the distress signals in this state. The second thing is, is for our voting operators currently in current code. If they have an accident, they can leave the scene and have 48 hours to report the accident. This legislation just simply says they have to stay on scene until authorities arrive. That's the bill, Madam Speaker. You have a question? Yes, ma'am, I'll take one. The chair recognizes representative Gallup for a question. Thank you, does the gentleman yield? Yes, sir. So a hit and run on a vehicle. Is that a felony today or is that a misdemeanor or do you know? I think you know that answer, don't you? Well, looking at the bill quickly, I don't know the answer. I think I have an idea, but I don't know the answer. I'm no attorney. I'm sure we have somebody who can answer that for us. OK, but this will be a felony on a voting. Yes, because you're dealing with water. And if you just completely ignore everything and leave, there are a lot more consequences on water than it is on land. Thank you. Yes, sir. I yield the way, Madam Speaker. There are no more questions. And the gentleman is yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the report to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none.

The bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill.\n\n167 House bill 167. House bill 167, Revive Reps of Monta-Hon of the 17th and others to be entitled and act to amend Code Section 4564. The Fish Quotid Georgia Annotated Relating and Limited Driving Permits for Certain Offenders. So to provide for standards for issuance of such permits, this bill I'm referring to committee on motor vehicles that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative Monta-Hon to present the bill. Thank you, Madam Speaker, members of the House. Today I present to you House bill 167. House bill 167 simply adds language to the code that allows a person that is in a Rears for child support to receive a limited driving permit, allowing them to continue to work and pay the errors for that child support. Now, I've note a judge would still have to approve the issuance of such permit and it is not in any way an automatic process. A permit issued under this legislation would be revoked if the individual is not catching up on the child support owed and let's be clear. This legislation does not reduce any penalties on those who do not support their children. It doesn't encourage folks not to pay their child support. It just simply allows a judge who knows the facts of a case to recognize when someone who is behind on their child support can or cannot drive to work. And so we're giving that discretion back to these judges. It's not going to make it easier for them to get current, but it allows them to again work to get current. If a judge were to have viewed or I'm sorry, if a judge issues this name to driving permit to someone who chooses to abuse that privilege, this legislation makes it clear that they shall lose that permit if they're not catching up. Today we have 119,000 hard suspensions that are not eligible for these folks to go back to work. And I think we're aiming at trying to get these folks back to work and supporting their children. Madam Speaker, and I'm sorry, DDS and DHS are both in support. The child service division are in support of the bill. And Madam Speaker, I would yield for any questions. Do you have questions? The chair recognizes Representative Holly for a question. Thank you, Madam Speaker. Does the gentleman you? I you. Is it not true that I along with probably many members in this house look forward to you actually speaking from the well just because we love the tone of your voice? Well, thank you. I am. Yeah, I appreciate that. Thank you very much. Just general for the you. Certainly. If you got any more compliments, I'll take as many as I can get. Is it not true that about a few years ago used to work at that courthouse building about a couple of blocks from here, writing up child support warrants and it troubled me that we could actually have opportunities for parents to make good on getting a job, actually making sure they could pay for their family, but we just needed them to be able to get there. And so I certainly am going to support this and I appreciate you bringing this bill. Well, thank you. And I thank that you know children and families have to come first. And that's the intention of the bill. Thank you. I would like to present it mentally for a question. Thank you Madam Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? I do. Is it not true that I will be voting in support of House bill 167 because I believe that not only will this bill help get fathers back to work, it certainly will help with the transportation deficiencies that we face in rural Georgia. Is that not true? That's great. And is it not further true representative that this bill will certainly help address the workforce shortage that we are facing in rural Georgia and also be able to ensure that families can remain strong with the fathers working and being able to help with their families incomes and issues? That's not true. That's absolutely true. It's putting folks back to work and putting food on the table. That's a famous and children come first. Right. Thank you for your work on this bill. Thank you very much. The chair recognizes for a last question representative Paris for a question. Thank you ladies here. This is gentleman yield. I yield. Thank you sir. So I'm certainly in favor of the bill. Would you tell me what is the process that the delinquent parent father would have to go through in order to get to having their license reinstated? That's right. So under the provisions of this bill a deliquant parent could petition a court or judge that would then issue an emitter driving permit and would be of course monitored by all the parties. You've got a lot of folks that are invested in this process from lawyers opposing counsel making sure that in holding accountable to these folks are going to go to work pay this child support this in the rear. And that's important part right. We want to get to work but what else I want to pay back that child support in getting them to pay back that child support and putting that food on the table is a number one concern. Chair representative thank you for your work on this. This will unlock just a part of father's rights and appreciate your work on this bill. Thank you very much. Well that man of speaker I yield the well. The gentleman is yielded the well. Is there any objection to a. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered the chair here is not in the previous questions ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute chair here is not in the committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill. The chair here is not in the report of the committee has agreed to shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted. If so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill the a's were 168 the nays were zero the bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will lead the caption to House bill 121 House bill 121 House bill 121 by the represent of Anderson to the 10th to be titled an act to amend Article 1 of chapter 7 of Title 52 of the fiscal to Georgia and it's had a relating the registration operation in sales of water craft. Generally so is the provide for restrictions requirements regarding awake surfing and wakeboarding. This bill I refer to the committee on game fishing park second committee recommends that this bill do pass chair recognizes representative Anderson to present the bill. Thank you Madam Chair colleagues I bring before you today House bill 121 this have this bill is designed to protect personal property and also personal safety on Georgia's lakes and waterways. Currently the state has a regulation that says within 100 feet of the shoreline or stationary structures docs etc. In all lakes public lakes in the state of Georgia motorized water craft can operate above an idle speed not generate we can refer that as a no-week zone. A contemporary issue has come up within the last several years with a popularity of a sport called began as wakeboarding now it is wake surfing. This is where a boat that has specially designed ballast or a boat that has been retrofitted with ballast to be filled with water sit very deep in the water at a slow speed and generate a wake that is 3 to 4 feet high that can literally be surfed on with a surfboard. What this bill does is this for only that activity when that size of a wake is being generated that has the capability of being surfed this bill limits that activity to outside of a buffers on of 200 feet. It does not affect water skiing is defined in here that it is only pro activities that is related to boarding. It does not affect private lakes it does however protect the shoreline the personal safety the water craft of those in our lakes and waterways who own property and enjoy the activities along those areas. Madam Speaker that is the bill I will take any questions if there are. Gentlemen has a question the chair recognizes representative Ridley for a question. Gentlemen you yes sir you said that these wake boats when you put water in and they go down lower in the water to make bigger waves correct. Yes sir and that is the only boats that will be affected by this bill. This bill does not actually direct its enforcement towards a boat or a specific type of boat directs it to the activity of generating a wake of that size. So it could be a boat that is defined as a manufactured wake boat it could also be a boat that has been retrofitted to serve that same purpose. Gentlemen further you yes sir let me give you a hypothetical situation if I've got a regular boat and I put four liter McDonald in the back and it lowers it down in the water more. Am I breaking the law at that point if that causes a wake large enough for yourself or someone to surf on then yes sir. If you're if you're within 200 feet of the shore so the answer is yes four liter. Thank you. Thank you. Chair recognizes representative Dickie to your right for a question. Does the gentleman yield? Yes sir. Going from 100 to 200 is pretty big jump. How will operators be able to determine where 200 feet is and the size of the wake and some of those types of objective issues that they are might bring forward to operator. Thank you for the question that's a really good question. This bill was actually crafted with the cooperation of Colonel Bernard from DNR. His answer to that question is there when they promulgate the rules to enforce this they'll part of that process is an education process to make sure the signage is posted and that their rangers and the law enforcement agency of DNR understand and work with the public and the voting public to not necessarily use a hammer on this but to do that. Use a hammer on this but to make use of the educational process. Does the gentleman further yield? Yes sir. What do you feel like DNR is doing a good job and I enforce it in 100 feet. I know I know landowners and property owners complained about when they get close but do you think the hundred foot is being been used now in a proper way. Again another very good question and my answer would be this within the resources that DNR has I think that they're doing a good job of addressing the complaints that they get. Our DNR law enforcement agency is approximately 40% under staff at the time. A lot of that's due to a lot of reasons we've had a lot of discussion related to that from a budget standpoint and from a DNR standpoint that's something that we will need to address and we do need to address not just within that. I think it's not quite an arm of law enforcement but across the board. But to answer your question when they are contacted they're having to address those issues and they're trying to do the educational process as much as I can in between. Thank you. Chair recognizes representative Meeks for a question. Thank you Madam Speaker. Is the gentleman you own? Yes sir. Just wanted to ask does this pertain to inter-custom waterways as well? Does any publicly accessible waterway in the state of Georgia that DNR has the enforcement jurisdiction on? Thank you sir. Chair recognizes representative Mom to him for a question. Like you Madam Speaker this is gentleman you. Yes sir. I hate to follow up Representative Redley's question within the high pivotent but when I jump off the back of the boat it makes quite a wake. Now if these are totally man-made or organic or naturally made wakes is that included in the bill? Well in the case of the gentleman with the healthier diet that he is exercising that wake is nowhere near as much as it used to be. So no sir I don't think they would apply. Well you got a yes vote on that. The chair recognizes for a final question representative McDonald to your right. Thank you Madam Speaker. Is gentleman you? Yes sir. Isn't it true that a lot of the issues came from the late communities there being proactive and they are going to be producing maps at the passivist bill that they are going to distribute, educate their people not only with signage but map drawings to show where 200 foot buffers will be and 100 foot buffers just for educational purposes or all their lakes. That is correct. The lake associations that we have worked with in the crafting of this bill have been very proactive in their plans to provide education and to provide notices on their properties and the lakes that they work with. I will as a final note Madam Speaker if I may. This bill as it is presented has the full support of the national motor boat manufacturers association as well as the water sports industry association. So both the boat manufacturers and the water sports associations are in support of this bill as it stands. And with that I will ask for your favorable consideration. Madam Chair I will yield the well. The chair recognizes chairman Powell to speak to the bill. Madam Speaker and ladies and gentlemen the House. I want to come to you today in full support with my thanks to my friend represented from the 10th district. This is a bill that has been trying to get something done with a few years. But because of the nature of this is a recreational event. A lot of people don't understand the seriousness these week boat the week boats have created as far as danger not only to the other boaters but do not yet but to the to the lock to the docks and to the other boats that around. Now something about water at alcohol we always said they don't mix. Well this is water and entertainment and fun for people's families they buy these boats and I understand some of these are in excess of $150,000 for these specialty boats that make these huge weeks. Well right now the Georgia law is a hundred foot weight group. I think the question was asked about DNR and I will tell you that DNR does a great job. But they don't have enough manpower for the lakes and for the lakes in the recreation areas that we have in the state. I can tell you as a member of this house that lives on probably one of the bigger lakes in the state of Georgia. Lake Harle that transcends and joins both Georgia and South Carolina and it's a big lake. But even with that lake people come down they bring their weight boats down but there's a failure there's a disconnect in common sense. Instead of getting out into the middle of the lake where they can use these boats and the wakers subside by the time it gets to the docks or the other boats they don't do it. Somehow they always want to get right up close. Now they may stay a hundred foot out but a hundred foot quite frankly is not enough room to dispel a four or five foot wake. When I talk about the damage it's done floating docks it can literally throw you or your children or your grandchildren off of these docks. It breaks the cables on these docks. It will pick a boot up and sit it on the side of a dock when these wakes hit. So this is a good first attempt. Representative Anderson saw the need in this. He took it forward it didn't go as far as some of us would like for it to have gone. But I think it's a good first step. It defines that there's a four hundred foot barrier from bank to bank that these can be used in its two hundred feet. I opted for three hundred foot didn't go but I adhere to the committee action on that. It may come back at some point but right now the message should be give the Rangers a little bit more latitude so they can enforce something that common sense should have told me they should tell these people. Don't destroy somebody else's property with your fun and entertainment. That ladies and gentlemen is what the bill does. I would certainly commend this to you for your vote and do something for the vote and for the property owners and the folks who enjoy the lakes in this state. That's been all out of you the well. The gentleman has yielded the well is there any objection to the previous question being ordered the chair here is not the previous questions ordered is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill the chair here is not the report of the committee is agreed to. I'll just bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes all those opposed will vote no in the clerk will unlock the machine. All members voted. If so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill the yays were 164 the nays were zero the bill having received the requisite constitution majority is therefore pass. The chair postpones to the next legislative day House bill 226 House bill 226. We're moving on to afternoon orders the chair recognizes representative Nguisi. We'll from Reverend Dr. Durley. He's actually last of the iconic civil rights leader. So I'll tell you about him if you didn't know. I stand before you my assembly colleagues to recognize the world-renowned Reverend Jett Gerald Durley, a man of God whose life stretched across the struggle for racial equality against the Jack Jim Crow in the South. He was a wait, I'm sorry. He educated African Americans as to their family heritage to a long academic college career at Atlanta's own Clark University as well as none other than Morehouse College. To his current role as pastor and mentor as at Providence Missionary about this church, this man of God is the Paragon of Commitment to his community. When John F. Kennedy was assassinated Reverend Dr. Durley turns tragedy into triumph as he honored the late president with service in Nigeria with the Peace Corps. With deep knowledge acquired from years of study into psychology, his renowned faith by meddling civil and human rights under the banner of God's Kingdom and when he found another opportunity to help overlook and under serve communities, he left into action. By joining with George's ONTED Turner and Northern actress Jane Fonda, two prominent environmentalists as well as countless other leaders in the conservation movement, Reverend Dr. Durley incorporated the preservation of our scarce planet, especially when the abuses of our Earth fall, disproportionately upon those without means and pursued knowledge of activism once more in the name of the deeply rooted beliefs. While he is a proud Christian, Reverend Dr. Durley is a man of faith of all Christians, Muslims, Jews, Buddhist Hindus, he would tell you just like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said, none of us are free until we are all free. And I don't know if he's still in the galley, but he might not be. But thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Chair recognizes Representative Carpenter for an afternoon order. All right, folks. I know it's getting late.
