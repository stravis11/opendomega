It's a pleasure to once again welcome back\nPastor Benny Tate.\nMany of you in this chamber have been here and heard him and met him\nand been blessed by what he's had to say.\nPastor Bitty has been at Rock Springs Church for 36 years now.\nAnd he does a lot of things.\nHe's an author. He has a new book that's on your desk.\nI got a copy for everybody, so I hope that you found it on your desk this morning.\nI hope you'll take some time to read that.\nI think it's a wonderful book and I think you'll be blessed by it\nand I hope you enjoy that.\nThe Pastor Benny does that.\nWe have multiple campuses, several missions.\nHe's the founder and chancellor of Rock Springs Christian Academy,\nwhere my kids get to go to school,\nand I'm honored to get to serve on the school board there.\nWe have a group of our kids here today.\nWe have all of the eighth grade,\nand a lot of the seventh graders here,\nincluding my son, Jason, sitting up in the gallery,\nso we want to make them welcome.\nI'm glad to have them here.\nPastor Benny has also been the president of our church\ndenomination. He's done a lot of things.\nBut I want to tell you what I tell people when they ask me\nabout Benny Tape.\nAny time asked somebody asked me about him,\nI tell him a story.\nAs many of you know, five years ago,\nas we ended session, 2021, right at the end of session,\nmy dad was sick, we brought him home from the hospital,\nand we knew we had a short time with him.\nWe got to talking one day, specifically\nhe and my wife, who is a much better Christian\nthan I am than Pastor Benny can attest to that.\nBut my wife got to talking to my mom and my dad about their salvation and\nwanted to make sure they were prepared.\nAnd they said that they weren't sure.\nThey weren't convinced.\nSo my wife, being who she is, got on her phone called Pastor Benion, his cell phone\nand said, would he come and talk to them?\nThat evening, he and his wife, Ms. Barbara, drove from their house in Versailles,\nGeorgia to the north end of Butts County to my mom and dad's house,\nbrought some banana bread that Barbara had made. I may have eaten the banana bread. I shared it with\nthem, but he came up there, sat with my parents for nearly an hour and prayed with both of them to get saved.\nNow, I don't care what else anybody ever does for me. There will be nothing that will mean more\nthan that for me and what he did for me and my family. So when people ask me about him,\nThat's who he is. He is a pastor. He is reaching people for Jesus. That is his mission. That's what he\ndoes. And I am honored to have him be my pastor. And I'm even more honored to have him be my friend.\nPlease welcome back, Dr. Benny Tate.\nWell, good morning and thank you so much for being here. Thank you for the client,\nfor those kind words. As he was introducing me, I was praying. I was praying for a\nclient, and I was actually asking the Lord to forgive him. I said, God, forgive brother\nclient for overpraising me. And then I prayed to prayer and I said, God, forgive me for enjoying\nit so much. Amen. A good good morning. Good to see all of you. Just I honored to have the\nstudents just have a curiosity. How many would say Pastor Benny? I've never heard you before.\nI've never heard you before. Could you raise your hand? I've never heard you before. Just a few of\nyou. Just a few. Well, I'll say to you few, what a list of Taylor said to her eighth husband.\nI'm not going to keep you long. Amen. Not going to keep you long. I want to talk to you this morning\nin a scripture that's found in 2 Timothy, chapter 1, verse 16. This is what the scripture\nsays. The Lord give mercy unto the house of own Cypheras, for he often refresh me and\nwas not ashamed of my chains. He often refresh me and was not ashamed of my chains. I want\ntalk to you this morning about what every person needs, what every person needs. I\nremember a few years back, a few years back, I was with Mr. Truitt Cathy. And Mr.\nTruitt Cathy said to me, he said, Pastor Benny, do you know how you can\ndetermine whether or not a person needs encouragement? I said, no, no, Mr.\nHow do I know if a person needs encouragement?\nHe said, Benny, if they're breathing, they need encouragement.\nIf they're breathing, they need encouragement.\nDuring this time, we've got a lot of people running for office.\nI heard about a guy the other day that was running for office\nand he was making a speech.\nAnd while he was speaking, a heckler stood up and the heckler said,\nI wouldn't vote for you if you was Saint Peter.\nAnd the politician spoke back and said,\nif I was Saint Peter, you wouldn't be in my district.\nAmen?\nEverybody needs encouragement.\nI heard about him, Mrs. Johnson.\nShe was a teacher, Mrs. Johnson.\nAnd she had Johnny in her class.\nAnd Johnny would literally make these ugly faces.\nAnd Mrs. Johnson said, Johnny, when I was a little girl, the teacher told me that if you\nmake ugly faces, your face will literally freeze that way.\nHe said, Mrs. Johnson, you can't say you wasn't warned.\nAmen.\nWell, here's what I know about every person.\nThis is what I know about every 80 members of this body, 180 members of this body, every\none of you need encouragement.\nAnd if you don't own day three, you will, by day 40, every one of you need encouragement.\nAnd what's so encouraging to me is every one of us can do it.\nEvery one of us can encourage other people.\nYour surpasser helped me out, I will.\nHow can I encourage somebody today?\nFirst of all, you can encourage people with your praise.\nWith your praise, Proverbs 18 and 21 says,\ndeath and life is in the power of the tongue.\nFolks, this world that we get to live in,\nI believe, was spoken into existence.\nSpoken words created this world.\nThat's what I believe.\nhope you do too. I don't want to be like the guy that said once I was a tadpole\nbeginning to begin and then it was a frog with my tail tucked in and then I\nwas a monkey in a banana tree and now I'm a professor with a PhD. I don't believe\nthat. I believe that God spoke this world into existence. Friend listen to me\nclosely. If words created this world, your words can create somebody else's\nworld because death and life's in the power of the tongue. How can we encourage\npeople? We can encourage people with our praise. Let me tell you a second way\nwe can encourage people. We can encourage people with our presence. Notice what\nit said, the Lord gave mercy into the house of Ohm Cypherus for he often\nrefresh me and was not ashamed of my chains. Proverbs 17 and 17 says a friend\nlove it at all times and a brother is born for adversity. Said Pastor Benny I\nwant to I won't encourage somebody I'll tell you how you can do it. I'll tell\nyou how you can do it. You can encourage somebody with your presence just be\nthere for that person. We encourage people, we encourage people with our praise, we encourage\npeople with our presence, but I'll tell you a third way. I've been the pastor and he said 36\nyears at Rock Springs Church. How do you stay at a church 36 years? Well, when you want to leave,\nyou just stay. And when the people want you to leave, you just stay. I just figured it would be\neasier for them to move their membership than me to move my furniture.\nAmen? I just stay.\nI'm speaking a few weeks ago on a lady walked out the door and she said that was a warm message.\nI thought what does that mean? Don't do that today.\nThe following week I'm standing at the door, she came out the door and she said that was a warm\nmessage. I said, wonder what that means. The third week she came out the door, Mrs. Speaker,\nand she said, that's a warm message. I said, ma'am, what does that mean? She said, not so hot.\nWe encourage people with our praise. We encourage people with our presence, but let me tell you\nthird way you can encourage people. You encourage people with your pen. I know we're in the electronic\nage. Sometimes it don't work elsewhere, am I man? I do believe when the devil's not bothering us,\nI believe is in sound equipment. But we're in the electronic age and everything's digital today,\nbut folks let me tell you something. Politicians listen to me closely. There's power in picking up\nyour pen and writing somebody a handwritten note. I don't save a lot of stuff, but I save\nhandwritten notes that have been written to me. Look here. I'm almost finished. If you get finished\nbefore I do, just slip out. I'm almost finished. But we encourage people with our praise. We encourage\npeople with our presence. We encourage people with our pain, but there's one other way we can\nencourage people. We can encourage people with our prayers. You say, well, I'm praying for people.\nYeah, but here's the thought. Let them know you're praying for them. Because if you live long enough,\nif you live long enough, you'll get to the point sometimes it's hard to pray for yourself.\nWhen you've got somebody who comes alongside of you and says I just want you to know I'm\npraying for you.\nOne of my heroes in the political arena and first of all I want to say thank God for every\none of you.\nI came today to encourage you.\nI want to say thank God for every one of you.\nYou say I'm a Republican, I'm a Democrat.\nfolks, we're Americans. We're Georgians. That matters not. But I want to come and say thank you\nfor what you do. But I'll tell you who I really wish I could speak to. I wish I could speak to your\nmates and your children. Because I'd like to say to your mates and children, thank you for the\nsacrifice. Thank you for the sacrifice you give, for your\nmate, your husband, your wife, your mom, your dad, to do this\nservice to our great state. Abraham Lincoln was was\nkilled tragically. And when Abraham Lincoln was killed\ncongregation, they started looking at what he had on him when\nwas killed. He had a pair of glasses, he had a pocket knife, he had a handkerchief, he\nhad a $5, $5 Confederate $5 bill. Then they noticed something else. He had a couple\nnewspaper articles. And then these newspaper articles were tattered. But in these articles\nthe writer had spoke complimentary of President Lincoln and so from time to time he'd get\nhim out and he would read them because Mr. Truett was right. Everybody including you needs\nencouragement and everybody around you needs encouragement because listen, I'm done.\nIf you treat everybody, if you treat everybody, that means you, that means you, that means\nyou.\nIf you treat everybody, if you treat everybody, you'll be treating 90% of the people correctly.\nLet's pray.\nwe bow our heads and hearts in your presence. I spoke of Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln said\nthose words, I've been driven to my knees by an overwhelming conviction that I had nowhere else\nto go. My wisdom and all about me seemed insufficient in the day. I pray your wisdom upon this delegation.\nI pray your wisdom upon this house. I pray God that every member of this house, Lord,\nthat you would give them your goddess, that they would be led by you. Not only do I pray for them,\nbut I pray for their families. Keep them safe. Protect them, Lord. Meet the needs of their families.\nI pray for traveling mercy. Many travel from North Georgia, South Georgia to be here and serve.\nThe coast to be here, serve this body. I pray that you will keep them safe on the roads.\nGod, I just ask you to bless them and keep them, make your face to shine up on them, be gracious\nand to them, lift your countenance upon them, and may they experience your peace for I pray\nthis prayer, respecting all faiths, but I pray this prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nThank you brother Benny door keepers you may unlock the doors brother Benny thank you for being here and providing those words of encouragement\nYou\nYou\nmembers, well, members, you may agree, brother Bini in the south any room if you'd like\nto speak to him and give telling him thanks for being here with us today.\nYou\nYou\nWell, good morning again, we want to thank Representative Sheila Jones of the 60th House\nDistrict for bringing Dr. Organ to us as our doctor of the day, Dr. Graffin Reed Organ.\nThank you.\nShe's been here before.\nWe appreciate her service.\nChairman Hilton the chair of the video and information on it says recognize good\nToo much\nThey fix that's godly\nYeah, thank you miss speaker your committee on information on it says rev the journal the previous legislative day and found it to be correct\nChairman Hilton, the chair of the Committee on Information and\nAudits reports, and a very powerful voice, that the journal of the previous legislative\nday has been read and found to be correct.\nIs there any objection to dispense with the reading of the journal?\nHearing none, the reading of the journal is dispensed with.\nIs there any objection to the confirmation of the journal?\nvery none.

When the power is exercised without restraint, liberty\nitself is at risk. Now let us say it plainly. As someone raised to respect the law, order\nand the rule that stands for all of us and that no one stands above it, America is the\nstrongest, the authority is disciplined and accounted for. The government that acts\nfor our very trust is niece earned every day.\nBad actions by anyone wearing a badge\nor holding the title is dishonor\nand dishonor to the good men and women\nthat serve our nation faithfully daily.\nWe can believe in both borders\nand still in human dignity.\nWe can stand for enforcement\nand still stand against injustice.\nWe can put America first.\nWe can put America first\nwithout putting compassion down.\nRen\u00e9e Nicole Good should still be alive today.\nHer children should still hear her voice.\nIt is the republic that must endure.\nIt is our democracy that must endure.\nAnd with her death, it must not be ignored, excused, or buried.\nAs a great Georgian once said and taught us, the arc of the moral universe bends towards\njustice, but only with patriots that are brave enough to bend with it.\nLet us honor, let us honor Ren\u00e9e Nicole Goodman, not with empty words, but with truth, accountability,\nand renewed commitment to our nation\nto protect life, liberty, and justice for all.\nBecause that is what America means to put America first.\nThank you, colleagues.\nGeorgia first.\nThank you, Representative.\nThank you Mr. Speaker ladies and gentlemen I'll be brief I know that this session has gotten\noff to a quick start this year it feels.\nMember of law enforcement myself is an assistant district attorney knowing the judicial process\nlike I do.\nI just feel compelled to come here to this well to say that the rule of law is what rules\nin this country that there's an opportunity for review.\nAny time that national politics are going to influence the debates and discussions that\nwe have here at the state capital, potentially we may be doing so with more of a political\nslant than policy-driven approach.\nAnd what I would just say is this, we back the blue here in Georgia, the caucus that\nI lead has been very clear about that, that we have no intent of doing anything differently\nand it's proud as a proud member of the caucus that I serve as majority leader for, intend\nto do so here in the future.\nThere's an opportunity for discussions and investigations to take place, but at the end\nof the day we cannot allow the rule of law to be criticized or influenced in such a way\nthat it gets us off track from focusing on the needs of Georgians here in our state.\nWith that in the speaker, I yield the well.\nThank you, Representative.\nThat concludes our afternoon orders.\nWe'll move on to announcements.\nsince you've Chaz Cannon.\nRepresentative Chaz Cannon is recognized for an announcement.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nYou got an invite on your desk yesterday, an email from me\nyesterday about keeping Georgia wild tomorrow.\nIt's in the South atrium steps from 8 to 11.\nThe governor will speak around 9 o'clock,\nspeaker will speak about the same time.\nLieutenant Governor Jones and among others,\nCommissioner Ray Buns, invite you to come\nto keeping Georgia wild day tomorrow, eight to 11\nin the South atrium steps.\nHope to see you there.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nNot about wildlife, that's what I thought.\nAnd the coast, absolutely.\nGood spot.\nNeed any frustration you have an announcement?\nNot that announcement, but an announcement.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nLadies and gentlemen of the House,\nthere is a committee chairman's lunch today\nupon a German in room 403 of the state capital.\nUpon a German room 403 of the state capital.\nThank you.\nThank you, Chair Lady Lynn Smith has recognized\nfor an announcement.\nWell, good afternoon colleagues.\nTomorrow morning, the House Natural Resource\nand Environment Committee will have a hearing\non House Resolution 108.\nIt is a hearing only and also an emphasis\non a little bit of education.\nIt's been a long time since we've addressed issues\nsuch as this.\nSo it's a full committee meeting tomorrow at 8 o'clock\nin room 606, CLAB.\nThank you.\nThank you, Chair Lady.\nThat completes our announcements.\nComplete our announcements.\nThank you members for your attention today.\nHope you have an opportunity to visit\nwith some home folks if they're up here.\nSo with that, I'm going to recognize the majority leader for a motion.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nI move that this House stand adjourned until Thursday, January 15th, 2026 at 10 o'clock a.m.\nTimes flying on the motion of the majority leader.\nThis House stands adjourn until 10 a.m. Thursday, January the 15th, 2026.\nAll those in favor will say aye.\nAll those opposed, no.\nYou guys with no's are getting closer.\nThe a's clearly have it.\nSo it sounds up here.\nThis house is adjourned.\nThank you, members.\n",
