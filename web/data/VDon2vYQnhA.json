  "transcript": "in local governmental operations, which is favorable to the passage of the bills on the local consent calendar.\nChair here is none, and the board of the committee has agreed to.\nQuestions on the passes of the bills on the local consent calendar, all those in favor?\nWe'll vote yay, oppose nay, secretary, one lot in the machine.\nYou\nAll in the past so the bill yeas are 55 and the nays are one the bill on the local\npercent calendar having receded registered constitutional majority is therefore half.\nMoving on, House bill 14, Mr. Secretary.\nHouse bill 14 by representative Carpenter of the fourth and others,\nit builds me down on act to amend Article 3, Chapter 3 of Title 50.\nThe official go to Georgia and take away to other state symbols.\nSo as to designated Cormbread as the official state of Georgia,\nto write legislative findings and declarations to our related matters to\nbe a long-completing laws and for other purposes.\nMr. President, the Senate command rules were recommended this bill due passed by\nSubstitute Respect Police Minutes in a brass chairman.\nMr. President, the Senate command rules are following a substitute to House Bill 14\nto build between Title IX and Title V, the Vistula of Georgia annotated.\nWhat do you state government as to as to enact the Georgia music office and\nmusic writing communities act and for other purposes?\nMr. President, that completes the order.\nWe're going to have the center from the fourth, 46, I'm sorry.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nWell, we've had a little bit of a contentious afternoon on some of these bills.\nAnd I want everybody to know I still love you.\nlove you whether you've voted with me or against me and this is one of those types of bills\nthat we all come back to get you know it's been said by many that music is the universal\nguess language of love and I will tell you right now I have zero musical ability can't carry a\ntune can't play any kind of instrument in the world but there ain't anybody in this room\nthat loves music more than I do especially live music grew up in making Georgia\nwhich is sort of the epicenter of much of the great R&B music in this\nstate as well as the birthplace of Southern Rock and Roll. We have many\nfantastic musicians that come from the state of Georgia let me run through a few\nI'll start in my hometown of Macon, where Little Richard first burst on the scene.\nAnd Otis Redding, he was from just outside of Macon.\nThe first deer I ever killed was on the Redding Ranch out in Jones County, Georgia of their\nstate.\nOf course, we've had the almond brothers and all the great acts of Capricorn music in\nJason Aldin these days with country music all coming out of making and after I got out\nof law school I settled in Athens, Georgia and goodness it was right at the epicenter of\nthe explosion of new music coming out of Athens where we had the B-52s and REM and widespread\npanic and many others from there.\nWe've got James Brown from Augusta, Georgia, the Godfather of Seoul, Ma Rainey from Columbus,\nsort of the grandmother of the Blues.\nWe've got Christian Rock bands, third day and casting crowns, excuse me, from here in\nthe Atlanta area.\nalso has tremendous hip-hop and R&B music with usher, outcast, ludicrous, TLC,\nsilo green, all hailing from here, and recording here. Other great country acts in\nGeorgia, Alan Jackson, down in Noon in Georgia, Sugarland. We've got Luke\nBrian Trissier-Yearwood out of Monticello, Travis Tritt, I could go on and on.\nNow let me tell you something, I'll get all those names that I just told you.\nI forgot the senator from the 26th.\nMaybe he may not be as famous or made as much money at it, but he's recorded as a music festival every spring I'm invited to.\nSo let y'all in on a little secret about how weird I am, how eclectic I am, in high school,\ngrew up in Macon.\nI went to the Macon Mall every weekend to Camelot Music, and the manager of fellow\nname Lee, African American guy, and our good buddies, and he introduced me to so much music.\ny'all will laugh at this.\nI would buy an eight track tape almost every weekend in high school.\nI was working at the YMCA and I'd save up my money to\nput some gas in my old ragged out Mustang too.\nAnd I'd get a new tape of some sort eventually\ngrowing to cassette tapes and maybe having enough money\nfor the date on the weekend.\nBut I was exposed to all kind of music and I loved it all.\nEvery single musician I just named except for Maureenie\nare now on Spotify playlist of mine.\nAm I crazy or what?\nThat's a wide range of musical taste.\nAnd one of my favorite days in here last year to ago\nwas when George Clinton, from Parliament and Funkadelic,\nSenator 26th, you talk about Superfly.\nHe was dressed like Superfly when he came in\nand I got my picture babe with him\nbecause I remembered.\nAnd high school going to make in Coliseum\nand seeing Parliament, Funkadelic,\nconcert there where that spaceship came down on the stage\nthey let them out of there. So I like it all. I like it all. And it is a true asset of this state.\nWe've got music studios all over. Athens has them. Recording studios,\nMacon has the old Capricorn studios is back recording these days. And it's open for the public.\nWe are spending all kind of money, tax benefits to promote the movie industry here in our state, and we are spending zero for the music industry.\nIt's all about the movies.\nWe've got our own home grown artist.\nI just want us to have a chance to promote them.\nAnd that is all we're doing with this bill, which is House Bill 14.\nrepresented. Carpenter got it started over there and\nsent it to us. We perfected it. It made it a little bit better.\nBut it just creates the Georgia Music Office\nand Music Ready Communities Act.\nIt is no appropriation unless we decide to do it\nand we think it will take extremely little money.\nIf we want to market our musicians,\npromote our concerts, advertise, do public relations,\ncommunity relations to try to build these music industries in our state. We've\ngot it going on. We've got all the artists that you could ask for here but we\nneed to grow our music industry just like we do others and this is the cheapest\nway I can think of just to set up a department and this may be just one or two\npeople for all we know under the Department of Economic Development let's get\ngoing and trying to promote our musicians. Now we were sitting here fighting\nearlier but this is a joint enterprise a bipartisan bill senator from the\n39th asked me to help her with it and I said I'm all in this is not a\nDemocratic bill it is not a Republican bill this it in any kind of racial\nbill at all it's got them all anybody that can promote music in the state of\nGeorgia, I'm behind them and I think it's an asset, a real talent base here, and would\nask you to please help me and let's get something going where we can have grants and promotions\nand music and festivals, even the Senator from the 26th Festival down in making, we'll\ntry to promote that and get him some customers there.\nMr. President, I'm happy to yield the will or I'll take any questions that the crowd has\neven about my musical taste.\nYou do have a question from probably the biggest music lover in here and the senator from eight\nLittle Elvis, thank you, Mr. President. The senator you I will be happy to\nSenator, I just want to make sure that you're really up on your music knowledge\nCan you tell the members of this body, sir? Don't make me sing. Well, I just want to ask this\nI wonder if you could prove your knowledge by telling the members of this body who the greatest solo recording artists have all\nAll time was what I called him the king for a reason Elvis Presley Elvis airing for us. Thank you, Senator\nI was born in Mississippi, so I got a connection to him as well\nThank you, Mr. President. I yield the will\nSenator's yielding\nVery nice and from 39\nI want to thank my friend from District 46 who has already laid out the reasons to vote\nyes on this bill.\nAnd I won't belabor the issue, but I do want to underscore just a few points.\nAs you well know, Georgia is a state that believes in economic development.\nWe focus on industries that create jobs, attract businesses, and drive growth.\nAnd today, right now, we have the opportunity to do the same for one of our most powerful,\nbut often overlooked economic engines, music.\nGeorge's music industry is a $5 billion powerhouse supporting over 70,000 jobs across the\nstate. It fuels tourism, hospitality,\ndigital media, and small businesses. Our music\nlegacy, which spans hip hop, country, gospel, and rock,\nhas made Georgia a global cultural force, but culture alone\ndoesn't create jobs. Focus does and strategy does. This bill\nbuilds on our economic momentum, ensuring that music has the\nstructure and the coordination to grow. We've seen what happens when Georgia\nprioritizes industries like manufacturing, technology and logistics. Music\ndeserves the same deliberate approach. Other states, Tennessee, Texas, Oklahoma,\nLouisiana, and just last year North Carolina had put targeted resources behind\ntheir music industries and the result speak for themselves. Stronger small businesses, more\nmusic tourism and better job pipelines for young people entering the industry. We have an existing\nmusic ecosystem. We aren't starting from scratch. We've already got the foundation to be a natural\nnational leader, over 70 world class recording studios, music festivals like Savannah music festival,\nmusic midtown and shaky knees bring millions in tourism dollars, cities like Macon, Athens,\nand Savannah are already recognized as global music destinations. We have a workforce beyond the\nstage, venue operators, sound engineers, event staff, music marketers, and small business owners,\nall depend on a thriving music economy.\nSo understanding our existing assets, infrastructure,\nand industry ecosystem is key to maximizing\nthis full economic potential.\nStatewide Music Office is a win for local businesses.\nIt's a win for Georgia's workforce.\nAnd it's a win for our state's economic development\nbecause music is economic development.\nAt its heart, this bill is about jobs, business growth,\nand keeping Georgia competitive.\nLet's make sure we support this industry\nthat helps make Georgia thrive.\nI urge your support for HB 14.\nThank you, unless there are questions,\nI yield the well.\nNo question, Senator, and we appreciate all your hard work\non this subject matter.\nDoes any other Senator wish to speak for against measure?\nChair, here's none.\nIs there objection to the previous question being ordered?\nChair utilizar \ufffdann Marie's question is ordered.\nQuestion is on the adoption of the Committee substitute.\nIs there objection to the adoption of the Committee substitute?\nHearing none of the Committee substitute is adopted.\nIs there objection to agreeing to the report and community which is favorable to the\npasses of the bill?\nChair here is none of the board committee is agreed to.\nIs there objection to the main question being ordered?\nChair here is none.\nthe main question has ordered.\nQuestions on the passes of the bill?\nAll those in favor vote yay all opposed may secretary on not machine\nYou\nAll in the passes of the bill, the A's of 47, I'm still trying to look at who these\nnine are. This bill has received\nreexec constitutional majority is\ntherefore passed by substitute.\nMust have been the cornbread in\nthere.\nSecretary Reed House bill 233.\nHouse bill 233.\nRepresentative Townsend of 179.\nI've been eligible to be in town and act to amend Article 3, Chapter 3, Title 50, the official code of Georgia annotated.\nRelated to other state symbols, those to designate Brunswick suit as the official state suits,\narrived for religious adverting, arrived for related matters to repealable looking laws and rather purposes.\nMr. President, the Senate Commandant of Wolves recommends that this bill do pass by sub-suicide submitted, Senator Brash, Chairman.\nMr. President, the Senate Commandant of Wolves offers the long sub-suicide to House Bill 233,\nbilled to be in town and act to amend Chapter 4, Title 1, and Title 50, the official code of Georgia annotated.\nto hold these own services and state government respectively.\nSo it's designated the 4th Friday in November of each year\nas National Sheriff Gaines here,\nbut they enjoyed it.\nIt's named Bredzo Xues, the official state stew.\nIt's designated as the Quornbred,\nas the official state red,\nto radical legislative findings,\nto prohibit and further purposes, Mr. President,\nthat completes the order.\nthat\nis\nMr. President, Mr. President, we are going to continue talking about some red-hot legislation\nmost important that we're going to do this year.\nI bring you Senate.\nWe're going to go by the way.\ngoing to go from Spotify to the kitchen table with Senate Bill 233, which is an amalgamation\nof several other very important bills. Section one of this bill makes the fourth Friday\nin November sugar cane syrup day in Georgia, and I can assure you I have had nothing on\nmy pancakes, but cane syrup since I was a little kid and won't have anything else.\nto makes Brunswick stew, the official stew of Georgia. Brunswick stew certainly has historical\nand economic significance, particularly to my hometown. It was born and raised in Brunswick\nGeorgia and there is absolutely no doubt, no debate whatsoever that Brunswick Georgia\nis the origination point of Brunswick stew. And then finally, section three, not finally,\nSection 3 designates cornbread as the official bread of Georgia, and I will tell you that\nI like mine with sour cream and with kernel corn and with cream corn in it, best in the\nworld.\nAnd then we added insignificantly section 4, which speaks to a foreign country of concern\nwill be ineligible to directly contract\nwith the state agency for good of services,\nincluding but not limited to a contract for the procurement\nor purchase of computers, printers, connecting tables,\nor interoperable video conference and services\nused in connection with an office environment\nin a country of concern is defined a country of concern\nor scrutinized country means any company,\nowned or operated by a foreign country\nof concern or country in which the government\nof a foreign country of concern has an ownership state.\nLittle background here in 2022,\nGovernor Kemp signed legislation that we pass\nprohibiting Chinese owned or operated companies\nfrom bidding on state contracts.\nThis language in section 4.1 is a tweet\nin House Bill 113, which passed the Senate last week\nunanimously.\nSection 4.1 of House Bill 233 specifies certain technology\nproducts such as computers, printers, and video\ncomparison equipment, and closes a loophole\nthat would allow these companies to bid on state contracts\nthrough third-party vendors.\nWe obviously have concerns about Chinese computers,\nwhich include the possibility of espionage,\ncyber attacks, and unfair trade practices.\nAnd according to the China tech threat folks,\nthe state of Georgia has spent 47,259,946 dollars\nbetween 2020 and 2022 on several Chinese back companies\nback companies, and this bill would pro-scribe that.\nFinally, let me tell you that what we're going to do here is we're going to sit down to\nour table, to a dinner table, a brunswick stew, cornbread, cane syrup.\nAnd unlike our lunch today, there will be no Chinese food.\na large favorable consideration will answer any questions if there are any.\nSenator from the 50th.\nI have a quick question about Cain's syrup.\nIs it not true that Waffle House doesn't serve Cain syrup?\nWhat?\nWaffle House does not serve Cain syrup.\nThat's why I don't buy Waffles at Waffle House.\nWell that was going to be my next question with the popularity of Waffle House this year.\nDid you consider speaking to the Waffle House lobbyist before introducing this bill?\nI will be more than glad to, because again, I do not put anything but Cain syrup on my waffle.\nThank you.\nThank you very much.\nRecognize the senator from the 41st.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nSenator, do you, you, I'm over here.\nOver here.\nYes, ma'am, I will you.\nI thank you.\nSenator, do you know what company makes the state issue laptops\nthat we all have?\nNo, but I think I'm about to find out.\nYes, isn't it true that our laptops are all a novo laptops\nthat are manufactured and made in Japan?\nI'm sure the senator knows of what she speaks.\nIsn't it true that we also just got brand new laptops?\nI'm sure the senator knows of what she speaks.\nSo is there a fiscal note associated with this portion\nof your bill?\nI know it has many, many parts on the table.\nBut the portion of your bill that talks about not being\nable to purchase things from foreign adversaries.\nIs there a fiscal note associated?\nNo, ma'am, there is no fiscal note.\nSenator, I just want to say isn't it true\nthat I have great concern about the fiscal costs\nthat would come with this.\nAnd lighted the fact that 56 of us just received\nnew laptops from China, 180 across the hall,\nalong with our admins.\nAnd so I just have grave concern\nabout the fiscal impact of having to change out\nour laptops in such a short period of time.\nSenator, I don't think the bill says anything\nabout sending anything back.\nI think it speaks to future contracts.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nSenator, would you yield, please?\nCertainly will.\nIn a true, I appreciate you bringing this great legislation.\nI like cornbread in my brains with Steve.\nWould that be okay if this bill passed?\nagain you like cornbread I like to crumble a cornbread in my\nfriends with you you know what's the difference you you know it gets in your\nstomach and it says would that be all right same way anyway that would be\nabsolutely but I don't have to put cane syrup in there no I would not advise it\nokay thank you you're welcome all right the senator from 16 the birthday man\ntoday sir thank you senator yield I will and happy birthday senator does this\nbill protect us from syrup coming from China. I guess that it does if the state\nbuys it. How about our bronze extinguisher? Can it come from China? I don't think that\nthat's possible. You don't think that's possible. It would not be bronze\nextinguisher. I don't think there's a bronze with China. I may be wrong but and if\nthere is it's nothing like the bronze with Georgia that I grew up in. Very good\nThank you, sir. You're more than welcome.\nAll right, Senator, you have a new home.\nWell, Mr. President, we have a late arriving amendment and secretary read the amendment.\nMr. President, Senator Tillery and the 19th and others offer the following amendment number\none to amend the Senate Committee's subzoot of House Bill 233 by Shriken Secretary of Commerce\non line 90 and replacing it with treasurer, Mr. President, that completes the order.\nThank you Mr. President. I appreciate the time that we're going to spend on this really\nimportant amendment. I actually, one of our colleagues wanted to file this and wasn't\nbrave enough to do so themselves, so they asked me to do it. I don't want to call them\nout at all of who that might be. But the truth is, I don't know the Secretary of Commerce.\nI hear he's a really good person, really good man. And when we're looking at fighting against\nforeign adversaries like China, I don't know that I trust someone that I don't know to\nmake the decision of who those foreign adversaries should be. But I do know somebody I trust\nto make that decision.\nAnd that's why I propose this amendment\nat the urging of the Senator from the 21st,\nbecause I know that if I have to have someone\nwho has America first, America's interest first,\nwants to fight for America first,\nthere is nobody other.\nI can't say his name, but Mr. President,\nthe Senate rules do not bar me from saying his initials.\nYou know who that would be.\nIf you want someone who will stand up for America,\nWho would that be?\nNobody other than B-L-B.\nUrge your favorable consideration of the amendment, Mr. President,\nI yield the well.\nUnless, of course, there are questions.\nDarn.\nOh, thank you, I can't.\nI can't.\nActually, you do have a later, like,\nrobbing question, right, quick.\nYou said Senator from the second.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nSenator, do you, you?\nAlways, to my friend from the second.\nAnd Senator, I think the treasurer, the gentleman from the 21st and his\ninfinite wisdom and all of his illustriousness, Senator, do you agree that the\nincoming treasurer would ensure that I-16 would have all the proper and\nnecessary resources to defend itself against all adversaries, especially\nthose that may arise from China and have the proper money to fund such endeavors.\nWould you not agree that that would be an accurate statement?\nfour and end domestic senator yes uh absolutely senator and is it not\nfurther the true that the gentleman from the 21st is of\nCajun descent and that means that that that individual is a true fighter\nI think the senator knows of what he speaks thank you so much senator\nwell senator i do think further he's told me that that third line of i-16\nwill be paved and gold i don't know where he's getting it from\nbut i've heard it might be paved and go this president there\nHe'll just turn on the print and presses up there's all he'll do\nRecognize soon from the 27th thing is presence chairman you\nChairman if you ever had the opportunity to discuss with the senator from the 21st his very specific and\nmotivational morning routine\nI've not discussed it with him, but I have heard it. Yes, sir\nWould it would you mind you recall the specific words at the center speaks to himself every morning and would you like to\nrecite those with me and the members of this chamber at this time.\nYes, sir. It's a poem. Are we ready for that?\nI'm ready. I think it starts with I. You ready?\nI look in the mirror and what do I see?\nA good looking stud named B L B. Yes, sir.\nSo what I've heard.\nChairman, do you further yield?\nYes, sir. And I do want to say that if anyone wants to add that, I would consider that\nto be a friendly amendment to the amendment.\nare you aware that the senator from the 21st wife\nhas her own version of that song\nsenator i'm not\nwould it would you like for me to\ni would love to hear it but first i must tell you and if the sergeant of\nour needs to read to read it to you remember that we do have rules of the\ncolumn in this body understood rules against disparaging another member of\nthe senate\nis it isn't not true that based on the rules of the senate going to\nAllow the senator privately to share the words of\nStead Sala. Well, that I that may be true, but senator\nSince I can't ask him a quote or can't respond to him directly\nI can't remind him that if he matches his blue button\nHe could ask a question that did tell us what his wife might say\nRecognize senator from the 20th\nThank you, Mr. President with the senator to yield and this is the best part of my business\nSenator, is it not true that I think I've sat by the senator from the 21st, 10 sessions?\nYes, so your sentence is soon over.\nI usually am confused to hear most of the time, but I'm quite confused senator and maybe you can clarify this for me.\nThis is a great amendment, but it's not signed by the senator from the 21st\nHe was busy signing dollar bills. Yes, sir\nWell, he's not wanting to shy away from self-promotion. I figured he was\nbusy doing something. Thank you\nSenator from the eight\nDoes the senator you always yield to my friend from bracing?\nI just have to ask a question. I have a amendment here on my desk that is signed by you and\nthe senator from the 18th of senator from the 50th of the senator from the 42nd. And this\namendment says that the blackberry shall be the official fruit berry of Georgia. Am I the\nonly person that has this amendment on their desk? No, sir. That was also from the senator\nfrom the 21st, if you want to challenge him, I mean, this isn't a real amendment, is\nit?\nYeah.\nThat's for each and every member to decipher himself.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nThere are no further questions.\nI yield the well and urge your favorable consideration of this extremely important amendment.\nAll right, the senator is yielding.\nDoes any other senator wish to speak for against the manager?\nChair, here's none.\nSenator from the third.\nWould you like to close his debate?\nI understand that the duties of the Treasurer are many, and I know that our senator from\nthe 21st, when he's not senator from the 21st anymore, will be spending all day signing\nthose dollar bills as they come off the printing press, and counting the gold bars at Fort\nNox and I wonder what other duties that President Trump will be giving to the new\nTreasury. And I'm wondering if among those new duties will be the ability to\ndesignate a foreign adversary. Do you know that? That's a question for the senator\nfrom the 21st. You do not know that. Okay. All right. Well, I would suggest that until\nsuch time as President Trump bestows upon his new treasure, the ability to designate for\nother countries of concern that we disregard the amendment, but we don't disregard our\nlove for the senator. I yield the well.\nThat was a real nice way of saying that, Senator.\nThat was just sweetest cornbread.\nAll right, the question is on the amendment number one authored by the senator from 19th.\nIs there objection to amendment number one?\nI have an objection. All those in favor of amendment number one will vote high. I'll oppose. No secretary in line of the machine.\nYou\nMr. Treasurer, you remember who those 17 are now.\nOn the adoption of Amendment No. 1 and the A's are 17 and the NA's are 36 and the field\ntripped the fort knocks just got fewer folks on it didn't it all right questions on the\nThe adoption of the committee's substitute is the adoption of the adoption of the committee's substitute.\nHearing none of the committee's substitute is adopted.\nIs there objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which is favorable to the past of the bill?\nChair here is none.\nThe board of the committee has agreed to.\nIs there objection to the main question being ordered?\nChair here is none.\nThe main question is ordered.\nThe question is on the passes of the bill.\nBy substitute, all those in favor of the bill will vote.\nYay, I'll oppose nay.\nSecretary, unlock the machine.\nSenator from the 27th, what purpose do you rise?\nParliamentary inquiries, President.\nStation inquiring.\nI know the United States treasurer is an extremely\nprestigious position.\nAre you aware of the academic requirements\nto fulfill such a role?\nYou know, I'm not sure the requirements.\nI know it's a very distinguished group\nof Ivy League and economists have hailed those position.\nBut I would say the senator from the 21st,\nIt was very, it was very useful when he was at LSU.\nHe was probably part of that bottom third\nthat made the top two-thirds possible, you know?\nSo, so he's always been a team player.\nAll in the past of the bill, the yeas are 52 and the days are won.\nThis bill, having received directs of constitutional majority, is therefore passed by substitute.\nSecretary reads House bill 586.\nHouse bill 586 by Representative Williamson, the 112th, and others, bill 229 to amend Article\n3, Chapter 6, the Title 40, the Fish Code of Georgia, and Tade, which intangible recorded\ntaxes to revise the notes for which such taxes imposed, were out for procedures to revise\ndefinitions to read for related matters to repeal convolcing laws and for other purposes.\nMr. President and the Senate Committee on Finance recommends that this bill do pass by sub-stuers by place minutes on a house statler chairman\nMr. President and Senate Committee on Finance offers the long substitute to House Bill 586 to build between 10 and 9 to men\nArticle 3H, Chapter 6 of the Title 48 of the U of S should go to George annotated\nWe'll need to intangible recording taxes to revise the notes for which such tax is imposed right for procedures to rise the definitions to\nprovide for late manners to the people\nCompleting laws and further purposes, Mr. President that completes the order\nThank you, Mr. President.\nThis is a banking bill and as bet to the best of my knowledge, it has absolutely nothing\nto do with the treasure of the United States.\nThis is, I bring it, House Bill 586.\nThe purpose of the bill is to redefine the time frame of a long-term note secured by real estate\nto more than 62 months for more than 36 months when any principal the note falls due.\nBy extending this time frame, House Bill 586 extends the period when the intangible recording\ntax is not applied to such long.\nThis is a bank and bill, but it's not four banks.\nIt's for consumers and it's for small business owners.\nLengthening the definition of a long-term note secured by real estate from 36 to 62 months\nwill be beneficial to borrowers of residential and commercial loans held with banks of all\nsizes.\nOn the residential side, in particular, banks that serve low-to-moderate income areas\nof the state would be better positioned to tailor mortgage products that would benefit\nborrowers, especially those who do not qualify for a traditional, conventional 30-year mortgage\nloans. The term could be longer than 36 months while retaining the benefit of keeping closing\ncosts lower since the intangible recording tax would not be applicable. This could help\npromote affordable housing. Currently, many banks have 35-month residential loan programs\nto keep initial closing costs as low as possible. Longer duration loan would give these homeowners\nmore time to consider other options when the initial loan matures increasing the likelihood\nof housing stability. For small business owners such, those small business owners financing\nthe purchase of their operating buildings with 35 month loans, would similarly benefit\nlonger duration loan with lower closing costs, give those borrowers more time to consider\noptions when the original loan maturers.\nAnd then finally, additionally, Reg Z, Regulation Z, Truth and Lending Act contains requirements\nto assure that balloon payment mortgage loans meet certain consumer protection standards.\nOne of those requirements is that the balloon payment was come due at least five years after\nthe first payment is due on the mortgage, which obviously would be 61 or 62 months from\nthe loans' origination.\nSo 62 month duration is needed in this bill to allow banks to comply with the consumer\nprotection requirement.\nAnd this federal requirement was established, balloon payment, mortgage loans.\nThis happened before the intangible recording tax was established.\nSo I can tell you that in the time that I was a banker, if I had a dime for every time\nI did a 35-month loan with a balloon on it, I would be a very rich man.\nSo I ask favourable consideration, would be glad to answer any questions.\nThank you.\nI yield the well.\nDoes any other senator wish to speak for, I guess, measure?\nIs there objection to the previous question being ordered?\nChair, here's none.\nPrevious question is ordered.\nThe question is on the adoption of the committee's substitute.\nIs there objection to the adoption of the committee's substitute?\nthe committee's substitute is adopted.\nHere's their objection to agreeing to the\nBoard of Committee, which is favorable to the\npasses of the bill.\nChair here is an unimportant committee as agreed to.\nQuestions on the passes of the bill?\nMy substitute, all those in favor of vote,\nyay, I'll pose nay, secretary, and london machine.\nYou\nAll the passes to the bill, Yez, are 55.

And indeed that did save lives. But now according to\nI will tell you personally I review all the our weekend care and urgent care in that\nblue here recently is far outpaced COVID and as you know COVID is about multiple mutations is\nnot lethal as it was. It's a matter of fact hospitalization rates from nursing home residents\nis three times more likely to have flu a couple months ago during our peak season,\nwhich many of us here had flu.\nSo that what we're doing in this bill, if you'll look specifically,\nwe are repealing the testing of residents and staff in long-term care facilities.\nAnd my amendment actually updates the influenza vaccination\nthat's being offered to discharge on patients in the hospital.\nA current guidelines has changed that from age 50 down to age 18 from that standpoint.\nSo it's not available, it's not offered, and it is offered and not mandated.\nWith that, Mr. President, I'll be happy to answer any questions.\nYeah, no questions.\nThank you.\nAsk for your final consideration.\nDoes any other senator wish to speak for against measure?\nQuestions only dops\nYeah, no other centers like speak to the amendment.

others, the bill is being denied to amend.\nTitle 1617 and 24, the push of Georgia annotated, the way to crimes and offenses, criminal procedure\nand evidence respectively, so as to provide for defendants\nto support adressification defense,\nwhile offering evidence of family violence,\ndating grounds, and child abuse committed\nby the alleged victim, to provide for a privilege\nfor

1617 and 24,\nthe OCGA, what you crimes and offenses,\ncriminal procedure, and evidence respect lose\nthat's required for dependence\nto support justification defense,\nwhile offering evidence of

one\nto amend the Sunday Committee on Judiciary\nsubstitute to House Bill 582,\nwhile replacing lines one and two with the following,\nto amend Title 1617, 24 and 45,\nthe official Georgia Ant Aid,\nwhat you crimes and offenses,\ncriminal procedure, evidence,\nand public officers and employees respectively,\nso as to provide for defendants,\nby inserting before and for other purposes,\nMr. President, they complete the order.\nWe're going to send it from the 50th.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nI rise today to bring you a more serious matter than we've had in the last couple of bills.\nI know we've had some fun today.\nBut if you would just give me your attention, this is called the Georgia Survivor Justice\nAct.\nAnd as most of you know, in the state of Georgia, according to the CDC, one in four women\nwill experience physical abuse from their intimate partner at some time, at some time\nduring their lifetime.\nAs the father of four daughters, that hits pretty close to home.\nWhat House Bill 582 does is it gives those who are victims a second chance, those who\nof our victims who have been found guilty of another crime, a second chance.\nBetween 74 and 95 percent women who are incarcerated have experienced domestic violence or sexual\nviolence.\nHouse Bill 582 would prevent survivors from serving long sentences for conduct needed for\ntheir own survival.\nHouse Bill 582 would allow Georgia's criminal law to catch up with society's modern understanding\nof domestic violence dynamics, it would enable the criminal justice system to better consider\nthe circumstances and contacts of the defendant survivors by doing the following.\nSection 2 would recognize self-defense.\nTraditional self-defense requires an immediate threat of death or serious injury.\nHowever, for victims of domestic violence, when violence in the threat of violence has\nhas been constant or has been escalated over time.\nAssess risk is based on a history of abuse.\nSection two of HP 582 allows survivors the ability\nto present self-defense by offering\nthe full context of an abusive history.\nSection three acknowledges coercion.\nCoercive control is a power and control dynamic.\nAbusers use against their victims.\nFor victims of domestic violence,\nThe ongoing threat of harm, terror, and manipulation can lead to them being coerced into actions\nagainst their will, dynamics not currently considered under Georgia law.\nSection 4 creates a path for survivors in prison.\nMany survivors are currently in prison for taking actions needed for their survival.\nThis section provides them with a mechanism to request resinnancing under our evolved\nunderstanding of domestic violence. Section 5 deals with proportionate\nsynancing for survivors. Even in cases where a conviction is imposed,\nmitigating factors, paying a fuller picture for synancing. Current law has not\nbeen adequate in ensuring survivors do not receive overly harsh synances for\nconduct in which abuse was a significant contributing factor to their\nAnd lastly, Section 6 and 7 enable victim-centered programs.\nCrime survivors regularly report needing a diverse set of tools to address and repair harm.\nEnabling victim-centered programs will respond to this need while helping survivors heal.\nThis is a good bill.\nIt prevents those who have been accused of a crime from having to serve sentences when\nAnd they were faced with the decision of whether to protect themselves or commit a crime,\nwhether to stand up to their abusers or commit a crime.\nAnd when someone makes those choices, I don't think they should be punished as harshly.\nAnd at least they should have the opportunity to paint the full picture.\nWith that, Mr. President, I'm happy to answer any questions concerning this bill.\nYou have no questions.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nThere is an amendment, and I consider it a friendly amendment.\nThe author and the house considers it a friendly amendment,\nand I think my friend from the 42nd will be talking about that too.\nThank you very much.\nThank you Senator.\nWe're going to have a senator from the 42nd to speak to his amendment.\nThank you Mr. President.\nAmendment one is actually what was House Bill 384\nthat passed unanimously in the House,\nwas unanimous in a senate judiciary committee\nsticking on the floor today.\nBut it's an important bill, and as you'll see,\nit clarifies the fact that no public officer,\nand in particular, including peace officers,\ncan be prosecuted for violating the oath of office,\nunless there's underlying crime they committed\nthat's a high-negribated misdemeanor or a felony.\nThat's important because you look at the existing law,\nthe punishment for someone being prosecuted\nabout in the north of office rises at that level from one to five.\nAnd so we have a little hole in the law.\nWe need to clarify here to make certain that\nsomeone's going to be prosecuted that's a law enforcement\nofficer or any other public officer that there actually\nis an underlying offense they committed at the same time.\nIt also in section nine, well, the way they're\nmimicking section nine of the bill will include the park\nthat standardizes what the oath is for our peace officers\nas well.\nIt comes with requests for a law enforcement community.\nI can answer any questions.\nThank you.\nIs any other senator would speak for or against the measure?\nChair, here's none.\nIs there objection to the previous question being ordered?\nChair, here's none.\nQuestions on the adoption of amendment number one,\nauthored by the senator from the 42nd.\nIs there objection to amendment number one?\nas amended, Mr. Thank you.\nWithout objection in amendment number one is adopted.\nThe question is on the adoption of the committee on the\nsubc remotely as amended is there is an assumption of the\ncommittee substitute as amended, he is none the committee\nsubstitute as amended as adopt it.\nIs the objection\nto agree to\nand to agree to which is favorable if the pass to the bill...\nChair has none.\non the past of the bill, all those in favor vote, yay.\nAll opposed, nay, secretary, I'm not the machine.\nYou\nAll the patches of the bill, the A's are 53 of the NA, it's one.\nThis bill having received the requisite constitution majority is therefore passed by substitute.\nSecretary House bill 567.\nHouse bill 567.\nWe're going to send them to you.\nThe 13th and others.\nThe bill is being sent to Man Article 2, Chapter 11, Title 43, the official go to Georgia\nAnti-Aid.\nWe're going to licenses for the practice of dentistry, so as to authorize and regulate\ntele dentistry by licensing dentists in the state, to record definitions for exemptions\nand conditions to write for authorized practices to provide for dentists, to write for ownership\nof documents, to write for a limited number of dental hygienists to perform teledoms\nto treat or certain conditions, to write for rules and regulations to amend Article 1\nof Chapter 24, Title 33, the official code of the Georgia Ant Aid.\nOnly two general provisions of insurance, so I'll allow for coverage of dental services\nprovided through teledoms to treat, to write for a lay to manage, to write for effective\ndates for real public and lots, and for other purposes, Mr. President of the St.\nQway and the Health and Human Services recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute\ncertainly submitted, Senator Watson-Chairman.\nMr. President, the same committee and health and human\nservices are responding substitute to House Bill of\nHouse degrees 7, to be able to maintain an act to amend\nArticle 2, Chapter 11, Title 43, those\nthat you are able to license for the practice of\ndentistry, so as to authorize and regulate\ntele dentistry, by instance, dentists in this state.\nIt's a right for definitions and for the purposes,\nMr. President, I complete the order.\nWe're going to add a center from the 48.\nThank you, Mr. President and colleagues, I bring you House Bill 567, all of the dentistry.\nYou may recall this bill from last year, it passed this chamber, it passed the House,\nBut unfortunately, it had a billing error that caused our\nwonderful governor to have to veto it.\nSo we've made a couple of minor changes.\nAnd I think everybody's on board.\nHP 5607 will authorize and regulate the practice of\nteledenistry by Georgia License Dennis and Hyde Dennis.\nVia the Georgia Board of Dentistry to ensure patient safety\nremains the priority.\nWhile maintaining a continuous standard of care and\nsustaining the Georgia License Dennis is the leader of\nthe oral health care team.\nIt allows patients without a dental home\nto establish care with a dental provider\nin order to receive a consultation\nand direct appropriate care.\nIt allows dentists to use teledenistry\nto use hygienists to perform specific hygiene functions,\npermitted under general supervision and accordance\nwith existing law.\nIt requires the patient dentists both be physically located\nin Georgia with the dentists verifying\nthe patient's location, identity,\nin obtaining patient consent.\nWhat it does not do, it does not create unreasonable scope\nexpansions, it does not replace the need for in-person\ndental exams and procedures.\nIt does not require patients to sign waivers\nreleasing provider supply ability in any time.\nIt does not change what is currently allowed\nunder any part of the general supervision code.\nIt does not negatively impact oral health care,\ncurrently allowed in Title I schools,\npreschools, long-term care facilities and nursing homes,\nand it does not mandate insurance coverage\nof teledenistry.\nThat was the key from last year.\nIt's a pretty simple straightforward bill.\nMost of you have seen this before.\nHappy answering questions.\nI ask your federal consideration for HB 567.\nI yield the one.\nDoes any of the senator wish to speak?\nOr I guess the measure.\nIs there a Jackson previous question being ordered?\nChair has not a previous question as a word.\nQuestion is on the adoption of the committee.\nSubstitute is there objection to adoption of the committee?\nSubstitute.\nHearing none of the committee's substitute is adopted.\nIs there objection to agreeing to the 40 committee,\nwhich is favorable to the passes of the bill?\nChair, here's none of the important committee is agreed to.\nIs there objection to the main question being ordered?\nChair, here's none of the main question is ordered.\nQuestion is on the passes of the bill.\nMy substitute, all those in favor of the bill will vote.\nYay.\nOpposed, ladies and gentlemen, I'm not in the machine.\nYou\nYou\nAll in the passage of the bill, the A's are 52 and the A's are 1, this bill hasn't received\na rickston.\nConstitution Majority is there for pass by safety.\nSecretary Reed, House Bill 36.\nHouse Bill 36.\nWith the V6, 5% of the lever at the 123rd and others, we will turn on the act to amend the file 29 of those DGA by 2 Guardian Awards as the revised list of providers who are authorized to participate in the processes for appointment of a guardian for an adult, the modification and termination of such guardianship and the appointment of emergency guardian to revise the list of providers who are authorized to participate in the processes for appointment of a conveyor for an adult to the modification and the termination of such conveyor ship and the appointment of the emergency conservator to provide for limitations of the powers and defeats\nof certain emergency conservators to arise and provide for definitions to\narrive for later matters to build and looking laws and for other purposes.\nMr. President of the St.\nCommittee on Judiciary recommends that this bill do pass by substitute\ntype of its minutes in a Strickland chairman.\nMr. President of the St.\nCommittee on Judiciary Office of Law and Substitute to House Bill 36,\nthe bill to maintain an act to amend Title 29 of the CJA,\nwhich regarding the award test provides the list of providers that were authorized\nto participate in the processes for appointment of a guardian for an adult,\nthe modification and termination of such guardianship and the appointment of an emergency guardian\nto rise the list of providers who are authorized to participate in the processes for the appointment of a conservative for an adult and for other purposes.\nMr. President, Senator Eccles of 49th and other drop of the following amendment number one to amend House Bill 86 by deleting marriage and family therapists or each time it occurs by deleting marriage and therapy therapists, each time it occurs.\nMr. President, that completes the order.\nWe're going to sit in front of the first.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nI bring you House Bill 36.\nThis is originally brought by the probate court judges and the House represented to basically\nbecause of the logjam or delays that they're experiencing when it comes to appointing\na guardian or a conservative ship.\nSo they wanted to expand the folks who can do this related to that.\nThe currently only physician psychologist and licensed clinical social workers are\nauthorized to do the evaluation and this is on folks with developmental disabilities.\nSo it adds physician's assistance nurse practitioners and clinical nurse\nspecialists with special training in psychiatric and mental health. Marriage\nof family therapists and professional counselors but in agreement with the\nprobate judges and with the author in the house you'll see the amendment that\nthat the senator from the 49th who's well versed in developmental disability issues, removes\nand strikes and deletes marriage and family therapist.\nSo that is an amendment that certainly I'm in agreement with that he sponsored and I\nsigned it and the author is in the house as an agreement with it and the probate judges\nare in agreement with it.\nSo basically for an evaluation to perform this evaluation, this will be for PAs, Physicians\nAssistance, Nurse Bright Testors, Clinical Nurse Specialist, Psychiatric Mental Health,\nand Licensed Professional Counselors, and all those with training, their training includes\ndevelopmental disability.\nBut let me just say that you'll see in Section 12 of the bill that an adult should not\nbe presumed to be in need of a conservative solely based on the findings of\nadult one or more developmental disabilities as defined in the paragraph so\nthat is will not be any of the criteria for those with developmental\ndisabilities when it comes to hearing towards our conservative issue and that's\nwhat it does. Mr. President, I'm happy to answer any questions thank you\nto ask for your favourable consideration.\nDoes any other senator wish to speak for against measure?\nHere's none is there objection to the previous question being ordered\nSenator for the first what purpose you rise\nStation choir was the amendment was that with a minimum withdrawn or spoken to\nGood call senator\nmissed it\nSenator from 49th would you like to speak to the amendment senator spoke to it, so yeah, yeah, I'm good\nCenter from the 41st you'd like to speak on the amendment. All right, come on. I'm sorry. I misunderstood you whales yours\nYou\ncenter from the 41st waves. So, question is on amendment number one. Is there objection\namendment number one? There is objection. I have objection for amendment number one.\nAll right, all those of favorite amendment number one was vote.\nYay, I'll pose nay, secretary and lot of machine.\nStand here for the first.\nParliament are requiring station requirement.\nIsn't it true that this amendment is one that we have carefully\ncrafted with the council developmental disabilities,\nprobate judges, and the author of this bill.\nAnd the Senator from 49th and I are all in full agreement\nwith this amendment.\nNo question, y'all work.\nA lot of hours on this bill and to craft it perfectly,\nor best you can't get to.\nSenator from the 41st.\nPollyman should inquire.\nSation inquire.\nIsn't it true that people who have an LMFT\nalso have very substantial training, just like a LPC does, isn't it true?\nThe center is passionate about what she speaks.\nOn the adoption of the amendment number one, the yeas are 38, the nays are 13,\nand this amendment has been adopted.\nQuestions on the adoption of the committee to as amended is their objection to adoptions the committee sub two that amended\nChair here is not in the committee sub Do diss amended, isn't there objection to Extreme to the overlord committee which is favorable to the passage of the bill\nChair here's done before the committee has agreed to is there objection to the main question being ordered chair. Here is none of questions ordered questioning is all the passes of the bill\nAll those are favor vote. Yay by opposed name shaped hearing EXI Beaun Panning\nYou\nYou\nOn the passes of the bill, the A's are 49, A's are 4, this bill haven't received the\nrequisite constitutional majority, is there for pass-by substitute?\nSecretary House Bill 148.\nHouse Bill 148, Representative Carson, the 46th and others, bill is being counted like\nto mention.\nChapter 3, title 43.\nThe official got to Georgia annotated with two accounts, and so as the revised provisions\nrelated to education experience requirements\nof certified public accountants.\nTo revise provisions related to licensure,\naffirmous practicing public accountancy.\nTo revise provisions related to reciprocity,\nto conform terminology to a men article one\non chapter 81 on title 36 of the official Georgia entity,\nrelated to local government budget and audit.\nSo it's to conform a cross reverence\nto the right related matters.\nRight from the back to date,\nyou'll be able to be looking at laws\nand for other purposes.\nMost of the President of the Senate\ncan land right in the streets and utilities.\nRecommends that this bill do pass\nrespectfully, it's minutes in our councillor chairman.\nSecond, please do it from Mr. President.\nI recognize the senator from the fourth.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nI would first of all get into this bill.\nI'd like to thank some people that\nworks so hard on this bill.\nAnd that's Vice President of Legislative Fears,\nDon Cook, Board, Search, who is the Executive Director\nof Georgia Science CPAs, and Miss Catherine Flescher,\nwho is the current Chairman of the Board\nof Georgia Science CPA.\nThis provides a new pathways for people\nto receive their CPA license.\nAnd just like all other professions that I know of\nand I talked to, we all have shortage of qualified people\nin our profession.\nAnd this provides two other pathways\nin addition to what we have now.\nSo Georgia currently has a structure that has been in place\nsince 1998, but President does not meet the needs\nof our profession.\nCurrently, the Georgia Public Accounting Act\nrequires CPA candidates, sorry, currently Georgia Public\nAccounting Act requires CPA candidates to pass all parts\nto CPA exam, to bleed 150 hours of credit hours,\nqualify an education, and gain one year\nof relevant work experience before becoming\nlife of CPA. This house bill does not change that at all. In fact, it has two more ways to it.\nBut this is an attempt to address the profession's demands and some of the challenges in getting\nto life. House bill 148 proposes to add two other ways to become a Georgia life of CPA,\nas well as establish and practice privilege requirements for out of state CPAs to practice\nin Georgia. So let's talk about the pathways that pathways all three of them existed in two\nSo under this bill beginning January 1, 2026, the Georgia State Board of\nCounty will be able to license a person to the CPA, first one is what we already\nhave, completes 150 credit hours of qualifying education, has at least one year of\nreal-world work experience and passes the CPA exam. Number two, and that's why I\nfailed under, I was licensed under, I had a bachelor degree with the\nI had to leave two years of experience and I had to pass the CP exam and it did take me\nfive times to pass them.\nAlso the third measure is that you have a master's degree with emphasis in accounting\nas established by a state board and it leaves one year experience and pass the CP exam.\nSo this is loud enough to go for one way to become a CPA to actually three ways and\nAnd in no way does it diminish our credibility of our profession.\nIn many places, our profession is held esteem among all other professions.\nSo these pathways are being looked at by many other states.\nSo let me just tell you in conclusion, House Bill 148 provides Georgia with two new routes\nto the CPI-Losher as well as practice privilege requirements that will make it more efficient\nWe're all out of state CPAs to provide audit services in Georgia.\nThis bill is backed by the Georgia Society of CPAs,\nGeorgia State Board of Accountancy, and the National County Plurms.\nThis bill passed a house 172-0 and passed the Senate Committee 8-0.\nMr. President, I yield a will.\nDoes any of the Senator wish to speak for against the measure?\nIs there objection to the previous question being ordered?\nChair here is not in previous question as ordered.\nIs there objection to agreeing to the committee report of the committee,\nwhich is favor to the passes of the bill?\nChair here is not in before the committee is agreed to.\nIs there objection to the main question being ordered?\nChair here's none and the main question is ordered.\nQuestion is on the passes of the bill,\nall those in favor vote gay or pose day,\nsector and lot of machine.\nYou\nOn the passes of the bill, yeas are 52, nays are zero.\nThis bill has received requisite constitutional majority zero for a pass.\nMr. President, I move the Senate table, the remaining legislation on the Senate rules calendar.\nAll right, it's objection, out objection, they are tabled.\nAll right, so what we're going to do, we're going to, we're going to stand at ease for dinner.\nAnother pro chance got dinner for the chamber and everything.\nSo we're going to, we're going to stand at ease.\nIt's in the secretary's break room is where the dinner will be.\nAnd we'll try to reconvene by 72730, I guess.\nI was trying to get us out of here, y'all.\nI was trying to get us out of here, but they overruled me.\nAll right, everybody go have dinner.\nEnjoy it with Cennetees.\nYou\n",
