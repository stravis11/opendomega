chaplain this afternoon will be introduced by the lady from the 56th House District\nrepresenting Mission Mainter, representing Mainter.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nI am so happy to introduce to you today our chaplain, Rabbi Medwin.\nShe is a rabbi at the temple, which is right at the tip of my district.\nShe's a native of Memphis, Tennessee, which is where I grew up for a little bit.\nA lot of people may not know that.\nkindergarten through third grade, I was in Memphis, Tennessee.\nMy mom was an air traffic controller.\nBut Rabbi Medwin has three children,\nand I initially met her with the Ross Child Social Justice\nCenter.\nShe is going to grace us with a word, but before I go on,\nI want to just let you know a little bit about her.\nShe attended the University of Texas in Austin\nand Hebrew University in Jerusalem for undergraduate studies,\nearning degrees in Middle Eastern studies,\nand honors and humanities.\nShe was ordained on the Los Angeles campus\nof Hebrew Union College in May of 2010.\nWhile there, she received a Master's of Hebrew letters\nand a Master's in Jewish education.\nLet us please welcome Rabbi Medwin.\nThank you.\nGood afternoon.\nI have the honor of serving the temple, which is a synagogue here in Midtown, Atlanta,\nunder the senior leadership of Rabbi Peter Berg, who sends his regards along with the entire\nclergy team and staff and community here in Atlanta.\nThank you so much for the honor of getting to speak in front of this esteemed assembly\ntoday.\nAnd special thanks to Speaker Burns and to Representative Maynard for this invitation\ntoday.\nThe second day of your legislative session, 2024.\nAnd for the ways that this assembly has been supportive of the Jewish community, especially\nin the wake of October 7th, and your stand against anti-Semitism, along with Islamophobia\nand all forms of hate, we are in your debt.\nThank you so much.\nIt is because of the ways that this assembly works when it's at its best, robust debate,\ncollegial respect, a thirst for solutions that include compromise and inclusion of diversity\nof ideas that we live into the fullest potential of this great state of Georgia.\nAnd I know that this process of argue, of debate, is not always an easy one.\nFor most people, disagreement can be uncomfortable at best, and frankly, most of us think it's\nnot all that fun.\nI remember when I was a rabbi back in Los Angeles,\na friend of mine who was a Catholic priest,\ncame into the synagogue to teach some classes.\nAnd he was pretty sure he confided in me later\nthat for the first couple of months,\nnot a soul in their liked him very much.\nBecause they kept arguing with him\nabout every little point he was making.\nHe was a custom you see to teaching in churches\nwhere people sat politely and they listened nicely.\nAnd it wasn't until he sat at the rabbi's Passover\nsatir dinner table, where he witnessed this process\nof arguing and debating happening in front of his eyes\nbetween everybody there.\nAnd even the rabbi's children were asking the rabbi,\ntheir father, all kinds of questions\narguing every little point.\nHe realized that actually people in the synagogue\nliked him very much, that the arguing was a form of engagement\nand approval and a way to express care about the ideas\nthat were being expressed.\nHe learned an important point.\nThat arguing doesn't have to be mean,\nor it doesn't mean something bad.\nIn fact, arguing is a form of clarifying our intentions\nand ideas, a sign of engagement, and a sacred act\nwhen it's done well.\nThe Jewish tradition teaches there are two kinds\nof arguments in this world, an argument that is\nfor the sake of heaven and an argument\nthat is not for the sake of heaven.\nAn argument whose point is to build the future\nand one whose point is to cut off the future.\nAn argument that sharpens ideas on both sides\nand one that clouties and dulls.\nEvery argument for the sake of heaven is destined to endure,\nbut if it is a trivial or misguided or abusive argument,\nit will quickly become a footnote in history.\nExamples of this kind of argument are found throughout Jewish tradition, but especially\nin the form of two rabbis whose names are Hillel and Shamai.\nHillel and Shamai lived about 2,000 years ago, and these two rabbis could fight like the\nDickens.\nFor generations of their students afterwards, they are arguing continued each house challenging\none another relentlessly when it came to ethics and morals in the ways they understood\nof God speaking to them in their lives.\nDuring one particularly fierce argument,\nan argument that lasted for three years,\nfinally a heavenly voice came down and said,\nyou and you are both representing the living words of God.\nBut the law is like the house of Hillel.\nYou see, both of their arguments were actually right,\nGod thought.\nBoth of them made wonderful arguments and points.\nThey had good intentions.\nThey were fighting with truthfulness\nand with integrity with one another.\nBut God knew eventually the people needed a final answer.\nAnd so the law went according to the House of Hillel\nbecause according to our tradition,\nHillel was the one who was able not just to teach\ntheir own ideas but also to teach their opponent's ideas.\nIn fact, they taught their opponent's ideas first\nbefore teaching and arguing their own points.\nIn other words, they argued better with a higher quality of argument.\nAs an aside, we learn later that though these houses fall with unparalleled ferocity,\nthey still broke bread together in the evenings, and their children still married into each\nother's families.\nThey remained humans to one another beyond the arguments about which they felt so intensely.\nof the state of Georgia. Here at the beginning of your legislative session, you will argue\nwith your colleagues. This is not a bug in our system. This is actually a feature.\nArguing is not a sign of disunity or dysfunction. It is a sign that you are engaged in that\nyou care. It is evidence that there are values and ideas and people's lives that you care\nabout and that are on the line in this room. And you were elected to fight for those ideas\nand values and the people you represent.\nBut there are arguments that are for the sake of heaven\nand there are arguments that, for their partisanship\nor falseness or pettiness, will soon be footnotes in history.\nThere are ways to argue and fight that preserve the humanity\nof your opponent and there are ways to fight that dehumanize\nas we know and disregard.\nIt takes a sense of humility to learn more\nabout your opponent's argument and understand it from a place\nof principle and integrity, and it takes a sense of patience and a willingness to engage\nin issues to create legislation that will tackle our state's most entrenched problems.\nAnd so I want to invite you now to please rise as we offer a prayer on this opening day\nof your second day of session, God, who blessed our ancestors with a fire in their bellies\nto fight for your sake, we pray for all of those in this chamber today.\nWe pray that their arguments ring clear and true, sharpened by their opponents' rebuttals.\nWe pray that they stand for what they believe is right and truthful, for themselves,\nfor their constituents, and especially for those who are the most vulnerable to the outcomes\nof their decisions.\nWe pray that there is room also to tolerate someone else's principled position.\nWe pray their willingness to work together with those who do not share their party or opinion\nwill stay strong.\nthat civility and the ability to argue well is a cornerstone of our democracy.\nAnd we pray that their friendships across the aisle will strengthen them and nourish\nthem and encourage them to argue better.\nFor not many people get to sit in these seats and know the job as they do.\nThe truth is every single one of these legislators God needs the other to argue with during the\nday and to break bread with when the day is done. As the famous Jewish philosopher and\ndoctor, my monodies once said, God, we pray. He said, I'll destroy my enemies by converting\nthem to friends. May they find wonderful opponents and one another with ideas that stretch\ntheir own imaginations. May God bless you each as you come into this place with health.\nMay God bless you as you take your leave here each day in health.\nMay God bless your work as arguments for the sake of goodness,\nwholeness, and righteousness for all Georgians.\nAnd we say together, amen.\nPlease remain standing for the pledge of allegiance.\nI pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America\nand to the Republic for which it stands, one nation\nunder God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.\nThe doorkeepers, you can unlock the doors.\nMembers, you may greet the rabbi in the south any room and have a photo opportunity.\nYou may do that now if you so like.\nYou\nYou\nMembers, we do have a doctor of the day downstairs that representative Sheila Jones has invited\nfrom the 60th.\nThank you, Sheila, for inviting the doctor of the day.\nDr. Walton McClellan is downstairs, and this is Dr. Walton right here, so maybe he's\nwatching.\nSo let's give him a round of applause as a thank you for being here and taking care of\nus today.\nWe represent you, Jones, let him know that we really appreciate him being here.\nThanks for that.\nChair recognizes Chairman Tarvan, the Chair of the Committee on Information and Audits.\nChairman Tarvan.\nMr. Speaker, your Committee on Information and Audits has read the journals from the previous\nlegislated today and found it to be correct.

With that\nwe have a moment of silence and memory of Mark McIntyre.\nThank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.\nThank you, members.\nLet's recognize this Savannah Chatham delegation and the former mayor of Savannah, Representative\nEdna Jackson.\nif you'll please rise again for this remembrance.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nIt is with sadness that I announced, on last week's Tuesday, we had the inauguration\nof our mayor, Van Johnson, for the second term.\nHis family came all the way from New York to be a part of that celebration.\nUnfortunately, on Wednesday morning, his father passed away.\nI ask that you have given us a moment of silence as we know that he is in a better place\nand that our mayor is going to carry on as he always has.\nThank you.\nMay we pray.\nThank you.\nThank you Delegation and Representative Jackson.\nChairman Jay Collins has recognized for an afternoon order.\nThank you Mr. Speaker.\nMany of you know today is law enforcement appreciation day in our nation.\nUnfortunately, we got some really terrible news just a few weeks ago when the fraternal\norder of the police released their findings from 2023. 378 peace officers were shot in the\nline of duty, the highest number ever since that statistic has been recorded. 138 law enforcement\nofficers in our nation were ambushed in 115 separate attacks throughout our nation. This\nThis state lost five peace officers last year and has already lost one in the line of duty.\nThis house has continued to lead during my tenure here in the house and the words that\nI want to use, I want to be very careful here.\nMany in this chamber have continued to support law enforcement over the years.\nYou've shown support with your votes.\nYou've shown support with the way that you posture in your politics and the policy that\nyou stand for.\nLadies and gentlemen, in today's society, our law enforcement, our men and women are under\nattack and they have been and I appreciate those men and women who serve and care that\nthin blue line with them every day and stand on that thin blue line.\nI just wanted to ask for a moment of silence for all of those that we lost and a moment\nof respect for those who stand on that thin blue line and they protect and honor and serve\nthis community in this state every day and they selfishly give of their time and their\nability to protect us so please we could have a moment of silence.\nThank you Mr. Speaker.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nHow about representing Trayette, and you're ready?\nAs soon trained as recognized for an afternoon order,\nyou have the will.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nI rise today to talk about maternal mortality here in Georgia.\nNow, around the country, the rates of maternal mortality\nis increasing, but unfortunately,\nGeorgia is leading the way.\nWith, on average, across the country,\naround 30.2 women for every 100,000 birds,\n30.2 women die from maternal mortality, but in Georgia, the rate is much higher.\nAmong white women, the rate is 23.3 per 100,000 births, and horrifically, among black women,\nit is 48.6 per 100,000 births.\nWe are leading the country in maternal mortality.\nAnd while we're leading the country in business development, we're failing the mothers in our\nstate.\nAnd we need to change that.\nWe need to show the country how to lower maternal mortality throughout the country by showing\nhow we do it in the state of Georgia.\nAnd I finished with this last tidbit of you wondering why Asians aren't listed.\nAnd it's under 5% we do not list those statistics out of privacy concerns.\nThank you.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nThank you, representatives.\nYou are at the well.\nLet's see.\nRepresentative Donahue and Representative Barry Fleming recognized for an afternoon order.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nday on your desk, Rep. Fleming and I, we had the privilege of something I have been blessed\nto do a couple times since Rep. Paul Battles was here. This is called Join Peace, My Daily\nDevotion. In each one of you, I hope every day you start your day off with this. And just\nto say something here, yesterday, the first day of session, choose life that you may love\nthe Lord your God that you may obey His voice and that you may cling to Him.\nWith that, an amazing aspect of God's love for us is the fact that He gives us choices.\nAnd we make choices each and every day.\nSo remember that what we do affects the state of Georgia, what we do will affect our families.\nHowever, if you spend this day and every day just getting to know the Lord, it will change\nthings in Georgia and in the House and Mr. Speaker I thank you and\nRepresentative Lenin.
