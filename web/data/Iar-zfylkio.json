We are going\nto have the roll call. All members\npresent will please vote green to\nsignify their presence in the chamber.\nAnd Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the\nmachines?\nHave all members voted themselves in?\n>> If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the\nmachines?\nDoorkeepers, will you close the doors\nand keep them closed?\nAs is our custom, we will begin our day\nwith scripture reading and prayer by our\nchaplain, after which we will pledge\nallegiance to the flag of our country.\nOur chaplain this morning will be\nintroduced by the gentleman from the\n17th House District, Representative\nMartin Mahan.\nRepresentative Martahan.\nWell, thank you, Mr. Speaker,\nand good morning members.\nY'all today it is my honor to introd\nintroduce Pastor Kevin Boy and his\nlovely wife Don today.\nKevin Pastor Kevin Boy is an outreach\npastor at Westeridge Church in Dallas\nwhere he has led the church's local and\nglobal outreach initiatives since 2018.\nThat includes Hope for Christmas, a\nmulti-church Christmas outreach program\nBirth at West Ridge that supplies gifts\nand food to about 3,500 families in\n10,000 children in the Northwest Georgia\nregion every year at Christmas time.\nY'all, it's a unbelievable endeavor\nand something that I had never seen and\nI could not believe until I saw it when\nI went there.\nHe also leads a church's special needs\nministry which recently opened a 10,000\nsquare foot building constructed for the\nexclusive use of individuals with\nspecial needs and its growing foster\ncare ministry.\nAnd prior to becoming an ordained\nminister, joining his older brother, uh,\nBrian, the founding pastor of West\nRidge, and his late father as Christian\nministers, Kevin served for 25 years at\nthe Georgia Hospital Association.\nKevin is a great friend. He is a\nwonderful pastor. He is a man of our\ncommunity and a man of faith. And I am\nso excited to welcome him here into the\npeople's house.\n>> Thank you.\n>> Thank you all so much. Um, I wanted to\nfirst thank my dear friend and\nrepresentative Martin Mahan for inviting\nme to briefly share with you and pray\nfor you this morning. What an honor.\nIt's not only a huge honor for me to\nstand at this podium under the gold\ndome. It's truly a full circle moment\nfor me having spent so many days here in\nmy previous career advocating for\nGeorgia hospitals, attending numerous\ncommittee meetings and celebrating the\ngreat work that hospitals do throughout\nthe state. I'm so proud and thankful\nthat that for that time in my life and\nI'm thrilled to be back under the gold\ndome after all these years. this time as\na pastor. It truly is a surreal moment\nfor me. Having been born in 1969,\nI remember the days when you had to wait\nfor the local\nand national news to come on the\ntelevision or radio to really find out\nwhat was happening in the world. If you\nwanted to get your sports score of your\nfavorite team, you had to wait for the\nmorning paper to hit your driveway. Do\nyou remember those days? Um, if you\nwanted if that team played on the West\nCoast, well, you were out of luck. That\nthe uh the game ended much too late for\nthe morning print edition and you had to\nfind out the the scores from a different\nsource. Uh, you needed to find some real\nin-depth information on anything. Uh,\nyou had to go to the public library. You\nremember those days? Uh, while the\nworld, can we agree that the world has\nchanged? Uh, today, thanks to\ntechnology, it takes me about 5 seconds\nto go on my phone and look up something\nas random as who was the 1935\nbest actor winner in the Academy Awards.\nAnd thanks to the internet and now\nartificial intelligence, we can access\nan avalanche of information on any topic\nthat you can think of instantaneously.\nBut do you know what the amazing irony\nof this whole explosion of information\nis?\nAs much information is now instantly\navailable to all of us, what is the one\nthing that we seem to be missing more\nthan ever? I would say it's the truth.\nCan we all agree that it seems that the\ntruth is so much harder to ascertain\nthese days? Here is how we how is it\nthat we can see all of the same videos,\nlook at the same pictures, and come to\ncompletely different conclusions on what\nactually happened.\nWe all ask is the video AI generated or\nmodified? Was this pic photoshopped?\nDoes the distributor of the video have a\npolitical agenda? So, we have evolved\ninto a culture that is desperately\nsearching for the truth. And because we\nbought Satan's lies that are tr that the\ntruth is relative and everyone has their\nown truth. We're living in a sea of\nconfusion which only leads to anger and\nbitterness and depression and anxiety\nand all the chaos that we see in our\nculture today.\nI am here to remind you as a pastor that\ndespite what we're hearing in the media,\nthere is an absolute truth that we can\nalways depend on. In John 14:6, Jesus\nsays, \"I am the way\nand the truth and the life. No one comes\nthrough the Father except through me.\"\nIn a world that is desperately searching\nfor the truth, may I submit to you today\nthat we've had access to it all along\nin Jesus and this God inspired book\ncalled the Bible.\nThrough this divinely inspired book, we\nhave all we need to navigate this world\nin truth.\nPastor Tony Evans defines the truth as\nthe absolute objective standards of\nobject objective standard of God's\nperspective on any given subject which\nexists independently of human feelings,\nopinions or consensus.\nIn other words, the truth is not\nsubjective.\nOur goal should be to align ourselves\nwith God's perspective on all things\nbecause he is the only source of truth,\nnot personal or cultural preferences.\nAnd when we reject God's truth, chaos\nensues. And I think we can agree that\nwe're seeing that in our culture today.\nI know some of you here don't believe\nthat Jesus is the truth, the light and\nthe way. And my challenge to you is\nthis. Put aside any politics and\ninvestigate it for yourself by reading\nthis book and making a more informed\ndecision about Jesus.\nIn John 8:31-32,\nJesus told those who believed in him,\n\"If you continue in my word, you really\nare my disciples.\nYou will know the truth, and the truth\nwill set you free.\"\nWhat a great promise that is. For those\nof you who identify as Christ followers,\nand I know there's a lot of you here\ntoday, I want to acknowledge this from\nmy many years of experience here at the\nCapitol. It's extremely difficult to\nlive out your faith here. I know that.\nAnd let's be honest, some of you have\ncompletely lost your way spiritually.\nIn James 4 7 through verses 7-8, James\nencourages believers to submit to God\nand surrender to him as your ultimate\nauthority.\nIn the next verse, he says, \"Draw near\nto God and he will draw near to you.\"\nBut notice this, you need to make the\nfirst move.\nIn these chaotic times when your\nconstituents are drowning in information\nbut starving for the truth, we can we\nall agree that while your job here at\nthe capital is so important and so\nthankful for you.\nNo political party or leader is going to\nsolve our problems, no political party\nor leader has a monopoly on the truth.\nBut Jesus is truth.\nHis word is the guide book for our\nlives. He is the only hope we have in\nthis world.\nAnd when we finally start living our\nlives like God is telling the truth,\nonly then will be will we be truly free.\nThank you guys so much uh for your\nattention and this great honor to be\nhere today. Let's pray. If you would\nstand and let's pray.\nGod, thank you so much for this\nopportunity. Lord, I thank you for every\nman and woman who are here this morning,\nespecially our our uh elected officials\nwho are doing the work that you've\ncalled them to do. Lord, what a huge\nresponsibility, especially during these\ntumultuous times, Lord. I pray right now\nthat you would that we would walk in\ntruth, the truth of your word, the truth\nof your promises, Lord. And I pray, God,\nthat we would not put our faith in\nparties and and leaders, Lord, but only\nin you, Lord. I pray for each one of our\nlegislators, Lord, who are elected by\nthe people of Georgia. I pray that you\nwould just give them wisdom and\ndiscernment in all things, Lord. And I\npray that they would proceed in\neverything that they do with the\nattitude of you, not I, Lord. I pray\nthat you would put you first in all\nthings, Lord. Thank you for this great\nstate of Georgia and the incredible\nleaders that we have. We're so blessed\nto be in this state and we just pray\nthat you would just continue to prosper\nuh our people, Lord. And I pray that we\nas a state would put you first in all\nthings. Thank you again for this\nincredible opportunity. We ask for\nblessings on this day and all the\nproceedings that are that are to follow.\nIn Jesus name we pray. Amen.\n>> All right, let's let's do the pledge of\nallegiance.\n>> I aliance to the flag United States of\nAmerica and to the republic for it\nstands one nation\nindivisible\nand justice for all\nstay up here a minute doorkeepers you\nmay unlock the doors brother Kevin thank\nyou for those words thank you to Don and\nto both of you being here with us today\nwe most appreciate it appreciate your\nservice in the community as well members\nyou may join Brother Kevin in the South\nAnnie room in just a moment and thank\ngive him your appreciation for being\nhere.\nMembers, our doctor of the day is Dr. Ra\nMuna.

Uh thanks\nto the work of Commissioner Patricia\nRoss of our Department of Veteran\nServices, they identified an additional\ngroup that is federally recognized to be\nburied in one of our state cemeteries.\nSo if you would bear with me for just a\nmoment, I'm going to tell you a little\nbit of the story of this very specific\ngroup who will now have this benefit.\nAs the Vietnam War raged in Southeast\nAsia during the 1960s and 70s, a\nseparate United Statesbacked operation\nwas also underway in neighboring Laos.\nKnown as the Secret War, the CIA\nrecruited tens of thousands of Mung\nsoldiers for covert operations. These\nsecret fighters were known as special\nguerilla units or SGUs. Their missions\nincluded scouting enemy movements,\nfighting on the front lines, recruiting,\nrescuing downed American pilots, and\nprotecting US facilities in Laos. It is\nestimated that between 30 and 40,000 M\nsoldiers died during this secret war\nwith many more wounded. These brave\nfighters consistently fought against\nsuperior odds and inflicted countless\ndamage to communist communist forces in\nLaos.\nAs the war in Vietnam ended, so did this\nsecret war. As US forces left Southeast\nAsia, the Mung people were left to fend\nfor themselves and experienced\npersecution from the Le Oceanian\ngovernment. Many were able to escape to\nAmerica, but it was not until 1994 that\nthe secret war was officially\nacknowledged by our government with the\nbenefit of burial in a national cemetery\nto follow in 2018.\nIt wasn't until 2000 that federal law\nallowed these members to become US\ncitizens. So, the question could be\nasked, why is this important to you and\nme and the people of Georgia? Well, as\nformer CI director William Colby summed\nit up, the efforts of the Mung Special\nGuerilla units saved more than 50,000\nAmerican lives in Southeast Asia.\nFriends,\nthat is 50,000 fewer names to be\nengraved on the Vietnam War Memorial in\nWashington, DC.\nThat's more men like Chairman Hitchens,\nRepresentative Williams, and\nRepresentative Griffin being here today.\nNow, we are honored, Mr. Speaker, to\nhave in the gallery uh some of these\nMung fighters. They are accompanied here\ntoday by Commissioner of our Department\nof Veteran Services, Trisha Ross, along\nwith members of the Veterans of Foreign\nWar that fought alongside these brave\nmen and women. So, if you would please\nstand and let us honor you.\nThank you colleagues for allowing me to\npresent the bill today. I certainly hope\nyou will support 985 as this is the\nleast we can do for these brave men and\nwomen. With that, Mr. Speaker, I'll\nstand for any questions.\n>> Gentlemen, yield for a question.\nRepresentative Al Williams to your left\nis recognized for a question.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is it and thank\nyou, Mr. Chairman, for this bill. Is it\nnot true that it's never too late to do\nthe right thing?\nAbsolutely. I appreciate the question.\n>> Is it not further true that these\ngentlemen certainly are responsible for\nthe saving of many lives during Vietnam?\nAnd I'm sure Colonel Hitchens and\nColonel Griffin agrees with me that\nwe're just glad we're able to stand here\nand recognize them.\n>> Absolutely. Thank you for the question.\n>> Gentleman has a couple more questions.\nRepresentative Tran is recognized for a\nquestion to your left in the back.\nRepresentative Tran.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, thank you, Mr.\nChairman, for bringing this bill to the\nfloor. Is it not true that there are\naround 5,000 M living in Georgia?\n>> Yes, that is correct.\n>> One further question.\n>> Yes.\n>> Is it not true that the children of\nthese heroes are important members of\nthe Georgia community because they are\nnow doctors, teachers, engineers, and\nlaw enforcement in this state.\n>> Absolutely. is uh the the M people are a\ntestament to um grit, determination,\nhard work, and what can happen uh when\nthey do the right thing. And they've uh\nthis I I would point out this is the\nonly benefit that the VA provides for\nthis community. So, it's certainly again\nthe least we can do here in Georgia.\n>> Thank you.\nRepresentative Lynn Smith up the center\naisle is recognized for a question.\n>> Thank you, gentlemen. I do.\n>> So I join with all the members of the\nhouse to thank you for this initiative.\nAs the wife of a Vietnam vet, I doubly\nappreciate this effort. Thank you.\n>> Thank you, chair lady.\n>> Representing Sandra Scott\nto your right is recognized for\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Uh uh do you\nill?\n>> I do.\n>> I would just like to say thank you for\nbringing this bill forward. Um, as the\nothers had said, it's never too late to\ndo the right thing. And I would just\nlike to say thank you.\n>> Well, thank you to my fellow veteran.\nIt's veterans helping veterans and\nappreciate the committee for all their\nhard work.\n>> Gentleman has no further questions.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the\nwell.\n>> Gentleman has yielded the will. We have\na speaker on the bill in favor of the\nbill and that's Representative Patty\nStinson. Representative Stinson is\nrecognized to speak to the bill, House\nBill 985.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I\nrise to today in support of this measure\nand to offer a perspective shaped not\nonly by my role as a state\nrepresentative, but also by my 20 years\nof experience serving Georgia families\nas a funeral home owner. Often families\ncome to me in moments of grief. And when\nthe loved ones they are laying to rest\nis a veteran, that responsibility\ncarries an even deeper weight. Our state\nveteran cemeteries are sacred grounds.\nThere are places where Georgia expressed\nits gratitude, not in words, but in the\nfinal honors we extend to those who\nserved. We all know that families does\nnot always we we all know that life does\nnot always fit neatly into statutory\nboxes. Records sometimes get lost.\nService histories are complicated.\nFamilies may not have every document in\nhand, especially when they are grieving.\nThis bill allows the board to exercise\ncompassion and common sense, ensuring\nthat technicalities do not overshadow a\nlifetime of service. This bill also\nallows the Department of Veteran\nServices to set reasonable burial fees.\nAs someone who works directly with\nfamilies navigating funeral expenses, I\nknow how important transparency and\npredictability are.\nThis allows\nuh the department to align fees with\nfederal allowances or set an appropriate\namount based on operational needs. And\nwhile the revenue goes to the general\nfund, it still supports the state's\nability to maintain these cemeteries\nwith dignity they deserve. Colleagues,\nHouse Bill 985 is about people. It's\nabout the widow who wants her husband's\nservice honored even though one document\nis missing. It's about the family\nseeking clarity in the midst of loss.\nIt's about ensuring that Georgia's\nveteran cemeteries remain a place of\nhonor, a place of integrity, and a place\nof respect. As someone who has stood\nbeside countless families at their most\nvulnerable moments, I can tell you this\nbill will help do exactly that. And with\nthat, colleagues, I respectfully\nask your favorable consideration for\nHouse Bill 985. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.\nI now yield the well.\n>> Thank you, Representative. The lady has\nyielded the well. That completes our\ncomments on House Bill 985.\nIs there any objection to the previous\nquestion being ordered? Hearing none,\nthe previous question is ordered. Is\nthere any objection to agreeing to the\nreport of the committee which was\nfavorable to the passage of the bill?\nHearing none, the report of the\ncommittee is agreed to. Shall this bill\nnow pass? All in favor of the passage of\nthe bill, we'll vote yes. All those\nopposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk,\nwill you unlock the machine?\nHave all members voted?\nAll members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk,\nwill you lock the machine\non the passage of House Bill 985?\nThe yays are 173, the nays are zero.\nThis bill hadn't received the requisite\nconstitutional majority. Is therefore\npassed.\nGentlemen, I can't add to what we've\njust discussed here, but I can only say\nthank you for your service.\nThank you for your dedication to your\nfellow man. And God bless you all. Thank\nyou for being here.\nMr. Cler, will you read the caption to\nHouse Bill 973?\n>> House Bill 973 by Burns to the 159,\nJones of the 47th, to the 104th, and\nHatchet of the 155th to be titled an act\nto amend an act making and providing\nappropriations for the state fiscal year\nbeginning July 1st, 2025 and ending June\n30th, 2026 known as the General\nAppropriations Act.\nthis bill and refer to the committee on\nappropriations. That committee\nrecommends that this bill do pass by\ncommittee substitute.\nThank you, Mr. Clerk. Ladies and\ngentlemen of this house, the chair\nresolves the house into a committee of\nthe whole house for the purpose of\nconsidering House Bill 973,\nthe supplemental appropriations bill.\nThe chair appoints the gentleman of the\n104th\nhouse district majority leader majority\nleader illstration\nas chairman to preside over the\ncommittee of the whole house. Leader\nEstration.\nAll right. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The\nchair recognizes the gentleman from the\n155th district, Chairman Hatchet, to\npresent the bill.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. Is this Is the mic\non? Anybody know the mic's on? Can y'all\nhear it?\n>> Your mic is on.\n>> I didn't get as many laughs as I thought\nI might. Oh well. So much for humor.\nGood morning.\nSince I've held this position as your\nappropriations chair,\nbudget discussions have been dominated\nby our our significant surplus.\nA variety of economic factors resulted\nin Georgia having an historically full\nbank account.\nWe filled our revenue shortfall reserve\nin 2021\nand we've had excess undesated reserves.\nOn top of that, more recently,\nrevenue collections have slowed to a\nmore modest growth and we've\nappropriated a large portion of these re\nreserves already.\nThat said, we continue to sit in a very\nfortunate position.\nI can't count the number of ways that\nhave been suggested\nwe spend this surplus,\nbut I can tell you we've always acted\nconservatively and judiciously.\nWe've always balanced giving money back\nto taxpayers with making needed\ninvestments in our state.\nWe've never paid for ongoing expenses\nwith one-time money, and we've always\nworked hard to maintain a structurally\nbalanced budget.\nThose of you who've served in this house\nfor some time may remember when the\namended budget was a little sleepy\naffair with limited changes and\nadjustments.\nMore recently, our amended budgets have\nbeen filled with activity as we find\none-time uses for this surplus.\nSpending these funds in the amended\nbudget ensures these projects are not\nadded to our ongoing budget base,\nkeeping our general appropriations\nclean.\nSo, as you all know,\nI have this crystal ball\nand I foresee a future where the amended\nbudget goes on a GLP1.\nBut for now, we still have some\ndecisions and investments to make.\nHouse Bill 973, the amended fiscal year\n2026 budget is set by a revised revenue\nestimate of 42.3 billion.\nIn addition to the revenue growth, the\ngovernor's revenue estimate for the\namended FY26 budget includes $3.3\nbillion in undesated surplus funds for a\ntotal revenue adjustment of $4.5 billion\nor an 11.9%\nincrease over the original FY26 budget.\nYou all know that we in the general\nassembly are responsible stewards of\ntaxpayers dollars. We spend wisely and\nwhen there's extra, we give it back.\nSince 2021, we've given back 9.7 billion\ndollars to taxpayers through rebates,\ntax cuts, and other measures.\nWe'll continue that tradition by giving\nback even more money through this\nbudget.\nWhile the governor's budget\nrecommendation recognized funds to\nprovide income tax rebates, our amended\nfiscal year 26 budget reallocates these\nfunds to provide property tax relief for\nGeorgia's homeowners, funding $850\nmillion for the homeowner tax relief\ngrant program.\nThis grant will reduce next year's tax\nbills for homeowners, and we will\ncontinue to work to eliminate property\ntaxes on your home.\nWe'll address income taxes through House\nBill 1001, bringing our rate to 4.9%,\nkeeping Georgia one of the most\naffordable states to live and raise a\nfamily.\nBefore I discuss some of the details in\nour line items, allow me to begin by\nhighlighting some of the key investments\nwe're making.\nOur budget has two statewide items that\nyou'll see over and over nearly in every\nprogram.\nThe first recurring item is a one-time\nsalary supplement of $2,000 to full-time\nregular state employees\nand school personnel, including preK\nthrough 12 teachers, nurses, nutrition\nworkers, custodians, and bus drivers.\nThese supplements will help us retain\nessential staff and teachers.\nThe second recurring item is related to\nthe state health benefit plan. SHPBP\ncurrently has a healthy reserve fund\nbalance which the governor recognized in\nfiscal year 27 by reducing how much\nstate agencies pay per employee per\nmonth for health coverage starting in\nJuly.\nOur fiscical year 26 budget passes these\nsavings on to the state agencies a month\nearlier. starting in June, saving $21.5\nmillion.\nRunning a growing state is not cheap,\nand this budget spends over $300 million\nin workload adjustments, including K\nthrough2, Medicaid, corrections, health\ncontracts, and DHS out of home care.\nThese additions are largely associated\nwith our growing population.\nSince 2024, we've used $4.1 billion in\nsurplus revenues to fund capital\nprojects with cash, saving taxpayers\nover $3 billion in debt payments. The\nHouse amended 26 budget also makes a\nsignificant $82 million cash investment\nin capital projects.\nIn addition to funding most of the\ngovernor's recommended projects, the\nHouse budget also funds a few noteworthy\nadditional projects. We provided $220\nmillion for a private prison expansion.\nWhile the new Washington County facility\nwill bring muchneeded safety upgrades to\nthe correctional system, it does not add\nadditional bed space, and we're\nprojected to run out of bed space by\n2029.\nThis private prison expansion will\nprovide us an additional 480 beds for a\nsystem that is rapidly approaching\ncapacity. This expansion will give the\nstate flexibility and it can be\naccomplished quickly and affordably.\nThe House's vision\nalso provides $ 29.8 8 million to\ndesign, construct, and equip a building\nthat will house the brand new College of\nOptometry at Georgia's Southern\nUniversity, filling a tremendous need\nfor our state.\nGeorgia has long sent aspiring\noptometrists to study in Alabama and\nTennessee.\nIn hindsight, we should have done this\nyears ago.\nNobody got it.\nOur budget also provides $27 million to\nbegin design and construction of a new\nGeorgia Regional Hospital to address\nmental health and forensic bed capacity\nin our state. We're projected to have\nzero forensic beds by 2034.\nAnd this funding is a down payment on a\nhospital that will help address this\nneed by adding 200 forensic beds and 100\nmental health beds. These examples\nrepresent just a few of our priorities.\nSince you've now had time to read this\nbudget in its entirety, I'll help you\nprepare for your test by highlighting a\nfew items from each of our major policy\nareas.\nTo help keep Georgia mobile, our budget\nmakes several investments in\ntransportation.\nI'm sure you've heard of the big ticket\nitems like 1.7 billion for the I75\nexpress lane expansion, $200 million for\nthe state route 316 interchange\nconversions, and these important\nprojects are in our budget. We also\nprovide significant additional funds for\nall modes of transportation. We\nappropriate an additional $15 million\nfor airport aid. These dollars have a\nsignificant federal match and our\nairports keep economic development in\nour communities flying high. We've\nagreed to the governor's request of $250\nmillion for local transportation\ninfrastructure and we're providing $85\nmillion for rural bridge rehab and\nincreasing $und00 million for local road\nresurfacing projects. We've also\ncommitted $4.2 million in improvements\nto keep the trains chugging along our\nstate-owned short road shortline rail\nlines\nto help keep Georgia educated. This\nbudget continues to meet our obligations\nin K12 and higher education. fully\nfunding our formulas and projections for\nQBE charter systems, promise and special\nneeds scholarships, AP exams, dual\nenrollment completion schools, and hope\nscholarships and grants. We're taking\ncare of our existing facilities with $88\nmillion for major repair and rehab\nprojects at USG and TCSG.\nAnd finally, we include $300 million to\nprovide state matching funds for an\nendowment to provide needs-based\nscholarships.\nTo help keep Georgia healthy, we're\ninvesting $4.8 million for a grant\nprogram aimed at establishing new new\nrural medical and dental clinics. We\nfunded $3 million for nursing home\nquality incentive payments at skilled\nnursing facilities and $17.8 8 million\nto provide graduate medical education\nexpansion.\nWe also provide funds for rural\ncolarctal screenings and we direct the\ndepartment of public health to develop a\nstrategy to promote awareness and\nprevention measures for colarctal and\nprostate cancer.\nOur budget adds additional funds to out\nofome care.\nOur budget fully funds the deficit in\ndefects and we reinstate foster care\nsupportive service contracts\nto help ensure accountability in that\nsystem. We also provide $15 million for\nan integrated child welfare reporting\nsystem that will help enable early\ndetection and speed up service. This\nsystem is up and running and already\nproviding results in six counties in our\nstate. So, we want to make it statewide\nto help keep Georgia safe. This budget\nmakes several investments in the\nDepartment of Corrections to improve our\naging prison infrastructure.\nWe provide more than $185 million for\ncapital projects to make needed safety,\nsecurity, and technology upgrades.\nWe also provide additional funds for new\ncorrectional officer positions\nto improve our officer to inmate ratio.\nand we add significant funds to rising\nhealth, food, and farm costs.\nWe've also included $4 and a half\nmillion dollars in one-time funds\nfor dovest domestic violence shelters\nand sexual assault centers for their\noperational and facility needs.\nTo help keep Georgia growing, this\nbudget provides $35 million to the\nGeorgia Environmental Finance Authority\nto establish a state financing and\nassistant program for natural gas\ninfrastructure needed for economic\nsorry for natural gas infrastructure\nimprovements and an additional $50\nmillion in rural infrastructure needed\nfor economic development. We also\nsupport the governor's recommendation of\n$50 million for the state housing trust\nfund. These funds will help address\nhomelessness through matching funds to\nlocal governments and nonprofits, and\nthey bring with them an up to 4:1 match,\nmaximizing the impact of our state\ndollars\nto help take care of our state retirees.\nOur budget includes $50 million for the\nEmployees Retirement System of Georgia\nto strategically invest in increasing\nthe funded ratio to improve the\nlong-term financial viability of the\npension system and support state\nretirees.\nThese items are just some of the\nhighlights of this 42.3 billion budget.\nWe've turned this budget around just\nthree weeks after it was initially\nintroduced by our governor.\nA task is not possible without the hard\nwork and late nights from our\nsubcommittee chairs and the staff of the\nHouse Budget and Research Office. Let's\nacknowledge how much work these people\non this front row do for us.\nIn fact, we've worked on this so hard,\nwe have made the Senate's job much\neasier.\nThey should be able to just agree and\nsend it right back.\nSeriously, thank you to all the members\nof the committee and to those that work\nfor work with us to get it done. I ask\nfor your favorable consideration of\nHB973.\nAnd with that, Mr. Chair, I'll be glad\nto take a few questions.\nChairman, do you yield for questions?\n>> Yes. Uh, chair recognizes Representative\nSantos for a question.\n>> Does the enemy may yield?\n>> Yes.\n>> Thank you for your hard work to everyone\nthat was involved. I Isn't it true that\nthe 1.7 billion is going to relieve\ncongestion in Henry County, Georgia, and\nwe're all very excited about that?\n>> I think we all hope and pray that that\nhappens.\nThank you.\n>> Thank you.\n>> Chair recognizes Representative Barry\nfor a question.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank\ngentlemen to you.\n>> Yes.\n>> Thank you again for your hard work of\nthis budget. Um I see the increase of\n$200,000 for prostate cancer research\nfor Clark University and the great\npartnership that they do with the\nGeorgia Medical College. What other\nspecific investments are going to all of\nGeorgia's H eight H.B.CU in this budget?\nSo that's an additional funding for a\ngrant that's already out there. So it\nwould make the total of that research\ngrant $500,000.\nAnd there are, you know, H.B.CU are\nincluded\nin, you know, if they're getting other\ngrants through\nother, you know, we nothing has changed\nthere, I guess I'll say. And I don't\nknow specific so I don't know that that\nexact if if\n>> well thank you again. Obviously there's\na lot more we can do. I look forward to\nworking with you on everything from HBC\nsecurity to hope scholarship for HBCU.\nThank you so much.\n>> Chair recognizes Representative Bernau\nfor a question.\n>> Thank you. Does a gentleman yield?\n>> Yes, ma'am. I did ask you this earlier,\nbut I want to make sure that we clarify\nthat the money for the uh schools, you\ndid say it was for custodians, but also\nfor our maintenance departments. If you\ncan check make sure that\n>> I I can verify that, but I'm pretty sure\nmost any employees that are working in\nour school systems are receiving this.\nWe've we've gone back and asked lots of\nquestions about that. the nutrition\nworkers. It's had been asked earlier and\nthey are as a group it's over $28\nmillion additional just for the\nnutrition workers.\n>> Thank you.\n>> Mr. Chairman, do you yield for further\nquestions?\n>> Yes, sir.\n>> Chair recognizes Representative Campbell\nfor a question.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman, uh for your\nhard work and for the entire staff. Um I\nasked this question earlier but um I am\ninterested to know does this budget\ninclude incremental funding for the\ndepartment of early care and learning\nspecifically to expand CAPS funding\nbecause as we all know right now we only\nhave funding to cover 15% of the\neligible families.\nSo this particular budget does not\ninclude any increases for that but all\nthat usually takes place in the base\nbudget and it is in so it will be in\nplay in the 27 budget.\n>> Mr. Chairman, you have no further\nquestions.\n>> Ladies and gentlemen, appreciate your\nfavorable consideration and thank you.\nAs the chairman returns to his seat, I\nknow uh we have a big football game this\nweekend, but I think it's safe to say\nthe MVPs of the House of Representatives\nare the U House Budget and Research\nOffice led by Christine uh Kaki.
