There's a reason she's got a\nBulldog face mask on. So our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the\ngentleman from the 168th Health District Representative, Al Williams,\nRepresentative Williams.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker, and good morning and good morning to my colleagues. And\nand I know some of you will be shocked\nthat I'll say this, but this is the best day of my life.\nWhy is it now?\nBecause this is the day the Lord has made.\nLet us rejoice and be glad in it.\nI am really honored this morning\nto bring our chapter to the day.\nGo long ways back with her husband's family\nand it's just good to have her here\nto share with us this morning.\nAnd I was thinking, as we were sitting,\nI know that she comes prepared.\nI know the Lord called her.\nShe's from Macintosh County.\nThere was an embedded elotr reference now\nwhich she lives in a better district,\n168 in Liberty County.\nNow, we also know that she drove late last night\nShe drove late last night to get here.\nFor those of you who have not made the trip,\nanywhere you come, Representative, Mr. Jordan Lita,\nis 250 miles.\nAs the birds decrow flies, the donkey walks,\nor the car drives, is 250.\nMinister Erica LeCounc comes to us this morning,\nhaving been born in McIntosh County,\nbut I told Representative Hugo this morning\nthat Liberty County men are known for the ingenuity\nand the intellect, so her husband, Richard Jr.\ncrossed the county line and scooped their best\nand brought her back to Liberty County.\nAnd here she is.\nShe has three children.\nShe works for coastal electric,\nthe customer service representative.\nAnd all of us like to talk about, we know great coaches.\nOf course, they have a profound impact upon our lives.\nCertainly, two coaches had a profound effect upon our son's life,\nwho has become the legendary Richard the Count,\ndefensive back for the goals, the University of Georgia, coached by Kirby\nsmart but in high school coach Warner, coached him down to Liberty County High.\nAnd I told him, folks this morning, this is the second time.\nFirst time I asked Richard to come, he had just completed being on state\nState Championship team from Liberty County High and Basketball.\nWhen he finished early, and was admitted to the University of Georgia in January, and\nthey wouldn't let him come.\nThis time, he's laughing, he's in camp, in Fort Lauderdale, I believe it is.\nAnd we worked as excited about coming, and they wouldn't let him come.\nIn April at the NFL Draft, Richard will decide when he comes in the future.\nWe're looking forward to that.\nBut the parts you don't know about great coaches is Richard's first coach, as a person that\nput him on the right road, and minister Erika Lackout was his first coach.\nI've heard how, as a boy, he'd be working about, he'd be ready to go in, no, no, no,\nwe're going to stay a little while longer.\nShe cussed him in basketball and she cussed him in football.\nBut most of all, she taught him to love and fear the Lord.\nSo he's a man of great character.\nSo I'm extremely pleased to present to you this morning from our churches in Darien,\nGeorgia, and you know our mixed temperaments, you know I'd forget the name of the church.\nbattle of truth, church. I know the pastor passed on the wood. So let us hear her as she speaks\nto us this morning. Minister Lacan. Good morning. Good morning to the House of Representative\ninto all who gathered here today.\nI would like to say thank you to the speaker of this house,\nMr. David Rauston.\nRauston.\nFor the invitation and the special thank you\nto my state representative, my state representative,\nMr. Al Williams, for welcoming me, yes.\nAnd to thank you, and I want to also say thank you to my Lord\nand Savior, Jesus Christ, for a 40-meters opportunity to come\nbefore you wonderful people this morning.\nIt is a privilege and honor to come before you for the purpose\nof this devotion and prayer.\nThank you so much for having me.\nAgain, I am Eric at the count.\nBut most people know me as Richard LaCount III,\nthe University of Georgia, Bulldogs, number two mom.\nAnd that's OK.\nI love that.\nWhen he learned of the invitation for me to come here,\nRichard really wanted to be here with us.\nAnd like Senator, I mean, Representative Al Wem said\nthat he couldn't, they wouldn't allow it.\nand that's okay, maybe one day he'll make it back here on his own.\nAfter April.\nI'm pleased to tell you that he is healthy for everyone who is thinking.\nHow is he doing? He is doing fine. Richard is well.\nI'm not just telling you that, but he is well.\nHe's healthy, he's fit, and he's training for his very first job interview.\nWoo, which, by the way, is coming really soon, so remember him in your press, please.\nAnd to each of you here today, I want you to know that, that even though you may not\nhear it very much, we appreciate you.\nI came all the way from Riceboro, Georgia, drove all night last night, and I want to make\nsure I say that.\nThank you. We appreciate you. Thank you so much. We see your hard work. We hear your voices.\nWe are very grateful that even in the midst of the pandemic and racial\ninquilities, equalities, job losses and political divisions, you all stayed the course.\nAnd that, I want to say thank you.\nThank you again.\nAnd that echoes your voice.\nYour voice is the power that the state, our great state, is looking and waiting on.\nWe thank you for that.\nThank you for not wavering and doubting.\nThank you for your patience for sitting in here day in and day out.\nThe book of Philippians 4 and 13 says,\nI can do all things through Christ.\nWho strengthens me?\nThis very scripture have gotten me\nand my family through many, many hard times.\nI'm sure you all as well.\nAnd right now, as our nation in this great state\nof Georgia struggle and face adversity,\nwe must put our trust in our savior\nand believe that he will take care of us.\nHe will, and he will help us in every situation.\nAgain, I echo these words to you.\nIndeed, we can do all things, not some,\nbut all things through Christ.\nHe's the one who strengthened us.\nI decree in the Clown this day, February the 10th of 2021,\nour great nations shall be strengthened\nin the name of Jesus, our Lord and Savior.\nI decree second Chronicles, seven and 14.\nIf my people which are called by my name,\nshall humble themselves.\nYeah, and pray and seek that faith\nand turn from their wicked ways,\nthen our Lord, he will hear from heaven\nand he will heal our land.\nGlory to God, glory to God.\nDespite a tough 2020 for all of us, I knew it was for me.\nAs we began our 2021 year, we can still dream and listen to the voice of God that echoes\nin our spirit's daily.\nIf I may tell you a short story about Richard, he had many and I went through lots, lots\nlots and lots through my memory being trying to think of one that would be fitting for\nthe day. And I came up with this one that he's a dreamer and he had a dream to play at\nthe University of Georgia. And as a young child, he discussed details with other adults\nand many people that knew him in an unusual way.\nIt was kind of weird sometimes hearing him talk about football\nwhen he's four or five years old,\ntalking about the details as a little boy.\nBut my husband and I were amazed.\nIt had no idea what was going on and where did he get that knowledge?\nAnd that level of knowledge from.\nSo one day, we watched him study and film sitting\nin front of computer at five years old,\nrewinding the computer back in four, back in four.\nAnd I just happened to ask him, what are you doing?\nHe didn't say he was dreaming.\nHe responded to me that I'm watching film.\nI'm just watching.\nHe was looking at Hurt your Walker and Tony Dorset and Dion\nSanders and people who names, he couldn't even spell\nsome of the names.\nI had to go in and type the names and pull the videos up.\nAnd I got to tell you all what happened after that.\nOf course, when it was game day at our little community\ndirect department, this kid who sat there for hours\nin front of the computer, he went directly out of my van\nonto the field and did exactly what he saw and what he researched.\nAnd of course, he snatched the football out of many children's hands\nand ran it back for touchdowns, which led the chaos.\nCould you imagine what the rest was thinking?\nWhat are we going to do with this five-year-old?\nBut we see what happened when you dream at that level.\nAnd when you finally reach your dream, it is so important.\nimportant, it is so important for us not to lose our dream and for us to remember that\nwe have so many people behind us watching us, watching you, people who are literally\nthinking about how do I get here one day, how do I get to the place where you are, encourage\nother people in our community daily, encourage our children, they don't just like sports,\nA little witty thing is, rich at love.\nThis is one of his dreams being here.\nAnd you heard Representative Al said twice.\nHe wanted to be here and couldn't make it.\nSo we pray that the third time would be the charm.\nGlory to God.\nGlory to God.\nBut I want to leave two things with you.\nThere are two words.\nThe two words that I wanted to leave with you today,\nwe must remember the dream and the definition of a dream\nthat I like was to have a series of thoughts,\nimages and sensations occurring in a person's mind.\nAs leaders, we all have a responsibility to dream\nand to help others accomplish their dreams.\nRather, as our colleagues or our family,\nand especially our children and our community,\nThe other thought is an echo.\nI had a dream months ago.\nIt was sometime last year that I was standing\ninside a circular room similar to this.\nI thought that I was at the University of Georgia\nwhere sometimes I periodically let prayer for the parents.\nBut it is clear to me today where I was.\nI know today where I was and what I was doing in that dream today.\nI'm standing before you for my community and my co-workers and my family to tell you\nall.\nThank you for such a wonderful job.\nThank you for standing up and representing our state.\nIn the midst of everything, you are still standing and you are fighting for us.\nThank you all.\nI couldn't remember the words that I said in that dream, but I do remember standing\nhere and saying thank you. I'm reminded of the description Romans 10 and 17 it says so faith\ncome by hearing and hearing by the Word of God we must remember that our very words are echo\nwhen we speak our words go out in the universe it goes out and it comes back.\nWe have to be very careful. We must remember that our very words one day. It's going to come back to us rather\nwe are here or in our homes or in the various places. Be careful what we say. Our words are echoing back to us faster than we can\neven imagine. And we will be held accountable to every word that we say proverbs 18 and 21 says\nlife and death are in the power of our tongues. I would like to say Psalms 19 and 14 says let the\nwords of our mouth and the meditations of my heart be acceptable and pleasing in your sight,\nO Lord, my strength and my Redeemer. At this time, I ask that you stand and join me in prayer.\nFather, we just bless your name on today, God. We give your name the glory and all the honor.\nLord, we thank you for this day. We know this is the day that you have made. Everything that's\nin this room, Lord God. You already know about it on this day.\nLord, we ask you right now that you will give us more clarity,\nfocus and understanding. Lord God on what to say, how to say it,\nand witness it. Father, we thank you right now, Lord God,\nfor giving us an opportunity to repent, Lord God, for anything\nwe did or may have said that was not pleasing to you, Lord God,\nwe ask you right now in this time in this space that you will\ngive us, Lord God, that our prayers will not be hindered, that we'll be able to be\nmoving forward and doing the things that you call each and each individually person to\ndo. Lord, we thank you and we glorify your name. We give your name to glory and all the\nhonor in this house, Lord God, in your Son Jesus name, we pray, amen. Amen.\nI pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which\nwould you stand?\nOne nation.\nOn the top.\nIn the visible.\nIn just the\nPro.\nThank you,\nThank you.\nI wish you\nThank you.\nThank you.\nYes,\nI have to put them in.\nDoorkeepers will, please open the doors.\nYou\nYou\nYou\nThe Chair recognizes Chairman Hogan, the Chair of the Committee on Information and\nAudits.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nYour Committee on Information and Audits has read the journal of the previous legislative\nday and found it to be correct.\nFurthermore, Mr. Speaker, when the debate is lost,\nSlander becomes a tool of the losers,\nSocrates.\nChairman Hogan, the chair of the Committee\non Information and Audits Reports,\nthat the journal of the previous legislative day\nhas been read and found to be correct.\nIs there any objection to the confirmation of the journal?\nThe chair here is none in the journal is confirmed.\nThe clerk will read the resolution establishing\nthe order of business for the day.\nMr. Burns, on 59, whose following\nwill be established as the order of business\nduring the first part of the period,\nunanimous consent and reduction of bills and resolutions,\nfirst reading and reference of house bills and resolutions,\nsecond reading of bills and resolutions,\nreports of standing committees,\nfirst reading and reference of senate bills and resolutions,\nmorning orders.\nIs there any objection to the adoption of the resolution\nestablishing the order of business for the day.\nThe chair here's none and the resolution is adopted.\nFirst reading of bills and resolutions, the clerk will read.\nHouse Bill 359 by Representative Williamson,\nthe 115th black man in 146,\nKelly, the 16th Martin of the 49th in action,\n150th Bill B.

Four.\nNow we have two members that on day 15 of their first session\nwill attempt to pass a bill.\nSo I had a dilemma.\nWhich of the two will be the first freshman to get a bill?\nSo last night, I did a very scientific method.\nWe flipped a coin, and the winner was Representative Leveritt, who will now be recognized to present\nHouse Bill 97.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nLadies and gentlemen, the House is my pleasure today to present you a bill that will deliver\nblessings of liberty, prosperity, and almighty God\nuntil the citizens of Georgia.\nAnd it will do so by making technical revisions\nto Title 9 of Title 15 of the Georgia Code.\nThe bill does three things.\nIt requires the chief clerk of a probate court\nto take an oath.\nIt sets out the text of the oath, and it\nrequires that the oath be recorded\nupon the minutes of the court.\nThe reason for this is because the deputy clerk\ncan be in the line of succession if the probate judge\nwere to untimely pass away during office.\nAnd so this is a way of establishing\nwho the identity of that person,\nand yes, it apparently has been an issue in one or two counties.\nAnd so the probate judges council requested this change.\nThe speaker will yield the welfare questions.\nWell, I sure hope so.\nYou must not have explained the bill very well.\nThat's just bored looks like.\njust keep popping.

I do, sir.\nMaybe I want to get it.\nOn line 42 it says all laws and parts of laws in conflict with this act are repealed.\nI know you were never asking one of this body to vote for a piece of legislation we didn't understand.\nCould you explain to us what laws and parts of laws in conflict with this act are being repealed today?\nYes sir, I believe the existing law is being repealed and replaced with this one.\nThat's the extent of my knowledge.\nI hope you're right.\nDo you further yield?\nI do, Mr. Speaker.\nChair recognizes, oh, you got bipartisan concerns out there.\nRepresentative Bentley to your left for a question.\nThis will be good.\nThat's a gentleman yield.\nI yield, ma'am.\nIs it not true that I am the chair lady\nof the funeral home caucus and the strawberry queen\nof this House of Representatives?\nI have no doubt of that, ma'am.\nDoes the gentleman further yield?\nI do yield.\nCan you explain how House Bill 97 is going to impact\nthe funeral home business?\nYes, ma'am, I believe not at all.\nBut it will make it easy for people\nwho are trying to probate wills when the judge dies.\nWill it help the funeral directors get our death certificate\nat a timely matter so we can get paid by the insurance\ncompanies. As I'm assuming that is a matter of great concern to the lady, yes.\nWell, with that being said, I will vote for your bill. Thank you, sir.\nGod bless you, ma'am.\nYou want more? Not particularly Mr. Speaker, but I don't know what the\ncustom is. I don't want to appear too eager to get out of the well.\nMr. Speaker, to quote the great words of the Poet Laureate,\nPorta Wagner, I've enjoyed about as much of this as I can stand.\nI ask for your favorable support of House Bill 97.\nA man that knows Porta Wagner's got a great future in this house.\nIs there any objection to the previous question being ordered?\nThe chair here is none.\nthe previous question is ordered, is there any objection to agreeing to the report of\nthe committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill?\nThe chair here is none.\nThe report of the committee is agreed to.\nShall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye,\nthose opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machine.\nRepresentative Lever to someone covering your machine, your vote, I will give you specific\npermission to have somebody vote your machine.\nWhat's your position on this bill, are you for it or against it?\nThey would vote Representative Leveritt's machine green.\nAll right, you're covered.\nHave all members voted?\nHave all members voted?\nIf so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 97.\nThe eyes are 172, the nays or zero.\nThis bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed.\nClerk will read the caption to House Bill 134.\nHouse Bill 134 by resident of Anderson, the 10th and others to be entitled to amend chapter 14 and\ntotal 50, the fiscal to Georgia and it's had a relay in open and public meetings, so\nas to exclude meetings relating to cyber security, contracting and planning from open meeting\nrequirements, this bill ever referred to the Committee on Judiciary, that committee\nrecommends that this bill do pass.\nSo the runner up freshmen will be out recognized here in a moment, but I have to tell you\nwhen you lost that coin toss. I've never seen a look of devastation on anyone's face like that before I mean I hurt my heart.\nChair recognizes representative Anderson to present the bill.\nThank you Mr. Speaker. I am truly honored and humbled to stand before this body today to present this bill.\nand I have been told that it is appropriate and timely for me\nto make this statement, this is a simple bill.\nThis simple bill will protect the lives, livelihoods,\nof all Georgians.\nAnd with that, I'll present to you House Bill 134.\nThis is a bill to allow governmental agencies that are subject\nto open meetings, open records, to discuss cyber security\ncontracting and planning in closed session and\nexhilarated documents from open records requirements.\nThe other piece of advice I'd gotten was be brief.\nSo with that, Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the well for questions.\nWhat do you have a few?\nChair recognizes representative Ridley to your right for a question?\nDoes the gentleman yield?\nI do.\nSo in this bill, it talks about exemption of meetings\nfrom public inspections and all kinds of good stuff.\nIs that going to hurt any of the meetings\nthat we have in our office in afternoons?\nThank you for that question.\nAnd the answer is no because the walls are thin.\nThose meetings are open to the public,\nregardless of where you're at in the hall or next door.\nChair recognizes Chairman Martin to your left\nfor a question.\nJim McNeil for a question I do you're gonna have some fun with our colleagues a little bit down the road here\nBut I do have a serious question isn't that true. I thank you for bringing the bill\nI think we both served in local government\nIsn't it true you and I have talked and the one concern I have is about too much\nNegotiation towards pricing and spending of dollars going on in these meetings more than would\nnecessarily have to to keep it sacred and you\nHave affirmed to me. You don't believe that's the case\nbut you're going to continue to look at that because we always want to watch the taxpayer's dollars\nBut isn't it true that we want to do that by keeping them safe and keeping these plans\nThe plans themselves out of the public eye\nBut the awarding of the contract not so much. That is correct, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for the question\nthe\nVerbit actual verbiage in the bill itself says no vote in executive session to enter into cybersecurity contract\nwill be binding on any agency until a subsequent vote is taken in open meeting where the identity\nof the contractor and the terms of the agreement are not subject to paragraph 25 of subsection\nA of code section 50-18-72 are disclosed before the vote. So the terms of the contract as\nfar as the dollar amount and the timing of the contract will be disclosed following\nin that vote, or as a part of that vote,\nbut not the potential identification of deficiencies\nand vulnerabilities.\nDo you feel for one more?\nYes, sir.\nChair recognizes Chairman Dubnick,\nto your left for a question.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nAs a gentleman, you know, I do.\nRepresentative, do you have the bill in front of you?\nI do, yes, sir.\nIf you'll turn your attention to around line 49 and 50,\nYou talk in the bill that the identity of the contractor in the terms of the agreement\nthat are not subject to paragraph 25 of subsection A of code section 50-18-72.\nCould you brief this House on what is involved and who's not subject to paragraph 25 of subsection\nof code section 50-18-72.\nOkay, the answer to the question is everyone.\nEveryone is not subject to that except for specific plans and discussions and related\ndocuments surrounding security, security plans and security protocols.\nGentlemen, further yield?\nYes.\nCan you quote those lines for me out of that particular section that I'm referring to\nthat's in your bill. I cannot at this moment I did provide a copy of that to another colleague\nof ours the other day that I had in my file and I have not requested in my file so no\nsir I cannot. Final questions gentlemen further yield. Yes sir. So you and one other member of\nthis distinguished body have that information but you know there's another 178 of us that are\ntrying to make a policy decision here.
