  "transcript": "under the protection of house bille 428\nevery georgean D faces the challenges\nthe challenge of infertility will have\naccess to IVF which has made it possible\nfor thousands of families to realize\ntheir dream of\nperood Speaker John Burns TS the passing\nof HB 428 a bill that will ensure that\nGeorgia families have access to IVF and\nthe opportunity to become proud parents\ngood evening on day 24 of the Georgia\nlegislative session welcome to lawmakers\nI'm Donna Lowry in Atlanta more on the\nlong day in the house with votes on a\nlot of major bills today including IVF\nin a moment also two perspectives on a\nhotly debated bill to help Georgia deal\nwith a shortage in\nanesthesiologists and what is the\nnation's largest legis of Black Caucus\ninterested in accomplishing this session\nand Beyond two of the leaders join the\nshow plus the latest on a bill to\nterminate the social media accounts of\nanyone in Georgia younger than 14 years\nold now let's get a rundown of the day\nat the capital from correspondant Sarah\nCallas Donna an hours long debate over a\nfamiliar issue in the house and unity\nover one particular bill for families a\nbusy day in the house as members took up\nnine bills\nHouse Bill 428 a much anticipated bill\nthat would give Georgians the right to\naccess IVF treatment for the bill\nsponsor the issue is personal a growing\nconcern became apparent that we were\nhaving there was issues so we started to\ntry IVF and we did that multiple times\nwe did the hormone therapy that came\nwith it we even actually uh we tried uh\nadoption at one point and we came along\nall the way down to the end of that we\nwere the last two weeks of adopting and\nhad the attorney the contracts all that\nstuff that goes with it um the process\nthat went with it and that fell apart\ntwo weeks before we were able able to\nadopt so you can say that this\nexperience for us has been a very\nemotional one it's been highs and lows\nit's been a very emotional uh experience\nthroughout this time but I'm here to\ntell you today that we did it we did IVF\none other time and it worked and now my\nwife is pregnant with a little girl and\nwe're we're ecstatic about it Franklin's\nwife joined him in the chamber to\nsupport the bill HB 428 passed\nunanimously the house also voted on\ntheir version of a controversial bill\nthat would ban transgender girls from\ngirl Sports require changing rooms and\nbathrooms to be separated by sex\nassigned at Birth supporters of the bill\nsaid it ensures fairness House Bill 267\nis a common sense bill that recognizes\nthe biological differences between male\nand female\nmen generally have higher cardiovascular\ncapacity greater bone density and more\nmuscle\nmass these advantages are\nundeniable allowing biological males to\ncompete against biological females\ncreates significant harm and undermines\nthe intent and success of Title 9 there\nis genetic differences between boys and\ngirls and that's that's inalienable\nthere and it is not changeable you\ncannot change it no chemical nor home no\nhormone no surgery is ever going to\nchange your genetic makeup\never there's been a lot of people that\nhave talked about that I'm not going to\ngo into detail about it but I also talk\nabout about Progressive left and in this\nconversation we always have about safe\nspaces my daughter deserves a safe space\nshe deserves it but Democrats opposed\nthe bill and said female athletes face\nother pressing issues like sexual\nharassment men telling girls and women\nthat y'all have helpfully diagn the\nproblem for us and now you're going to\nswoop in and fix it with all due respect\ngirls and wh women don't need men\nspeaking for us we do that for\nourselves which brings me to this bill\nwhich again has nothing to do with the\nissues standing in the way of fairness\nfor us in sports if it did it would\naddress real issues not madeup\nones yes these are children\nI said children who are the subject of\nthis\nlegislation the objective being a law\nthat would question their\nHumanity segregate them from their\nclassmates and make them the object of\nridicule at the direction of the state\nthe bill passed 102 to 54 in a Partyline\nvote after a heated\ndebate the Senate voted today on the\nsecond portion of Governor bran Camp's\ntort reform bills when 69 was presented\non the floor the bill would put\nsafeguards around the use of third party\nlitigation funding or tpf tplf companies\ncommonly bankroll plaintiffs to take\ntheir case to civil court in exchange\nfor abortion sometimes a large portion\nof any award that may result this is a\nconsumer protection measure and it also\ncombats the growing foreign influence in\nour own Judiciary this bill in no way is\naimed at removing the ability of\nplaintiffs to engage in this type\nlitigation financing it is purely\nensuring that when plaintiffs many of\nwhich are victims of wrongdoing are not\ntaken advantage of by Bad actors who\nattempt to exploit the tragedy of others\nthe bill would also prevent foreign\nactors who are increasingly behind many\nof the tplf businesses from operating in\nGeorgia one of the things that has\nbrought this to our attention and but\nhas made this to be something of a very\ncritical nature is that it has been\nexposed that many of the third-party\nlitigation financiers are foreign\nadversaries to this country communist\nChina Russia and others and you may\nthink other than the incredible returns\nthat some of these investment\nInvestments produced why would they be\ngetting involved and the reason is it\ngives them a foothold into our civil\njustice system that could give them\naccess to information that they\notherwise wouldn't be able to have think\ndata think technology think things like\nthat unlike last week's more contentious\ntort Reform Bill sp68 which was passed\nalong party lines s sp69 passed\nunanimously another cemp supported bill\nwas also brought to the Senate today but\nthis time it was supported by Georgia\nfirst lady\nMarty sp42 would change the laws\nsurrounding the human trafficking of\nminors which can overlap with the\noffense of keeping a place of\nprostitution this overlapping sometimes\nallows traffickers to receive more\nlenient sentences because of loopholes\nin the law at least two courts in\nGeorgia have indicated that the conduct\nprohibited by Georgia's human\ntrafficking statute is substantially\nsimilar to the conduct prohibited by the\noffense of keeping a place of\nprostitution pimping and pandering in\nregard to minor victims uh this bill\nshould clear that up the bill passed\nunanimously as\nwell tomorrow join me under the gold\ndome for legislative day 25 we're all\nopening you the latest legislative news\nin my Capital report Donna thank you\nSarah the Journal of Medicine surgery\nand public health says Georgia is facing\na short a shortage of anesthesiologists\nthat is complicating the ability of\nhospitals to meet the demand the number\nof those Physicians practicing in\nGeorgia has increased from 783 in 2000\nto\n1147 in 2020 when compared to the\nchanges in the population during the\nsame years the rate of anesthesia\nbiology Physicians per 100,000 people\nhas also increased slightly from 9.6 in\n2000 to 10.7 in 2020 because that growth\nis not sufficient for demand there's\nlegislation in the Georgia house to\nallow a certified registered anesthesis\nor CRNA to order and administer\nanesthesia the house regulated\nIndustries committee had a two-day\nhearing on House Bill 251 it is\nsponsored by Republican representative\nLaura McDonald III of coming and\nstrongly opposed by physician and\nDemocratic representative Michelle Al of\nJohn's Creek who is an anesthesiologist\nI spoke to each of them earlier today I\nhad representative Al explain the\ndifference between a physician anesthesi\nanesthesiologist and a\nCRNA so a CRNA is a certified registered\nnurse anesthetist and as a physician\nanesthesiologist I work with many many\ncrnas as valuable experienced parts of\nour anesthesia care team right now what\nthis bill proposes is to change the\nnature of supervisory practice under\nwhich CRNA is currently work okay so\ncurrently in Georgia crnas can\nadminister anesthesia to patients right\nand they can administer anesthesia to\npatients even without a physician\nanesthesiologist physically present\nthere right however how Georgia law is\nwritten is that they are working under\nthe supervision of a physician which\nusually in the case of if there is not a\nphysician anesthesiologist means they're\nworking under the supervision of a\nsurgeon or an interventionalist for\nexample someone doing a colonoscopy a\ngastroenterologist that type of thing it\nwas brought before our committee last\nyear and and I was very intrigued by\nbecause I am from rural Georgia I grew\nup in Commerce Georgia and so after the\nmeeting I I talked to the the people\nthat were representing the CNAs and and\nI said you know it did not make it\nacross uh the Finish Line last year but\nI was very interested in helping them\nthis year and uh so they we worked in\nduring the off season learning more\nabout what the the role of the\ncoordination that we wanted between\ndoctors and crnas and and we pushed\nforward got it to commit what this bill\naims to do is to carve out the physician\nsupervision from that peroperative team\nmodel right this is a dangerous bill in\nthe following sense physician Le care\nteams are the gold standard of patient\nsafety right so the same way that I\nwould never propose to write a bill that\ncarves crnas a very valuable part of our\ncare team out of having responsibility\nfor that patient I find it shocking\nfrankly that anyone would float a bill\nthat aims to carve physician supervision\nout of that care team in terms of the\nrural areas give me some statistics what\nwe're looking at Donna is there are 27\nuh rural hospitals in state of Georgia\nwithout an\nanesthesiologist there are 80 counties\nwithout an anesthesiologist I grew up in\nCommerce Georgia we had a small hospital\nas I was growing up uh it died on a vine\nit died you know because it just could\nnot doctors did not want to move to\nCommerce we had our local internal type\nmedicine doctors but to get those\nspecialist doctors that you know deal\nwith ob obstetrics or minor surgeries\nthey just didn't want to move to\nCommerce so this this bill would allow\ndoctors to coordinate surgeons to\ncoordinate using a CRNA in surgery\ngetting the using the DEA license of the\ndoctor or of the hospital all the all\nthis bill also allowed hospitals to opt\nout it the policy the hospital could say\nwe're not going to use this method of\nproviding anesthesia but but it but the\nbill also gave hospitals in rural\nGeorgia the opportunity to provide it to\nhelp hospitals be able to survive I've\nheard that argument before that it\nincreases access to care and let me\nexplain why that doesn't make sense for\nanesthesia Services okay\nanesthesia is always a paired service\nand what that means is that we provide\nanesthesia care in service of a second\ntype of of medical care which usually is\na surgery or an intervention or a\nprocedure right we don't just do\nanesthesia on its own it's always a\npaired service right so you could pump\n2,000 anesthesia providers into a rural\nhealthare system but that doesn't\nincrease access to care unless you also\nhave that incompetent raise in having\nsurgeons come and do surgery or\ngastroenterologist coming to do\ncolonoscopies right um so it's it's a a\nfaulty ARG\nthat prays on people not fully\nunderstanding the practice model of\nanesthesia right um I will note again\nthat currently under Georgia law crnas\ncan practice independently of having a\nphysician anesthesiologist there so that\nargument that oh there's not enough\nphysician anesthesiologists in the rural\nareas that's why we need this bill um\ndoesn't make any sense because at\npresent if the CRNA want they can\nalready go to these rural areas and\npractice without a physician\nanesthesiologist\nhowever what is currently in law is that\nwhen they go to these rural areas they\nare practicing under the supervision of\nany physician right this bill aims to\ncarve that supervision out right and I\nthink it's it's really quite poor form\nto write into code right into law that\nPhysicians should take less\nresponsibility for their patients that's\nnot what doctors want and that's just\npoor medicine you know I want to get\nrule George has got to to come up here\nand support us I mean they've got to say\nhey we need you we need a build like\nthis these rural hospitals we had the\nGeorgia Hospital Association supporting\nus and we had pedmont supporting us so\nthere Grady was supporting us so it was\nuh they had an appetite but they too got\nto choose whether they were going to use\nthis program but they supported having\nthat option and that's what this bill\ndid it gives the hospital this kind I\nwant to you you call it the opt out if\nthey wanted to use crnas to provide this\ntype of anesthesia and next year what do\nyou think you'll bring it back I would\nlike to I want to work with it during\nthe off seon and and uh I'm I'm still I\nstill want to help roal Georgia I think\nthat there is a shortage in healthcare\nworkers in Georgia across the board\nright and we're not just talking about\nuh peroperative services like anesthesia\nand surgery and interventions right\nwe're talking about primary care we're\ntalking about OBGYN Pediatrics we talk\nabout this all down the line right so\nthose factors that lead both crnas and\nPhysicians to not go practice and rural\nareas are really outside the scope of\nthis bill right so if we want to really\nget serious about drawing more medical\nprofessionals to served under served\nareas in specific we're going to need to\nlook at the whole Healthcare ecosystem\npart of that is um we're talking about\nnow is the legal environment around the\npractice of medicine and part of it is\nthe fact that Georgia has um one of the\nhighest uninsured rates in the nation\nright and we see that often times\ndoctors in training or people are\nchoosing where they want want to\npractice choose not to practice in um\nthese types of States because it's very\ndifficult to take care of patients who\nhave a very high uninsurance rate right\nit creates a poor PA mix it makes it hos\nhard for hospitals to stay open there\nare a lot of factors within these\ndecisions for people to es skew practice\nin rural areas that is far outside of\nthe scope of this bill what do you want\npeople who are in listening to know more\npeople who are potential patients well I\nwant them to know that all anesthesia\nproviders are very valuable parts of\nthat patient care team but that is the\nessential word that I want people to\nfocus on that it is a team right and the\ngold standard of patient care and\npatient safety is the physician Le team\nmodel so that patients can have access\nto the full complement of training if\nand when a case becomes an emergency\nright we don't always know when we're\nstarting a surgery if a case is going to\nbe an emergency or urgent case or not\nright sometimes cases start out quite\nstandard and then we get into trouble\nand we need that higher level of right I\nwant every patient to have that\navailability of care regardless of what\nkind of surgery they're having and\nregardless of where they\nlive now in the end HB 251 never made it\nout of committee so it will not make it\nto the house floor for a vote but as you\nheard representative McDonald is looking\nto introduce it again in the future and\nI want to thank both representative\nMcDonald and representative Al for\ntalking with me today well coming up a\ngroup dedicated to the health education\nJustice and economic prosperity of

charged with keeping\nthese stories\nalive welcome back to lawmakers I'm\nDonna Lowry one way that groups with\nsimilar interest seek to achieve policy\ngoals in Georgia is through caucuses\ntonight we're going to focus on the\npriorities of the Georgia legis of Black\nCaucus with 75 members it's the largest\nstate black caucus in the nation and\njoining me are two of the officers first\ngbc's chair Democratic senator Nikki\nMerritt of Grayson her committees\ninclude government oversight Health and\nHuman Service and urban Affairs and\ngbc's vice chair Democratic\nrepresentative Doran Carter of lionia\nher committees include Agriculture and\nconsumer affairs education and Small\nBusiness Development welcome to both of\nyou thanks so much for here you guys\nhave been busy today you had a press\nconference it was\nbusy yes you had a press conference so\nlet let's start with that you had a\npress conference today to talk about\nyour priorities talk talk about what\nthose those priorities are well first\nthank you Donna for having us on and uh\nthe Georgia legislative Black Caucus has\nreally committed to our community and so\nour top priorities are Health housing\neducation wealth Public Safety and\nJustice Reform and so we laid out the\nchair woman laid out the agenda today\ndoing a press conference highlighting\nlegislation and priorities in these\nparticular areas that we think are part\nimportant and crucial to our community\nyeah talk a little bit about why why\nthose areas in particular um in almost\nevery poll that I've seen and just\nhearing from our communities that was\nthe feedback we're do we're we're\nhearing housing is almost number one uh\nHealth Care came in at number two uh and\njust things about our economy in general\ncame in but we wanted to really focus on\nthose two top issues as well as we do\nhave one of our priorities about\nBuilding Wealth in the back in the black\ncommunity and that can help with some of\nthe the economic um um problems that\nwe're seeing yeah I know you had your\nheritage Gayla last week was a pretty\npretty big\ndeal so talk a little bit about so you\ntalked about tort reform there and and\nmaternal mortality too right yes at the\nof the Gaya this it was really amazing\nuh we held it at the uh Aquarium\nand uh we had an opportunity to bring\nour members our community leaders our\nsupporters together uh as an opportunity\nto celebrate and we as we talk about our\nheritage and really uh talk about what\nwe're doing for our future and so yes\ntort reform is a part of an issue that\nwe uh hope that we'll be able to address\nand make an impact on our community as\nit relates to uh our insurance policies\nbecause right now uh we're having a lot\nof chatter on how the insurance\ncompanies and attorneys are going to\nbenefit but we're not having a lot of\nconversations around how it's going to\nsupport our uh constituents because as\nyou know in Georgia we are really seeing\nreally high uh insurance rates and the\npeople need relief so as we continue to\ndebate and work through this language we\nhope at the end of the day it really\nhelps our constituents a lot of it is\ntranslating it to the people who are\nyour constituents right make sure making\nsure they understand understand a lot of\nwhat goes on at the capital it's kind of\ntough to to wrap your mind around right\nright or even those of us who are there\nevery day absolutely in tour reform no\none un understands that term so I just\ntold people just remember this is a big\nhandout it's a big handout to\ncorporations and at the end of the day\nwe should be putting um more we should\nbe asking more of insurance companies\nbecause insurance companies are setting\nthese rates so I need consumers to\nreally understand I know I hear I'm\nhearing from my constituents like hey\nvote for the tor perform I'm like no\nwait a minute here this is really a lot\nmore to this than you think and at the\nend of the day it is my job to have more\nconsumer protection policies and make\nsure I'm protecting my communities yeah\nand I know you want to hear from them I\nwant to get to some other bills that you\nguys have in individually and together\nbut one bill that you have that's gained\na lot of momentum is limiting social\nmedia for anyone under 14 years old HB\n165 corre HB 165 we're calling the\nBanning on the the miners on social\nmedia Bill and it is getting a lot of\ntraction and yes it would ban all\ntogether if you're under 14 to be on\nsocial media if you're 14 and 15 you can\nbe on it with parental consent but what\nthis bill also does is holds social\nmedia companies accountable and creates\nan accountability system and makes the\nsocial media companies liable if they\nhave those miners on without parental\nconsent wow and so I know that a lot of\nparents are probably interested in this\nyeah and what I'm what and my real\nreason behind it is what we're seeing\nthat social media the uh social media\ncompanies have built this model to where\nit's very addictive so we're we're\ncreating addiction number one but it's\nalso impacting their mental health their\ncreativity their sense of play and at a\nvery young age you know that's that's a\ncritical age at 14 I think kids need to\nbe outside playing and reading books I\nknow 14 woo I don't even think I want to\ngo back through those that to that age\nyou have a bill um that has a personal U\nfeeling for you I mean this on a\npersonal note it deals with the heart\nheart it's House Bill 459 the heart\nhealth for all act and so tell us about\nit and and why it's so personal for you\nwell the purpose of this legislation is\nbecause we want uh more education and\nmore information in disadvantaged\ncommunities more minority communities\nbecause we know that the number one\ncause of death in women and black women\nin particular is heart disease so\nStudies have shown that the more that we\nknow about the dis disease the more that\nwe can change our Behavior so if we can\nhave uh our uh Public Health\nadministrators in the communities\nworking with our schools providing uh\ndata and information that will help uh\nblack and brown our members of our\nsociety really understand what the\ndisease is and how we can change our\nBehavior whether it's um exercise or\ndrinking water or food especially is\nreally what we eat and just\nunderstanding how different foods affect\nour bodies so we're hoping if we can\nmove this piece of legislation and we\nget more information to the community\nand more information earlier and it\ntrickles down into the homes that we can\nbegin to save more lives and talk less\nabout how how many people have passed\naway and yes it it has affected me and\nthis is why it's so important\num my grandmother um actually passed\naway in a had a massive Heart Attack One\nFriday evening and then my mother died\nin her sleep from heart complications\nand uh even though um we had this\nhistory in our family I never thought it\nwould be\nme yeah we all yeah we all think that\nand um interestingly enough uh March of\n2015 I actually had an attack on my\nheart and um the doctors were like kind\nof surprised because my cholesterol\nwasn't necessarily high and heart uh\nblood pressure was a little elevated but\nit wasn't what you would have expected\nand so um from that I started learning\nmore and more and then I share with you\nuh that since being elected I've\nactually had a stroke and so um I've\nlearned then having that that there's\nsomething in our lipo protein that uh\nthe doctors are are beginning to\nunderstand that that's a indicator of\nyou could be preexposed to to heart\ndisease so there are studies that I\nparticipate in and so with knowing all\nof this I do everything that I can to\neducate our community so since I've been\nelected I've held the um uh heart\nhealthy lunch at the capital in the\ncommunity every year on that first\nFriday in February and every year we've\ndone it someone said thank you because\nthey were having some issues but they\nmay not have gone to the doctor had they\nnot been exposed to that information\nyou're making a difference it's just a\nit's a changing the way people look at\nthings it is it is we we'll we'll keep\nkeep up with your bill and that so we're\ngoing to switch to you you have some AI\num bills that you're interested in and\nit has to do with surveillance correct\nso uh AI is new is you know I I I know\nwe're hearing you know is everyone's\nusing it but there also some could be\nsome problems with AI so AI is being\nused in two ways and I can condense it\nin the two bills that I'm talking about\none is wage surveillance so Ai and data\nis being used to pull like your\ndemographics and where you live and\ncharge you uh different prices for\ndifferent services for instance ride\nshare depending on where you live or who\nthat driver is the driver can beit the\nAI is saying as using uh his data to\npull the driver that would take the\nlowest fair but also charging the\nconsumer a very high price and that\nprice can change too according to where\nyou live demographics so that's one way\nthe other way AI is being used is by\ncompany and government agencies to\ndiscriminate so we a AI is is not\nsophisticated enough to know the nuances\nof like human behavior so uh using AI in\na way to determine things like Health\nCare to determine things like jobs to\nmake um decisions about disability\ncompanies are using the AI data and\nthey're pulling it and AI is determining\nthat and what this bill does is holds\nthose companies liable because for our\nconstitution you cannot discriminate\nbased on race color sex religion or any\ndisability so so companies need to be\nheld accountable we can't sue AI but we\ncan sue those companies and AI only\nknows what the programmers are telling\nit so if we have a bunch of information\nout there on the internet that is biased\nand we know we have a very bias and we\nhave some\ndiscriminatory um things in our society\nAI is pulling that information so you're\nactually allowing AI to make decisions\nbased on bad data wow so a lot of scary\nthings is scary\non another level but I appreciate you\nboth um doing what you're doing down at\nthe capital to try to get that to go you\nknow to to educate people about it and\nto uh try to protect us in some kind of\nway thank you both for coming in today\nappreciate that and that does it for\nlawmakers tonight and we're off until\nMonday but tune in to Sarah Callas for\nlawmakers she has a capital report at\nthe end of PBS NewsHour right before 700\np.m. tomorrow night in the meantime have\na good night my mini is\nhere bye have a good\nnight you can\nwave she didn't know she was going to be\n[Music]\n[Music]",
