  "transcript": "Good morning. All members, please come to the floor. All members, please come to the floor. The hour of convening having arrived, all members, please come to the floor. All members, please come to the floor. Mr. Clerk, will you ring the bell? We're going, well good morning. Good to see you all. You all, all of you. Hope you had a great weekend. You're feeling better, Representative Williams. You're looking better. Because I've had some of my problems over the weekend, but you are looking better. Glad to see all of you. We're going to have the morning roll call now. All members present. Will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber. Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines? Doors keepers, will you please close the doors and keep them closed? Doors keepers. As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by our chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the lady from the Seventh House District, Representative Chair Lady Linsmith, Representative Smith. Good morning, colleagues. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the House. It is my wonderful privilege today to introduce to you Reverend Chip Gordon, Master of Divinity. After learning about the mission of Cancer Treatment Citizens of America, CTCA, which was the first name you know about New New Georgia, Pastor Chip Gordon, Director of Pastoral Care, was instantly impressed. He knew right away that he wanted to be part of the team since CTCA was purchased by the City of Hope Cancer Center. Reverend Gordon continues to serve patients, their caregivers, and the staff he has been for past 13 years. And now several of you in this room have been to either CTCA or City of Hope. Part of the team is Ray Williams right here, and he is our goat sheep person if we have any needs. Chip earned a Master of Divinity from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas, and the bachelor's degree in speech communication from Auburn University. Throughout his more than 30 years of ministry experience, he has served as youth pastor, senior pastor for various churches in North Carolina, Alabama, and Georgia. Chip served as the North American Mission Board Church Planner, planting the church in the Henry County, in Henry County, Georgia. At the time, one of his, at the time, Henry County was one of the fastest growing counties in the U.S. Passionate about the community, Chip served on the board of directors at Bridging the Gap, a community outreach program providing food and other resources for the people in need. That was so important when the tornado hit our community back in 2020-2021. He has served as an advisor to the New and Youth Council, past board of Directors of the New and Kewanis Club, and the past director of the New and Kewida Board of Realtors. He currently serves on the board for Sacred Journey Hospice Foundation. Chip is very active in sunrise Baptist Church where he served as an elder. Born and raised in Nannon, Chip and his wife, Joelle, attended Auburn University. She is a retired mathematics teacher at Newton High School. Their daughter, Joelle, is married to Chip and they have two daughters. Katie and her husband, Hunter, having her husband, Andrew, and four incredible grandchildren. So it's my great privilege today to introduce you to someone. His whole adult life has been about pastoral care. I call it the Faith, Hope, and Charity. He's able to practice all three of those pastoral chipboard. Thank you. Thank you, Representative Smith and Mr. Speaker. What a joy to be with you all this morning. As I begin, I would like for you to do something. I would like for you to look around at the people near you. Just take a moment to look around. They don't look like you. They don't act like you. They don't talk like you. Or have your background. We are all different. You know, friends, I love the fact that God knit each one of us together. We are fearfully and wonderfully and uniquely made. Now, last week I had a dream about being here. There were many people around and then someone came up to me and told me, we just need to hear about unity. And then I woke up. So that night I decided that I believe that was what the Lord wants me to talk about today. Henry Blackaby said, God speaks through the Bible prayer, circumstances, and the church to reveal Himself His purposes and His ways. Unity and peace are central themes throughout the Bible. We may not always agree with one another, but one thing you can agree on is that you are here to serve the people of this great state and to do what is best for the state of Georgia. We are told in Psalm 133 verse 1 how good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity. Romans 14, 19 tells us, let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace. When you stop to think about it, you are either a peacemaker or a troublemaker. You might want to ask yourself, am I a spoon in a bowl of discontent? Do I stir things up? Friends, peacemaking is not always popular. Unity is not always popular. Some people prefer to fight for what they believe in. In a battle, the hope is in winning, but someone must be the loser. Peace making unity actually produces two winners. Peace making is God's way. The apostle Peter wasn't known as a peacemaking kind of guy. In fact, Peter, when we first meet him, was impulsive, strong-willed. I am sure none of you can relate to that, but Peter had changed and had developed some good qualities the hard way. The Holy Spirit changed Peter. Peter was now a man that God could use. Listen to what we read in 1 Peter 3.8. Finally, all of you, be like-minded, be sympathetic, love one another, be compassionate and humble. Peter lists five characteristics, things that we should strive for in order to maintain peace and have unity. We should be like-minded, being on the same page, having the same goals. It does please the Lord when we have unity. I think you all agree that you are here to serve the people of Georgia. But he also says we should be sympathetic, being responsive to the needs of others. Peter goes on to say, love one another. We must look at others and treat them as brothers and sisters. John 1334 tells us, a new command I give you, love one another as I have loved you. So you must also love one another. Peter says, be compassionate. Everybody needs compassion. We all need compassion. At City of Hope, we show compassion with how we say what we need to say to the patient. But we also show compassion by giving the patients a hug. And if you haven't had a hug this morning, you let me know after this is over and I'll come give you a hug. And then finally, Peter says, be humble. Colossians 312 reminds us, therefore as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, cloth yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience. Friends, this morning, ask yourself, how can I be a peacemaker? How can I help establish unity not just as a representative, but in all areas of my life? Unity and peace do not come about by us just sitting and not putting forth effort. Too often we think of peacemaking as a passive role, simply the absence of conflict. That's not the case. You and I must work at peace. We must strive to have unity. Peter was quoting David in Psalm 34, when he wrote in 1 Peter 3 11, seek peace and pursue it. We are all different. Are you always going to get along and always agree? No. But when we seek to live out these characteristics, Peter shared in 1 Peter 3 8, it will make a difference and bring about unity. Would you please join me as we stand and as I pray for you? Lord, I humbly come before you this morning and ask your guidance on this house. I pray for each lady and man present that you will guide them in all that they do. Protect them, strengthen them, encourage them as they seek to live lives of peace and unity. I pray that they will be like-minded, sympathetic, that they will love one another, that they will be compassionate and humble. Bless them today in Jesus' name. Amen. And now if you will join me in the pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands. One nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. We need that unity. Yes. Thank you, brother Chip. Doorkeepers, you may open the doors. Members, you may join brother Chip in the south any room. South any room and thank you for his message on unity this morning. A great message in a timely one. Thank you again, brother Chip. Thank you. Members, our doctor of the day is brought to us by Representative Park Cannon. Dr. Head is down in the aid station. If you need the doctor services, be sure and join Dr. Head and also thank her for service. Thank you. Thank you, Representative Cannon.

Representative Gamble is going to introduce very fine gentleman, a former member of this house. So, give Representative Gamble your attention. Representative Gamble, morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I appreciate the opportunity to be up here this morning. We have a very distinguished guest with us, the honorable Dr. John Johnny Savage. Born on April 16, 1934, he's about to turn 91 here. He graduated from Emery Denyl School in 1959. He joined the United States Navy Denyl Corps. He was first stationed in Jacksonville. He also has a law degree from Emery. After requesting global assignment, he was stationed aboard the USS Glacier and an icebreaker supporting Operation Deep Freeze. This operation provided logistical support and assisted in research missions and Antarctica. He even has a glacier named after him called the Savage Glacier. Dr. Savage moved to Ebro, Florida in the 1980s after successful career in Georgia politics and dentistry. And he continued to practice dentistry until he was 89 years old and he just retired in 2022. I think that's pretty impressive. He served for three terms in the Georgia House of Representatives. In 1974, he ran for Lieutenant Governor against then, Zell Miller, and has pretty interesting stories about that. When he ran for Lieutenant Governor, he had an important driver named, then David Ralston, who later became Speaker David Ralston, was his driver in that campaign. Dr. Savage has a story captured by this book, Johnny and Jazzbo. It's a true story about his relationship with Otis Jazzbo Eigner, who became the first black male dental hygienist in the United States. His mother was mildred. His sister was Nora and unfortunately he lost a son recently marked that passed away. And of course, we remember Mark today as well. But through his life and dedication to service and leadership in dentistry and the military and politics and his mentorship of so many people, he has made a significant impact. And I'm going to close with this because I know I've run out of time. But he also was the dentist for Speaker Murphy. He was the dentist to Reverend Martin Luther King, senior daddy king.

That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. We're representative Houston Gaines has recognized, she's speak to Senate Bill 193, Representative Gaines. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Senate Bill 193 is a workforce development bill that ensures an opportunity for those age 21 to 40 to go back and earn a high school diploma through technical college system. They were contract with accredited providers and really it's a pay for performance model where these contractors would have to ensure that they actually get their diploma where individuals going through the programs would get their diploma in order for the program to actually get. In that regard, so there's all subject appropriations, happy to answer a question if there is one to speak. Gentlemen has no questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Are you the will? Jim was yielded the will. Is any objections to the previous question being ordered? Here in the previous question is ordered. Is any objection to adopting the committee substitute?

Here in the report of the committee is agreed to. This bill now passed. All in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? Yes. Have all members voted? Yes. Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the passage of Senate bill 193 of the yeas of 159, the nays or two. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate bill 149? Senate bill 149, the definition regarding tuition, equalization grants and private colleges and universities. This bill now includes the committee on higher education. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Day Jovoo, see if you get it right this time. Chairman Gaines has recognized to present Senate bill 149. Representative Houston Gaines. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is another workforce development higher education bill. It deals with our tuition equalization grant program. It encourages, as you all know, Georgia residents to attend eligible private colleges by aiding towards education costs. Currently that's $550 per semester or $367 per quarter. There's currently 32 private colleges that qualify for the TEG program. This bill ensures those rigorous requirements. Stay it allows for newly qualified four-year college institution students to participate in the TEG program. They must remain accredited by SAX level 6, which is the highest level in rigor of accreditation. Mr. Speaker, I'm happy to answer questions. Chairman has no questions. Thank you. I yield the well.

Senate bill 123 by Senator Kennedy, the 18th and others to be entitled in act to amend subpart two. Part one of Article 16 of Chapter 2, Title 20 relating the compulsory attendance. So it's up to date and revised provisions of the states compulsory school attendance laws is bill 11 for the committee on education. That committee recommends this bill do pass. Gentlemen from Gainesville, Chairman Dubnick has recognized to present the bill. Chairman Matt Dubnick. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate it, ladies and gentlemen of the House. Last year our state faced a very unfortunate number that is now reality. The number of students in the 22.6% of our students were chronically absent in our public school system. That's not just a number that represents 380,000 young people who missed at least 10% or more of the school year. The bottom line is education is our key to giving our students the next leg up in life and the first step in achieving that is simply being present. Senate bill 123 defines what chronic absenteeism is within code. And again, as I've referenced, that means that a student has missed 10% or more of the school year. While this is not going to fix chronic absenteeism, this is a step in the right direction. We're stating that if a district as a whole has a rate 10% or higher, they have to have an attendance review team. And if an individual school has a rate of 15% or higher, they also have to have a dedicated review team. Mr. Speaker, that is the bill. This is a bill that passed out of the Education Committee unanimously and on the floor of the Senate unanimously. I ask for this body's favorable consideration. I'm happy to answer any questions. Gentlemen, you owe for a question. Yes, sir. Representative McQueen to your left has recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. That's a gentleman you. Yes, ma'am. Can you talk about the role that the judicial part, the judges have to play in this? Because I know from experience, I've been in several systems where these teams are created and already exist, but they didn't have anything to do with the judges of the area. So, we can talk about that. Sure. Thank you for the question. So, they already have that authority and oversight and other sections of our code. And so, we're simply making that match from a truancy in an absenteeism standpoint where their reference in other places in the code just keeping that consistent. Thank you. Thank you. Gentlemen, you owe for another question? Yes, sir. So, I'd like to ask you a few questions. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Gentlemen, you have one more. One more, Miss Vickner. Reps. And you're Irwin. Chairman Irwin, to your right. Thank you, Miss Vickner. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, sir. Is it not true that in some students' cases, the best spot for them is at the school, not necessarily at their home environment? Yes, sir. Mr. Chairman, I couldn't agree with that statement anymore. We've seen so much over the last five years of how much our students need to be in school, want to be in school and find better outcomes when they are there in school. Follow-up. Please. It didn't we learn from COVID that the best teaching is in-person teaching when the students are there with the teacher? That's absolutely correct, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Vickner, thank you for your attention and the questions this morning. And again, I ask for your favorable consideration of Senate Bill 1-2-3. And gentlemen, has yielded the well? Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here he none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here he none, the report of the committee is agreed to, shall. This bill now pass all in favor of passage of the bill. We'll vote yes, all those opposed. We'll vote no, and this clerk will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? All members voted if so. Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine on the passage of Senate Bill 1-2-3, 1-23, the yeas are 160? The nay is one. This bill haven't received the requisite constitutional majority. Is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate Bill 1-1-2? Senate Bill 1-1-2 by Senator Dixon of the 45th and others to be titled, an act to amend Chapter 1, a title 10 of the EFISH go to George Anontetti relating to selling and other trade practices, so to extend certain protections for consumers relative to warranties of HVAC systems and components of such systems. This bill I refer to the Committee on Agriculture and Consumer Affairs, that committee recommends this bill do pass. Chairman John Corbett is recognized to present the bill. Representative Corbett. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, I bring before you House Senate Bill 1-2-3, this deal is with residential real property only. The bill was brought by the Conditioned Air Association of Georgia, which represents license HVAC contractors and suppliers across Georgia. SB1-2, a mere similar legislation that Florida passed in 2023 and has been viewed positively by consumers and the industry. This legislation does two things. It eliminates the registration requirements for these HVAC warranties to contractors and consumers. These registrations, requirements are unnecessary burdened at extra work, and additionally it often causes confusion on who is responsible for registering these systems. And then secondly, it protects the transferability of these warranties should there be a transfer of property prior to the expiration of the warranty. It follows the equipment and not the individual. This bill passes Senate 55-0. So it's a great consumer protection bill and I would appreciate your favor of support. Mr. Speaker, that's the bill. And I'll stand for questions or you'll the well. The gentleman has a question for your yield, representative Jasmine Clark, to your gentleman yield to the question for Jasmine.\n\nJudge McClaught. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? To the general lady I do. So thank you so much for this bill. I think it is a very common sense customer friendly bill. I guess my question is without the registration, how will the warranty company know that, like who the new homeowners are, and that they are now eligible for protection under this warrant? Well, I'll say it follows the equipment and not the individual. With the serial number on that piece of equipment, that's how they track it. So they know a lot of times, if you sell home, you've got a 10-year warranty on your air conditioner, you've only been there five years, you sell it. You know, they go back and look at the serial number, and that's how they track the equipment. Thank you. Thank you for the question. Mr. Speaker, I yield the well and ask you a favor with consideration. The gentleman had no further questions, and he's yielded the well, is in objection to the previous question being ordered. Here in none, the previous question is ordered. Is any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none, the report of the committee is agreed to. Shout out this bill now, pass. All in favor of the pass to the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no, and Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? Have all members voted if so, the clerk will, one more vote. If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of Senate bill 112, the A's are 166. The NA is one, this bill, haven't seen the requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Resolution 273, House Resolution 273? House Resolution 273 by Representative Hong of the 103rd and others, a resolution designated the city of Inchan, South Korea, as the city of the state of Georgia. Mr. Levin referred to the committee on state properties and community affairs. That committee recommends that this resolution be adopted. The representative Suhong is recognized to present the bill. Repsiting Hong. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The committee was to spend just for a moment. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, HR 273 will designate the city of Inchan in South Korea as a sister city state of Georgia. As many of you know, many companies in South Korea have had good economic relationships here in Georgia. We will be having a, the mega plan and the, the, the mega plan opening tomorrow as well. And many companies have invested in Georgia. And so this is just a appreciation to one of the cities in Korea and recognizing them as a city amongst many cities that are doing business here in Korea, here in Georgia with us. Inchan, just a quick overview. Inchan is the home of Inchan International Airport, which is the busiest and the most advanced airports in the world. And Inchan is recognized for its contribution to global engagement, commerce and cultural exchange. So I would respectfully request everyone to vote favorably and allow us to present this to the city of Inchan. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I yield the well. Ladies, yield to the will. She had no questions. City Vienchan, a big day tomorrow if we cut the ribbon down at the meta plant. And then represent the Franklin district down in Southeast Georgia. Great relationship with the country of South Korea. Many great investments here in our state. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in none the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the resolution? We're not in the report. The committee is agreed to. This resolution now be adopted. All in favor of the adoption of the resolution will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the adoption of House resolution 273, the yeas are 165, the nays are zero. The resolution never see the requisite constitutional majority as therefore adopted. Congratulations. Members, I'm going to add a little spice to the punch. And we're going to take up an agreed. Take up one on the agreed today to a Senate substitute to House Bill 161. Mr. Clerk, you ready? The chairman of the crew is recognized for a motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move that we agree to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 161. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? No 161 to be entitled an act to amend Article 133, Title 35, the EF, George Antietta, relating the general provisions relative to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and to provide for authority to issue subpoenas of electronic communications records for purposes of investigation. Chairman Krueh with recognize to explain the Senate's substitute. Mr. Speaker, colleagues, this is House Bill 161 we had back earlier in this body. This would simply give the GBI the ability to get administrative subpoenas for a few other crimes that they currently don't have that ability for to include swatting and domestic terrorism. The only change is going to be in line 125, that portion where the crime of domestic terrorism is laid out. This was actually a change I made at the suggestion of the Prosecutor of the Attorney's Council a way to clean up some language and so that's something that I agreed with the Prosecutor of the Attorney's Council on to make this change in the Senate so it would work better for prosecution for them. And that's the only change. And I would ask for your favorable consideration on the motion. The gentleman has no questions. As you will, the will on the general's motion that the House agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 161, all those in favor will vote yes, all those opposed will vote no, and Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines? All members voted. All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you like the machine on the gentleman's motion that the House agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 161, the yeas are 150, the nays are 18, and the House has agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 161. Excuse me. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of the Senate bill 42-14? The Senate bill 42 by Senator Hatchett of the 50th of the V. Tottel, lack to amend Code Section 16613. Will the official go to Georgia and Senator relating the penalties for violating Code Section 1669 through 16612, so as to repeal certain penalty provisions for the offensive of the Constitution, keeping a place of Constitution, impandering this bill, having referred to the Committee on Judiciary, non-civil, that committee recommends this bill do pass. Representative Hong is recognized to present the bill, Senate bill 42. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I bring you SB 42 on behalf of the First Lady. Next to the First Lady and the Grace Commission, this will be the 10th human trafficking bill that we will be presenting. There is a legal concept called Rule of Lentity, which essentially says that if you have two statutes that are similar, the judge must sentence based on the more lenient statute. At least two courts in Georgia have indicated that the Georgia human trafficking statute for minors that we passed last year is similar to the PIPPing and PAND during a minor statute, which carries a lesser sentence. So this bill will fix that in order to make sure that we have the more serious and more of a punishment for those that are sex trafficking and human trafficking are minors. What is the bill I ask for your favorable consideration and I yield the well. Thank you. Today. Any questions being ordered? Here in none the previous questions ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass, all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes, all those opposed. We'll vote no, and Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine on the passage of Senate Bill 42, the yeas are 169, the nays are zero. The bill haven't seen the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of Senate Bill 110, 110? Senate Bill 110 by Senator Anit-Avart, the 31st and others to be taught an act to amend code section 15-112. The official code of Georgia and Antietta were laying the definitions, relative to the juvenile code, so it was revised the definition of neglect. And to provide for new definitions, this bill having been referred to the committee on the June and I, Justice, that committee recommends that this bill do pass. You ready, sir? You tell me you're ready all the time, aren't you? Any time, there you go. Chairman Eddie Lomston is recognized to present the bill. Chairman Lomston. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the House. I bring to you today Senate Bill 110. This is a bill that addresses the definition section of our juvenile justice code and has the net effect of making Georgia's open-ended definition of neglect much more specific and fair. It gives Georgia families the right to let their children travel to and from school by walking, running or bicycling to travel to and from nearby commercial or recreational facilities to engage in unsupervised outdoor play and to be a home alone for a reasonable amount of time. It will allow parents to make these family decisions and makes it clear that the parent, not the government, determines when their child is of sufficient maturity, physical condition, and mental ability to avoid substantial risk of physical harm. It clarifies that neglect is the denial of necessary care to a child, which creates an environment that is obviously interest to his or her will fare. This tighten definition of neglect matches the public's understanding that the state should not intervene in family life unless the parent's actions or emissions cause a serious risk of harm to the child that is obvious to a reasonable person. Current law allows authorities to label a parent neglectful based on an officer's own moral judgment and does not require any evidence that the parent is endangering the child's health or safety. This legislation establishes basic rights for Georgia kids and families by declaring that the ordinary activities of childhood are not neglect or child endangerment that parents can make reasonable decisions about when their children are ready to be unsupervised, that neglect means putting a child in serious and obvious danger and that the police cannot charge parents with a crime simply for taking their eyes off their children. It gives parenting decisions back to Georgia parents and childhood back to Georgia children. Mr. Speaker, that's the bill. I would appreciate your favourable consideration. Gentlemen, has a question or two? Yes. Phil Yeild, the ribs of the park, Ken and to your left is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Do you? I do. Thank you. I want to thank you for your advocacy for children. This particularly impacts transgender children and as you said, establishes basic rights for Georgia kids. I'm concerned about section two as it relates to HIV. Can you advise what this language does as it relates to HIV and children in Georgia? This was already code. This is nothing new, nothing in this bill that I see here in section two. Okay, goes over on the second. As you said, as a term independent activity and neglect, I think it speaks for itself as you read it. Further inquiry? Yes. Because my question was not at all answered. Could you try to answer the question? What does line 42, line 48 do? It says it shall not be a violation for custodian to permit a child to engage in one or more independent activities. So what is your question? What does this do? It's easy for me. Can you just extrapolate this as you know? In the next section, the term independent activity, legal custodian and neglect, shall have all the same meetings as provided in the previous code section, which is already there. Gentlemen, you know for another question? Yes. Representative Fry to your left has recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is my friend you? Yes, sir. Now, you know, we came from a time when there was an actual TV commercial and some plate on the radio said it's 10 o'clock at night. Do you know where your children are? Yes, sir. Right there. And how over time that the definition of reasonable can change. And I don't really see where in this bill that it prevents a police officer from charging you with neglect from what they perceive to be a reasonable issue. And so, isn't it true that we were judged differently when we were little than they are today, and that this could potentially provide problems for parents the way it's written in its current form? I think it's written in its current forms. It provides some protections for parents. It makes it clear that it is the parent that gets to determine whether the child has sufficient maturity to engage in these specific activities. Would the gentleman further yield? Yes. Can you point out in the line where it shows that the parents have the right to make that decision in this piece of legislation, please? I might have missed it. And I'm sorry. The specific language, the specific language 18 talks about an independent activity, and it lays out what those independent activities are. Sure, but for the yield. Are you? Can you show me where it does define independent activity, but where in this bill does it say the parents are the ones that choose what those independent activities are, and whether they're reasonable or not? Because I feel like that the reasonable, in it true, that I feel like the word reasonable is still very subjective, and we have new stories of moms getting arrested because their kid was playing down the street. Gentlemen, that's a question. Gentlemen, yield to Wilbur Chet, right in front of you to your right, just recognize for a question. How do you? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does Jim and you? I did. Is it the purpose of this bill and the intent of this bill to bring clarity to this code section? So as a ambiguous provision of neglect cannot be charged of a parent, isn't that true? That is correct. All right, so this is strengthening the parents' rights to allow their kids to go to the grocery store or go to the ball field, and that wouldn't be considered neglect. Is that correct? That is correct. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I yield well. You had a lot of other questions, but you know, gentlemen, as you were at the well, we do have a speaker. Leader, else Stratian has recognized the speak to Senate Bill 110. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, do the questions that were asked. I want to come down here and discuss Senate Bill 110 with you. So this is a very important legislation that's being discussed here today, which really goes to the heart of parents or legal custodians have a responsibility to look after the children that law enforcement may be looking to interpret or implement Georgia law and in doing so. We want to preserve the parents' right to allow the child to have autonomy. When I was growing up, my mom would send me into a store to buy something. I would potentially, you know, walk down the street to go to a friend's house and with what we've seen in particularly in the media with the reporting around this, the concern that rises here is that parental autonomy that allows for a child to develop a sense of independence, the ability to think for themselves to really develop and mature. Sorry for the feedback here, but that that may be subject to interpretation by law enforcement or authorities inconsistent with the parents' rights and responsibilities. So I think that Senate Bill 110 is a measure that thoroughly and thoughtfully revises our state's juvenile code to better reflect the realities of modern parenting and child development. Redefining the definition of an neglect provides clarity for parents and guardians. And that to the distinguished representatives, questions a moment ago, we don't have to restate in the bill that a parent or legal guardian is going to be making these determinations. That's already law. Parents already have rights. So that further language is not necessary. SB also, 110 also amends the reckless conduct statute ensuring that parents are not unjustly penalized for permitting their children to undertake reasonable independent activities. And this alignment promotes a balanced approach, safeguarding kids while respecting parental judgment. So colleagues, I would urge your support of Senate Bill 110 to affirm our commitment to laws that both protect Georgia's children but also our practical and empower parents to make the decisions that they need to raise independent, thoughtful young Georgians to become great future citizens of our state. Mr. Speaker, with that I yield the well. Gentlemen, as you are to the well, there are some questions, but as you are to the well, we have no further speakers. On Senate Bill 110, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Hearing none, the previous questions ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable? The passage to the bill. Hearing none, the report of the committee has agreed to shall. This bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill. Will, yes, all those opposed? Will, no, and Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? All members voted for what purpose represent you, Oliver Rice? Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. State your inquiry. Isn't it true, sir, that this bill arose from an incident in Mineral Brough, Georgia, where a policeman chose to arrest a mother whose child was walking to school. DeFax had no interest in pursuing that case, but the policeman, I think, probably went across the line. But further inquiry, Mr. Speaker, does it really change the definition of neglect and put the words imminent risk of harm into the standard that's going to make it more difficult for case workers to define neglect? Isn't that the real problem of this bill? Sure, the lady has a firm understanding and put the situation just head up and of the language, but I won't comment on what it may do. For what purposes represent Miller Rice? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that parents who are accused of neglect often believe that they have not been neglectful? I'm sure that could be the case. Further question, Mr. Speaker? One more preliminary inquiry. Is it not true that we trust law enforcement officers to make judgments every day on the street in a way that is consistent with their training and judgment? And this bill undermines that fundamental principle for reasons that have not yet clearly been shown on this floor and in the committee process today? I'm sure the lady probably believes that. Have all members now voted if so, Mr. Clerk, were you locked the machine? On the past, you said it bill 110, the Yays are 100, the Nays are 69. The bill, obviously the requisite constitutional majority is there for past. Mr. Clerk, were you read the caption to Senate bill 119? Senate bill 119, was Senator Goodman the eighth and others to be entitled to amend some part one of Part 4 of Article 2, Chapter 2, a title 8 of the fiscal to Georgia annotated relating the general provisions for manufactured or mobile homes. So those are divided limited exceptions to circumstances under which a manufactured home shall become real property. This bill I have been for the Committee on Banks and Banking, that committee recommends this bill do pass. Representative Lebritz recognized to present Senate bill 119, German Lebritz. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, the House Senate bill 119 is identical to House Bill 377, which I sponsored and which passed this House on February 28th this year by vote of 166 to 0. If you require any further explanation, the bill has to do with simplifying the process by which a lender would take a security interest on a manufactured home and provide that if that home is later converted to real estate by the surrendering of the title, the security interest of the lender still is preserved. This is intended to make this area of lending more attractive to lenders and thus hopefully increase the activity in that space and help with workforce housing and other issues that we're having across our state. So we believe this is a good bill. You voted for it one time. I'm asking for you to just do it one more time for me for Senator Goodman and vote green on Senate bill 119. Mr. Speaker, I will be glad to stand for any further questions. Representative Rhonda Taylor to your left has recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The gentleman you? Absolutely, yes, ma'am. Can you share with me how a personal property is converted to real property? Yes, ma'am. That is a process that is somewhat unique to manufactured housing and mobile homes. So generally a mobile home or manufactured home is treated as movable property and because it gets carried on the highways, it gets a certificate of title just like a car. And so if you make a loan on a mobile home when it's in that movable state, just like a car loan, the lender will take possession of the certificate of title and get placed on the title as the lean holder. When you cite a mobile home on a piece of property, you can have the title surrendered, which converts that manufactured home from the legal category of personal property, which is movable tangible property to real property. And then there's different rules that govern how you would convey it, how you would sell it, how you would take it as collateral for a loan. But the process basically involves getting a certificate of permanent location and filing it with the clerk, then taking that and the certificate of title to the tax commissioner and you surrender the certificate. So it's at that point sort of canceled and the home is treated as part of the real estate. Do you further you? Yes ma'am. I'm surprised the lady doesn't regret the questions just for now ready, but I'm glad to continue. Oh, your explanation is absolutely fine. I just want to make sure that we're clear that attaching the real property to the land is what I mean, I'm sorry, attaching the personal property to the land is what's making it become real property. Well, it can, but so you have to do that as part of the process, but surrendering the title is a way to conclusively have the mobile home deed to be real property. There's a lot of factual inquiry if you don't have that surrender of title procedure and that's why it was derived to sort of get a conclusive rule for everybody. Well, the clarity is needed because in one of the areas that I do in the legal field is bankruptcy and declaring this needs to be understood. Yes ma'am. You know what we're talking about. Thank you so much for the question.\n\nThe gentleman has one more question if you will yield. Yes, sir. Representative Al Williams recognized for a question right down front. Thank you for speaking with the gentleman yield. Absolutely, sir. Is it not true that in the process of paying for saying a mobile home that you can have the mobile home for closed on and removed but not lose your property? Is that not so? Yes, sir. That's absolutely correct. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, this is a further question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I ask your favorable consideration of Senate Bill 119. You're the well. Thank you. Good explanation. Thank you. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in the report the committee has agreed to shout this bill now pass. All in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes, all those opposed. We'll vote no, and Mr. Clerk. Will you unlock the machine? The bill is ordered. Have all members voted for what purpose is represented? Petrie rise. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. The State should inquire. Mr. Speaker is not true. This is historic day because as soon as Representative Jason Ridley finds where his home is, he has an opportunity to own a piece of real property. A man is where his heart is and where his home is. And so down about that, congratulations, Representative Ridley. If all members now voted, all members voted this, Mr. Clerk. Will you lock the machine? On the passage of Senate bill 119 to Yays or 168, the Nays are zero. This bill has received a requisite cost of some majority. Is there for a past? We have a couple of agrees and disagrees and some other business, but we have some young people in the gallery. We're going to take a moment and honor them because they've got to get back to getting what they do and ask going back to school. Representative Anissa Jones is recognized for a distinguished group of young people. Representative Jones, give the lady your attention, please. Thank you, Speaker. If there's any members of the making delegation, please come up front with us because we have some of the pride of making Bill County with us here today. And because I am a proud Northeast Raider graduate of 1989, and I'm glad that they are in the people's house today because we are celebrating a milestone for our school. And I still say our cause I'm still a proud Raider. This last past year, and our Raiders had a phenomenal season for football, as well as they went to the state championship for the class A Division I. And hey, yeah, it does deserve some applause. But however, we fell a little short, but that's still not a reason to celebrate because our team had not been to the state championships since the 70s. So I thought it was not robbery to make sure that we honor them and the good work that they did this year as going to the state with this resolution that I have before. But I do want to recognize those that are on the floor with us today. We have making Bill County Schools District Superintendent, Dr. Dan A. Seams. We have the principal of the Northeast High School here today, Dr. Donna Walker Thompson. Our District Athletic Director Kevin Groons is here. Our Athletic Director for Northeases up there with the students, my classmate from B4 Valley State University, Tangy Harnett. We have our head coach, the magnificent Jerry Wiggins that is here, other coaches and attendants, Robert Mays, Quentin Peevy, Trent Allen, Terrence Redman, and none other than their star athlete player, Nick Woodford. Now we're so proud of Nick Woodford because not only is he an athlete, he's a student, a model student of student athlete because he is their valedictorian of their class this year. That is to be commendate. So I want all those young people from B. Northeast High School to stand up and receive your flowers while you are here. And we're going to let you know that we love everything that you are doing to make us great a proud. And with that, I yield the will. Congratulations. Congratulations. Good to have you all in the people's house. Congratulations to the athletes or the kids. Athletics is good to have you all with us. Thank you, Representative Jones. Representative Gerald Green is recognized for a motion, Representative Green. Thank you, Mr Speaker. I move that the House agree to the Senate substitute to House Resolution 97.

I believe it's going to draw a janitor relating the number of judges of the Spirit Courts, so it's a survivor of additional judges and Spirit Courts of the Lapa Ha judicial circuit. Perhaps the report is recognized to explain the Senate substitute to the House Bill 55. I would represent the floor to the Senate. So House Bill 55, which adds a third judge to the Lapa Ha judicial circuit in the Senate, the Senate substitute simply corrects an effective date. I was part of that conversation and I agreed to the amendment that changes that date in Section 2 from July 2026 to January of 2026.
