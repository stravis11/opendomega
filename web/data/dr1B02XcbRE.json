Leverett\nis recognized to present the bill\nrepresentative\nLeverett thank you Mr Speaker ladies and\ngentlemen the house I apologize for\ntaking your time again tonight but this\nis an important measure Senate Bill 12\nis no longer what it originally came to\nus as as chairman Anderson said this is\na house upgrade we have combined into\nSenate Bill 12 we've removed the\noriginal language and place three house\ninitiative initiatives that\noverwhelmingly passed the house last\nyear and this year one was House Bill\n375 which was a bill of mind to deal\nwith when conservators can settle claims\nof their war of of award a person there\nincompetent person there appointed to to\nto look after and to act on behalf of\nHouse Bill 291 was representative\nScoggin bill that would expand the list\nof professions or or medical disciplines\nthat can evaluate someone for a\nconservatorship or a guardianship case\nand the reason for that is is probate\njudges are having a hard time finding\ndoctors to do this and if you've ever\nhad to go through a\nguardianship where it's just it's it's\nemotionally wrenching and anything that\ndrags that out or delays it is just is\nhorrible um you're basically having to\nhave a someone declared incompetent to\nhave a conservative or Guardian\nappointed it it it already is a\nslow-moving process and if there's a\ndelay in finding someone to do an\nevaluation it can be very detrimental\nand then finally we have a house bill\n1264 that is representative Stevens bill\nthat provides for um impaired Health\nCare Professionals um in monitoring and\nRehabilitation have a a professional\nhealthc CARE program for the ones who\nbasically when they're impaired means\nthey may be be going through a a bout of\ndepression or they're having a drug\nissue other medical professions already\nhave these programs where they can\nsurrender their license and then go\nthrough a program to to get better um\nand this we're doing it here for um\nprofessional counsil social workers um\nI'm sorry for\num yes professional counselor social\nworkers marriage and family family\ntherapists and nurses there are other\nprofession that already have this kind\nof program we're just expanding it to\nthose professions as well so we the\nthese are all measures you've previously\nvoted on uh the the worst of them was\n161 to zero the others had more yes\nvotes than that and I ask you just\nreconsider them so we can try to get\nthese done because they are desperately\nneeded for uh probate judges in the\nadministration of justice and for these\nmedical professions Mr Speaker I'll you\nfor any questions well chairman Collins\nis already standing so I think he has a\nquestion gentleman yield to Chairman\nCollins yes Mr Speaker

that\nhelp us deal with the Senate any any way\nit it would cuz I think we need to file\na number of those but uh will'll have to\ntake care of that on a different day but\nthank you for the\nquestion

access to the ballot in Georgia for\nthe presidential\nrace uh it clarifies and further defines\nresidency requirements for voter reg\nregistrations it uh further defines\nvoter registration

a summary\nof the bill and um the hour is getting\nlate and we have a lot of more work to\ndo and so um if there's you have a\ncouple of questions if you'll take them\nI'll take a couple questions uh\nrepresentative Jasmine Clark to your\nleft has\nquestion thank you Mr Speaker does a\ngentleman yield yes ma'am section six of\nthe bill talks about handmark paper\nballots and I'm very curious um which\nCounties have um uh less than 5,000\nregistered electors okay so uh thank you\nfor the question\nand how this will work this may not be\nfor an entire County uh there are some\ncounties with fewer than 5,000 voters\nbut this could be for one County\nCommission seat where they're uh\ndistrict is 5,000 impacts 5,000 or fewer\nvoters and we have situations where um\nwhere that does occur and this is\noptional for the local government to uh\npetition the state election board to use\nthe handmark paper ballots in those\nlimited cases and can I ask a follow-up\nquestion to that yes the current ballot\nscanners that we have that we use in the\nstate that are normally used to read the\nQR codes that we uh use on our ballots\nare those ballots scanners able to read\nthe text or go back and forth because\npresumably we would be using those same\nscanners in larger elections do they\nhave that capability now and if they\ndon't how are counties supposed to pay\nfor the ability to actually use these\nballots are you referring to the optical\ncharacter recognition Okay so uh the\nexact same scans that that are used to\nscan the uh the ballots when we cast our\nvotes those same scans will be used used\nin the optical character recognition um\ntabulation all right um thank you for\nthat thank you you have another question\nand we have some speakers signed up uh\njust for your information uh chairman\nTarvin to your right in the back is\nrecognized for a\nquestion gentleman y yes sir excuse some\nof my questions here I've got about\nthree but I understand it removes the\nSecretary of State as the from the\nelection board that's correct that's\ncorrect well we got some messages that\nmaybe it it compels the investigation of\nthe Secretary of State by name and that\nhe cooperate is there anything in this\nbill that says that so we are this bill\ndoes remove the secretary of state from\nthe election board understand and it\ndoes change the um uh the notification\nrequirements of the board when they uh\nhave a meeting to address emergency rule\nchanges uh the secretary will now be one\nof the parties notified since he will\nnot be a member of the

B\n189 this election bill has uh one bill\nnumber but the truth is it is a lot of\ndifferent election bills put into one\npackage and there are some good bits in\nthis bill and there are some neutral\nbits in this bill and there are some\nreally bad bits in this bill too bad\nparts that are based on lies and\nfear-mongering and that are going to\nstretch our election administrators to\ntheir absolute limits and deny people\ntheir right to\nvote I cannot believe that we are still\nbending over to a common omate election\ndeniers conspiracy theorists and\nunindicted co-conspirators when it comes\nto election\npolicy I can't believe that we are\njustifying sloppy and rushed policy\nchoices by saying we need to bring more\nconfidence to our elections when you\nknow just as well as I do that there's a\nvery vocal minority out there who will\nnever be confident in the process so\nlong as their candidate is not the\nwinner you know the policy of not\nnegotiating with\nterrorists I wish we had a policy of not\ncreating laws to Plate conspiracy\ntheorists and one of the biggest\nconspiracy theories that I have heard\nnot only out there but repeated by\nmembers is that our voter roles aren't\nclean and that we need to challenge\nvoters in order to clean the\nroles because what this bill\ndoes is it makes it easier to challenge\na person's person's eligibility to vote\nand it makes it more likely that voter\nchallenges successfully kick a voter off\nthe\nroles that's what's in section five of\npage eight of this bill and we will hurt\nmore eligible voters than we will help\nwith this\nsection so in opposing s SP 189 today\nI'm going to make three\npoints first I'm going to explain to you\nthat this idea of unclean roles is false\nand intended to justify taking action\nthat is not\njustified second I'm going to show you\nhow Mass voter challenges are being\nweaponized they do not clean the roles\nbut they do hurt both eligible voters\nand election\nadministrators and third I am going to\ntell you that the real motivation behind\nthese making these voter challenges\neasier I'm going to tell you what that\nis so let's start at the top this\nnarrative that we have\n[Applause]\nunclean voter roles is\nfalse did you know that election offices\nare constantly going through voter list\nmaintenance it's required by both\nfederal law and by Georgia law and it\nhelps ensure that only eligible voters\nare voting election offices are always\nadding new registrants on or taking\nineligible voters off election officials\nutilize high quality data from various\nsources including the Georgia Department\nof Public Health the Social Security\ndeath Master file um and the department\nof corrections to cancel records\nbelonging to deceased individuals and\nthose with felony\nconvictions when someone dies there is a\nprocess for removing them from the\nroles when someone moves and registers\nelsewhere there is a process for\nremoving them from the\nroles in odd years election offices go\nthrough a supremely robust list\nmaintenance process where they remove\nvoters from the roles who have been\ninactive for a minimum period of time\nlast year we removed half a million\nvoters from the roles in Georgia and\nthat was without a single voter\nchallenge being\nplaced the list maintenance process that\nalready exists strikes an important\nbalance between taking people off the\nroles when there's actual quality\nevidence that they are no longer active\nor eligible to\nvote and protecting Georgia voters right\nto vote protecting them from being taken\noff the roles are arbitrarily or\nerroneously and that balance is\neverything because again we are talking\nabout someone's fundamental right to\nvote a vote a right that is so precious\nthat people have shed blood for it\npeople have died for\nit and so here the key question is about\nregular list maintenance is it working\nis taking people off the roles on\nregular intervals working\nand the answer is yes there are folks\nhere who want to pretend we have a\nmassive problem with our roles and that\nif there is a name of a dead person on\nthe roles that's a real security\nrisk but set aside the fear-mongering\nand The Logical leaps and the facts\nreveal that actual voter fraud in\nGeorgia is in infintiy\nsmall so the Heritage Foundation\nactually keep keeps track of voter fraud\nand between criminal investigation\ncriminal convictions excuse me judicial\nfindings official findings civil\npenalties and diversion programs they\nhave found that there were 21 instances\nof voter fraud in\nGeorgia since\n1997 let that sink in\nSo In fairness that information may not\nbe completely up to date uh since today\nit was just reported that the first vice\nchair of the Georgia Republican party\nvoted illegally nine times while he was\nunder F felony\nprobation but let's add those nine and\nlet's say there was 30 cases in Georgia\nin 27\nyears with millions of Georgians voting\nin every Statewide\nelection when people say our roles are\nunclean and that that is a problem and\nthat that's going to have a material\neffect on on our elections they're\ntrying to scare you because there's\nsimply no evidence of it and it\nshouldn't dictate our\npolicy plus our election officials are\nalready handling it they're already\nconducting that list maintenance at that\nregular plan interval and to the extent\nthat a challenger finds a person on the\nroles who has died or that has moved\nthat person was going to come off the\nroles anyway with or without that voter\nchallenge so the idea that we need some\nbusy\nJoe Schmo to come out with his own voter\nlist of challenges to the county so that\nthe rols will stay clean that's\ncrazy it has never been about cleaning\nthe rolls it's about causing\nchaos so let me paint a picture for you\nthat's perhaps\nrelatable let's say that we're making\nThanksgiving\ndinner and we're serving 10 dishes\nturkey sides rolls all the pies you've\ngot everything t timed perfectly because\nyour guests are going to be over at 4:\nand you've only got two\novens and then your mother-in-law comes\nover early and she starts telling you\nhow she would do things because she\nthinks that she knows best and she\nprefers that you make the stuffing\noutside of the turkey and she likes to\nmake her rolls with a different kind of\nflow and she insists that you should go\nto the store to pick up the canned\ncranberry sauce and all of a sudden your\nyour food is getting burned you don't\nhave enough space in the oven and you\nrealize you forgot to defrost the\nturkey the process was working it always\nworked it was going to be a delicious\nmeal and then your mother-in-law messed\nit up with all her ideas and that's what\nMass voter challenges are doing with our\nelection offices they're causing chaos\nthey are forcing election offices to\nprocess voters out of order out of\npriority because because some people do\nnot have an understanding of how list\nmaintenance\nworks or maybe they're just pretending\nnot to understand how list maintenance\nworks but hopefully you do understand\nhow it works now so let's move on to the\nsecond Point voter challenges don't do\nanything to clean the roles but they do\nhurt voters and they hurt election\nadministrators last year when I spoke in\nopposition to sb22 to the bill that\nprohibits election offices from seeking\noutside funding I stood up at this Dice\nand I warned this body that the weapon\nabout the weaponization of the voter\nstatute voter challenge statute and I\ntold this body that the challenge\nstatute was no longer being used for its\nintended\npurpose the idea behind voter challenges\nis to allow a person with personal\nknowledge of a voter's inab\nineligibility to flly flag that voter\nfor the county right so example you know\nthat your neighbor has moved to Florida\nto retire they moved a year ago but then\nyou go to your Precinct in Georgia and\nyou see them voting so through the voter\nchallenge statute you can alert your\ncounty office to look into your\nneighbor and to be clear no one takes\nissue with that kind of use of the voter\nchallenge statute but that is not how\nthe voter challenge statute is being\nused\ntoday rather is being weaponized against\nvoters in specific counties against\nelection administrators in specific\ncounties and yes against taxpayers in\nspecific\ncounties which specific counties\ncounties with large numbers of\nDemocrats how is it being\nweaponized Challengers are challenging\nhundreds and sometimes thousands of\nVoters at one time there's no regard for\nindividual\ncircumstances they don't know the people\nthat they are challenging they don't\nknow where they live or what their\nsituation is most of the time they're\nusing a list they have purchased from\nthe national change of address\nregistry and since T oh excuse me since\n2021 we've seen hundreds of thousands of\nvoter challenges flood counties like\nchadam cob decab fet forye Fulton\ngwet Mass challenges\nMass meritless voter challenges and I do\nmean meritless because overwhelmingly\nthese Challengers are not providing\nsufficient evidence to withstand the\nthreshold of kicking someone off the\nvoter\nroles let me give you just one example\nof a meritless challenge exactly one\nyear ago an educated sophisticated voter\nin Fulton County and her entire family\nhad their right to vote\nchallenged they were names on a list of\nmany names that were indiscriminately\nsupplied to the county on a mass\nchallenge form and what made that\nchallenge stand out in particular is\nthat the voter was literally a sitting\nmember of the Fulton County Board of\nElections she was actually the Fulton\nCounty gop's nominee to the\nboard so needless to say that challenge\nwas thrown out and we can all agree that\nthe challenge in that case was\nobjectively a waste of time and a\nmockery of the\nprocess and I want to be clear about\nsomething just because a mass challenge\nisn't successful at kicking voters off\nthe role it doesn't mean it's not\nharmless it is harmful it's not harmful\nit is harmful it's very harmful and\nthat's a feature not a bug for the\npeople who are filing these\nthings so let me explain to you what\nhappens when someone files a mass\nmeritless voter\nchallenge the county receives the voter\nlist the challenge list one two they\nhave to stop the work that they're doing\nwhatever it is preparing ballots\ntraining pole workers checking inventory\nregistering voters they have to stop\nthat work that they are doing by law to\ndeal with the challenges within days of\nreceiving it three they have to notify\nthe challenge voter by May to tell them\nthey have been challenged and that there\nwill be a hearing within 10 days of the\nnotice to determine whether the voter\nwill keep their right to vote four then\nthe staff spends time to prepare for the\nhearing they must research each\nindividual that the individual\nchallenged voter they have to consider\nany evidence the voter submits and then\nthey have to speak with Witnesses they\nhave to reach out to administrators all\nof this takes time and resources away\nfrom them doing their jobs in a system\nthat barely has any time resources or\nwilling Personnel\nleft five then they have to hold the\nhearing these\nhearings separate from their regular\nboard hearings have been known to last\nfor\nhours and six after considering the\nevidence the election board makes a\ndecision on the challenged\nvoters so again regardless of whether\nthe voter has kicked off the roles or\nnot and let me reiterate because most of\nthe time they are not you now have\nscared voters by telling them that they\nare challenged and you have ground\neveryday election administrating\nAdministration functions to a\nhalt we had an opportunity this year to\nfight back against meritless voter\nchallenges we had an opportunity to do\nwhat was right to stand up for a\nhardworking election officials and to\nstand up for voters and the fundamental\nright to vote and what we are doing\ninstead is the opposite with SB 189 we\nare making voter challenges easier to\nbring and easier to\nsustain so that leads me to my third and\nfinal Point why are we passing a bill\nthat will make voter challenges easier\nto bring and easier to sustain what is\nthe real motivation behind this\nprovision have you ever heard of Eagle\nAI unless you're a big election nerd\nlike me I'm guessing probably not but\nyou need to learn about it because it's\na big part of what election deniers and\nconspir theorists it's a big part of why\nthey're supporting this\nbill many of those same folks support\nEagle\nai ai it's a tech company that was found\nright after the 2020 election key\nsupporters include Georgia serial\nregistration Challenger Jason Frasier\nand former president Trump lawyer CA\nMitchell\ndon't Google the company to find its\nwebsite you won't find it they keep a\npretty low profile but they've been\nworking for years on a tool to\nstreamline the voter challenge\nprocess the tool pulls data off the\ninternet which by the way is lowquality\ndata far less reliable from what our\nelection offices\nhave and that data is used during the\nlist maintenance process right so the\ntool will flag a voter because they have\na missing comma in their name or they\nhave an initial instead of a middle name\nit will flag the voter if they're\ndeceased and these are either\ninsignificant issues or there are issues\nthat would have been picked up during\nthe regular Miss list maintenance\nprocess and by using this software with\njust a couple of clicks any amateur\nsleuth can compile a list of mass Mo\nvoter\nchallenges and an email will be\ngenerated with the correct language so\nthat they can send that mass voter\nchallenge right to their election\noffice so it is a scam and it is a\nracket and it's going to cause the\nnumber of voter challenges before the\n2024 election to\nexplode and what are we doing with s SP\n189 we're adding kerosene to that\nfire the eyes of the country will be\nwatching Georgia in the months leading\nup to November are we going to be a\nstate that leads with truth and facts or\nare we going to bow down to lies and\nobstruction don't say that you don't see\nthis coming because it is coming and if\nyou vote Yes to SB 189 you are choosing\nthe grifters over\nGeorgians Mr Speaker I yield the\nwell lady has yielded the\nwell representative ran is recognized to\nspeak to the\nbill\nthank you Mr Speaker colleagues today I\nrise in strong opposition to Senate Bill\n189 my colleague has very succinctly\npresented a lot of the concerns with\nthis bill and I want to stress on some\nof\nthem almost every year we do this almost\nevery year we come to the chamber and\naround this time we rush through a bill\nrelated to voting because it's great for\nelection season but the problem is it is\nterrible for our democracy\nthe reality of the situation is we\ncannot govern by algorithm we cannot\ngovern by what our social media feeds\nare telling us Time After Time After\nTime these bills come forward and we can\nliterally walk to a different part of\nthe building and speak to the\nstakeholders relevant to these\nbills but instead of doing that we're\ninstead choosing to governed by\nalgorithm I don't need to play into the\nstereotypes that all of you have about\nother countries around the world but one\nof the bedrocks of our country is our\nbelief in our electoral\nsystem and election experts have looked\nat billions of ballots studied multiple\nraces and have found no evidence of\nsystemic voter fraud and when there was\nsystemic voter fraud we've caught\nit but we can't keep coming here as\nelected officials people TR trust us\npeople look to us as authoritative\nfigures and when we lean into these\nconspiracies when we lean into this\nrhetoric we are telling people that what\nyou are seeing what some random person\nwho's going to lose nothing tweets out\nis\ntrue the internet is a beautiful thing\nit is an incredible thing it has brought\nus together it has it's exposed us to\nmultiple\nperspectives but the reality situation\nis our job requires us to sift through\nall that noise\nand come to the truth we have access to\nthese stakeholders and we can go talk to\nthem today in our counties in our cities\nand in our\nbuilding and I've come up here before\nand I've explained it to yall we cannot\nkeep mandating these unfunded\nrequirements by our counties this is\nimpacting counties around the entire\nstate it doesn't matter what party it is\nthe professionals who are doing this\nwork the people who are as apolitical as\nyou can get these days are the ones\nbearing the brunt of all of\nthis just so y'all\nknow my voter file was\npurged my voter file was purged if you\nlook me up right now it says the first\ntime I voted was in 2020 and I've got\nthe Selfies to disprove that and the\nreason is that people kept trying to go\nthrough the voter log over and over and\nover again and I got caught in that\nthat's how data sets work the more times\nyou run it the more more likely you are\nto run into\nmistakes and so when we keep enabling\nthese challenges when we keep enabling\nthese people who literally can just send\nout a tweet or write a blog post or post\na podcast or put out a YouTube video and\ninstead of going you know what I hear\nwhat this person is saying let me go do\nthe hard work of verifying whether or\nnot what they're saying is\ntrue instead we go I'm going to lean\ninto that and I'm just going to do what\neveryone's telling me to do\nwe have a responsibility to push back on\nlies not turn them into\nlegislation I'm very serious about this\nelection Integrity is so important but\nwhat we don't realize is by continuing\nto lean into election Integrity this way\nwe are actually eroding election\nIntegrity when you keep telling people\nthat our voter roles are wrong that our\nmachines are hackable that our elections\naren't secure there there's massive\nvoter fraud instead of doing the thing\nthat we've done for centuries which is\nthe peaceful transfer of\npower you are enabling forces in our\ncommunities and our country that are\ndangerous and\nfundamentally a threat to\nus frankly I'm surprised the people who\ncare so much about security continue to\nmake us less secure because once again\nsocial media algorithms have put us in\nbubbles information bubbles\nthat mandate that we take these\npositions we can literally walk to the\nSecretary of State's office and have a\nconversation with them we can literally\nwalk to different parts of our\ngovernment agencies and have\nconversations with them that is our job\nand what this bill does is it tells\npeople no not only have we not been\ndoing our jobs but in fact government is\nfundamentally evil and\ncorrupt sorry y'all we're part of\ngovernment whether you like it or not\nour job is to make this system better\nnot continue to score cheap political\npoints every single year at the expense\nof our democracy and I know this sounds\nhyperbole or whatever the case may be\nbut so far the voter challenges from\nforesight to Gwynette from fton to Decap\nfrom Hall to\nClayton these voter challenges have\ncontinued to be baseless and yet we have\nelection officials wasting precious time\n60 to 70 hour weeks for months just to\nget through these voter challenges you\ndon't think that's precious time\nrequired to prepare for the next set of\nElections to update our systems to clean\nup the voter registration\nroles so we keep enabling this\nincredibly undemocratic\nprocess instead of reminding people that\nthis is what makes who we are as a\nnation\nincredible it's like we've forgotten\nthat it's like we've forgotten one of\nthe most fundamental things that's\nincredible about our\ncountry we have we've been peacefully\ntransitioning power for\ncenturies but you don't think that this\nconstant chipping you know it's like a\ndeath by a Thousand\nCuts that's what these bills do it's a\ndeath by a Thousand Cuts you don't think\nthat's going to have an impact\nyou don't think that plays a part in the\npsyche of our constituents who want to\nbelieve in our Democratic processes but\nthey hear from their elected officials\noh I'm sorry that might not be the\ncase we have got to end this cycle\nenough is\nenough again experts have reviewed\nbillions of ballots over the\nyears there has not been evidence of\nsystemic voter fraud\nbut if we keep doing this and this is\nnot an exaggeration because I I'm I'm\nhearing it from more and more people who\nsay well my elected official said it's\nhappening even when I know that elected\nofficial knows it's not\ntrue even when they've privately told me\nI know this is not\ntrue but our constituents don't know\nthat our constituents aren't in these\nhalls with us where we're kind of like\nyou know I I don't really support this\nbut I'm just going to have to vote for\nit because it's an election year they're\nnot in these halls with us and they are\nhearing what we are saying to them and\nwhat we're signaling to them and I\npromise you if we keep legislating by\nalgorithm I I don't know what that\nfuture is going to look\nlike and so I really urge people to get\nout of this like partisan element of\nwhen it comes to elections I know this\nis politics I know this is how this\nworks but of all the things I really\nthink elections should be the place\nwhere we say enough is\nenough because would sincerely hate\nsincerely hate for us to get to a point\nwhere we can't even hold elections\nanymore without it constantly\nconsistently being a problem and where\nfrankly my biggest concern is that\npeople completely disbelieve in the\nsystem moving forward and it's going to\nbecome harder for us to hold\nelections we've had election workers\nthreatened we have had um voters\nintimidated this has happened all within\nthe past four years we our memories are\nnot that short and so I urge you today\none from a procedural perspective this\nbill doesn't work but from the\nperspective of protecting our\ndemocracy right and our peaceful\ntransfer of power we cannot keep doing\nthis we owe it to our constituents to\nsift between what's right from wrong and\nnot governed by algorithm thank you Mr\nSpeaker I yield the\nwell ladies yield of the well represent\npark Canon you have about three a little\nover three minutes remaining on the\ntime thank you Mr Speaker members I rise\nin concern about lines 94 through 96\nwhich apparently were added to this\nmeasure which address those who do not\nhave a permanent home as to where they\nregister to vote let's be clear Georgia\nhas strict voter ID laws so for\nindividuals who are unhoused it's\nalready\ndifficult enough for them to prove who\nthey are many times they have an expired\nlicense and rely on a voter ID card that\nwe're not even able to use in order to\nvote I ask why do we even call it a\nvoter ID card if you can't use it as ID\nto\nvote secondly Georgia has no homeless\nvoting rights statute if it really has\nno Provisions that protect those who are\nhomeless in general that's why the\nNational Coalition for the homeless NCH\ncreated the you don't need a home to\nvote\ncampaign as of now in Georgia you could\nlist the address of a place where you\nusually stay or a map or coordinate\nnearby where you feel comfortable and\nthat makes sense because you could be\nunhoused in any part of any\nCounty this bill makes it really\nconfusing because now it says any person\nof this state who is homeless shall put\ntheir permanent address as the\nregistrar's office of the county in\nwhich the person\nresides how does that make sense that\neveryone in Fulton County who is\nunhoused would put the government\nCenter's Address\nit just simply does not make sense I\nrecommend that we look at the National\nLaw Center on homelessness and poverty\nand reclaim that voting is a common\nright even when you are\nunhoused lastly I'll recommend that\neveryone take a look at the film called\nrigged I hosted a film screening of it\nin my district it outlined how one\nindividual did thousands of voter\nchallenges and when he was met with one\nof those individuals whose vote he\nchallenged a military professional who\nhad to go out of state for our state's\nmilitary when he was face face to face\nwith that person and asked would you\napologize for challenging this man's\nright to vote he\nrefused today I think we need to refuse\nto vote to this bill because it allows\nfor the increase of voter challenges and\nit does not make sense for those who are\nunhoused I will be voting no and I\nrecommend that you vote no to this\nmeasure thank you Mr Speaker I yield The\nWell the lady has yielded the well that\ncompletes those opposed to the\nbills representative representative\nAnderson is recognize the speak in favor\nof the\nbill I hope you won't take it but you\nhave up to 30 minutes okay I will not\ntake that Mr chair uh speaker thank you\nfor uh recognizing\nme colleagues as I was sitting there\nlistening to the uh the the previous\nspeakers my uh my discussion in favor of\nthis bill has evolved a little bit my\noriginal intent was to talk only about\nthe sections that were not discussed\nwhich would be the uh like section one\nwhich further separates the powers\nbetween the executive and the\nlegislative branch by removing the\nSecretary of State as an next official\nmember of the board uh and then also to\nDefine how in section two how the the uh\nemergency rules and regulations that\ncome before the board that that because\nof that separation the secretary is\nadded to the list of\nnotification uh as well as other\nProvisions in this bill but hearing the\ndiscussion we just had I wanted to\nactually turn to the bill itself and\nlook at the context and the content of\nwhat the bill has a lot of discussion\nwas had about section five regarding\nchallenges and let's look at section\nfive I'm going to start at line 179\nwhere we start adding uh some language\nto current code line 179 through\n184\ndefines the probable causes that can be\nused for\nchallenges lines\n184\nthrough\n189 actually through 195 excuse me then\ndefines what will cause insufficient\nprobable cause for challenges so I\ncontend that what we have done is we've\ndefined how you can challenge and Define\nthe parameters that those challenges can\nbe found\ninsufficient looking at line 190 through\n192\nany challenge of an elected elector\nwithin 45 days of the Primary runoff\nprimary election uh or runoff election\nshall be postponed until the\ncertification of that primary election\nof run or runoff is completed this\nprevents last minute challenges from\ndelaying elections it prevents last\nminute challenges from causing you as as\na uh uh as a candidate from having to\ndeal with those kind of issues and for\nthe electors having to deal with that\nand then 193 through\n195 any challenge of an elector who is\ndeemed elig eligible pursuant to The\nResidency determination provided for in\nparagraph 810 or 11 of subsection a it\ngoes on and basically that's referencing\nsection four of the bill we just had\nsome discussion about section four\nregarding homeless section four provides\na mechanism for the homeless to actually\nhave the opportunity to vote that has\nbeen left up to local jurisdictions up\nto this point we're defining that in\ncode and then it also goes further to\nDefine how people's residency is\ndetermined and this is something that\ntakes the most amount of time in dealing\nwith challenges how do you determine the\nactual residency of those challenges\ncolleagues I contend that our bill\nactually makes the process of\nchallenging more difficult and it\nactually is designed to clarify clarify\nwhat constitutes a valid challenge\nclarify what constitutes an invalid\nChallenge and with that Mr Speaker I'll\nyield the well and ask for everyone's\nfavorable consideration gentem yield of\nthe well that completes the discussion\non the bill we do have a minority report\nrepresent excuse me is there any\nobjection to the previous question being\nordered chair here's none the previous\nquestion is ordered now we're ready for\nour Minority Report representative Stacy\nEvans is recognized for up to 20\nminutes thank you Mr Speaker and good\nevening colleagues I Rise and opposition\nto Senate Bill 189 just wanted to talk\nabout some of the points we heard from\nthe pro Side Of The Ledger here um the\nfirst thing we heard was okay we heard a\nlot about section five but let's talk\ntalk about the rest of the bill and all\nthese great things that are in the\nBill well I would love to be able to\nvote on all those parts by themselves\nbecause there is good in this bill as\nwas said there were there are neutral\nParts in the bill I'd love would love Mr\nSpeaker if we could vote on those things\nseparately but our house rules don't\nallow us to amend or pull out parts and\ninstead all this was mashed together so\nwe have no choice but to vote on it as a\nwhole considering all of its parts and\nthat includes section\nfive so I wish we could I do agree that\nthere are good parts in this\nbill we heard hey we're we're we're\npreventing these last minute\nchallenges 45 days anything that's done\nwithin 45 days in an election we're\ngoing to we're going to put that to the\nside and you deal with that\nafter I'm not really comforted by that\nfor two\nreasons number one does that mean we\npile all this up and we deal with it\nright after the election and all those\nfolks that wanted to to deny elections\nand find all these reasons why the\nelection is not valid and all these\nvoters um we not qualified we're going\nto spend all that time calling the\nelection into question and less than\nuntil all those voter challenges are\nresolved so that's not very comforting\nto me the other thing is that you know\nif you if you study the election code\nlike probably most of us in here\ndon't there is no systemic list\nmaintenance allowed 90 days before an\nelection by federal law 90 days not 45\ndays and in a state like ours where we\nhave a good early voting period you're\ngetting pretty close anyway so I'm not\ncomforted by\nthat and I'll leave you with\nthis\nwhy ladies and gentlemen I was here once\nbefore and I left for a couple years and\nI came back every year since I've been\nback we have done an election bill we\nhave given new rules new regulations new\nUNF unfunded mandates unfunded mandates\nto our local election boards and said\nyou figure it\nout you figure it out we're not going to\ngive you any more money we're going to\ntry to put limits on who you can even\nhire we wanted to do that today you\nfigure it out\nhow about we wait and see if some of\nthis is working we have we have come\ndown here and passed bills that affect\nelections like I said every year that I\ncan remember and every time we do it the\nproponents of those pieces of\nlegislation come to this well and say\nthis is going to secure our elections we\nare going to have the most secure the\nmost Fair elections that you can ever\nhave and then the next year we have to\ncome back and open up the code again so\nare you lying then or El liing now is it\nnow going to be the most secure or we\ngoing to come back next year and do it\nagain more unfunded mandates for our\nCounty elected officials how about we\nsee and I'll also say this

thank you Mr\nSpeaker um uh this is House Bill 11:05\nwe passed a few weeks ago this is the\nGeorgia Criminal Alien track and Report\nAct of\n2024 uh as most of you remember we uh\nthis bill simply ensures that when\nindividual uals have committed crimes in\nGeorgia and are uh jailed and in custody\nthat uh when we determine they are\nillegally in this country that we fully\nwork with Federal immigration\nauthorities in informing them of their\npresence and in honoring any ice\ndetainers I will speak to the changes\nmade in the Senate and they are as\nfollows uh the bill now uh penalizes\nlocal government leaders who support\nSanctuary policies and violation of that\nprohibition um with a misdemeanor that\nyou'll see in section six it requires\nthe department of audits to review\nimmigration compliance reports that are\nsubmitted by local governments and\nSheriff's offices most of you will be\nsurprised to know that we haven't been\ndoing that they are voluntary compliance\nreports that are required today nobody's\nauditing them we're going to change that\nin this measure now with the Senate\nversion Senate version requires the\ndepartment of corrections to post on its\nwebsite ACC quarterly report of\naggregate data on the number of ice\ndetainers in our state prison uh which\nwould be consistent to the report that\nlocal jails will now be doing on the\nversion you passed a couple of weeks ago\num the Senate version requires that DNA\nshall be collected from convicted felons\nin the Georgia Department of Corrections\nwho are subject to immigration detainers\nthat was an amendment in the Senate and\nthe bill finally uh implores the State\nBoard of Pardons and parols to not\nrelease relase any illegal alien from\nconfinement prior to the completion of\ntheir senates unless they are assured\nthat Federal immigration authorities uh\nwill uh Deport such alien upon release\nuh those are the uh changes made Mr\nSpeaker and I'm glad to accept a\nquestion if you if you if there are some\nthere are a\ncouple I'll accept one Mr Speaker whip\npark right in front of you has a\nquestion whip Park's recognized for a\nquestion thank you Mr Speaker um\nrepresentative Petri I I know that you\nvery much care about this issue yes sir\nbut is it not true that this bill uh\nthat a lot of concerns have been raised\nby law enforcement uh that this bill\nwill undermine their ability to keep\ntheir Community safe by requiring them\nto essentially act as if they were uh\nimmigration law enforcement officers and\nis it not further true that again uh\nthere's a lot of concern in the\ncommunity that uh this bill will\npotentially tear apart families and\ncause a lot more harm uh than uh it may\nbe intended is that not true uh no sir\nthat is not true I appreciate your your\nposition and I respect it very much and\nI appreciate the question I disagree\nwith that fully so uh as it relates to\nlaw enforcement this bill is endorsed\nand supported by the sheriff's\nAssociation in the interest of Public\nSafety I'm glad you reminded me of that\nI needed to say that um what we are\nasking law enforcement to do is with\nthat small subset of people people who\nhave committed crimes in our community\nand are already in the country illegally\nand I would remind you that entering the\ncountry illegally is a civil and\ncriminal laws have been broken by virtue\nof people illegally being the country\nthey subsequently uh commit a crime in\nour\ncommunities working with ice which is\nwhat ice wants us to do uh I don't think\nanyone in law enforcement believes that\nis uh too much to ask but thank you for\nthe good question sir were you for one\nmore uh one more sir is are there U\nProvisions still in this version of the\nbill that would withhold State funds\nfrom law enforcement offices that do not\ncomply if any local body so a a a county\nwho uh has a separate Jail from a\nsheriff a municipality or a sheriff so\nwe're talking about jails we're talking\nabout individuals in custody that refuse\nto follow current law that's been on the\nbooks for 18 years by the way I have to\nremind you that since we didn't discuss\nthat today but from the previous\ndiscussion current law for 18 years if\nthey refuse to honor that law that is\ncorrect they they risk losing State and\nState administered Federal funding that\nis correct sir thank you for your\nquestions thank you Mr Speaker I yield\nthe well the gentleman has yielded the\nwell on the gentleman's motion that the\nhouse agreed to the Senate substitute\nthe house bill

governmental\nentities representative Daniel is\nrecognized to\nexplain the amendment\nthank you Mr Speaker I'll make this\nbrief the hour is late this bill is not\nwhat it originally was the language in\nthis bill is actually the language from\nHouse Bill\n1284 I stripped my own bill because I\nthought it was that important on the\nother side and some friends um if you\nremember at the beginning of session my\ncolleagues and I got up here and we\nrecognized the death of an 8-year-old\nlittle girl in our community and what\nthis bill does is it strengthens the\npenalty for people who pass stop school\nbuses um the Senate did also make an\namendment to clean up some Charter\nSchool language and I ask that this\nhouse agree and her family is up here as\nwell this\nevening I'll take any questions if you\ngot\nthem represenative Parsons to your left\nchairman Parsons is recognized for a\nquestion thank you speaker lady yield I\ndo well isn't it true that in principle\nI agree with much of this actually I\nauthored the original bill that allowed\nfor uh third parties to put the uh um\ncameras on school by stop arms and have\na several penalty for that but are you\nuh line 70 through 73 are you really\ncomfortable with increasing that fine\nand that penalty that much I am so this\nwas something that was discussed pretty\nheavily in committee\nand my answer is although we are\nincreasing this fine the biggest issue\nthat we have is the behavior from the\ndriver it's not the school bus's fault\nit's not any other issue other than\npeople are just continuously doing this\num there's actually a nationwide study\nthat is done every year and in a single\nday over 95,000 instances take place um\nand so it is\nsomething to to give you a short answer\nI actually had it higher than that\noriginally um because the state of\nIndiana has it set at $10,000 and so\nthis was the the lower lower cost all\nright do you further yield I do I\nbelieve 737 70 through 73 actually is\nnot does not refer to the Civil part\nthis actually has to do with if a uh\npolice officer or if the bus driver\nactually reports that and of course a\nbus driver one of the reasons we I even\nuh initiated the bill for the third\nparty to to pay for the uh camera on the\nstop arm is because the bus driver\nreally is too busy driving the driving\nthe bus and protecting the children to\nreally catch these things because he has\nto write it down on a form turn it into\nLa law enforcement with a a a license\nnumber uh different uh different\ninformation about the vehicle many of\nthose would get away in places where\nthey don't have the stop arm camera that\ntakes care of it so many of these are\ngoing to be are not going to be\naddressed anyway and for that to be\nincreased to $1,000 or by confinement\nfor not more than 10 12 months or both\nthat seems very very extreme does it not\nso that's actually so the way that when\nI discuss it with ledge council is that\nthat particular part is not for the\ncamera that is for an actual that is\ncorrect yes that is if a cop sees them\ndo it and do you further yield I'm sorry\nbut I do and on line 79 this does refer\nto the Civil increasing that penalty\nfrom $250 to $1,000 yes well isn't it\ntrue that let's put Let's uh give her\nthe question let's answer it and let's\nmove on okay well I just would just say\nis it not true that there's going to be\na lot of people who are going to be very\nunhappy if we pass this bill and it goes\nto the goes to the governor because\nthese are tremendous increases in this\nand a lot of people have a problem with\nit anyway I've had to defend this thing\nfor the last seven or eight years that I\neven did it but to have these penalties\nincreased this much is going to cause a\nlot of problems and a lot of people be\nvery unhappy with this with this\nlegislation is it not true I will reject\nthat premise a little bit because I do\nbelieve that it is a preventable\nBehavior if people continue to choose to\npass a stop School Bus knowing it is\nagainst the law they should be penalized\naccordingly and believe that this piece\nof legislation does just that thank you\nMr Speaker i y the well if there are no\nother questions on the lady's motion\nthat the house agree to the amendment to\nhouse bill to the agree to the Senate\nsubstitute as amended by the\n[Music]\nhouse oh we are on the L's

purpose is representing Kenard\nrise parliamentary inquiry State inquiry\nisn't it true Mr Speaker that if someone\nan employee or a volunteer is driving a\nvehicle for a nonprofit or a business\nthat the ticket would actually go to the\nbusiness or the nonprofit and not to the\ndriver I'm sure the gentleman probably\nread pretty carefully on that bill for\nwhat purpose does representative\nAlexander\nrise she\nWS for what purpos is representing\nDaniel\nrise Mr Speaker isn't it true that in\ncommittee we discussed whether or not it\nwould apply to businesses and the answer\nwas actually that there is a court\nprocess already in place where you can\ngo and appeal this\nfinding I'm sure the lady recalls of\nthat discussion in committee can I ask\none more question Mr Speaker if it's a\nparliamentary inquiry I'll let you\nparliamentary inquiry State your inquiry\nis it not true that while $1,000 is a\nfine that is obviously going to make\npeople full\nupset um it is much cheaper than having\nto pay for a child's funeral or the\ncounseling that these families have to\npay when they lose their\nchildren I'm sure the lady has worked\ndiligently on the bill and she\nunderstands all the propositions of the\nbill and the members are um certainly\nvery diligently considered every\nproposition of the\nbill\nfor what purposes representing Saints\nrise

this all gust bu I bring to\nyou Senate Bill 157 I want to thank the\nmajority leader and chairman Strickland\nacross the hall we've really worked on\nthis bill for over the past year and a\nhalf or so and so this bill would move\nus to position of where those who are\napplying for jobs after they have paid\ntheir debt to society would be able to\nhave that record\nclean these boards currently look at\nyour records that go back for many many\nyears and so this would limit review to\n5 years after a MISD aminor conviction\nand 5 years after that incarceration for\na misdemeanor conviction this 5-year\nlimit exempts uh the most serious\nmisdemeanors and felonies as well as\nfelonies that are commonly very re re re\nrelevant to licens and decisions such as\nfraud or embezzlement the 5-year look\nback period is also based on what we\nknow about recidivism data shows that\nmost recidivism happens within 3 years\nof an arrest and almost all recidivism\nhappens within 5 years of an arrest\nlending on this data can help boards\nenhance the efficiency of their record\nreviews this why States like Arkansas\nOklahoma and Indiana limit consideration\nof most offenses to those that occurred\nwithin the past 5 years by leaning on\nwhat we know about that recidivism we\ncan help boards spend more time on the\nfenses that truly matter Mr Speaker the\nchanges that we made here along with\nwhat the majority leaders uh good\nInsight was that we make sure that those\nwho are applying for jobs within Finance\nthose records and convictions can be\nlooked into to make sure that\nindividuals who have not been\nrehabilitated do not enter into these\ninstitutions and have a more likelihood\nor substantial chance of recommitting Mr\nSpeaker that in is in essence the bill\nand I'll stand for any questions\nchairman Knight has a question to your\nright yes sir chairman David nice\nrecognized thank you uh Mr Speaker does\nmy friend you yes sir to my friend\num to my friend I I I've I've got some\nhesitation on here because I I'm trying\nto understand some of the the the\nshifting change in in what we\nhistorically have have have looked at as\nfar as license and our license process\nisn't it true that that license process\nis to make sure that we are protecting\nthe\nconsumer uh the folks who are using the\nprofessions or the\nthe you know the areas of of work here\nyes sir is that true yes sir that that\nwould be true and I I would say that\nthose involving moral turpitude could\nstill be considered under this\nlegislation and and for inquiry um I I\nguess I'm I'm curious as to some of the\nlanguage in here as far as\num you know data that is collected and\nturned in um uh as far as uh looking\nonline 376 through 380 mhm I'm not sure\nwhat what is the relevance of of that\nwhere ethnic and\nracial uh distribution of life and\napplications how is that\nrelated to the fiduciary responsibility\nof these boards to the consumer to the\nGeorgia public yes sir I think within\nthis look back period uh within this\nlicense and application they can see uh\nusually uh if my f friend the gentleman\nfrom down south would recall your\nlikelihood to recommit is within 18 to\n25 or 24 months is what the most recent\ndata would show and so uh We've we've\nhammered this over the years and So\nwithin that 5year time period of the\nlicense and application you would see\nthat the likelihood of recommitting\nwould occur within that first 18 to 24\nmonths final inquiry sir my friend and\nagain this is rhetorical I have I have\nsome reservations here but um as a\nlearned you know as a licensed\nprofessional your I know up under the\nbar give the gentleman your attention\nplease for he has a question which acts\nhis own you know it's licensed for for\nfor\nattorneys would this would\nthis type of\nlegislation would it fit up under the\nlicensing process and the State Bar as\nfar as its standards and its ethics of\nhow it looks at its attorneys yes sir I\nI'll note that this legislation still\npreserves the authority of the boards to\nevaluate when a conviction is relevant\nto that profession and whether that\napplicant has been sufficiently\nrehabilitated to overcome a related\nconviction uh I I'll just leave this to\nmy friend uh uh here in the end notably\nthe most serious offenses will still be\nable to be considered by those boards\nregardless of how old they are uh you're\nlooking at uh potentially seven deadly\nserious grade felonies would still be\nconsidered thank you sir\ngentleman yield for another question\nI'll yield for one last Mr Speaker I\nknow the hour is late and there's okay\nuh representative ntz to your left has a\nquestion does gentleman yield to my\nfriend from maretta\nyes thank you is it not true that part\n10 addresses dry\nneedling that is my understanding does\ngentleman further yield I do is it not\nfurther true that after 40 days of\nsitting in these

a\nmotion thank you Mr Speaker I move to\nagree to the Senate substitute on House\nBill 9005\nMr cler will you read the caption House\nBill 905 to be entitled act to amend\nchapter 66 and title 36 of the official\ncode of Georgia anit relating to zoning\nprocedures as pertaining to counties and\nMunicipal\ncorporations representative Reeves is\nrecognized to explain his motion thank\nyou Mr speakers house colleagues I\npresent to you house bill 9005 as\namended by the Senate uh sections two\nthrough the end of the bill Section 8\nare largely intact from what we\noverwhelmingly passed by the house it is\nan amendment to the zoning procedures\nlaw that clarifies that U permits and\nadministrative type permits are not\nrequired to go through the zoning\nprocess that is a choice of the local\ngovernment officials it's not a\nrequirement that'll help building uh go\nuh smoothly and that's something we\npassed overwhelmingly and I'd like to\nacknowledge the great work of\nRepresentative Roberts over two years to\nget that achieved during the Senate uh\nseveral weeks ago at the committee level\nin the uh state and local government\ncommittee uh Senator G committee uh the\npresident protm of the Senate requested\nsection one to be added to the bill uh\nthis is a very narrow Amendment to the\nannexation procedures under Georgia law\nwhich would in very limited\ncircumstances allow a property that is\n10 acres or smaller to move from one\ncity to another city not to a County uh\nbut to another city it gives due process\nto the city that would uh be proposed to\nlose the property to file a challenge\nunder georg's uh annexation challenge\nlaw it gives a narrow window of 2016 and\n17 as the formation of the new city and\nthe property must be commercial not uh\nresidential so those are very limited\ncircumstances I would point to lines 27\nthrough 30 of the bill that was language\nthat the attorney for one of the cities\nthat would be affected got added to the\nbill to uh provide some due process and\nuh the ability to be heard on issues of\nbonding um again it's very narrow and it\nis something requested at high levels\nfrom the Senate that was done through\nthe open process over the last uh two to\nthree weeks uh not not over the last few\ndays so I commend this to you I\nrespectfully request your agreement to\nthis Senate substitute on this good bill\nthat will help building permits and it\nhas this very narrow amendment to\nGeorgia annexation law uh and Mr Speaker\nI yield the well you have one question\nI'd like for you to take if you don't\nmind thank you Mr Speaker representative\nBruce has a question in the back thank\nyou there's a gentleman y I do I do I\nreally need y'all to listen to this\nplease is it not true that the amendment\nthat you're talking about was will only\nimpact the city of South Fulton and it\ncame about as a result of a\ndeveloper that did not get his\nway and came and talked to one of his\nfriends in the Senate and asked us to\nallow a city to take land from another\ncity because they did not get the zoning\nthat they\nwanted is that true representative Bruce\nI I believe there are two sides to that\nstory but there are four cities that are\naffected as best we could tell South\nFulton Union City Stone Crest and\nLithonia it's very narrow also the bill\nsunsets in\n2027 and and that's it is it not true\nthat that what you just described is the\nsame developer that is trying to take\nland because he did not get the zoning\nthat he wanted that's the bottom line\nwhat we're doing is we're Crea I I\nreally need y'all to keep quiet for a\nminute please gentleman ask your\nquestion and then we're going to let the\ngentleman\nanswer is it again is it not true that\nthe developer did not get his way and as\na result of that we're asking this body\nto take sides and allow a city to take\nland from another city without the city\nhaving a say in wanting to do that\nthat is that's the question\nrepresentative Bruce I would draw your\nattention to page two of the bill zoning\nuh bonding many issues can be considered\nby both cities in an arbitration\nproceeding under Georgia law by the\nDepartment of Community Affairs if there\nis an objection and the city that would\npropose to lose the property would be\nable to present its case and would win\nby the preponderance of the evidence if\nthere is zoning or other issues that are\nat stake it gives a full and fair\nopportunity to be heard it gives due\nprocess thank you Mr Speaker I yield the\nwell on
