nobody happy and daddy's not happy they nobody cares amen I want to share I want to share a scripture but I just want to say thank you for your service I realize that I realize from speaker rolston on to every representative it's a sacrifice it's a service for what you do and from the bottom of my heart is a Georgia man as a pastor I simply just want to say thank you for all you do I greatly greatly appreciate it and it's I've been coming for a long time we've got new people and then I see my friend for the calvin here that we've been coming for 30 years together he's been coming for 47 and it's just an honor and privilege to be where you wonderful people there's a scripture that says in a 1st Samuel 17 David said the Lord delivered me out of a pauve a line the Lord delivered me out of a pauve a bear and the Lord that will deliver this philistine into my hand I want to take just a few moments and I want to talk to you about defeating giants defeating giants you know we we live normal lives and we have problems along the way I've got problems you got problems all God's children got problems but I want you to know something every once in a while a giant will jump up every once in a while we will encounter a giant and that's what happened to this boy David there was a giant he was almost 10 feet tall he weighed 500 pounds his armor was 150 pounds and he encountered a giant and if we live long enough we'll encounter giants but David overcame his giant and I want to just give you some steps to overcoming the giants in our lives the first step is persistence persistence you know David didn't get a lot of encouragement his daddy didn't encourage him his brothers didn't encourage him King Saul didn't encourage him but David just refused to quit you know persistence is what got the snail on the arc some of your slow but you're avoiding for him and persistence is what got the snail on the arc he just refused to quit you know Sir Winston Churchill was asked on one occasion what equipped you to lead Britain during World War II what what gave you the ability to lead Britain through the most difficult time in the history of that country and Sir Winston Churchill said I repeated a class in grade school and the reporter said wait so you flunked and Sir Winston Churchill said no I didn't flunk I was given a second opportunity to get it right and I'm grateful for the second opportunities we have to get it right I want to encourage you if you're battling a giant just be persistent just don't quit but then there's a second step it's progression when David went against that giant he said the Lord delivered me out of a pauve line the Lord delivered me out of a pauve a bear and he'll deliver this giant into my hand here's what I want to encourage you God's going to see us through God's going to see us through he always has seen us through are we going to get through covid I'll promise you we're going to get through covid because we've gotten through things before and I'm grateful in our lives that we can look back and say God's always brought us through and he'll bring us through this how do you conquer a giant you do it through persistence you do it through progression what you do it through some proven weapons some proven weapons Saul said why don't you take my armor David said no it won't fit and there's some proven weapons one of those proven weapons is the Bible our first president George Washington said we can't govern without God in the Bible another proven weapon is prayer Abraham Lincoln said I've been driven of my knees by an overwhelming conviction that I had nowhere else to go my wisdom and all about me seemed insufficient in the day they will come times that our wisdom and all about us will be insufficient how do we overcome the giant persistence progression proven weapons and in conclusion in conclusion brother speaker when my daughter was little girl I was speaking one Sunday and she brought a friend home with her and that friend was in church for the very first time and I said in conclusion and that friend said to my daughter Savannah Abigail what does it mean when your daddy says in conclusion and Savannah said absolutely nothing but I promise you in conclusion there's one other thing to defeat your giant it's praise before David defeated the giant he was grateful he expressed gratitude he hadn't won the battle yet but express gratitude I'm convinced many times we're grumbly hateful when we ought to be humbly grateful and gratitude will change our lives I heard about a lady that got up one morning and she had three hairs on her head and she said you know I believe I'll braid my hair today I'll tell you what change a lot of people's lives if they just learn how to smile I tell preachers that your church would grow if you just teach your people how to smile you say well pastor be near I don't have any teeth will just come me today if amen just smile she got gets up the next morning she's got two hairs on her head and she says you know I just believe I'll part my hair in the middle today she gets up the next morning she's got one hair on her head and she said you know what I believe I believe I'll just wear my hair in a ponytail she gets up the next morning miss Susan she's got no hairs on her head she said praise God I don't have to do my hair today you said pastor I'm battling a giant persistence persistence just stick in there stick in there number two progression God's brought you through he's going to bring us through this also number three proven weapons it's the word of God it's prayer and number four you just praise you just express gratitude somebody said thank God for dirty dishes for they have a tailed a tail while others are going hungry we're doing pretty well with home health and happiness we should not make a fuss by the stack of evidence before us God's been very good to us God's been very good to us let's stand to our feet and pray Lord I want to thank you for the privilege of being here today we're speaker Rawlston I want to thank you for being with representative Matthew act and what a privilege to be with friends because I consider these people my friends I thank you for their service to our great state not only their service but their sacrifice and I pray today your protection I pray your wisdom I pray your God is up on them and up on their families God encourage their families as these individuals serve us and I am wise enough to know speaking to this many individuals there are needs in their midst and God meet the needs of these representatives today and for all you do we're going to praise you for I pray this prayer in Jesus Christ name amen I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United

I'm honored to be joined up here by chairman Eddie Lumsden We're here to talk about a friend of both of us and a constituent of his In one guy's humble opinion He was the greatest lawyer to set foot in a courtroom in the history of our state Shrewd Cunning Brilliant and a gifted order To earlier generations of Georgia lawyers he was what the profession was all about But the quality that set Bobby Lee Cook above all others was his credibility He had the respect and trust of judges and adversaries But it was his credibility with jurors that made him special juries trusted him and believed that when he said it it had to be true A fierce competitor in the courtroom. He was always the epitome of a gentleman To those with whom he clashed he was civil and respectful And then he would rip your heart out before you saw it coming He was as former governor Roy Barnes said over the weekend larger than life He tried cases all over Georgia and beyond His fame extended across the nation But he was and remained always a son of Somerville and Chateauga County And when he passed Thursday night he was on top of the mountain in Chateauga County Few remember that he served in this body and he served across the hall Because he was above all a champion among lawyers But I tell you for all of his greatness He had one major character flaw He was an unrepentant Hardcore died in the wool Democrat And I suspect he was that way until The Lord called him home Thursday night He and I often joked about how our mountain traditions may have led us to different parties But that it ultimately brought us back to a common ground I Last visited with him about two years ago for at any length And we had a good good visit he said I remember one thing he said be proud of your independent streak It is what marks a mountain man And I will remember that advice and other conversations we had and I will cherish the times that I watched He and watched and listened as he and my dad argued good naturedly Because you could do that at one point in our history about politics And they would tell stories own and own and own We will remember Bobby Lee Cook of Somerville as perhaps Georgia's greatest lawyer But we should also celebrate his devotion to the Constitution His clients over the years could be described Charitablely as a rogue's gallery But he believed every provision in our Constitution was important and applied to all of us equally In his mind our justice system Serve not only to keep us safe But to keep us free They will be telling Bobby Lee Cook stories for generations if we just won't know if they were true Because we didn't know if they were true during his lifetime But this we will know He was a lion Giant and he truly left his footprint on this state Rest in peace my friend Madam speaker if we could have a moment of silence to reflect upon his life Thank you very much The chair recognizes chairman Parsons from morning order Thank you, madam speaker We hard to follow that, but I do want to tell you about a wonderful lady This is my this is my

herself and those working with her She was appointed to the board of the Virginia Foundation for the Humanities and Public Policy By former governor Charles Robb It's impossible to count the many lies she touched in her lifetime and I was one of them I want to be sure that if any of her students followed her past she would be pleased and smile and say I was just a volunteer She was a wonderful lady and I can tell you this I took European history and then Eastern history Chinese history From her class and I can tell you anything and everything that I know about China I learned from her class and there was totally what she taught was totally non-political It was about the culture and about the people She was a great lady And even more than that she was a great Christian lady Miss Ellen Kapies

He lost almost all of them Be understood as long as he kept his army alive. He could win our nation's freedom The british called him the old fox cornwallis Commander the most elite army in the entire planet for bat bragged He would bag him in the morning, but it was Washington who bag cornwallis at the very complicated tri-nation quad army land and see victory at yorktown Washington didn't write a single word of the constitution, but his towering leadership presided over the impossibly divided delegates leading to the great compromise is that created the single most portant document in history Washington's leadership as a president of the nyan states created the in-list presidencies setting a sterling example that all future presidents should lead with the servant's heart The decision to step down as after two terms was his greatest achievement of all When king George the third of england heard what he had done He called him the greatest man in the world Yet this giant was so humble that in his farewell address He actually apologized saying I'm too sensible of my defects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors He besieged the all-money in his countrymen to look upon his and I quote incompetent abilities with indulgence After almost 300 years George roched into remains first in war first in peace first in the heart of us countrymen Thank you mr.

Well let's start off with the Civil War and one courageous Black woman and the woman I'm talking about is Harriet Tubman. Harriet Tubman was born into slavery but oh she did not let that hold her back she freed herself from that slavery only to go back and free over 70 slaves through the underground railroad she was a spy for the Union Army and later an activist for women's suffrage movement see Harriet Tubman created made history and created and delivered a tomorrow for us to live and now we go on to the Civil Rights Movement and all another courageous woman this is a white woman her name is Viola Luzzo Viola Luzzo is a 39-year-old wife and mother of five children that after witnessing the horrific actions that were going on in Alabama left her family in Detroit and traveled to Alabama to march with Martin Luther King she was murdered March 25th 1965 why because she could see past color and gave Black demonstrators arrived from Selma to Montgomery Alabama see Viola Luzzo made history that delivered a tomorrow worth living so I stand here doing Black History Month in a building that people who look like me were not even allowed to serve in and I'm going to say a prayer for everyone that's in here and my prayer is that we collectively are individually will make history that will deliver a tomorrow that is worth living thank you mr.

Speaker ladies and gentlemen the House I bring to you the House Bill 307 this is a telehealth bill if there can be any possible thing that is good out of this pandemic and I'm I say that sort of tongue in cheek it will be the fact that we probably not 10 years off the time it would normally have taken for people patients to get used to telemedicine medicine and being and having the convenience of having a chat with their doctor by zoom instead of an in-person meeting much of the telehealth medicine that has been practiced for the last year has happened because of the emergency powers of our governor and release of some restrictions by CMS and people have found it to be very beneficial so if we go off those emergency powers without House Bill 307 many of those forms of dealing with patients in this new form would disappear so what this does is puts most of those privileges that we have had in the new innovations into our law so that they will continue after the pandemic telemedicine is so convenient for patients and there's one place it's especially good and that is dealing with patients with mental health problems during the pandemic we have seen a rise a significant rise in suicides and drug and alcohol abuse and family violence child violence and these and because we are so lacking in people in those in positions and psychologists and people that deliver our mental health services across the state telemedicine is one of the ways that we can expand those services especially into our rural areas and especially to people who may not have the ability to go to a defects office or have the ability to have telecommunications one of the things that this bill does is says that psychiatrists and the people in the mental health field can use the telephone to deliver this services so Mr. Speaker if there are no questions I will ask for favor consideration of House bill 307 and if there are no questions I'll yield a well you do have a question if you care to yield I will yield Mr. Speaker recognize as representative Jasmine Clark in the gallery thank you for your left does the General Lady yield I do so I had a constituent contact me and say that when they use telehealth there was restrictions on their ability to get certain types of prescriptions through telehealth does this bill address that issue no it really doesn't because those restrictions are federal with CMS currently and we have to abide by those and so hopefully they are looking to review how they deal with prescription orders through telemedicine and hopefully that will change going forward thank you for bringing this bill thank you you have no further questions thank you Mr. Speaker and I ask for your favor consideration of House bill 307 thank you is there any objection to the previous question being ordered the chair here's none the previous question is ordered is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute the chair here's none the committee substitute is adopted is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill the chair here's none the report of the committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote I those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines have all members voted have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House bill 307 the eyes are 158 the nasor zero this bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed clerk will read the caption to House bill 362 House bill 362 by members and it rose 120th and others to be entitled back to men code section 1222 the fiscal to George antenna relating environmental protection division environmental advisory council duties to the council and its members and directors this bill have an refer to the committee on game fishing parks that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute chair recognizes the chair of the game fishing parks committee chairman charay roads to present the bill thank you mr.

Williams, into the 115th and others to be entitled back to amend. Title 46 of the fiscal year of Georgia, Antietta, relating to public utilities and public transportation, so as to prohibit governmental entities from adopting any policy that prohibits the connection or reconnection of any utility service. This bill having referred to the Committee on Energy Utilities and Telecommunications. The Committee recommends that this bill do pass by Committee substitute. Chair recognizes Representative Williams and the present to bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, I bring for you today for your consideration House Bill 150 by Committee substitute LC364621S. This bill quite simply would protect citizens rights to choose the energy field choice that best fits their budgets. In prohibit local governments from the non-fuel service base solely on the tight or source of the energy being provided by the utility company. Now I want to stress that this is not happening in Georgia and that both the Georgia Municipal Association as well as the Association of County Commissioners remain neutral on the measure. Furthermore, it comes with no objection from the Meag cities with a municipal which are called the Municipal Elected Authority Cities of Georgia, nor any objection from the Municipal Gas Association of Cities of Georgia. So the logical question to ask is why do we need this measure? Well, what's happening is in some areas of our country, well-meaning local governments have started enacting ordinances banning connections and furthermore, reconnections to utility energy sources based solely on the tight or the source of the energy being offered. This is being done in attempts to help their communities realize net zero carbon goals. The current fuel choice is being singled out just happened to be natural gas and propane products. But in the future, think about it. It could also include the source of electricity production as well. For example, such as mandating only the certain renewable energies being used, all of which, and we all know this, all of which have their own unique environmental challenges, or it could prohibit energy produced by nuclear production, even though the environmental community at large is sort of divided on that question as far as whether or not that's a clean energy. Furthermore, these vans ignore the fact that natural gas and propane gas are, in fact, low-cost, efficient, clean burning fuels that have actually led the charge in helping reduce greenhouse emissions as they have replaced less efficient fuels, especially in the production of electricity. House Bill 150 gives Georgia's a resilient path for assuring the lowest possible energy pricing in their homes and businesses. It assures consumers freedom of choice, and lets the free market work keep energy pricing low. This competition helps every Georgian, especially our most economically vulnerable citizens, on limited incomes. Furthermore, it protects our hospitality industry, which is historically dependent on fuel choice, especially our restaurants have been extremely hard hit during this pandemic. This is why this bill is supported by the Georgia Restaurant Association and the Georgia Hotel and Lodging Association. Fuel choice helps our farmers keep their business inputs low, which helps hold down our food costs. That's why it's endorsed by the Georgia Poultry Association, the Georgia Farm Bureau and the Georgia Agri Business Council. It protects our jobs from our very largest industries to our especially vulnerable small employers. That's why it's endorsed by the Georgia Chamber of Commerce, the Georgia Association of Manufacturers, the Georgia Mining Association, the Georgia Contracts Association, the Georgia Economic Developers Association. Furthermore, it protects the land and resale values of our homes and businesses. That's why it's endorsed by the Georgia Realters Association, the Georgia Home Builders Association and the Council for Quality Growth. All these are fantastic organizations representing almost 11 million Georgia's and we all have friends in each one of these organizations. All of them are in favor of this measure. During our committee hearings, it was a passionate objection alleging that this bill infringes on local government's authority. Home rule only affects the ability of the General Assembly to pass local laws, which this measure is not doing. This bill is a matter of general law and it protects fuel choice for Georgia's. Another objection is global warming concerns and again natural gas in particular has been a fantastic do and helping to keep to reduce Georgia's energy production carbon footprint. Again, the Georgia Municipal Association as well as ACCG have not objected to remain neutral on the bill. However, if community start banning fuel choice, there will be unintended economic consequences. For example, older homes that were designed to be heated by natural gas, all of these homes are older than perfectly safe wiring systems and the electrical panels were not designed to carry the load for electric heat sources. The nine natural gas services, enforcing expensive and unnecessary wiring upgrades will be a huge financial burden to Georgia citizens. Also, many citizens choose to heat one room at a time. All of us have friends and family that do this. And natural gas space heaters are a very economical way of doing it. In closing, I want to point out that nothing in this measure precludes local governments from incentivizing their citizens to make fuel choices at the leadership of the direction of the local governments. Just like any local government has economic development tools that they're disposable, similar measures could be taken to help protect the wallets of their citizens and not pay for fuel choices on the backs of ratepayers let it come out of the revenues that the city already has to incentivize these types of behaviors. Mr. Speaker, that's the bill. I'd be happy to answer any questions if there are any if not all love to yield the well and ask the available consideration. Do you yield for questions? Yes, sir. I do. Chair recognizes chairman Petri to your left for a question. Does gentleman yield? I do. Representative, is it not true that this bill in no way encumbers renewable energy from expanding in this state? That is correct. And is it not true that this bill really is about freedom, the freedom of consumers to choose any type of energy they want to include renewable energy sources that I very strongly support? Is that not true? That is correct. And the footnote on that is that competition drives prices lower. And just as we've seen in, for example, our electric car market that right now battery production facilities are moving the US. We're driving down the cost we can compete with other foreign governments on producing these same type technologies here at a lower price point. And the only thing that drives that is competition. Good question. Do you further yield? Yes, sir. Chair recognizes representative Carpenter to your right for a question. Does the gentleman yield? I do. Representative Williamson, do you cook eggs every morning? Have you ever tried cooking eggs on an electric stove? I'm forcing them having to do that in Atlanta one of here. That's funny. This bill would put such a burden on restaurants. I'm not even sure that the waffle house would even exist if we pass if we didn't pass this bill. Natural gas is important for the for my industry and for all restaurant tours. So I appreciate you bringing this measure and we're all for local control until locals get out of control. I appreciate you. Thank you. I'd like to further yield. I'll yield for one more minute speaker. Chair recognizes chairman Tarvan to your right for a question. gentleman yield. Happy to yield to my friend from Northwest Georgia. Being in the home building business in my life, people are looking for homes on natural gas where there's a pipeline. What would this do if I had a home in a city or town that decided not to allow this and I got ready to sell my home and they had passed this law. Would the buyer be able to re-hook to that? Yes. Again, this is not happening in Georgia, but this is basically being preemptive. This bill would preclude the ability to not reconnect. So you're correct. If if the ordinance were passed that stopped the connection or reconnection in this example, natural gas, then it would severely impact the resell value of that home. Gentlemen, further yield. One more. That would be that would drive down the price of my home because it was not as attractive to somebody with lower heating cost. That's correct. Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the well and ask for your favor. It's about his favor consideration. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, we have others that wish to be heard on the measure. Chair recognizes representative Dreyer to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise in opposition to House Bill 150. I'm sure a lot of you have been to Taipei Island. Right there on Butler Street a few years ago, I noticed a signpost that goes straight up and it shows where sea level rise will impact Taipei Island. At three feet about half of the island is underwater. So that would include my friends, business, Ronnie at Sea Kayak, Georgia. The other time when I was on a trip there, I took my four-year-old kayak in on that dock behind the crab shack. I think a few of you have been there. And we're kayaking out and you was four at the time, a dolphin crested right in front of our kayak. That business would be gone at three feet of sea level rise. At seven feet, we've lost Taipei Island and a lot of our other barrier islands. One of my goals is to visit each of the barrier islands with my kids. They may not be there. Already, if you're going from Brunswick to St. Simon's and you take a right from Glen Avenue onto the Causeway, during a super moon, you've got water flooded in the right turn lane. If we do nothing about carbon emissions by 2100, we'll have 8.2 feet of sea level rise. What I have to think about when I'm at the beach is that my kids, if they choose to have children, likely won't be able to take their kids to the same beaches I've taken them to. And that is caused for serious concern. But my kids will ultimately be okay because of the privileges they have. But folks that aren't so advantaged, folks that are disadvantaged, grew up in historically poor areas are going to fill the brunt. The Gula Gichi come to mind on Sapporo Island who I've sat with over time. That island would be gone. And that's not to mention the threat of more extreme weather because of climate change, oceans are warmer and there are more hurricanes and more intense hurricanes. By 2050, Savannah is at risk of flooding every year for what once was considered a hundred-year flood. And we don't talk about the record cold this past week. How does that work with climate change? Well, if you look at the jet stream that flows through the northern part of our country, that actually serves to insulate the Arctic air. That was weakened because of climate change. The Arctic air has come down, setting record setting temperatures, but what happens on the other side? This past week, the Arctic in certain places was 57 degrees above where it normally is this time. From wildfires to record temperatures to storms to flooding, we're already seeing the first effects of climate change. And this is caused by CO2 in the atmosphere. It's beyond debate. I've heard earlier that natural gases clean air. That ER is doing a whole lot of work because natural gas emissions are somewhere between 50 to 80% as dirty as coal. Natural gas is now the largest contributor to greenhouse gases in the world. It's not sustainable long-term. And no one's doing this. And what we're coming up with is the worst case scenario. They're going to ban restaurants from using natural gas. They're going to stop somebody from reconnecting. Those things can easily be solved. But that's not what this bill does. This bill says no more... This bill says you have to permit new natural gas infrastructure 20, 30 years down the road. If a local government wants to be innovative 15 years from now, when renewables are affordable, reliable and readily accessible, we're prohibiting them from doing...\n\nthat and when you build new natural gas infrastructure 15 years from now it's going to take 30 years to get your return on this. I don't know why we're prejudicing cities and counties 15 20 years down the road with something today that may happen. I spoke about my children and my grandchildren. After the committee meeting when I mentioned that the Bill sponsor said well I care about my children and grandchildren too and I believe that he's a good man but the thing is we're making decisions today that will affect them. They're going to have to live with our decisions today and they're depending on us to be their voice. I'm casting my vote today for my kids Henry and Leo and I'm casting my vote today for other kids that are in Georgia and they will come to Georgia and they will be born in Georgia and I'm voting no and I'm joining various city leaders urging us to vote no. Thank you Mr. Speaker I yielded well. Okay we have a minority report and then we have a request for the chairman's time both of which are under rule 20 minutes each chair recognizes to present the minority report representative Jrenner. Thank you Mr. Speaker. You know the arguments that have been presented illustrate that there is from my perspective a tipping point between the climate of change and the change of climate. First is important to note that all local governments are ultimately subject to state control only the federal government and state governments have any constitutional authority all cities counties school districts and other forms of local government will power at the discretion of the federal government or more often their state. So from a legal standpoint state preemption may be acceptable but used judiciously. House Bill 150 is a result of five out of 535 governments that have passed publicly supported resolutions committing to a transition to clean energy or 0.9% of local governments in Georgia. One of the arguments for this measure is that the potential for stranded costs associated with infrastructure. Well let's talk about that for a minute passing a resolution to move towards something is different from doing it. Don't you have to have the technology to provide the service before you can discontinue the use of another resource. This bill's sole premise is based on hypotheticals not substantive policy changes as the author stated this hasn't happened in Georgia. There are good reasons for states to allow local governments to implement their own policies. City officials and residents know what is important to them and often have a better understanding of how to achieve their goals. The importance of local knowledge in a good decision making is one reason why state officials should defer to local governments. Another reason is that by allowing local governments to implement different policies we get a better understanding of what works and what does not. Successful policies that result from experimentation at the local level can then filter up to the state level while unsuccessful policies can be discarded before they are imposed on the entire state. Different local policies allow people to choose the government that is best for them. In other words people can vote with their feet. If all local policies were imposed on cities by state governments there would be far less variety and many people would be worse off due to the lack of choices. This bill's about choice. It's about the heavy hand of a state telling five governments that their resolution somehow is going to impact restaurants, bars. It's a preemption bill. In closing, let me say this. Government intrusion into the marketplace distorts the efficiency with which a competitive market economy can allocate society's resources. And it creates something called a market failure. Market failures warrant government intervention. A market failure occurs when the private market is not efficient. House bill 150 highlights one such failure. And that is the existence of monopolies. The utilities refer to in 150 are monopolies. And the role of government with regard to a monopoly is to ensure that the public is treated fairly. This bill does not treat the public fairly. This bill distorts the economy leading to less economic growth and therefore decrease quality of life for future generations. Any preemption bill state intervention should always be exercised with caution. And it should be done to promote rather than hinder economic freedom. I ask you to vote no. We cannot stop technology today on a hypothetical. This is a bad bill and it sets a bad precedent. I ask you to vote no. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Okay, we're going on now to the Chairman's time. Chair recognizes Chairman Parsons the chair of the committee. Thank you. You speak, Rustin. I'm going to be brief. I could actually talk about this for a long time, but I'm not going to. I know we have some other people that want to speak on it. And they probably would be better speak on tonight would anyway. But I do want to say a couple things. First of all, it is a good bill. And there's nothing wrong with the bill whatsoever. But this bill actually went through two subcommittees. It went to a subcommittee two times I should say and the full committee has been thoroughly vetted. You know, it was said a few minutes ago that we need to treat the public fairly. I think that I agree with that. But it's not to treat the public fairly on providing electricity is not through allowing the cities to set portfolios. It's allowing the people to do that. And I think long term what we need what we will have to have what we need to have is that some demand side control on the electricity that you're provided, but not letting cities set these things. And then I think the only thing I'm going to say about or say about this after that is that I don't know what this would do to the grid. I want you to look down to Texas right now what they've been going through and a lot of their problems actually relates to the grid. Now, it relates to really bad unexpected weather, but it also relates to the grid. I fear that what the cities want to do would unbalance the grid so badly that we can have chaos without bad weather. The grid has to be balanced. And that's what Georgia power and our power suppliers do. They spend a lot of time on that. There's ways to do that. They have engineers that they do that to provide these cities to do that on their own. I think we could create some chaos. And with that, Mr. Speaker, I want to yield the remainder of the chairman's time to the author of the bill, Representative Williams and to Representative Chairman Chuck Martin. And with that, I'll yield the one. Yeah, you may do that. Who's going first? Representative Williams. Chair recognizes Representative Williamson for some portion of the chairman's time. Mr. Speaker, if Chairman Martin doesn't mind, I'd like to wrap it up, but I'll leave that chairman Martin. But one of the gentleman mentioned very passionately about love of our coast, the love of Georgia. And I just can't let this go without saying I'm a father of four Eagle Scout sons. I've spent time on every one of those islands with the exception of St. Catharines hiking and camping with the sons. My sons, I've spent innumerable hours out there. I have a deep love for our coast. We've got to meet Miss West on on Osaball Island had numerous trips out there. It's just special and nothing to happen to our beautiful. I want to say we have 40% of the coastal marshes on the whole eastern seaboard. It's a fantastic jewel. But just like the Bible talks about it in Ecclesiastes, it's a season, a rim and a time to get things done. And now's not the time to take away consumers choice. We talked about what the local governments can do, but you're taking away consumers choice in this instance. I want to reiterate that not only is this a bipartisan bill, nothing precludes local governments from incentivizing your citizens because and towards the energy policies you do best for your local citizenry. I did hear the speaker mentioned that if you don't like what a city's doing, you can vote with your feet. But I would remind the commentator on that aspect that if you really don't like it and you leave your home and your property in the city from which you're fleeing the economic loss, you're going to take on that piece of property. If you can no longer sell that home, be reconnected to a field choice of the previously being used, that's going to take a hit to the wallet. So with that being said, Mr. Speaker, I think the body's heard enough. I'd love to call the question and yield the will. Thank you. Gentlemen, as yielded the will, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair hears none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair hears none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair hears none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of House Bill 150 will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 150. The eyes are 103. The nays are 62. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 98. House Bill 98 by Representative Lomston to the 12th and others to be entitled to amend Title 50. The fiscal of Georgia and Tate relating state government, so sort of by conditions for meetings and public hearings to be held by teleconference in emergency conditions. This bill then referred to the committee and government affairs. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by rules committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Lomston to present the bill. Mr. Speaker, members of the House, I bring to you House Bill 98 by committee substitute a bill that comes as a request of the Georgia Municipal Association and is fully supported by the Association of County Commissioners. This bill sets the conditions for state agencies including local governments to hold meetings and hearings during a declared emergency via teleconference. This legislation would authorize cities and counties to hold virtual public hearings and declare the emergencies. Mr. Speaker, that is the bill. I would appreciate your support. I'll be glad to answer any questions. You do not have any questions. Thank you. Appreciate it. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules? The chair here is none. The rules committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill. The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 98. The eyes are 162. The nasa zero this bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 156. House Bill 156 by representative Parsons of the 44th and others to be entitled an act to amend. Thought it was 38 and 50 of the official go to Georgia annotated relating to military emergency management and veteran affairs and state government respectively so to facilitate the sharing of information and reporting of cyber attacks. This bill, haven't referred to the committee on energy utilities and telecommunications. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by rules committee substitute. Chair recognizes chairman Parsons to present the bill. Thank you, Speaker Rustin. House Bill 156 is actually a pretty simple proposition. It would set up a process for what we're calling agencies which are living our agencies of the state and of the local governments to provide information, report information to the Georgia Department of Emergency Management and Homeland Security on cyber attacks. It sets up that process. It gives the director the ability to establish rules and regulations relating to that. It also sets up just a slightly different process for utilities to provide information to the director of the emergency management and Homeland Security and that basically is the same information as they provide to the federal government unless there is some federal law that prevents that from being provided to the state or if there's some federal agency that has some regulation or some rule against that happening. But as you know, our counties actually, GMA came to me with a proposition for this almost two years ago because they were concerned getting hit by these cyber attacks where there were ransom demands and even the Sheriff's Department in the state law enforcement all over the state have gotten these things. I would say I don't want to say anything's impossible but apparently it is impossible to track these things back. A lot of these I would say most of these attacks come from Eastern Europe someplace and they're routed through routed through servers all over the world until they finally hit the location that they could even come through an IP address of yours. I mean they do that sometimes. The last no one IP address will be some innocent person because they've been able to get into that. And so it's causing our taxpayers a lot of money and this isn't it. This is a way to help stop that and it needs to be done. Mr. Speaker I'll be glad to answer any questions if there are any. If not I would ask your favorable consideration of House Bill 156. Do you owe for questions? Yes I do. Chair recognizes Representative Jasmine Clark in the gallery to your left. Over here thank you Mr. Speaker does it do me a deal? Yes I might do. So what are the agencies once they get this information what is the plan what are they going to do with the information that they get like what's the next step in this process? Well I guess I think what you're asking relates to the once the once the information is actually given to the director of the Department of Emergency Services and Homeland Security. Then that will depend upon the rules and regulations but the aim of it is to actually work with GTA and the agencies in the state and their contacts to provide the technical assistance to address the issue. Address the issue concerned with the attack. Thank you. You did not appear to have any further questions. Thank you Speaker and again I would ask your favorable consideration of House Bill 156. Thank you. I yielded well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to withdrawing this committee substitute? The chair here is none the committee substitute is withdrawn. Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules? The chair here is none the rules committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 156. The eyes are 163 the names are zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 268. House Bill 268 by represent work eyes of the 157th and others to be entitled to amend chapter 28 in title 43 the fish voted George annotated relating occupational therapists so as to revise licensing provisions this bill then refer to the committee on regulated industries that committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes chairman work eyes are to present the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker. House Bill 268 authorizes Georgia to participate in the occupational therapy license compact. This is not a new idea we've had at least five of these bills and I think everyone has been chaired by has been sponsored by chairman Belton and I appreciate his help on this one. In fact I think he's got two more for this year but this is for occupational therapy therapist it does not kick in until there are ten states but there are eleven states right now that have pending legislation this will help occupational therapist basically in three different ways it's a for rural folks to get more have more have more accessibility and then as we talked about the chairman Cooper's bill this morning through telehealth and then thirdly for our military who because we have some ebases in Georgia a lot of time they transfer in their spouses who's gone through a rigorous process of getting their license will now be able to be licensed in Georgia as long as they meet the requirements that are current and then have a GBI background check that's the bill and I'll stand for any questions if there are any you do not have any questions I appreciate that and I would ask for your favorable support on House Bill 268 Chair recognizes representative Belton to speak to the bill thank you mr.

House Bill 234 by Representative Hawkins, the 27th and others to be entitled to amend, Title 33, the Fish go to Georgia, and Teter related insurance, so as to provide an option for self-funded healthcare plans. This bill ever referred to the committee and special committee and quality healthcare, that committee recommends a dis bill, do pass. Chair recognizes Chairman Hawkins to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Last year, Georgia adopted one of the most comprehensive, surprise billing acts in this country, protecting patients from unknown, large medical bills. Space for those bills coming from emergency and non-emergency treatment. This past December, federal legislation was placed into the Ammbus spending act. It does defer to states with comprehensive surprise billing, so our bill will stand. But states do not have the authority to require self-funded plans. These are the employer self-funded plans to comply with state laws or regulation by our insurance commissioner. But at present, states are not prohibited from enacting legislation, which allows such healthcare plans to voluntarily agree to comply to the Sprods Billing Act. Thus passing the bill last year allows us to take another bite of the apple this year and voluntarily by the employers help approximately 60% of the people that were not included in the last year's bill. Mr. Speaker, that is the bill and I will yield any questions. You do not appear to have any questions. I ask for your favorable support of this bill. HV234. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to.
