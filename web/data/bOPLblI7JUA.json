And if any of you\nfolks make it down to Georgia Southern,\nyou might want to know these people that\nI'm going to introduce to you today.\nIt's Chief of Police Day here at the\nCapitol, as you all know. And we're glad\nto have some of our finest here with us\ntoday. The chief of police at Georgia\nSouthern University. They're in the\nback. Trey Drowy. Raise your hand. Trey,\nCharlie Bowen,\nDavid Wright, and Tyrone McBride.\n[applause]\nThank you for being here today and thank\nyou for what you do every day to make\nour campuses and uh safe. Appreciate\ny'all being here. Thank you. Okay, let's\ngo ahead and get started. Uh,\nwell, I was going to take the ladies\nfirst, but Chairman Glet, go ahead since\nyou're up there.\n[laughter]\n>> Represent Ball.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I've and\nmembers of the committee, I've got House\nBill 1181. That's on page three. It's\nabout the fifth one down.\nThis bill uh cuts some red tape that um\nis in our code. It it allows a deedent's\ncar title to come directly from the\nstate where the estate is doiciled to\nthe firstdegree relative who is a\nGeorgia resident. Currently under\nGeorgia law, if the executive is in a\ndifferent state, it has to be titled in\nthat different state before it can be\ntitled in Georgia. And so I want to get\nrid of that intermediate step\nand I'll take any questions the\ncommittee has.\n>> Okay. Don't don't see any questions.\nThank you.\n>> Okay. Thank you so much.\n>> Vice Chair Hong Sue Hong.\n>> Thank you chairman and members of the\ncommittee. I have HB 1024 which is on\npage two, bottom of page two. This bill\nwill update the current bankruptcy\nhomestead exemption, which has not been\nupdated for over 10 years, and it will\nincrease it to $50,000 for individual\nfiling and 100,000 for joint filers.\nThank you. I'll take any questions.\n>> Okay. Don't see any questions. Thank\nyou.\n>> Thank you,\n>> Chairman.\nThank you, members. um take a little bit\nof personal privilege if you don't mind\njust to explain this bill a little bit\nmore in depth than I normally would. Um\nthis is House Bill 256. It's LC481711s.\nUh it was Chairman Weed's bill prior to\nhis resignation and I have taken it over\nsince then. It's a bill that we passed\nvery similarly in 2024\num but didn't get an agree over in the\nSenate. I think we've worked that out.\nBut what this bill does is it updates\nthe Georgia's foster parent bill of\nrights um to reflect how foster care is\nactually delivered today. Since the\noriginal bill was enacted in the early\n2000s, placements now now routinely\ninclude defax foster parents, private\nagency foster parents, relative\ncaregivers, and fictive kin. This bill\nensures that all caregivers providing\nday-to-day care to to children in the\nstate are treated consistently and\nfairly. The bill focuses exclusively on\nthe relationship between foster\ncaregivers and the department of family\nand children services. It does not\ncreate new rights in juvenile court.\nDoes not alter custody or judicial\nauthority and does not mandate new\nservices or expenditures. What it does\nis it clarifies and updates existing\nrights rel uh related to communication,\ntraining, participation in case\nplanning, normaly for children and\nprocedural fairness. It reinforces a\nreasonable and prudent parent standard.\nuh provides explicit protection against\nretaliation and creates a clear\nadministrative grievance process. Uh the\nbill also establishes a certified\nvolunteer advocate program which is\noverseen by the office of child advocate\nto support foster parents during\nadministrative interrogations and\ndisputes. I'm sorry, not interrogation,\ninvestigations or disputes. Uh this\nadvocate is not legal counsel and does\nnot interfere with child safety\ndecisions. Um ultimately this bill is\nabout stability and retention. As you\nall know, 30 to 50% of foster parents\nleave the system each year, often citing\na lack of support, clarity, or fairness\nin the process. Um, we're just improving\ntransparency and consistency. And I\nthink this bill is the is the right way\nto go and happy to answer any questions\nwith it.\n>> Okay. I have a question, Secretary\nKelly.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman\nGullet, you talk about the certified\nvolunteer advocate. I know we have the\nCASA advocates for the children.\n>> So,\n>> is this just like a parallel program for\nthe actual foster parents?\n>> Yeah, basically it's it's approved by\nthe uh\nuh\nit's in the section for relative care.\nI'm sorry, certified. Yeah, it's it's\napproved by the child advocate and\nprotection of children. So, exactly.\nIt's basically a CASA for foster parents\nwhen they have disputes with with\ndefects.\n>> Okay. Thank you.\nhave a question. Chairman Smith.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Is it not true\nthat you yourself are foster parent and\nyou and your wife have actually adopted\nyour child? And I commend you for your\npatience as you work through that\ntedious process and thank you for\nbringing this to us.\n>> Thank you so much. That's very true.\n>> Chair Lady Cooper.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just have a\nquestion. Is the department in favor of\nthis bill? Yeah, the department helped\nme work through the language of the bill\nto clarify it. So, I don't ever want to\nspeak for a department. Uh, but they uh\nthey did not they were not against the\nbill.\n>> Okay. Thank you.\n>> Okay.\nDon't see any other questions. Thank\nyou.\n>> Thank you so much.\n>> Okay. Chim Chassain.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the\ncommittee. I have HB 1086 this morning.\nThird page three down. Um, this\nlegislation will help protect Georgia\nfirefighters from injury or death by\nrequiring simple, lowcost signage on\nbuildings that use the light frame wood\nor light frame steel trusses. And we\nwe've seen this across the country where\nmany cities or or counties or even\nstates will pass building codes or\ncodes, fire codes, um, after something's\nhappened. And we want to try to be\nproactive in Georgia and pass a law\nthat'll help first responders and\nfirefighters know that when they're\nentering a building that's on fire, uh\nthat has these type trusses, these these\nlighter gauge trusses, uh they will fail\nquicker under under fire than a normal\nsolid truss or or a higher grade steel.\nAnd this would require like a in\nFlorida, this just passed in Florida uh\na few years ago. they've got an 8 inch\nlike a Maltese cross on on in a visible\nportion of the of the building to let a\nfirst responder know that that building\nuh could fail quicker and they would be\naware of those those circumstances. We\nhave uh the Georgia Fire Chiefs\nAssociation, the Georgia Firefighters\nAssociation, Fire Engineering Service,\nGeorgia Safety and Fire Division, the\nInsurance Commissioner have all endorsed\nthis bill\nand that's pretty much it. It's pretty\nmuch the bill, Mr. Chairman. Okay, we\nhave a question. Shady Cooper,\n>> what did you say they were made of?\n>> Light gauge. It would be the light gauge\nsteel or light gauge wood. So, some of\nthese eye trusses, they have one they\nhave a middle section that goes through\nthere that's pretty thin with the two\neye beams above it. And they're great\ntrusses. They're they're built they're\nengineered. They're they're solid.\nThey're sound. They don't warp. They\ndon't bend. But under fire, they'll\nthey'll fail quicker for danger of\nfirefighters.\n>> Okay. Okay. Because I was just wondering\nwhy we with all our building codes,\nwe're allowing them.\n>> Yeah, they're they're good trusses.\nThey're there's nothing wrong with the\ntrusses at all other than they're a\ndanger when they're under fire.\n>> Thank Thank you.\n>> Yes.\n>> Okay. Don't see any other questions.\n>> Thank you.\n>> Reeves.\n>> Good morning, Chairman Parish and\nmembers of the rules committee. I'm here\nto request House Bill 1042, the bottom\nof page two. This is the Real Estate\nSecurity and Title Act. Uh Vice Chair\nTrey Kelly brought the uh judicial\nsecurity cleanup bill last year. Th this\nis a followup because there was a\nshooting in Indiana of a judge since we\nadjourned Sydney die last year. There\nwas a criminal defendant who tried to\npostpone his trial. The judge denied the\npostponement. He enlisted four\naccompllices to track down where the\njudge lived and the judge and his wife\ngot shot in Indiana. So, the judicial\ncouncil uh looked at uh protecting the\ntax parcel ID, phone number, spouse's\nname, and things like that that could be\nused by people like those accompllices\nin Indiana to find where a judge lives.\nUh this protects our judges. There was a\nsecond real estate title matter. um\nquiet title in many parts of the code\nhas a special master that must be from a\ncounty or or a judicial circuit.\nYesterday I was with a district attorney\nwho has eight counties. Some uh circuits\ndon't have that many counties and there\naren't eligible special masters to help\nclear title. What this bill does is it\nallows the special masters to come from\na federal judicial circuit which is\nabout a third of the state. Uh this was\nrequested by the real property section\nof the state bar. Uh third and finally,\nuh foreclosure funds. Uh we cleaned up\nthis language to add credit union funds\nin addition to banks and savings and\nloans. Uh in addition to cash and\ncashiers checks and then credit bids, we\ncodified the law from several reported\ncases about credit bids. Um thank you,\nMr. Chairman.\n>> Okay.\nDon't see any questions. Thank you, sir.\nRepresent Townsen.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you,\ncommittee. This is uh HB970\nLC650051S.\nThis is a health health bill. This is\nfor Georgia regarding Georgia High\nSchool sports Georgia High School\nassociation sports physicals. This\nbasically codifies and strengthens the\ncurrent u policies for Georgia High\nSchool. It requires either a doctor, Dr.\nOsteopath Medicine, physician assistant\nor nurse practitioner to conduct the\nphysicals. It also requires a\ncardiovascular screening\nfor the um for the participant as well.\nU it has been endorsed by the American\nCollege of Cardiology and the American\nHeart Association. And this is um a bill\nthat came through fruition because there\nare unfortunately some deaths that\nhappen especially during fall practice\nuh cardiac cardiac related and so we're\ntrying to cut down on those. You can\nnever eliminate anything, but if we can\ndo the screenings and have the qualified\nprofessional conduct it, then it's um\nthat's what's best for the kid, the\nstudent athlete. And the physicals last\nup to a year, 12 months or if it's done\nafter April 1st for the entire school\nyear following.\n>> Okay, we have a question. Leader Hugley.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Um to the\ngentleman.\n>> Yes, ma'am. Will there be any difficulty\nin any parts of the state for students\nto obtain this additional requirement\nfor the heart?\n>> No, ma'am. It's uh currently in place\nnow. What this does, we worked with\nGeorgia High School to solidify what\nthey're doing and tighten it up a\nlittle. So, most your schools that are\ndoing the school physicals will still be\ndoing it on site, but the parent does\nhave the right to go to a private\npractitioner and have their own physical\ndone by their own doctor or someone like\nthat.\nI have another question. Chairman Martin\nrepresent represent town. Thank you for\nthe bill. Isn't it true that the heart\nscreening is only required if it's\nindicated? Many schools are doing that\nnow. We're just putting this in statute.\nIt's it's a not requirement for\neverybody, but it's if it's indicated by\na medical professional.\n>> No, you get a hard screening on site of\nthe physical. This bill will require\nthat.\n>> Well, I understand. I just had some\npeople to come to talk to me, but I Can\nI ask about the the further process if\nif it if that screening on site which\nmany people do today is it not true if\nthat indicates something further what\nyou're doing is they then have to go and\nand get that that taking care of the\nathletes.\n>> Yes sir. It is true.\n>> Okay. Don't see any other questions.\nThank you.\n>> Thank you.\n>> Okay. Any members of the committee?\nChairman Jaspers.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. That works. All\nright.\nThank you, Chairman Paris. I've got\nHouse Bill 810 that came from the health\ncommittee the other day. It's a great\nbill that works with Georgiaies because\nthey face a crisis driven by the\npharmacy benefit managers underpaying\nlocalarmacies.\nThey're often reimbursing less than\nactual cost of the drugs. House 810\naddresses this by establishing a\nreimbursement floor ensuring that\npharmacies stay open and pharmacy\ndeserts are avoided. There have been\n200armacies in Georgia closed since 2015\nincluding two in my community.\nEssentially what the bill does is\ncreates a floor price where the PBM must\npay the pharmacy at least the actual\ncost of the drug\nusing day which is national average\nprice. On top of that drug, the PBMS\nmust pay a professional dispens\ndispensing fee to the pharmacy. There'll\nbe no hidden deductions like\nadministrative fees or what's called DIR\nfees which are used to claw back money\nfrom the pharmacy\nand no averaging out using the effective\nrate guarantee doesn't apply to the\nGeorgia state employee plan or Medicaid\nas those are covered by different\nregulations. It's really targeted toward\ncommercial and private insurance plans.\nOkay.\nDon't see any questions. Thank you\nfor Tim Jones.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to ask\num for House Bill 585.\nThis bill closes a current loophole in\nwhich law enforcement is not provided\nwith information in specific and narrow\nsituations in which a vehicle is not\ninsured. So currently law enforcement\nchecks uh information provided to the\nrevenue department by insurance\ncompanies on proof of insurance. The\ninformation though does not include or\nshow when specific persons are excluded\non a policy from driving a vehicle. This\nlegislation will facilitate the transfer\nof that information from insurance\ncompanies to the revenue department,\nwhich would then make it available to\nlaw enforcement when they make a stop or\nif there's an accident. They'll know if\nthe vehicle is insured uh or not insured\nbecause an excluded driver is driving\nthe vehicle. I'm happy to answer any\nquestions.\n>> Got a couple of questions.\n>> Chairman Williamson, do you have\nquestions?\n>> Yes, sir. uh to to the pro Tim, isn't it\ntrue that this is very important to make\nsure that in a at fault traffic accident\nthat the law enforcement officer\nimmediately knows that this is an\nexcluded driver and therefore uh can put\nthe non-vault party on notice that\nthey've got a problem.\n>> That's right.\n>> on their hands. U\nvery very much appreciate your\nleadership on this. It's an important\nloophole that needs to be closed. Thank\nyou.\n>> Got another question. Represent\nWilliams.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nUh to the lady. Representative, do you\nhave any figures on what how it would\naffect our current premiums if we were\nable to eliminate uninsured drivers?\n>> Well, yeah, it it's a burden. So, for\nexample, you you can purchase uh\nuninsured motors coverage, which is\nrelatively inexpensive, but not everyone\nchooses to purchase it. If you do not\npurchase it and you have an accident\nwith an uninsured vehicle, it's all on\nyou. If you do purchase it, which many\nof us do, um it is um it has a an effect\non our rates of raising our rates\nbecause more uh often this this\ninsurance is having to be utilized to\ncover the consequences of a vehicle that\nis uninsured. It it's a valuable uh\nit it is something that you would not\nwant to interfere with the ability of\npeople to purchase a policy that\nexcludes a driver because it can keep\ntheir their rates down. If you have a a\nvery poor driver in your household, you\nmight choose to exclude them from your\npolicy to make your policy more\naffordable. What's happening though is\nthere are some unscrupulous people\nthroughout the state and I heard\nnumerous instances of this from traffic\ncourt judges and others that um they'll\nexclude them to keep the rate down and\nthen they'll allow them to drive it. And\nso what the bill does is it treats\nwith regard to penalties and\nconsequences, it treats it the same, no\ndifferently than we would if a person\ndrove a under normal circumstances did\nnot have coverage on their car.\n>> Have another question. Leader Hugley.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Uh thank you to\nthe gentle lady bringing the bill. I'm\ntrying to understand is the goal to\nshield the person who is allowing\nsomebody to drive that has been\nexcluded.\n>> No ma'am and I appreciate the question.\nSo in I think it's the last very last\npart of the bill uh\nthe um\nactually the wrong bill here. the so the\ntwo last parts of the bill. The first\none um would allow the officer to cite\nthe driver for having lack of insurance.\nThe sec the last part of the bill would\nhold the um policy holder who had\nexcluded uh this particular driver or\nperson from driving the vehicle if they\nknowingly allowed them to. then the\npenalties would be the same for that\nowner of the policy as it would be if\nthe owner of the policy had no policy\nand drove the car uninsured.\nSo the the the goal is to hold um one\nnumber one is to to let the um officer\nknow have the full picture of whether\nthe car is insured or not and then the\nnatural co consequences of that if the\ncar is being util is being driven\nuninsured.\nSecondary\ngoal of the bill is um to protect the\nrest of us so that if you have an\naccident with a vehicle that is\nuninsured that well it would have a a\ndepressive effect because there would be\na penalty and law enforcement would know\nwhat what's happening we think at least\nanecdotally from what I've learned is\nthat people are taking advantage of this\nto get a cheaper polic policy and then\nuh some are knowingly allowing the car\nto be driven uninsured.\n>> Chairman Pal,\n>> I want to thank the lady for bringing\nthis bill, but is it not true? is a very\nsimplified matter that if you own a\npolicy, whether it be business or\npersonal, if you have employees or you\nhave family members or somebody that\nmight wish to borrow you or consistently\nasking you to borrow your car or to use\nyour vehicle, that you can go to your\ninsurance company and say you wish them\nto be excluded from that policy. And\nthat gives a very perfect reason that\nyou can then turn them down to say the\ninsurance company won't insure you. And\nthen when they start talking about well\nmy insurance know that insurance won't\ncover it. So this basically is a safety\nmeasure to keep people with questionable\nor checkered driving records from being\nable to har you borrow your car or your\nvehicle and I thank you for that.\n>> Okay. Don't see any other questions.\nThank you.\nOkay. Little housekeeping here.\nRecognize Secretary Kelly for a motion.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I move that\nHouse Bill 211 be recommended to the\njudiciary committee.\n>> Have a motion and second it go back. Any\nopposition?\nIt's back in judiciary. Have another\none.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I move that\nHouse Bill 1024 be returned to\njudiciary.\n>> Have a motion and second. Any\nopposition?\n>> 10\n>> 1024 1024 211 and 1024 dispatch. Okay.\nThank you. recognize uh vice chairman\nlever.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Um I have a\nrule substitute I would like to proposed\nfor the committee's consideration today.\nIt's a substitute to House Bill 998.\nThat was the uh universal access fund\nbill that I presented last week. Um I\nbelieve the substitute is in your books.\nIt's LC 56570S.\n560570S.\nSo just very briefly, you recall this uh\nbill proposed to make some changes to\nthe universal access fund program which\nhelps ensure the availability and\naffordability of just basic telephone\nservice in rural areas of our state. The\nareas where it may not always be\neconomical for companies to provide that\nservice.\nunder the program, if they agree to\nprovide service in the areas where it\ndoesn't always make economic sense um\nand to also have their rate subject to\nregulation, they're allowed to seek\nreimbursement for some of the costs of\nproviding service in those areas. The\nthe fund is about to was going to expire\nin 2030 and that's starting to to limit\nthe ability of some of these companies\nto get financing and to continue to\nprovide service. Um so we the initial\nbill proposed to um remove what is\neffectively a sunset and also allow\ncompanies to opt into the program if\nthey desire to do so. A number of\nconcerns and the bill did pass by\noverwhelming majority out of energy\nutilities and telecommunications but\nthere were some concerns expressed uh\nthat we finally were able to to sort of\nget specific uh input on. And so we're\ndoing five things in this substitute.\nFirst, we we had originally removed the\nsunset altogether. Now, we're just\nbacking it up another effectively 10\nyears to December 31, 2040. Second,\nwe're limiting the tier 2 providers, and\nit already was limited to smaller phone\ncompanies, but we're further limiting it\nto in the in the substitute uh limiting\nthose providers that can opt in by\nAugust one of this year based on certain\ncriteria. We're also imposing a $50\nmillion annual cap on the dispersements.\nWe're requiring that audits be\nsubmitted. The PSC already requires it,\nbut we're making it part of the statute.\nAnd we're requiring PSC to submit a\nbianial report on the fund because there\nhave been a number of questions about\nhow much money is in the fund, how many\npeople pay in, how many people get\ndispersed. So, we're we're trying to\nprovide that information and report that\nwe provided to the governor, lieutenant\ngovernor, and the speaker. Uh, and that,\nMr. Chairman, is the uh is the\nsubstitute, and I would ask the\ncommittee's favorable consideration of\napproving that substitute.\n>> Okay. You've heard the explanation. Any\nquestions?\nOkay, I don't see any. Do I hear a\nmotion do pass from the rules committee?\n>> Have a motion and a second. Any\nopposition? Okay, it it moves forward\nwith a do pass recommendation.\nOkay.\nAll right. Now let's set the calendar\nfor Thursday to be day 18\nunder modified open\nbe house resolution\n999.\n>> Have a move and second. Is there any\nopposition?\nIt's on.\nOkay. under modified structure\nhouse bill 998 by rule substitute that's\nLC 56 0570s\n>> second\n>> have moved and second is there any\nopposition\nit's on\nhouse bill 810\n>> moved and seconded\nI will not be here tomorrow during\nsession. I've got a doctor's\nappointment. Can we do it on Monday?\nPossibly.\n>> We won't be here Monday.\n>> Oh, that's right. Tuesday,\n>> please. Thank you.\n>> All right.\nThat's 810, right?\n>> Okay. Hold up on that.\nHouse Bill 948.\n>> Have a move and second. Any opposition?\nIt's on. Okay.\nHouse Bill 983\n>> moved and seconded. Any opposition?\nIt's on.\nSenate bill. Senate bill 195\nmoved and seconded. Any opposition?\nIt's on. Okay. That sets our calendar\nfor Thursday.\nWe will not meet in the morning at 9:00.\nWe will not have a rules meeting in the\nmorning. We will meet Tuesday morning.\nSo, watch for your emails on that. Thank\nyou. We're ajourned.",
