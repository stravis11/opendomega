I met them through Camp 151 which is a service\norganization that serves the underserved in our community for a week and he is\nthe leader of that. He navigated us out of Hurricane Helene. Please make him\nand welcome this morning Pastor Paul Elliott.\nThank you.\nApplause.\nGood morning, everyone.\nI'd like to thank you, Mr. Speaker, for this amazing opportunity to share a Christian word\nof encouragement to an assembly such as this with the leaders of our great state.\nI'd also like to thank my representative\nfrom House District 169, Mrs. Angie Osteen,\nfor the blessing of being nominated for such an occasion.\nI'd also like to recognize James Bershiat from 176,\nwho's got the Southwestern Quadrant of Copy County,\nso appreciate your service as well.\nAnd Angie, I thank you for your friendship.\nI'd also like to thank my lovely and kind\nand long-suffering bride, Claire Mealy-Eliott,\nwho is representing our family today\nwith Sam and Caroline, my niece and nephew.\nYou already know that I love you all.\nLastly, I'm honored, truly, to be\nin the presence of the representative leadership of my state.\nWithout your willingness to conduct the necessary labor\nof legislation and vision casting in real time,\nnothing would happen in our towns and cities,\ncounties or roadways, and I salute you all.\nMany of you remember Chuck Sims\nfrom his time and service in this room\nis the representative for District 169 in Coffee County.\nHe is also a prominent funeral director in Douglass\nand unfortunately in the last two weeks,\nI've been working with him quite a bit\ndo to some deaths in our church.\nAnd we were talking the other day,\nand I was telling them about this wonderful opportunity\nthat I had to be with you all today,\nand that I was given a five-minute time limit\nwith which to deliver my message.\nAnd Chuck, without even missing a beat,\nsaid, do not worry about that five-minute time limit too much\nbecause in truth, nobody really wants to get started\nwith the order of business of the day anyway.\nThat's his words.\nThank you.\nToday's scripture is from the Apostle Paul and his epistle to the church in Philippi.\nIn chapter 2 we find these words, if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort\nfrom love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy, complete my joy\nby being of the same mind, having the same love,\nbeing in full accord and of one mind.\nDo nothing from selfish ambition or conceit,\nbut in humility count others more significant than yourselves.\nLet each of you look not only to his own interests,\nbut also to the interests of others.\nHave this mind among yourselves,\nwhich is yours in Christ Jesus,\nwho though he was in the form of God,\ndid not count equality with God a thing to be grasped,\nbut impede himself by taking the form of a servant\nbeing born in the likeness of men.\nThe great and noble General George Washington\nafter leading the continental army to victory\nover British forces in the American Revolution\nelected to resign his commission and return\nto his comfortable home at Mount Vernon.\nMany of his contemporaries felt\nthat because of his widespread popularity,\nas savior of the colonies from King George III,\nthat he could easily seize power unopposed.\nBut he felt that he could best serve his new country\nby putting aside power, investing it with the people\nfor them to decide.\nUpon hearing about this about George Washington,\nKing George III in England is quoted as\ncalling George Washington the greatest man in the world\nfor having given up that power.\nSoon enough, he would be called forth from the comforts\nof his farm into public service again,\nfirst to preside over the Continental Congress,\nand then to preside over two terms\nas the United States First President.\nOnce again, many felt that he could easily retain power\nby not departing office, but he knew he could best serve\nhis country by stepping aside as his season of service\nhad come to an end.\nMany of you here today are absent from your homes\nand from your families, from your places of employment,\nyour businesses, your farms, even your cats and dogs.\nYour paths here to this moment that we're all sharing\nare as diverse as you all are,\nand each of you has his or her own story.\nMaybe you were asked to run for the office\nthat you now occupy.\nMaybe it was expected of you to run through office.\nMaybe it runs in the family.\nMaybe you had an ambitious streak\nand you wanted to defeat your opponent in a fair contest.\nYou can't play football anymore\nso why not duke it out on the field of political battle.\nWhatever led you here,\nwhatever brought you here is not the point.\nI often reflect with my church family\nthat the moment, this moment,\nthat we're all sharing has never been lived before.\nWe're all sharing this together for the first time\nand anything is possible with each passing moment.\nWith the examples of our Lord and Savior,\nJesus Christ, as well as our first president,\nwe can see that power is rightly viewed as an instrument\nwhich can be used for tremendous good.\nThe power of your positions, ladies and gentlemen,\nimpact the people of this state in ways\nthat many of them will never know.\nIn fact, you can go as far as to say\nthat they are helpless against whatever decisions\nthat are made and the legislation that flows from them.\nIt's important that we all take it seriously\nand I trust you all to do just that.\nI also recognize that many of you could be enjoying\nthe fruits of your labor at your homes\nor on a trip somewhere exotic, perhaps.\nBut you're here.\nYou're getting ready to do the work on behalf of 11.2 million\nGeorgians and the work you do matters and it matters to me.\nLike the example of Jesus and of General Washington, you don't see this as a\nposition of superiority, but as a position of service.\nI encourage you to remember to reflect the glory of God and all that you do,\nboth today in this working session and in the lives the Lord has blessed us with.\nNow I'd invite you to please stand as we pray.\nFather, we are so grateful for this day,\nthis beautiful day that you've blessed us with.\nI'm so grateful for each and every individual\nthat is here today in the areas that they represent\nfrom our great state.\nI ask that you pour abundant blessing upon them\nand those people that they represent,\ntheir families, their futures.\nWe're grateful to be here, Lord.\nWe're grateful for the life that you have blessed us with.\nHelp us to not waste one minute of it.\nAnd it's in Christ's name, we pray.\nAmen.\nI invite you now to join me in pledging allegiance\nto our great flag.\nI pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America\nand to the Republic for which it stands.\nOne nation under God, individual, with liberty\nand justice for all.\nThank you for being here with us and family. Thank y'all for being here. Thank you for your service to our country and thank you for your service as a good lord in your community and all of those you minister too. Thank you for being here with us.\nour country and thank you for your service as a good lord in your community and all of\nthose you minister too.\nThank you for being here today.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nWe think Representative Scott Holcomb, we're inviting our doctor of the day today\nThat's Dr. Steven Holbrook.\nThanks Dr. Holbrook for being here and taking care of all those folks who serve on this golden dome.\nThank you Dr. Holbrook, we appreciate your service.\nChair now recognizes Chairman Hilton, the Chair of the Committee on Information and Audits.\nChairman Hilton.\nGood morning Mr. Speaker, happy Friday.\nYour committee on information and audits has read the journal of the previous legislative\nday and found it to be correct.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nChairman Hilton, the chair of the committee on information and audits reports that the\njournal of the previous legislative day has been read and found to be correct.\nIs there any objection to dispense with the reading of the journal?\nHearing none the journal reading the journal is dispensed with.\nIs there any objection to the confirmation of the journal?\nChair, here's none that the journal is confirmed.\nMr. Clerk, will you read the resolution establishing the order of business for the day?\nRepresentative, administration of 104th moves following me establishes the first part of the period unanimous\nconsents, introduction of bills and resolutions, first reading and reference of house bills and resolutions,\nsecond reading of bills and resolutions, reports of standing committees, morning orders.\nIs there any objection to the adoption of the resolution establishing the order of business for the day?\nHearing none, the resolution is adopted.\nFirst, reading the bills and resolutions, Mr. Clerk, will you read?\nHousehold 979 by Representative Honolulu 73rd Smith of the 18th Ballot of the 147 Hong\n113rd, Holcomb of the 101st, Bill Meetal and Acto Men Code Section 52, 27th of the\nMr. Clerk, I'm going to assign this bill, and then I want to pause for just for a second.\nJudiciary, members, if any of you found a cell phone in the ladies' restroom,\nis representing Bayes Moors.\nIt's missing.\nIt'd be nice to get it back to her.\nThank you very much.\nMr. Clerk.\nHouse Bill 980 by Rips on a bond of the 73rd.\nStevenson 164th, Beatrie of the 166th,\nProvers of the 52nd.\nTran of the 80th and others,\nthere'll be Todd and Act to amend chapter 12,\nbut Toddle 50, the Fisher go to Georgia,\nand it's either relating to commissions\nand other agencies.\nEconomic development, enterism.\nHouse Bill 981 by reps and Apollo 33rd,\nairheart of 36,\nI've sneed into 169 Jackson,\n128th and Jones, 47th.\nBill B.

Never let your love dissipate and just keep\nkeeping on and I'll see you at the pearly gate. Thank you my friends for listening to\nthat. Her name was Cheryl P. Fry. May God bless her and I'm going to see her at the\nto pearly gates.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker, and I yield the well.\nWe're up to you, Fry.\nYou know what I know.\nWe only have one mama, and they're

lived a life of distinction\ndefined by exemplary service to his state, devotion\nto his community, and steadfast commitment\nto education, agriculture, and civic leadership.\nAnd whereas starting from his earliest visits\nto the Georgia State Capitol in the 1940s,\nhe developed a lifelong connection to the Georgia's public life\nthat led him to serve as executive secretary\nto Attorney General Jean Cook and to be appointed by Governor-elect Ernest Vandiver as director\nof the Department of Commerce during which time he created the state's first tourist\ndivision as well as the state's first welcome station in Screven County, the oldest station\nstill operational in the United States.\nAnd whereas his career began most closely tied to Georgia's agriculture through his leadership\nbut the Georgia Poultry Federation,\nwhere he guided the industry's growth with vision and dedication,\nand he continued to serve full time as President Emeritus there after.\nAnd whereas his passion for education in the University of Georgia was evident\nin his service as President of the UGA Alumni Association,\nand as Trustee of the UGA Foundation,\nand as a leader in preserving the historic four towers\nand establishing the Veterinary Medicine Experiment Station.\nAnd whereas as many honors include the UGA Distinguished\nAlumni Merit Award, the Blue Key Service Award,\nthe inaugural medallion

certainly will be recognized.\nMembers, any of us could do what I'm doing right now that had the honor and the\npleasure of knowing Mr. Abbott and working with him over the years. And I'm going to\nmake some more remarks about Mr. Abbott, but I want to invite his son, Lewis,\nAll of you know as well to introduce the family, Lewis, if you will, and allow me to present\nyou with this resolution, members of this house, we're also proud to be a part of and present\nto you and the family as we honor a dear, dear Georgian, the Stab at Massey, Lewis.\nHow'd you know?\nThank you.\nLewis, can I have more\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\nplease please be seated they don't listen to me very well thank you speaker\nJohn Burns thank you Dale Burns the real star of the Burns family thanks to\neach of you for your service to the state and for the time that you work with\nmy dad over the years greatly appreciated I want to thank the speaker staff\nChris and Jacob and others who helped make this resolution possible and thank\nmany friends in the gallery who worked with Dad over the years here at the\nState Capitol. I want to just say a couple of brief things. Number one is he loved\nthe State Capitol and he loved this state. He told me that in the early 1940s he got\nin the car with one of his older brothers and they drove to the State Capitol\nand he met John P. Wilson, who was the 20th Secretary of State of Georgia.\nAnd then in 1947, when he was a student at UGA, he got in a car with three other students\nand they drove here to observe firsthand the chaos around the three governors controversy\nthat so many of you have read about, 1947.\nAnd as mentioned by the clerk and the resolution,\ndad had offices here at the State Capitol.\nIn the 50s, he worked for the Attorney General.\nHe worked in what was the predecessor\nto the Legislative Council's office, drafting bills.\nHe said there are only two people in the office at the time.\nA lot less bills then, I guess.\nHe also worked for a judge on the Court of Appeals.\nAnd many of you know that room 341 was actually\ncourtroom for the Georgia Court of Appeals and the Georgia Supreme Court in the 50s.\nAnd then in the late 50s he got to be the commissioner of the Department of Commerce, which is\nnow the Department of Economic Development. And in that job, he had one major victory.\nHe met Miss Georgia in 1959, who became his wife and our beloved mother and grandmother.\nHis dad once said that if Abbott ever fell in a lake, one thing for sure, he would come\nout of there with a fish in his pocket.\nDad did live a wonderful, fortunate, lucky life.\nAnd we are here today to thank you for this recognition.\nMy wife Amy is here, our son Christian, our son Chandler and his fiancee Steph Bennett,\nAnd the speaker recognized Mike Giles earlier who worked with Dad for many years at the Georgia\npoultry federation as they lobbied on behalf of the poultry industry.\nLet me finish with this.\nIf you read Dad's bio, it says he has an undergraduate degree from UGA and a law degree from Emory.\nBut I think his most important degree was a PhD in joy.\nEvery single day he was at this Capitol, he was joyful.\nAnd his legacy will live on thanks to you and others at the State Capitol.\nThank you for letting us be here today and share in recognizing and honoring the life of\nAbbott Massey.\nThank you very much.\nI know many, many of you, y'all may be seated, many, many of you, these members and great\nGeorgians in your own right would like to come and express your sentiment about\nMr. Abbott Massey. And thank you to his friends in the gallery too. We appreciate\ny'all being here to honor Mr. Abbott as we will. Because we all know that Mr. Abbott\nwas a trusted friend, mentor, advisor in so many different ways to so many\npeople over the years that served in the, with the honor that we serve with as\nmembers of the General Assembly, especially members of the House.\nAnd I thought of it this way, as Deilin and I have talked, I think I believe that the\ngood Lord has a plan.\nHis plan for Mr. Abbott was long life, good health, because he impacted so many of us with\nhis attitude and just that enthusiasm that he, I think he embodied it all.\nEveryone he met came away with, boy, I feel better to talk on that guy.\nAnd I think we all try to, he was a true Southern gentleman.\nIf you look it up in the book, the dictionary probably has Abbott Massie's name there.\nPersonal story about Mr. Abbott and his longevity.\nBut I was looking through some old newspapers at home\nfrom the Springfield Herald in 1956 or 57.\nOn the front page was this group establishing\nthe J.C.'s Jung People Google it, the Georgia J.C.'s,\nthe J.C.'s and who was inducting and establishing\nthat new chapter down in Effingham County,\nMr. Abbott mass, you know, and guess what?\nOne thing, he may have looked a little bit older,\nbut one thing was the same.\nThat hair was perfect then, and it was perfect now.\nSo he's pasted that gift alone, and I'll go in and tell y'all,\nI'm gonna get a haircut this week,\nbut I've got this hair in honor of Mr. Abbott this week,\ntrying to emulate Mr. Abbott in every sense of the word.\nSo that was something that was special to me,\nand Mr. Abbott just had that big grin\nwhen I gave him that newspaper, that first trip,\nthe history of our state that he would talk to you about.\nAnd he would bring the life for you\nas he told you about our state and our successes\nand everything he had been a part of\nand what he witnessed.\nLouis just spoke to that.\nA fixture, a fixture, that guy has been a fixture\nin this capital for a couple of years.\nAnd he's made a difference in here.\nMiss Kayanne, what a beautiful, beautiful Miss Georgia.\nShe was, what a beautiful, beautiful lady.\nShe was during her entire life.\nAnd a graduate of Agnes Scott, and you all know that.\nI just realized that.\nY'all know where they went on the first date.\nTrivia, Niagara Falls.\nYes, they did.\nWith her mother sitting in the back seat of the car, of course.\nWhat a romantic Mr. Abbott was.\nYou know, another special thing for me,\nas we've done in Scriven County on US 301,\nthe longest established welcome center in our country,\nis in Scriven County in our state.\nAnd Mr. Abbott was always an advocate\nfor keeping that beautiful building,\nhistoric building in place,\nand also is that welcome center still serves.\nVisitors coming from South Carolina,\ngoing south on 301 and headed back home in our state.\nFor those University of Georgia friends here, and I think we all are, he did bleed red\nand black.\nThere's no doubt about that.\nI don't think anything happened in Athens that Mr. Abbott was not a part of.\nWould that be fair to say?\nIn so many different ways.\nI think about that longevity and that help that the good Lord blessed Mr. Abbott with.\nHe called me a few years ago and said, hey, are you coming to the ball game?\nIt was one spring morning.\nHe said, what ball game is to have it?\nHe said, if it him, Kennedy, they're playing Gainesville right now in baseball.\nHe was always there in every sense of the word for what we do here, but what his community\nwas all about.\nAnd I did wear an elephant paper for the Gainesville folks up there that he cared so much about.\nI thought this was interesting, y'all probably heard this, your mother told him said,\nAbbot, when he was going to work for the Georgia Poetry Federation in 1966, he said, Abbot,\nyou don't know the difference, we're not gonna chicken, how can you do that?\nHe learned pretty fast, he did a great job of being responsible for the great success of\nthat industry.\nIt's so crucial to our state and the well-being of so many families around all over our\nstate, not just in North East Georgia. One of the things that I try to emulate, and\nI know you all do too, is, you know, I like to know people's names. Mr. Abbott knew\nyour name. He could call your name when you met him. That's one of the things that\nwas always so special about him, and he wanted to know about you. He wouldn't\nknow about your family, where you came from, what you did, but it wasn't\nforgotten because the next time he spoke to him he remembered and he talked to you about\nthings that were important to you. We should all try to emulate that as we make people feel\nspecial because he did that. Now he had a special friendship, he had a special friend\nsitting right over to my right, Dale Burns and you know Mr. Abbott was constantly upgrading\nand his ability to be in touch with every day.\nDrummer Tesla, a red Tesla.\nHe had an Apple watch.\nSo I can hear him right now, the phone would ring her.\nI said, who are you talking to?\nI'm calling Mr. Abbott.\nThey were comparing steps.\nWho got the most steps in that day.\nAnd so he'd be here most of the time.\nI can tell you that.\nBut she really thought she was one of his special girlfriends.\nShe got to look in and listening.\nMr. Heaven had a lot of special girlfriends.\nShe was special to him, but she realized\nhow special all of us were to Mr. Abbott.\nHe calls, you know what he did?\nHe cared about people.\nHe cared about his neighbor.\nHe kept up with the times.\nHe did that.\nHe was always relevant, always relevant.\nTo the family, thank you for sharing your dad,\nA man especially in your life, as you join the family,\ngrandchildren, he was so very, very proud of you all,\ny'all know that, and you all have that great hair\nthat Mr. Abbott passed on, that gene is still alive.\nI think Mr. Abbott's life and legacy, and that's important.\nWe've talked a little bit, a little bit about legacy\nover the last few days.\nThere's a legacy of kindness to every Georgian he came in contact with,\nto the point they remember him well,\nthat care he had for our state, for our well-being,\nfrom an economic perspective, but from a personal perspective.\nHe will never be lost on me.\nAnd his devotion, his devotion to this state,\nbut to his family, and just fellow men.\nI'll just say this.\nThank God for the life of that fine, fine man right there,\nMr. Abbott-Massie.\nThank you, family.\nWe love you.\nWe, again, thank the Lord for Mr. Abbott-Massie.\nThank you for being here with us,\nand letting us honor this family.\nThank you, members.\nyou\nThank you.\nOkay.\nI'll just let you know, Ms. Babis.\nLewis is obviously his son, Camillo is his daughter.\nThey were traveling, they tried to get here,\nbut as we honored their dad,\nbut we certainly make sure they can watch us for it.\nAnd I think they'll be, thank y'all.\nMembers, if you would,\nwe all learn to go into the end of the room.\nMembers, if you would like to speak to the family,\nyou may join them in the south any room\nand have a photo and tell them of your high regard\nof Mr. Abbott-Massie.\nThank you.\nWe have a little bit of business I need to attend to, but before we move on to afternoon orders.\nWe have a motion to withdraw a bill from one committee and recommit to another.\nFor what purpose is reps any forward rise?\nThat's Mr. Speaker, that you want to make a motion?\nYes, sir.\nThe lady's recognized for a motion.\nThat we move House Bill 590 from the Committee on Regulated Industries to the Committee on Motor Vehicles and both Chairman and Agreement.\nThank you.\nMr. Clerk, will you read the caption?\nHouse Bill 590 by reps and a quarter of the 170th and others to be entitled back to a men's title 43.\nThe official go to Georgia, Antietta, relating to professions and businesses so as to provide for the regulation of trailer manufacturers.\nOn the latest motion, HB590, be withdrawn from the Regulated Industries Committee and\nrecommitted to Motor Vehicles Committee, is the objection, hearing none of this so ordered.\nWe have some afternoon orders, we want to call on Chairman Bonner, then Representative\nPantitch and Martinez representing Bayes Moore and chairman MacDonald. We'll start with chairman Bonner\nYou don't have a time limit. We will let you conscious be your guide. How about that?\nI'd rather you be my guide mr. Speaker\nHey, uh, good morning. Come on. We'll spin\nThis is a good one. It's been pending for a few days. We're glad it's finally accomplished. Mr. Chairman\nWell, thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today, I rise to honor and celebrate a great Georgian and a true American hero.\nEarlier this week, General Tom Cardin, our former adjutant general, was nominated to be the vice chief of the National Guard Bureau.\nThis is the culmination of an incredible career that saw General Cardin go from enlisting as a private in the Georgia National Guard in high school\nto now pinning on a fourth-star reaching the highest level in the United States\nmilitary. So General Cardin, as I said, served as our\nagit in general throughout his career here in Georgia. He was a friend to many of us.\nHe led troops into harm's way. He led our state through numerous natural\ndisasters and throughout the and throughout the COVID pandemic, his actions\nsaved countless lives here in Georgia. So we are so honored and excited to have\nGeneral Cardin become the only the second serving four-star general in the\nNational Guard. He'll be up the National Guard Bureau in in Washington. He'll be an\nadvocate for not only for Georgia but for all of us in the military and I think\nit's fitting that we celebrate him today and look forward to his continued\nservice. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representative Bonner. Yeah, absolutely.\nMembers, if you will reflect back with me on those days, on those Governor Kemp's press conferences\non COVID and bringing information to Georgians, boy, he was really good and did a great job\nin making sure that he did his job protected and working to serve Georgians. So, congratulations,\nthe general. He's a good man and I'm really glad he's on our team. Represent\nPennage and Representative Martinez.
