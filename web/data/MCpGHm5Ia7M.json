being awarded in\ndifferent ways in our state from the\nbench and without getting to too many of\nthe Weeds on this you have the\ndependency cases with the whole process\nset up after a child is awarded to the\nstate you have Chin's cases and you have\ndelinquency cases and there's a law\nyou'll see in section one of the bill\nthat deals with dual designation where\nwe have the authority to find a child\ndependent and these are two types of\ncases the problem is the law doesn't say\nwhat happens next and so what we did\nwith this bill if you remember when I\npresented it which you probably don't\npresented the first time there was some\nconcern we have from juvenile court\njudges and and I committed this body to\nkeep working on the language to make\nsure we still had some

tell you a lot of work\nwent to this we've got a lot of work in\nthe house side the changes you'll see in\nfront of you is just taking the current\nversion and trying to get more\nflexibility to The

custody is\nbeing awarded to the state from the\nbench but at the same time it's also\ngoing to make sure we do everything we\ncan to bring defects to the table in\nthese cases so we're not just

the disabilities that you see\nwith veterans are physical\nthose with a a more mental based\ndisability\nare still authorized to have the tag but\nit causes a lot of consternation for\nthem\nwhen they look a seemingly physically\nfit individual gets out of a car with a\nhandicap tag this lets them wave the ad\nvalarm just like they would if they had\nthe tag but does not require them to put\nthe

the\nGadsden flag and as I tried to push this\nforward found out that our state was a\nlittle too regulated in the sense that\nwe couldn't put the logo in the center\nof the tag\nso this amendment also changes the code\nsection to whatever your Livery is or\nyour logo is on a future vanity plate\nyou not only have the ability to put it\non the left side but you now can put it\nin the middle or

I'm reading both your\nAmendment four and five do you realize\nan amendment four that you're going to\neliminate the special license plate for\nU.S senator Congress Governor lieutenant\ngovernor uh no sir that's not the case I\nthink that you're talking about I'm\nlooking at it\num line 13 says a commissioner shall be\nlocated the left Center or the right\nportion of the license plate\nso I don't I don't think you're looking\nat Senator can I ask you for another\nquestion yes sir I think you need to\nlook at the Senate substitute\num which is LC\n393873 you're asking to replace line 13\nand line 13 is the beginning of code\nsection\n40-2-16\nif you look at amendment five when it\ncomes to section two said article is\nfurther amended related to the plates of\nU.S senators\num so no it doesn't doesn't change that\nokay Senator will you further yield yes\nsir sen are you aware there's a process\nwhen you want to get a new license plate\ndeveloped that you work with the\nDepartment of Revenue and the committee\nto begin that process yes sir uh we did\nwork with that but like I said earlier I\nfound out that they're a little too\nregulated\num so that's what this amendment does is\nit it clarifies it's one of those what\nwe call cleanup bills and it allows the\nlogo to be in the center or to the right\nside Senator isn't it true that I would\nbe happy to work with you on a real bill\ngo through the process on this next year\nbut these are probably out of order\nbased on where we are right now without\nfollowing the process and I think you've\ngot some unintended consequences here uh\nrespectfully disagree Senator I think\nthis is an amendment for freedom and I\nhope you'll vote for it as you support\nFreedom uh I do in either way I'll yield\nthe well Mr President Senator

are done in an\norderly way uh I think well I very much\nrespect uh my colleague who is seeking\nto amend uh with four and five uh part\nof it is amended inaccurately and will\nprobably cause some unintended\nConsequence the rest of the bill and the\nsecond one again did not follow the\nprocess so I think it's important we\nvote for the bill and Amendment one two\nand three and I will commit to

federal government\nactually passed their own that we were\nwaiting on for many years and the other\nthing that happens is the erisa plans\nthe Supreme Court in 2017 said that the\nstate could not regulate those so some\nof them are riska plan some of them are\nState plans\nsince then we've had a problem where\nmaybe they weren't all identified which\nwas it I think Blue Cross has actually\ndone a really fine job of identifying\nthose forests not everybody has has\ngotten that right so this is they have\nto identify it the second thing is that\nthe insurance commissioner has asked\nthat we changed some of those from 15\ndays to 30 days and some of those from\n30 days to 60 days to help them out and\nwe've agreed to that\nand then the third thing that's in there\nis a penalty we've had one Hospital\ngroup\nyou can probably guess which one it is\nthat has clogged the system up with\nwith uh\nasking for Corrections on surprise bills\nwithout providing any data any follow-up\nand so this was done in the fall before\nall this happened but\nthe bill now says that that if you do\nthat the insurance commissioner can give\nyou two thousand dollar fine\nand if you do it knowingly they can give\na five thousand dollar fine so that\npeople aren't\nascending frivolous claims in it again\nthere's only one Hospital group that's\nbeen doing that those are three

Mr President\ncolleagues before you you have the\nSenate Bill House Bill and everything is\nconfused but the reality of it is just\nlook for 196 house bill 196. let me tell\nyou about this bill so you know what\nyou'll be voting on and make sure we get\nit right\nHouse Bill 196 is two bills in one house\nbill is the medical cannabis bill and\nhouse bill on page 40 is the hemp bill\nthat we tried to get past of this\nchamber that we just got some confusion\non let me tell you what's going on so\nyou'll know\nthe house bill 196 addresses the medical\ncannabis issue in this state to approach\nand move the medical cannabis beyond the\nbroken promises that we've been giving\npeople\nis a vehicle to settle to pending legal\nactions and fulfill it as soon as\npractical and deliver the medicine to\nthe citizens of Georgia which is\ncurtailed the suffering on a daily basis\nlet me tell you what this bill does as\nwe follow through it I'm going to hit\nthe high point so we'll know where we're\ntalking about\nit abolishes the Cannabis commission and\ntransfers the function to the\nagriculture department where the\nresponsibility of an elected official\nwho is accountable to the people of this\nstate can administer this program and\nopen and transparent manner let me say\nthis right now we have no control over\nthe Cannabis commission we give them a\nmillion plus dollars and they answer to\nno one\nI want to put this we want to put this\nto the agriculture Department the\ncommission of Agriculture who is elected\nby the state of people who we know will\nbe transparent number two\nthe division of the agriculture\ndepartment will be subject to the\nadministrators the procedures act and\nopen records acts no more secrecy when\nit comes to business no more secrecy an\nunelected bureaucracy\nnumber three appeals from the decision\nof this Administration agency will be\nmade to the Georgia Statewide business\ncourt that means it moves fast and gets\ndone\na license will be available to have\nadditional transparency at the\nproduction facility that means a\nlicensee can have a license to sell the\nstuff at the place where they make the\ndarn stuff\na dispensary can sell it and any other\nlicensed facilities product at its\ndispensary this will help the retail\nNetwork for our patients and our\nconstituents a joint and robust\noversight committee is established\ninvolving many members of various House\nand Senate committees\nthe agriculture commissioner will\nmediate with nine companies that have\nprotested and are currently litigating\nwhich has been held up for about four\nand a half in the center Senator Senator\nJohn Paul's ladies and gentlemen ladies\nand gentlemen\nI need your attention we have a senator\nin the well right now and he is\naddressing a pretty serious matter I\nneed your attention all authorized\nPersonnel we need you to exit the\nchamber hate to be like this but I've\nasked you multiple times now\nsenator\nfloor is yours\nI'll start back on my seventh\nseventh uh note the agriculture will\nmediate with nine with the nine\ncompanies that have protested and are\ncurrently litigating with the with the\nGeorgia medical cannabis commission the\ncommissioner would be authorized but not\nobligated and repeat that not obligated\nto addition additional to issue\nadditional licenses as a resolution to\nthis mediation if that occurs\nlitigations will be dropped\nthis has been going on four and a half\nyears folks I didn't even get here when\nthis started happening\nthe commit number eight the commission\nwill also have the discretion but not\nthe obligation to it to issue additional\nlicenses as organic growth in the\nregistry occurs the maximum number of\nlicense that a commissioner could issue\nwould be maxed out at 20 which I promise\nyou we won't get there but he got a Max\nof 20. which will be compared to other\nstates is far lower than any other\nstates with licensed numbers but again\nthe commissioner is not required to give\none more license not one more license\nnumber nine the vesting of the of the\ndiscretion of the agriculture\ncommissioner will allow him and his team\nand experts to ensure a healthy and fair\nmarket which brings this much needed\nmedication to all the Georgia Citizens\nand keeps it affordable it ensures that\nGeorgia's small business now hear me now\nincluding minority-owned businesses are\nnot left out in the cold and they're not\nforced to close their doors with all the\nstringent rules and regulations and let\nme tell you something folks the hemp\nbill goes on and says you got to be 21\nyears and older to buy this stuff now\nright now any number whether you're 8 10\n12 14 or 15 you can walk in and buy it\nwe're going to put it on there where you\ndo not have you have to be 21 years or\nolder to buy this material hear me on\nthis\nwe need controls of this industry\nwe need controls this gives us the\ncontrols that we need it outlines all\nthe the the medications in here it\noutlies all the things that we can treat\nin here and what it can be transferred\nto this bill is a solid bill that came\nover from the house and I think it only\nonly fell by like 13 votes over there\nit's a solid bill that moves this state\nforward folks we have been promising\nfolks medical cannabis since I don't\nknow how long\nit is time for us to get off the pot and\ndeliver and it's time for us to have a\ncommissioned a an agriculture Mission\ntake it away from a commission that\ndoesn't answer to us we're putting the\nmoney in and we have absolutely no say\nso in this business\nwe need to make a change and I will tell\nyou this last condition is is you know\nwe have got to make sure that when we do\nthese things here we do these things the\ncorrect way other states have done this\nthey are succeeding in their message and\nthey're getting their medication to\npeople there is no reason Georgia can't\nbe as effective I ask you to please\nvote for this bill pass this bill move\nthis forward if we need to tweak this\nbill I will gladly be the one sitting up\nhere and tell you we need to tweak this\nbill gladly and I will do whatever it\ntakes to make sure we get it right but\nlet me tell you one more thing this\nwould have been handled a while back but\nour previous agriculture commissioner\nwanted nothing to do with it and we had\nabsolutely nowhere to go with it that's\nwhere the Cannabis commission came in\nnow we have an agriculture bear who's\none of our own\nwho's willing to take this on put the\npeople in place fix it make it happen\nand deliver on a promise\nladies and gentlemen I'll live with it\nwell I'll ask no question I know we're\ntired I know it's long night I know the\nbills long can't have time to go through\nit but I'm asking you to vote green to\npass this bill Mr President no question\nI yield well you do have some questions\nSenator yes sir recognize senator from\nthe 45th\nMr President I was just wanting to\nexcuse the senator from the 48 that the\nappropriate\nthat sounded good to me Paul\nall right well no objection I think he'd\nbe excused uh recognize senator from the\n29th\nSenator Yale\nyes sir\nSenator did I hear you say that this\nbill expands the opportunity for more\nlicenses in Georgia yes sir I said it it\ngives the agriculture commissioner there\nability to expand it up to 20 licenses\nbut he does not have to issue one more\nlicense if our registry does not grow\nso Senator why would we not wait to see\nif our registry grow grows any before we\nwould expand this I'll assure you he\nwill wait and do it but I will say this\nto you Senator we only have like 25 to\n27 000 people on the restroom right now\nbecause we have been promising people\nfor four or five years to let them get\nthis medication the moment this is\navailable I'll assure you that registry\nis going to jump up probably into\nhundreds of thousands if not close to a\nmillion or more is it not true the\nsenator continue Senators is it not true\nthat once we make anything available\nthat people are going to line up to get\nit because I do believe Senator and\ncorrect me if I'm wrong that when we\nfirst passed this legislation we had a\nlimited number of conditions that this\nproduct could be used for and there have\nbeen many attempts to expand those\nconditions uh is that not true Senator I\nwas not here when y'all first passed\nthis four and a half years ago I can't\nspeak to that\nSenator the senator yield for one last\nquestion yes sir Senator do you know how\nmany Georgians could be treated by 20\nlicensees well as you well know we've\nsaid at many committee meetings you\nwe've heard various numbers on that I'll\nassure you this right here from what I\nknow about the industry it will take\nmore than the four or five licenses that\nwe have available in Georgia under the\ncurrent law that we passed to treat\nwhat's going on because these folks Mr\nsenator they are not ready to produce\nmedical marijuana because of what it\ntakes to get it to the point from start\nto finish to fruition and right now we\nneed other people in this and and we\ndon't need to have to let maybe just\nfour or five people monopolize this four\nor five companies and most of those\ncompanies except one that I know of are\nfrom Canada and from out of state this\nis Georgia grown stuff I'm trying to\nwork with\nthank you Senator thank you\nMr President request\nyou have one one last question uh\nsenators from the 19th\nthank you Mr President Senator my good\nfriend to you yield appropriation\nchairman absolutely Senator you know I\nhad a lot of respect for you and I\nappreciate what you're trying to do for\nSouth Georgia but how many new licenses\ncould there be so I'm sorry how many new\nlicenses could this bill allow it will\nallow up to 20 total not new license but\nup 220. but let me repeat again the\nAgriculture Commission not has to issue\na license not a new license I thought I\nheard you say that well the senator\nfurther you go so the agricultural\ncommissioner would have sole discretion\nas to whether or not to issue a new\nlicense his board with Senators on the\nboard with Representatives on the board\nand members on the board\nthat's how the agriculture is going to\nset it up\nsenator I I guess I won't speak to it I\nsay the reason that I can't support your\nbill your as agree as amended is because\nI think putting that much power with one\nperson is just\nyou would only do that if you don't\nreally care about them because the even\nthe power that we've had levied on us\nabout gambling in here marijuana and\ncannabis is going to be 10 times that\nand that power I just\nI am too good of friends and respect the\nagriculture commissioner enough to put\nthat type of power in such a small few\nhands I I can't do that to him Mr\nchairman I will respond to that by\ntelling you this right now we have the\npower of resting in a cannabis\ncommission that we have absolutely no\ncontrol over we don't know they don't\nanswer to us they don't return calls\nthey don't do anything and you're as an\nappropriate Champion are appropriate\nmoney to a cannabis commission that we\nhave absolutely no say-so in I think\nthat's ludicrous\nSenator you have a few more questions\nthat you're welcome to yield the well\nlet's vote on Mr go ahead\nwhatever I'll take another one\nall right senator from the 39th\nSenator do you yield\nyes ma'am\nso it seems to me that we keep coming\nback to this question of\nthe competitive bids from way back when\nwe now have two licenses that have been\nissued to production correct\nand I see in here in lines 738 through\n741 going back to the fact that the AG\ncommissioner if this bill passes would\nhave sole discretion to not just\nprovide new licenses but actually engage\nin mediation with the applicants that\nparticipated in the original competitive\napplications process\nin a normal competitive bidding process\nis it not true that you win or you lose\nyou can sue and then whatever happens\nwith that which lawsuits are in process\nright now then you either win it or you\ndon't but you don't then get to come to\nthe front of the line ahead of everybody\nelse when you lost a process\nCenter knows of what she speaks and I\nwill I will expand on that by the way\nunder this license the way this bill is\nwritten if we negotiate with the ones\nthat had that that protested then that\ncould be settled and we could get on\nwhen making a product that needs to be\ndone thank you senator\nSenator you you have another question\nbut you're welcome to yield the well\nanytime Senator I'll take one more\nI'm trying you you got two hours until\nit's midnight so yeah\nprobably why senator\nthank you Senators please vote for this\nbill we've got to move this forward Mo\ngreen thank you I recognize the senator\nfrom the 46 to speak\nthank you Mr President\nSenators my motion was going to be to\ndisagree so that we could go to\nconference and see what's in this bill\nand see if we could resolve our\ndifferences in it I believe I heard the\nsenator from the 13th just say this is\n53 pages I don't know what all is in it\nand then went on to say the parts that\nhe did know\nwe are known as a deliberative body\nthis is making a mockery of\ndeliberations\nyou will remember back\nbefore crossover day\nparts of this bill were on our floor\nthe hemp Bill and it was such a disaster\nit ended up being reconsidered being\ntabled never got out of this chamber\nI haven't been able this has been on our\ndesk literally maybe two minutes before\nit was called up\nthree minutes I hadn't had a chance to\neven read it I can tell looking at it\nthat it adds a whole nother bill\non hemp regulation\nit also vastly changes the bill that we\njust passed out of here a couple of days\nago we asked the Department of\nAgriculture to review\nthe rules the regulations the licensing\nthe usage of medical marijuana\nto see what was the best past path going\nforward\nwe don't even know if the Department of\nAgriculture wants this responsibility\nyet\nwe are now destroying we are abolishing\na commission that we established that\nworked for four years and finally issued\nthe licenses two of them who are now up\nand running and claim they will have the\nproduct on the shelves by June\nand have tentatively issued the other\nfour licenses that are being litigated\nand we anticipate that litigation will\nfinish up about the time the Department\nof Agriculture tells us the best way\nforward whether he even wants to license\nthis\nengage in it test all these products do\nthe different things that might be asked\nit seems so unfair to us to just\nunilaterally now go abolish a commission\nwithout any hearings on that to ever let\none member of the commission come\ntestify where they are what they've done\nwhat they think\nthis does exactly what the senator from\nthe 39th said it stops IT circumvents\nthe judicial process throws all these\nnine cases out of court and says y'all\nare going to mediation now\nwith the Department of Agriculture\nwhat experience in any other area\ndoes the Department of Agriculture have\nin mediations\nor rendering decisions they never got to\neven consider any of the applications\nthat these 69 companies submitted\nand what about the others 63 of them\nthat didn't litigate\nthat they get to come back to the table\nand and be mediated themselves no\nthey are out we punish those people that\ndidn't sue\nand we reward the ones that sued but we\ndon't trust our own court system\nthat is hearing those cases right now we\nsay that our Department of Agriculture\nis more suited to resolve people's\ndisputes\nthan our court system\nwhat are we doing\nI I don't\nunderstand where these ideas came from\nbut I can tell you this they never came\nthrough our committee process\nnone of this bill other than a few\naspects of what I'm hearing now I hadn't\nhad a chance to read on the hemp came\nthrough our committee we didn't\ncontemplate\ndestroying a commission that we\nourselves created just a few years ago\nand totally replacing them with a\ndepartment that we hadn't heard from to\nsee if they want to do this regulation\nyes Mr\nI didn't ask you okay\nas far as the 20 licenses\nLet me refresh you\nwhen we passed this bill out\na few days ago\nwe made a point I let you know that the\nfolks that testified in our committee\nand the regulated Industries committee\nthe two type one licensees and several\nof the type 2 licensees were there\nand they all agreed that just the two\ntype one alone can produce enough low\nTHC oil to treat 600\n000 patients and it's going to be on the\nshelves this June the other four class\ntwo licensees could probably handle the\nsame amount\nso we have we don't need 20 licenses\nsix can produce enough for 1.2 million\nsome say as many as 2 million patients\nand you know how many we have\ntwenty six thousand\nwe already have enough production for 20\ntimes the patients that are listed\nthat have signed up on the registry so\nwhy are we doing this\nwhy do we think that we as a legislative\nbody are smarter than the court system\nor smarter than the commission that we\nappointed\nour own governor and lieutenant governor\nand speaker appointed these people to\nthe commission to make these decisions\nit is crazy and so all this motion is\nreally doing\nis either trying to pass out a bill that\nmore than likely ought to be vetoed for\nbeing so ill-considered makes us look\nlike a bunch of clowns in here for\npassing something out without any\ndeliberation on it at all\nand\njust sticks it to the court system\nsaying we don't trust our own court\nsystem\nto come up with a reasonable resolution\nto these disputes over the licenses\nI urge you\nto vote no on this motion to agree and\nif we're going to do something of this\nsignificance let's do it right\nI'm happy to take any questions Mr\nPresident or I'll yield the well you do\nhave one question senator from the\nsecond thank you Mr Senator Yale I do\nyou Senator I heard your uh oral\narguments here about trusting our\nJudicial System uh Senator would you\num agree that this body in fact does not\ntrust our judicial system and that's why\nwe have passed so many mandatory\nminimums to tie the hands of those\njudges making those decisions and in\nfact that means we do not trust those\njudges\nTouche on that that we want to make\ncertain that they see the significance\nof the crimes the way we do and that's\nwhy we give the boundaries the minimums\nand the maximums for the penalty and\nleave them to decide they're in between\nSenator you have no further questions\nthank you I yield the will\nsenator from 31st what purpose you rise\nMr Mr President appropriate time I'd\nlike to make a motion\nyou'd like to make a motion like to make\na motion to table HB 196.\nthe motion is in order is there\nobjection\nall those in favor of the motion will\nvote yay all oppose no secretary unlock\nthe machine\non the motion to table the A's are 22\nand the Nays are 30 and the motion has\nfailed\nso we will continue to debate I\nrecognize senator from the 37th\nfamous president ladies and gentlemen\nSenate the hours late but I do want to\nremind us of something and caution this\nbody on the proposition before us\nas the center from the 46 so clearly\nsaid we've got to Bill of 54 pages over\n1300 lines that's not been the through\nthe committee process and this\ndeliberative chamber but what we have\nheard what we haven't heard in the\ndebate tonight is the discussion of\nconcentrating in the agricultural\ncommission or the power to take from six\nor so licenses and expand up to 20\nlicenses\nnow when you think about this\nyou think about our state of Georgia you\nknow we recognize agriculture is the\nnumber one industry in our state you\nknow we lead in in peanuts and\nblueberries or big and cotton we can go\nthrough all the the poultry industry\nhere the the importance of our\nagriculture commissioner is really\num\nhard to really capture\num in the state of Georgia\nwhat I'm concerned about here is what\nthe gentleman from the the senator from\nthe 19th alluded to in his question is\nwhat we're doing\nby concentrating power in the\nagriculture Commissioners this proposal\nwould suggest that we do is we would\ntake an agricultural commissioner role\nwhich is an important Statewide position\nand we would create incentives\nfor the marijuana industry to put their\nperson in that job\nnow the former senator from the seventh\nis our current agriculture commissioner\nserving this body\num served very credibly as it has an\nexpertise as we well know in the in what\nwe recognize as traditional agriculture\nmany of you here that that's your your\nmain livelihood\nbut if we invest this power in the\nagriculture commissioner we're not no\nlonger going to have an agriculture\ncommissioner\nthe money that's going to rush into the\nStatewide race of agriculture\ncommissioner to win the prize\nto win this prize of taking this seat\nwill take the seat which is now the\nagriculture commissioner and turn it\ninto what will effectively be the\nmarijuana commissioner\nI don't think we want the millions of\ndollars that would rush into Statewide\nelections around this commissioner to be\ndriven by marijuana interests\ninstead of Agriculture interests\nagriculture is the industry that our\nstate was founded on it's what bring us\nto the dance\nand I think it's way way way too\nimportant to our state\nto create incentives that the marijuana\ncandidates could wash aside all the\nfolks who really know AG think about our\nprevious\ntwo agriculture Commissioners and how\nthey contributed and are contributing\nsuch a powerful way I think this\nproposal which is put before us tonight\nat this very late hour is not only Hasty\nbut dangerous\nand I'd ask members to vote no on this\nuh this this version of\nHouse Bill 196. be glad to take a\nquestion Mr Mr President\nyou do have a question Senator\num senator from the second\ndoes the senator Yale yes sir Senator uh\nsince we've been in session we've had\nLitany of bills that have been offered\nto Amendments of other bills and asked\nthe chair for a ruling on their\ngermanness of that bill so is it not\ntrue that it is in fact a practice of\nthis body to move massive amounts of\nlegislation at such a late hours is that\nnot true well I would tell you is it\ndelivered a body I think we should all\nbe cautioned to the extent that happens\nand I think when we've got something\nlike this that the the dollars that are\nin Play are as big as they are\num that something is important as our\nagriculture industry and the leader of\nour industry is in is uh is gonna be\nsubject to millions of dollars of\nout-of-state marijuana investment to win\nthe prize\nof what would effectively become a\nmarijuana commissioner I think this body\nwould be wise to reject this proposal\nand with that Mr President I yield the\nwill\nSenators you will recognize senator from\nthe 19th\nhello\nmembers uh thank you for letting me\nspeak on this on Hospital 9196.\nI try to only come to the well when I\nthink it's important an issue like the\nbudget or an issue I think is going to\naffect something constitutionally\nthis is one of those issues\nwhat this bill allows is 20 additional\nlicenses\nand I heard my friend from the 13th say\nno it's only if he gives them\nreally\nwhat do you think the pressure is going\nto be\non that individual which if you look\nit's only been on your desk for 30\nminutes but if you take a look and read\nit really carefully and you decide you\nwant to flip yourself to about page 16.\nI didn't get to write down the page\nnumbers because it hadn't been there\nlong enough\nyou'll see that it's based with one\nperson not a board\none person\nit's a bill we've debated for years and\nI've heard the argument now that this\ngets it out to people\nwell we've already got two licenses\ngetting it out to people\nthat process is working and I'll tell\nyou I'm the first to tell you that I've\nhad issues with a cannabis Commission\nour body has struck their budget\nwe have worked to try to make that\nbetter and we now have two licenses\nworking\nso why should you take this bill as\nseriously as you take other measures\nwhen we speak here\nlet's use two scenarios one do you not\nlike the agricultural commissioner\ndo you not like it if you don't like the\nagricultural commissioner you should\nvote no to this bill because this gives\nhim extreme power\nhe can pick the licensees\nhe decides if they're going to get a\nlicense\nif you don't like him\nyou shouldn't vote for this bill\nthe second group of people who should\nvote against this bill\nare the people who like\nthe agriculture commissioner and here's\nwhy\nyou're about to give him incredible\npressure\nyou felt the pressure that this\nbuilding's had on things like gambling\nand casinos and horse racing\nand you felt those pressures on you\nand you've had to make your decision\nif you do not think the money in this\nindustry is 10 times that weight\nyou've never been in this building\nand we got to disperse that weight and\nthat pressure over 56 of us\nyou're about to put that weight in that\npressure on one person\nthat's not fair to them\nso what I ask if you're in the category\nthat doesn't like the commissioner you\nvote no\nand if you're in the category that likes\nthe commissioner\nyou should vote no too\nthank you Mr President I yield the will\nrecognize senator from the 16th\nthank you Mr President\nI look at a bill like this I wonder how\nwe go back to our constituents and so we\nhad it on our desk a major major build\nwe had less than 30 minutes to even look\nat that's not gone through the committee\nprocess how can we say that to our\npeople that trust us to make wise\ndecisions and to rush into something\nlike this\nwhat the senator from the 19th said we\ntake it from a commission to one person\nthat is not responsible I believe we\nneed to say no to this right now we need\nto hold with it and take the time to do\nit properly and not rush through\nsomething of this magnitude that has\nimplications to our children to our\nfamilies and if you've got two units\nthat can already do six hundred thousand\nthat's a million two in my math I think\nwe need to walk through and walk\ncarefully through this bill and not vote\non it tonight and say no to it and and\nwork through it that's my portion thank\nyou sir\nSenators yield of the well recognize the\nsenator from the 47th\nthank you Mr President\nyou know one of the things that for me I\nwant to let everybody in here know\nI'm adamantly opposed to the use of\nrecreational marijuana\nI think it would be a terrible thing\nbecause it would open up the courts for\nall kind of litigation and stop our\nbusiness in our community\nat the same token\nI've been pushing for for years to try\nto get the medicinal use of marijuana or\nsome byproduct of it for years\nand and I know that we've got a lot of\nnew people that have changed faces in\nhere since the the a little over four\nyears ago\nbut some of y'all that are in the\nRepublican caucus I know for sure and\nprobably some of y'all in the Democrat\nCollege because I'm willing to bet he\nwent to both caucuses he said but\nGovernor deal came to us on the last day\nthat we were in legislature in in\nsession the uh his last year that he was\ngovernor I believe that would have been\nlike 2019 or something\nand he talked about his business partner\nand friend that's wife had terrible\nseizures had seizures for for years and\nyears and years they had means they went\nto all kind of medical facilities they\nchecked everything they could do\neventually since somebody told him they\nsaid hey why don't you go try this in\nColorado and and and took the the oil\nfrom Cannabis and and came back in and\nnever had any migraines from that point\nforward and for me the uh I'm not a\ndoctor I'm I'm I was terrible in biology\nand chemistry\nbut we passed the legislation that day\nto to help put this oil out there for\npeople\nwe created a commission we created a\nbureaucracy unfortunately and it seems\nto be that way\nand I will tell you I said the I'm not a\nlawyer but there's a lot of lawyers\ninvolved in this\nour AG commissioner my fraternity\nbrother my former Suite mate supports\nthis said the uh going to him he can\nwithstand the pressure of whatever it\ntakes for me I'm going to ask each of\ny'all to help give some relief to those\npeople that need relief we know it's\nit's a situation where we can't import\nit from another state but it's something\nthat we need to be able to provide to\nthose people that need it medically here\nin Georgia and I want to try to help\nthem get that relief and get that done\nso I'll ask you to vote in favor of this\nbill whatever it takes for us to get\nproduction the bureaucracies that we've\nbeen dealing with are holding back the\nuh those people that need help so I'll\nask you to vote green on this Bill thank\nyou\nSenators yield and recognize the Senate\nfrom 30th\nthank you Mr President I'll be quick\nbecause how seriously can you take\nsomebody wearing a seersucker suit and a\npink bow tie\nhey like six times medical marijuana has\ncome for this body since I've been here\nsix times I have voted in favor of\nbecause I look at the the challenges\nwe've had with the kids with with adults\nwith debilitating diseases and I have\nsaid let's do everything we can to help\nsupport those\nthis will not be the seventh time\nI will vote no on this bill\nthe at the commission that set up the\nthe Cannabis commission they were\nterrible\nthey were probably one of the most\ndisorganized entities that we've ever\nhad\nbut what we don't want to do is compound\nthe problem by rushing through\na bad piece of legislation right here\nwe and I understand for those of you\nsaying let's get the product out\nremember we are getting the product out\nthere is product coming out on this\nwe are going to be able to get to those\nkids and that's honestly that has been\nmy main focus area\nthe medicines they need to help treat\ntheir symptoms\nwithout making a further mess\non these other licenses\nif it's that important\nand we can treat those easily with the\namount that we're putting out\nright now\nlet's be patient and look at the best\nway to move this thing going forward I\ndo think the Cannabis commission needs\nto be absolved\nbut we ought to be real careful in how\nwe're doing this so that's why I'm going\nto vote no on this bill\nas soon as yielded the well senator from\nthe 28th\nthank you Mr President\nthere haven't been a bigger advocate in\nthis chamber over the last six years for\nmedical marijuana\nand I stand before you\nand I'll be honest I'm I was torn on\nwhether I wanted to come down here\nbecause we're\nthis is a process we all know this is a\nprocess and it's a tough process\nand the laws that we put forward\nfive years ago to form this Commission\nwe had no idea it would take this long\nhad no idea\nwe were hoping we'd have it out and\nwithin a year and a half two years and\nit didn't happen\nand when the commission finally got\ntheir act together\nand they finally put out their notice of\nintent\nto make the awards for these licenses\nand yes it was a flawed process it was a\nvery flawed process and and part of it\nwas our fault because we had a flawed\nlaw we put forward a flawed law that put\nforward a flawed process\nand here we are again we're not going to\ndo it once but we're going to do it\ntwice\nthere are two flawed bills combined\ntogether that we're being asked to vote\non\nwe heard we heard testimony let's talk\nspecifically on the hemp piece\nthere are there are small businesses out\nthere that we are about to put out of\nbusiness if we pass this\nand when we talk about the medical\nmarijuana side and we talk about why\nmedicine is not on shelves\nwell guess what it would have been a\nyear it would have been in there a year\nago we would have medicine on the\nshelves\nif these court cases were done\nbut they're not they're being dragged\nout they're in appeals and that is why\nwe don't have medicine on the shelves\nthere's no other reason\nand it again it pains me to come down\nhere and talk about this because I have\nfriends that have applied\nand I want them to get it I wanted them\nto get it then but they didn't\nand now they've asked for their day in\ncourt\nthey have asked for a judge to make a\ndecision\nand we're taking that away\nand not only that now we're about to add\nwe're about to give standing to the next\ngroup of folks the next group of people\nthat filed\nthat applied for this we're about to\ngive them standing\nso that they can sue so are we going to\ncome back next year and add 20 more\nbecause if you watch what happened in\nFlorida that's pretty much what happened\nlook we spent a lot of time on a study\ncommittee to put forward a law and a lot\nof that stuff was was entailed it was it\nwas put into what we passed out of this\nchamber and what we passed out of out of\nthis capital\na lot of that was put in a lot of it was\nleft out some of that through the Senate\nprocess and through a committee sub when\nthe Senate did have input\nsome of that was put back in\nrecommendations that we had made six\nyears ago from that study committee\nand now they're all taken out\nthe senate had zero input on this\nagain going back to that study committee\nI insisted six years ago that it be and\nno pun intended but it be a joint study\ncommittee of both Chambers House and\nSenate so that we could both have input\nwe were about to go to conference on\nthis bill\nso that both Chambers could have input\nbut now we've lost that and now we have\nto vote on this\nagain we put a flawed law out there\nfive years ago\nand we've we've seen the the issues that\nit has caused and now we're about to do\nit two more times with one vote\nit's bad policy y'all\nSenators yielded well\nI recognize the majority leader uh Mr\nchairman not Mr President I move the\nquestion\nSenators move called question\nhere's their objection\nwithout objection the

this issue\nthank you Mr President I'll be quick\nsince we've debated this pretty\nthoroughly I think most people have been\nheard\nplease vote with me to disagree to the\nhouse position\nand let's send it back to them\nand see if they will either recede and\naccept this bill so we can make progress\non medical marijuana or if they will\ndisagree so that we can try to have a\nquick conference committee see if\nthere's any common ground and waive the\nrule if need be so that we can get\nsomething done this time I think that's\nthe way to go that's a totally new bill\nthat we weren't familiar with at all it\nhas a lot of new Concepts a lot of\nthings we don't understand perhaps they\ncan explain them in a conference so\nplease join with me to disagree to the\nhouse amendment to

recognize the senator from the 45th\nto speak to the bill\nbefore before you get started though I\nwant to recognize the former mayor of\nAugusta Georgia and former state senator\nour good friend Hardy Davis is up here\ntoday so\nhe was always so good to me when he was\nhere in the state senate I just knew\nhe'd get me on the Augusta Nationals and\nbecame mayor so\ndidn't happen though that's all right I\nstill love him so glad to have you here\nsenator\nrecognize senator from the 45th\nthank you Mr President\nI bring\nhb353 before you today I'm the Senate\nsponsor of this bill I'm also the Senate\nsponsor of amendment number four uh the\noriginal bill it did it had eight things\nthat it did it allowed for a gift card\nfor Redemption it increased the prize of\nClass A gains which is your crate your\ncrane games or your games you see to\nChuck E cheese from five dollars to\nfifty dollars uh it also it also offered\nuh regulated Industries and protections\nunder the administrative procedures act\nand a few other things is what it did\nputting guard rails on the industry\nadding more transparency to the industry\nbut after a long debate and going back\nand forth within this chamber and with a\nhouse\nmy amendment number four it deletes\nlines 34 through lines 294 and\nessentially only leaves the APA portion\nin the bill\nand essentially so what it would do with\nif we adopt uh amendment number four it\nwould only leave the administrative\nprocedures act in the bill the\nadministrative procedures act for the\nco-am division under the Georgia Lottery\nCorporation\nthis will make the process regarding\nrules and regulations more transparent\ngiving stakeholders the right to give\ninput the Georgia Lottery would have to\ncomply with the administrative\nprocedures Act only when acting as a\nregulator for co-am this would not apply\nto traditional lottery games like\nscratch-offs and others AP would be\nallowed for more transparent rule making\nprocess with notice in writing with a\nperiod so the master licensee or the\ntenant or the location owner would have\ntime to respond in writing\nit affords a lottery a recognizable\nstandards with rules when there's\nchallenges between licensees and\nlocation owners as well with that Mr\nPresident be happy to answer any\nquestions or yield the well\nyou have no question Senator but would\nyou like to speak to your Amendment\nyes I did you did okay all right so you\nhave you have no questions so thank you\nMr President will\nrecognize the senator from the 46 to\nspeak to his amendments\nthank you\nthank you\nsenator from the 18th what purpose do\nyou rise\nsorry\nno it's they all strike the same thing\nthank Mr President\nladies and gentlemen I didn't see this\non our desk that it was coming this\nquickly so I'm trying to get my notes\ntogether on the Amendments that we have\na couple things about co-am we've spent\nsome time on this subject matter over\nthe last few years these are coin\noperated Amusement machines they're\nessentially slot machines you see them\nin the grocery stores and well the\nconvenience stores and gas stations\nthey're usually back in the back in the\ndark areas\nand sometimes you'll see people sitting\nthere at them for hours and sometimes\nyou'll see them where they're just empty\nwhere nobody's even playing on\nthey are\npretty close to slot machines they try\nto tell you that they're a game of skill\nbut I can tell you in other states they\ncall this distributed gaming\nand what that is is one owner of the\nslot machines distributes them in many\nlocations around the state rather than\nputting them in one central location\nlike a casino\nthis bill does several things to really\nput that industry on steroids so to\nspeak\nright now if you play a coin operated\nAmusement machine and you win\nyou're only paid in merchandise at the\nstore they're promotional\nand that was their intention they're\ncontrolled through the Georgia Lottery\nso the proceeds the profits go to the\nmaster licensees that own the machines\nthey go to the location licensees that\nput the machines out for the public to\nplay\nand only 10 percent goes to the Lottery\nCommission\nto be distributed amongst Pre-K programs\nand hope scholarships\nthat's vastly different than most of the\nrest of the nation\nfor example in Illinois\nthey divide the proceeds one-third\none-third one-third\nthe state of Illinois gets a third of\nthe profits the master licensees that on\nthe machines get a third of the profits\nand the location licensees that have\ntheir machines there for play get a\nthird of the profits\nand that's much closer to what the state\nof Georgia's statutes require the\nLottery Commission\nto earn on the draw games and the\nscratch-off games those lottery games\nwe have a statute that requires them to\ngenerate 35 return to the state or as\nclose as practicable\nthey have not been very good at doing\nthat over the years\none time they were down to receiving\nonly 23 to 25 percent\nfinally here in the last few years\nthey're getting up closer to 26 or 27\npercent\nthe national average of lotteries is 30\npercent\nwhen you're talking about six billion\ndollars\nin sales that's a lot of money\nwhen we had our problem with the\nLottery funding going down and not able\nto fund hope scholarships as high as we\nonce did\none time we got down to about 80 percent\nnow thank goodness we're with this\nGovernor we're back up to 100 percent\nfunding of Our Hope scholarships\nbut at one time when money was down you\nknow I had done the math on that an\nextra\nfive percent was about 50 million a\npercentage point would have getting us\ngotten us up another 250 million we\nwould have never had to cut\nthe lottery\nwhat you have now is you have a\nsituation\nwhere the lottery is generating over 6\nbillion a year in sales and 1.5 billion\nin profits\nthat goes to Hope and Pre-K\nthe same department is running these\nslot machines the co-am machines that\nthey're getting\n10 percent of the profits\nbut I think you're going to hear\ncentered from the 52nd run through the\nnumbers that it's really more like three\npercent of the sales\nso we are cannibalizing ourself\nwe are offering products that pay\nsignificantly lower return to our\ntaxpayers\nthen scratch off tickets do or Draw\ngames do\nit's crazy for us to incentivize this\nand try to increase play on these\nmachines\nfor this piddly little return\nso Amendment two that I'll speak to\nFirst changes that to be more in line\nwith Georgia law and with the national\nNorms what happens in other states\nso you'll see on line seven it\nline seven it raises the percentage\ngoing to the state to 35 percent to\nbeing\nsync with what our statute requires\nand what other states do so that if\npeople decide to play co-ams more\ninstead of they're spending their money\non scratch-offs or Draw games at least\nthe state will generate the same income\nfrom it\nand it takes the remainder and it splits\nit between the master licensee\nand the location licensee at 32 and a\nhalf percent each\nit's important to know that because\npeople cannot\nspend their winnings on anything other\nthan merchandise\nwe do not let them buy alcohol with it\nand we do not let them buy tobacco\nproducts with it\nbut we do let them buy lottery tickets\nwith their winnings\nand there are vendors that say in many\nstores\nover 50 percent of the lottery tickets\nsold are from winnings on the co-am\ngames\nand that's the other big problem with\nthis bill and I'll speak briefly\nto Amendment four\nthis completely changes the industry\nso instead of now turning in your\nwinnings like a ticket as if you were in\nChuck E cheese for a prize you can now\nget a gift card\nyou can get a debit card essentially\nthat spins just like cash anywhere in\nthe world\nso you no longer have to spend it at the\nstore that's trying to get your business\nand you can spend it on alcohol\nfood\nanything else you want to buy\nso we get rid of those\nlimitations that we've put on it so far\nit makes it more like casino gambling\njust a row of six slot machines in every\ncorner convenience store instead of in a\ncasino\nI believe you're going to end up\nwith more sales and that's why the\nindustry's been pushing this for a\ncouple of years\nand you're going to end up reducing\nyour lottery ticket sales so you're\ngoing to give up something that you're\nmaking 27 for something that you're\nmaking three percent unless we pass\nAmendment two\nAmendment four\nmakes it even simpler\ncontinue with the co-am machines\nwhatever other changes are in the bill\nbut don't allow these gift cards that is\nchanging the nature of this game to\npromoting widespread gambling in the\nstate of Georgia without any citizen\ninput on that\nso what I would ask you to\nvote Yes for Amendment two\nto give the state of Georgia a fair\nreturn on its investment here\nand I would ask you to vote Yes for\nAmendment four\nuh I believe that's the one that deletes\nis that is that the wrong one\nsays Dixon\nof course\nit deletes 34 through 294 which are the\ngift card portions\nand with that I'll take any questions\nthere may be\nyou I'm sorry Senator I couldn't hear\nyou would you I'm happy to take any\nquestions you do have a question Senator\nSenator from the 26.\nsenator from the 16th\nthank you Mr President\nSenator Gill I yield\nlet me ask this be the current situation\nis that our gift cards are in a\nmerchandise giving and we're going to\ngive them and as I understand it now a\ndebit card or a card that can be\nconverted into cash is that correct\nthat's correct what would keep a a store\nor a vendor from taking that card and\ncashing it and keeping money back on\nthat card is there any provision to keep\nthat from becoming kind of a how do you\nsay a discount on on cash cards if you\nwill and converting that money just to\nplay the machines again\nI've heard many anecdotes that that is\nwhat happens with many many folks that\nthey'll trade a discounted amount of\ncash for a card\nso they could cash the card to play the\nmachines more\nwell you can yeah you can get cash money\nfor the card if you can talk somebody\ninto buying your card from you\ngive them a discounted price they\nprobably would do that it becomes an\nunderground type currency really is what\nit becomes that we don't have now\nwhatever needs to be done whether it's\ndrugs alcohol or whatever we then\nconvert those prize winnings back into\nsomething that can be not traced I think\nso okay thank you sir\nSenator you you have no more questions\nthank you I yield the well\nrecognize the senator from the 52nd\nthank you Mr President\nthe previous Senator was being generous\nwhen he said 10 percent\nthe hope is 27 yeah it should be more\nthan that but it's 27 percent of the\ngross amount\nthe co-ams is 10 of the net amount\nwhich is around 30 percent so it's of\nthe gross total of sales is three\npercent is what the state gets versus 27\npercent\non the hope\nif this passes\na co-am that's hurting us because it's\ncannibalizing the lottery will hurt us\neven more because then those cards will\nbe used as cash to go elsewhere whereas\nright now they can be used for lottery\ntickets it will decrease sales\nof\nthe cash cow for hope\nthat we get 27 percent of\nit will hurt children going to school if\nwe pass this in this form\nin 2013 when this was voted in and South\nCarolina voted it down and took all the\nmachines out\neverybody said there's no way they'll\nget cash from these we've got a system\nthat won't allow it now the solution is\nto give them cash\nso that they can\nget in the form of a credit card and be\nused as a card for cash and again\nsince they can swap men right now for\nlottery tickets there will be less of\nthat done and more keeping the cash\nand less children will be able to get\n100 Hope from this bill this is a\nterrible bill\nit will hurt the Hope Lottery if we pass\nthat I yield the will\nsenator from the fourth you would speak\non the measure\nthank you Mr President\num\nI'd like to say a couple quick things on\nthis if this is such a bad if a co-am\nmachine is such a bad deal\nwe've got 145 million dollars last year\nwent to the lottery\n145 million dollars went to Lottery and\nif you talk to the lottery people that\nhave put in these gift cards they'll\ntell you that they are exceeding\nexpectations\nand and the most you can put in a\nmachine at one time is five dollars you\ncan't sit there and do it forever and\never and ever and put put in hundred\ndollars five hundred dollars a thousand\ndollars you put in five dollars a time\nso it limits it the great thing about it\nfor me if I was playing a gift card\nwould be that I could stop by and pick\nup my laundry on the way home\nI could take my wife out to dinner that\nnight I could buy gas\nand yes you are taking money away from\nthe from the stores right there but\nyou're taking it and putting it in other\nstores so to sell you're not losing the\nsales tax they're going to another store\nthis is a good bill we need to pass this\nthis will add more money to the lottery\nand will help educate our children\nplease press green on this Bill thank\nyou\nI recognize senator from the 26. speak\nto the measure\nthank you uh Mr President ladies and\ngentlemen let me tell you something this\nain't been going around 25 years\n25 years let me tell you what used to\nhappen\nthey used to give gift certificates\nwhen they gave the gift certificate you\ndidn't have a problem about folks paying\nout cash you didn't have gays going\naround the stoves putting up yellow tape\nlocking Folks up\ntaking money for illegal payouts\nnow what the gift card does is this\ntakes the cash out the game\nbe like a debit card\nbut\nif you want to go on the black market\nand try to sell it\nfor less than what is worth\nthen go right ahead but it will allow\nyou to go to Walmart\ngo to the grocery store to get some\ngroceries\nit would allow you to do things\nand you would get a tick\nin the sales tax\nbecause when you smell them and when you\nuse them you got to pay the sales tax on\nthe\nproject\nyou got to pay the sales tax\nthey pay one of the highest taxes\nit's 10 percent of the gross\n10 percent of the gross\nis what the lottery gets\nthen not only that\nbetween the owner and the tenant\nthey got to pay taxes on their profit\ntoo\nso uh roughly you looking at about 17\npercent\nit's what you're looking at\nbut what we are talking about\nis getting the DA's\nout the game rather than locking up\nfolks\nfor illegal payouts\nyou got a card now\nthat you'll be able to take the while\nI'm out of Krogers\nor somewhere and spin it\nand of course you got to pay the sales\ntax\nso we will have an uptick\nand sales tax revenue\nand that we not raise the taxes on\nanybody\nthat's what this bill does\nthat's what it does it's 25 years ago\nand the reason I can tell you about it I\ndid a filibust on it\nRoy Barnes\nand we will call back in special session\nto deal with co-am\nand we've had nothing but problems when\nwe gave the gift certificate we didn't\nhave any problems with it and business\nwas five\nand so what I'm saying to you this is a\nchance\ndid not have folks locked up for\nillegal pan out of cash\nand they can get these cards\nthey and and let's let's talk about it\nthey're not playing here for sardines\nthey plan to get something\nthey are playing to get something\nand you use the card\nto do it\nand we get the sales tax off the car\nbecause when they use the the card to\nbuy products they have to pay the sales\ntax with it\nthat's what it does\neverybody come with all these excuses\nabout it the problem is it's been cash\npayout and once we stopped giving the\ngift certificates we had the problems\nabout the cash pay out now you take it\nto the card they find out that the cards\ndo work\nthe cards do work and we do get an\nuptick in sales tax money\nand that's all it does and what I would\nask you to do is vote for the\ngentleman's uh Amendment\nto the bill\nand defeat all other amendments\ndefeat them\nplain I defeat them let's deal with the\ncard and take the cash out the game\nSenator Senator from the 28th would like\nto ask you a question I believe the man\nfor making well he comes back here he\ncomes back\nI'm not scared of you\n[Laughter]\nsenator\nyou better

to\nspeak to her Amendment\nthank you I'll be brief I I want to\npresent Amendment Three hopefully\neveryone has received it and can find it\non their desk\nthis amendment is simply to ensure\ntransparency and consistency by the\nGeorgia Lottery Corporation and it's\ndealing with all the um various coin\noperated Amusement machine business\ninterests under this amendment if a\nlicensee or another business interest\ncomes to GLC and requests an opinion on\nwhether certain practices are considered\nlegal and proper under the law or\nregulations if the Lottery Corporation\nrenders an opinion it must actually\npublish that opinion on its website so\nthat all interested parties within the\nco-am industry will be aware of what is\nand what is not permitted examples of\nwhen that happens is when it interprets\na uh a statute administered by it or any\nrule or regulation adopted they're under\nmakes a recommendation about possible\nenforcement\nor whether an exception should be\ngranted and this just makes it so that\neveryone is aware who's within the\nindustry what what the what the GLC has\nsaid is and is not legal so everyone can\nbe on the same page and abide by the\nsame rule so it's just a transparency\nAmendment happy to answer any questions\nif any of my colleagues have any\nyou have a question from the senator\nfrom 26.\nthank you um\nwhat the sound of the Year certainly to\nmy good friend and the two uh Senator I\nmisspoke I signed that Amendment but uh\neveryone uh\nlikes the\nDixon Amendment and and felt like that\nif the

executive order\nthey are being used throughout the state\nthey've been being rolled out since last\nsession or since last summer\nthey are very popular some of the issues\nthat we're seeing uh if there's a store\non one corner that's that's using the\nthe state issued gift card and then if\nyou've got a store on another corner and\nI've had several of these issues arise\nand heard countless stories\nthe convenience store across the street\nis not using the gift cards still using\nthe uh just basically the receipt that\nyou get in the store and you can use it\nfor buying anything on premise\nthere's an issue with some some of those\nstores giving cash inducements or cash\npayouts this gift card would eliminate\nthat and you'll see that now where\nyou've got the gift card being used\nacross the street where it's not all the\nfolks are gambling are using the co-ed\nmachines across the street where they\ndon't have the gift card if we legalize\nthe gift card it would level the playing\nfield it would do away with a lot of the\ninducements and a lot of the issues\nwithin the industry just wanted to say\nthat to you but also wanted to make you\naware I know some of y'all are hearing\nfrom the senator from the 26 and I\ncouldn't agree with you more and all\nwith your statement he called it the\nDixon Amendment it's actually amendment\nnumber four it does delete there
