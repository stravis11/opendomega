general business relative to child custody.\nChair recognizes Representative Clark to explain the Senate substitute and the House amendment.\nThank you, Madam Speaker.\nHouse Bill 233, as we passed, unanimously had to stop in the sitting kids out of state to these reunification camps.\nAnd the House amendment.\nGentlemen, we'll suspend.\nPlease proceed.\nI've attached the language from House Bill 350.\nIt made it two rules.\nDidn't have enough time to get out on crossover.\nHas a special place in my heart.\nBack in, I think it was 2018.\nIt helps rescue babies.\nNewborn babies, well women are say being sex-traffited\nor going through, they fight their lives on danger\nand they need to get the baby to safety.\nAnd it expanded it to fire station,\npolice stations, hospitals, and all that.\nWell, what this allows is a baby box\nto where they can place the baby in it.\nAnd then the alone will go off.\nAnd the newborn baby is placed in the box\nand then the baby is transported to a medical facility.\nAnd after the baby checks out,\nthe fat comes within six hours\nand takes hold the baby also.\nThe primary alarm has to be checked once a month.\nTwice a day, the box has to be physically checked\nto make sure the baby is not in the box.\nOn top of it, they already have the alarm and all that.\nAnd I'll say, you might have seen it was in front page\nin the news and Tennessee.\nThey allow the same thing, and they'd rescue the baby.\nBut an amazing program, and it would allow the same thing here.\nAnd seven baby just being left, say, on the ground,\nyou know, at a police station, and the mom goes,\nso it just allows the box, the technology's there,\nmultiple states allow it, and we'd love to have your support.\nI'll take any questions on this.\nYou have a question.\nChair recognizes Representative Cannon for a question.\nThank you, Madam Speaker.\nDo you?\nAre you?\nI want to first thank you for this subject.\nIt's something very near and dear to my heart,\nas well as a labor doula.\nBut I do have some questions for you after discussing with some national organizations\nabout the different ways to do this same type of program.\nMy first question is online 66.\nIt says provided that the newborn child is no more than 30 days old.\nHas you considered making that up to 60 days old, which is typical around the country?\nI know, I remember carrying the bill from back when I carried the bill while we had the 30 days.\nA lot of times past 30 days has to do with law and kind of child abandonment or something like that.\nAnd I remember it last.\nWhen I carried in 2018, we had that 30 days because this is that time where usually if a woman is in fear for a life, sex trafficking, she has the baby and she needs to get a baby to safety.\nAnd there's something fun when I remember is why we have that 30 days.\nBut I mean, I'm open if you wanted to keep something down the road and change it to 60 days.\nBut I mean, I think 30 days is enough time to where the mother has a child, and she can\ndrop it off at one of these locations.\nBut thank you for your question.\nThank you, G.\nFurther Hill?\nOh, you have one more.\nOkay.\nAnd so, the way that this is written, there's an opportunity for someone to surrender a\nnew born at multiple locations, not just at a fire station, but there's other locations.\nSome would consider it to be best practice that those surrenders happened at a hospital,\nspecifically at an ER, which is what most of the national, or most of the states do.\nAnd so there's no need for the ambulance service.\nSo my question is, why are we including multiple different agencies creating multiple places\nof possible liability instead of just keeping it with that hospital?\nWhereas here it says medical facility, what's a medical facility versus a hospital?\nI'll say, I mean, I passed, and again, I'm gonna pull up my bill, but it expanded to the locations that's being allowed.\nAnd we've had the data, I mean, I've not seen anything negative come from these different places of letting the baby be dropped off there.\nMore places, and these places have to be a 24-7 facility, and since the bill that I passed years ago.\nhelp rescue babies and all that. So I felt very comfortable with the language in there\nand that it's going to protect babies and keep them safe. Thank you.\nChair recognizes Chairman Cooper for a question.\nThank you, Madam Chair.\nWell, gentlemen, heo.\nYes, ma'am.\nOkay.\nIsn't it true that sometimes usually at hospitals and at the fire station all the person\nwhen they're leaving the child actually comes in contact\nwith either the fireman or the nurse or someone.\nAnd many of these mothers do not want to be identified.\nAnd so what the boxes do is give them a chance\nto put the baby in a safe place instead\nof leaving them in the woods to the elements,\ngives them a chance to live and to be safe.\nBut the mother doesn't have to identify themselves.\nIs that not true?\nIt is definitely true.\nThank you.\nChair recognizes leader of frustration for a question.\nMadam Speaker, brought to you, is gentleman yield for you?\nSir, is it not true that this legislation,\nwhich allows for the protection of babies\nfor them to be put into care in a controlled environment,\nas legislation was worked on by representative Cameron,\nvery hard, was considered here in this house.\nAnd it's just simply part of your bill here at this late stage of session.\nExactly.\nRight in line with my bill and just protecting the babies, protecting the mothers.\nAnd yeah, thank you so much.\nThank you for bringing this bill.\nThank you.\nWith that, I yield the well and ask you a favorable consideration of House Bill 233.\nThank you.\nThe gentleman is yielded the well.\nIs there any objection to the adoption of the House of Mement?\nThe chair here is none of the House of Mement is adopted.\nOn the gentleman's motion, the House agreed to the Senate substitute to House bill 253.\nAll those in favor will vote yes, all those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machines.\nThe\nhead all members voted.\nFor what purpose does representative Cameron rise?\nPardon me in the choir state your inquiry isn't treatment of speaker that\nDuring the process of this bill a baby was surrendered at a box just over the border for me in Tennessee and\nThe it was successful in a fire hall and the baby went through\nThe hospital and into foster care\nSuccessfully the gentleman knows of which he speaks what purpose does representative Clark rise\nIs it not true that I had a question for the speaker and if he doesn't mind do it on\nparliamentary inquiry, I'm really curious.\nI had a town hall and this issue of Ethan's law came up and there were some family law\npeople that were concerned about this outlawing the ability to have families reunite in any\ntype of way. And so I just wanted to get clarification on that. Is that not true Madam Speaker?\nI'm sure the lady knows of which she speaks and I encourage her to speak with the original author about that.\nHave all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the gentleman's motion, the yeas were 146.\nThe nays were 15 and the house has agreed to the Senate substitute to house bill 253.\nMembers, we have a special guest to the come and join us here in the house, Emily asks Mr.\nDoorkeeper, would you uh, Mr. Senator, the governor of the great state of Georgia, the\nHonorable Brian P.

Kemp, can give him and admit us into this Georgia House of Representatives.\nWelcome, Governor Kemp.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nMembers and guests, if you'll, give me your attention please.\nwe're certainly blessed here in our state to have a first family. Now I want to\nrecognize, I know you're going to do it again, at least one of them, but I want to\nrecognize the best third daughter in the state, Amy Porter Camp. Amy Porter, thank\nfor being here and the first lady for our state blessed us earlier with her\npresence in this chamber. First Lady Marty Camp, you're appreciated in so many\ndifferent ways by this house and by the people of this state. Thank you for being so\nprerative and so many issues that imported the Georgians and thank you for supporting\nour governor.\nLet's give a wonderful round of applause to that first lady.\nA gentleman that certainly needs though introduction in these parts, he's led this state through\nthick and thin, and he's done an outstanding job of bringing good, old-fashioned, common\nsense back to the job.\nHe said it's a pretty good predecessor, and I'll say that as well who excise those same\ngreat qualities.\nHe certainly has done the same.\nWe've got a little bit of work for you, Governor.\nWe've been sending you some bills.\nWe hope you'll keep that pin sharp, and at least sign the bills that came out of the\nHouse. It's my great honor, y'all. I know it is y'all's will to have the governor of\nthis state in this house chamber, the people's house, a people's governor, the 83rd governor\nof the great state of Georgia.\nGovernor Brian P. Kemp.\nOh, man.\nThank y'all.\nThank y'all so much.\nHappy signing, everybody.\nThank you so much.\nI was just thinking when the speaker was talking about keeping\nthe pins, sharpening the pins up,\nI was thinking to myself, they're sharp,\nor it's just a matter of which color we're going to use.\nJust kidding, just kidding.\nSpeaker Burns, thank you so much for having me.\nSpeaker, pro-timp Jones, majority leader,\neffustration,\nand our leader,\nleader, Hugley, members of the people's house.\nI, like you all, are honored to have our great First Lady,\nMarty Kent with us, and Amy Porter.\nThank y'all for welcoming them so much this evening.\nWe are very thankful that you have yet again delivered\na historic session for the people of our state.\nSince you gavled the session in just 81 days ago,\nyou have secured another one-time tax refund\nfor Georgia families fighting through the high prices\nthey've experienced over the last four years.\nYou passed a second tax cut acceleration,\nwhich will further help hard work in Georgia and job creators\nand save them at least another $725 million a year.\nI know we are all proud of the work\nand the much needed relief for those that have been devastated by Hurricane Helene.\nYou also supported legislation to strengthen our workforce\nand not only to keep us the number one state for business\nbut also make us the top state for talent.\nAnd together, we have achieved something\nno other General Assembly has done in over a generation,\nand that has passed meaningful toward reform.\nNow, I know you all know that fight was hard\nand the debates were fierce,\nbut it's my belief at the end of the day\nwe have a common sense, comprehensive piece of legislation\nthat will keep our state moving in the right direction.\nAnd while tort reform may have been controversial, and some people may have been for it, and others\nmay have been against it.\nOne thing we can all agree on is nobody wanted a special session.\nI also want to thank you for your work on getting the FY 2026 budget pass.\nChairman Hatchett, thank you for your leadership, and I know it's a lot of hard work this year,\nespecially.\nIncluded in that budget there's strategic investments that make our state stronger and further develop our infrastructure\nThrough those investments the state is doing what we can to keep people working in all parts of our state no matter your zip code\nAnd they're doing this while returning taxpayer dollars to where they belong to our people\nI appreciate the strong support in the back of the chamber.\nOther states are raised in taxes on their citizens just to make ends meet.\nThink about California, New York, and Maryland, just to name a few.\nnot here in Georgia.\nHere in the best state for business and opportunity,\nwe budget conservatively.\nAnd that's why we're able to make historic investments\nwithout increasing debt,\nand are able to give Georgians a third tax rebate,\nand cut taxes while we're at it.\nThankfully, much like years passed throughout my second term,\nthe partnership and thoughtful coordination\nbetween the House, the Senate, and my office\nbenefited the people of our state and put George on a path to continue prosperity and\nopportunity. My hope is that we continue that successful streak which will benefit hard\nwork in Georgia's most of all.

non-violent\nprotest.\nHis leadership in events like the Montgomery bus boycott,\nthe March on Washington,\nhelped lead to significant legislative victories,\nsuch as the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\nand the Voting Rights Act of 1965,\nwhich dismantled institutional segregation\nand secure voting rights for all,\nincluding African-Americans.\nToday, his work continues to serve as a foundation\nfor defending the rights he fought so hard to secure\nin the face of current challenges,\nincluding attacks on voting rights and civil liberties.\nAnd so we want to offer up this moment of silence.\nSome of us, myself, and representative,\nI'm gonna say Teddy.\nTeddy Reese, we are members of the same fraternity\nthat Dr. King was, and that's Alpha Phi Alpha\nfraternity incorporated.\nSo

as a baby.\nSo this helped her shape her studious personality.\nShe graduated from Julian Catholic High School in Dayton, Ohio, and was recognized for her\nscholastic abilities, becoming the second female to graduate with a Bachelor of Science\nDegree from their prestigious chemistry department.\nWhereas, well at the University of Dayton, she was selected by her mentors to be one of\nthe two students in the cutting edge development research\ndepartment with rare earth metals, a groundbreaking process\nof which you can imagine back then how important that was.\nShe met her husband, John, also at Dayton University,\nand he earned his Bachelor of Science in Physics\nbefore attending the Ohio State University.\nNancy was one, she was one of the first stay-at-home moms\nin 1960.\nAnd she helped form chemical abstract services,\nwhich was an applied chemistry degree,\nnomenclature and chemistry.\nWhereas she was raising her daughter's Maryland and Sharon,\nShe contributed to those chemical compounds,\nand later her third daughter is our own Karen Pope,\none of our great lobbyists here at the house.\nSo whereas she later served as a chemistry and math teacher\nat Lake Braddock Secondary School in Berk, Virginia,\nand she was hardly regarded in participating\nin sports activity before retiring with her education.\nSo, where is, now we resolve at the House of Representatives

sounds really good to me.\nWe're going to start with a teacher representing McQueen.\nThis recognized speech of the bill.\nGive the lady your attention, please.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nI rise today in strong support, or this evening,\nin strong support of the House Substitute to Senate Bill 148,\na thoughtful and forward-looking piece of legislation\nthat takes meaningful steps to support student health\nin rich classroom experiences\nand give educators a little more of the flexibility\nand respect they deserve.\nThis substitute does three important things,\nand every one of them moves us closer to a healthier,\nmore supportive and more effective school environment.\nFirst, this bill creates a pilot program\nfor outdoor learning.\nThis is more than a nice idea.\nIt's backed by research.\nOutdoor learning has been shown to improve student focus,\nmental health, physical activity,\nand engagement, especially for younger learners and students who don't thrive in traditional\nsettings. In the wake of the pandemic, we learn just how valuable fresh air and flexible\nenvironments can be. This pilot gives Georgia a chance to explore outdoor learning as\na practical, scalable tool, not just a trend. We're not mandating, we're learning, we're\npiloting a program, evaluating outcomes and giving districts the ability to innovate\nin ways that support both academic achievement and student well-being.\nSecond, this bill makes a smart change to our AED requirements.\nCurrently, Georgia Law requires a licensed physician to be part of an automated external\ndefibrillator AED program.\nThis substitute removes that requirement, aligning us with best practices in other states.\nWhy? Because AEDs are designed to be used by lay persons in emergencies. They're accessible,\nautomated, and intuitive. By removing unnecessary retake, we make it easier for schools,\nathletic programs, and community spaces to expand life-saving access without waiting on paperwork\nor costly oversight. Third, and I want to speak directly to my fellow educators and school leaders\nhere. This bill increases from 3 to 5, the number of accumulated sick leave days that teachers\nand school staff can take each year for personal or professional reasons, what teachers normally\ncall personal days. This is small on paper, but it's big and practice. Huge. Our teachers\nare juggling more than ever, overcrowded classrooms, emotional strains, second jobs, and family\nresponsibilities, giving them two additional days to take care of themselves, their families,\nor their professional growth is not just about time, it's about trust. It says, we see you,\nwe value you, we know you need space to be your best. It says we want to retain great teachers,\nnot just recruit them.\nSo what do we have here in SB 148?\nA pilot that supports students mental and physical health,\na common sense health policy that could save lives,\na practical change that tells teachers their time matters to.\nThese are smart, modest, bipartisan changes\nthat collectively make a meaningful difference.\nI commend the House Education Committee\nfor their work on this substitute,\nand I urge my colleagues to vote yes\nfor student well-being, for educator dignity, and for a future of thoughtful innovation in Georgia schools.\nThank you, and I yield the well.\nLadies, yield the well.\nRep. Ramon, three to five, please.\nLadies, recognize.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nColleagues, I rise in support of Senate Bill 148.\nThere are incredible sections in this bill, but I wanted to focus\nparticularly on section three, which deals with defibrillators,\nwhich I will not have a prop today.\nSo I want to talk about why defibrillators in schools\nare so important, because this is a life-saving measure.\nAnd I want to just go through some statistics with you all\nabout what this can actually do.\nSo it's hard to think about a child having a cardiac emergency.\nBut the reality of the situation\nis that sudden cardiac arrests\nactually strike 7,000 children and teenagers every single year.\nAnd while sudden cardiac death among student athletes\nhas prompted a drive to equip athletic facilities with AEDs,\nresearch has found that sudden cardiac arrest\noccurs more often with school-aged non-athletes.\nSo you would think, oh, it's just athletes,\nbut in reality, and just put on the field\nor with sports or whatever,\nBut the reality is that it's actually the non-athletic kids.\nThe other reason this is so important\nis because about 70% of students\nsurvive sudden cardiac arrests, which\nis more than seven times the overall survival rate\nfor school-aged children.\nAnd that's specifically because a child's survival rate\nis estimated to decrease by 10% every passing minute\nuntil a shock from a defibrillator is applied.\nThe reality in situation is that time is crucial\nduring these emergencies.\nAnd when it comes to a child, sometimes waiting for an ambulance,\nwaiting for the emergency medical personnel to get there,\ntakes way too long.\nNot only that, but we're also talking about the teachers\nthat work in those buildings, right?\nSo in addition to saving students' lives,\nwe're also talking about staff that work there,\nadmin, teachers, you name it.\nThe reality is that out of hospital,\nsudden cardiac arrests is a leading cause\nof death in the United States to the point\nthat it claims the lives of approximately 356,000 people\nper year.\nThat's awful.\nAnd so today, I mean, I know this is a great bill.\nIt's a Christmas tree bill.\nIt's got some requirements in here.\nBut the reality of this situation\nis this actually one of my favorite types of legislation,\nbecause it literally will and can save lives.\nAnd I'm incredibly grateful to the authors\nfor bringing this forward and making sure\nthat we are doing all that we can\nto keep our kids safe and healthy.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield the one.\nThe lady has yielded the well leader illustration.\nLeader illustration is recognized as big to the bill.\nI just want to commend the legislators that worked on the language that ultimately is reflected here in SB 148 bills that are providing this comprehensive piece of legislation underscoring our commitment to enhance educational experiences and ensure the well-being of our students.\nAnd I want to thank Representative Cox and many members in the chamber who made contributions to this terrific bill.\nMs. Speaker, I'd ask the body's favorable consideration.\nI yield the will.\nThe gentleman's yield is well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?\nHere he none the previous question is ordered, is there any objection with drawing to withdrawing\nthe committee's substitute?\nHere he none the committee's substitute is withdrawn, is there any objection to adopting\nin the substitute offered by the committee on rules.\nHearing none, the Rules Committee's substitute is adopted.\nIs there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee,\nwhich was favorable to the passage of the bill?\nHearing none, the report of the committee is agreed to, shall.\nThis bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill.\nWe'll vote yes.\nAll those opposed will vote no.\nAnd Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine?\nAll members voted.\nAll members voted, all members voted.\nAll members voted this so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine?\nOn the past, just sent a bill 148, the yeas, 165, the nasa zero.\nThe bill hasn't received a requisite constitutional majority.\nIs there for past?\nChairman Powell is recognized for a motion.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker, I ask the House agree to the Senate's substitute as amended by the House.\nMr. Clerk, will you read the caption?\nHouse Bill 651 to be entitled, an act to amend Article 2, Chapter 14 and Title 40 that\nto go to Georgia and tentative related speech detection devices, social revised provisions relative to the use of automated traffic enforcement, safety devices, and schools others.\nChairman Powell is recognized to explain this substitute and the House amendment, Chairman Powell.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker, and ladies and gentlemen, you got before you a couple of documents.\nI want you to look at the first document I'd like you to look at is the Senate\nstuff to house to house bill 651. You know back several weeks ago we were\ntrying to share this problem on these school zone cameras that seemed to have\nbeen getting so far out of hand over the last several years. It became quite\nFranklin will be very blunt they became a got you to they had ceased being a\npublic safety to and it was a revenue generator and most people's opinions\nfor those local jurisdictions we sent a good bill over to the Senate and I\nguess I need to tell you a little bit about the process we sent two bills\nover. 651, they did a thorough cleanup of this whole actions. Representative Washburn\nsent over one that basically banned them. There have been a lot of things that transpired\nthe public safety committee in the Senate wouldn't hear the bills. It cost, there was\nsome blood on the floor over there from that. And then these things got amended. Representative\nThe Washburnsville, they basically did a long time extension to do all of them three years,\nwhich doesn't cure the problem.\nThey took House Bill 651, and I'm just going to go through the changes that they made,\nand then I will go through the changes we put back in.\nIn section one, they took out the speed indicators.\nYou may remember that I talked about the flashing signs with those speed indicators like\nradar so that people would know how fast it would drive and that would slow them down.\nThey took that out.\nIn section 2, well the good thing they left in section 2 was a 10 mile variance that we\nnow have that that's treated the same way as radar with a 10 mile variance.\nIn section 3, section 3 they added language that dealt with the violations\nand complaints to the Department of Public Safety and GDOT, especially on intentional violations.\nIn Section 4, this was a hearing process for those governments.\nSection 5 was the appeal process.\nSection 6 was the opt-out by the officials if they were violating, but also they changed\nthe time.\nIf you remember, when this bill left the house, it was two hours in the morning, an hour\nbefore an hour after school took in, an hour before an hour after it let out an afternoon.\nAnd what the Senate did was that they did it from one o'clock, from an hour before until\nan hour after, and the local governments could run these all through the day.\nIf they wanted to opt out of any time, they had to opt out.\nNow, we'll get back to that, the changes that we made in the amendment in just a second.\nOne of the things they did was they dropped the fine, where we had dropped it from the\nextra 25, we dropped it to 125, they had dropped the fine, total fine to $75, with a 5%\ncharge and that would dump suspecting their idea, that was to mail out the notice on these.\nSo that's a $75 fine and a $3.75 cents, 5% surcharge for sending out the notices.\nWhere we had taken out the Department of Revenue Lean, they put the lean back in.\nThose were a lot of the changes that they made and took it out.\nNow what I'm proposing, and I want to thank a few folks, I want to thank the Speaker's\nOffice for mediating this, quite frankly, the Lieutenant Governor was adamant that they\nwanted to be able to run school cameras from before school until afternoon at the behest\nthat the local officials what they thought was needed.\nIf you'll look on the first amendment\nthat starts on line 14,\nwhat we have done is that we have said\nthat they will put those speed indicators back on these signs.\nSo what you'll see, we've gone back to their original language\nwith the flashing signs,\nbut they'll have those radar indicators\nthat says how fast you're running.\nSo that's in there,\nthey agreed to that tentatively. Then we get into the hours. That starts on\nlines 22 to 41. It defines only on the school day. That's not weekends and\nthat's not any other time. And it's kind of the way this is construed. It's kind\nof difficult to read. But what we have done is we have said that the cities will\nhave to opt in. If they don't pass an ordinance by a resolution of the city\nCouncil to opt into the extended day, then it would be from the two hours in the morning\nand the two hours in the afternoon. If they want to carry through those other hours, they've\ngot to stand up and look at their citizens in passing ordinance to say we want to do this\nthroughout the day. If you look on lines 42 through 47, this deals with the four lanes\nthat they had taken out. And that's quite simple that if they're going to run, if it's\ngoing to be allowed to run these devices on a four lane, it has to be where there's a crosswalk.\nNo more of this stuff like up at Tallula Falls where you got a four lane running out in the\nmiddle of nowhere and they just, you know, there's no crosswalk. So on a four lane, there's got to be\na crosswalk before these things would be eligible. You get on line 48 to 53. This is the notice of\nof a citation. They did leave that in. And the citation just says,\nfailure to pay this, fail this, this final contested liability in\ncourt shall result in the inability to renew your motor vehicle\nregistration. You go down to the next line. And since they had\nput it back into the department of revenue for lean. And what we\nhave said in here that they'll send out a second notice to\nnotify the public in bold letters,\nfailure to pay this final contest liability in court\nwithin 30 days,\nshow results in the inability\nto renew your motor vehicle registration.\nLine 67 through 76 is the language we changed\nand their version,\nthey had all the money going to the local police.\nThey could do that for whatever their purposes.\nWe have put the language back in that any of that money needs to go to school safety\nwithin that district and to be used for school safety purposes.\nThose are the changes.\nThis is the amendment.\nI would tell you that it is not the best thing that we were hoping for, but I will tell\nyou that when we leave here an hour or two, if we don't pass something that it remains\nthe same.\nIt's still just a wide open. Go at it. This is a I think with those flashing speed\nindicators I think with the 10 with the 10 mile an hour variance. I think that\nwith all the proper due diligence of notice I think that this is going to be a\nworkable solution and then when we come back if things are still not that way\nthen we'll be able to deal with it again but I continue to tell you that this\nThis is a path to putting this back as a tool for school safety.\nMr. Speaker, I'll be glad to answer any questions, if that wasn't clear enough.\nThat was pretty clear.\nAs mud as they say, no, that was good.\nYou did a nice job of informing the members.\nAnd if they'll get a little bit quiet, there's a couple of questions that the questions they want to ask.\nI'll recognize some members for some questions,\nbut I want you to be able to hear them.\nGentlemen, you need to vote for a question.\nYes, sir.\nRipley Bayes more is recognized for a question\nto your left.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nYes, ma'am.\nDoes the chairman yield?\nYes, ma'am. Thank you.\nOn page 2, line 25.\nAre you on the amendment?\nIs this AM 390495?\nYes, that's the amendment.\nYes, right.\nLine 25.\nShould it actually say of 10 miles per hour over the posted,\nsays, posted the speed limit?\nWhat we have done is that we have synchronized all\nthis language for the ten mile an hour variance. So if it's opposed to 20\nmiles and that means 30 miles. Where it says over posted law should it say over\nthe posted? Ma'am, I didn't write it. That's legislative counsel and they\ncertainly write different than we do. Okay. It's put an error that needs to be\nI don't think it's an air legislative council wrote this language.\nI know it was poignant.\nThank you.\nGentlemen, do you owe for another question?\nI certainly will.\nTo your left, Representative Niel?\nDo you recognize for a question?\nDoes it, gentlemen, do you?\nGentlemen, do you?\nYes, ma'am.\n9-48, 353, 48.\nI know it.\n9-48, 353, so one major issue that my citizens had, one, was the issue of the tags,\nmotor vehicles being the inability to renew your motor vehicle registration.\nThe second issue we were having is the fact that we have so many erroneous tickets being issued that there is actually no recourse, you can't hear me, okay?\nThe issue what I'm having is what 49 to 53 been put back in is the fact that it feels like we're going back to creating and sitting in the same problem we were trying to alleviate because by the time you get the ticket, whether it's erroneous or not,\ntime and hit your vehicle registration.\nWhen you try to call those numbers,\nyou have no recourse in the courts.\nYou're still forced to just pay your ticket\nand a lot of people in my communities,\nthey just have to pay all the tickets,\nwhether they get a recourse or not,\njust because they need their car.\nSo that's what we're trying to fix.\nI think they asked you a question.\nThe gentleman asked that.\nYes, go ahead.\nAs I understand, this was the language.\nIt was in the first bill that has been changed in lines,\nBut it says a failure to pay, this is that first one you're talking about on those lines,\nthat's the notice that you get when there's been a violation.\nThis says failure to pay this fine or contest the liability in court shall result in the\ninability to renew your motor vehicle rent.\nThat is the notice that you have received the citation.\nThen below that is the next notice that if you have not paid the citation and then before\nwhere it started over to the revenue department,\nthat's the next site, that's the next notice,\nbut you'll notice it will don't play.\nRight, well, if it's erroneous,\nyou don't have a right a way to cure it\nbecause you don't get the option\nof having the court process\nbecause of the way it's just simply structured.\nAnd I feel like, is it not,\nhave we bremedied that?\nI feel like we have not bremedied that problem.\nAnd this is what was hammered out with these folks when you look at the other language\nin there, that this is the notices on that.\nI mean, when you had it, and I remember when we brought this bill before, but I brought\nthis bill before, that people who contested once they called the court if there was something\nthat was not right like the hours or the speed, then they contested it most of the times\nthey were dismissed. Okay, thank you.\nOkay, members.\nWe still have some work to do. The other chamber\ndoesn't have any work to do.\nWe're working for the people of Georgia. You can go home if you want to.\nBut I'm going to stay here and ask the members of this chamber to take care of the people's\nbusiness.\nWe were all elected by the people of this state.\nto come to this place and take care of issues that sometimes we disagree on and those that\nwe agree on, but always with what's in those folks' hearts as what's best for Georgians.\nAnd I trust that for each and every member in this body.\nNow, if you're on this floor and you're not a member, you need to tone it down because\nthis house has some work to do.\nAnd hopefully we can agree on the work we have left if we don't, that's what this house\ndoes.\nBut we're going to move forward.\nSo members, give the gentleman into well your attention.\nIf the folks asking questions to understand the proposition before respect they deserve.\nThe other side can adjourn and go about their business, but this house is going to tend\nto the people's business because this is what?\nThe people's house.\nThe city of Bennett is recognized for a question.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman, with a gentleman of yield.\nYes, ma'am.\nI just need clarification.\nThank you for your thorough explanation.\nIt was kind of challenging to read and listen at the same time.\nIsn't that true that this bill started out being about cameras and school zones?\nIs that now removed?\nAnd school safety, yes, ma'am.\nSo the cameras have been removed online 24 where it says using photographically and photographically has been stricken, recorded images.\nWhat other kind of recorded images will there be?\nThey have not been removed.\nThey have not been removed.\nThey have not been removed.\nOkay, thank you, sir.\nYes, ma'am.\nRepresentative Petrie, Chairman Petrie to your left has recognized for a question.\nThank you Mr. Speaker just Mr. Chairman do you yield yes sir Chairman\nI just want to make sure I'm clear obviously this measure is not what we\nwanted and have worked for for several years I appreciate the great work you've\ndone but am I correct in on line 78 so all these funds are only now to be used\nfor school safety purposes within schools is that correct sir that is correct\nthank you Mr. Chairman for all your efforts thank you\nChairman Dickey is recognized for a question.\nDoes Jim and you like Chairman Petry I appreciate your work and I know it's I'm all for compromised\nwith our friends across the way but isn't it true that this bill really doesn't solve\nour problem with these coozone cameras and I think they're in all of my counties, all\nfive of my counties and this is one of the number one issues I hear and this bill\njust does not change things in my opinion but I appreciate your work on it\nI appreciate that Mr. Washington's work on this but I intend to vote against\nthis amendment I just think it does not do the job it needs to be doing and\nthank you though for the way it worked well I thank you and as I said there's a\na lot of things in here that will tell these bad to being a tool instead of the\ngatchy tool that's been used and it's all we've got. Now I might this may be a\nfitting time to say this and I want to tell the people in this house how proud I am\nI want to tell the members of this house how proud I am that you're still sitting in here and I understand that the Senate has already signed a dad.\nI want to thank Legg Council, I want to thank Haley and the governor in the Speaker's Office.\nI want to thank the Speaker, Chris Riley, and all those folks who intermediated a compromise\nwith the Senate.\nA lot of y'all have heard by opinion over the years about the Senate and how I think so much\nthat you told us ahead it right when they had a unicameral body of the legislature.\nBut we're here doing the people's business as the speaker had said.\nThis was a solution.\nIt wasn't a perfect solution by any means.\nBut it moved us forward to take the get you out of public safety only in regard to these\nschools.\nNow, if this house votes in favor of this, which I certainly hope you will, it'll probably\nhave no meaning since the Senate's already took off. But I want you to know how proud\nI am of everyone in here for standing by to pass something even when there's a hollasuit\nacross the hall.\nGeneral Yeofer, one or two more, I certainly will. A gentleman has spent a lot of time\nworking on this proposition, recognizing representative Washburn for question.\nGive the gentleman your attention, please.\nThank you, Mr. Baker, there's a chairman here.\nI certainly will.\nMr. Chairman, is it not true that you have devoted many hours of time and energy along with\nThe speaker staff to try to come up with a bill that would rain in and correct many of\nthe abuses that have occurred with the school's own cameras across the state.\nIs that not true?\nThe gentleman is correct and I thank you for that.\nAnother question, will you yield for another question?\nCertainly will.\nIs it not true that this has been a joint effort along with me with another bill to try to\ndo something to correct these abuses in the state?\ncertainly has and as I had said earlier, I appreciate you because of the position you've\nbeen in in the Macon-Bibb County area where this has probably been one of the most prevalent\nabuses in the world.\nSo I thank you for your motivation to get involved into this.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nThank you.\nGentlemen, you are for another question.\nBe glad to.\nRepresentative Evans to your left.\nRepresentative Stacey Evans, recognize for a question.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nDoes the gentleman yield over here?\nYes, ma'am.\nSince the Senate has decided to go home\nand you just mentioned, since we're amending what they did,\nI guess it says.\nAnd I know you've worked on this so hard\nas have so many others, and this is a problem.\nI mean, is there any interest in at least taking\nwhat they did so that we could have final passage\nof something?\nNo ma'am.\nI thought I'd ask.\nI do not think that the substitute that they passed\nhas my good friend from Ford Valley had said that this isn't getting it far enough,\nbut this gets it far enough to correct a lot of the misuses.\nBut this did nothing.\nThis did nothing except make it that much worse.\nUnderstood, I'm just afraid we're going to end up doing nothing too, and I hate it.\nBut thank you for your work.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nI think that everybody knows the posture.\nI can tell you that I'd almost say this\nas the first time in 30 some of my years\nthat I tried to pass a bill\nwhen it wasn't anybody to receive it.\nSo I felt like that's another historic move,\nbut I do wanna thank every member of this house\nfor staying in your seats to vote on this\nso that when the press asks questions, it wasn't us.\nWe found a solution, ladies and gentlemen.\nMr. Speaker, I would appreciate the members\nvote on this last issue and I'll step aside.\nGentlemen, as yielded the well, members before I go through the remainder of this bill,\nhere's going to be our posture.\nWe have privileged, privileged resolutions that import it to the members of this house.\nWe're going to take them up for a few minutes.\nWe're going to figure out exactly what we can do, but I think there's some bills that have come across,\nI guess they'll continue working to stay up and get them over here to us and we'll be able to take final action on.\nSo we're going to ask you to stay patient, stay with us as we move through this bill,\nAnd then we'll finish our night up and we'll adjourn to this thing and go sign a die and\ncome back for next year.\nSo with that, is there any objection to the adoption of the House Amendment?\nHere in the House Amendment is adopted.\nOn the gentleman's motion that the House agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill\n6.51 as amended by the House.\nAll those in favor will vote yes.\nThose opposed will vote no.\nAnd Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines?\nShould\nFor what purpose is representing Neil Ross?\nThe rule 133.\nThe lady has that right and the record will so reflect.\nall members voted. All members voted this so, Mr. Clerk, were you locked the machine?\nAll in the gentleman's motion, the yeas are 140, the nays are 29 and the house has agreed\nto the Senate's substitute to House Bill 651 as amended by the House.\nSo members, if I can have your attention, let's see if I can convey this information.\nWe have it on the authority of legislative council.\nAnd anything we pass, the remainder of this evening will be in the Senate for action\non day one of the session in 2026.\nMy opinion is, we continue to pass legislation that's imported to Georgia's impactful for\nto Georgia's and let's do our work and I think that's what we should do. I hope you'll\nagree with me. We're going to conclude with some thank yous a little bit but I'll go ahead\nlet you know this. You know, it appears that the Senate has checked all their\npriorities, all of their political priorities and decided to end their\nnight early to set a finish in their work on behalf of the people that we\nrepresent. Of course, they're free to do as they please, but this chamber puts policy\nover politics, and they're still plenty of good, common sense policy left on this house\nas a agenda.\nAnd we're going to take it up, and we're going to continue to work for the people of Georgia\njust a little bit longer.\nI'm going to ask you to stand at ease for about 15 minutes.\nLet us make sure we get a few pieces of information back\nfrom the clerk of the Senate, the Secretary of the Senate.\nAnd then we'll move on with the business of this house\nfor the good of the people of Georgia.\nThank you members.\nThis house will stand at ease until 10 minutes, until 10.\nand\nyou\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nI'm going to give you a quick look at the\nthe\nview\nof the\nview\nof the\nview\nof the\nview\nof the\nview\nof the\nview\nof the\n.\n.\n.\n.\nMr. Clerk, how about ring the bill?\nOkay members I'm going to give you some names we have some further actions\nthat we can complete tonight and the House is able to do just that by our rules\nso I'm going to make sure that Rep.
