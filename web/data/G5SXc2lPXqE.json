As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading\nand prayer by the chaplain,\nafter which we will pledge allegiance\nto the flag of our country.\nOur chaplain this morning,\nwe're very grateful for you being here.\nThank you very much.\nWe'll be introduced by the gentleman\nfrom the 46th House District,\nCameron Scott Hilton, Chairman Hilton.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nA lot more legroom back here.\nI like what you've done with the place.\nGood morning, colleagues.\nGod is good.\nAll the time.\nI'm so glad to see so many smiling faces in this house chamber.\nI pray that you and your communities\nmade it through the recent weather unscathed.\nIt is my true joy to introduce Father Charles Bird,\na true life-long native of Georgia.\nFather Bird hails from the Columbus area,\nwhere his father served at Fort Benning,\nHis father later moved into education\nand helped lead desegregation efforts out of Newton, Georgia.\nA true family man, Georgian father bird has one brother,\ntwo sisters, seven nieces and nephews across Georgia.\nHis career initially brought him to Louisville, Kentucky,\nworking in advertising.\nThere he converted to the Catholic faith\nand began serving in his local choir.\nThe Lord called father bird to pursue his faith further,\nleaving him to complete pre-theology and Pennsylvania\nand earn both his bachelors and license and sacred theology\nin Rome.\nIn Rome, he enjoyed the distinct honor\nbeing ordained as a deacon at St. Peter's Basilica\nby the future Pope, Pope Benedict.\nIn 2001, Archbishop Donahue ordained\nBird as a priest.\nToday, Father Bird is pastor of Mary R. Queen\nin peace-tree corners.\nA brief note about the church itself.\nIn 2019, Mary R. Queen completed a historic renovation\nbringing several items from St. Gerard Church,\na shuttered church in Buffalo, New York\nthat was built in 1911.\nThe result is a gorgeous historical structure\nright in the middle of Gwyneth County\nwhere many of our friends attend today.\nI would highly recommend you visit\nthis impressive historical structure.\nWith that, it is my distinct honor\nto recognize my good friend, Father Bird.\nMr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, in this assembly, it's my honor to be here.\nAgain, my name is Father Bird, I'm a Catholic priest in the Archdiocese.\nI've been a pastor for 13 years at the North Georgia Mountains.\nAnd now I'm in Gwyneth County and they're just a wonderful group of people.\nI'd like to tell you a brief story today and I hope that you'll find it interesting.\nI want to tell you a story about a beatification of five Georgians,\nwho the Catholic Church is about to recognize on their steps towards eventually being declared we pray.\nSaints, this is a big deal.\nThey were venerable Franciscans, four priests, one laborer,\nall from Spain, and their names are Pedro de Corpa,\nBlas Rodriguez, Miguel de An\u00f3n, Antonio de Badajos,\nand Francisco de Verascola, who is being toyed around\nwith considered as the patron, future patron saint of soccer.\nAnyway, good, interesting.\nThese fellows were 16th century missionaries\nin what is today the southern coast of Georgia,\nand they were martyrs.\nThey were not the first missionaries\nto be martyred in what is today Georgia,\nbut their cause has been pushed for decades\nto make its way through the long bureaucratic process\nthat has involved historical analysis,\nevaluation of their lives for virtue, details,\nand nature about their lives and death,\nand even potential miracles that may be attributed to them.\nThese Georgia martyrs were first recognized\nas venerable serfants of God,\nbut soon this autumn they will be designated\nas blessed in Savannah.\nAnd that's one step close to being named to Saint.\nThe process is hardly over,\nbut this last step is called canonization in the Catholic Church.\nAnd that means their names will be included\nin an ancient role of saints that go all the way back\nto Peter and Paul.\nBig deal, really.\nThe Native Georgians that these five missionaries served, or a lost tribe called the Wale, their\nmission churches are likely the oldest places of worship in Georgia, and it's very likely\nthat these Franciscans introduced peaches to what is today the peach state.\nAs the story goes, there were some among the Wale who rebelled against the Christian notion\nof monogamy, and for this a group of young men had about slaying the five men over the\ncourse of many days, and in five missions starting on the Feast of the Exaltation of\nthe Cross, which is September the 14th, 1597.\nIn the end, their rebellion failed, and the Wally Cheap asked for more French-esque\nmissionaries to come and replace their mortars. The Indigenous Wally lived for\ngenerations in those now lost missions and they are a people lost to history but\nnot to God. The reason for these mortadons is described as Odium Fidei in Latin\nhatred of the faith. But these men were anything but hateful. They were\nlearned, courageous, bold zealous. They lived among a new and strange people\nwithout knowing the language. They had no army of conquistadors to force\nconversions. They had only the convictions of their faith to inspire our first\nChristian and Georgians. 429 years ago, largely forgotten today, but about to be recognized\nby the church in Rome. The second century church historian Tertullian\nis credited for quoting, writing the quote, the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the\nchurch and he was likely referencing our Lord's words, Amen, Amen, unless a grain of\nwheat falls upon the ground and dies. It remains but a grain of wheat, but if it dies, it produces\nmuch fruit. What a proud past of sanctity. Georgia martyrs represent, and that begs the\nquestion, what will be our future? What seeds are re-nurturing? How are we cultivating\nour culture. When we die, will we leave the world a better place. Friends, whatever our\nfuture is, you are a part of it. We're counting on you and we're praying for you. Georgia\nis a beautiful state with a rich history and such great potential. And I hope that you\nwill get to know your Georgia mortars, blessed Pedro de Corba and companions. Now I would\nask you to stand for the benediction.\nGreat God of power and might who order all things according to your eternal will and\nto call all people to know and praise you.\nHear our prayer for those who serve in this August assembly.\nGuide them in your wisdom, may they be steadfast in your justice, and may they legislate and\ngovern always in moderation.\nMay they be honorable stewards of the authority and responsibility in which they have been\nentrusted.\nMay they never lose sight that all are meant to be governed by your laws and seek always\nyour mercy.\nWe thank you, Lord, for our state and for our people.\nMake us worthy of our rich heritage.\nIt was always in your providential care and bless this assembly, Lord, and their deliberations\non this day and the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.\nAmen.\nAnd now we'll make our pledge.\nOr keepers you may unlock the doors open the doors follow bird. Thank you for that\nfor that history lesson, but also most important lesson\nin our heritage and how we should act.\nThank you so much.\nThanks for being here.\nMembers, you may greet Father Bird in the south any room.\nyour gratitude for him being here and his message at the\nVotion.\nAwesome.\nThank you again, Father Bert.\nMembers, our doctor of the day was invited by none other than\nRepresentative Scott Holcomb.\nThank you, Representative Holcomb, for inviting Dr. Daniel Lopez, who is our physician of the day.\nSo if you need his services, you'll be downstairs.\nThanks.

Also, and this is bad, I hate to do too, but this Saturday night we had a tragedy in\nHarris County, our baseball coach, 44 years old, Tony Demetri was killed in an ATV accident,\nand he was with his best friend, so I don't know any details but other than we really need to pray\nfor his family, and I'd ask that you pray for the high school baseball team. He'd been\nthere a couple of years and gotten those young men in line and they had one, two, 23-game\nseasons, and just a tragic loss, and we ask that God be with their family, take care\nof them, and just say an extra prayer for them. So if you would, just a moment of silence\nfor these two.\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nThank you for representing Smith and members.\nY'all may be seated.\nI'm going to ask the remaining members that will have afternoon orders.\nIf you can hold it to about a minute and a half,\nI'll do the math for you.

At one time I\nknow there were over 250,000 Georgia power customers affected and I just spoke\na few moments ago with CEO Brian Ferguson of Habersham EMC and out of their 40,000\ntotal customers of which I am one over 30,000 without power at some point over\nthis past weekend, so this winter storm fern was extremely significant in our area.\nWe'd like to thank Governor Brian Kemp, President Donald J. Trump for their leadership and\nemergency declaration they had.\nWe'd like to thank Georgia Power, all the EMCs and utility partners in Georgia.\nThere was a force of over 10,000 people who converged on Georgia from different corners\nof the state and different states in the Union to help restore power and clear roads throughout\nGeorgia. We want to thank the Georgia Department of Transportation and their cooperation\nwith our local governments. We want to thank the Georgia Forestry Commission, GEMA,\nlaw enforcement, first responders, and we ask for your continued prayers for those that\nare still affected, still without power, and hopefully that restoration will be completed\nand done soon. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.\nThank you. Those folks do great work and we certainly did have some impactful weather.\nRepresentative Barry is recognized for an afternoon order. Representative Barry.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nColleagues, this morning I had an article placed in all your desks and I hope you had\nthe chance to get it.\nGentlemen, we'll continue now.\nI hope you had the chance to read the article I\nhad placed your desk this morning,\nbecause we got an inflection point.\nIn fact, we are far past an inflection point.\nWe are nearing the place of no return.\nI want you to have a classroom, rows of desk, empty desk,\nnot because kids are sick, not because parents don't care,\nbut because families are terrified.\nIn Atlanta, across Georgia, and across this nation,\nStudents are staying home because ICE rates and local cooperation with federal immigration\nenforcement have launched their campaign of terror and fear in weep to a daily condition\nof life. The unfortunate reality must face that this legislature has chosen to empower\nthis fear. The article points out clearly that this body doubled down on policies that\nblur the line between local law enforcement and federal immigration agents. Knowing full\nwell that when you do that, families stop trusting our schools and our public institutions.\nAnd at the top of it all sits the president who has allowed ICE to continue operating\nas a rogue agency that terrorizes communities instead of protecting them.\nI don't care the talking points about law and order, there is no order in a classroom\nwhere half the students are missing.\nThere is no law that is worth enforcing if the price of the child's education.\nWe cannot talk about parental rights while supporting policies that rip parents away.\nin the workforce readiness\nwhile sabotaging the education\nof an entire duration of students.\nAnd I must say, to anyone floundering in the polls\nfor U.S. Senate who invites ICE into Atlanta,\nit's not demonstrating leadership.\nThey are demonstrating a willingness\nto sacrifice children's safety for political theater\nand endorsement that is never gonna come.\nSo, we know that what we do at least of these,\nwe do also under him.\nHe tells us to walk in the stranger,\nhe tells us to walk in the stranger,\nto protect children and to act not out of fear,\nbut out of love.\nSo I invite you to consider joining the hospital for 70,\nwhich affirms that hospitals, hospitals,\nand churches are places of refuge, not fear.\nSo thank you all, education should not thrive\nor survive under terror, and neither should I.\nThank you all so much.\nThank you, Mrs. Speaker.\nWe're representing Ali to recognize for a afternoon.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nMembers of the House, I want to continue a tradition by my predecessor and introduce\na child that is up for adoption today.\nOn the screen is 13-year-old named Elizabeth.\nElizabeth enjoys learning math, watching gymnastics and doing arts and crafts.\nIf you or anyone in community is looking to adopt, please consider Elizabeth to become\npart of your family on it's my turn now dot dhs dot Georgia dot gov.\nThank you so much.\nThank you, Representative Oli.\nWe appreciate you doing that.\nRepresentative Hutchinson was a true champion and we appreciate you following up on that\ntradition.\nAnd if she's watching today, the best who we miss her, we welcome you, but we miss her\nas we all call.\nAnd she's doing, she's doing her duty, she's taking care of families, so we appreciate her very, very much, very much.\nRepresentative Paris,\nRepresentative Paris,\nrecognized for an afternoon order.\nAre you alone, you have friends?\nThe lady's recognized.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nSo, a couple of weeks ago, I got a little sick and had to take a minute to say this, let me introduce it.\nShe's back, we're glad you're back with us.\nThank you, thank you very much.\nThank you so much.\nHard me for interrupting.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nI just wanted to say thank you for your prayers.\nI could feel them.\nI knew that you all were thinking about me.\nIt was a little bit of a crazy little thing with my heart,\nbut the doctors said they think I'm OK.\nSo if I act out, that's what we're going to charge it to, right?\nBut I want to especially thank the GHDC for the flowers that they sent me to the Republican\ncaucus.\nI did not get flowers from you all.\nYou owe me.\nMrs. Speaker, thank you.\nEveryone, all of the phone calls, all of the text, all of the prayers, I really appreciate\nit.\nI was so, so, so heartfelt.\nThank you.\nMr. Speaker, thank you, thank you.\nRepresentative, you have a big heart and a caring heart,\nand we know your heart's fine.\nBut thank you for your service and appreciate you.\nWe're glad you're back.\nChairman Irwin recognized for an afternoon order.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nColleagues on your desk,\nyou're gonna see a book here from the Georgia Partnership\nfor Excellence in Education and for decades,\nthey put out the top 10 issues about education.\nI want to point out if you look at table of contents, one of the issues, literacy, something\nwe're going to spend a lot of time talking about in this chamber as well as we're going\nto put an effort to make a difference for our children.\nI just want you to imagine that if you could not read this book that I put on your desk\ntoday, how your life would be different.\nBut please pay a little attention to this book and the contents inside here.\nEducation Committee on Thursday at our meeting. Get ready. We're going to have these presented and we're going to talk more about them. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.\nThanks for the books and we appreciate your work and look forward to your work paying great dividends for Georgians. Thank you.\nChairman Crowe.\nChairman Clint Crowe is recognized for\nor an after-nord from down in Butch County?\nYes, sir.\nRight.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nGood morning, colleagues.\nAnd welcome back to everyone, glad that everyone made it through the weekend weather,\nrelatively unscathed.\nI want to come up here and talk to you just for a minute and give a bit of a different\nperspective.\nI heard my colleague a few moments ago talking about fear and terror and children not being\nin the classroom because of that.\nThere are some things that I would like to say that get misconstrued, especially in the\npress over the last several weeks.\nObviously, we have seen that there has been loss of life.\nThat is tragic.\nNone of us want that, and it is always tragic when someone loses their life.\nHowever, to come up here or to go anywhere and speak publicly, especially in a position\nlike we're in, where we make laws and then ask people to go out and enforce them and\nto vilify and mischaracterize those individuals.\nWe ask to go do that job as Nazis, as terrorists,\nand as Gestapo is not only wrong, it's dangerous.\nAnd so what I would like to say is that each one of these\nindividuals that has put their life on the line every day\nto go out and protect us and enforce the laws that we\nhave put in place, and our elected leaders have put\ninto place, are doing that at risk to themselves, sometimes\nrisk to their own families. We should respect them for that. We should honor them for that.\nWe should eradicate the ones that do it wrong. And we will do that. But that is the vast, vast,\nminority. And we don't need to lump all of them together and pain everybody with a broad brush.\nAnd the hyperbolic rhetoric that we hear about what they're doing and what kind of people they are\nis leading to dangerous situations that are leading to negative outcomes if people get hurt.\nSo I will continue to pray for all of our officers, local, state, and federal, and I ask you to do the same and honor the sacrifice that they make.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield the will.\nThank you, sir, that concludes the announcements.\nExcuse me, concludes the afternoon orders for the day.\nWe're going to move on to announcements.\nAnd here we go, so we have representative Jasmine Clark, representing Santos and Chairman Parrish.\nthat's the order, so we'll recognize President Clark as the first and represent San\nToes You're Next.
