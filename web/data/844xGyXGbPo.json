of the quotes that i found in\nresearching um mr moore\nis\nderek is very\nis the very best at taking insights of\nhis experiences as a professional\nfootball player and athlete and\ntranslating those experiences into\ncorporate business leadership and team\nbuilding environments to motivate and\ninspire audiences so i pray it is my\nprayer today that he he inspires us as\nwe go through the business of today's um\ntoday's activities and orders so\ncolleagues to\npresent to you today the chaplain of the\nday my homeboy from albany georgia derek\nmoore\nwell good morning\nit gives me\ngreat pleasure\nto serve as chaplain of the day and\naddress the georgia house of\nrepresentatives\nit's a real honor i'm humbled by it\ni want to thank you so tremendously for\ntolerating me for just\nthree to five minutes\nthank you the great state of georgia i\nwant to\nthank you for all the things you do on\nbehalf of our great state\nand representing us incredibly well\ni will say\nthat i enjoy bringing\npositive and good news\neven in what sometimes appear to be a\nbad news world\nthat there's still good news\nin a bad news world\nif you look hard enough and you look\nclose enough\ntypically it's\nseveral inches from our noses\nbut there is good news in a bad news\nworld\ni'm a georgia boy now\ninside and out\ni was born and raised down in albany\ngeorgia\nand i even currently have a daughter\nwho just graduated from the university\nof georgia\nand she'll actually be attending\ngraduate school\nat the university of georgia god willing\nthis fall\nnow everywhere i go and make\npresentations people ask me as a tech\nman where i've worked georgia tech for\nmore than two decades\nthey often ask me how in the world did i\nallow my daughter\nto go to georgia\nhow did\nmy lovely wife of now 27 years and i\nallow our daughter to go to athens\nfor undergraduate studies and now\ngraduate studies and i often respond to\nthat answer\nwith that is a classic example of what\nwe call bad parenting\nwell\nshe is uh\nmost proud of her experiences enjoy in\nathens at the university of georgia and\nkiddingly and jokingly i say that but i\nhave so many outstanding friends and uh\nand good pals over at the university of\ngeorgia\nand we've enjoyed her experiences these\nlast couple of minutes i want to give\nyou a south georgia phrase to take away\nand it's a phrase or a saying we've we\nsay quite a bit down in south georgia\nand it's probably very prominent in\nother places and it's usually it's when\nyou find yourself\nin a tough spot\ni don't know about you if you've ever\nfound yourself to be in a tough spot\nor in difficult circumstances some\npeople would classify it as being\nbetween a rock and a hard place where\nit's difficult and as you look into our\nculture currently we have a pandemic\non one hand and we've got social unrest\non another hand\nand then you look around and you've got\nevery other issue and circumstance under\nthe sun\nto still deal with on an ongoing basis\nand it appears to be what we call a\nperfect storm\na pandemic\nsocial unrest\nand all the other issues that's not only\nfacing our state but also\nour nation and world\nbut i'll tell you the good news\nif there was a way in it\nthere's a way out of it\nif there was a way in this mess or this\npickle\nthat we're in and down in south georgia\nwe call that\nbeing in a pickle\nyou wake up in the morning and read the\nnews and you turn on the television and\nyou see all of the the current reports\nabout this this pandemic and you look at\nthe social unrest issues and social\njustice issues taking place all around\nthe country and world\nand you say my god what a perfect storm\nand we stand there and i say\nif there was a way in this pickle\nthere is a way out of it\nthe bible talks about a way in these\nlast couple of minutes in john 14 and\nsix\nthe great bible man jesus according to\nchristian dome the christian faith and\none in which i still firmly hang my hat\njesus said to doubting thomas as he said\nmany things to him\nhe said to him as they reported then how\nshould we and how can we know the way\nout of this\nthis mess this pickle we find ourselves\nin how can we know\njesus said to him he says i am the way\ni am the way\nif there was a way in it there's a way\nout of it and in the grand scheme of\nthings\nhe says\nthe only way out of this mess is through\nme\nbecause he can take an ugly mess and\nturn it into a beautiful mess\nso here we are this morning\ndealing with this pickle we find\nourselves in\nbut the good news of the morning is that\nwe're going to get out of it\nand that isn't a single day that i wake\nup not believing it\nand if we're going to get out of it i\nwant to\nrecommend two things that we consider\nbecause those two things will serve as\nour exit\nout of this pickle i say that we're in\nand they'll prompt us to solve it\nwe've got to use our two ears to listen\nand our one brain to learn\nand if we listen and learn\nit provides a pathway out of\neven a pandemic even\nsocial unrest even every other\nchallenging item on your desk\nif we become people who use both of our\nears to hear\nand use our brains to learn\nwe can then find the right application\nin action steps necessary\nto go forward not only as a great state\nbut as a great people\nand i firmly believe that we are always\nbetter together than we can ever be a\npart\nwhen we come together as people\nreasonable sensible\nhuman beings\nwe then have the possibility of\ndiscovering\nwhere the exit out of this troubling\ninexperience that we are all dealing\nwith and are going through so i leave\nthat with you\nto listen and to learn and i close with\nmy tough person quote of the morning\nthat i tell my children\nwe raise them to be built for tough\ntimes and tough moments\nand we say tough\ntimes don't last but tough people do\nthat we will outlast\neven these dire circumstances that we\nall face\nand are quite honestly frightening\nexperiences\nand i challenge them with those quotes\neach morning i want to read the great\nnavy creed\nthey say that\nfor the navy diver that diving is the\nmost\ndangerous job\nin the navy\nthe navy diver is not a fighting\nindividual\nbut they are salvage expert\nif it's lost on the water\nthey find it\nif it's sunk\nthey bring it up\nif it's in the way they move it\ni don't know why anybody wants to be a\nnavy diver\ni\ni look at this pandemic and all of these\ntroubles\ni i don't know why anybody wants to be a\nrepresentative\nbut that's what we do\nthat's who we are we welcome the\nchallenge we welcome the difficulty\nbecause we are built for it and if\nyou're built for it we'll outlast it\nwe'll find a way out of it if there was\nan entrance there's an exit and i pray\nand hope that we keep\nlistening with both ears\nand we keep learning with our minds\nand we keep coming together as\nreasonable and sensible people and i\nassure you soon and very soon\nunpredictably we'll find ourselves on\nthe other side of these extreme\nsituations and then i'll give you one\nmore piece only to wake up the next day\nwith a few more\nif you

yesterday we had a\nradio talk show just get up and flat out\nlive\nlet me tell you what happened yesterday\nwe had a bill\nthat went through the committee over\nhere of the regulated industries\ncommittee and before the the bill was\neven voted out we had the radio talk\nshow host just coming up and saying\nsomething that's not true and he even\ntweeted it let me read it to you\nrepublicans in the georgia legislature\ngot democrats to support a casino in\nexchange for gutting\nthe hope scholarship\nwhich will exchange a portion from the\nbeing based on the academics of the\nstudent to how much money the parent\nmakes there is nothing further from the\ntruth let me tell you really quick what\npassed out of the regulated industries\nyesterday\nsports betting 100\nof the sports betting revenues 50 to 60\nmillion dollars goes to exactly the way\nthat goes today right through the\nlottery\nand ladies and gentlemen is distributed\nexactly the way that it's done\nthe new portion of the bill also created\ndestination resorts if and only if the\nstate of georgia puts it in the\nconstitution and if and only if your\nlocal district votes for it period\nwhat does it do\nfor the first time in our state's\nhistory it creates a lock box an\nemergency powers fund to be used only\nfor emergency number two it creates for\nfamilies that are 50 or below on their\nincome on new money from these\ndestination resorts and horse racing\nfor those median income folks those\nfolks that are foster kids that never\ncould afford even if they had a a\nscholarship from hope they couldn't\nafford to go to to go to school because\nof the difference in tuition and their\nin their hope or they couldn't afford\nhousing or books and fees or the mob\nthat's working two jobs by god they may\nable to get in the in pre-k because she\ndidn't get picked from the lottery\nladies and gentlemen that's the truth of\nwhat's happening yesterday shame on you\nand it's about time that we allow folks\nto vote because that's the core\nof jim crow is keep the people from\nvoting i yield well\nso let me see if i understand what you\nsaid mr chairman a radio\ntalk show host\ntold a lie\nis this the same one that's going to\nseminary\ntold a lie\ni don't i'm usually shelling peas at\nthat time of day and don't listen to\nthings like this\nbut\ni'm shocked\ni am truly shocked\nchair recognizes for a morning order\nchairman alan powell\nthank you mr speaker and ladies and\ngentlemen\nyou know i appreciate chairman stevens\ncoming down here and uh making\nmaking his commentary but i'm down here\nfor the generally the same reason i\nprobably won't be near as uh\nnear as uh\nverbal about some of this but i'm here\non behalf of the committee\nuh\ni don't know who this radio talk show\nhost is\nbut you know these these liberal uh\npersonalities\nthey get up and say anything\nand i don't know if this is a guy i\ndon't know anything about him\nbut he's apparently very liberal in his\npersuasion\nand\ni'm concerned about this\nbecause he's impugned the character the\nthe\nthis house and the regulated industries\ncommittee by\nplane spokenly passing out a lie\ni would in concern i'm more concerned\nthat these folks in the media\nand especially those of the more\nreligious that hide behind the religious\ncloak they need to read the eighth of\nthe ninth commandment depending on which\nversion that you're reading about\nabout basically misinformation lying\nbearing false witness\nchairman stevens talked about what was\nin the bill he was pretty well right he\nwas a little bit off on the figures\nbut we put money we designated in that\nif it's the will of the legislature to\nput it on the ballot for the people of\ngeorgia to vote for\nwe have constructed it as such\nthat all the sports betting money\ncan go to the lottery immediately\nthat's about 150 million\ndollars guesstimated\nand that would go a long way of helping\nthe lottery because we know how how they\ncan go through it like grist\nand then yes there was a\nand the other part of it where we put\nthe money\nwe created an emergency powers fund you\nknow a lot of us has been around we've\nalways been proud of the fact that we\nhad a shortfall reserve a rainy day fund\nbut folks that's not created\nconstitutionally or even statute\nwe just do it in the budget\nthis would create the emergency powers\nfund\nthat if the people of georgia\nchoose to allow\ndestination casinos\nsports betting horse racing\nand that's if they do it then that money\nwithin 10 percent of the previous year's\nrevenue would go to that lock box\nbasically\nto preserve the future of this state in\ncase we have another\ncatastrophic event like the pandemic\nand then the once filled up\nthen the bulk of that other money would\ngo to the opportunity fund that would be\nbased on the legislature creating those\nfolks under the 58 percentile range of\nincome\nfor pre-k or needs-based\nscholarships or even better needs-based\nloans but you know that's what will\nhappen in the bulk goes into the general\nfund\nnow that being said ladies and gentlemen\ni understand and the reason i'm here\nthis

the hospital association and asked\nthem to prepare for the second wave\nwe're still on the first wave\nthis has not gone down not ever\nit's been told that we test more and\nthat's why the numbers are up if we test\nmore\nbut the percentage of positives\nremains the same\nwe still have a problem\nwe still have a problem but what we're\ntelling people is that everything is\nokay\ni'm a small business owner things can't\nbe closed forever but i think it's\nirresponsible of us\nto tell the people of georgia that the\nthat this crisis is either diminished or\ngoing away and that they should take\nless measures to keep themselves safe\nthe hospital beds are going up the\ndeaths are going up we lose an average\nof 33 lives in georgia every single day\nbut\nwe\nare in the summer\nwe have pool parties and beaches and i\nam terrified that these numbers are\ngoing to continue to go up we are not\ngoing to have a second wave we'll\ncontinue the wave we've been going on\nthank you mr

senator ligand iii\nkennedy the 18th hillary the 19th of\ncouncil of the 46th\nhe titled an act to amend title 44 the\nofficial george annotated relating to\nproperty\nchose to prohibit amendments to property\nowners association instruments and\ncovenants that restrict rental of\nresidential lots and plots\nthis bill had been referred to the\ncommittee\nthis this hadn't been referred to the\ncommittee on judiciary that committee\nrecommends that this bill do pass by\ncommittee substitute\nchair recognizes representative washburn\nto present the bill\nthank you mr speaker\nladies and gentlemen the house i'm here\nto present senate bill 442 and there is\na judiciary committee substitute\nthis bill has to do with property owners\nassociation\nchanging rules\nrelative to the leasing\nof real estate that is owned\nwhen you or anyone buys a piece of real\nestate\nyou certainly buy the property and you\nbuy the rights and privileges to go with\nthat\ntwo basic rights are the right to sell\nit\nand also the right to convey it with a\nleasehold interest or to lease it out\nthis bill is simple\nit simply\nrequires that the rules can't be changed\nin the middle of the game\nproperty owners association can change\ntheir rules with a two-thirds majority\nthis bill prohibits them from being able\nto change those rules\non someone who owns real estate within\nthat property owner association's\njurisdiction\nit does not pertain to any\nshort-term rentals\nand it does allow that if the property\nis sold that the new owner would be\nbound by those rules that prohibit the\nleasing of it\nthis has to do with private property\nrights and it has to do with fairness\nif you\nor maybe one of your children happen to\nown a piece of real estate\ncontrolled by a property owners\nassociation let's say your son or\ndaughter lives down in savannah and\nthey've bought that first home\nand so then they get an offer of a good\njob in atlanta\nand so they move\nwell maybe the housing sale market is\nnot so good right now\nand so they have a big old mortgage\npayment to make they got to pay taxes\nand insurance they got to maintain the\nproperty\nand if if they were allowed to if it was\nallowed that they could be prohibited\nfrom leasing that property\nthey would not be able to lease it\nthis is a fair bill\ni do understand that there are concerns\nin some communities i've had some emails\nabout things where people have some\nneighbors who are causing problems and\nhappen to be tenants\nwell in my experience for a long time as\na real estate broker\nand a property owner\nyou can have trouble some neighbors\nbut they might be property owners and\nnot necessarily just not necessarily\ntenants\nand so this bill is good for property\nowners because it protects their right\nto lease property it is also good for\ntenants\nmost every one of us unless we're born\ninto great wealth\nhave been tenant at some time i have and\nmost of you have\nand so to\ncharge that all tenants are bad or\ntroublesome\nis not fair\nthis is a good bill\nand i urge you a favorable consideration\nof it mr speaker i'll be glad to take\nany questions\ni don't think you

i\nbring to you today senate bill 435 also\nknown as the survivor's first act\nand previously known as the debbie vance\nact who\npassed away unexpectedly last may\nwho was one of our courageous victim\nsurvivors of human trafficking\npart of our state's priority\nis to give victims of human trafficking\nand opportunity to move forward with\ntheir lives after they have\nescaped\nvictims of human trafficking often come\nout with criminal arrests and\nconvictions for offenses ranging from\nprostitution to drug-related offenses to\nshoplifting\nthese convictions can prevent these\nvictims\nfrom moving ahead with their lives it\ncan they can prevent them from getting a\njob\nhousing and an education\nthis bill authorizes the vacating and\nsometimes the lesser\nof restricting of reporting of\nconvictions and sentencing for those who\nhave obtained them as a result of being\na victim of human trafficking for labor\nor sexual servitude\ntwo years ago\nthe street grace survivor advisory board\nmet to discuss human trafficking policy\nchanges that were needed in our state\nand they identified this bill as their\npriority policy\nnot only did these survivor leaders\nidentify this as their key policy\nprovide priority but they brought this\nidea to first lady kemp\nand then sat with attorneys in the\ngovernor's office to help craft the key\ndetails of this legislation\nthis legislation\nis a great example of our legislature\nlistening to the human trafficking\nsurvivors and overcomers who have\nfirst-hand expertise in this area\nand is being held up nationally as an\nexample of the good that can come\nwhen survivors are not just invited to\nthe table\nto exploit them for their moving stories\nbut are treated as the experts that they\ntruly are\ni have a statement from\nthe street grace survivor advisor\nboard co-chair nikki burrell\nshe says as a trafficking survivor\nmyself\ni understand the importance of having to\nrebuild my life after severe complex\ntrauma\npart of my trauma while i was trafficked\nincluded an arrest and i am not alone in\nthis\nmany many trafficking survivors have\nbeen arrested while being forced to\ncommit crimes during the duress of their\nexperience\njust to survive their everyday life\nconsider if it were your son\ndaughter niece nephew granddaughter or\ngrandson who was caught in the arms of a\ntrafficker\nand had no way to survive\nbut to do\nwhat he or she was told to do\nwhich was prostitution petty crimes etc\ntrafficking victims often feel there is\nno choice involved other than the choice\nto stay alive\nonce given the opportunity to escape\nsurvivors are given the opportunity for\na brand new start some of them need help\nrebuilding their lives which includes\ngetting a job a home a checking account\nthings that most of us take for granted\noften after years of restorative care\nour victims have trouble getting any of\nthese things because of their criminal\nrecords\nbut ladies and gentlemen the survivors\nfirst act will allow these victims to\nbreak past their barriers that stop them\nfrom living their everyday life\nit's our civic duty\nand our moral responsibility

official\ngeorge annotator relating to waste\nmanagement so as to eliminate the coal\nash surcharge this bill had referred to\nthe committee on natural resources\nenvironment that committee recommends\nthat this bill do pass\nby committee\nsubstitute ladies and gentlemen of the\nhouse for the final time\nchair recognizes\nrepresentative terry rogers to present a\nbill in this case it's senate bill 123.\nthank you mr speaker um yeah this is\nkind of tough final bill\nbut uh it uh it's a very aptly name bill\nit's uh senate bill 123 that's sb123 and\nit's a simple bill\nand it's as easy as one two three\nso there you go\num three parts to this bill i'm gonna\naddress uh two of them you know fairly\nmuch in depth and then i think that\nwe're going to have another member\nthat's going to speak to the second part\npart one it's a natural resources bill\nand it deals with hazard's waste solid\nwaste things of that nature part one is\nlandfills most of you who live in rural\ncounties know how important landfills\nare\na couple of years ago a long time ago\nmatter of fact in 1997 the house uh\npassed a bill and said it's going to\ncome back to haunt us but we're going to\ndo it anyway\nthey moved the\nthey moved to where you could not\nexpand the landfill more than two miles\nor or you had to be two miles away from\na uh\nmilitary installation and um that had\nbombing ranges\nand as you guys know things have changed\nand what this bill does it's if if you\nare an improved landfill as of 1997\nand going forward you can now expand uh\nyour limits right there this is\nespecially important to a lot of\ncounties rural counties because we all\nknow how important\nlands are land is right now and so what\nthat does it does that\nit just goes ahead and expands that\ntakes care of that problem that was\ncreated 30 years ago\nsecond thing\nit deals with is coal ash\nand\nbasically what we're doing on the coal\nash is right now it's a dollar per ton\nit fluctuates\nuh what this will do is make coal ash\ntwo dollars and fifty cents a ton\nand then twenty percent of that will go\nback uh to um\nto the counties for remediation for some\nreally good programs such as\nrecycling things of that nature\neducation cleanup and i think\nrepresentative meeks is going to speak\nto that\nand then the third thing is a bill that\nuh hb 926 that passed out of natural\nresources unanimously\nuh\nand then somehow another got caught up\nduring all the covet stuff and did not\nget on the floor so\nhb 926 is put on there it is the solid\nwaste fund and the hazardous waste fund\ntrust fund\nand basically what it does is it makes\nsolid waste\n75 cents a ton and then um and then\ntires\nuh a dollar per tire\nthese funds will be used to maintain um\ncleanups things of that nature and i\nwant to give a special\nshout out when it went through the\ncommittee it was very much of a\nnonpartisan sort of thing\ndemocrats on the committee as well as\nrepublicans looked and said hey there\nneeds to be better transparency on this\nthing and so what we're doing is we\nalready had a report coming from epd to\nthe natural resources committee that\ntalked about where the money was being\nspent\nand\nfor\nfor uh hazardous waste but it didn't\nhave it for solid waste so we've\nput that into the bill to where now\nsolid waste will report back and give a\nfull thing give a full accounting so\nthat's the bill in a nutshell uh it's a\npretty simple bill\nit's a good bill it generates a lot of\nmoney that does a lot of good things i'm\nvery excited about the fact that 20 are\ngoing back\nto education programs things of that\nnature and mr speaker that's pretty much\nit\ni do not yeah you have a question do you\nyield yes sir\nchair recognizes representative jasmine\nclark up in the gallery to your right\nyes ma'am\nyes ma'am\nlc um you're reading from\nwhat lc number yes\nyou know\nit is lc411518s\ni do not have a copy of that\nin our notebook so that's the reason i\nwas asking okay yes ma'am this was a\nsubstitute that we did because there was\na glitch in the thing and i will add\nalso that what this does is it sunsets\non the solid waveness and the hazardous\nwaste in 2025 and that was what the uh\nthat's probably what the real substitute\nwas\nokay\nthank you thank you ma'am\ndo you further yield\nyes sir chair recognizes representative\nkirby\nin room 341.\ndo i have to take that\nthe the 341 caucus objects to that\nrepresentative rogers so\nwill you yield yes sir\njust a simple question if i understand\nright without the passages of this bill\nis this the one that's going to leave us\na big hole in the budget that we\nthis bill is going to fill uh it would\nleave about a 20 billion dollar hole in\nthe budget that is correct\nokay so passing this bill will close\nthat 20 million hole for us uh it will\ngo a long way yes it's my understanding\ni'm not certain of the exact number\nthat's the last number that i saw on it\nthank you sir thank you\nyou have one more question if you care\nto yield yes sir i yield for one more\nchair recognizes representative carter\nup in the gallery\njust to the right of the middle yes\nyes ma'am would you please repeat the\nlc number i believe we have the wrong\none\nuh the lc number that i have in front of\nme is lc441518s\nyes ma'am\nwould it be possible if you would allow\nus to receive the bill table this is\nsomething or is that a question\ni think i think the\nthe reality of the situation is if there\nis a little bit of confusion there right\nthere the only thing might be with it\nwith a date change on it i really don't\nthink it has a\na um\nwe had some we had some language in here\nthat went from 2019 to 2020 that had not\nbeen updated that would have been the\nonly thing would have been updated\nlanguage quite frankly ma'am i just\ndon't believe it would have an impact on\nthe bill\nfurther yes ma'am\nisn't that true that there is an\nexcessive amount of landfills that are\nin black communities\nma'am i could not answer that\nfurther yes ma'am for one more\nand\nin my area alone we're seeing an excess\nof\nrecycling and landfills that directly\naffects the health of our community so\ncould you help me understand what's the\nbenefit of passing this legislation\nyou're talking about the legislation\nregarding the landfills yes ma'am one of\nthe things that is\nis a good thing about this if you're\ntalking about the expansion of the\nlandfills\nit's because of the fact that\notherwise people would be forced to go\nout and to buy more expensive properties\nsomewhere else this is just a complete\ntotal thing i think what you'll see is a\nbenefit there of reduced taxes and\nprobably if they're expanding more jobs\ncreated i do not believe it will have a\nhealth impact because of because the uh\nlandfills are already there\nso mr speaker\nyou have another question but to the\nrepresentatives\nthat\nwere concerned about not having the\nproper\nlc number there's a table outside the\ngallery\nwith the\ncopies of legislation on it so uh\nyou might want to check that\nyou have another question if you yield\nif you care to you\ni'll yell for one more chair recognizes\nrepresentative al williams to your left\nfor a question\ni knew that i could not get out of here\nwithout hearing from my good friend\nyes sir i miss saying this but\ni do know that there is\na landfill bill\nthat directly impacts macintosh county\nthat is attached to it it's part of\nmcintosh county that i used to represent\nbut is it not true\nthat this landfill is 10 miles from the\nclosest house\nand sits next to the bombing range from\nthe beaufort air station and there will\nbe no impact on the african-american\ncommunity in macintosh county i will\nyield to the wisdom of my friend from\nliberty county\nwho knows a thing or two about macintosh\ncounty too i tell you what\nmr speaker with that\ni\nwould ask for your favorable\nconsideration this bill it's a good bill\ncloses a tremendous gap in the budget it\ndoes some good things i love the fact\nthat there was non-po there was partisan\nnonpartisan participation throughout the\nwhole bill it benefits all of georgia\nand i would\nlike to end by asking for your vote\nand your favorable consideration of sb\n123 and i think at this time i will\nyield the well and turn it over to\nrepresentative mix\nthat's my job\nyour job is just to yield a well mr\nspeaker at this time i think i'm just\ngoing to yield the boil and let you do\nyour job\nchair recognizes representative meeks to\nspeak to the bill\nthank you mr speaker ladies and\ngentlemen i appreciate the opportunity\nto come before you today to offer a few\nwords on senate bill 123\nsenate bill 123 also includes the\nlanguage of house bill 959\nwhich was voted on this body earlier\nthis year by a vote of 162-1\nthis portion of the bill deals with the\ntipping fees of coal ash which is a very\nimportant issue and my district at home\nand very important to the the people of\nwayne county and surrounding counties it\nsimply does nothing more than raise the\ntipping fee to 2.50 per ton which was a\ndelay in implementation of legislation\nthat was passed by this body more than\ntwo years ago\ngiven that\nthere are other facilities around the\ncountry that bearing mandated to be\nexcavated and cleaned up we certainly\ndon't want the out-of-state coal ash to\ncome to our state so i would urge a\nfavorable consideration on house bill or\nsenate bill 123 and mr speaker unless we\nhave a question are you at the well\nyou have a question if you care to yield\nyes sir mr speaker\nchair recognizes the majority leader

to provide for alternative\nmeetings locations and our alternative\nmeeting means in certain emergency\nsituations i'll go through the bill\nthe substitute\nsection one\nthis language has been added to clarify\nlanguage already in the constitution\nthat the houses need the consent of both\nchambers both chambers before they can\nmeet somewhere other than this capital\nor\nadjourn for more than three days without\nthe consent of the other chamber that's\njust clarifying language\nnow the language in section one that's\nbeen added\nwhen it is difficult or impossible\nto meet in the capital because of an\nemergency affecting the state due to\nenemy attack\nnatural or man-made disaster or pandemic\nthe general assembly can meet through\nelectronic means or at another location\nsubject to

certainly\nthat already exists in our constitution\ncurrently the general assembly is able\nto suspend the rules that apply\nto it in in the georgia constitution\nonly when a disaster is caused by an\nenemy attack\nthis section is being amended to allow\nfor the general assembly to suspend the\nlegislative rules in the georgia\nconstitution when there is an enemy\nattack\nnatural or man-made disaster or pandemic\nand certainly when the general assembly\ndeems it necessary to do these to do to\nthese circumstances\nthis\nsection is this is this language is\nsimilar to the emergency powers\nthat the governor can be granted and\nensures that we the general assembly can\ncontinue its function and carry out its\nresponsibilities in the same way the\ngovernor can under his emergency powers\nthis simply helps us to maintain the\nbalance of power in the system of checks\nand balances between the branches of\ngovernment especially important to times\ndue in emergency situations\nthe last section section 3 simply states\nthe language that would be on the ballot\nshall the constitution of georgia be\namended so as to provide that the\ngeneral assembly may meet in places\nother than

recognizes\nthe chair of the public safety and\nhomeland security committee chairman\nhitchins\nto carefully and thoroughly explain\nthe senate substitute to house bill 838\nthank you mr speaker\ni know that you just got a copy of this\nand i'll\nbe very honest with you i got a copy of\nit about five minutes ago and uh it's uh\nit's a very very detailed bill\nif you look at the first part of it up\nto section four it's the original bill\nthat passed this house before we\nwent on break\nbefore crossover\nand what it was was a bill some of you\nprobably remember three or four years\nago i had a bill that was passed here\ncalled the\npeace officer the public safety officer\nsupport bill and what it did was it\nprovided services for\npersonnel law enforcement officers\nfiremen emt 911 operators\nwho were involved in number one in\ntraumatic incidents somebody was killed\nthey were in a shooting they\nhad to remove some\ndead child from a\nhome that had been burnt\nand and we had a lot of a lot of people\ncome forward with some\nwith some first-person stories in our\ncommittee hearings and\nwe ended up getting that passed\nand uh\ni think it's been very effective for the\nlast couple years the the organization\nnow routinely goes out to these\nevents when they occur and if they\naren't successful\ni started it in the department of public\nsafety in 2005.\nand we had a guy there that was very\nfortunate that had a master's degree in\nclinical psychology and was a licensed\nclinical psychologist so we put him in\ncharge of that and he's done a great job\nwith it\ni was notified this year\nthat by legislative council\nthat they thought there was some errors\nin this bill\nand if you'll notice on page one and a\nlittle bit on page two\nin several places you see public safety\nofficer support\nand officers deleted\nwhat they said was that if there was any\ncontroversy in the future\nthat\nperhaps firemen\nemts\nand 9-1-1 operators wouldn't be eligible\nfor this service\nbecause it said officer and that\ntypically means a law enforcement\nofficer\nso i introduced a bill i think it passed\nhere\nwith very few negative comments or or\nvotes\nand then uh\ntoday i get this amendment\nwhich begins in section five\nand i'm gonna read the verbatim since\nyou just got it but it says a peace\nofficer should have the right to bring a\ncivil suit against any person\ngroup of persons organization or\ncorporation\nor the head of a corporate organization\nor corporation for damages either\nconcunary or otherwise suffer during the\nofficer's performance of official duties\nfor abridgement of the officer's civil\nrights arising under the officer's\nperformance of official duties or for\nfiling a complaint against the officer\nwhich the person knew was false when it\nwas filed\nnow i think all of you know i spent 43\nyears in public safety in a very variety\nof different capacities from the state\npatrol to\nthe governor's criminal justice\ncoordinating council and as georgia's\nfirst homeland security director\nprior to the mid 80s\nthese types of complaints were he said\nshe said\nwe had somehow\ninterviewed people investigate the facts\nas we knew them\nand make a subjective decision about who\nwas right and who was wrong\nin\n1985 i was the post commander of the\nstate patrol office in savannah\nand they wanted to try out cameras\nand vehicles\nand i volunteered to be\none of the posts where we did it on\nexperimental basis\ni had a trooper down there who probably\nmade more\ndrug arrests on i-95 you know it was the\nmain through fair it used to be that\nmost of the drugs coming out of south\namerica would come through miami and\nthen they would be distributed by 95 all\nthe way to new york and\nmaine\nhe\nhe caught a load of drugs about every\nevery third night\nand uh\nso we put the camera in his car because\ni wanted to see number one how he was\ndoing it\nuh to make sure that he wouldn't violate\nanybody's rights or saying anything that\nhe shouldn't say and\nand he didn't have it about four nights\nand he shot a guy\nand uh\nyou know\nthe attorney for the other fellow and\nthe media were all on us about uh\nunjustifiable shooting\nwell there was a camera in the car and\nnobody knew anything about him at that\ntime\nwe pulled the video and watched it and\nthe commissioner came down at that time\nand we watched it\nand it was the passenger wasn't a driver\nand it was loaded with dope\nbut what happened was the passenger fell\nout with his right leg had a gun in his\nhand\nand the trooper told him 21 times on\ntape to drop the gun\nand when he didn't drop the gun\nhe started a forward movement and the\ntrooper shot him\nfortunately the guy survived but\nyou know i have no idea what would have\nhappened with that case if we hadn't had\na camera shortly thereafter\nwe put cameras in all our cars and uh\nyou know\nit uh it's been it's been a very\npositive thing from two perspectives\nprimarily that we actually see what what\ntranspires but it protects the officer\nwhen he does the right thing\nand it allows us to take action against\nhim when he's done the wrong thing\nand uh\ni've found several cases on both sides\nwhere we probably wouldn't come to that\ndecision that we not had the camera\ni had a\nfella to work for me\nand most of you in here know him and i'm\nnot going to mention any names\nal williams\nno no but\nhe worked up in blue ridge a place many\nof you have probably heard of through\nthe years here but he wrote a lady a\ncitation\nand\nwhen he went to court the trooper\noutlined the case and asked the lady\nwhat she had to say\nand she said basically she may have been\nspeeding she wasn't sure\nbut the trooper made some improper\nsuggestions to her that she was offended\nby\nand they had a lady judge\nand she questioned the trooper and said\nwhat in the world were you doing\nhe said i wasn't doing anything\nand if you'll give me 45 minutes till i\ncan go get an nco to get the tape\nout of storage in our evidence locker\ni'll bring it back and you can watch it\nand that occurred and when the judge\nwatched it in her chambers and came back\nout\nshe sends the lady for to two weeks in\njail for for lying about what happened\nbecause none of that ever occurred\nand i had another case and i know i'm\ngoing on and on here but\nthat occurred in emanuel county\nand a\na preacher that i knew very well\ncalled me\nand accused a\ntrooper who had stopped his friend from\nspeeding he was following along in\nanother car but he said he got out and\nhe listened to it and the trooper was\nvery obviously racist\nand i knew him i knew the trooper and i\ndidn't believe it to be the case and\nso he said what are you going to do\nabout it i said we're going to\ninvestigate it he said what do you mean\ninvestigate how are you going to do that\ni said the first thing we're going to do\nis pull the tape recording\nof what actually\noccurred\nhe said what do you mean a tape\nrecording i said oh our cars are\nequipped with tapes\nand whatever occurred there will be\npretty obvious to us when we look at it\nso i had him pull the tape\nand\nnothing happened\nthe preacher and his acquaintance were\nvery unhappy about getting a citation\nbut he hadn't done a thing\nand\nand i say that to say we had one more\nand i could go on all day\nmy wife take your time now\njohn burns knows it but my wife once\nsaid i can talk the longest and say the\nleast of anybody she knows but\nand as we go further into this you'll\nsee what i'm talking about but we had\nanother one down in cordeal\nwhere they uh they arrested a\nan individual for drunk driving\nabout five years previous we had had a\nsimilar incident down there where the\nguy had pulled a gun and shot and killed\nthe chief of police down there\nand uh and one of our troopers and\ninjured injured the sheriff in the jail\nand\n[Music]\nalthough he uh\nhe got the death penalty out of it i uh\nin the second case\nwell after he was already arrested for\ndui and they were escorting him to the\njail cell the guy sucker punched the\ntrooper broke his nose and jaw\nand uh we were prohibited\nby rule from suing and i just thought it\nwas uh it was dastardly uh\ncertainly he deserved to be sued and\nluckily workman's comp paid for it but i\nthought he ought to get some damages\nfrom something that\nshould have never occurred\nnow section five\nis a little\na little more stringent\nsection six i'm sorry\nno it's the end of section five it's\nsection six\ni just got this\nas usual in this code section it refers\nto first responder\nwhich means any firefighter municipal\ncounty or volunteer fire department a\npeace officer is defined in code section\nand an emergency medical technician\na person commits the offense\nof bias motivated intimidation when such\nperson maliciously and with a specific\nintent to intimidate harass or terrorize\nanother person\nbecause of that person's actual or\nperceived employment as a first\nresponder\ncauses death or serious bodily harm to\nanother person or causes damage to or\ndestroys any real or personal property\nof a person because of actual perceived\nemployment as a first responder without\npermission and the amount of the damage\nexceeds 500 of the value of the property\ndestroyed exceeds 500\nany person violates subsection b of this\ncode should be guilty of the offense of\nbiased motive intimidation upon\nconviction thereof should be punished by\nimprisonment i'm not less than one or\nmore than five\na fine of not more than five thousand or\nboth\nso you could say it becomes a\nfelony\nbut it's a serious thing and it occurs\nall the time to law enforcement officers\nand much less infrequently to\nfiremen\nbut i've had people come to my house on\nseveral occasions because i've had some\ndealings with them and\nin the law enforcement capacity\nand i'm pretty proud of my record in 43\nyears i had one complaint and it\noccurred on the first day i was on the\nroad by myself\nand the complaint the complainant said\nhe didn't like getting a ticket\nso uh you know i've dealt with thousands\nand thousands of people and\nin a lot of variety of different uh\ninstances and many very emotional\nand i've always thought i was fairly\ngood at verbal judo and\nbeing able to minimize what was going on\nnow some people you just can't do it\nwith\nbut\na lot of our law enforcement personnel\nacross the state are\nare subjected to\na lot of uh\nuh\nwhat would be criminal activity if this\npasses\njust because they're they do what they\ndo\nand i can go on i had one up in\nup in madison just before i retired\nand they they got into a chase and had a\nshootout\nand uh the guy was shooting at them and\nthe covington police asked to ask for\nthe troopers to come help\nand uh the trooper ended up shooting and\nkilling the guy\nwell his brother was in prison\nuh and this guy had been in prison\nbefore\nand the gbi told us that through the\nprison system they got word that he put\nout a contract on the trooper\nthey live in the same little town about\ntwo miles apart and they see each other\nat walmart around the shopping centers\nall the time\nand every time he saw him he made\nthreatening gestures or remarks\nand my understanding is if this passes\nsomething like that can be dealt with i\ndon't know that you get one to five but\ncertainly they ought to be circumvented\nfrom\nfrom being able to threaten or\nintimidate based on a job\ni'm looking at the minority leader and i\nknow i was involved in a case over in\nstatesboro\ni'm going to tell you a lot after we get\ndone here today\nbut\nhe had he'd represented a fellow who got\nfive years in prison\nand after the guy came back got out he\ncame to his office\nuh pulled a pistol on him and we spent\nthree days negotiating before we got him\nreleased\nuh\nand he really thought that he was gonna\ntake care of him but uh\nyou probably see his ads on tv all the\ntime if you live in the savannah area\nhe's got an add-on about every 30\nminutes now\nbut\nand i say that to say\nthese are routine issues\ni know some people don't uh\ndon't think that\nand i've heard many people say it\nthat's part of their job\ni really don't think it's part of their\njob to be subjected to that kind of\ntreatment on a regular basis\nuh we're going to leave it up to you\nhere today to decide whether it is or\nnot and\ni just asked for your favorable\nconsideration i think it's\na lot of things going on in our society\ntoday and\ni've often said here really that\nthe pillars that uh uphold our society\nhave some serious cracks in them and i i\nworry about\nwhat's going to transpire in the coming\nyears and\nbut i offered up for you\ni asked for your favorable consideration\nand i'd be glad to take any questions\ndo yield for questions\nmr chairman yes i yield\ndo you need a bottle of water no i'm\ni'm good to go all right\nchair recognizes\nthe minority leader leader trammell to\nyour left for a question\nthank you mr speaker will the gentleman\nyield sure\nisn't it true that the law already\nprovides\nspecific penalty enhancements or crimes\nin in the case when those crimes are\nagainst police officers and first\nresponders\nuh\ni think they're very limited\nin certain cases\nwill the gentleman further you know sure\nisn't it true that the list of crimes\nalready in statute include aggravated\nassault upon a public safety officer\nabout discharge of a firearm aggravated\nassault upon a public safety office\nwithout discharge a firearm and does not\ninvolve only the use of a person's body\naggravated assault upon a public safety\nofficer only involving the use of a\nperson's body aggravated assault by\nstrangulation of law enforcement simple\nbattery against police officer\naggravated battery upon a public safety\nofficer obstructing of an officer felony\nobstruction of an officer fell in the\nobstruction of an officer by throwing\nhuman or animal bodily waste removal or\nattempted removal of a weapon from a\npeace officer user of laser devices\nagainst the law enforcement officer and\nsimilar crimes against first responders\nand firemen\nthat's correct but it's it's uh\nthe specific charge is already there but\nit's much like another bill that we're\ngoing to\nlook at here probably in the next day or\ntwo that the charge is already in place\nbut uh they're trying to add some some\nadditional charges based on\nsex race culture\n[Music]\nreligion\ndo you further you i do\nchair recognizes representative wolinski\nup in the gallery in the middle\nthank you speaker does the gentleman\nyield sure\nuh i first like to let you know that i\nam a\ncivil attorney so i knew that new civil\nclaims i would be very excited about but\ni'm concerned\nabout one thing on page two\nas i read lines 15-53\nit reads a peace officer shall have the\nright to bring a civil suit against any\nperson yada yada listed more\nsuffer during the officer's performance\nof official duties\nwhat does that mean\nwell\ni would think that it would mean that\nthere are many things said that are\ncaptured on tape that are very\nderogatory and\npretty explicit from time to time and\ni think if if that occurs\ni think right now they have the\ncapability the problem is many law\nenforcement agencies and and ours was\none of them has a policy manual and it's\nthat thick about additional rule and\nregulations that you have\nwith regard to how you carry out your\nduties and they prohibit\nthis type of activity does it generally\nyield sure sure\njust as i read again right to bring a\nsuitable suit against any perfect\nsuffered during the officer's\nperformance\nwhat is suffered what is the claim there\nwell i think it's uh\ndeflamatory\non in many cases when\ni've been called a lot of names other\npeople been called names\nand it\nuh i certainly wasn't in the performance\nof a law enforcement duty but i got uh\ni was\nhad somebody say in a\nfish in an article here in\natlanta uh last week that i was a card\ncarrying member of a terrorist\norganization\nand i took great offense at that\ni've worked my whole life and i was an\nintelligence officer in the military for\nmany years working against terrorism and\ni thought that was pretty deflammatory\nthank you\nchair recognizes representative mclaren\nto\nyour left up in the gallery well\ngentlemen yield\nsure\nspeaking to this civil cause of action\nthat we've been discussing\ni'm concerned a little bit about\nwhat might be some vagueness in this\nlanguage\nwhich you know over the last couple\nyears i've been a little concerned about\nhow easy it is to get some lawsuits in\nsituations where we might not want them\nso i guess my question is\nfirst\nwhat is what are an officer's civil\nrights is there a definition for that\nanywhere because\ncould that mean any insult to an officer\nthey could sue for\ni don't think it would mean any insult\nbut i think it goes to a certain degree\nand\nto be very honest you know this i didn't\nwrite this\nthis was an amendment that came over\nfrom the senate i'm trying to defend my\npart of the bill that\nthat\ndeals with a lot of other issues that i\nthought were very beneficial\njim and yield for one final question\nsure just regarding the other part of\nthis civil action that i was trying to\ndraw attention to it says any person\ngroup of persons organization or\ncorporation\nbut i don't see any language regarding\ncausality trying to connect those groups\nto the injury and so i guess my concern\nis\nif an employer gives a group of people\nday off from work to go participate in a\nprotest and somebody does something dumb\ncan you just file a lawsuit against\nevery group that that person is\naffiliated with\ni wouldn't think so but you're the\nlawyer\ni guess it's an open question thank you\nchair recognizes um representative\nstovall\nin room 341.\nthat's the gentleman yield\nare you\nuh is it not true that the legislators\nshould have been included in this bill\nfor\nfor the votes that we might take at the\nlegislative\ngeneral assembly\nthat may be offensive to others\nuh just as i said a minute ago i didn't\nwrite this bill i'm dealing with what uh\nwith what i was handed\nmy i certainly understand your concern\nbut i don't have the ability\nto deal with that\nthank you\nchair recognizes\ni think i've had enough mr speaker\nokay one more\none more\nyes sir okay\ni'm glad you said one more because\nthe chair recognizes the majority leader\nof the house leader burns to your right\nfor a question\ngentlemen yield\nmr chairman it's always amazing to me\nwhen you uh and i've heard it several\ntimes and to be quite frank and honest\nabout it it's always amazing to me for\nyour life experiences that you've been\nthrough\nin your career as a public servant\nin public safety in the situations that\nyou um have encountered\nand is it not true\nmr chairman that you've always treated\neveryone that you've encountered\non the road or in this in this body\nwherever the situation may be in\nleadership roles with respect and that's\nwhat you've demanded of the public\nsafety officers that you've\ncommanded over the years i like to think\nthat you know i had great hesitation\nwhen i was asked to run for this slot\nbecause uh i worked 20 years on the road\nin in my hometown area and uh\ni run into people every day who i gave\ncitations to uh 50 years ago and\nnobody likes it nobody likes to get a\ncitation of any type i mean i've talked\nto psychologists i've got a grandson\nthat's a psychiatrist and\nit's just inherent that\nyou know you don't like to be accused of\nsomething and when it's open for\ndiscussion like many of the things law\nenforcement officers do\nuh they tell me they weren't guilty but\ni gave them a ticket anyway and and uh\nour philosophy has always been if\nthere's any doubt\nlet them go\nuh\ngentlemen yield for another question\nsure\nyou've been\nyou've been thoroughly cross-examined\nfrom the legal perspective of what about\ncivil causes of action\nbut but i would um ask you have you have\nyou ever\nin your home on the property that you\nand your wife your wife occupy and that\nyour children your grandchildren call\nhome\nhas your\nsafety there\never been threatened because of your\npublic\nservice within this house and from your\npublic safety perspective i've been\nthreatened both\nand i think some of the people in\nleadership here know\ni had some uh anonymous phone calls last\nyear about my life with regard to bill\nthat was in our committee that\ndidn't come out and then uh several\ntimes during my career had people come\nto my house and uh\nsome of them had firearms and some of\nthem were slightly intoxicated and\nyou know it's not it's not an unusual\ncircumstance for law enforcement\nofficers to have that occur particularly\nif you work in the local area\nwhere you reside and they know who you\nare\none more question certainly\nmr chairman isn't it true\nand i use this catchphrase sometimes at\nhome\nthat um\nmy public safety\nmy first responders run to danger while\ni run away\ni think that's a very true statement in\nevery sense of the word\nbut mr chairman isn't it true\nthat these people that work put their\nlives on the line to protect us protect\nour safety every day\nthat they deserve the protections\nand the appreciation this body can offer\nto them but this legislation simply\noffers them protections\nto help prevent them from being harassed\nand intimidated as they do the jobs that\nthey signed up for\nand many times a very low risk return\nfor their investment in us\nprotecting we as individuals\nand acumen our communities as they're\nnot tremendous i think that's well\nstated and and to be honest uh\nuh during my tenure on the state patrol\nwe had 15 people killed in the line of\nduty i i knew every one of them\nthere were probably 40 or 50 more who\nwere shot or stabbed one was they tried\nto drown him in a ditch if a soldier\nhadn't come by and knocked him off\nprobably would have killed him\nuh it's a dangerous job you never know\nwhen it's going to occur\nand uh for the pay that they get it just\namazes me that and i think we're about\nto see uh\nsee a real decline in people who want to\nbe law enforcement officers uh you know\nall of us are very uh very aware of of\nuh social standing and what goes on in\nthe communities and what people think of\nyou and\nand certainly everybody enjoys a certain\namount of ego that\nthey like for the neighbors and their\nfriends to be appreciative of what they\ndo and when that stops i think we're\ngoing to have a real difficult time\nattracting qualified people and i've\nsaid many times\nand it not only occurs in law\nenforcement you get what you pay for and\nif you don't have high standards and pay\npeople\nsufficiently\nyou get what's left\nthank you for your service to this state\nand the people of it mr chairman thank\nyou thank you\ni'm going to abandon the will mr speaker\nand\ni uh\ni appreciate uh\neverybody who's sat here and listened to\nthis it's uh it's been a long\nlong endeavor for me but i\ni hope you'll see fit to uh to vote\nfor this bill as i think it\nis i think it's very positive for our\nlaw enforcement community as well as the\nfiremen and the others that many people\ndon't think about many times so\nthank you\nokay we have some other members i think\nhad parliamentary inquiries uh\nrepresentative jasmine clark did you\nwish to be recognized\nwhat purpose do you rise\nstate your inquiry is it not true that\nqualified immunity precludes individuals\nor makes it more difficult for\nindividuals to sue police officers but\nthat this bill would give the ability\nfor police officers to sue those people\nwell that gets into a long legal\ndiscussion i would refer you to\nthe leader of your caucus or to chairman\nfleming or chairman illustration and i\nthink they could probably\nshare a lot of\ninsight with you\nwhat purpose does representative\nwho's next i can't see with the mask\nderrick jackson representative jackson\nwhat purpose do you rise\nstate your inquiry\nmr speaker is it not true after two\ndecades of serving in the military that\ni support and defend\nall citizens to include first responders\npolice peace\nand fire department\ni believe that to be true\none more inquiry\nstate your inquiry is it not further\ntrue\nthat\nthis bill house bill 838\nis not solving\nthe problems that we are experiencing\ntoday with regards to\nsocial\ninjustice is that not for the truth\ni think that's something that will\naddress itself to each and every\nmember's\njudgment\nthank you for the inquiry\num\nrepresentative dreyer\nwhat purpose do you rise\nparliamentary state your inquiry\nlooking at lines um 69 through 72 of\nthis legislation is it not true that if\nan 18 year old happens to key a car of\nsomeone who is a first responder they\nwill the prosecutor can send them to\nprosecutors in jail for five years and\nthat the data shows us that prosecution\nis going to be\nharder on african-american\ncitizens of georgia than on white people\nand much more likely to get sent to jail\nfor a long time\nagain i think that's something that\naddresses itself to the\njudgment of each and every member\nwhat purpose does representative\nwolinsky rise\nhe waves off\nwhat purpose does representative abel\nmabel thomas rise\nthank you mr speaker\nis it not true\nthat in the current\nsocial unrest\nand\nwe are all in this together\nwhere we are trying to find a balance\nbetween\n[Music]\nnot just police brutality or police\nmisconduct\nbut systemic\nand structural racism in america\nthat this bill\nhas already been stated in terms of like\na double\nuh qualified immunity\nand it is very\num\npunitive\nand it will actually cause more\nharm\nthan good is that not true mr speaker\ni'm sure the lady believes that to be\ntrue\nall right thank you mr speaker what\npurpose does representative wilkerson\nrise\nis it not true i speak as not an\nattorney but as a father\na father who has seen his son interact\nwith police officers every day but had\nto have a 30-minute conversation with\nhim because of the social arrest we're\ndealing with\na father that is going to see a chamber\nwith not one african-american vote for\nthis bill and we are pitting\nlaw enforcement against our citizens\ni don't know what to say i love this\nchamber i love this body but i have\nnever been so disappointed in my life\nthank you mr speaker\nwhat purpose does um\nwhat purpose does representative reeves\nrise\nparliamentary inquiry state your inquiry\nmr speaker isn't it true that the vast\nmajority of crimes that are accounted\nfor in title 16 and other titles\nin our code section require just general\nintent\nbut that this bill with the inclusion in\nline 63 of the words maliciously\nand the term specific intent\nis created a much higher burden for the\nstate to prove intent and that from my\nexperience this higher burden will be\nthe difference in\nsome of the instances that have been\nbrought up such as\ngenerally keying a car\nwould separate those things from being\nwhat this bill is intended to cover with\nthe words malicious and specific intent\ni'm sure the gentleman believes that to\nbe true\nthat appears to be all of the\nparliamentary inquiries\nwe're going to be at ease for about for\na few minutes before we vote this bill\nso i'm going to ask you to\nstretch your legs take a restroom break\nif you need to\nstay close by we'll ring the bell but\nbefore\nthese individuals i have an unrelated\nmatter i need to see up at the

for a motion\nthank you mr speaker i move that the\nhouse agreed to the senate substitute to\nhouse bill 426\nchairman illustration has moved that\nthis house\nto the senate substitute to house bill\n426\nthe clerk will read the caption house\nbill 426 to be titled inactive men\narticle 1 chapter 10 is title 17 the\nofficial go to georgia annotated\nrelating the procedure for sentencing\nand imposition of punishment social\nadvice or criteria for imposition of\npunishment for crimes involving bias or\nprejudice\nthe chair recognizes chairman\nillustration\nto explain the senate substitute\nto house bill 426\nwell thank you mr speaker it's a\nwonderful day a historic day here in our\nstate capitol in the state of georgia as\nyou've heard me discuss before house\nbill 426\nis a momentous bill\nthat addresses a gap that we've had in\ngeorgia law since 2004. georgia is one\nof only four states without a hate\ncrimes law on the books\nand as i go through the language that's\nincorporated here in the senate bill i\nthink it's important to begin with the\nfact that\ngeorgia's existing law\nwas used as the framework for this bill\nthat the major issue\nwith the existing law was a lack of\nspecificity in the named protected\nclasses\nthat's something that this body did in\nmarch of 2019 when we passed house bill\n426 and sent it over to the senate\nthat bill has now come back and the only\naddition to the classes is the class of\nsex which you'll see here in the bill\nthat's one of the three changes that\ni'll point out for you\nthe second major change\nis in the applicability of the bill how\nthis works in the criminal court context\nso someone who is charged with a crime\nand that's important to note you must be\ncharged with an underlying criminal\noffense for this enhanced sentence to be\navailable\nthat person must first be convicted of\nthe underlying offense and the senate\nhas specified\nthat if it is a felony offense or one of\nfive misdemeanors\nthat there is an enhanced penalty\navailable which you'll see here in the\nlanguage in the statute\nnow\nthis is important because there are\ncertain crimes that are particularly\nheinous\nand simply looking at the criminal\noffense it doesn't reflect the true\nnature of the crime which is not just an\noffense against the victim\nbut it's it very well me may be an\noffense against a whole group of victims\nor an attack on all of society\nand recognition of that within our law\nis incredibly important\nhouse bill 426\nas amended does also include\na\nan additional provision in section 2.\nin section 2 there is a\ndata provision which was\nadded into the bill\nwhich would allow for the state to\ncollect necessary data in order to\nbetter determine\nthese of these types of offenses and the\nfrequency with which they occur they're\ninvestigated the disposition and such\nthe\nhouse bill that left this body and went\nover to the senate also had a enhanced\npenalty for a misdemeanor not a high and\naggravated misdemeanor and that is\nremoved from the senate version of the\nbill\nbut if i just summarize for you the\nthree changes it's number one\ndesignating five specific misdemeanors\nwhich will allow for enhanced penalties\nremoving the\nreduced\nmisdemeanor treatment for\none that isn't one of those fives adding\nsex to the protected classes and the\ndata component in section two\nnow this wouldn't have been possible\nwithout the great bipartisan cooperation\nthat we had here in this body the dean\nof the house\nwho i was incredibly proud to work with\nwho's my friend and who\nhas been with me throughout this we've\nbeen together throughout this process\nthe chair of the legislative black\ncaucus representative bennett\nthis incredible team that we've had\nalong with all of our co-sponsors\nbipartisan bipartisan co-sponsors to see\nthis measure through has made this\npossible today\nbut there's no doubt about it we would\nnot be here without\nour speaker of the house\na great leader and a great man\nwho's dedicated to justice\nand unity for the people of georgia so i\nwant to thank you mr speaker for this\n[Music]\n[Applause]\nas a speaker said this bill just passed\nthe state senate with an overwhelming\nsupport 47-6\nit's time for this house to do again\nwhat we did in march of 2019\nand this time to send an overwhelming\nvote a strong message that there's no\nplace for hate in georgia\ni urge your support of house bill 426\nthank you\nwhat purpose does representative vernon\njones arise\nparliamentary inquiries your inquiry mr\nspeaker isn't it true\nthat this piece of legislation does not\ninclude in its protective class\npeople who are assaulted\nas a result of a hate crime based on\ntheir party affiliation or their\npolitical ideology\nyou are absolutely correct it does not\ninclude that isn't it further true mr\nspeaker that people are actually being\nattacked\nbased on their party affiliation or\ntheir political ideology\nacross this country\nwell i'm not aware of people being\nattacked i know that we have of our\ndisagreements and debates from time to\ntime and and you know i think we've had\nthose for\nwell over two centuries now\nrepresentative\nisn't it true mr speaker that people\nhave been assaulted\nby wearing a political cap\nin this country physically assaulted\ni\ni have not seen anybody be physically\nassaulted but they could have been\nfinal parliamentary speech sure\nis there true mr speaker that i do have\nan amendment that will address people\nbeing attacked primarily because of\ntheir political persuasion affiliation\nor political ideology\nand that myself\ni've also received threats among other\nthings from people just based on my\nfreedom of expression\nwhich is one of our constitution which\nis a amendment to our constitution\nfreedom of expression\nthat if we don't address this now we're\ngoing to come back to this body when\nsomeone gets hurt\non the gentleman's motion at this house\nuh i'm sorry\nwhat purpose does representative holly\nrise\nfollow me aren't we state your inquiry\nit's not true mr speaker\nthat with the respect that i have from\nmy colleague who just spoke\nthat in light\nof the deaths of people who were not\nable to be here\nthat maybe this is not the time to\ncompare your tragedy because you are not\ntheir martyr is this true sir i'm sure\nthe gentleman believes that to be true\nthank you\non the gentleman's motion\nwhat purpose does rep chairman setzler\nrise\nparliamentary increments state your\ninquiry\nisn't it true that when we passed this\nbill\nlast session in march section two is not\na part of this bill mr speaker isn't\nthat true\nwhat is that\nthat is correct\nuh\nisn't it further true mr speaker that\nagain i appreciate your the deliberation\nwith which this body has taken things\nbut section two\njust to be clear\nit creates a circumstance\nwhere if it appears\nthat a defendant might have been\nselected for one of these\none of these\nalleged hate crimes\nit requires law enforcement to create a\nbiased crime report\nwhere\nif there is evidence it doesn't mean\nthat they're convicted doesn't say\nthere's a preponderance of the evidence\nbut if evidence exists this biased crime\nreport\nis logged and is maintained\nin fact the only thing that requires\nthis to happen even if law enforcement\ndoes not see it happen isn't it true\nthat\nany offense that's counted\nan offense shall be counted for each\nincident reported to the police so that\nunder this bill this is not what we\npassed before this bill says that any\nincident reported to their police shall\nbe a separate incident\nof a biased crime report this is not\nisn't it true mr speaker debated in\ncommittee in this chamber this was added\non by the senate and the posture to take\nthat out and to pass the clean hate\ncrimes bill we contemplated earlier is\nto vote no on this\nand vote on a version that that's more\nconsistent with what the house passed\nbefore\nwell you know this is a a process mr\nchairman it's a process that involves a\nlittle compromise\nand\n[Music]\ni've seen very few measures go through\nhere that were not the result of\ncompromise because everybody brings\ndifferent ideas to the table\nwhat purpose does representative\ngertler rise\nmomentary and cory state your inquiry is\nnot true\nthat we should not be lowering and\nhiring the standard of justice based on\nimmutable factors such as race ethnicity\nand gender\nif the gentleman believes that i'm sure\nhe thinks it's accurate\nwhat purpose does representative frazier\nrise state your inquiry mr speaker isn't\nit true that\nahmad aubrey's mother miss wonder cooper\njones is watching this session live as\nwe speak and she supports house bill 426\nand i hope that she is watching it\nrepresentative\nokay\non the gentleman's
