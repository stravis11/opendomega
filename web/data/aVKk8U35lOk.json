Carries on a long\ntradition of service from his family,\nRepresentative Howard.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker.\nColleagues,\nuh it's my distinct honor and privilege\nuh to introduce today's devotional\nspeaker, Pastor Claude Harris, Jr.\nUh I I don't know uh Pastor Harris just\nin passing. I've known him and his\nparents most of my life. As a matter of\nfact, his father who's with us today uh\nactually is one of my mentors in\nministry. I've watched uh Claude Jr. I\nwatched him grow in his faith. I've\nwatched him grow in his character and of\ncourse now even in his calling.\nHe was raised in a home that was ground\nas grounded in ministry uh as the son of\nnow overseer Claude Harris senior and\npastor Regina Harris and from an early\nage uh it was evident just watching him\ngrow up that God's hand was on his life\nbefore stepping into pastoral leadership\nat the New Life worship center uh in\nSeptember 2024. Claude built a prolific\nmusic career. He is a stellar award\nnominated artist whose songwriting and\nproduction credits include work with\nnotable artist gospel artists like PJ\nMortyn and Jonathan Nelson. Uh he's the\noverseer once again as pastor over he's\nthe senior pastor at the New Life\nWorship Center in Hebs, Georgia. But\nwhat I appreciate about this young man\nmore than anything else is that he\nrepresents the next generation of\nleadership, but it's rooted in truth. Uh\nhe's respectful of legacy and committed\nto service. And today he joins us not as\na musical artist but as a servant of\nGod. Uh here to center our hearts and\nour minds as we carry out the work for\nthe people of Georgia. Please join me in\nwelcoming Pastor Claude Harris Jr.\ndevotional speaker for today.\nGood morning,\nMr. Speaker, and members of the House.\nIt's an honor to stand before you today,\nand I thank Representative Carlton\nHoward for this opportunity this\nmorning. I stand not as one proclaiming\nexpertise in politics, but as one who\nrecognizes and deeply respects the\ncalling of servant leadership at rest\nupon each of you. Scripture reminds us\nof a truth that is both simple and\nprofound. Whoever wants to be great\namong you must be your servant. And\nwhoever wants to be first must be your\nservant. Just as the son of man did not\ncome to be served, but to serve. That's\nfound in Matthew 20 26- 28. In your work\nhere at the Georgia State Capital,\nyou're entrusted with the weighty\nresponsibility of shaping laws and\npolicies that affect millions of lives.\nFamilies, children, seniors, neighbors,\nall seeking hope and provision. At\ntimes, the burdens are heavy. Decisions\nare hard, pressures are real, and the\nvoices of many compete for attention.\nAnd yet leadership at its best is not\nabout power, position, or pride. It's\nabout service.\nJesus tells us that true leadership is\nmeasured not by what we gain, but by\nwhat we give,\nnot by who we elevate,\nbut by how we lift others.\nHis model is one of humility,\ncompassion, and sacrificial love. As\nservant leaders, your work matters.\nYour service is not in vain. The hope of\nGeorgia is not merely in laws passed\nhere, but in the hearts that lead with\nwisdom,\njustice, and mercy. So today, I want to\nencourage each of you with this thought.\nLead not for acclaim,\nbut for the good of those you serve.\nLead not for applause,\nbut for the flourishing of your\nneighbors.\nLead not with pride, but with humility\nand grace.\nMay your decisions reflect wisdom.\nMay your words build bridges where there\nis division.\nand may your service honor the dignity\nof every Georgian.\nCould you please stand and let us pray.\nGracious and sovereign God, we thank you\nfor this day and for the privilege of\ngathering in this historic chamber. We\nthank you for the men and women of the\nGeorgia House of Representatives, for\nthe calling you've placed on their lives\nto serve the people of this state. We\nask today that you would fill them with\nwisdom beyond their own understanding,\ncourage to do what is right, compassion\nfor those who are affected by their\ndecisions. Guide their hearts toward\njustice, their minds toward clarity, and\ntheir conversations toward unity. In\nmoments of stress, grant peace.\nIn moments of disagreement, grant\nhumility.\nIn moments of success, grant gratitude.\nMay they never forget that they are\ncalled to serve first and that service\nrooted in love, truth, and righteousness\nstrengthens the foundation of this great\nstate. Bless this house, their families,\nand every citizen of Georgia. We pray\nthis in your holy name. Amen.\n>> Amen.\n>> Now, let's join in for the pledge.\nI pledge allegiance to the flag of the\nUnited States of America and to the\nrepublic for which it stands, one\nnation,\nindivisible, with liberty and justice\nfor all.\n>> Awesome.\nmembers. I know we can all take those\nwords to heart and our service here, but\nI want to make sure that we um\nacknowledge someone who's here too, and\nthat's um\nElder Claude Harris, Senior, who's\nresponsible for these two young men up\non stage.

The\nhallmarks of doula support emphasize\ncommunity-based interpersonal\nrelationships, health promotion through\npreventive care, child birth and health\neducation, emotional support, and the\nimprovement of health outcomes. The\nstate of Georgia has a rich history of\nmothers, grandmothers, aunts, sisters,\nand other close individuals who attend\nbirths as supportive figures. And\nresearch shows that even without formal\ntraining, this support can significantly\ndecrease the likelihood of cescareian\nsections, shorten labor times, and\nimprove the birthing experience.

This resolution have\nbeen signed to the committee on natural\nresources and environment. That\ncommittee recommends that this\nresolution\nbe adopted.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Clerk. Chair Lady Lynn\nSmith is recognized to present the\nresolution. Lady will pause just for a\nmoment.\n>> Ladies recognized.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning,\nmembers of the House. Um, it's my honor\ntoday to present to you House Resolution\n10008.\nThis is a long journey of the state of\nGeorgia taking a very important role its\ncitizens in the health of the state of\nGeorgia in the areas of natural resource\nin particular. This is your issue\nconcerning water management. Several\nyears ago when I was first elected I\ncame to the cap and was very clear about\nexpressing my concerns about water\nissues in and around my area. We were\nsouth of Atlanta. Atlanta was cavalerely\npolluting its rivers. U where I lived.\nYou could not go to the river. You the\nsmell was awful. Um and so I'd been\nformer chair of um the chamber of\ncommerce and we could not promote that\npart of our of our county. So my tagline\nwas um I don't need to take you to the\nChattahuchi and show it to you. Just\ntake a deep breath. You can smell it.\nSo, it was good to help get me elected,\nbut when I got up here and tried it,\n179 of you looked at me and thought,\nwell, we got our problems, too. So, um,\nmy journey was to learn that if I was to\nbe effective, I had to know and learn\nthe areas and the concerns of of the\nrest of you and the rest of the state of\nGeorgia. Georgia was also under this\nheavy anvil. We were involved in tri\nstraight water wars. Uh we were being\nsued by Florida and Alabama. And then\nall of a sudden nature started taking\nover and we were struggling with\ndroughts and different things. But we\ndid not work nor act as a state dealing\nwith our issues. So began the long\njourney. And what I'm going to present\nto you today is the result of part of\nthe process. If you'll look up at the\nboards, you'll see a a map of the water\nplanning districts for the state of\nGeorgia. There is a carve out and this\nbill does not pertain to the\nmetropolitan Georgia metropolitan\nAtlanta area. They they had as a body we\nwe determined that they needed to be\ntheir own group because they could work\nunder the ark of the ARC, Atlanta\nRegional Commissioner. And so they in\nthe beginning we passed a statute that\nsaid you need to get organized and deal\nwith your problems. But we knew the rest\nof the state need to do that as well.\nAnd so began the study on how to create\nregional\n>> the if the lady will suspend just for a\nmoment.\n>> Y'all know about water. It's pretty\nimportant. This is an important bill, a\nresolution. So, let's give the lady your\nattention. If you have a conversation\nthat needs to take place, take it to the\neither Annie room, please.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the\nHouse, I knew I might put you to sleep,\nbut I didn't mean to do it that early.\nSo,\nso back to the story of why we're doing\nthis today because I think it's\nimportant. Most of y'all in this room,\nsome of you were not born in 1997. Hate\nto say that, but it's true. So, you\ndon't know our water history.\nState of Georgia was underwater with all\nof our problems. We were not stepping\nup. We were not taking action. The city\nof Atlanta, the greater metro area had\nto\nbe\nencouraged by legislation to start\ndealing with your problems. But then the\nrest of state had its problems as well.\nAnd along this process, we as a state\nare now the example for the United\nStates, all the other states. But it's\nbeen a long journey. And one of the\nthings we have to do now with House\nResolution 10008\nis review the actions of all these\nregions outside of the metropolitan\nAtlanta area. Some are performing very\nwell, some not so well. And um that is\nthe charge we gave to the state water\nmanagement planning group and they met\nin uh December and looked at the\ndifferent and varying issues\nand one of the areas that was identified\nis that the water council meets every\nfive years to review these regional\nwater plans. the appointments were made\nevery three years\nand so in some areas of the state people\nwere actively engaged in other areas\nthey weren't. We required them to have x\nnumber of people on the boards but they\ncouldn't get a quorum. In other words,\nwe created something was not efficient\nand not effective. And so the state\nwater planning group met that met in\nDecember and um they came up with um\nsome suggestions and there's there's of\ncourse the legal language which is in\nhouse resolution 10008\nand um they in the resolution it simply\nsays they're amending a particular code\nsection of this area. So, what I'd like\nto do right now is explain to you what\nthat code section is actually saying.\nBut you keep in mind and what I told you\nearlier, some of the areas of our state\nare not functioning because they can't\nget a quorum because it takes too many\npeople. The other thing that's going on\nright now is we've been asleep for a few\nyears because we've not had tragic\nevents until Hurricane Helen. And then\nwe woke up and realized, woo, we we need\nto be a little bit more efficient and\nand proactive as opposed to um reactive.\nAnd so the we were given this well, it\nwas put in the form of a resolution. The\namendment includes reduce reduce reduce\nthe number of governor appointments from\n13 to 7. Reduce the number of lieutenant\ngovernor appointments from six to three.\nReduce the number of speaker of the\nhouse appointments from six to three.\nRemove the alternate council members.\nIncrease the length of appointments from\nthree years to six years. I'll say that\nagain. Increase the length of\nappointments for three years to six\nyears. Now we're doing it every three\nyears. And so require each council to\nhave at least one representative from\neach of the water and wastewater demand\nforecast sectors, municipal, industrial,\nagricultural, energy. Why are they\nspecifically named? Because they are the\nconsumers of our natural resources. And\nso yes, they need to have a presence\nthere.\nthe update. It updates the requirements\nfrom the memorandum of understanding\nbetween EPD and Department of Community\nAffairs. Essentially what we're doing\nhere,\nthis these amendments do not include\nchange to the exeicial membership and\nI'm an exeicial member, one of the\nmembers on this side. Under the state\nborder plan, the lieutenant governor and\nspeaker of the house each appoint a non-\nvoting exopicial member from the\nmembership of the state and house\nsenate. State and house if you're um\nand then to go further if and I'm\nanticipating what some of the questions\nmight be, but I need to point out this\nis not an exclusive group. this is your\ngroup wherever you live and and yes, you\nhave a role to play. If you want to be\none of the appointments to the board,\nthen you need to let the chair know. And\nI'm going to give you a website that you\ncan go to to say, I'm I'm interested in\nthis. As with most people,\nit's not an issue in front of us right\nnow. But forecasting and moving forward,\nthings are going to change a little bit.\nYou can't predict the climate. We can\npass all the laws we want. We can't tell\nthe climate what to do. But our pattern\nis excessive rain. It's also going to\nhave a reverse pattern of more droughts.\nAnd we need every region of the state of\nGeorgia to be effective and responsive.\nIf you're not on the council, but you\nwant to be involved, let them know. A\nlot of the councils have working groups\nwhere they get together and make things\nwork. And in the end, you need to know\nthis was a difficult difficult thing for\nyour colleagues to do through the years\nof the late 19 on 2000 2010 and on.\nIt was a lot of criticism. Your farmers\nin particular were were singled out to\num be better stewards of of the use of\nthe water. So, so we as a state are\nleading the state, the United States,\nbut to stay in that role and to look\nafter our citizens, we I ask your\nfavorable consideration of House\nResolution8.\nMr. Speaker, open to questions.\n>> Yes, you have a question to your right.\nChairman Dicki is recognized for a\nquestion. Um, does lady yield?\n>> Yes.\n>> Thank you, Madam Chair, for bringing\nthis very important legislation and your\nwork um ensuring Georgia has adequate\nwater resources. And I just want to\nreiterate to this chamber how important\nthese water councils have been and\ncontinue to be in in allocating and\nplanning for future growth for our state\nwith our water, whether it's\nagricultural,\nindustrial, um municipal, whatever uh\nhow are we using our water? These\ncouncils are um such an uh important\npart of the uh going forward. So, thank\nyou for this legis legislation.\nThank you.\n>> Lady, yield for a couple more.\n>> Yes, Mr. Speaker.\n>> Represent Representative Thomas to your\nright is recognized for a question.\n>> Do you yield?\n>> Yes.\n>> Is it not true that we worked together\nin this off season and traveled all\nacross the state studying water issues\nand impacts from uh economic\ndevelopment. And one of the things the\ncommittee found is the work that you've\ndone even 20 years ago was incredibly uh\nhad an incredible amount of foresight\nand uh that the findings were that\nreally we're in a great place in the\nstate of Georgia thanks to you and the\nthe foresight of the general assembly 20\nplus years ago.\n>> Thank you.\n>> Yeah. And thank you for bringing this\nbill. This is a great piece of\nlegislation.\n>> Thank you. If I may interject, thank you\nuh\nrepresentative for chairing our resource\nmanagement committee and and gathering\ninformation as well. Y'all that\ncommittee and you and you've done a\ngreat job of bringing information.\nRepresentative Sanchez is recognized for\na question to your right.\n>> Thank you, speaker. Does the general\nlady yield?\n>> Yes.\n>> They just had a quick question. Uh the\nterms are changing from three to six\nyears. So does that mean that they're\nall when the current terms expire they\nbecome six years or are they resetting\nthis year?\n>> So that's a good question. The next time\nthe council meets for these is 2020\n28. So what we're doing is laying the\ngroundwork for from that point forward\nto have it work smoothly.\n>> Thank you.\n>> Representative Ellen Powell to your\nright by the doors is recognized for a\nquestion. Chairman Powell. Thank you.\nWill lady Will the lady yield? Yes.\n>> Is it not true? I don't have a problem\nwith your resolution, but I want to I\nhave a point of inquiry to make. I'm\nlooking down this list and it's got uh\nunder my house district and the the\nMetropolitan North Georgia water\ndistrict, but yet we're solidly in the\nSavannah River District. And I want to\nbe sure that that this is just an error\non here and not what was in the plan.\nbecause while I certainly respect my\nfriends in the North Metro Water\nDistrict, don't throw me in the brier\npatch with them.\n>> Thank you. And I'm sure that is already\nbeing looked at and you will get the\nanswer you need.\n>> But you would feel you would feel\ncertain it's not true that we would be\nin the Savannah River district, not the\n>> I can't speak specifically to that. I\ncan\nif you know you're I know I'm in the\nmiddle Chattanooi district and they\nshowed me a little bit in the Atlanta\narea. So um um that would have to be\nverified by EPD director and they're not\npresent here.\nI will do this though to help all of you\nwho might have a question similar to\nthat. Here is the EPD's website on\nwater. It's waterplanning.jorg.gov.\nwaterplanning.jorg.gov.\nI know I'm in the middle Chattahuchi\ndistrict ab budding Atlanta. So you\nmight be looking at um actual areas that\nare reflecting a basin as opposed to a\nregion. I think that's what's going on\nthere.\nLady has one more question.\nRepresentative Holly to your left is\nrecognized for a question.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentle\nlady yield?\n>> Yes.\n>> Um, is it not true that for certainly um\nnot only for the conservation of water\nare these districts are important, but\nalso just for supporting the local uh\nland and water usage plans for the local\ncounties? because many times um these\nwaters and lakes actually have a lot of\nbiodiversity um that is going back to\neven the Paleozoic periods. And so it's\ngood for just to be able to maintain uh\nuh good documentation for those\nmicroorganisms that um are are helping\nto actually help uh make sure that the\nwater in the area remains as it is.\n>> Thank you. And I suggest you\ncontact EPD and say you'd be interested\nin helping on one of the councils. This\nis a living document is what I'm asking\nyou to do. It is a responsive document.\nIf we run into a problem or a concern,\nit can be revisited every year. So that\nis what makes it so good. Sometimes it's\nnot easy to make our changes. I've had\nsome been called awful things through\nthe years, but Georgia, the state of\nGeorgia, is the national leader because\nwe have stepped forward. And even with\ntoday, I had no way of anticipating the\nquestions or the debates, but um we're\ndoing it y'all and we're leading the\nnation. So, thank you, Mr. Speaker. I\nlead yield.\n>> We have no further questions. The lady\nhas yielded well. Thank you for your\nwork in so many areas of natural\nresources and conversa conservation and\nespecially on water. Is any objection to\nthe previous question being ordered?\nHearing none, the previous question is\nordered. Is there any objection to\nagreeing to the report of the committee\nwhich was favorable to the adoption of\nthe resolution? Hearing none, the report\nof the committee is agreed to. Shall\nthis resolution now be adopted? All in\nfavor of the adoption of the resolution\nwill vote yes. All those opposed will\nvote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock\nthe machine?\nHave all members now voted?\nAll members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk,\nwill you lock the machine? On the\nadoption of the resolution, the yays are\n168, the naysay are zero. The resolution\nhaving received the requisite\nconstitutional majority is therefore\nadopted. Thank you members.\nThat completes our rules calendar. We'll\nmove on. We have a number of afternoon\norders.\nIn fact, we have a whole slew of\nafternoon orders.\nI'm going to ask the members to do your\nbest to hold it down to about a minute\nto a minute and a half. There's a couple\nof you have requested a little bit more\ntime and you will have a maximum of two\nminutes. There's a couple of you there.\nSo, we'll um we'll get through our\nafternoon orders. Um we'll recognize\nfor the first afternoon order,\nRepresentative Beckals and\nRepresentative Ford. Few\nladies are recognized for an afternoon\norder.\nThen we'll have Representative Stacy\nEvans and Reps will be on deck.\nRepresentative Beckles and\nRepresentative Ford.\n>> Thank you, Speaker. Members, today we\npause to honor the life and legacy of\nAapahol Mayor Wayman Smith. I'm proud to\ncall Mayor\n>> Right. Excuse me. Ladies, suspend.\nLadies and gentlemen, if you'll stand\nwith me, please.\n>> I'm proud to call Mayor Smith my friend\nand my supporter. Since he was the mayor\nof my hometown, he was the one of the\nfirst endorsements I sought to when I\ndecided to run for this seat. He and I\nhave worked together on various projects\nin the past for our little town. But I\nwill mostly remember our work together\npost hurricane Helen along with others\nin comm in our community during those 10\ndays where when we were without power\nfeeding people, supplying ice, water,\ntarps, and other resources just to get\nthem through this difficult time. He was\nalways present, committed to serving his\ncommunity, never seeking notoriety.\nMayor Smith was a true servant leader,\nconstantly dedicated to serving the\npeople, all people. I'm forever forever\ngrateful for his leadership and for his\nservice to the town of Arapahal. My\nheart goes out to our citizens and his\nfamily as his absence will be felt for\nyears to come.\nOn behalf of this body, we extend our\ndeepest condolences to the Smith family,\nthe entire South Georgia community who\nloved and supported Mir Smith. We thank\nyou for sharing him with us. May God's\nfavor, comfort, and peace rest upon his\nfamily and all who mourn. Though his\nearthly work is complete, his impact\nremains. May he rest in eternal peace.\nCan we please have a moment of silence?\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker.\n>> We appreciate the mayor's service. I\nthink that's one of the coolest names of\nany town in Georgia, Lapahal. It's\npretty cool.\nGreat work. Thank you, ladies. And our\ncondolences to the family.\nRepresentative Evans and Representative\nGains recognized for an afternoon order.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And if members\nof the Athens delegation are here and\nwant to join us, I invite them up.\nLadies and gentlemen, I just wanted to\ngive you an update. Sometimes we don't\nhear about the the good things that are\nhappening because of legislation that we\npassed in 2023. This body passed the\nColeman Baker Act, which Representative\nGaines uh spearheaded and several others\nin here helped. And that bill created a\ncold case unit within the GBI where\nfamilies who had um lingering murder\ncases that were still open after three\nyears could ask for those to be reopened\nand for law enforcement to take a second\nlook. And a law school class made of\nmine in the year 2001, Tara Baker was\nmurdered during our first year of law\nschool. And because of the Coleman Baker\nAct, um a suspect was arrested um about\ntwo summers ago and he is standing trial\nthis week. Jury selection is going on\nright now. That trial will probably last\n3 to six weeks. Um but that trial could\nnot happen and this family could not be\nlooking at u potential closure without\nthis body's work. And I just wanted to\nlet y'all know about that update and say\nthank you.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker.\n>> Thank you. Representative\nAli.\nRepresentative Ali.\nA gentleman through right there, please.\nThank you, Representative. Gentleman's\nrecognized.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker.\nI wanted to introduce a child as\navailable for adoption as has become\ntradition. On the screen is a\n16-year-old named Orenthion. Orinthian\nis extremely polite, kind-hearted, and a\nBraves fan. And so if you or anyone in\nyour community is looking for a new\nfamily member or to show somebody what\nfamily looks like, as always, the\nwebsite is it's my turn now.\nDHS.jorg.gov.\nThank you so much.\n>> Thank you. Thank you. Good work.\nChairman Jaspers,\nChairman of Transportation,\n>> chair. Now, ladies and gentlemen,\nmembers, you need to pay attention to\nthis probably an issue that will impact\nyou either this year or in the near\nfuture, Mr. Chairman.\n>> Yeah. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And it\nthis will if you look on your desk, we\nput the rules to name a road,\nintersection, roundabout, part of a\nhighway, all sorts of things.\nthat are state highway.\nNow, if you look over here over by the\ndoor, you'll see our new policy analyst,\nDanny Nichols, way, way bigger.\nShe wrote it. She helps you with it. You\nneed to get to know her if you do this.\nBut I got a couple of things. You know,\nWhit Park brought it up the other day\nthat were new members and might need to\nreview a few of these things. And thank\nyou for encouraging us to do that. A\ncouple of things. Read the rules.\nI mean, you know, we'll have to come\nback and tell you that no, you can't do\nthat. And I'm not afraid to tell you no.\nBut also\ncheck the background of the person that\nyou might be uh interested in naming a\nroad, intersection, or something after\ncuz we do. we kind of look and you know\nthere's nothing more embarrassing than\nhaving that happen to you and we'd have\nto tell you no. You know you can also\nask myself, Vice Chairman McDonald, you\nknow, Secretary Mcllum,\nMr. Prince over here to um can help you\nwith those. We look forward to helping\nyou and serving you. It's a it's a real\nIf you haven't done it, you need to name\na road after somebody important in your\ncommunity. And I look forward to helping\nour new member, Mr. venture uh name a\nroad intersection after Mandy Ballinger\nsoon. Thank you, Bill. Thank you, Mr.\nSpeaker.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nOkay, members, check the rules because\nthat's an important\nimportant opportunity to honor someone\nin your district that's made a\ndifference. Representative Draper\nrecognized for an afternoon order.\nand friends.\nGive the lady in the will your\nattention, please. Representative Draper\nis recognized.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker.\nUh, so by now you all know that\nyesterday the Trump DOJ and FBI\nconducted a raid on the Folton County\nElections Hub. They took hundreds of\nboxes of documents that contain\nsensitive information about Georgia\nvoters and the original ballots from the\n2020 elections. Those documents right\nnow are on trucks. They are being taken\nout of the state of Georgia. They are\ngoing to Virginia. Do not talk to me\nabout chain of custody or ballot\nsecurity if you are not up in arms about\nthis. I don't have very much time up\nhere, so I'm going to get right to the\npoint. This is a full-on attack on\ndemocracy. This kind of federal\ninterference with the state election\nfunction is completely unprecedented.\nThe Trump administration has been trying\nto get this information on Fulton voters\nthrough civil lawsuits. They have been\ntrying to get this information through\ntheir pitbulls on the SEB and they have\nbeen trying to get this information\nthrough their lackey on the Fulton\nCounty Board of Elections. They kept\nlosing. So, they are bypassing the civil\njustice system uh with this highly\nquestionable and likely statute of\nlimitation barred criminal\ninvestigation. Y'all, it is 2026.\nIt has been more than 5 years since\nTrump lost Georgia, a fact that has been\nverified time and time again. And let me\nspeak directly to the voters of Georgia\nwho need to understand the significance\nof this moment. Yesterday's raid on\nFulton County is not about the 2020\nelection. It was never about the 2020\nelection. This is all about the 2026\nelection and beyond. Let me tell you how\nthis is going to work. Once they start\ninvestigating Fulton County, they will\nsay they found something suspicious. It\ndoesn't have to be real. It just needs\nto offer a pretextual justification for\nwhat will happen next. And what happens\nnext is going to depend on the backbone\nand integrity of the people in this room\nand rooms like this one. Will this body\n>> her time? She will need to finish up.\nYou got about 10 seconds.\n>> Will this bad body pass a slate of bills\nthat makes voting harder? Will we take\nover the Fulton County Board of\nElections? Because I think that's what\nthe Trump administration wants. They\nwant to take over Fulton County, which\nis not just the largest county in\nGeorgia, it is the home to Atlanta.\nBecause if they can take over bright\nblue Fulton County, they don't have to\nput forward good candidates. They don't\nhave to compete in the\n>> suspend. She is her time. Be respectful\nto the other members that need to have\nan afternoon order.\n>> Thank you very much.\n>> We encourage you to do the right thing.\nChairman Anderson is recognized for an\nafternoon order.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I'm\nnot an attorney. I'm not an officer of\nthe court.\nI'm not accustomed to, nor do I pretend\nto practice the theatrics that may be\ninvolved with that. We talk about the\nevents yesterday that happened in Fulton\nCounty.\nAnd let me say this first. I have faith\nin our justice system. I have faith in\nthe process that we put together and put\nin place in this nation and in this\nstate to make sure that judicial matters\nare handled in the proper way. What did\nwe see yesterday? It's being\ncharacterized as a raid. It's being\nsensationalized in the media. It's being\nsensationalized here in this room. What\nwe saw yesterday was the lawful\nexecution of a lawfully obtained federal\nsearch warrant that was signed by a US\nmagistrate court judge.\nThat's part of the process.\nI think back to the last week or two and\nlook at some of the court cases that\nhave have been resolved or at least to\nsome extent resolved in the state of\nGeorgia. There was one resolved last\nweek where the Department of Justice had\nsued Georgia related to some of the\nprovisions of Senate Bill 202, our\nelection integrity bill. One of those\nwas the state's authority and ability to\ntake over a county election board.\nThe 11th Circuit Court of Appeals\ndismissed that case on constitutional\ngrounds. The case was brought on\nconstitutional grounds. Their dismissal\nwas for other reasons, but they said\nthat that that provision of our law that\nthis body voted on that was signed into\nlaw in Georgia was upheld.\nNow, I would be remiss if I didn't talk\nabout another case that just earlier\nthis week was dismissed and that was\nanother Department of Justice case suing\nthe Secretary of State asking for,\nexcuse me, asking for unredacted voter\nfiles in Georgia. That case was\ndismissed not on the grounds but it was\ndis dismissed on the venue.\n>> Gentleman will suspend. You have about\n10 seconds to complete your remarks.\n>> I don't really need it. Thank you, Mr.\nSpeaker.\n>> Good decision.\nRepresentative Gistler,\nthere you are. I was looking for you\ndown. It's recognized for an order.\nRepresentative.\n>> Yes. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Uh, this is\nmy first time speaking from the well, so\nI want to say very quickly, uh, thank\nyou to the body for the warm\n>> first time. You take as long as you\nwant, right?\n>> Is that right?\n>> I'm kidding. No, I'm kidding. Was\nreckoning.\n>> All right. I I'll make this very quick.\nUm, I I'm rising today. I'm asking for\nsupport for what I think should be a\nnonpartisan resolution. Uh, although it\nmay not come out that way. Um, it's\nsimply asking this body to reaffirm that\num that current Georgia law prohibits\nthe Secretary of State from sending\nprivate voter data to the Department of\nJustice. Uh, that's it. That's what I'm\nasking for. Um, I would appreciate any\nsupport from both sides of the aisle.\nUh, come find me if you'd like to learn\nmore about it. Thank you.\n>> Thank you, Representative. Good job.\nRepresentative Glaze\nrecognized for an afternoon order.\nRepresent Glaze.\nladies recognized.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker.\nPro Tim Jones, members of this august\nbody. I rarely come to stand before you\nto talk about something that is so\nburdensome on my heart that relates to\nthe district I live in and the district\nI serve.\nBut last night I watched something that\nnone of us should ignore.\n318 Willers rolled out of the Fulton\nCounty elections headquarters\nfilled with voter ballots and related\nelection materials\nseized as a part of the FBI criminal\ninvestigation into the 2020 elections.\nThat image should give every Georgian\npause\nregardless of party ideology or who you\nvoted for. Let us be clear about the\nfacts. The 2020 election in Georgia was\nsubjected to multiple recounts. county\nofficials, the Secretary of State.\nBrad Brad Rothberger,\nas well as ultimately our Governor Brian\nKemp, certifying these results. This\nprocess was completed. The election was\nsettled. And yet today, questions have\nbeen asserted, serious ones. Who is safe\nis my question from retribution in a\ndemocracy.\nWho, if anyone could face criminal\ncharges? And most importantly, who does\naccountability truly look at and who in\nthis system will hold and build out and\nkeep the rule of law in America?\nInvestigations are not convictions.\nDue process matters. Presumption of\ninnocence matters. No one should be\njudged in the court of public opinion.\nAnd no one in office or agency or an\nindividual is above the law. Georgians\ndeserve transparency, not theater.\nFacts, not fear, justice, not vengeance.\nI yield the well.\nChairman Prince is recognized for an\nafternoon order.\nChairman Prince. Uh thank you, Mr.\nSpeaker, and good afternoon, colleagues.\nListen, on your desk, I put a book out\nthere, uh the sacred waters of the Oki\nFinoi. Uh if you have a good coffee\ntable, you don't have a coffee table,\nmaybe a bar, just some good reading and\nsome good pictures for you to look at\nand just to reflect uh just how good God\nis. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.\n>> Thank you, Representative.\nHere's our posture to the uh minority\nleader and and your and your whip your\nand to the majority leader and your\nwhip. We we'll would like love to meet\nwith you all you all on Monday before\nsession begins. Uh this is a privilege\nthat we all enjoy here of speaking our\nminds. But there are rules of our speech\nthat are in our rules rule books for\nthis house and we intend to comply with\nthose rules as long as members keep\ntheir speech in the proper context and I\nthink we all need to be aware of the\nrules.
