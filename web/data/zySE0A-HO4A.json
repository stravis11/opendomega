  "transcript": "Anybody in the hall coming in, come on in.\nAll right boys quiet. I guess we'll go ahead and get started. People will start coming\non here. That way, that way you might not get as many questions, Commissioner. Come on\nup, Commissioner Raven. I'm glad that y'all could come on early and help us move on a\nlittle quicker. And we look forward to hearing what the Department of Natural Resources\nneeds. Lord, ears. Good afternoon and thank you for having me here today. Look forward\nto discuss in our amended FY26 budget along with our FY27 budget for the Department of\nNatural Resources. Let me begin before I get into my talking points to say how thankful\nwe are to Governor Kemp and Director Dunn for their continued support of the DNR mission\nand our employees. And I look forward to working with all of you in the general assembly\nand hope you can also be supportive of these efforts.\nBefore we get into the actual DNR budget,\nI did want to give you a brief update on several items\nthat you funded last year and last year's budget.\nI hear from many of you throughout the year\nand everyone knows that Farrell Hoggs\ncontinued to be a hot topic throughout the state.\nThanks to this body and the governor.\nlast year we created a new awards program that was funded and is being\nadministered by our Wildlife Resources Division. The name of this new program is\ncalled the Hog Down Awards Program and what we have done is incentivized the\nkilling of feral hogs. We have a contest and we award five\nfive traps, Farrell Hogg, Sounder traps, each quarter.\nSo thus far, we have awarded 10 traps to date\nand those applicants that have put in for those traps\nhave killed more than 4,000 hogs across the landscape\nof Georgia, which is a very good thing.\nAnd then along with this incentivized program\nand the Farrell Hogg task force, we have removed\nover 12,000 hogs from Georgia's landscape, which I hope that many of you will hear positive\ncomments from the ag community in your areas.\nAdditionally, I wanted to thank you for your continued support for the Hunters for the\nHungary program.\nWe are greatly appreciative of that.\nThis program has grown significantly with the funding that you have provided.\nWe now have 56 processors across the state that are participating, which covers about 52 counties.\n99 food banks across our state have received that donated venison that our hunters have\nharvested, which accounts for about 106,000 pounds of venison.\nWe are working towards our goal for the year of 140,000 pounds of venison for these food\nbanks. We hope to achieve that goal through the extended\nbow season that is still going on in our Metro counties and\ndown in Southwest Georgia, but also through our crop\ndepredation damage permits. And while I'm on crop damage\npermits, we can send you to receive and I will make sure\nyou hear me correctly. Great feedback with our program and\nwhat we have done working with you here in your comments\nand implementing those into how we issue crop damage permits.\nOver the past year, we've issued over 900 crop damage permits\nwhere we have authorized the killing of up to 31,000 deer\noutside of our regulated deer season.\nSo we hear you, we hear your constituents\nand are committed to continue to work toward that problem\nwhile maintaining a healthy deer herd for our hunters.\nNow moving on to the budget, what we're here to hear about.\nDNR has several items in the Governor's Budget Report\nfor AFY26, and that begins on page 259.\nWe are very, very thankful for the $2,000 supplement\nin the amended budget, which recognizes the importance\nof recruitment and retention for the men and women\nof the Department of Natural Resources\nand are very appreciative of those dollars\nthat'll go toward that.\nAnd you'll see that supplement reflected\nin every one of our division's budgets.\nUnder coastal resources, item two,\nis there is a $500,000 request to replace\nour coastal resources database, which is over 20 years old.\nthis will help to streamline the permitting and application process all along the coast.\nIf you'll look on page 260 under parks recreation and historic sites,\nitem 2 is $1.25 million for erosion control at Cricket River State Park in Camden County.\nIf you ever visit the park, you'll see the enormous amount of erosion that has taken place\nthere since the 1960s. We've actually had to move our 11 cabins three different times\nbecause the erosion continues to increase in crotch. So this request is to be used for the\nstate match for a $5 million grant that we have applied for to address that erosion problem.\nItem 3 provides $500,000 in pass-through funding to the Stone Mount Memorial Association\nfor financial and operational review and planning.\nOn that same page under Wildlife Resources Item 2 provides $5 million for road paving\nproject on Saplow Island.\nItem 3 provides $2 million in funding for land acquisitions that would expand our wildlife\nmanagement areas, provide outdoor recreational opportunities, and help to conserve our\nendangered and threatened species statewide and then I'll end the amended\nbudget with several capital projects that can be found on page 381. Item 35\nprovides $1.75 million for the North Georgia Mountains Authority for\nimprovements and renovations at Unicoy State Park. Item 36 provides 10.4\n$4 million for a helicopter, for our law enforcement division to support our search and rescue operations.\nWe currently have a fleet of three rotor wings.\nWe would sell one of those rotor wings to keep our fleet at three.\nWe want to replace one of our 407s with a 429, which is a twin engine helicopter and with\nthe increase of rescue missions that were flying in the Gorge, I think, if any of you\nwere in that helicopter during one of those rescue missions,\nyou would certainly want to back up engine.\nShould we have a skiff or a fail?\nItem 37 provides $3 million in funds\nto support facility improvements and renovations\nat our fish hatcheries.\nThroughout the state, we currently have 10 fish hatcheries\nand produce about 11 million fish annually\nat those hatcheries.\nItem 38 provides $1.5 million to replace gangways\nat DNR operated properties throughout the state.\nThat money will be used to replace 67 gangways statewide.\nItem 42 redirects $15 million out of our FY25 funds\nthat was authorized for land acquisition at Polling\nin Dawson Forest to be used for land acquisitions\nat Pine Log Mountain in Bartow County, probably\nbefore it was left our inventory.\nIt's one of our most popular WMAs\nand with the proximity to Atlanta.\nIt's a great investment for the state of Georgia\nto conserve those properties so close by.\nAnd then lastly, for the amended budget on page 384\nundergo bonds issued, this allows us to utilize\nthe remaining proceeds from a bond\nfrom fiscal year 23 that was used for vocal state park for dam repairs.\nThis will allow those monies to be used at other DNR maintained dams.\nAny questions with the amended budget?\nIf not, I'll move on to FY 27.\nWe do have one question on the mended.\nOkay.\nOkay, moving on to FY27, which would begin on page 261.\nEach of our division's budgets you'll see reflects the change in the adjustments to the\nagency premiums for the DOAS administered insurance programs as well as the GTA telecommunications\nand infrastructure rates and the state health benefit plan. Going to coastal resources,\nitem 4, page 261 eliminates the one-time funds that were used for beach restoration in the amount\nof $1 million. This was passed through funding in our FY 26 budget. Under item five also with\nour coastal resources it removes $75,000 in one-time funds for equipment and vehicle cost,\nbut we are retaining the personal services for those positions for the recreational\nfishing data collection. Along those lines I've heard from many of you over the last couple\nyears about Georgia's red snapper fishery and as you know it's managed currently by the\nfederal government we have asked for a federal exempted fishing permit which would allow\nthe state to manage those fish off the Georgia coast.\nWe're very hopeful that we will get that exemption and these monies would be used to help\nus gather that data so that we can provide numbers and manage that fishery as it should\nbe. If you look on page 262 under the Law Enforcement Division, item 2 provides funds to enhance\nthe retirement benefits for select post certified law enforcement officers. We're very appreciative\nof the governor adding that and realizing the challenges of recruitment and retention\nin law enforcement. On that same page under the Georgia Outdoor Stewardship Program,\nitems 1 and 2 show an increase in funds to this program.\nItem 1 restores the 20% reduction that we saw in FY 26 due to the revenues decreasing\nby 1%.\nAnd then more than $5.7 million are restored to the trust fund in FY 27.\nAdditionally, in that program, if you'll look, item 2 shows a $4.9 million increase in\nfunds to the program which will reflect the increase from fiscal year 25\ncollections and that's the collections of sporting goods from sporting goods\nstores and tax. Moving to the park's recreation and historic sites division on\npage 262 item 3 eliminates $7 million that was one time funding for outdoor\nRecreation. Again, these were pass-through funds from the FY26 budget. Item 4\neliminates $300,000 in one-time funds that was dedicated to the SAM shortline\nrailroad. If you'll look on page 263 under the Wildlife Resources Division. Item\n4 shows an increase in funds of over a million dollars for the Wildlife and\ndiamond trust fund that makes that trust fund whole based off the number of lifetime\nlicense that was sold during this past year and then lastly item five provides an increase\nin funds to the amount of $200,000 for additional operational cost at fish hatcheries.\nYou heard me say that we produce about 11 million fish annually that we stock in all\nof Georgia's waters and with the inflation you know that the price of fish food has\ngone up tremendously.\nYou'll see a couple of bond projects in FY27 if you'll look on page 390, item 1 under\nthe Department of Natural Resources provides $4.94 million to fund replacement vehicles\nand emergency equipment of these funds, $1.25 million will go to the gentleman that will\nwill speak after me and $3.69 million will remain in DNR to assist us with new vehicles\nas well as seven aerial ignition drones that will support our fire efforts across the\nstate. Item 2 provides $16.91 million to fund facility major improvements in renovations\nat DNR facilities statewide and again of that $16.91 million, $1.25, we'll go to the environmental\nprotection division and we would retain $15.66 million in DNR. And with that, Mr. Chairman\nand members of this body, I want to thank you for your time today and I'm happy to answer\nany questions.\nWell, here are the good Chair, ladies, Smith.\nRight in front of you.\nGood afternoon.\nFirst of all, I just want to do a shout out to what you and all the employees of DNR are\nable to accomplish with a very small theme for the State of Georgia and also, too, as\nyou're listening, the DNR maintenance and care of our state makes us one of the most attractive\ntourist spot in the country and another plan for Georgia outdoor stewardship\nact. We've got it happening in Georgia and I appreciate you and all the\npeople who work for DNR and what you do. Thank you so much. We're very, very proud of\nthe system that we have provided and that's when I say we that includes\neveryone in this room but the men and women of DNR work hard to make them look\ngood every day with very streamlined budgets. I'm proud to work there\naccomplice.\nLucas.\nI can hear you.\nLet's not try that.\nLet's try grabbing the person beside you if you got mine.\nyou by any chance has the problem by any chance looked at extending this season.\nWe have, we routinely look at those numbers and again what is a healthy population and\nthen you know we have a window that we can change the seasons in.\nOne thing we did this year that was very very popular increased our deer harvest state\nwide was to add two do days prior to fire arm season coming in. So yes, we do look at\nthat almost on an annual basis. And we do have probably probably the most\nliberal dear season of anywhere in the nation. Well, the reason I asked is\nit's been kind of warm and going into wood and it's 75 degrees. They're doing\nto be good, but would the deal still run all night long?\nYes, sir.\nYes, sir.\nYou're not suggesting we stretch that to the dark hours?\nYes.\nRepresentative Mathis.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nMr. I just wanted to say thank you.\nHad an excellent, on a big farmer down in my county.\na bear had totally obliterated a cotton module or a round bell that John did put that toward\nall the pieces I want to know within two hours they had somebody over there trying to attack you\nknow catch the bear traffic that sort of thing and we were really impressed farmers and press I\nwas impressed I had the privilege of going over there what far from where I live and they were\nappreciate it. So I want to say thank you to your folks in the field to y'all to get\nthe message out and come over because we've had several instances where the\nBRD tariff caught my dude and as we were talking earlier we're trying to figure\nout why they're getting into them we've got several theories but I just want\nto say thank you thank you sir. Thank you sir that's simply\nThank you.\nI appreciate that.\nMr. Lee, James.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nI have three, I guess, lakes or waterways that you regulate.\nYes, ma'am.\nThe one for the Tadahoochi is right in South Olson, right at the Douglas County Line.\nAnd we have to do a cleanup so many times that your department has somebody that comes\nto clean up because we have a riding down the hooch, but it's just our key South Fulton\nBeautiful.\nWe do a partner with many volunteer organizations, I know Director Kahn and the Environmental\nProtection Division also sponsor a number of days throughout the year where we do help\nwith cleanup efforts.\nWe have so many, so much trash when we finish.\nWe have at least 10 people who have their own boats.\nSomebody, I don't know whether they're getting approved\nor what, but we have everybody to show up\nand we have vendors to give us the orange jackets\nand the grass and things.\nSo I just, they want to know if they can get something\nfrom the natural resource that I told them\nI would call them all right too.\nWe are happy to partner in the organizing of an event.\nYes, ma'am.\nAnd the other one is Sweetwater Creek.\nAll of that is in my district in Douglas County.\nAnd Roger Bruce just retired.\nAnd he was in the house.\nHe was the house member for that.\nAnd he had let's go fishing once a year.\nAnd everybody wants to know what's\ngoing to happen with it this year.\nBut he told me that I needed to talk to you\nsomebody in your department to see about putting fish in and how I could get\nfishing rods for the little kids. We can certainly do that. Of course, he could come\nout of retirement for a day to help us with that project. Yes, I hope he's listening.\nAnd the last thing is a horrible thing that I was part of. I went to\nSaplow Island for the annual family cultural day and I am glad that I had already\ngone over to the other side because I could see from where I was that people about\n30 people drank some people drowned but they fell off right after I had gone\nof that rap with with my family too. So I wanted to know because they call me the other\nday I want to know if they were going to get the insurance that can come through for\nsome of those people who die. And there are people from Sapporo Island and you know some\nof their airs they don't they own little tiny houses. They want to know what natural resources\nis going to do about pushing the insurance company\nwho is supposed to take care of those individual people.\nAnd that's always going to give me the names,\nand I would send it to the department.\nThat is still probably the most tragic day in DNR history,\nand one of the most tragic days for the state of Georgia.\nThe investigation, believe this or not,\nis still ongoing.\nWe're crossing every tea and dot and every eye\nto make sure that we get it right.\nSo we're probably still a few months away\nfrom the release of the final investigation.\nBut we will certainly keep this body updated\nas that develops.\nThey did replace the ramp that failed.\nBut the thing is still wobbly, so I don't know who.\nI tell people don't get on it.\nWow, it has been replaced.\nIt's being replaced again, and we're way over-engineering this.\nNot that it wasn't engineered properly the first time,\nbut it's going to be very substantial.\nThank you.\nSo I can say you told me that.\nOK.\nAbsolutely.\nI'm going to do that too.\nThank you so much.\nYes, ma'am.\nChairman Yurden.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nappreciate you, Commissioner Beam here with us today and appreciate the job you're\nagency does for the citizens of Georgia. The General Assembly has supported recent\nefforts to improve game warden post certified employee compensation. Has this\nhad a result in improving folks interested in becoming game wardens and\nenrolling in the training? Anything that we can do for any of our\nemployees is a but great service but just it has been a challenge not just for\nDNR law enforcement I think Colonel Hitchens would say the same thing\ndirector Hosey would say the same thing it's been very difficult to\nrecruit people to law enforcement in general and we are part of that we have\nseen a slight uptick in the number of applicants we've had the last couple of\nyears our turnover rate has improved with what you have done and the governor\nhas done over the last several years.\nBut it continues to be a challenge\nto recruit those people that will stick with us\nfor our career.\nThank you, sir.\nChairman Anderson.\nOh, boy.\nCommissioner, just thank you for you and your staff.\nIt's a pleasure to work with you all.\nI would like for you to give us all a little update\non how we help disabled people be able to get into the woods and go hunting.\nWell, you have done that already, y'all.\nI hope that everyone in here would say that you've heard of our outdoors beyond barriers\ninitiative and initiative that we took on two years ago.\nChip Madron was the brain child behind that who is a cancer survivor in a wheelchair.\nWith his idea, his vision, we've built upon that, we've got a statewide program now where\nwe're offering opportunities with any mobility impairments to get out in the woods and\ndo what we do day in and day out and enjoy that.\nWe've expanded that from deer hunting, we've had dove hunting, we've had some turkey hunting,\na number of fishing events across the state.\nthat program's just going to continue to build a super proud of the small staff that has\nput that together. But again, all of you have supported those efforts in your local communities.\nAnd if you have a contact in your communities and would like to see one of those events\ncome to your area, please reach out because we've gotten the tools. Now we're just trying\nto get our message out to the people that can capitalize on this great initiative.\nChairman sayings.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nAnd I want to preface this in thanking your department for working with our office with\nthis local input.\nBut I know as the revenue has increased in recent years, there's also been some local\nconcerns in terms of the department's larger land acquisitions and the changes that\ndoes to local revenue, has there been any changes in terms of the local input process when\nwe're making large acquisitions and determining the appropriateness?\nWe do hear that.\nYou know, if you look at the DNR inventory across the state, I don't think that it's big\nenough to adversely, greatly adversely affect, you know, tax incomes.\nI would say to that is the economic impact that comes from hunters and anglers coming\nin and staying in your hotels and motels and camping in our state parks should offset\nany of the tax concerns with that.\nBut yes, that is something that we do follow closely.\nWe're not out there, happy, miserably, buying every piece of dirt that's for sale.\nAgain, those that have the greatest conservation value, those that we're able to manage efficiently\nbecause they already join some of our properties or what really gets our attention.\nThank you Commissioner Arabin, that's all, that's all your questions, thank you.\nThank you.\nNext up is Director Johnny Sabo with the Farns Street Commission.\nHow are you going to go?\nI didn't have you down, sorry.\nGo ahead. Go ahead. It's not the first time I've been forgotten, Mr. Chairman.\nHow could we forget you? Good afternoon, Chairman Hatchett,\nChairman Tillery. My name is Jeff Kahn. I'm the Director of the Environmental Protection Division of the Department of Natural Resource.\nThank you for this opportunity to speak with you all today, and I will be quick.\nwill be quick. But first off I wanted to say that I began working the environment of Georgia\nin 1990 and I want to let everybody know today that our air, our land and our water are cleaner\nand they continue to be clean. I attribute that to the EPD team and the partners. This\nbody here for given us the appropriate laws and tools to do our job and our dinner board\nto set the policies for us and I'm really proud to be working on this for the last, this\nthis is about 36 years and that.\nNow onto the budget.\nI want to thank Governor Camp and Director Dunn\nfrom OPB that have continued hard work on our budget.\nThis recommendation gives us the resources\nand funding to succeed to the end of the fiscal year 26\nand end of fiscal year 27.\nLooking forward to work with you\nin the Chairman and the General Assembly\nas a whole as we go through this process.\nAs far as the amended FY26 is pretty short for us,\nwe have a little over 1.5 million for one time.\npays supplement of 2,000 to our full-time site employees.\nAnd we really appreciate that being fully funded.\nThat helps us a lot, because we have a lot of fee funded\nand federal fund of positions.\nThen on our solid waste and trust,\nand our has waste trust fund, there's no changes\nin the mid-26.\nNow I'll go into the full fiscal year 27 budget, which\nwill start in within the DNR budget.\nOn page 261, we have the normal statewide adjustments,\n76,000 for DOAS insurance programs, reduction\nof 8,800 to reflect adjustments for our telecommunications\nand infrastructure for Georgia Technology Authority,\nand also a reduction of over 1.1 million to reflect\nand that reduction in the employer\nof contribution rate of state health benefit plan.\nNext on page 262, we have a true up to the hazardous waste\ntrust fund to align the budget\nwith fiscal year 25 collections,\nwhich resulted in an increase of $3.1 million.\nThis is attributed to when the collections\nof these funds come in.\nSometimes they come in a little before July 1,\nsometimes a little after.\nSo we have to true it up at each session to keep it straight.\nAnd then on page 266, we also have a true up\nwith the Solid Waste Trust Fund.\nThe new replacement tire fund is a true up with the 25\ncollections, the increase of 270,000.\nThen on page 390, the commissioner sort of talked\nabout this.\nThe first is a capital expenditure for $1.25 million\nto do some improvements to our Brunswick office.\nWe do a lot of work there at our Brunswick office.\nThe project will be in two phases.\nThe first phase will replace the metal panel roof,\nand we'll add more offices to accommodate our water quality\nteam.\nWe're doing a lot of ambient water quality\nand water on the coast.\nAnd then in phase two, which will be requested in the future,\nwe'll focus on a shuttered boat storage, as well\nas parking, grading, and pavement improvements.\nThen next, far as replacement of our vehicles,\nWe got about 1.2 million, $80,000 will be to replace the aging air monitoring shelter at United Avenue monitoring site in Atlanta.\nThis is where we do our ambient air quality monitoring.\nWe have 25,000 for a backup air monitoring equipment at our South to cab monitoring site.\nWe have $510,000 to replace four pieces of laboratory equipment.\nThis equipment will support our drinking water analysis for water systems across the state as well as our water quality work.\nAnd finally, we've got $565,000 to purchase and replace\n12 vehicles that are eligible for BOS's replacement\nthrough their methodology.\nChairman, thank you for your time,\nand I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.\nRight now, you have one, Representative Buckner.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nHere I am.\nWith the hazardous waste trust fund,\nis there a list somewhere of the projects\nthat are funded with those funds that are brought\ninto the fund.\nYes, ma'am, it's all but has a side inventory facilities.\nIt's all our old leaking landfills and all,\nbut yes, ma'am, we can get you a list.\nOkay, thank you.\nI'll get you information on that.\nThat'd be great.\nAnd then for the solid waste trust fund,\nwe use that to try to promote recycling,\nand the idea behind that was to try not to fill up\nour landfills so we don't have to cite anymore.\nYou don't have to do this, you know, but the capacity of our landfills compared to what\nwe're doing with recycling, I'd be interested in knowing if we're where we are with that.\nSo mainly our two things there is to clean up tires and promote, make sure that the enforcement\nand permitting of tires carriers and car processors, tires, those operations are done in courts\nwith our rules and regs.\nAlso we have a lot of recycling grants that we're moving forward trying to create a help\ncreate a circular economy in the state which will keep waste out of our landfills and\nit will also help businesses start up in Georgia to recycle a lot of these materials.\nSo yes, ma'am.\nChair and Lynn Smith.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nRight here in front of me.\nSo I want to back you up on what you said about improving our environment, land, air,\nand water.\nWhen I was first selected, the greater part of the Atlantic area was in the non-attainment\nzone.\nAnd no business, no industry, all of these things were on hold, and I'm taking years,\nbut y'all done a great job with that with not that many people now.\nSo thank you.\nYou're welcome.\nThank you.\nIt's our team that does all that great work with y'all's help.\nThank you.\nRepresentative Glaze.\nThank you.\nI wanted to ask if you guys have a list of municipalities who are no longer involved in recycling.\nAnd the reason I asked that is there, I know that we have the grant money to help support and encourage that,\nbut it's there are some cities in my district who have moved away from recycling.\nFor me, that's a great concern.\nconcerned as much work as we've done to get a better\npolity of water air and soil. We need to make sure that our\ncities are continuing to join this state effort.\nYes, ma'am, our program that is headed by Leah Sassoni works to\ndo that, but we'll also work with the Georgia Municipal\nAuthority and the Association and County Commission of\nGeorgia to try to get the message out on this grant\nopportunities and work with these local governments to help\nthem set up things that hopefully will help it continue\nwon't into the future, yes ma'am.\nWould you be able to provide that to us so that we can get that to those municipalities\nthat we know have moved away from recycling?\nYes ma'am.\nThank you so kindly.\nThat's all the questions.\nDirector, thank you for being here this afternoon.\nThank you.\nI will move to our next item.\nMr. Sabah from the Forestry Commission, Director.\nI've got a PDF version, but did you want to plug in your PowerPoint?\nYeah, because I got a video, that's okay.\nSure, sure.\nI'm about to point it out, it's sorry.\nNo, sorry.\nI would copy it, though, because this thing, you would be poured out notice in that.\nSo, is it not?\nYes, sir, it is.\nGlad you flew in the top to us.\nI didn't quite fly in, but yes sir.\nWe'll talk about that too.\nSo good afternoon, Mr. Chairman.\nCommittee, thank you all for this opportunity to present today.\nI'm going to run through a variety of things.\nBut the first thing that I want to do is recognize a few folks in the audience.\nOne is my deputy director, Mr. Chris Butler.\nHe's back here in the corner.\nThis CFO, Ms. Michelle Gray right here.\nAnd then two gentlemen when I asked how do they want to be introduced?\nBecause they're pretty integral to something we're doing when they said just bow and Andy.\nAnd I love that, so two of our five members from Georgia Tech back here, so if we get into\ntechnical questions later on, I will absolutely defer to them.\nI always like to remind everybody of our mission, vision, core values.\nAnd really, this comes into play more now than ever, especially using facts to drive our decisions\nand being responsible for our own success.\nAnd I'm going to play into that a little bit, but especially when we start talking about\nthe force industry and how does Georgia climb out of the hole that we are currently in.\nFirst a little update from last year and recovery efforts.\nI appreciate the funding for tractors last year, so we have received five of the tractors\nso far and 24 are expected within, within a month.\nWe are rapidly gaining that equipment in and we will be ready to go this spring season.\nThe fuel mitigation program, the 135 million, 132 of that was allocated for the cost share\nprogram with landowners.\nAll of it is still allocated, so for $7.9 million paid and one thing that we did, if you\nall noticed, we had a second sign up.\nWe called every single applicant, asked them where they are, did they plan on using the\nfunds, do they need help, what constraints do they have, and how can we help them.\nAnd most of them said they plan on using the funds or waiting on cost share.\nWe had roughly 16 million turned back in from Landon or Sainte.\nThey were going to use EFRP, the federal program.\nSo that's where we did the second sign up with the 16 million to account for that.\nAnd more than enough in reserve, if we have to do anything further, as far as landowners\nwanting help.\nAs far as one neat product we did with that program is landowners said they wanted help,\nbut they couldn't find a contractor.\nWe then worked through the master logger program with UGA to find loggers who were looking\nfor work.\nAnd all the log and equipment is not the best equipment in the world for debris cleanup.\nYou can do it.\nAnd so we have loggers getting involved and helping clean up Palin just, you know, looks\nIt's a little bit different, but some of them are getting creative, but in rakes on\nour front of their skaters and different things like that.\nSo, happy we could help find work for some of the loggers.\nThe fire breaks and forest road programs, we have finished with all the initial sign-ups.\nWe're still continuing to do that for free in the impact area.\nToday, over 3,700 miles have line put in.\nYou see the hours, over 11,000 hours, and that is just in that immediate impact area,\nreally into the worst of the worst.\nBut that doesn't include all the other lines around the state and everything that we've\nbeen doing.\nAll right.\nI want to jump right into the governor's forgery task force before I kind of come back\nto more traditional GFC ask.\nI want to start with the mass timber building and I've heard a few questions about that and\nthe wood and the lie and I want to one thing to governor, I think he teed it up nicely\nwhen we talk about building with mass timber in the state.\nSo when we look at nationally, you know, population densities are actually supposed to decrease\nand go down, lumber, dimensional lumber, or it is tied to new starts.\nWhen I say new starts, that's new construction.\nSo if we think new construction is going to go down what it has been, then how do we\nfind other uses for this wood to increase construction?\nAnd mass timber is an outstanding answer for it.\nThere are some discrepancies in what cost are for mass timber to build mass timber.\nI'll just be honest and it looks like some of the numbers are on average about 10% higher\nto bill with mass timber.\nBut you're getting a superior product, carbon sequestration, natural resources where the\nnumber one for sure is state in the nation and there's no reason that we shouldn't be\ndoing it.\nThe other thing it will do is if we start building with mass timber from an agency perspective,\nGFC has 101 offices around the state.\nWe have 37 that need serious repair or rebuilding and I think about all of our other agency\npartners, we're in prime position to attract a mass timber facility into\nnortheast Georgia where they have market access to Atlanta, Chattanooga,\nAsheville, Greenville, all these cities that are utilizing mass timber. So then\nwe start finding another market in an avenue for our wood, but we have to start\nsomewhere. So that's my commitment here is we get this done, let GFC figure it\nout, where can we find efficiencies building with mass timber within the state,\nget the product we need, a product that's going to be around for 100 years, and then go forward.\nThe Georgia Grown Wood product, phase two, we're asking for a one-time six-hundred-sixteen-deam-ended\nbudget, and sorry I should say all these asking are in our AFY-26. Phase one at its heart was\ncontent development. There's some meat on the bone and push out with it, but phase two really\nstarts working with economic development and others to how do we put our\nself number one in the line for trying to attract industry. And if you think\nabout it, South Carolina lost markets a couple years ago, Alabama's lost\nmarkets before that, Mississippi before them and Arkansas. So if you're\nindustry and you're looking to come in, your cost of wood is a that is a major\nfactor into when you're building industry, right? And if you're your input\ncost are significantly cheaper somewhere else than why should they go\nwith our input cost are a little bit higher. Well, number one, number one, state\nto do business, you know, we just need to show it off and show off our\ninfrastructure, our ports, and everything else that we have. And this Georgia\nGreenwood project would allow us to do that. The last one, the one I'm really\nmost excited about, and I'm going to apologize because I'm actually just\ngoing to read something straight, which I hate to do, but it is the Georgia\nForestry Innovation Initiative in partnership with Georgia Tech and I'll\nset this up to say there's a lot of stuff that flies around and the forestry\ntask force took a deep dive into and one big one sustainable aviation fuel and\nall these other markets. Well what's not widely known is that's pretty much\nhamstrung by the renewable fuel standards at a federal level. I don't know if\nyou've tried to change anything at a federal level lately but it's pretty\ntough and so we're looking for something what can we do with our small\ndiameter wood because that's what we lost with the paper mills. How do we use that product\nand we make it sustainable and not just sustainable but profitable. It doesn't have to be subsidized.\nWe're not looking for rules or regulation. It's just good sound business. So the folks at Georgia\nTech have been doing a lot of work behind the scenes to get to where we are now and could not\nthank them enough. But if you'll bear with me, I'm going to read this real quick. The Georgia\nForestry Innovation Initiative will enable forest industry expansion into manufacture of high value\nof carbon, charcoal-related products,\nsolvents for automotive coatings and pharmaceuticals.\nBe established by the Georgia Forestry Commission\nand Georgia Tech, and we'll engineer, design, test,\nand transfer these technologies\ninto concrete business activities.\nThe two-year economic impact could add up to 2 billion\nto Georgia's GDP, and it will mature to grow up\nto 80 billion supporting thousands of rural Georgia jobs\nand utilizing roughly 12 million metric tons of wood.\nNow I want to stop right here, because what we lost\nwhen those mills close was about 8.2 million tons of wood\nand 4 million tons in Georgia.\nSo if we get a third of this right,\nwe've replaced a market that we've lost in the state.\nThese projections are dependent on health investment\nand piloting and technology to business transfer\nand to help incentivize investment.\nSo they've done the research, they've done the studies,\nthey've done the lab work.\nThis is going from that tabletop to scale up\nand moving forward beyond that.\nThere's multiple force industries that's\ninterested in this project.\nThere's a lot of visionaries out there,\nbut there's still some risks.\nSo that's what this is helping the state take\na little bit of that risk away.\nAnd to me, 10.9 is not a huge ask\nwhen we think about a 2 billion GDP return in a couple of years.\nAnd if we want to go more depth on that one\non the what and how, that's where I will absolutely\nget my friends from Georgia Tech up here.\nKeep it on AFY 26.\nWalter left the room talking about helicopters this is the helicopter that you\nappropriated last year I want to thank you for that it is in Virginia we should\ntake ownership of it next what we were planning on this week but the you know\nthe weather nice stormer like why don't you leave it up there under shelter\nbefore we even bring it down here it's gonna be a little bit different\nanything we've ever had if you see this the snorkel dangling down below it will\nactually fly over suck up water has greater care and capacity and we're very\nexcited about what this will bring and what this will mean to our fleet.\nJust in case anybody has the questions, no, it's not there all the time.\nIt kind of tucks up in and out the way.\nJust really want to thank the governor for the Employee Supplement Fund, that is massive\nwhen we talk about turnover and employee morale and what that means for our agency.\n107,000 operational funds for the new helicopter.\nYou'll see the full amount in FY27, but that's essentially the last quarter to cover the\nfull amount when we think about fuel maintenance and everything else when we have an addition\nto fleet.\n10.9 for the Georgia Forestry Innovation Initiative.\nThat's what we just talked about with Georgia Tech and 148,000 in the past refunding to\nTablet County.\nAs far as capital outlay, 2.6 for mass timber that we just went over, and then 12 million\nfor tractor replacement, and I want to touch on that one a little bit, and I'm going to\nshow the importance of why here later, but last year we were asking for 10.9 in the amended\nand we had 1.1 in our actual operating budget. This year that 1.1 is going to be shifted\nand we'll show that and so we won't have the full 12 million if you will go and forward.\nSo the 12 million is actually going to be an amended budget as we move, but that 1.1\nwe really need for operational funds. So when we get into the FY27 budget, when you\nyou see that 1.01 in operating funds.\nThat's what we had for equipment replacement.\nNow it's being taken out of that\nand moved to operational funds.\nOn average, our average fire response now\nis costing us $480 more per fire.\nSo when we talk about 4,000 wildfires in a year,\nit's just taking more to attack the fire.\nFuel goes up.\nI don't have to tell you all inflation is going up,\nbut honestly, it's just more people and more manpower,\nespecially in the impact area.\n428,000 for the helicopter.\nThat's what we just talked about, 107 in the amended for the last quarter, and that\nwill help with operational funds in our aviation fleet as well.\nFull support for the 2.4,000 and a poster to five law enforcement officers, many folks\naren't aware, but GFC actually has law enforcement officers in.\nWe do arts investigation, timber theft, partner with Fire Marshall's office, DNR, and we\nWe actually arrested one arsonist this past week and we're on one another and another\none this week and I won't get too much deeper than that but they do a lot of good work\nand a lot of times they go and notice and to me that just means they're doing their job\nand it's couldn't think that group enough.\nCapital 1.7 for light duty vehicles so that's everything from engines to transport support\nto trackers, chief ranger trucks, things like that, 1.6 for major maintenance and repair\nand then little over a million for new construction,\nfor a truck shed and coffee counting.\nAnd of course, this was all done before,\nthe kind of mass timber movement when we put this in here,\nbut of course we're gonna look to do that\nwith mass timber as well, so that is the absolute goal.\nAnd I would like to pause for a second\nto point this picture out.\nIf you'll look at that picture,\nit doesn't really look like Georgia,\nbut it's a pretty neat moment.\nWe had 12 boys and girls from this state fly up to Alaska,\nand they handed them the number one priority fire in the nation,\nwhich means it could not be ripping any more,\ncould not be doing any more damage,\nand they've turned it over to a bunch of people\nfrom Georgia up in Alaska,\nand could not be more proud of them for two weeks,\nnot gonna say they stopped the fire,\nnot when their conditions like that,\nbut no one was hurt and no homes lost\nand protected everything, everything critical to the state.\nSo, really proud of our team for what they did.\nMoving in just kind of a wildfire outlook,\nand I know this feels a little weird,\nseeing as we're bracing for an ice storm,\nBut it's there and it's real.\nSo the governor mentioned over 4,000 wildfires, 26,000 acres.\nWe have seen an increase in wildfires.\nAnd it's cyclical, and now we have a lot of fuel loading\nfrom Helene, which we talked about last year.\nThis fiscal year, when we looked at just this fiscal year\nand set a calendar year, so far, we're halfway\nto that 4,000 again.\nSo we're still tracking for a high year.\nAnd the one number I did want to throw out in some of y'all\nin this room may not like that as I'm looking at center\nGoodman. Um, as we talk about Okie Finokie Swamp and when we talk about using\ndata and facts to drive our decisions, I'm not saying this is going to happen. I\nhope it doesn't happen. I really hope I'm wrong. But that 52 inches annual\nprecipitation is pretty important down there. So when we go back to 2006, we only\nhad 40 inches. 2007 was a terrible year. 2010. We got 36 inches. 2011 was a\na terrible year. 16, 47 inches. We know what 17 was and so far in 25 we've had 41\ninches. So that swamp is really dry. Everything surrounding the swamp is dry. Our whole\nsoutheast corner right now it's just a tender box. So this rain we're getting is not\ngoing to mitigate that. It's going to give us about a week off at most to kind\nof rehab our equipment and get ready to go again. Kind of proved my point when\nfire is going like this at night. These are all within the last couple weeks. That\nnot a good time. Usually night humidity comes up, Wednesday down and we're able to catch it.\nWhen you see pictures like on your, where's it? Your bottom left here and it's spot\ndown or front of itself in the middle of the night, that's not fun. So those are the kind of\nconditions that we're facing right now and quite honestly the lines that we've pre-established\nhave been a big help, roads and we're just going to continue to be aggressive on putting in lines,\npre-establishing lines, work with landowners and be aggressive to the scene as soon as we get\nit called. And wanted to play this for you. We're leaning more and more into technology.\nSo we had a big swamp fire in Ackison County. Could not access it. Could not get into it.\nAnd so we utilize a drone to light it off in the middle and then light the edges to where\nit starts burning coming together. And I thought you all may appreciate this one. It's a quick\n30 second clip. So it's hard to see, but the drones drop in what we call dragon eggs. And\nthis Dragon Age will eventually line on fire.\nAnd then when it starts burning to come together,\nthe interesting part was the landowner told us,\nhis whole life, he's never seen that swamp dry\nand it's dry right now.\nSo it's just, yeah, once again, sorry,\nusing that in fact to drive our decisions\nand then just a wildfire outlook.\nSo we'll continue to be prepared for ice storms,\nwildfires, whatever it is, but I could not think,\nthis community, this body enough for the support\nyou've given us, because without you and without your support, we would really be ineffective\nin doing our job, so it is critical.\nAnd thank you and happy to take any questions.\nChairman Carter.\nThank you.\nJust outside my pay grade, obviously, but I know that there are some folks that are taking\nwood pellets and shipping them over to Europe and making power with them.\nAnd my question is, how far off are we from an economic standpoint, for being able to\nto do that in a state that's clearly hungry for power.\nHas there been anybody talking about that\nor is environmental regulations too much for it to work?\nYes, I won't say the regulations are too much.\nThere's a lot of conversation on that,\nno matter if I was with the speaker before I came in here\nand we were having that same conversation\nabout moving forward.\nSo there's a lot of conversation revolving around that,\nbut at the end of the day, it's got to work\nin the right place and the numbers have to work too.\nSo that's, I wanna say that's the driving factor.\nSome of that starts, I'll be honest with you,\nI went to school to grow trees and like things on fire,\nso it starts to get over me just a little bit,\nbut it's really more about,\nis that the most efficient use as far as the electricity\nand everything else, and in some cases,\nit probably is, and so we're diving deep into that.\nYeah, I mean, I just think there's a lot of people\ntalking about coming in to backfill overflows\nand selling it at a premium.\nAnd if you could sell it at a premium,\nthen the math might work.\nSo, anyway, appreciate you.\nYes, sir, thank you.\nChair, we do.\nGood.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nI just want to thank you.\nHow long had you been over the Forest Commission\nwhen the hurricane hit?\n10 days.\n10 days.\nAnd I just want to tell you all,\nI mean, the work that your agency did,\ngetting out and chainsaw crews and clearing up roads and really the work that\ny'all do every day but also the work that you've done with me and others in\nthe legislature and helping craft legislation. I mean your service on this\ntask force you know two-thirds of the states covered in Timberland and so\nanybody that doesn't think that what happens in the forestry industry doesn't\naffect all of Georgia I promise you that you know that it does and really\nThere's something that I've talked to you about before I'm going to bring it up, but y'all now where I live at\nI live it's 11 miles to the closest place to buy gas and\nYou all are really the last line of defense and that's the reason everything we got and y'all fought\n4,000 nearly 4,100 fires, right? Yes, sir and we're talking about the swamp. I remember in 2007\nI was on that fire and it was two o'clock in the morning and I wish everybody in this room could be there to experience\nThat's what he's talking about because the humidity gets real low and the fire spot in\nthree miles ahead of you and it literally sounds like a freight train and it's creating\nits own weather and it's sucking so much oxygen feeding the fire that when you stand on\na dirt road it's like a sandblaster on your face because that fire is pulling oxygen\nso fast.\nAnd I remember Buck Lyne who's retired now but he was over lands in the near chief\nRanger, two o'clock in the morning, he strikes out, he fits a thing around his face where\nhe can breathe, if you can't breathe.\nAnd he and about 20 other tractors went off into the woods, you know, and I'm just\nremembering praying God help him get back, you know.\nAnd so one of the things that before I leave this building, that I hope that he get done\nand I'm speaking for me now, not for you, but I'm speaking for me, 4,100 fires.\nguys that are fighting these fire y'all are heroes and they cannot participate in the state fire\nfire suspension and that is something that I hope that everybody in this room before I go back\nto Cobbdale and hang it up or the folks and staffs will just send me home that that we can do\nthat because those folks deserve it and I just honestly thank you for being my friend but you\nreally I'm you've done a great job and you were thrown into the fire and I'm proud of you\nI'm proud of your agency.\nThank you, Senator.\nI couldn't thank you enough for your support\nand everybody's supporting.\nIt's a great team.\nIt's not just me, outstanding team.\nSo, yes, sir.\nChairman Tarman.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nI will echo what Senator Goodman said as he made over\nmarks. I had the chill bumps on arms,\nfrom experiences I've had when I was a child.\nDirector, every year when he made the drops and the wind picks up and you look out and\nsee all the places that are grown up and I think of you and your predecessors.\nThe questions I've got is one for employee safety and the other for logistics.\nOver the years this is what I think I've ever, ever followed when we get into this season.\nthe cab tractor situation as far as percentages elaborate a little bit on if our percentages\nof course are picking up I'm sure they are and the logistics problem we had years ago was\nsome of the heavy equipment been able to get it moved around the state properly aren't we\nare we pretty much stocked up in regions at least before we can move the larger equipment\nand again thank you for what you guys do yet yes sir thank you for the comments so I'll start\nstart with the logistics question and moving around the state, that is absolutely\nsolved and a lot of that sometimes depends on the personnel to move the\nequipment, right? And I could not be more proud to say that our turnover rate, if\nI take out retirements because in my mind, you know, you do 30 plus years, you\ndeserve to retire, work 3.2%. So that really helps solve that logistics problem of\nmoving equipment, getting it around the state pretty quick. Even with retirements\nSo we're not talking about a huge jump.\nAs far as open cab tractors, we didn't work with OPB for several years to put a plane in place.\nThere's 12 million that were asked for and amended as part of that plan.\nWe replaced roughly a third that we had left, before last year we had 100.\nSo we replaced roughly a third of those two more shots of 12 million.\nWe'll take care of all of our open cab tractors.\nand then the goal is to bump it back down to like a six or seven million a year\nand that'll put us on a 20 year replacement cycle. So that's the that's the\nvision. Yes sir. Thank you. Chairman Peter. Thank you Mr. Chairman and thank you\ndirector. You don't know how much I appreciate all y'all do. Those guys in\nStapleton do a marvelous job. Brandon Davis and all those guys. Y'all do great work.\nI wanted to ask you, you mentioned, we can't do enough for you guys, first of all, in my opinion,\ntwo-thirds of the states in Standing Timber, and a lot of people don't realize that, and\nyou're going to lot to do.\nBut you mentioned the 8.2 million tons of what we've lost in Georgia.\nThat's huge loss of demand.\nTo what degree, an issue we're working on, a transferability of tax credits, job tax\ncredits, investment tax credits, in your opinion, to what degree would that be helpful for\nus to get?\nYou mentioned Mass.\nTimber, biofuel was mentioned by the chairman up on the podium there.\nSo tell us, tell me what your thoughts are on transferability of tax credits.\nWell, I go right back to, we're in competition with other states and there's a lot of fine\npeople in some of those surrounding states.\nAnd so we're at the back of the line because we started last and somehow we got to get\nto the front of the line.\nAnd so anything that we can utilize to attract industry\nto this state, to either attract industry,\nand if it uses a load of wood, it's good.\nThat's kind of our motto.\nSo, that's true.\nAll right, this fourth line over here,\nyou don't need to get together.\nChairman Smith, Chair Lady.\nThank you, right, and frame me.\nLook, dammit.\nSo, first of all, to the people who are listening,\ndo not live out in rural areas where there's farming. Georgia, and with the help of Georgia\nTech and some other groups, we were the first state in the nation to do carbon credits.\nAnd the innovation and blindness to stick your head up and look around to keep advancing\nthis forward has been a great benefit to Georgia. I think city dwellers need to see what\nMass timber actually looks like it's not something they readily identify with but it's safe as any other product used to\nconstruction but overall and to all of our presenters this afternoon\nthat we ask these agencies to do a whole lot with little resources and so I greatly appreciate what you did.\nThank you. Chairman Yurna. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nThank you, Director. Appreciate that code.\nWhat everybody else said about the job y'all do\nfor the state of Georgia.\nOh, and I love the aspects of\nmass timber and what the\npossibilities are there.\nDo you have an eye?\nHow many in the United States\nhave any manufactures of\nmass timber are there?\nI will have to get that answer back to you for the United States.\nBut I do know if we want to use southern yellow pine,\nthere's one that we use in that smart lamb and dofen.\nwith them. So, very good. Thank you.\nRepresentative Mathis.\nDirector, I appreciate you very much.\nYes, sir. I want to throw out one little thing here about\nArrowhead seed orchard. A lot of people don't know what that does in the state of Georgia\nwhen they go up and they pollinate these trees, they graft trees, they've increased from\n30 years down to about 12 years or 10 years on growth on fulcwood. It's amazing what\nthey do and how they do it and how they catalog it. I know they work with DNR\nconfined up there on the land that we have there. It's part and\nflasky part and blackly. My senator Walker here, he's part of that. And I\nalso just to listen to the North Carolina state people that are involved in\nthat and how they graph these trees, it is unbelievable. And I wouldn't\nencourage anybody in the timber business anything that grows timber to come\ndown and watch them when they bagged the trees and they pollinate certain things to get a certain\ntreat. I was amazed and I believe they're my whole life and I didn't know they did what they do\nup there until I got in the legislature and was invited to go up and see that. But I do thank you\nfor some of the equipment improvements that you've given us over there, the tree shaker. They have\nto shake all those cones to get down and I know it would wear out a few... Not a fun ride, is it?\nYeah, since from 1976 the same tree shaker, so that was a video, but there are a few more needs down there\nAnd I'll talk to you on the side about that and I appreciate it, but I do encourage anybody\nI'm very happy you brought that up. So I'm proud to say right here for everybody that my\nTeam was ahead of me and there's two that will be there in March\nThank you very much\nThank you. I was going to mention that you had come in and just in a minute you were\nfaced with a hurricane and then you were faced with the mill closures and you've been faced\nwith the residual from the storm which is a fire hazard or opportunity that will have\nto face in the next few weeks. And I guess this is going to feel like well what do you\nyou won't for me now, but there's a lot of the state of Georgia that don't understand\nhow important forestry is to the entire state.\nWe've said several and said that.\nThere used to be a line item in the budget for the commission for education, particularly\nin the schools.\nAnd I remember when it was cut drastically, is there any money left in your budget anymore\nfor education in our public in our school systems to the youth about the\nimportance of far. We do I mean to your pointers on a line item we have one\ndedicated designated person that that is their full-time job works with project\nlearning trees schools sits on multiple committees and then develops materials\nand handouts that we did in train our county units our chief rangers forsters\nand gives them you know fresh new products year in a year out that we'll find\nfederal grants for to then implement in classrooms.\nUm, so I'm glad to hear that because I think we did need to keep people informed.\nAnd all we have to do is offer smokey and they take us in every time.\nSo that's, yeah.\nThank you.\nThank you for all you've done.\nThis man's list.\nI'm sorry.\nI know you're trying to rush and I'll be quiet.\nBut we've had so many people upset about the mill closures and I've gotten so many calls\nand I usually call him immediately after they call me so I can share the pain.\nHe's been very gracious.\nThank you.\nDirector, thank you a lot.\nAlso, just a parting comment on a reminder\nthat Representative Jordan Ridley is certified\nin wildfire management and fighting fire.\nSo if you need him, he said he'd volunteer back there.\nThat is good to know.\nWe'll put him in work.\nTake him on crossover day, that'll help us with the fight.\nThank you.\nThank you.\nNext up is Commissioner Nguyen.\nAnd they were done.\nAh.\nJust kidding.\nWe're going to hear from Director Nguyen.\nAll right.\nYou're going to use that twice, right?\nCommissioner Nguyen.\nThank you so much and I know that I'm the 40th of your presenters over the last couple of days\nI started to bring some milk and bread for y'all because I know you've been sequestered away\nBut I think there's still plenty there\nChairman members of the Appropriations Committees. I'm Christopher Nunn Commissioner of the Department of Community Affairs\nAnd I'm delighted to be here with you today to give you a little bit of an update and share our budget. I will be\nDo my best to be brief and to the point\nA quick reminder, DCA is the state's community development agency.\nWe support community planning and economic development, infrastructure, financing and housing.\nWe focus on helping build strong, vibrant communities, which, as you know, includes access\nto affordable housing.\nAs one of 53 state and territory housing finance agencies, DCA effectively delivers solutions\nfor home ownership and safe affordable housing.\nSo I'm going to work off of your sheet.\nI don't have a presentation.\nIn section 16 of your budget documents,\nyou will find a handful of agency recommendations.\nAnd I want to first start by thanking Governor Kemp\nand the legislature for your support for our state employees.\nWhen I left the private sector, I didn't really\nhave a clear idea of what to expect.\nBut I have had the pleasure of working\nwith some of the most talented and dedicated employees\nindividuals and state government. And of course, I'm biased to DCA, but I will tell you\nthat extends beyond DCA to all of the agencies across the state, director Sabo, enjoy partnering\nwith him, Rick Dunn, who will be up here after me. I really appreciate the talent that\nwe get to work with, and I thank you for recognizing the hard work of these professionals.\nWhile important and impactful, our work can be thankless at times, and I appreciate\nyour full consideration of the proposed one-time supplement that's reflected\nthroughout the budget. Under at line 703, under housing initiatives, you will\nnote a $50 million proposed one-time funds to the State Housing Trust Fund to\naddress homelessness across the state. So it is our intent to roll out a\nflexible competitive grant program with these funds, and I'll just break this down into\nthree basic things. First, you've heard me share a 2020 GAO study that shows a strong\nlink between rent and homelessness, specifically a resulting 9% increase in homelessness for\nfor every $100 increase in median rent.\nIn fact, homelessness is a complex issue\nand it affects urban and rural areas alike.\nWith these funds, it is our intent\nto focus on the issues of unsheltered homelessness.\nSo the unsheltered population is on our streets.\nSecond, we recognize that while $50 million\na lot of money. At the same time when you consider the housing needs statewide, it's not that much.\nAnd so in order to stretch these funds even further, we do expect for these competitive\napplications to include matching funds. I've already had conversations with a number\nof philanthropic providers and with communities. Solutions to homelessness are best defined\nat the local level. This initiative is aimed to support locally driven initiatives by providing\nflexible funds that are leveraged by local and philanthropic matching funds, thus stretching\nthe $50 million even further. And finally, while solutions in Atlanta and Savannah may look\ndifferent from those in Gainesville, Tifton, or Statesboro, we do plan to require all grant\nrecipients to provide us with the data so that we'll have a better grasp of the scale of this\nimportant issue statewide. I'm sure there are questions, but I'm going to continue through\nChairman with the budget. Under at line 717, I must say with the George Environmental\nfinance authority I hated to see my friend and colleague Hunter Hill leave in\nNovember but I'm excited to be working alongside Trey Bennett who is the new\nexecutive director at Jeefa and I expect that you will hear from him in the\nsubcommittee hearings. At line 717 you will see the proposed edition of\n$35 million. Last session Senate Bill 13 expanded Jeefa's\nresponsibilities to include project financing for natural gas facilities. This\nThis amount simply provides startup capital for such projects.\nMoving to one Georgia, in its first 25 years, one Georgia has made significant impact\nall across the state, especially in our more rural communities.\nThat work continued in 2025, with $12.5 million awarded to 11 communities for industrial\ncapacity and recruitment.\nThe recruitment activities entailed 3,067 jobs in places like Cedar Town, Metter, Midway,\nand Warnton.\nIn addition, workforce housing and site development initiatives continue to address important\ncommunity needs.\nLast year, we extended 11 workforce housing infrastructure grants in Kero, Carrollton,\nDouglas Coffee County, Gilmer County, Greensboro,\nHagen, Lee'sboro, Moultrie, Richmond County,\nSwainsboro, and Tomiston.\nAnd the pipeline in that program remains strong.\nAt line 725, this relates to an FY26 legislative\nad for disaster recovery.\nYou appropriated $25 million to assist communities\naffected by Hurricane Helene.\nand we stood up in one Georgia, a new program,\nand conducted two grant cycles,\nproviding assistance to 17 communities,\nin Appling, Bullock, Glenn, Hancock,\nIrwin Jeff Davis, Jefferson, Lawrence Lincoln,\nLowns McDuffy, Richmond,\nScriven, Tiff, Tooms and Wilkes counties.\nThis proposed reduction in the budget reflects\nall of those remaining funds,\nwhich we recommend moving to Ag and Forestry budgets\nas you just heard from Director Sabo\nto address ongoing timber-related disaster needs.\nAlso on line 726,\nthe governor recommends an additional $15 million\nfor a successful site development initiative\nthat was launched 18 months ago.\nThe impetus for this initiative is the demand\nafter successful deployments of sites\nhave been developed in conjunction with one Georgia over its first 25 years. These small\nto mid-sized industrial tracks enable local leaders to grow their local economies. However,\nmany have been deployed amid unprecedented statewide success over the last five years.\nSo since 2024, one Georgia has awarded 11 site development infrastructure grants\nto grad sites, that's Georgia Ready for Accelerated Development, to grad sites in Baldwin, Bullock,\nCamden Dodge, Glenn Lawrence, Liberty, Houston Peach, Screven, Tooms and Worth Counties.\nThere are an additional 11 scholarships or smaller planning grants that have been extended\nto other communities that are seeking the Department of Economic Development's grad certification.\nWe anticipate that many of those planning grants will lead to infrastructure funding requests,\nwhich is the objective behind this addition.\nShifting to the FY27 budget document, there are a couple of items beyond the standard enterprise\nadjustments throughout. At line 802 under Departmental Administration is a 2.8 million dollar increase\nto address partial funding for prior year cost of living adjustments. I've heard other agencies\nhighlight the fact that reimbursement of federal funds might take years. As the administrator\nof block grants, there are no additional federal funds to offset DCA's agency cost increases.\nWe are not seeking full funding for the increased agency cost, however we do ask your support\nfor this increase to address the impact on our home ownership program.\nMany of you are familiar with the highly successful Georgia Dream Program.\nThis program, which is funded by Morty Drevenue Bonds, relies on proceeds to finance\ndown payment assistance.\nLast year, Georgia Dream supported a record number of first time home buyers, 3,035, to\nbe precise all across the state.\nAnd a significant portion of the agency's cost of living, cost increases are borne by\nthe housing finance agency with funds that might otherwise be used for down payment\nassistance, which is needed to sustain the increased home ownership production.\nUnder housing initiatives at line 820, this is a simple, this simply reflects the reduction\nof $2 million to the State Housing Trust Fund, which you included in last year's budget\nwith the explicit note that those were one-time funds, and so we are making those one-time\nand also at line 836 under GFA, similarly a $500,000 reduction, which I understand was\nincluded in the 26th budget for a specific project, but also was reflected by this\nbody as one time funds. With that, Mr. Chairman, that concludes my quick\npresentation and I'm happy to entertain questions. Thank you, Commissioner.\nThere's an individual that has their button pressed. She missed the DNR\npresentation and I think they said they would take their building in Taylor\ncounty, but I'll let represent it. I'll have to represent it. Ask a question, maybe.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman, and good afternoon, Commissioner. Thank you for your\npresentation. And he's right. I do have an empty field that's owned by the\nstate in Taylor County that if Department of Corrections,\ncommunity affairs will love you to take it on if you feel that you need some\nadditional space. But also, just to let you know, I wrote a letter of support from\nMacon County for the CHIP grant. So if you see my name come across, I'm\nsupporting Macon County for that endeavor. But you mentioned in your\npresentation that you are the administrator of the block grants. So as\nthe administrator for the block grants, is it required for local governments\nthat are applying for block grants through Department of Community Affairs to\nto have public hearings to notify the public of their intent to apply for a block grant.\nAnd if so, can you explain that process to me?\nSo absolutely.\nAnd I'll kind of tie your question together.\nSo you mentioned a really important program, the CHIP program, community housing initiatives.\nThat's funded with federal block grants.\nSo the state receives that block grant.\nAnd we sub-grant that to communities who are in fact required to do public hearings as\na part of the application process for those competitive funds.\nSo the state is the block grant recipient and those funds are granted to communities.\nI hope you're successful in the application.\nI know that that program is fantastic and it contributes to the construction and rehabilitation\nof homes and communities across the state.\nAnd so yes, the public hearing is a requirement\nfor that process.\nThose are federal grants.\nBut again, there's an available building in Taylor County.\nThank you very much.\nThere's another carpenter.\nThank you.\nAppreciate you being here, sir.\nQuick question.\nFirst question is on the under, I didn't realize this,\nbut under the building construction line item,\nyou guys set building construction codes for the whole state.\nIs there a possibility that we get a group of people\nthat do a lot of building in our communities\nthat complain about certain codes that are excess\nthat are driving the cost of housing up\nto sit on some sort of panel to discuss these things\ninstead of just carte blanche\naccepting international codes.\nYeah, no, that's a fantastic question.\nAnd I honestly would appreciate any of you\nhave questions about this process to come and see me\nbecause I think this is a very misunderstood process.\nSo in fact, you created a process for creating\nstate minimum codes.\nIt's the minimum code.\nAnd that is done by a subcommittee of the DCA board\nthat is made up of 21 defined professions in the law.\nSo it is the HVAC industry,\nit is the electrical industry,\nit is the building officials, it is the fire marshals.\nSo it is 21 qualified professionals,\nincluding home builders, who sit on that panel.\nAnd every six years, so the international codes\ncome out every three years, but so that we are a predictable state in which to do business.\nWe do every six years, we revisit the latest international code and adapt that to Georgia.\nAnd it is that group of professionals from the industries, from communities across the\nstate, local officials are represented by local building officials and by local fire\nmarshals, you know, each of the industries, it's a very thorough process. I don't know\nthat I have ever seen the international codes adopted carte blanche, right? We are always\nworking and cost, you know, is absolutely one of the criteria that they look that they\nlook at as they go through that debate. So I'd love to talk to you more and share with\nyou more about how that process works. But to be clear, that's not a handful of agency\npeople at DCA, defining the same minimum codes, that is a group of industry professionals\nthat were defined by this box.\nSure, maybe even just like a friendly suggestion box or something.\nThe other piece is, of course, on the homelessness piece.\nI heard what you said.\nI just hope that there sometimes it can be a much more cost-efficient to catch it before\nit happens from stretching those dollars.\nSo hopefully as we move through this process we can have that conversation.\nRepresentative Glees.\nThank you, Chairman.\nSo Commissioner Nunn, I was wondering if the Georgia Initiative for Community Housing\nis going to play a part in helping with those homeless dollars in trying to get more\ninventory on the market.\nAnd the reason I asked that, there is a lot of municipal,\nwhat we call barriers to developers actually coming in\nand building out more of what we need.\nAnd so some of that is around just going through the process\nof planning and making sure that their streamlining,\nstreamlining some of those local processes,\nis there a way to put that into the Git program\nor the homelessness program that grant money\nto make sure that developers are not being hamstrung\nin the municipal process for getting, you know,\nfrom the dirt to a key to a door.\nRight, so great question, and short answer is yes and no.\nSo, but thank you for highlighting\nthe Georgia Initiative for Community Housing,\nwhich I think is a fantastic long-term planning program.\nAnd the way that I think that the answer is yes,\nis over the last 20 years,\nwe've had nearly a hundred communities across the state\nthat have participated in the GIC program.\nWorst acronym in state government, right?\nRemember, pay attention when you come up with an acronym\nin your law, because it's just gonna get a job.\nAnd so I think when you look at those communities,\nMany of them, for years going forward,\ncontinue to maintain that team\nto address community housing issues.\nAnd I think in those communities,\nabsolutely, they can play a big part\nin how do we address homeless needs\nin a particular community.\nI think because that program is a planning program,\nso the people who come into the program this year\nare participating in a three-year process\nAnd I don't expect that anyone in this room\nwould consider appropriating funds to an agency\nthat you want us to deploy four years from now.\nAnd so I think that the way that the GIC participants will\nplay a role in addressing these homeless issues\nis that alumni community that is participated in the program\nover the last 20 years, or maybe in the program today.\nThat's exactly the program that's on the other side of the ones we need to be talking to to make sure that they help us with these barriers\nWe we get this every day our developers are telling that we cannot get\nYou know houses on the market because local governments are literally\nCausing us not to be able to get there in an efficient and and financially sound\nmanner so we need help and I think the state can give you know some kind of\nassurance that we're making sure that those who come through the get program have\nthis information and we give them some information to help them streamline the\nprocess. If they're going to get the grants and we're going to get the\nhousing on the market that we need so that we don't deal with homelessness at\nis right. We've got to get everybody in the game and they've got to participate.\nThank you so much.\nRepresentative William.\nThank you, Mr. Chair. Commissioner, I always appreciate working with you. I just\nto stay in homelessness for a second, I appreciate the focus on unsheltered homelessness.\nTo bridge that with what Chairman Carpenter said, we also know that a lot of the issues with that\nis people who are sheltered, at least by the HUD definition, become unsheltered and are not\naccurately captured by the periodic point in time counts. And I'm wondering, and we know a lot\nof local struggle with that, is there any guidance that will be given even some funds directed\nto addressing that? Because I think that bridges the gap between unsheltered and sheltered.\nSo, I will just highlight to you policy makers, you know, we laid out a rough idea of a plan\nthat was included in the governor's budget.\n$50 million is not going to solve all housing issues in the state.\nAnd in conversations with some of the philanthropic partners that we have talked to, focus\nis important. I know, and you remember, we administered a billion dollars in emergency\nrental assistance during COVID, which that's 20 times, this 50 million. And so we are certainly\nopen to that feedback and to tweaking this program, which is simply a concept at this\nstage to address the needs in our communities. I mean, that's really what I meant when I said\nThe intent is a flexible program that meets local needs.\nWe really do believe that the solutions in Rome\nare probably going to look different than they look\ninto COA or in Atlanta.\nYou don't have a question?\nOK, sorry.\nYour light was on, but maybe not.\nMaybe it was Senator Eccles.\nOh, guy, you hit the one mind.\nYou never mind.\nIt's perfectly fine.\nCommissioner, thank you, John.\nAnd two things I want to bring up\nfor just some committee purposes.\nOne, we'd love to know the rules,\nwhat you're looking at for this housing program.\nWe're obviously very lazy of what we saw happen\nin Minnesota, one of kind of have some ideas\nof what our guardrails will be.\nAnd then also, what is the total announced matching funds\nyou think are coming from other agencies\nor other places that will be there?\nIf you know that already, feel free to share\nif you need to bring it later on, that's fine.\nI don't, we would expect that\nas a part of the application process.\nSo, and I think that that probably looks different.\nI just say this because not everybody will be in subcommittee.\nI think that looks very different in a community like our capital city\nthan it would in Tipton.\nThank you.\nThank you so much.\nThank you for the variety of hats you wear.\nOur next and final presenter, we move from none to done.\nDirector Dunn.\nThere you go. Shall we say the best for last?\nProbably. We do have the block hearing grant.\nBlock grant hearings at four, so just so you don't know that.\nAnd even though we're finishing early, please know because of federal law,\nwe will still have to wait until four o'clock to hold that hearing.\nSo we will not be able to accelerate that one.\nI've got an hour of video that explains the budget process at OPP, if you don't mind\nme.\nNo.\nChairman Tillery, Chairman Hatchett, members of the Appropriations Committees, I appreciate\nOnce again, being able to join you this afternoon to wrap up your budget week.\nLast week, the governor released his budget recommendations for AFY 2026 and FY27.\nThis week, you were able to hear directly from the governor on his budgetary priorities.\nOur state economists on the revenue estimate and the state of the economy.\nAnd from our executive and judicial branch leaders on their agency needs and specific\nbudgetary items contained in the governor's recommendation.\nOur task here today is to attempt to summarize and wrap up this testimony before you, before\nyou head into your subcommittee work and putting the stamp of the General Assembly on the\nfinal budget.\nLet me start off with revenue performance.\nWe ended last year FY25 with general revenue up 1.48 billion dollars or 4% higher than\nthe AFLY 25 budget revenue estimate.\nFor the first six months of this fiscal year, general fund revenue is up 1.6 percent\nover the same period last year.\nThis is not great, but these are decent results, especially if you keep in mind that the\nfirst six months of this year includes a 20 basis point lower tax rate in the same period\nlast year.\nThe current FY26 budget passed last year is built upon assumed general fund revenue\nof $35.9 billion, which is 1.3 billion or 3.4% less than FY25 actuals.\nMy point here is that revenue performance today, as well as our previous cautious budgeting,\nwill allow for additional tax reductions in 2026 and allow for expenditure growth in the\nFY26 and FY27 budgets over the current base.\nSo for this year's budget revenue estimates for AFY26, General Fund revenue available\nfor appropriation is set at 2.3% growth or $822 million above the current FY26 base.\nThis is 1.2% less than FY25 actuals.\nIn addition, we are releasing $372 million from the RSR for K-12 adjustments and $3.3 billion\nfrom the undesignated surplus.\nThat makes the total amount of general funds available for expenditure in AFY26 of $40.4\nbillion are an increase of $4.5 billion, that's 12.5% over the FY26 base.\nFor FY27, General Fund revenue forecasted to be up 1.8% or $662 million over the FY26 base.\nThis is 1.6% less than FY25 Actuals.\nThere's no release from the surplus in the base budget, that's a total of $36.8 billion\nof total state General Funds.\nIt's important to note that these projections incorporate the expected fiscal effects of\nthe governor's proposed tax changes announced last week.\nPersonal income tax, and corporate income tax rates for FY26 are assumed to be 20 basis\npoints lower, and for FY27 is assumed to be 30 basis points lower than the FY25 baseline\non a blended rate basis.\nHe heard from the governor at exit issues, the state of the state, as well as his address\nbefore the joint committee about his priorities for the revenue growth being recognized in\nthis budget.\nThe governor's priorities in building this year's budget include, number one, returning\nrevenue to taxpayers, number two, utilizing the midterm budget to make high impact one\ntime investments into infrastructure and economic development.\nFor three, prioritize public safety, particularly in security improvements in our state prisons\nand support for state law enforcement officers.\nAnd finally, number four, fully fund formula and enrollment growth in existing programs,\nfund new legislation passed by this body and signed by the Governor last session,\nand annualize items initially funded in the FY26 budget.\nThis is generally what we usually call work load growth and ensures that our current program\ncommitments are appropriately funded.\nYou will find that the governor's budget recommendations closely align with these priorities.\nJust to briefly review some highlights from the proposed budget, first for taxes.\nThe revenue estimate has built in the return of about $750 million each year on an annualized\nbasis back to taxpayers through lowering the personal and corporate income\ntax rate from 5.19% to 4.99% effective for tax year 2025. If the General Assembly\nsupports this proposal, the state would have reduced its income tax rate by\n76 bips are 13.2% over the last three years. That's $4 billion in income tax\nsavings. Not explicitly in the budget is another round of income tax rebates, which is\nreturning surplus revenue to taxpayers. If approved, this would be the fourth such\nrebate following those approved in 2022, 2023, and 2025. The proposed 2026 rebate represents\nIt's a one-time refund of over $1.17 billion and is equivalent to about 7.2% of personal\nincome tax collected in 2025 being returned to tax payers, 7.2% of personal income tax collected\nin 2025 being returned to tax payers, I'll stop it too.\nIf approved, the checks will be mailed to eligible tax payers directly from the state treasury\nand deducted from the surplus fund balance.\nIn terms of infrastructure and economic development\nin the midterm budget priority, the governor's AFY26 budget\nrecommends over $2.3 billion in general funds\nto accelerate transportation projects,\nincluding the expansion of express lines\non I-75 South of Atlanta.\nThese investments, I want to note,\nare above and beyond growth in the dedicated\nmotor fuel funds that are included in the budget.\nSo these state funds that the governors put in,\nputting in $2.3 billion are above and beyond\nthe motor fuel funds that are in the budget.\nThe governor's budget also includes one-time investments\nin economic development programs in rural communities.\nAs Commissioner Nundis stated,\nthese included $15 million to replenish\nthe one Georgia Rural Site Development Program,\nwhich was established in 2024 to assist rural communities\nto prepare large development-ready sites,\n$35 million to GIFA, the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority,\nto seed a revolving loan program\nfor local governments, development authorities,\nand public utilities to finance the development\nof natural gas infrastructure.\nWhen you pass Senate Bill 13 last year,\nyou recognize that the availability of natural gas\nis often the key driver of industrial recruitment\nand business retention in many communities\nlike the resources to provide upfront financing\nfor these projects.\nThis is an attempt to begin to fix that problem.\nFinally, in the rural economic development bucket,\nthere's almost $14 million to implement recommendations\nof the governor's timber task force,\nincluding almost $10.9 million\nto support the adoption of technology developed at Georgia Tech\nthat utilizes wood scraps for carbon solutions\nin the automotive parts and pharmaceutical industries.\nI also want to mention $33.2 million provided in the governor's capital budget to draw down\nfederal funds for the drinking water and clean water state revolving funds.\nBoth in last year's budget and this year's budget we have included a larger than normal\nstate funds infusion to draw down the increased federal funds made available as part of the\nbipartisan infrastructure law.\nIt's 33.2 million is twice what we generally put in to the state revolving funds as matching funds\nThese funds are critical to local communities for replacing our expanding drinking water and wastewater systems\nreducing lead and drinking water and managing PFAS contamination\nPublic safety you heard about this this morning the governor's budget includes large additions to the Georgia Department of Corrections as well as\nimprovement in the retirement benefits for state law enforcement officers.\nWe worked closely together last year on the GDC budget and we saw historic additions of\nover $650 million to improve staffing ratios, hardened existing facilities, and expand\nbed space.\nThis year's proposed budget for the Georgia Department of Corrections includes over $200\nmillion for capital improvement at existing facilities.\n$55 million annualized for inmate physical health care, mental health services, and dental services,\nand $27 million for $335 new correctional officers to improve the staff to offender ratio.\nThe governor announced at the State of the State a special law enforcement retirement plan\nfor officers currently enrolled in the G-CEPS tier. The new plan is an enhanced employer match\ncontributions to the 401k savings portion of the plan.\nYou know G-Seps is a hybrid plan, it has a pinching component and a 401k\ncomponent. This impacts the 401k or the savings portion of the plan.\nUnder the proposed plan, employer matched to the savings plan of state law\nenforcement officers would increase after five years of service by two\npercentage points each year, capping out at 15% of the salary at year 10.\nTo be eligible for the full state match, employees must continue to contribute 5% of their salary\nto the savings plan.\nI will not go over the math, but the increased contribution plus compounding will result\nin a significantly enhanced benefit at retirement and result in a plan that is among the most\ngenerous among our surrounding states and local jurisdictions.\nThe governor's budget reflects a $5.2 million increase spread across law enforcement agencies\nto help pay for the projected costs of the increase of match.\nLast thing I want to talk about is workload.\nWe have talked about significant tax relief and infrastructure growth investment, infrastructure\nand growth investments in the governor's budget proposal.\nIt's important to emphasize that we are able to make those investments without cutting\nexisting agency programs or budgets to pay for it.\nAddressing formula and workload growth in a state\nthis large is a big lift.\nWhen people ask me, where is the budget growth going to?\nThe answer is most of it goes to workload\nor just maintaining what we are already doing.\nThe AFLY 26 budget contains over $320 million for workload\ngrowth and $1.5 billion for workload growth in the big base budget.\nLet me repeat that.\nThere's an additional $1.5 billion in the FY27 budget just to keep up with the growth\nin our existing programs and funding formulas mandated by law.\nThat's 4% growth in our state general funds budget and that is fairly typical.\nThe largest workload increases, as usually as the case, are in education and health care.\nThe governor's budget includes a $550 million increase in earnings for K-12 education.\n$27.6 million for dual enrollment growth.\n$33 million for TCSG credit-hour growth.\nAnd $219 million for enrollment growth at USG, all in the FY27 budget.\nFor health care and human services, this includes $237 million for Medicaid growth, $23 million\nin increases at DBHCD, and over $65 million in increases at DHS.\nI'll close by mentioning a few other significant proposals in the governor's budget.\nThe governor's FY27 budget proposal recommends a debt package for capital projects.\nYou heard from Diana this morning.\nwe have not issued any debt for the past two years,\ninstead paying for our capital improvements\nwith our balance sheet.\nYou heard directly from the governor\non the benefits of doing so.\nThey're savings of $3.3 billion in interest payments\nover the next 20 years.\nWe have reduced the state's outstanding debt by 20%\nand lowered our debt service to revenue ratio to 3%,\nwhich is significantly less than the constitutional cap\nof 10% and the lowest it's been since the state\nbegin issuing general obligation bonds.\nWe are no longer in a position\nwhen we can fully use cash to fund our routine capital needs.\nHowever, we are returning to the debt market\nwith substantially less debt burden\nand greater flexibility to meet future budget needs.\nAbout $600 million in capital spending\nis funded with cash in the AFY26 budget.\nFor AFY27, the governor's proposed debt package\nis just over $650 million in authorized principle.\nSo bottom line is our debt package is roughly split 50-50\nthis year between debt and cash.\nSecond thing I want to emphasize is the Governor's AFI-20\njust mentioned here a moment ago, the Governor's AFI-26 budget\nproposes $50 million for a grant program\nto local governments and nonprofits\nto address street-level homelessness.\nGrant recipients will be expected to put up local or private funds in order to be eligible.\nAnd though grants may be used for emergency shelter, transitional housing, outreach engagement and wraparound services,\nthe funding is intended as one time with a goal of building community support and involvement\naround high impact interventions to address the homelessness problem in this state.\nThe AFY-26 budget includes a one-time salary supplement of $2,000 for state\nemployees, border regions employees, and teachers to keep our workforce and help\nthem deal with higher inflation.\nThe total cost here is $612 million.\nAnd finally, the AFY-26 budget provides $325 million to the University\nSystem of Georgia Foundation dreams program to provide needs base aid to\nstudents pursuing an associate degree, bachelor's degree,\nor technical degree.\nThe dream scholarship program is an endowment whose earnings\nprovide annual needs-based scholarship funds.\nThe purpose of this appropriation to the endowment\nis to incentivize philanthropic and private donors\nto contribute.\nA reasonable goal for the foundation\nis to have a total of $1.8 billion for the endowment,\nAssuming reasonable returns,\nthat should be generated about $80 million\non average in current dollars each year\nfor needs-based pay.\nChairman Hatchett, Chairman Tillery,\nI will close my remarks there.\nWe have been working on this budget for the last seven months\nand now we're happy to hand it off to you.\nTo that end, I hope this has been helpful\nand I look forward to continuing to work with you,\nyour subcommittee chairs and members of your committees\nas we work our way through the process.\nThank you.\nBut before we have anybody asking any questions,\nwe just want to make sure you know that Representative\nStinson has a building in Taylor County.\nI'll look into OPB South, but you're welcome now.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman, Director Dunn, thank you for all the great work you do for all\nof Georgia.\nI appreciate working with you.\nI have some concerns on the $50 million housing initiative.\nI support the idea, but it's in the amended budget and that's a new program that's\nGotta be rolled out and deployed before\nYou know July 1 that does that give you pause or\nCertainly all those dollars will not likely be allocated prior to July the first\nBut hey, we anticipated be a good case for reserve of those funds if the processes are\nstarted. Mr. Chairman could I ask you to follow up along the same lines? Yes, sir.\nTwo and a half billion in transportation infrastructure. Yes, sir. Certainly I see the need for that.\nIt just seems like that would take a long time to get spent. How will that work? Yes, so for example,\nWell, I-75 is placed in Sirter's budget, which is an authority in that subject to labs for those very reasons.\nBut those funds will be in Comburn, yes sir.\nThank you.\nRepresentative Evans.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nThank you, Director.\nYou were talking about the dream scholarship, which a lot of us are very excited about.\nHopefully, everybody's excited about it.\nBut you mentioned there that that could be used for any degree, including technical.\nAnd I had asked a question the chancellor earlier this week about my concern that those dollars\nwere only listed under the USG budget and there was no mention of them in the TCSG budget.\nSo I wanted to see where I may be missing something, hopefully my concern is misplaced.\nSo the current dreams foundation, the current USG foundations dreams program, both TCSG\nthe USG are eligible, and we're just adding to that.\nSo they will, I'm sorry.\nYes ma'am.\nNow I will also know we included another million dollars\nfor college completion grant explicitly\nfor TCSG students.\nAnd the last thing I'm mentioning here is\nwe've got some pretty good data\non the financial need of USG students.\nWe don't have a lot of good data yet\non the needs gap, if you will, for TCS students,\nonce you consider hope, career grant, things like that.\nBut again, we look forward to understanding more\nabout that need, and again, our expectation\nit would be used for both.\nYeah, and it sounded like from the commissioner\nthat, well, and I know from work over the past years\nthat there definitely is a gap.\nThere's not gonna be a gap for everybody,\nbut there's still a gap for a lot.\nAnd on average, you go and plug five students out of US,\nG-Institution, you go plug five out of a TCSD,\nmore than likely the students that you plug out of TCSG are going to be in those households\nunder $40,000 or $50,000 a year. So certainly we have the need. But I just want to make\nclear so it doesn't matter that that money is listed just in the USG budget. TCSG students\nwould still be eligible. That's correct. We expect the dreams program to continue to operate\nas structured and as currently structured TCSG students are eligible.\nAnd what about the students at the the private colleges?\nwould not be included. Okay. They're not eligible now and that's correct. Okay. Thank you.\nDirector Dunn. Awesome. You must have done a great presentation. I like being last.\nThank you. Look forward to working with you. Yeah. Members, just reminder that all the\npresentations that were made our own line under the House Budget Office tab on the legislative\nsite. There are committee subcommittee meetings tomorrow and there are subcommittee meetings scheduled\nfor Tuesday. If there are any changes there like everything just keep you informed and look out\nfor notices from the speaker and from the Lieutenant Governor's offices on attendance and\nthose issues but and also these are house subcommittee meetings senate members are invited to attend so they can learn as much as they want.\nMr. Chair.\nIs that sort of would that be considered dual enrollment, Mr. Chair? I'm trying to figure that out.\nThank you all members for being here this past three days.\nYou put a lot of hours, a lot of time in this, as you know, there have been over 40 presentations so far.\nSome things to remember, we are on a timeline.\nAnd while the weather interrupts that timeline, it does not slow it down.\nSo please keep a watch of your emails.\nAlso, you've got the Governor's budget book to roll through.\nYou know the subcommittees that you're on already.\nexpect that we will have to start rolling those very, very soon in order to keep up with the timeline that has been laid out by the full calendar.\nThank you so much for your attendance, for your participation and Chairman Hatchett, you get the last word.\nWe're adjourned.\n",
