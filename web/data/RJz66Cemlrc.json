All members voted if so, the clerk will lock the machines. Doorkeepers, will you please close the doors and keep them closed? Because this is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 121st House District. The representative Marcus Wiedhauer. Colleagues, I come before you this morning heavy-hearted, but I do have the distinct honor to introduce my friend, Joel Shimpo. Joel graduated from the University of Georgia before attending Liberty University, where he earned his masters in religion and masters in divinity. He began his career at first Baptist Snellville and then spent nearly 16 years at Watkinsville Baptist Church. But recently God called on him to reach out to a new community and last year announced the launch in just this month, launch five points church where he is the lead pastor. As I prepared for today, I decided to check out the five points church website. I clicked through various topics, topics covered on the page, and I came to one that said family. Knowing the history of their family, I was immediately curious. The first line read, God has ordained the family as the foundational institution of human society. It is composed of persons related to one another by marriage, blood, or adoption. See Joel and his wife Jennifer live this statement. Together they have been a force for foster care reform and support. They have fostered and adopted two of their five children from the foster care system. My personal passion for foster care is ignited by Joel and Jennifer. I will be forever grateful for their godly love of these children and their spiritual leadership Joel has brought our community. Please welcome Joel Shimpo, my friend lead pastor, five points church. It is my honor to be here with you today. My condolences to members of the house. The Psalm 34 says that the Lord is near to the broken hearted and saves those who were crushed in spirit. So be assured that the Lord is near you today. On this difficult day, I would like to take you back to a difficult day that I had in my life eight years ago. It seemed like it was an ordinary Saturday. Well, in the sense of ordinary for our family, at that time we had a pretty chaotic ordinary, a household of four children aged four and under. Yeah, you heard that right. Four children aged four and under. And life was loud and crazy at our house. But otherwise that day was ordinary. My wife was overdue for a break from the house. She left that morning for a therapy. I mean a hair appointment. No worries, my love. I assured her confident in my ability to manage all four children who constantly were on the move and constantly looking for food. She left that morning. There's five of us there in the living room. I found a little respite on the couch just to be disrupted by our little one-year-old redhead Caroline who delighted and crawling all over me whenever I did find comfort. And a spot to rest. Then in a second, everything changed. Little Caroline convulsed, fell silent. Her breath ceased and her skin turned alarming shade of blue. I scooped her up into my arms. I was frantic to discern the cause while at the same time instructing our four-year-old to urgently seek help from our neighbor while I dialed 911. Paramedics arrived with astonishing swiftness. And as they walked in, Caroline still laid in my arms completely lifeless. They started work immediately and soon we were in route to the hospital. That day upended our life for a while. But it has a happy ending. Sweet Caroline survived thanks to the skilled intervention of the medical professionals and astute diagnosis. And a critical blood transfusion. Today she's an incredible, vivacious, beautiful, nine-year-old and I think God that he protected her. But there's one part of the narrative that I left out and you might have been clued into already with the introduction. At that time, Caroline was not my child. Caroline had been placed in our home as a child and foster care. And what this traumatic event brought out for me was just how much I loved this little girl. It did not matter that she was not my child. I loved her. And in those moments of her sickness, those harrowing days, I knew in my soul I would do anything to protect her and take care of her. And I was able to improve, became well again, and a few years later, in a moment of both grief and a menstrual as adoptive parents know, Caroline became a permanent member of our Shimpo household. And I'm now the proud daddy of this beautiful girl. I share this story this morning, not to convey just the love that I have for my children, not just the love I have for my daughter, this daughter who was not my daughter at that time. But I share this story to point you to an even greater love, a love by a heavenly father. It was this experience and all the moments that led to the adoption that helped me grasp just how much the creator God loves us. In Galatians 4, we read these words, when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons. And because you are sons, God has sent the spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, oba father, so you are no longer a slave by the Son. And if a son, then you are an heir with God. As an adoptive parent, those words resonate deeply. With five children now, two of which are adopted, including Caroline, the love I feel for them is immeasurable. Yet as a parent, and as an adoptive parent, I understand the significant cost, both financial, emotional, physical, involved in bringing children into our family. And reflecting on those sacrifices, I recognize that God sacrificed to welcome us into His family, far surpasses any sacrifice we've ever made. For God to welcome us into His family, it meant the death of His Son. His love was so great and so boundless that He sent His Son to endure the punishment we deserve for the sins that we had committed, offer the sake to bring us into His family. To make us sons and daughters. You too can become a part of God's family, a cherished child through belief, and I sincerely hope you will, because there's nothing more profound than knowing the love of a heavenly father. Let us bow our heads in prayer. Gracious Heavenly Father, it's in moments like these today that we understand that life is very short. And the difference between a moment here and a moment there is quite significant more than we could imagine. And so we call on you, the Creator of all things, to help us, and to speak to us, and for us to truly know you. I thank you for this opportunity to share of your love this morning, and I pray all these in this chamber would know your love. And especially, would fill your comfort today and your nearness. We thank you Jesus for bringing us into your family for those who believe. And it's in your name we pray these things. Amen. And by you to join me in the Pledge of Allegiance. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic of what you stand, one nation is under the number of individuals who are the labor of justice for all. You can just come right here just for a moment. Brother Sam, thank you for that message. Good luck with that new church. And Jennifer, thank you for what you, the care that you have for the children of our staff, and for your own children. And we appreciate both of you what you did, what you're doing, and what you've done. And we look forward to work with you on foster care. Doorkeepers, you can unlock the doors, members. You can meet the chaplain in the south any room and have a photo and greet them and welcome them to the house. You members, our doctor of the day is brought to us upon the request of Representative Roger Bruce. Our doctor of the day is Dr. Cassandra Barnett Donnelly. You can find her down in the aid station if you so need, but we appreciate her being here and providing this great service to the members. Members, here is our posture. I'll go ahead and let you know this. If you have your attention, we will proceed with the regular business of this day. We've had discussion with those who wanted to present morning orders. They will be put off until tomorrow. We're going to have a special time for the Columbus delegation to come up doing morning orders time. We'll take up a couple of bills and then we'll postpone several of them until tomorrow. That'll be the order of our business for the day. So I appreciate you working with us and understanding as we all deal with the loss of Chairman Smith. Chair recognizes Chairman Tarvan, the Chair of the Committee on Information and Odits. Chairman Tarvan. Mr. Speaker, your Committee on Information and Odits has read the journal from the previous legislative day and found it to be correct. Mr. Speaker, if you'll indulge me, I will say as I said at home last night and heard the news of the weekend, the off for killing the 1080, then the Department of Defense comes out that we had lost three Georgians. And this morning is especially tragic, saddening day for me. I'm going to continue with what I had planned. Our flag does not fly because of the wind that lifts it. It flies with the last breath of each soldier who died protecting it. Amen, Mr. Chairman, so true. So true. We'll recognize that even more tomorrow is wind bites and special guests to this chamber. We owe a deep debt of gratitude to those who protect us.

And you better go tell him something good because if not, he was going in a trash. But that's what made this state even better, y'all. Thank you each and every one of you. I'll love you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My colleagues in the house, Columbus has lost a giant of a man in the loss of Richard Smith. We were all satan and heartbroken to hear of his passing. But when I think of Richard, I think about the fact that a friend never really dies. As long as you keep their memory alive. I want you to know that our delegation is going to continue and work in the honor and the manner that Richard has set out for us. He will always be remembered by the citizens of Columbus because not only was he a county agent, but when called on to serve, he stepped in to be our city manager. And then when called on to serve, he came to this capital to represent the citizens of Columbus as a state representative. So he always kept the citizens of Columbus before him. And lastly, I'm going to just share what my dad says. My dad says you can judge a man by the way he treats his family. And by that measurement, Richard was a giant because he loved his wife, he loved his family, he loved his community, and he loved all of us as his family as well. Well, I asked a young one of the group here, newest member to this delegation. I was kind of rough this morning. This is my second session of my first term. And unfortunately in both sessions, I have experienced the death of a colleague. Richard was very close to me. Richard was the type I could always go bend a knee by his desk and ask him a question. He would be patient. He would work with me. And even one time he told me, one man, you're a young man, you're learning pretty fast. So I said, here to serve the people of Columbus. When we used the word delegation in Columbus, we sincerely mean it. We're truly fighting together for the people of Southwest Jordan and Columbus, Georgia. That was important to him and it's important to all of us. This past Friday, as many of you know, that Hearst Ambulance Tag Beal came through. And I asked the gentleman representative C. Barby would yield for a question. And my question was in regards to how did he get that tag deal through rules. Mr. Speaker, you and I both was looking for that answer, but apparently representative Misha Mayner received that answer. She shared it with me this morning. And she said, Richard leaned over to her and said, well, that be all God do because if I gotta go out in the ambulance, I don't want it to say Hearst. But when I do have to go out in the Hearst, I wanted to mean that. My friend went out and styled. We need to make sure even if we manufacture tag, that tag needs to only say Hearst for him. We need to make sure that happens. I want to wrap up with a quick quote from the gentleman I had the representative, the pleasure of replacing and currently services representative, that's representative Calvin Smirie. He said, this time words can't adequately express my pain and sadness this morning when I learned of the passing of my dear friend, Chairman, Richard Smith. He was a steady hand and trusted colleague for me over many years. We shared a great friendship. My prayers and thoughts are with Claire and the entire Smith family. He will be dearly missed in the Columbus community, the General Assembly and the State of Georgia. Representative Smirie, I echo those words. Thank you. We've already said that Richard served as a county extension agent in Columbus. Richard and I had a relationship where we teased each other, sometimes unmercifully, but I would tease him about being a urban or city county agent. And did that mean he wasn't good enough to be one in the counties or the country? And so he got me back because for years we sat next to each other, what was known as the Columbus Road for many years. And we were at home in a town forum and he said, you know, I have to sit by her. And I try real hard to keep her straight, but it's just impossible. And as the years have gone on, he's moved up into bigger and better and higher ranking chairs. But he continued to tease and he continued to be a friend and he was a huge advocate for Columbus and taking care of it. He was my mom and dad's city councilman. He was my mom and dad's state representative. And when he rode by their house and there were too many cars in the driveway, he would call and he'd say, you mom and dad are right. He could act gruff and almost scary at times to prove a point, to share his feelings, but underneath, he was a really good man. His family at home needs our thoughts and prayers. But he also thought of all of us as family too. And he would want us to be prayerfully, remembering each other. Not just for his loss, but how to move forward and carry a piece of him with him to keep doing good. And he'd want us to remember people like Pamela Lewis in his office and all of the staff that he works with. Because he was not someone that forgot what a lot of people refer to as the little people. He was good at remembering everybody. I'll miss him picking on me. I'll miss him for lots of reasons. But I am so grateful that he's been in my life. And I am so grateful that Georgia had him as a representative and as a rules chair and as a friend. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We yield well. Thank you, Columbus delegation. Y'all worked very well together. And that fifth member of the delegation will be sorely missed by Saul. But not forgotten. Thank you members. As Chairman Smith would have wanted us to do, we'll move on with our business of the day. And we had a very special invite resolution that was going to be presented today. And it will be presented today. So if Florida Wade will come up and bring your guests with you, we will ask the clerk in just a moment. Ladies. Trophy. Members of your give. I will guess your attention. I will ask the clerk to read the caption to a resolution. House resolution 892 by Rosewood of Wade and the ninth dupe nick of the 29th Cox, the 28th, bear to the 24th, McDonald, 26th and others. A resolution. Congratulations, a University of Georgia women's softball team for winning the 2023 NCAA championship. Mr. Clerk, just clarity, when you read the university, what did you say? University of North Georgia women's softball team. I just wanted to make sure there's a little bit of difference there. One's much better institution than another, right? I already got it. So with that, thank you, Mr. Clerk. Then we will recognize representative, we'll wait to speak to the resolution. Thank you, sir. Thank you, speaker and thank you, colleagues. And on this somber day, I can't help but think of our friend, Richard Smith. If I came up with one word to describe him, I would actually describe him as a person that's just excellence. And what better way to showcase excellence than when folks in this state achieve a great feat of excellence. And that is what my alma mater University of North Georgia brings, and that's excellence to the state. And this team that is here today, we have three of the seniors that have gone on to graduate that are here today. And I'm excited that you'll get to hear briefly from the president and I believe one of the players is going to speak briefly. But this is an awesome opportunity to showcase that the University of North Georgia brought home the Division 2 national championship for college fast pitch softball. And these are amazing students, amazing athletes, and they're all gainfully employed, providing for their communities and carrying on the excellence that is being a University of North Georgia graduate. I'm honored to be here and welcome President Shannon to briefly. Thank you, sir. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I bring you greetings from our nearly 18,000 students.

But if you allow me to make one more mention, Mr. Leader, Leader Beverly, I'm going to give you a few more questions. You're fine, Chairman Perkel. I wanted to let you know and acknowledge that Senator Warnault's was here this morning and we had a meeting schedule. Certainly he understands and tell him how much I appreciate him allowing us to reschedule. I will reschedule it at a time in place that suits him. I want to sit down with him and have a great conversation. We appreciate him being here at the Capitol today. And certainly, and explaining to him what his situation is, if you will. Thank you so much, Mr. Leader. I hope you had a good meeting with him this morning as well. Thank you. Chairman Yard, are you ready to go? We were going to take a here she is. You'll be next, Chairman Yard. Mr. Clerk, are you ready with HB884? House Bill 884, our representative Alexander, the 66 Bruce, the 64th and others, to be entitled back to amend Code Section 1562 of the Fish Code of Georgia. I annotated really the number of judges and superior courts those who provide for a fourth judge of the superior courts of Douglas and Judicial Circuit. Ms. Bill Lambert, for the Committee on Judiciary, that committee recommends that this bill do pass by Committee substitute. Chair, recognize the representative Alexander to present the bill. Representative? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. HB884 is legislation to add a fourth judge of the superior courts of Douglas Judicial Circuit. The reasons for this legislation are this legislation was requested on behalf of the Chief Judge of Douglas County. Douglas County ranks number three for new judgeship. Currently, three judges are doing the workload of 4.5 judges for the past several years. Douglas County have not added a superior court judge since 1998. Also, the governor has included this fourth judge in the budget. The verbites in the language mirrors other judgeships previously passed in the body. I want to talk specifically about Section 3 line 22 through 30. The verbites staggers the term in a last election in 2026. We have two judges currently on the ballot this year, and the third judge will be added with the third judge in 2026. And wrapping up Chief Judge McClain retires at the end of the year, and we thank him for his services to Douglas County. Mr. Speaker, that is the bill, and I will pause for any questions. The lady did an outstanding job. She has no questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ask for your favorable consideration of House Bill 884, and I will yield the well. May get you to present a lot of bills to this group, if it goes like that. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee's substitute? Chair, here's none. The Committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. The report of the Committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass, all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? I have all members voted. For what purpose is Chairman Collins rise? Parliamentary inquiry? State inquiry. For what purpose is Chairman Collins rise? Parliamentary inquiry? State inquiry. Is it not true that Representative stated that Judge Bo McLean would be retiring at the end of this year? Yes, the gentleman says so. Is it not true that Judge Bo McLean is probably one of the best men that I've ever had the privilege of knowing and that I represented that to area for a short while when I first came to this house. And we're going to miss Judge McLean being on the bench there in Douglas County. Sounds like with your relationship and your knowledge of Judge McLean in his service, he will be greatly missed. Hope he will certainly consider coming back as a senior judge status and continue to serve the great people of our state. Have all members voted? If so, the Clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill. The A's were and R 168, the NA's or zero, the bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. My comments probably led to that applause you did do a good job. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to HB 906906? House Bill 906 by a repson of year to the 150 second, housed in the 170th, Berkel 169th. To be entitled an act to men code section 1562, with the fiscal to Georgia annotated, relating the number of judges this period court, so as to provide for a third judge with the spirit courts in the Tifton Judicial Circuit. I would refer to the committee on judiciary that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chairman Yerda is recognized to present the bill. Chairman Yerda. Speaker, the colleagues I'm bringing you, House Bill 906. House Bill 906 would provide for a third judge of the spirit courts of the Tifton Judicial Circuit. Four counties make up the circuit, Erwin Tift Turner and Worth County. The judge workload is 1.41, which is the highest workload by a requesting circuits. The Tifton Judicial Circuit last received a new judgeship 43 years ago in 1980. At that, since that time, the circuit is grown by a population of 25%. In 2023, Superior Court judges spent an average of 16 working days in court, and they're currently scheduled to spend that same amount of time in 24. There are five accountability courts in the district or the circuit. Currently, there are 31 murders pending in the circuit and 94 serious violence felony spending. They also have 2951 open felony cases on top of that of the serious murder and serious violent felony cases. The Judicial Council met this summer to address the critical need for additional Superior Court judges, and the Tifton Judicial Circuit was ranked number one in that evaluation. So I ask for your favor consideration on adding a third judge to the Tifton Judicial Circuit. You have no questions. I yield the well, Mr. Speaker. You do the marvelous job as well. Sounds like you have a need down there. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there an objection to adopting the committee substitute? Chair, here's none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any agreement? Any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Are you voting a speaking? I think you're voting, right? Have all members voted? All members voted.\n\nIf so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine on the passage of the bill, HB 906, the Yades are 168, the Nays are zero. The bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. We have several other bills on our rules calendar today, but we will postpone those bills until tomorrow. There are House Bill 878, House Bill 905, House Bill 976, and House Bill 985. Postponed to the next legislative day. I appreciate y'all working with us. There are several important afternoon orders, and we will postpone them as well, so I appreciate y'all willing to work with this on this day. That is important to us all. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to a group of privileged resolutions honoring the life and memory of Nora Wood Goodman? Recognizing commending Georgia Military College, recognizing commending the Georgia Academy of Audiology, naming April 1-7, 2024's Global Minority Entrepreneurs Week, recognizing commending Carol Crawford, recognizing the week of February 5-9-2024 as National School Counseling Week, and for other purposes that completes the reading with privileged resolutions.
