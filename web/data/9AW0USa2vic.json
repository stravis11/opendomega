representative Anderson\nthank you Mr Speaker\nit's an honor this morning to represent\nmy friend\nand to introduce my friend Dr John\nYarborough\nto this house\nyou know how do you introduce a man who\nhas so many accolades it's impressive\nthat he's a graduate of true McConnell\nUniversity Mercer University the\nSouthern Baptist Theological Seminary\nand holds a Doctrine Divinity from\nSouthern California Theological Seminary\nit's important that he's pastored many\nchurches he's\ncurrently or he has served as the vice\npresident of the North American Mission\nboard for the Southern Baptist\nconvention and he's currently the a\ndirector and Adjunct professor professor\nfor Truitt McConnell University\nit's impactful\nthat he was one of 60 spiritual leaders\ninvited by President George W bush\nfollowing the 9 11 attack\nto discuss the spiritual impact of that\nterrorist attack on our nation\nit's probably most impressive\nthat he's been married to his beautiful\nwife Diana\nfor 54 years they have two children and\nfour grandchildren\nbut none of those things are the most\nimportant thing that I can say about Dr\nJohn Yarborough the most important thing\nthat I can say and with this I'll\nintroduce you to Dr John Yarbrough is\nthat he is a man after God's Own Heart\nDr Arbor\nwelcome sir\nthank you representative Anderson and\nthank you speaker\nit is an honor to stand before this\nAugust body of\nwho's whose\nfor each of you are a who's who in the\ndistrict that has elected you to sit in\nthe seat that you sit in\nand given you that responsibility\nand I don't know about you but every\ntime I walk into this building\nI'm so impressed as I walk through the\ngallery and I\nsee the\nportraits of the who's who's\nthat have affected our nation and our\nstate\nand then when we get to some of the more\nmodern ones the ones that I've had the\nprivilege to know and be impacted by\nI feel like I'm not a who's who but I'm\na who's he\nI've been the bathroom break on major\nconferences all over the world\nwhen you've got Charles Stanley\nand David Jeremiah\nand John Yarbrough when are you going to\ngo to the bathroom\nbut you know what as I look in the Bible\nwhile I see the gallery of the who's who\nthe Moses the Abrahams\nthe David you remember David was a who's\nhe\ntill he faced Goliath\nand became a who's who\nand then John\nand Peter\nand Paul who you remember he was a who's\nwho\nwith the religious leaders in Israel\nuntil he had an encounter with Jesus on\nthe way to Damascus\nand he became a who's he to them\nbut a who's who to the early church and\nended up writing half of our new\ntestament\nI want to take you just for a moment\nbecause I've become intrigued with as a\nwho's he\nhe's in the Bible\nand I'm just going to lift up two very\nquickly\nvery quickly this morning\none is in Judges chapter 3 verse 31.\nthis is the only verse he has in the\nBible but by the way he does have a\nverse in the Bible\nand it says this\nand after him came shemgar\nthe son of Athen\nwho struck down 600 Philistines with an\nox goad\nand he saved Israel\nnow I'd say probably over 2500 years ago\nhe was a who's who he was the third\njudge\nruling over the nation of Israel before\nthey had a king\nbut he was willing to do what he could\nwith what he had where he was while he\nwas there\nmy prayer is that God would raise up\nAmong Us\na legion of shimgars to do what we can\nwith what we've got where we are while\nwe're here\nbecause you see that Arts gold I'm not\nmuch of an agricultural expert\nbut I had to research a little bit what\nwas he holding it wasn't an instrument\nof War it was an instrument that you\nwould use to Pride The Oxen with\nand then on the other end it had a flat\nplace where you would scrape the mud off\nthe plow\nand yet\nhe took what he had and used it to do\nwhat he could and he saved Israel\nand it's time\nbut then the second guy and this is the\nonly other guy I'll cover with you today\nit's your mom\nand Shema was one of David's three\nMighty Men\nand it says in\nsecond Samuel the third chapter\nnow after him was Shema the son of A.G\nthe hairite and the Philistines were\ngathered into a troop where there was a\nplot of ground full of lentils and as a\nGeorgia Boy\nhe was standing in a pee patch\nand the people fled from the Philistines\neverybody ran but Shema\nbut he took his stand in the midst of\nthe plot defended it and struck down the\nPhilistines and the Lord brought about a\ngreat victory\nI want you to just real quickly when he\nstood where he stood and why he stood\nwhen he stood at the moment of crisis\nwhen somebody needed to do something\neverybody else was running but he stood\nwhere he stood\nin the middle of the P patch\nin the midst it says everybody could see\nhim you guys there's some things worth\nstanding for amen\nand sometimes you have to stand alone\nif nobody's willing to stand with you\nyou need to stand alone\nbut I want you to understand he wasn't\nalone\nbecause why he stood it was God's P\npatch\nand it said and the lord gave the\nvictory\nnow when you're standing if you're\nstanding with the Lord\nyou're never alone\nand you make a majority\nwhen it's you and him\nlet's pray together\nfather God I pray for these men and\nwomen and the awesome responsibilities\nyou've given them\nI know that this week they have\nlong days in front of them\nand major decisions\nI pray that you will grant them wisdom\nI pray that you will grant them courage\nI will pray that you grant them the\nability to stand in the midst\non issues we're standing for to protect\nand defend this state\nand father as we pray as we've already\nmentioned we pray for those who deal\nwith disaster\nfor those families that are grieving the\nloss of loved ones\nfor those who are having to rebuild\ntheir lives their homes their businesses\nwe pray for First Responders\nwe pray for civic and Community leaders\nas they stand together to rebuild\nwherever the storms were\nwe know father that you are there\nin the midst\nand will one day bring the victory\nforgive us father\nforgive us when we\nspend so much on so little\nhelp us to be what you want us to be and\ndo what you desire us to do in Jesus\nname amen\npledge the flag with me if you will to\nour nation\nI pledge allegiance to the flag of the\nUnited States of America and to the\nRepublic for which it stands one nation\nunder God indivisible with liberty and\njustice for all amen

significant group from\nEffingham County here today uh welcome\nto the people's house I'd like to ask\nyou to stand the mayor of Rincon\ncouncilman the chief of police our\nEffingham Heroes organization and most\nimportantly the Gallagher family\nand the reason the primary reason we're\nhere today is uh\nback last June just before the Fourth of\nJuly in Rincon we have what's known as a\nFourth of July parade but we call it\nfreedom rings\nand uh on during that parade I happened\nto be the Grand Marshal and I was\nsitting in the cat bird seat\nthe chief of police led the parade the\nsheriff was second and I was third and\nas we were in the parade all of a sudden\nI saw a car coming in the opposite\ndirection where all traffic had been\nshut off\nat first I thought it was somebody who\nwas just lost and made a wrong turn who\ncame in and uh but as he approached the\nparade he didn't slow down he continued\non the chief of police swerved and tried\nto block him and he went around the\nchief the sheriff moved over and tried\nto block him and he went right by me\nI will give my friends in the third\ninfantry division credit the third\ninfantry division band was right behind\nme\ninstruments and all of them went into\nthe ditch pretty rapidly as if they were\nin a combat situation\nbut the individual continued on at high\nspeed there were children out there\nchildren's dance groups it was a pretty\nsignificant sized parade so they called\nahead and they had a fire truck try and\nblock the parade he turned sideways and\nthey went around the fire truck\nand as he continued on\nK-9 Officer Gallagher who's pictured in\nthe picture there on the right that's\nthe chief\nofficer Gallagher and his canine razor\nhe saw him coming he lined up with him\nand in order to stop him and save life\nand property he uh he hit him head on it\ntotaled out his SUV he was hospitalized\nthe officer was hospitalized and as I\nunderstand that Razer just had to\nundergo surgery here recently for the\ndamages that were inflicted upon him so\nwe wanted\nofficer Gallagher if you raise your hand\nso we could recognize you for your Valor\nand\n[Applause]\n[Applause]\nin all honesty we wanted to do a house\nresolution but we got the information\ntoo late and the dates were full so but\nwelcome to the people's house and thank\nyou for everything you do for our\ncitizens in Effingham County\nwe thank you for those heroic actions\nyou saved lives thank you so much and\nwhat you do every day for the people not\nonly of Rincon but for our entire State\nwe appreciate you\nrepresentative Danny Mathis\nis recognized for a morning order\nthank you Mr speaker thank you members\nof the house today I come to you and I\nhave a resolution that I want to read to\nyou we have a crisis going on in this\ncountry in this state and our local\ncommunities it's a fentanyl crisis\nand we've written this resolution it\nsays whereas the fentanyl epidemic is\none of the biggest threats facing the\ncitizens of Georgia and whereas\naccording to the CDC\n107\n375 people in the United States died of\ndrug overdoses and Drug poisons in the\n12-month period ending in January of\n2022 and 67 percent of those deaths\ninvolve synthetic opioids like Fentanyl\nand whereas from 2019 to 2021 fentanyl\noverdoses deaths increased by\n232 percent in Georgia alone\namongst age 10 to 19 fentanyl is\nresponsible for a staggering 800 percent\nincrease in overdose deaths during the\nsame time period\nand whereas fentanyl is being found not\nonly by itself but also illegal drugs\nsuch as methamphetamine heroin and\ncocaine often causing unaware buyers to\ningest what they believe to be\nmethamphetamine Heron or cocaine but\ninstead get almost pure Fentanyl with\nfatal results and whereas the drugs sold\nby the criminal street gangs often\nsupplied by mexican-based cartels\nare some of the methods for how fentanyl\nis finding its way to Georgia\nfentanyl is also being smuggled through\nlegal ports hidden amongst cargo\nand whereas this rise in fentanyl in\nGeorgia puts law enforcement tasks with\nstopping these drugs as well as First\nResponders trying to save lives at risk\nfentanyl exposure to law enforcement\nofficials is on the rise and puts their\nlives in danger\nfrom receiving an accidental overdose as\nwell\ndeployment of Knox common commonly\nreferred to as Narcan provides temporary\ntemporary protection\nand opioid overdose can turn fatal in as\nlittle as six minutes\nbut next lawn can reverse it almost\ninstantly\nnow therefore be it resolved by the\nHouse of Representatives that the\nmembers of this body strongly support\nthe work being done by law enforcement\nagencies\nacross Georgia as well as their Federal\nPartners to combat this crisis\nMr Speaker I'd like to thank you for\nyour concern and your help with this\nMajority Leader Chuck abstration thank\nyou for your help majority

stories weren't\nrecorded for the for the future but when\nElliot was elected and him being a\nRhodes scholar they were having a\nmeeting\ntrying to decide where they were going\nto place committee members at that time\nand then one of them speaker Murphy or\nsomeone of them said something to Harry\nabout well he's a Rhodes scholar and\nHarris said well he'd be perfect to be\non the transportation committee since he\nknows so much about Rhodes\nso that ladies and gentlemen is a little\nbrief story about The Honorable Elliott\nlevitis and a man of true character\nwho one of the

the\n49th and others to be titled an act to\namend article 7 of chapter 4 title 49 to\nthe official code of Georgia annotated\nrelating to medical assistance generally\nso it's required the Department

that\nthis bill do pass\nby committee substitute\ncheer Lily chair lady Ballinger is\nrecognized to present the bill\ny Bellinger\nthank you Mr Speaker it's my pleasure to\npresent before you Senate bill 9.\nthe first part of Senate Bill 9 has to\ndo with white bagging and white bagging\nkind of sounds a little bit nefarious to\nme\num but it really just has to do with\ninsurance companies trying to get in\nbetween providers and their patients\nwhenever you're a cancer patient and you\nshow up to get your infusion or perhaps\nyou're an MS patient there are lots of\nconditions that are covered under this\nyou go you get weighed your blood\nchemistry is taken in your\num your dosage is mixed up according to\nyour blood chemistry and your weight\nyou know the particular cocktail is is\nmixed up right then and there and so the\ninsurance companies want to interfere\nwith this and make you have your uh\nprescriptions maybe a day maybe several\ndays in front of your actual infusion\ndate so this can cause all sorts of\nproblems for the patient so this would\nbase basically prohibit that\nthe second section of House Bill 109\nallows DCH to cover continuous glucose\nmonitors the patient must be diabetic\nand it requires training and the patient\nmust use daily insulin and it must have\na an appointment with their provider in\nperson or via Telehealth every six\nmonths to check on the efficacy of the\ncontinuous glucose monitors and make\nsure that they're working as they should\nMr Speaker that's the uh that's all I\nhave to say about Senate Bill 109 and\nI'll be happy to yield to any questions\nyou have no questions\nMr Speaker and I urge your favorite book\nyou do have a question okay to your left\nrepresentative Lisa Campbell has a\nquestion\nthank you Mr Speaker does the

close\nattention and care\nin the moment during her chemotherapy\ntreatments yes that is that is typical\nof many of our cancer patients here in\nthe state of Georgia and we're just\ntrying to

infrastructure Innovation that\ncommittee recommends that this bill do\npass by rules committee substitute\nchairman of Transportation chairman\nJasper is recognized to present the bill\nwell thank you Mr thank you Mr Speaker\ncommittee members I mean committee\nmembers house members we've seen this\nbefore this is almost the same bill that\nI brought before you a few weeks ago on\nthe work of The Joint Commission on the\nelectrification of Transportation the\nbill does three things you know it\nallows the sale of Power by retail by\nothers than Georgia power and the EMC\nallows the regulation of electric\nvehicle charging stations throughout the\nstate and the taxation on the sale of\nelectricity we've made a few changes\nbetween here and there the main one\nbeing the rate and if you look on page\nif you were so inclined page 14 line 334\nyou see a number going from 9 to 11. and\nso that works inversely that decreases\nthe rate that we had put in earlier the\nrate for the cell of electricity the\nexcise tax will be\n2.84 cents per kilowatt hour instead of\nif it were 9 3.47\nI appreciate everyone's work\nespecially on this I'll cross the aisle\nand everywhere getting this through with\nthe center Gooch and the centers and all\nthe different committees that has a\ntouch on this bill the main thing it\ndoes is it really makes sure that we\ncontinue funding Transportation\ninfrastructure that's the roads and\nbridges across our state if you listen\nto us and transportation talk very often\nthat's the key thing that we've got to\nwork on it's something we have to work\non in the future especially with Freight\nLogistics funding I look forward to\nworking on that Mr Speaker that's my\nbill I'll be glad to answer any\nquestions\nyou do have a couple of questions to\nyour left representative Al Williams is\nrecognized for our question\nthank you Mr Speaker will the gentleman\nyield yes sir the clarification\nthere is a charging station at the\nDublin exit that's the only one I know\nbetween my house and Atlanta yes can you\ntell me what the breakdown the cost now\nwhat did it cost to charge an average\ncar and what will it be after this bill\npasses I don't know the dollar amount Mr\nWilliams but what it will do is now\nyou're purchasing electricity based on\ntime after this bill is signed you'll be\npaid the effective date you'll purchase\nit on the kilowatt hours sold to you so\nit will be a change but it should be\nsimilar but uh you're going to get\nyou're going to buy what you pay for you\ncan pay for what you can get what you\npay for excuse me will you yield four\ndollars oh yeah are you aware do you\nknow if chairman Hatchet owns an\ninterest in that one at the Dublin exit\nI didn't know that\nyou saw me stand up but if he did I\nthink it'd be even more for it I'm sure\nchairman yield yes sir\nanother member of the Williams caucus\nrepresenting Mary Frances Williams to\nyour left has a question\nchairman my question is this\num I think one version of this bill\nprohibited uh free charging and I know a\nlot of establishments offer free\ncharging is is that is this bill going\nto to do that yes ma'am well no it won't\nbecause if you want to do free charging\nthat's up to you as a business person\nlike you could give away Coca-Cola if\nyou wanted to to increase your business\nbut the sale of power through that\nmachine through that EB charger will be\nexcise tax and sales tax as it should be\nit's up to them to give it away if they\nchoose to\nfurther further questions sure\num so so you're saying that someone will\nhave to pay for that electricity at that\nquote unquote free pump yes ma'am I am\nand and one more question\num are you\ndo you know for certain because I that\nthese these pumps that have been stopped\ninstalled all over the state at you know\nI don't know uh publics and other places\nare they capable of monitoring uh you\nknow keeping up with that charge so that\nthey could these establishments could\ncontinue to offer free charging yes\nma'am they have been I've been assured\nthat most of them the software will be a\nsoftware change for how it's built and\nnow some of them you know like you'll\nsee in one of the bill changes that were\nmade that Tesla uses an app now their\ncharger doesn't have a a screen to look\nat it you look through your app each of\nthem has a little bit different method\nof how they know who you are know for\nyou to pay it but most important for\nRick and all of us should be that we get\nour excise tax to keep our roads and\nbridges in good shape thank you Mr\nchairman I think this is great Bill and\nwe're off to a great start with electric\nvehicles just a little bit concerned\nabout those free Chargers thank you\nthank you ma'am\ngentlemen yield yes sir\nrepresentative drenner to your left\nthank you Mr chairman there's a\ngentleman yield yes ma'am\nI agree with uh\nthat this is a great first start I'm I'm\njust curious with these changes in the\nbill\nis this going to make Georgia about the\nmost expensive place in the nation to\nown and operate uh EV vehicle\nno ma'am it will not with a change\nespecially you know going from like say\n9 to 11 it'll put us in the middle of\nthe pack\nwhen when it was at nine we were\nprobably at the highest but with 11\nwe'll be in the middle\nthank you Mr chairman yes ma'am\nrepresenting Martin to your right has a\nquestion Mr chairman Mr chairman would\nyield for a question oh absolutely isn't\nit true that the way we treat\num electricity uh sale for resale and\nsomeone having to pay tax on as you\nmentioned it's just like you would for\nthat Coca-Cola you mentioned you either\npay sales tax or the the person that's\ngiven away has to pay a use tax so we're\ntreating electricity the same way it\nisn't that true yes sir you're right\nthank you and the next question I wanted\nto ask is about the the fee for the\nregistration uh can you you talk about\nthe need for this to go into place and\nthen that is isn't it true that in in\nrules you mentioned that that fee would\nbe looked at over the over the years to\nmake sure it's being right size and is\nappropriate you're talking about the fee\nthat the registration fee yes yes yeah\nand we will I think the key thing that's\ncoming on that you'll see with GDOT is\nnow has a pilot program to look at\nvehicle miles traveled which will\nprobably put a lot of light on that\nwhere they that fee is at the right\nplace or it in\nrepresentative Tran to your left\nhas a question the gentleman's\nrecognized yes sir thank you Mr Speaker\nwill the chairman yield to a question\nabsolutely so I very much support this\nbill and we'll be voting for it but I\nhave had a lot of constituents ask for\nclarify clarification and that is for\nlack of a better term dumb stations\ncharging stations that do not have\nNetwork capability and app capability\nare not able to meter their electrical\nuses and there are essentially free\ncharging stations will we be in this\nbill be mandating them to upgrade their\ntheir charging stations oh absolutely we\nwill I think number one representative\nwe need to make sure that they're\naccurate\nthat and that they're safe and I think\nthose are two important things and most\nimportant to me I guess is the taxation\nside of it but we've got to make sure\nthey're accurate and safe there is a\nlong lead time you look at the effective\ndates of these bills\nit's down the road so they're going to\nhave time to change and update\ndo you yield for one further question\nsure yes sir do you know what that deal\ntime is is it one year five years the\nlead time on this is 20 end of 25. I'm\nnot mistaken in that you know the neat\nthing about this is like everything we\ndo in this building I'll have a list of\nfour things that I need to work on\nduring the interim to perfect what I\nhave here and uh and we'll be working on\nthat in the next year thank you thank\nyou\nis that it Mr Speaker you've got a\ncouple you got a couple more if you want\nto take them we want to make sure\neverybody understands this\nrepresentative Kennard is recognized to\nyour left for our question thank you Mr\nSpeaker this is the gentleman yield\nabsolutely we currently assess a 26 Cent\nper gallon fuel tax how does that what\nis that calculus with a kilowatt per\nhour cost and is it Equitable it is\nEquitable that was a key thing that\nRevenue worked on to make sure it was\nEquitable and we through House Bill 170\ngive them the authority to do that and\nif you read through the bill you'll see\nthese These are Equitable numbers to a\ngallon of gasoline yeah one more\nquestion sure so the\ngasoline-powered car user and the\nelectric car user are basically paying\nthe same exact state tax fuel tax yes\nokay the other thing about gasoline is\nmore on use the more you drive the more\nyou pay and for a fee base as chairman\nMartin was talking about they're paying\n213 or so for a year\nno mileage included in that so it's a\nlittle different how we do it so EB\nusers are not being penalized oh no in\nno way they are no sir thank you\nchairman Carpenter to your right in the\nrear has a question does the gentleman\nyield yes sir is it not true that this\nthis tax will will allow Georgians to\nmake sure that we're taxing individuals\nthat are driving through our state that\nare currently paying tax on gas\nhopefully that they when they stop to\ncharge that they'll be paying taxes for\nour roads ABS absolutely Mr chairman\nthey'll also be buying coca-colas and\nwieners and eating at restaurants as\nthey go through the state thank you\nthank you for this bill\nMr chairman if there are no other\nquestions I yield well and ask for you\nyou have some questions but I'll be glad\nto let you know let's keep let's keep on\ngoing one couple more and then we'll\ndon't let your feet grow to the floor up\nthere now representative\num\nLisa Campbell is recognized for a\nquestion to your left sure thank you Mr\nSpeaker does the gentleman yield yes\nma'am I have a question related to line\n398 on page 17 which talks about no\nperson shall transport motor Fuel and it\nlooks like we've also added over public\nhighways or navigable Waters\nof this state and I'm this may already\nbe prohibited but my question is that\ndoes that also apply to rail transport\nand if not why not if in here we're\ntalking about on public highways or\nadaptive Waters except in a transport\ntruck or a vessel marked appropriately\nso yes I'm a gasoline usually is not\ntransported by rails it's not no ma'am\nthank you for the clarification that I\nknow of\nMr

seeks to\num make it clear to individuals who we\nappreciate working in our Correctional\nFacilities uh to ensure that they're\nsafe and there's no bad actor there that\nif you're a contractor or an employee of\nthe Georgia Department of Corrections\nand you bring a legal Contraband to uh\ngive to an inmate that the penalty goes\nfrom two to ten years and it does not\nhave the the the Restriction to probate\nso there is no mandatory minimum in here\nbut it does raise the the um the\nsentence to 10 years\nMr Speaker I will yield for a question\nas if there is any\nyou have no questions but we do have a\nspeaker so you have no questions thank\nyou gentleman's yielded well\nrepresentative Kennard is recognized to\nspeak to the bill represent Kennard\nthank you Mr Speaker today I Rise to\noppose SB 159\nand at the risk of sounding preachy\nI'm going to open my remarks with a\nhandful of scriptures\nI'm very aware that the Bible can be\nused to manipulate and it can even be\nweaponized and that is not my intent\nhopefully it's not my impact today\nI am also extremely cognizant that the\nscripture is very versatile and can be\nskillfully used to say just about\nanything you wanted to say and to\nsupport or oppose virtually any issues\nfor instance during the Civil War\nboth Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis\nDavis both toured their parts of the\ncountry using the Bible to build their\nrespective cases because there are\nanti-slavery and pro-slavery passages in\nthe Bible you can find plenty of verses\nto support either side it is a very\nversatile 66 book\ncollection indeed\nthat said\nI'm a pastor and I'm all in I have built\na career around the studying and\nteaching of this Christian scripture\nI'm over 35 years in now and that in no\nway makes me an expert far from it as a\nmatter of fact the older I get the less\nhubris I have\nI tend to have a lot more questions than\nanswers\nbut where my greatest confidence lies is\nin the four gospels the words that are\nwritten in red and for many years now\nthe words of Jesus of Nazareth have been\nalmost my exclusive Focus for my\npersonal devotion\nand my Teaching Ministry\nand I would be disingenuous to say that\nmy faith does not impact my worldview\nbecause it does\nas a matter of fact I would be truthful\nin saying that my spiritual journey\ninfluences everything I do\nincluding my decision to run for office\nand to be in this room\nThe Words of Christ have been imprinted\non my subconscious since I was a small\nchild words like to whom much is given\nmuch is required words like you are the\nlight of the world you are the salt of\nthe earth\nand the implication is to for all of us\nas enlightened Spiritual Beings to get\nout and make an impact to come out of\nour space spiritual zones our churches\nour mosques our temples and to occupy\nspace right in the middle of society in\nthe world and to do what we can to make\na positive difference to make the world\na better place\nnow that I've pre-ambled for a minute\nhere I've set a stage to provide a\ncontext because I believe the words\nyou're about to hear the ones written in\nred are germane to the issue at hand at\nleast they are to me\nin the Gospel of Luke it was Jesus's\nfirst public conversation his first\npublic words\nhe was in the temple worshiping\nat the place of his Youth and it was his\nturn to provide the scripture of the day\nand he grabbed the scroll from Isaiah\nand read these words\nthe spirit of the Lord is on me because\nhe has anointed me to Proclaim good news\nto the poor\nhe has sent me to Proclaim freedom for\nthe prisoners\nand recovery of sight for the blind to\nset the oppressed free to proclaim the\nyear of the Lord's favor this is Jesus's\nfirst inaugural talk\nhe was establishing a mission and a\nvision for Jesus Incorporated it was a\nmain part of his agenda\nhe was establishing what was important\nwhat was priority and in that two\nsentences he mentions interaction with\nprisoners now this was an ongoing theme\nfor Christ\na passage that we're all familiar with\nis from Matthew 25 as a matter of fact\nthe late speaker Roston used it last\nyear when he was presenting H.B 1013.\nMatthew 25 reads like this then the king\nwill say to those on his right\ncome you who are blessed by my father\ntake your inheritance the kingdom\nprepared for you since the creation of\nthe world for I was hungry\nand you gave me something to eat I was\nthirsty and you gave me something to\ndrink I was a stranger and you invited\nme in I needed clothes and you clothed\nme I was sick and you looked after me\nand wait for it\nI was in prison\nand you came to visit me\nthen the righteous will answer him Lord\nwhen did we see you hungry and feed you\nwhen did we see you thirsty and gave you\nsomething to drink when did we see you a\nstranger invite you in or needing\nclothes and clothe you when did we see\nyou in sick or in prison and go to visit\nyou and the King will reply truly I tell\nyou\nwhatever you did\nfor one of the least of these brothers\nand sisters of mine\nyou did for me and then it goes on to\nsay and he will say to those on his left\ndepart from me you who are cursed into\nthe Eternal fire prepared for\nI was hungry and you gave me nothing to\neat I was thirsty and you gave me\nnothing to drink I was a stranger and\nyou did not invite me in I needed\nclothes you did not clothe me I was sick\nand in prison and you did not look after\nme\nthey will also answer Lord when did we\nsee you hungry or thirsty or a stranger\nand eating clothes or sick or in prison\nand didn't I help you and he will reply\ntruly I tell you whatever you did not do\nfor one of the least of these you did\nnot do for me\nwhat I'm doing is establishing what was\nclearly the priorities for Jesus's\npublic Ministry and in that those two\nscriptures he establishes that prisoners\nand prisons were not a peripheral issue\nit wasn't at the bottom of the list this\nwas at the top of the list like top five\nnow it's not lost on me that Jesus was\ncrucified between two thieves\nto felons they all sat on death row\ntogether awaiting their capital\npunishment\nso Christ was compelling us of not\ncommanding us to be involved on a\npersonal level with hunger\nsickness\nand the prison system to be consistently\ninvolved this was not just a part of the\nministry this was the ministry and it\ncompels us to be involved too not just\nmaking in end of your donation to the\ncause not to just go to a soup line\nduring the holidays but these were that\nJesus things is Central focus and\nMission the main things he wanted his\nfollowers to have a deep understanding\nof these priority issues hunger poverty\nhealth care and yes incarceration\nhe wanted us to have better\nunderstanding the word understand\nliterally means to stand under\nin other words when you have proximity\nto an issue when you stand under it you\nwill have better and deeper\nunderstanding of it because from a\ndistance issues look one way but when\nyou get up close and personal you have a\ndeeper more thoughtful mindful\nunderstanding of it and when you start\nhaving proximity to these issues like\nhunger and homelessness and\nincarceration and health care\nwhen you engage on a consistent basis\nyou start asking questions questions\nlike why do we have hunger to begin with\nquestions like why do we have\ndisparities in health care to begin with\nquestions like why do we have this many\nnumber of people incarcerated to begin\nwith\nso I want us to take a minute\nthis morning to look under\nour prison system and see firsthand\nwhat's going on and who is behind bars\nwhen you stand under our prison system\nwhen you look at who is behind bars in\nthe state of Georgia you're going to see\nsome consistent groups number one\nis you're going to see the mentally ill\nyou're going to see the mentally ill and\nthose who suffer\nfrom substance use\nwe have made some great strides with HB\n1013 the mental health parity act that\nwe passed last year and hopefully we'll\nsee the passage of HB 520 this year\nwe're making strides to turn this corner\nbut as it sits right now the largest\nmental health service provider in our\nstate is Georgia State\nprisons\nso when you look under the system\nit's going to be a glaring Stark\nreminder that is the mentally ill and\nthose who suffer from substance use that\nare being locked up in our prison system\nsecondly you're going to see the poor\nincarcerated\nmost of the folks locked up in our state\nprison system had a public defender\nwhy because they did not have enough\nfinancial resources to lawyer up and to\nget really good representation\nas a result they're getting what they\ncan take and there are a lot of good\npublic defenders out there and we\nappreciate them I know a lot of them\nbut the the reality is is they're\noverworked\ntheir case loads are stretched then and\nthey cannot properly represent the folks\nthat they do and unfortunately the poor\nget harsher sentences longer sentences\nyou're going to see the poor Behind Bars\nwhen you look underneath our prison\nsystem you're also going to see in\naddition to the mentally ill and the\npoor you're going to see minority groups\nit's glaring\nthe truth is in this Century one in\nthree African-American males will have a\nbrush up with the justice system for\nwhite males that is one in 17.\nthere are more African-American males\ninvolved in our correction system in\nAmerica today then were enslaved in 1850\nGeorgia's African-American population is\n30 percent\nbut in our prison system\nAfrican-Americans represent almost 60\npercent you have to ask why\nis it because African-Americans are more\ninherently criminal no it's just there\nis bias in our system that cannot be\ndenied\njust a couple of weeks ago we passed\ncompensation resolutions for Mario\nstinchcomb Michael Woolfolk devania\nInman and Terry Talley who we discovered\nwere wrongfully convicted\nMario and Michael spent 18 years each\ndevonia Inman spent 23 years\nTerry Talley Smith 39 years wrongfully\nconvicted that's almost A Century Of\nTime\nof four\nof those who were wrongfully commit\nconvicted were African-American males\nwhen we look deeper into our prison\nsystem we can't even ignore the economic\ndrivers some say that crime doesn't pay\nI depend I say it depends on who you're\nasking\nif you're asking core Civic\nthat has private for-profit prisons in\nGeorgia they'll say the crime actually\ndoes pay they're doing really well\nthey're traded on they're traded\npublicly you can buy their stock on the\nstock market today it's about nine bucks\na share\nsome say the crime doesn't pay I say it\ndepends on who you're asking why don't\nwe ask Southeast Corrections A\nfor-profit Private Probation company\nthat handles a significant amount of the\nprobationers in our state if you ask\nthem they'll say business is really good\nespecially in Georgia because we have\nmore people on probation than any other\nstate four times the national average\nI think we have lost understanding of\nour criminal and prison system and we\nare legislating from a distance now and\nwe have lost touch\nand that's why we have done such an\nabout face on Criminal Justice Reform\nwe've lost our way and that's why we're\nseeing all these heavy hitting\nsentencing measures we're not interested\nin Justice we're not even interested in\npunishment\nthese measures better reflect vengeance\nwhen you look at SB 159 lines\n61-63 it's a testament to how far off we\nare\nin line 61 through 63 of SB 159 it says\nthat if a prison employee hands someone\nincarcerated a cigarette if they just\ngive them a cigarette\nthey will go to prison not for one two\nthree four five six seven eight nine\nyears but for 10 years for handing\nsomeone a cigarette\nor for a swig of alcohol\nin what Universe does that even make\nsense\nthat someone serves 10 years for a\ncigarette\nAbraham Maslow said if we only have if\nthe only tool we have is a hammer\nthen you see every problem as a nail\nGovernor deal tried to expand our\ntoolbox and give us more options but to\nuse an old term from my Bible Belt\nPentecostal days we have backslid It's\nhammer time in Georgia and we are Too\nLegit to Quit\nour Compass needs to be recalibrated we\nreally need to check our hearts and\nthink about what we're doing because I\nremind you Jesus said how you treat the\nincarcerated is a reflection on how you\nfeel about him\nwhatever you've done for the least of\nthese you've done it unto me\nso my thoughts are my thoughts are we\nshould examine our hearts and figure out\na more respectful honorable humane way\nto incarcerate\nI think we should double down on our\nefforts to decriminalize mental health\nto decriminalize Poverty to\ndecriminalize race and get our\nincarceration rates down let's get our\nprison facilities up to a habitable\nstandard many of them which are not\nI visit our state prisons I've on a tour\nnow to visit all of them all 34. I've\ngot about halfway done uh covet kind of\nstopped me in my tracks but I'm getting\nback on that circuit but our our prisons\nneed a lot of help\nthey're in poor conditions\nwe also need to be more transparent\nabout those conditions\nour doc employees\nshould start being compensated for what\nthey deserve to get out of financial\ndesperation we're we're paying them so\nlittle they have to be in financial\ndesperation that makes them susceptible\nto this bartering that may be going on\nSB 159\ndoes nothing to help our Workforce\nchallenges in the doc and it probably\nmakes them worse\nnow please understand me\npeople who break the law should pay\nconsequences\nbut our state motto is Justice\nmoderation and wisdom\nin our prison policies are none of those\nthree they're not just they're not\nmoderate and they're just not smart\nwhen Georgia was established as a as a\ncolony by James Oglethorpe we were\nestablished as a penal colony\nprisoners from England would come to the\nGeorgia colony to work off their senates\nsome may argue that we still are\nthat we're living up to that Legacy\nchief justice Boggs told us just a week\nago\nthat in the U.S 1 in 33 are under\nCongressional control\nin Georgia that number is 1 in 13.\nlisten we have 10.7 million people\nin this state and we have\n4.523 criminal records individual\ncriminal records almost 40 percent\nladies and gentlemen of this chamber I'm\nvery sincere in saying this but I think\nwe can do better\nand I look forward to working towards a\nbetter Georgia with better Criminal\nJustice policies better prison policies\nand for this reasons that I just\noutlined I am voting though to SB 159\nand I encourage you to do so\nthank you Mr Speaker I yield the well\ngentleman has yielded the

drugs\nguns and telephone Telecommunications\nisn't that what this bill does\nI've always known the gentleman to be a\ndiligent reader of legislation I'm sure\nhe believes what he so speaks\nfor what purpose does chairman Newton\nrise\nparliamentary inquiry State inquiry Mr\nSpeaker isn't it true that the out one\nof the outcomes of passing SB 159 would\nbe to decrease smuggled weapons weapons\nthat are smuggled to criminal prisoners\nand this decrease will help protect\nthose who are incarcerated trying to\nserve their sentence and get some\ntraining and get out and be part of\nsociety\nif the gentleman is those States for\nwhat purpose is Chairman Sainz rise\nparliamentary inquiry State inquiry is\nit not true that both the defenses\nattorneys Association and the\nprosecutors Association both didn't have\nobjection to this bill during committee\nand those slightly beyond the scope of\nthis bill I started having questions\nabout judicial discretion when Pontius\nPilate sentences Christ to crucifixion\nI'm sure the gentleman knows what he\nStates\nfor what purposes representing Maynor\nrise\nparliamentary inquiry Mr Speaker the\nstate tree inquiry is it not true that I\ndo agree that we should not let law\nenforcement\nprovide Contraband to\num those that are jailed but recently on\nthe news there was a Jailer that\nwas doing inappropriate behavior with an\ninmate which involved\nContraband\num and although she should not have done\nthat I know she does not want to be in\nprison for 10 years for doing that\ninappropriate behavior that was on the\nnews\nis that not true\nI'm sure if it was on the news it must\nbe true\nthe\nif the ladies those States\nfor what purposes represent events\nrise\nparliamentary inquiries sir inquiry\nis it not true that this bill is not\nabout the treatment of inmates who were\nconvicted and incarcerated because of\ntheir crimes\nbut about the employees and vendors who\nknowingly flaunt the laws they know\nbetter than break for the almighty\ndollar and that we are a state that\nshould conform to laws\nif the gentleman sow States I'm sure he\nbelieves that for what purposes chairman\nCollins rise parliamentary inquiry State\ninquiry Mr Speaker is it not true that\nthese criminal street gangs are\nproviding these cell phones to inmates\nand as as such these inmates are using\ntheir influence outside of the prison\nsystem to wreak havoc and cause public\nsafety issues for all of Georgia\nregardless of where your ZIP code is or\nwhere you live is that not true Mr\nSpeaker\nStates yes sir\nI'll tell you we're going to tell I'm\ngoing to take two more we've debated\nthis issue pretty well\nfor what purposes representative Vermont\nrise\nparliamentary inquiry State your inquiry\nthank you Mr Speaker is it not true that\none of the biggest problems in our\nprison system is that people continue to\nreturn to that prison system and\nparticularly there's a correlation with\nhow long they are in that prison system\nand how often they come back based on\nthat length so as we continue to pursue\nthese laws we need to be aware of what\nwe are doing to those individuals\nI'm sure the lady believes what she says\nStates for what purpose is whip\nBurchette rise parliamentary inquiry\nState your inquiry thank you Mr Speaker\nis it not true that uh evidence by\nAlliance 55 4 through 56 that the\nlanguage reads here term of imprisonment\nof 10 years and because we struck that\nlanguage\nthe judge can read it to say we can\nprobate\nnine years and serve one isn't that true\nMr Mr Speaker if the gentleman's those\nStates\nthe judge has that discretion\nhave all members voted\nhave all members voted if so the clerk\nwill lock the machine on the passage of\nthe bill the yeas were 103 the Nays 72\nthe bill haven't received the requisite\nconstitutional majority is therefore\npassed\nMr Clerk\nif you'll read the caption to Senate\nBill 168 168.\nSenate Bill 168 by Senator Williams the\n25th to be entitled knack to amend part\n8 of article a to chapter 14 and title\n44 of the fish go to George annotated\nrelating the liens of hospitals and\nnursing homes so as to allow a\nchiropractic practice to have a lien on\na cause of action\nMiss Bill Adam referred to the committee\non Judiciary that committee recommends\nthat this bill do pass\nrepresentative leopard is recognized to\npresent the bill\nladies and gentlemen of the house I'm\npresenting you Senate Bill 168 another\nbill initiated by our former colleague\nSenator Rick Williams\nI know representative Thomas always\nenjoys a good Yogi Bear quote and I\nthink this is deja vu all over again\nwould be appropriate for this this bill\nbecause I believe this has been tried\nbefore and we're hoping this year it\nfinally makes it it amends our an\nexisting statute referred to often as\nthe hospital lien statute it's a statute\nwhich allows hospitals and Physicians\nand nursing homes and and burn Trauma\nCenters a lien against a cause of action\nnot against the individual not against\nthe individual patients property but\nagainst the cause of action so that they\ncan increase the chances they'll get\npaid basically what that means is if\nthere's a settlement based on a claim\nthat the patient had against a third\nparty like in a car accident or\nsomething of that nature the the lien\nhelps the the health care provider get\npaid from the proceeds of any settlement\nor verdict\num so we currently allow this procedure\nfor hospitals nursing homes I think I\nmentioned the the entities that are\nentitled to use it we're basically\nadding Chiropractic practices to the the\nentities who would be entitled to the\nlien and that's important because\nfrequently at least in the in the motor\nvehicle accident context chiropractors\nare often the ones who provide a service\num and the patient at that time does not\nhave money to pay the bill and this\nhelps ensure that when the patient gets\na judgment or gets a settlement that at\nthat point the chiropractor can get paid\num so the um the the other provision\nthere was a change made on the floor of\nthe Senate which allow which basically\nsays if the chiropractor is treating\nsomeone who was a patient that was\ninsured in a plan that they participate\nin they have to make a claim on the\ninsurance first and if they get paid\naccording to the terms of the insurance\nplan they can file the lien as a\nprotective measure but at the end of the\nday they cannot enforce that lien if\nthey've been paid by the insurance\ncompany so we believe this is a much\nneeded uh protection for chiropractors\nit puts them in the same classification\nas doctors and hospitals under the\nstatute and will help make sure that\nthey get paid for the services they\nprovide to Georgians and it also has\nthat consumer protection that requires\nthat both the chiropractors and\nhospitals and the other Health Care\nProfessionals entitled to the\nprotections of the bill\ndo have to make that claim on insurance\nfirst and can't enforce the lien unless\nthey uh have the claim has been denied\nin some fashion so that's that's the\ngist of the bill Mr Speaker I'll stand\nfor any questions you have a couple of\nthe gentleman yields I yield\nminor minority leader of this house\nleader Beverly has a question is\nrecognized thank you Mr Speaker I want\nto draw your attention lines 84 through\n88 isn't it true\nthat\nthrough lines 84 88 will simply required\nthat providers filed with insurers to\nget a claim rejected before enforcing\nany lien that's exactly correct and one\nfurther question is it further true that\nproviders have negotiated with the\ninsurers for rates already and indeed\nthey have as we like to say in this\nbuilding Mr leader of the gentleman\nknows of what he speaks thank you very\nmuch good Bill thank you for the\nquestion gentlemen has another question\nrepresentative Frye to your left has a\nquestion\nthank you Mr speakers gentleman yield I\nyield\num so is this still going to allow the\nwhen you say a lien is this going to go\non the individual's credit if the\ninsurer denies the claim\nor is it just a lien to file against the\nclaim for the insurance payment well\nit's it's considered legally to be a\nlien against the cause of action so it\ndoesn't necessarily apply to the\ninsurance payment but if the insurance\ncompany pays and settlement of the claim\nthen it would attach to that so it\ndoesn't attach the property it doesn't\nattach to any land that the patient owes\nand it doesn't follow the patient it's\njust again against any money that's paid\non the settlement I can't speak as to\nwhether it shows up on credit\num I I do know it's it's the liens are\nfiled in the clerk's office and I\nsuppose those could be reported by\nCredit Agencies but again the the goal\nhere is to make sure that\nthe chiropractor in this case gets paid\nfrom that those settlement proceeds okay\nthank you for your answer thank you for\nthe question\ngentlemen yield for another question yes\nMr Speaker I'll yield\nchairman Knight to your right is\nrecognized for a question this is\ngentleman yield I yield yes sir\nto my friend in the well friendly\nquestion isn't this just the bill that\nsort of cracking open the code allowing\nfor adjustments\nso that our chiropractors can be treated\nI don't know fairly and equally\nas the other providers are that's\nexactly correct thank you sir\nand artfully asked I might add\nsome further questions I'm sorry well\nthank you no further questions no\nfurther questions all you the well and\nask everyone's favorable consideration\nof Senate Bill 168. thank you\nis

the well\nmembers if you will give your attention\nto the lady in the well\nchair lady Dempsey is recognized to\npresent the bill\n[Music]\nthank you Mr Speaker\ngood afternoon I'm bringing to you a\nvery serious measure No Doubt\nit's not very complicated what we're\nproposing to do today\nbut I know there's a lot of passion and\na lot of heart and a lot of different\nfeelings in this room and throughout our\nstate about it the intent of this bill\nhsb62\nit is a modest reform that merely\nensures no city in Georgia goes down the\ndangerous path that cities such as Los\nAngeles and Austin Texas have gone down\nwhere they have encouraged Street\nsleeping and camping\nwe know that street camps most\nimportantly\nare dangerous for homeless people\nthemselves\nwhen I leave this Capital every day and\nI drive toward a place over near\nCentennial Park where I stay\nI usually pass at least 25 people\nthat are setting up and the later in the\nday it is the more people that are there\nsome are intense\nsome simply have cardboard\nsome just have blankets\nthey're in nooks and crannies\nfrom the U.S Postal Service door to\nrestaurants to businesses that are\ntrying to thrive down Marietta Street\nwhen I come here\nfrom Rome and I get off of the\ninterstate I can always count on someone\ncoming up to my car and asking me for\nmoney\nthey're not always very nice about it\neither I've had my car scratched I've\nhad them Jump On It\nI don't have a legislative tag on my car\nanymore because it's not really safe as\na female to sometimes let people know\nexactly who you are\nStreet camps are dangerous for the\npeople\nthe cities that have allowed it have\nseen increases in the number of homeless\ndeaths and violence against those people\nwho are searching for a better safer\nplace to be every single night\nwhen the city of Atlanta has almost 50\npercent of its shelter beds unused\nlarge amounts of other unused beds\nacross our state we should not have\ncities who are looking away\nas people choose or feel they must find\ndifferent places to put their head every\nnight they're not all adults some are\nchildren and that's truly tragic\nthis bill requires a performance audit\nof state and local government homeless\nspending\nthat audit will be done to make sure\nthat we know that that as I said State\nlocal and federal dollars that are\npassing through Georgia's hands\nare going exactly where we think they\nshould be and are maximizing the\nbenefits of that chairman Houston and I\nboth through Economic Development and\nthrough the human resources budget both\nhave buckets of this money\nand it is hard to deal with the\npainfulness\nthat we know those people\nare not getting all of the services all\nof the housing all of the needs that\nthey need but we do not know exactly who\nthey are or how much it is so this audit\nwill help with that\nit will be done by December 31st with a\nreport to the governor lieutenant\ngovernor and the speaker\nthe audit will be done by the Georgia\nDepartment of audits and accounts they\ndo performance audits on so many things\nthroughout our state from tax incentive\nprograms and and scholarship programs I\nthink that they can do the very best job\non making sure that we do this it's not\nduplicative it will be true to the\nresources that we have as a state to\nbetter provide the services that are\nneeded to help people not have to search\nevery night for a place to live\nother state and local governments such\nas Washington have done this and have\nfound great success with knowing exactly\nwhere they can best effectively spend\nthe bill also prevents hospitals and\nlocal governments from taking homeless\npeople and dropping them off in other\ncommunities\nwhere they don't have any place to go or\nany means of support\neveryone everyone should be concerned\nabout anyone that we pass\nthat is without a home there is no doubt\nthe goal is to find primitive permanent\nSupportive Housing for each and every\nindividual who's struggling with mental\nhealth\nhomelessness loss of income\nbut in the meantime we need to know the\nwho the what and the why to plan\naccordingly\nMr Speaker\nI will take questions if there are some\nthe lady the lady year she has a couple\nof questions several of them yes as a\nmatter of fact\nrepresent Al is represent is recognized\nfor a question to your right\nthank you does the lady yield I do\nmy questions have to do with section two\nof the bill if you look to lines 44\nthrough 46 I'm just going to go through\nthis slowly because when I was reading\nit there's a lot of like double and\ntriple negatives that kind of Stack Up\non each other but lines 44-46 prohibit\ncounties or municipalities from being\nable to decide not to enforce ordinances\nto prosecute the in-house for sleeping\nOutdoors\nhow does this not\npreempt local control\nthis simply says that if you have an\nordinance if you have decided to have an\nordinance or a policy\nthat you cannot just decide to make any\npublic or any person's property your\nliving environment\nif that policy is there in that\ngoverning\nmunicipality or County they cannot\nignore it it must be upheld it's also\nnot telling anyone that they have to\nhave them but if they do like any other\nlaw in our state it needs to be enforced\nso just to follow up on those ordinances\nneeding to be enforced if the lady will\nfurther yield for one more question\ncertainly so related to what you just\nsaid if officers of the peace and\nProsecuting attorneys are now required\nto obey these ordinances and to\nprosecute these\nrelatively low level offenses how does\nthis not end up diverting Time Manpower\nand resources from prosecuting\nviolent crime which I know we all care\nvery much about\nsome of these can lead to violent crimes\nas I said there have been a lot of\ndeaths in homeless random encampments\nnot supervised across our nation tell me\nexactly which lines you were referring\nto now please represent it was the same\n44-46 my point was just being that if\nthey are required to enforce these\nordinances does this not drain resources\nfrom\nProsecuting violent crime that's already\ntaken place not prospective or projected\nI think we have to understand that we're\nlooking at someone who's in a tragic\nsituation when we see someone sleeping\nright now law enforcement in many\ncommunities across our state are\nstopping and trying to lend a hand\ntrying to help find them a place the\nidea is not to criminalize it it is to\nmake sure that those communities who are\nignoring it actually do pick up local\ncontrol and do decide what is best for\ntheir community and the number that are\nseeking help or need help once we have\nthis audit will be much more manageable\nfor them to do it is not to take someone\ndirectly to jail this is to help not\nonly make our community safer but to\nextend the the love and charitable\nHospitality I think hospitable work to\nmake sure that someone has a better\nplace than a sidewalk\nso you're saying that Prosecuting\nsleeping Outdoors is helping\nhomeless people no I'm saying exactly\nthe opposite exactly the opposite\nthe bill says the opposite\nlady here for another question yes we're\ngoing to say Butler to your left is\nrecognized for a question\nthank you does the lady yelled I do\num\nabout three years ago it was the win\nwinner before covid uh representative\nRoger Bruce and I went to meet with the\ngovernor about several encampments that\nare on our way to the Capitol and we're\nconcerned about the people that were\nthere we were told then that there was a\ncount done once a year of the homeless\npeople\nhere in the metro area\nand I was wondering I understand this is\nan audit of funds that are available do\nyou have anything well is there anything\nput back in place to continue that count\nbecause during covid they stopped doing\nthe actual count of the number of people\nand and I was just wondering if this\nreplaces that if this is just different\nis that count going to continue because\nit seems we would need to have some\nsense of who is out there so we'd know\nabout the resources that we want to\nallocate absolutely and that's part of\nthis the count is a federal measure it\nhappens actually throughout our whole\nstate on that one night though so you\nget that one snapshot of one night what\nis going on and as the night begins\nsometimes people are not as available to\nbe counted sometimes people are there\nbecause they want to be counted we're\ntrying to get more of a handle around\nhow much it is it hurts me to not give\nas much money as probably we should\nit should be a higher priority I think\nthis matters that's what the audit is\nabout I think this matters in the same\nway that many of those tax cuts and many\nof the other measures that are audited\ndo measure so this will be to make sure\nthat we know how many who what where\neach Community will have the ability to\ndo more but not to allow Street camping\nif they have that policy if they decide\nif they've decided hey we like it\neverybody come here and stay sleep on\nour sidewalks block the streets make it\nhard for people to get get around let's\nstop Economic Development here let's not\nhave tourism come to Atlanta if anyone\nwants to decide that and if any of us\nfeel good driving past this like it\ndoesn't sound like you did then we are\non the path right now for that\nthank you\nless\nrepresentative Oliver to your left has a\nquestion that ladies recognize for a\nquestion this lady you I certainly do\nI have seven police districts in my\ndistrict\nthree cities an unincorporated DeKalb\nMarta and I also have two universities\npolice districts I have a hospital and\nunincorporated DeKalb I have a hospital\nin city of Atlanta and I have a hospital\nwith City Decatur explain to me how The\nDumping provision works for me in my\ndistrict who can take whom where\nwhen you've had Hospital services or\nneed Hospital Services they need to be\nwhere you are from or where you are\nfound you understand my question I do\nunderstand that in Atlanta it's a little\ncomplicated I do get that and there will\nprobably have to be some ways to work\nthat out but I think that in each and\nevery one of those areas that you've\nsaid there are resources the main thing\nwe want to do is not let someone\nand you'll probably hear more about this\nfrom some of the other speakers some of\nthe stories that are actually really\nhappening where someone just knows that\nthere is a little better opportunity not\nso much in the metro area as much as in\nour rural areas to take them out of\nCounty and then they are no longer seem\nto be a burden for that Community final\nquestion ma'am yes we had no testimony\nabout these alleged stories that are\nhappening and I believe they could be\nhappening but as a practical matter the\nword is not complicated the word is\ntotally unworkable thank you\nMr Speaker I will yield the well as you\nsaid there are several other speakers\nand then um come back if if needed later\nbut I do want to ask y'all to think this\nis a heartfelt measure it goes beyond\nthe ease\nof just saying there's a homeless person\nthere's a tent they're okay tonight it's\ncold it's 10 degrees in Atlanta it's\nokay\nit's a hundred degrees in Atlanta\nthey're okay I think there's compassion\nin all of us to find this is not making\nit impossible it's making it possible to\nmake sure that we spend our resources\nand develop the appropriate programs for\nthose who are in the greatest of need\nthank you Mr Speaker I yield The Well\nthe lady has yielded the well we have a\nnumber of speakers some want to\nrecognize to speak to the bill\nrepresentative Mari Crawford is\nrecognized to speak to the bill resident\nCrawford\nthis is excuse me a gentleman was to\nspend just for a second we have a number\nof folks opposed and those in favor each\nside will be allocated 30 minutes to\nspeak I apologize to you for not getting\nthat clear first the gentleman's\nrecognized\nthank you Mr Speaker\ndistinguished body good afternoon today\nI Rise to oppose Senate Bill 62 because\nof the negative impact that it will have\non our less fortunate\nindeed this is a heartfelt manner\nbut I'll start to say that no one\nchooses to be poor and it was said in\nthis well\nthat this bill will help us to learn the\nwho's the wise and the whats and I don't\ndoubt that this bill could potentially\ndo that but what I would say is let's\nfigure that out before we pass\nSenate bill 62.\nyou see poverty is no accident it's\nman-made and can be removed by human\nactions our actions and we can end or at\nthe very least significantly reduce\npoverty should we choose to but instead\nof assisting those in need we are about\nto pass a bill that will cause more harm\nto our most vulnerable citizens\ntoday my main focus will be to\nconcentrate on section two\nit was previously asked about lines 44\nthrough 46.\nthey read important in part that a\ncounty over a municipal Corporation\nshould not adopt or enforce any written\npolicy which prohibits the enforcement\nof any order or ordinance prohibiting\nunauthorized public Camping sleeping or\nobstruction of sidewalks now that's a\nmouthful but what this plainly means is\nthis bill sets up a path to punish local\ngovernments that don't enforce penalties\nagainst temporary habitation better\nknown as homelessness\ncurrently our local governments who by\nthe way have a better understanding of\ntheir homeless populations\nhave created ordinances that prohibit\nthe homeless population from\ncriminalization\nthis bill if passed would challenge\nthose efforts potentially placing the\npoor in our Criminal Justice System thus\nexacerbating the many factors that lead\nto Poverty to begin with\nbut micromanaging local governments and\njurisdictions will not address the root\ncause of homelessness\nhow blessed are we we get an opportunity\nto call this beautiful place our home\nour second home\nand while the work is tiring it's\nrewarding\nwe get an opportunity to serve as we\nshould be\nand yes we're talented and yes we're\nhere because we work hard but the\nreality is we are all occupying these\nseats because of Fortune\nbut the minute that we walk out of this\ndoor as you just heard there are people\nwho are less fortunate than we are and\nit's our jobs as public servants to help\nthose who are less fortunate\nnow we just had an incredible storm\nyesterday\nthere were people who had to sleep on\nthe streets because they had no places\nto go no one wants to sleep on the\nstreets think about that no one wants to\nbe homeless but we're obligated to help\nthose who are and oddly\nin a room of public servants I feel the\nneed to emphasize\nthat our government our state government\nis funded\nupon the will of the people and it's\ninstituted solely for the good of the\nwhole I place a special emphasis on the\nterm whole\nnow if this sounds familiar to you then\ngood because it comes straight from our\nstate constitution\nyou see we have a duty to serve the\nwhole population especially those with\nlittle to no resources and Senate Bill\n62 is not good for the whole population\nof Georgia\nnow there are many ways that we can help\nwe have the resources to help for\nresidents we can increase State funding\non housing options for the homeless\nadditionally we could address the\naffordable housing crisis we could raise\nminimum wage we can expand Medicaid we\ncan increase funding for mental health\nand increase funding for the Department\nof Community Affairs State Housing Trust\nFund for the homeless we could do all of\nthose things before we passed Senate\nBill 62 but we're choosing not to do\nthat and therefore we are potentially\ncriminalizing those who are homeless and\nif we should pass this bill before we\nactually try to understand and seriously\nas a body shame on us\nbut you can't serve the people that you\ncan't see\nso I ask you do we actually try to see\nthe homeless population and\nunderstanding until they become a\nnuisance To Us by panhandling\nnow I don't doubt that anybody in here\nloves panhandling I understand that too\nmany of you it is a nuisance however\nthat's the best that some people can do\nand we have to understand that and while\nhomelessness\nit's an issue throughout the state of\nGeorgia it's most prevalent in metro\nAtlanta in fact Federal data shows that\nof the approximate 10 000 homeless\npeople in Georgia nearly 70 percent of\nthem live in metro Atlanta so what\nshould be noted that a lot of people in\nthis room amongst our distinguished body\nwho are about to vote on this bill don't\nhave large homeless populations in their\ndistricts in fact the only interaction\nthat you have with homeless populations\nis when you come to the state capitol\nbut even if you don't have large\nhomeless populations in your District we\nshould seek to better understand poverty\nnow as you just heard proponents of this\nbill say that we should have a homeless\npopulation going to shelters well I\ndon't deny that but that argument\ndoesn't account for the challenges that\nsome of our homeless population face\nwhen trying to enter homeless shelters\nthese challenges include but are not\nlimited to the lack of space at shelters\nand we also have to note that a lot of\nour homeless shelters are not equipped\nto accommodate the mentally ill or the\nphysically disabled which means that\nthere will be homeless people who cannot\nget into shelters\nAdditionally the homeless population\nfaces a myriad of problems to include\nbut not limited to\nabuse\nsymptoms of trauma and some have medical\nconditions that said many of our\nhomeless populations will need help\nBeyond shelters\nand again we as a body could help and we\nshould\nnow\nI want to share something with you that\nI learned\nunsurprisingly and I didn't know this\nthe temporary habitation which includes\nthe erection of tents or shelters the\nlaying down of sleeping bags blankets or\nother materials used for bedding on\nhighways is already illegal under\nocg832-66 yes it is already a crime to\nsleep on the side of the road\nhowever a lot of our local governments\nhave done all that they could can do to\nhelp their homeless population because\nthey understand that population better\nthan we do in the state\nI also asked a few solicitor generals\nwho have the largest homeless\npopulations in their districts if\nthey've ever prosecuted anyone under\nthis current statue and as you can\nexpect the informing that they don't\nthey work with local officials to help\nand instead the prosecutors and\nsolicitor generals they find it in their\nbest interest to actually prosecute\ncrimes\nthat we want protection from you know\nthe ones that some of us talked about in\nthis world throughout the legislative\nsession\nunder Senate Bill 62 local jurisdiction\nmust enforce laws prohibiting\nunauthorized Camping sleeping or\nobstruction of sidewalks and\nunfortunately this enforcement will\nincrease the population in our County\njails making our County spend more money\ncriminal penalties for sitting sleeping\nor laying down on the public property\nfor homeless individuals who can't\nobtain shelter will also be a violation\nof the eighth amendment's cruel and\nunusual punishment\nwe shouldn't subject our vulnerable crit\ncitizens to this type of criminal\nprosecution now again coincidentally a\nlot of colleagues have discussed what we\nneed to do with some of our most violent\ncriminals are we about to subject our\nhomeless population to that type of\npunishment we shouldn't\nbut I regret to inform some of our\nsolicitor generals who've never used the\ntemporary habitation statute that\nthey're going to have to now because if\nyou recall we just took away the\ndiscretion of our solicitor generals and\nprosecutors when we pass HB 231\nbut now my question is what problem does\nthis legislation actually solve\nis it going to protect us from the\nhomeless population\nis it going to help the homeless\npopulation to begin with\nbecause the last time that I checked as\nwe are talking about criminals the most\ndangerous criminals the ones that\nactually cause the most harm are the\nones that actually are the most\nprivileged those are the ones that\nactually have homes to go to\nbut further passing this bill will you\nbet it it will increase the racial\ndisparities because as you can imagine\nthe majority of the homeless population\nin our state statistics show are yep\nblack people\nno surprise here that black people in\nGeorgia experience homelessness more\nthan any other group so if Senate Bill\n62 passed this bill could potentially\nhave the same impact of the post-bellum\nsystem criminal justice system that\nlocked black people up simply because\nthey had no place to go and I hope that\nwe as a body don't vote for this\nbuilding go back to those days\nThere's No One path to homelessness\nand we must stop thinking that poverty\nis a moral failing or a choice rooted in\nlaziness a lack of talent or lack of\nintelligence we must end policies and\npractices that criminalize poverty\ninstead we must have bipartisan support\nto help those who need it the most we\ncan't punish people because we as a\nlegislator has not historically provided\npeople with the necessarily resources to\nenjoy what we deem to be the American\ndream\ncriminal codes are already full of\noffenses that punish people for being\npoor we need to repeal them all\nbut we can make progress by opposing\nSenate bill 62.\nbecause again it will negatively impact\nour most vulnerable population allow our\nlocal governments to address their\nhomeless population with the knowledge\nand the resources that they have\nif people are sleeping on the streets I\nask you to help them to help them to get\noff the streets to help them to find\nhousing but at the very least if you\nwant help\nthen move over and allow someone else to\nI ask you to oppose Senate Bill 62\nbecause again it is going to negatively\nimpact our most vulnerable citizens\nthank you Mr Speaker I yield the well\nthe gentleman has yielded well\nrepresentative Holland is recognized to\nspeak to the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker\nI rise today to speak again Senate bill\n62.\nbecause like many of you I started\ngetting a flood of emails in my email\nbox\nfrom advocacy organizations that serve\nthe homeless that said please vote no on\nthis bill\nand I'm an expert on a lot of things\nmost of which never come in handy in\nthis chamber but something I'm not an\nexpert on is homelessness\nand so I thought perhaps it was time to\nlisten to the people who understood how\nhomelessness is impacting our\ncommunities and what we can do to help\nit rather than have the arrogance to\nthink that I knew what was best for my\ncommunity\nbut you know what there's a group of\npeople who have done study on this in\nthis building there is a senate\ncommittee on unsheltered homelessness\nthat released their final report this\nyear\nthey made 26 recommendations for what we\ncould do to relieve homelessness in our\ncommunities\nfor example\npair housing funding with support\nservices including mental and physical\nhealth care\nthis bill does not do that\nprovide free state IDs for people with a\nhomelessness verification letter we\ntalked about this in a previous Bill\nallowing people who were leaving prison\nto have state IDs because it without a\nstate ID you can't do anything you can't\nsecure housing you can't get a job you\ncan't get a cell phone\nprovide free state IDs for people who\nare homeless\nthis bill doesn't do that\nincrease the minimum wage to eradicate\npoverty\nthis bill does not do that\nconnect veterans facing unsheltered or\nsheltered homelessness with assistance\nat the state and federal level\nin other words\nfind the people who have served our\ncountry in the military and connect them\nwith the resources they need\nto allow them to be housed this bill\ndoes not do that\nor the last recommendation I'll mention\noppose the criminalization of\nhomelessness\nthis bill does not do that\nthere was a photojournalist who produced\na picture that has stuck with me for a\nreally long time it is a picture of a\nhomeless man and when I say a homeless\nman it is exactly the picture that just\npopped into your head when I said those\ntwo words together it was a man\nwith a beard and graying hair looking\nunkempt\nin clothes that looked very worn and a\nlittle dirty\nand he's holding a cardboard sign and we\nall know what we expect to see on this\ncardboard sign can you help\nplease spare a dime\nhungry\nthat's not what this man's cardboard\nsign said\nhis cardboard sign said\nI used to be a person\nI used to be a person\nthere was a learning session at my\nchurch where we invited in homelessness\norganizations to help us become better\neducated and that brought up the same\nidea that for many people who are\nexperiencing homelessness the most\ndifficult thing is the invisibility\nhow we walk down the street and we\nsimply look through them\nlook past them as if they are no longer\nhuman beings\nI used to be a person\nthat homeless person could have been\nperhaps the image that didn't pop into\nyour head it could have been a mother\nfleeing an abusive spouse with her\nchildren\nit could have been a teenager who got\nkicked out of his home because he came\nout as gay to his parents\nit could be a person struggling with\naddiction wanting desperately in his\nheart to find a better path but having\nno luck finding a bed\nwhere he could receive services\nit could be a vet\nwith PTSD struggling to connect\nwith those Mental Health Services that\ncould help him get better\nI get asked by constituents a lot about\nwhat the state is doing to address\nhomelessness I live in one of those\ndistricts that is experiencing this as a\nreal challenge we see a growing number\nof families panhandling and shopping\ncenters people sleeping in store\ndoorways or under Highway underpasses\nmy constituents asked me what are we\ndoing to help these people\nwhat are we doing to lift up these\nchildren of God who are suffering how\ncan we help\nnow I have to tell my constituents not\nonly are we not helping the unhoused\nwe're not even seeing them anymore as\npeople\nwe're just seeing them as criminals\nshame on us Mr Speaker I yield the well\nthe lady has yielded the well\nrepresentative Jasmine Clark is\nrecognized to speak to the bill\nrepresentative Clark\nthank you Mr Speaker\ntoday I Rise to ask you to vote no on SB\n62\nand today I want to further what my\ncolleague was talking about\nwhen a person or a family finds\nthemselves in a position where they are\nunhoused\nincarceration\nand criminalization are rarely if ever a\nviable solution\nfalling on Hard Times is hard enough\nI know several of you have gotten emails\nfrom members of community especially\nduring the pandemic that they were\nfacing eviction\nthey were pleading for any type of help\nthat would keep a roof over their head\nor over their family's head\nthe truth is when an individual finds\nthemselves facing homelessness it can\nfeel like the world is kicking them\nwhile they're down\nI'm sure every person in here is\nprivileged enough that you've never had\nto experience this but have you ever\ntried to navigate finding housing after\nyou've been evicted\nit's very hard\nfor those who will allow individuals\nwith a previous eviction with a second\nchance it usually requires a lot of\nresources\nhuge deposits multiple months of rent up\nfront\nif a person is already struggling these\nrequirements can feel insurmountable\nso let's say they can't find that\npermanent housing they can't find an\napartment that they can get those\ndeposits and those months of rent up\nfront\nsometimes then a person might say well I\nhave to go somewhere let me find a hotel\nroom\nit's not perfect but it's better than\nsleeping on the street\nthe problem is hotels are expensive\nit can cost 99 to almost 200 dollars per\nweek to stay in an extended stay\nand I know it may be hard for some of\nyou all to Fathom this but not everyone\nhas that kind of money in their pocket\nevery single week\nand even if they do have that type of\nmoney\nif they're using that money to pay for a\nhotel then how are they saving so they\ncan afford that huge deposit that they\nneed so they can get into something more\npermanent\nit's very difficult to save money when\nyou're spending pretty much all that you\nhave just to keep a roof over your head\nso you and your children don't have to\nsleep on the street\nbut let's say a person can't afford a\nhotel or they can't find a hotel or\nthey're put out of a hotel that they're\nin and they can't find another one\nthey may seek out a homeless shelter\nbut the problem with this is that every\nshelter doesn't have room for those\nseeking help and some of these shelters\nare very stringent on who can come to\nthat show shelter and they don't allow\naccess to every single person needing\nhelp\nand I know this might come as a surprise\nbecause it came as a surprise to me but\nsome shelters actually charge a fee in\norder for you to get into the homeless\nshelter it's not free\nand that's because they need money in\norder to operate and they're not getting\nit from other places and so even though\nthis fee is probably pretty small to\nsome of us\nfor some other people this is cost\nprohibitive and they are not able to go\ninto that shelter\nso now what's left\nI can't find permanent housing because I\ncan't afford these huge deposits\nI can't afford to stay in a hotel for\nweeks and weeks at a time\nI can't get into a homeless shelter\nbecause of the requirements for that\nshelter or because I can't afford it I\ncan't even afford to get into a shelter\nmaybe I have a car that's what I'll do\nI'll sleep in my car and a parking lot\nsomewhere\nif my car hasn't already been\nrepossessed because I'm really on hard\ntimes right now\nand even if I have that car there's no\nguarantee that I will not come I will\nnot interact with law enforcement\nbecause I parked in the wrong place\nso now where do I go\nif a person finds themselves having to\nsleep on the street it's not because\nthat's where they want to sleep there\nare very few people out here that chose\neither I'm going to stay in an apartment\nor I'm going to sleep on the street\nthere's a whole lot that happened in\nbetween then\nthese are people having hard times they\nare not criminals it is not against the\nlaw to be poor it is not against the law\nto lose your job it is not against the\nlaw for your job to not pay you maybe it\nshould be not pay you because your baby\nwas sick and you needed to take off work\nand when you take off work you don't get\npaid and when you don't get paid you\ncan't make rent that is not against the\nlaw\nso when a local government decides that\nthey do not want to utilize their money\ntime and resources to go after homeless\npeople\nwe should allow them to do what they\nfeel is best for their community\nOnce Upon a Time people in this chamber\ntook pride in home rule and local\ncontrol\nI'm not sure where those days have gone\nbut bills like this fly in the face that\nour local and duly elected governing\nbodies do not need the state\nlevel preempting their authority to\ngovern their communities accordingly\ninstead bills like this ones that\ncriminalize homelessness instead of\nbills like this that criminalize\nhomelessness we need bills that address\nthe root cause of homelessness\nthere are people in this state and I\nwant y'all to hear this because I think\na lot of times when we think of homeless\npeople as my colleague said when she was\nin the well you have a picture in your\nmind of who these homeless people are\nbut let me let me set the record\nstraight there are people in this state\nthat are working multiple jobs\nand even with that income they are\nbarely making ends meet\nthey find themselves a sick child away\nfrom not being able to make rent because\nif they miss work they don't get paid\nthere are people on the streets that are\nsuffering from mental health issues and\nusually the only option for them is in\nour jails that is literally where\nthey're getting their care\nthere are people in this state that work\nevery single day and then have to go\nsleep in a tent because they do not have\nanother option\nso where are the bills that increase\nwages\nwhere are the bills that would guarantee\npaid leave so that if you have to take\ncare of your sick baby you do not a lose\nyour job or be you have the means to\nstill pay your bills at the same time\nwhere are those bills\nwhere are the bills that ensure that\npeople have access to Affordable Health\nCare so they don't find themselves\nhomeless because of crippling medical\ndebt\ndo you know there are people that might\nfind themselves not being able to make\nrent or find themselves out of a home\nbecause they got a devastating medical\ndiagnosis that is very very expensive\nand they have to choose will I live or\nwill I will I find the money to pay\nthese medical bills or and live or will\nI die\nwhy would we be forcing law enforcement\nand prosecutors to lock up these people\ninstead of finding ways to just keep\nthese people off the street in the first\nplace\nI'm asking you all to look into your\nhearts and realize that homeless people\nare people\nI'll say that again because it's kind of\nloud and I want to make sure that\neverybody in the chamber heard what I\nsaid homeless people are people\nthey are human beings they are not trash\nThey Are Not Invisible\nthey are someone's mom\nsomeone's daughter\nsomeone's Uncle someone that someone\ncared about\nthey are veterans they are people\nsuffering with mental health issues they\nare people that are working in a job\nsomewhere\nthey are not just numbers and they are\nnot just dollars they are people\nwhen you vote today I hope that you will\nconsider their humanity and vote no on\nthis Bill thank you Mr Speaker I yo the\nwell\nthe lady has yielded the well that\ncompletes all of those that were opposed\nto SB 62 now we'll hear from those for\nup to\nup to 30 minutes that are in favor\nrepresenting Rick Townsend is recognized\nto speak to the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker\nI'm just going to speak for just a\ncouple of minutes uh it's not I'm not\ngoing to be long-winded or anything else\nI just want to talk a little about how\neffects Home Brunswick Georgia Glenn\nCounty Georgia\none of the things I like about this bill\nbased on\nmy community where I live it prohibits\nhospitals local governments local\nauthorities from dropping off the\nhomeless other than that the county of\nresidents reason I say that our local\nofficials our private Community are\nreally non-profits have joined together\nto help out the homeless in the area we\nhave numerous Services down there\nincluding the well\nit's a day shelter for homeless we have\nthe course of Salvation Army we have a\nMana house we serve meals every day\nwhich I volunteered in before and\nvisited the well quite a bit and had\ncontributed to help out as well\nwe're working together for this issue to\nhelp our community out we're having\ntrouble\nin Brunswick Georgia\nfrom others bringing people in and\ndropping them off because they heard we\nhave great Services we've been started a\nvillage for homeless veterans down there\nand so all I'm asking is\nwe're helping ourselves we're trying to\nhelp our community we're trying to take\ncare of the homeless down there\nthey're our brothers and sisters\nthey are people I totally amen all that\nI totally agree\nso let us help us let's we need to help\nourselves help our people help our\npopulation all we can and we'll do that\nand thank you and I yield the well\ngentlemen has yielded the well\nrepresentative Gaines is recognized to\nspeak to the bill\nthank thank you Mr Speaker and uh first\nwant to say thank you to chair Dempsey\nfor her great work on this measure I\nthink this is one of the most important\nbills that we'll see this session it's\nan issue that faces communities across\nour state and certainly in my district\nin Athens it's something that we've seen\nsignificant challenges with and and\nbelieve this bill is a big step forward\nin addressing that challenge there have\nbeen a lot of conversations from the\nwell so far and a lot of the things that\nwe've heard over the last several\nminutes relate to this issue but but are\ntotally unrelated to this bill and so I\nthink it's important that as we continue\nthis discussion and we wind down towards\nvoting on Senate Bill 62 that we\nconsider what's actually in this bill\nand what this bill will do it's a very\nsimple measure\nand the fir there's really three\nobjectives of it one is just saying that\nif you're a local governments need to\nenforce the laws that they have on the\nbooks it's that simple is if you have a\nif you have an ordinance or local uh\nlocal local ordinances that are on your\nbooks you have to enforce the laws that\nyou pass\nsecondly it's an audit of spending\nthat's that that we're spending at local\nstate and federal dollars on how we're\nspending related to homelessness and\nmaking sure that the spending that the\nentities are doing are is effective and\nthat's what the audit will get to the\nbottom of in addition it covers what\ntime and resource our law enforcement\nagencies are having to spend and talking\nto local law enforcement in Athens a\nsignificant portion of their time is\nspent related to homelessness\nhomelessness and so that's I think a\nreally important component of this bill\nis the audit of spending and then\nfinally what representative Townsend\njust talked through is is the the issue\nthat we've seen in Athens and I know he\ntalked about it in his community where\nother hospitals and other local\ngovernments are taking homeless\nindividuals and dropping them off in\nother communities where there's not been\nan agreement from a homeless shelter not\nbeen agreement from a family member to\naccept that individual it happened\nactually just a couple of weeks a weeks\nago in Athens and a business owner in\nour community called and shared what\nhappened to him on his doorstep in the\nmiddle of the day a homeless individual\nwas dropped off from a neighboring\nCounty and that's a real challenge for\nour community as representative town has\nshared the services that his district\nhas we certainly have those in Athens\nand it's not right for individuals it's\nnot right for that individual and it's\nnot right for the community for\nindividuals to just be dropped off and\nso that's what this bill will address\nand again just want to thank chair\nDempsey for her great leadership on this\non Senate Bill 62 and ask for the body's\nfavorable consideration Mr Speaker I\nyield the well\nthe gentleman has yielded well that\ncompletes the comments in favor of the\nproposition well let's see let's move on\nto is there any objection to the\nprevious question being ordered that\nJerry has done the previous question is\nordered we do have a Minority Report\nthat will have up to 20 minutes\nyou will all police yourselves on your\ntime\nrepresent Stacy Evans is recognized to\nspeak to the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker and colleagues I\nrise in opposition to Senate Bill 62 not\nbecause I don't think it has a good goal\nbehind it\nI applaud the lady who brought the bill\nI know her heart is in the right place\nand I know she wants to help\nI just think this is misguided\nI also don't want to be like Los Angeles\nI have no desire for that\nI've had frustrations just like many\nothers especially those of us who spend\nevery day and not just the first three\nmonths of the year in the city\nwith homelessness it's very frustrating\nand it's heart-wrenching because it is a\nreally hard difficult issue to deal with\none that can't be solved or pretended to\nbe understood\nwith a five-page bill written from above\nI own a home on Piedmont and fourth\nright and right straddles downtown in\nMidtown my husband and I use it as an\noffice house so we're not there a lot\nwe often come into the office and find\nvisitors on our porch and\nwe speak with law enforcement we work\nwith our neighbors trying to get\nresources for the individuals who find\nthemselves on our porch\nand there's no there's no solution it\nkeeps happening when I first got elected\nto the district that I represent now\nI was faced immediately with\nquestions from all of my neighborhoods\nalmost you got to do something about the\npeople sleeping under the underpasses\nyou got to do something about them\nso I talked to g-dot and I say what can\nwe do about the homelessness camps under\nthe underpasses how do we make sure\npeople get resources to be treated with\nthe dignity that they deserved how do we\nmove them toward resources to help them\nand how do we keep our neighborhoods\nsafe because we don't want\nthe things that sometimes come with\ngroups of people sleeping Outdoors that\nare not meant for human habitation\nit's hard what I'm told is it costs\nhundreds of thousands of dollars to move\npeople somewhere else\nand where do we move them\nand then they come back\nand then your do-gooder neighbors this\nis what I was told\nbring them blankets and bring them food\nbecause\nthey're human beings as has been said in\nthis well what else would the Lord have\nus do there but for the grace of God go\nI that's what we think and we want to\nhelp our neighbors So This is\ncomplicated\nand it begs for nuance the lady from\nDecatur\nbrought up the great Point what if you\nhave multiple counties and some\nunincorporated areas in some cities\nwhat's allowed under this bill and\nwhat's not we can't say that\nprosecutorial discretion has been\ndiscussed\nhow how could we tell the city of\nAtlanta that a lot of us in here have\nbeen you know saying or doing it the\nwrong way you're not prioritizing\nviolent crime now we're telling them\nthey've got to prioritize folks sleeping\non the street why do we have to control\neverything\nwhat if somebody came in here and asked\nus about our priorities\nhow would we like that other elected\nofficials telling us we're not doing it\nthe right way instead of passing and\nproposing glad we haven't passed it yet\ninstead of proposing a voucher Bill why\ndon't you rewrite the quality basic\neducation funding formula that hasn't\nbeen Rewritten since Joe Frank Harris\nwas governor before I started school\nsome people might have a problem with\nthat priority why are we relying on\ntoddlers to learn how to hide from\nactive Shooters instead of hearing gun\nsafety bills\nwhy are we not dealing with the fentanyl\ncrisis that we talked about this morning\nhow did that not become a priority\nladies and gentlemen\nhere's what I say\nand I'm talking to members of my own\nparty as much as anybody when I say this\nwhen people say why aren't you doing\nsomething about this why aren't you\ndoing that why can't you do more on this\nwin elections\nif you want to do something about the\ncity of Atlanta's homelessness situation\nhow about you move your butt to Atlanta\nand run for office\nhow about you get yourself elected to\nthe city council you want to say have a\nsay in what DA's and solicitors spend\ntheir time on\ngo get a law degree and run\nbut you let them do their job let's do\nour job because ladies and gentlemen\nthere's a lot that we can do from this\nbody to address homelessness\nwages\nlandlord tenant policies that haven't\nmade their way all the way across to the\ngovernor's desk we've got things that we\ncan do that nobody else can do DA's\ncan't do it City councils can't do it\nCounty commissions can't do it let's\nstop trying to do their job and do ours\nthank you Mr Speaker I yield the well\nthe lady has yielded the well represent\nrepresentative Willis is recognized to\nspeak to the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker\nI rise today in opposition to Senate\nbill 62.\nI'm certain that that comes as no\nsurprise\ncolleagues greetings\nI live in a district affected by\nhomelessness I live in the city of\nAtlanta\nI live in a district\nthat during the pandemic students sat in\nMcDonald's parking lots to get Wi-Fi to\ndo their homework I live in a district\nwhere this decision matters and I ask\nthat you consider what matters in the\ndistricts of your colleagues\nit was the best of times number one\nplace to do business\nit was the worst of times\nit was the age of wisdom and it was the\nage of foolishness\nit was the season of light and the\nseason of Darkness the spring of Hope\nand it was the season of Despair example\nin this the people's house we most\nagreeably salute our veterans we proudly\nstand daily during session to do so\nthanking them for their service as we\nshould and their sacrifice to this\ncountry yet according to the veterans\nadministration there are 725 veterans in\nthe state of Georgia living in the state\nof homelessness\n725 Heroes the Senate study committee on\nunsheltered homelessness released a\nfinal report with 26 findings and its\nrecommendations of these findings and\nrecommendations\n62 only implements one one\nmicromanaging jurisdictions does not\naddress the root causes of homelessness\nbut only manages again its symptoms if\nthe general assembly truly wants to help\nit would Instead address the affordable\nhousing crisis raise the minimum wage\nexpand Medicaid and increase the state\nfunding for the Department of Community\nAffairs\nwe have each made a commitment to solve\nfor issues and it is my hope that this\nbody would recognize when we have more\nwork to do and not rest with Senate Bill\n62. work with me toward a comprehensive\nsolution we promised Georgia that we\nwould fight for all of them including\nour homeless population I leave you with\nthese words by Robert Frost the woods\nare lovely dark and deep but I have\npromises to keep and miles to go before\nI sleep and miles to go before I sleep\nfor I have promises to keep and miles to\ngo before I sleep Mr Speaker I yield\nback the well\nlady has yielded well representing\nBarnes is recommended to speak\nrecognized to speak\nspeaker\ngood afternoon colleagues\nI stand today in opposition of SB 62.\nI'll start mine off with a story and\nI'll be really brief\nI represent house District 86 which\nencompasses\nTucker and a couple of other other\ncities that goes further south\nand Tucker the the\npart that I represented Tucker has a lot\nof Extended Stays hotels and I see a lot\nof homeless\naround that area on the streets on the\nsidewalk\nthis bill will take the jurisdiction\naway from the cities and put it in our\nhands and I believe Tucker knows the\nbest way to address Tucker's\nhomelessness problem\nso riding around in December when it was\nbelow freezing we had a big freeze here\nin Georgia and everyone in their right\nmind needed to be in the house\nI took it upon myself to ride around my\ndistrict and make sure that the homeless\nin my district knew where the shelters\nwere because it was inhumane to stay out\nin the cold at the time\nas I rode around and saw the homeless I\npulled over to give them blankets out of\nmy trunk or direct them to the shelters\nand many of them said they did not want\nto go to the shelters it was\nimperative for people to be inside\nduring this time because it was way\nbelow freezing and they still told me\nthey did not want to go to the shelter\nso that's not uh just a homelessness\nissue that is a mental health issue\nI couldn't drive them myself to the\nshelter because mentally they weren't\nprepared to understand that this is\nunhealthy to stay in these in this low\ntemperature\nso I asked that we oppose SB 62 and\nlet's focus on the mental health of\nthese people let's find other options uh\nthe the sidewalks are are not created\nequal believe it or not our sidewalks\nare not equal because there are some\ncommunities where the sidewalks are\nbarely used and a homeless person on the\nsidewalk would not be a problem to\nanybody it wouldn't be making a problem\nto anyone in other communities sidewalks\nthere aren't any sidewalks so where are\nthe people supposed to go and if we do\npass this bill we will be maybe\nexacerbating crime by taking them off\nthe sidewalks they're going to go to\nprivate properties to to to find a\nshelter and we don't want that so I ask\nthat we oppose this bill and come back\nto the table and try to come up with\nother Solutions rather than\ncriminalizing the homeless in our state\nthank you Mr Speaker I yield the well\nthe lady has yielded the well\nrepresentative Al Williams has\nrecognized to speak to the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker\nthis was not planned I've listened\nand I'm usually very joyful\nbut today I just come as a human being\nI've heard some interesting things that\nhave been said and I understand\nsometimes how the problem it is because\nI know I have been guilty\nof forgetting\nhuman beings\nit was a state senator Renee Kemp\nI mean I would go under the bridges\nand just hear some stories on what got\nyou here\nand what I've found\nand and and and and thank you\nrepresentative Townsend\nit's very interesting what you had to\nsay\nI've found that unfortunately\nthe vast majority of the people under\nthe bridges who we're talking about I\nthink this this is not these are not\neviction people these are people\nsometimes who's never had a house\nthese are chronically homeless people\nwho people have stopped looking at as\npeople\nand I found myself passing by there's no\nguy on Capitol Avenue I passed him by\nand one morning I was convicted and some\nof you know what I mean I turned around\nwent back and gave him something\nmy friend representative Mack Jackson\nkeeps\na bunch of envelopes\nthe scripture in them and some money\nunfortunately most of us have not done\nanything for those who are chronically\nhomeless\nand my only problem I have several but\nmy problem with where we are right now\nis I think we're ahead I think that\ninstead of a bill\nwe should be having a study committee\nwhere people can look at\nwhat's happening and try and design a\nway to help somebody\nnot to criminalize them the unfortunate\ntruth is\na great percentage of these folk are\nveterans\nand they have mental problems and most\npeople on those bridges have mental\nproblems these are not the shiftless\nthese are folk who have not gotten it\ntogether and have lost their way some of\nthem have had good careers and they just\ngot lost\nwe don't even be talking about how we\njail and we need to be talking about how\nwe're going to help them\ngot to figure out a way\nthe preacher said this morning and he\nwas great\nhe talked about help\nand how we pre-judge people and I kind\nof pre-judged him I didn't know he could\npreach like he was preaching he was\nDynamite I didn't think it was going to\nsay much Madame Pro Temp but he was one\nof the best\nthat did you do to the least of mine\nyou do also unto me\nthis is an issue that we need to take a\nlook at as a state as a bipartisan State\nand it hadn't got to be packed with a\nbunch of experts who think they have all\nthe answers it needs to be packed with\npeople who have compassion for other\npeople and want to find a solution to a\nproblem I'm from a little town called\nMidway folk I know the water tastes like\ncherry wine now most of you are not\nfortunate enough to live in Midway\nbut we have a few homeless in Hinesville\nit Grieves me when a person is fouled in\nVietnam in Iraq Afghanistan\ncome home\nand have lost their way and now they\nhave\na chance of being jailed\ncompassion\ntoo many fancy churches around don't\nwant folk who are dirty and out of place\neven walking on the sidewalk in front of\nthe church thank God for Central and it\ndoesn't look good but somebody got to\nfigure out how to help these people and\nhelping them is not putting them in jail\nhelping them is addressing the issue as\na state\nchronically I'm not talking about those\nwho won't pay their rent if they had the\nmoney I'm talking about those who are\nlost in a sea of depression\nand we owe it and if you don't pay it\nyou will pay it one day because that\nthat you do to the least of mine you do\nalso unto me\nthe gentleman has left the well\nrepresentative Bruce is recognized to\nspeak to the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker I too uh decided to\nmake these comments at the last minute\nbut as my colleague mentioned a moment\nago about us meeting with the governor\nseveral years ago this is not a new\nsubject for me\nand um it's it is personal you know a\nlot of times people you know they tell\nus don't come up here and make it\npersonal but it is personal when you see\nsomebody on the street and\num\nyou can't help them the way they need to\nbe helped this uh Senate Bill 62 is just\nanother hate-filled bill\nyou know people don't like to just be\ncandid but you got to be candid it's a\nhate-filled bill a bill to punish people\nfor helping people who need help\nthat is mean that's just not the right\nspirit for any of us here many of us\nin this room you may not want to admit\nit but some of you are probably one or\ntwo paychecks away from being homeless\nyourself\nyou know you we we nobody wakes up in\nthe morning and says I can't wait\nto get out\nin the rain\nI can't wait\nto get out\nwith no bathroom anywhere nearby\nI just want to sleep on the street\nnobody does that\npeople are on the street for all kinds\nof reasons and many of them you'll never\nunderstand if you've never been out on\nthe street yourself\nwhy do all of our bills everything we\nseem to do down here\nour bills are focused on punishing\nsomebody\nthey're focused on doing things to\nsomebody for doing something they're not\nfocused on how can we help\nand I think we need to start looking at\nit differently you know all you new\npeople that are here\nyou know think about changing the way we\ndo things here and focus on how do we\nhelp people instead of how do we hurt\npeople\nI know I'm running out of time I had a\nlot more I wanted to say but this thing\nreminds me of\ntwo movies\nthat came out\nyou know in years past\none was called Trading Places\nI don't know if you remember that movie\nwith Eddie Murphy\nyou know where they where two rich\npeople took a bet on whether they could\nchange\na a person on the street and get them\nwhere they could be a useful Citizen and\nthe other one was to get a rich person\nand put them on the street I don't know\nif you remember that movie but that that\nkind of is what it is you know we cannot\ntake the attitude that we can't help\nbecause we can in the other movie it was\nwhere those same two rich people were on\nthe street and a rich King came along\nand gave them a hand and they the the\nthe punch line was we're back you don't\nremember that that movie\nyou know it we we've got to reach out we\ngot to give a hand to people who need\nhelp\nand I'm getting a signal there\nthe bottom line to this in the words of\nmy seat mate\nyou know she she wanted me to make it\nclear\ngentlemen you have 30 seconds okay and\nI'm just going to end it with her with\nher statement\nthat we have to\nhelp people\nnot hurt people and we cannot make\npeople who are in need criminals thank\nyou very much Mr Speaker and I hear the\nwell\ngentlemen's yield of the well\nthat completes the Minority Report now\nwe'll move on to the chairs time\nthe chair at the committee that passes\nlegislation out\nchairman lahood\nspeak to the bill is recognized\nthank you Mr Speaker\nI'm going to make a few points and I'll\ngive the rest of my time to the sponsor\nof the bill but first I'd like to just\nstart and uh say that\nI've submit my entire professional\ncareer helping others serving others\nmany of the people that I've served my\nprofessional and personal life are\npeople who can't help themselves\nso I understand compassion\nthis bill the main premise of this bill\nis to\naudit\nthe funding that's been given to this\nissue\nLet's do an audit and let's see how the\neffect of the funding's been so that we\ncan know if we need to do more of that\nor do something different that's just\ntransparency to me\nthat makes sense\nit's been said that no one wants to be\nhomeless\nyou know I agree I don't think anybody\nwakes up one day and decides they want\nto be homeless and goes and chooses that\nbut I think there are people who are\nchoosing\num\nnot to do something different that can\nimprove their situation\ndid you know that approximately 50\npercent of the shelter beds in Atlanta\nare vacant\na couple of weeks ago a constituent of\nmine in Valdosta Georgia called me and\nsaid John this is a merchant who owns a\na store downtown Valdosta\nshe's about 75 years old and had this\ndoor there for about 20 years\nshe went to open the store one morning\nand there was a piece of cardboard\nlaying outside the door\nand she just thought to herself well\nthis looks bad\nin front of my store let me picked this\nup well she picked it up\nand somebody jumped up almost knocked\nher down\nand ran away as as he was you know just\nspewing profanities at her\nfor waking him up this was a 20 or 30\nsomething year old Caucasian male\nand it was very disturbing to her well\nuh he so he he left got out of sight so\nshe proceeded to clean up the the\ncardboard and other debris that had been\nplaced there uh\nsince she left closed the store the day\nbefore well she went down to get a bag\nand went to throw it away and realized\nthat she had picked up a bag of feces\nnow this isn't good for business\nand it's also not good for this young\nman who's sleeping outside under a piece\nof cardboard let's give him some help\nlet's do something this bill doesn't\nhave every single answer but it's a\nstart\nto me that's compassion\nwe don't we want to be sure that the\ncities in this state don't become like\nLos Angeles and Austin Texas where we\nencourage people\nto sleeping on the street\nlet's do something about it let's let's\nstart the process and um and gain more\nclarity on what's Happening so we'll\nknow what to do and do better\nwe're not criminalizing poverty\nwe're looking for Solutions Mr Speaker\nI'd like to yield the rest of my time to\nthe sponsor of the bill\nDempsey is recognized to speak the bill\nand take the remaining time or as much\nas she deems necessary\nthank you Mr Speaker I want to say thank\nyou to everybody\nthere is a seriousness in this room that\nI can feel this matters\nit matters in different ways to all of\nus and I respect you for that I don't\nalways have to agree to still offer my\nrespect to your viewpoints and what you\nare thinking\nthere have been a lot of assumptions\nmade I want to say first of all I have\nhomeless people in my community Rome is\nnot that small\nwe all have them some are more visible\nthan others but they are everywhere it\nis a pervasive problem and that is what\nthis measure is about\nmany of the things that have been stated\nhere this afternoon are way off of\nanything that is in this bill\nit does not address those measures\nintentionally this is not to solve\nhomelessness it is to help our get our\nhands our eyes our brains around it and\nunderstand the true challenge we spend\nhundreds of millions of dollars you have\ndone it in the amended budget you will\ndo it here again shortly to address many\nof the things that each of you have\nbrought up as concerns that is not\nspecifically what we are trying to do\nhere we're going to continue to respect\nthat spending and we want to make sure\nwe do it with accountable responsibility\nand every opportunity that we have I\nwant to make one thing clear too before\nI say a few more things this measure\npassed in the Senate and one of the most\nunique votes I've ever seen every single\nmember was on the floor when I started\nlooking that doesn't happen all that\noften every single person voted on it\nit passed 49 to 7. one Republican voted\nagainst it and six Democrats this\nmeasure passed over there with that this\nis a non-partisan humanitarian caring\nBill and nothing else\nthere's been said that it would\ncriminalize homelessness that's not what\nit is it is not about poverty it is not\nabout criminalizing homelessness is it\nabout the reality of understanding the\ncircumstances that we are in across our\nstate and the resources we have to look\nat it this bill is not even in the\ncriminal code look at the code sections\nplease\nit's title 36 Title 31 title 50. this is\nabout local government this is about\nhealth\nthis is not and about the state\ngovernment excuse me it is not criminal\nimplications for this at all\nthis is about absolutely acting with\nyour heart\nit opens the door for us to do more it\nopens the door for us to do some of the\nthings that you have talked about\nwhether it is the minimum wage or Better\nHealth Care\nleave whatever it may be supportive\nhousing is the number one thing we have\nbut we cannot afford to have enough\nSupportive Housing opportunities for all\nof the homeless people in our state so\nwhat are the steps we can do to\nunderstand who they are where they are\nwhat their needs are yes there's no\ndoubt there's compounding mental health\nfor 12 years I have chaired that portion\nof the budget\nI know what I'm talking about I'm not\ntrying to be\nin any way\nblameful I'm not trying to pick on\nanyone neither have any of the members\nof my committee each and every time we\nlook at the budget and we figure out how\nmuch can we come up with to go into\nmental health into addiction into\ndevelopmental disabilities\ninto matters that affect many of the\nreasons why certain people today\nfind themselves without a stable housing\nopportunity\nwe need to know what it is so we can\naddress it\nI know I was asked about line 44-46 all\nthat that does and makes is make it\nclear that a municipality cannot adopt\nor enforce a written policy to not\nenforce their existing existing\nordinance it does nothing more than that\nthey must do it if you have it you must\ndo it we're not saying you have to have\nit\nit's up to that Community to decide if\nthey should have it\nalso I want to address another concern\nthat I think is pretty much on the minds\nof many and I will ask you to look at\nline 75 through 76.\nthat talks about where no County or\nMunicipal corporation political\nsubdivision local Authority or other\nlocal government units shall drop off\nnow let's talk about what dropping off\nis\nknown to be a homeless individual\noutside of its jurisdiction here's the\nbig word unless\nlook at that unless there are two\nexceptions that matter\nsuch drop off is in the county where\nthat homeless person was a resident\nprior to coming under the custody\ncontroller care of a receiving\nor receiving treatment from such local\ngovernment or authority or or please\nhear this now that drop-off is at a\nfacility with a person business or\norganization that has agreed to accept\nthat individual we are talking about\nopening the door and dropping someone\noff on the street with no resources\nthat's what this measure stops you\ncannot go to your neighboring county and\nsay just because we have so many we're\ngoing to share this person with you\nor just because this is such a constant\nchallenge we're going to share we need\nthat help that's not what it does the\nbill is very plain very straightforward\nas I said for a very complicated\npassionate and deservingly compassionate\nreason\nas I said I do have homeless people I do\ncare greatly about this I've worked on\nit for years nothing has come from above\nit has come from here it's come from\nhere it's come from here it's come from\nlistening it's come from the people that\ncome before my committee and talk when\nwe are in subcommittee I asked for a\nstudy committee on this the senate had\none I've listened to everything they\nheard this is not intended to solve it\nit is intended to help us get a start on\nunderstanding what we can do and in the\nmeantime while we're trying to do that\nto not let others invade our own\ncommunities to play fair\nlet's all pick up and take care of all\nthe people that we can the goal is yes\nto get everyone into a much better\nsituation than this\nbut we have to walk and the reality of\nthe massive challenge that we are facing\nnow it's not just driving away from here\nlike I said it's every rural community\nyou will go to Community Kitchens you\nwill go to shelters you will go to\nchurches all over this state that\nrealize the challenge and that want with\nall of their heart to make it better and\nwe owe it to them\nto come forward and to help so if you\ntruly genuinely care about not seeing\nsomeone\nlike chairman Hood said where you think\nit's just cardboard but actually there's\na person under there if you truly think\nthat it's okay to put a tent up when\nit's almost 100 degrees or almost 10\ndegrees in Georgia\nthen you should absolutely vote to not\ndo this\nif you want to address the concerns not\nfix them all but begin to understand\nthem all\nand help your own Community do that then\nI ask you to vote Yes this is not a\npartisan issue it is a very heartfelt\nissue\nMr Speaker I feel like people have made\nup their minds so I'm going to ask now\nto yield the well I know there's times\nfor parliamentary questions as we leave\nthis\nbut I would ask you all to think very\nseriously and to help us help so that\nnext year when we come back\nand we start on the budget again we have\nsome more facts and we're better\nequipped and we're ready to do it thank\nyou Mr Speaker I yield the well\nthe lady has yielded the well\nfor what purpose does leader Beverly\nrise\nMr Speaker move to table SB 62. is

what purpose is representing Bernal\nrise\nparliamentary inquiry staging inquiry\nMr Speaker is it not true that the money\nthat we're talking about auditing is the\nmoney from the federal government that\nthe state does not give any money for\nhomelessness\nI'm sure the lady believes in what she\nspeaks\nI'm going to take a couple more we've\ndebated this issue for a long time this\nafternoon I want to recognize for what\npurposes representative Roberts rise\nparliamentary inquiry State your inquiry\nisn't it true that this bill allows the\nAttorney General to sue our cities and\ncounties for prioritizing their often\nlimited resources to address violent\ncrime over homelessness and recover from\nthose County and City taxpayers the AGS\nlitigation expenses including attorneys\nfees which we have no idea what his\nbillable rate is going to be\ninvestigative costs witness fees and is\nit further true that this micromanaging\nof our cities and counties is only going\nto hurt the people of Georgia and will\ndesperately impact the Metro Atlanta\njurisdictions where homelessness is more\nprevalent\nI'm sure this ladies so states she was\nhad a very well thought out\nparliamentary inquiry\nso let's see for what purpose does\nrepresentative chair lady Houston rise\nis isn't it not true that I live in a\nroom is this a parliamentary inquiry\nparliamentary inquiry yes ma'am State's\ninquiry isn't it not true that I live in\na rural area where people have to go to\nMcDonald's the library if they want to\nget Wi-Fi\nand isn't it not true that I have a\nhomeless camp\nabout uh I'd say 400 feet from where I\nlive\nand isn't it not true that uh I have\nbeen working to get something done about\nthe homeless count and I am\nso excited that we're going to order\ndifferent monies that come into this\nstate because I want my homeless people\nin my district to get every cent they're\ndue for and isn't it not true yes ma'am\nthat if the federal government does\naudit it I hope they do a lot better job\nauditing the homeless than they did on\nthe Workforce Development and if anybody\nhas had any experience with the auditing\nthey've done they would want the state\nto do the auditing thank you Mr Speaker\nI'm sure you're probably inquiry is well\nthought out too and I know the lady does\nhave a big heart and I know that's to be\ntrue\nI'm gonna take two more\nfor what purpose does representative\nmain arise\nparliamentary inquiry Mr Speaker State\nyour inquiry is it not true that this\nbill although it does make some prohibit\nprohibitions on local ordinances it does\nnot necessarily change how police\nofficers will police meaning if they are\nhomeless on the street if a police\nofficer does not arrest them which\nthey're not doing now this bill is not\ngoing to all of a sudden make police\nofficers arrest homeless and\nadditionally Mr Speaker\nAugust 2022 last year Governor Kemp did\ndistribute 62 million dollars of federal\nfunds for homelessness but for my\ndistrict the city of Atlanta the state\ngave nearly one million dollars to\nhomeless programs but I have no way of\nknowing where that nearly one million\ndollars went to but with this bill I can\nat least see the audit to know where\nthat million dollars went to is that not\ntrue\nsounds true to me at the lady so States\ntwo more\nwhat purposes representing Vermont rise\nparliamentary inquiry please State your\ninquiry thank you Mr Speaker is it not\ntrue that although the auditing\ncomponent of this bill is incredibly\nimportant there are other portions of\nthis bill that the speakers opposing\nthis bill have spoken to particularly\nregarding criminalizing homelessness\nbecause at the end of the day if you\nknow that the Attorney General is going\nto step in and prosecute a case that\nthey believe you should have prosecuted\nand you don't want to spend the money on\nthat you're going to be incentivized to\nprosecute that case particularly as it\nrelates to homelessness\nif the lady so States\nfor what purpose does chairman Knight\nRise\nparliamentary stage inquiry isn't it\ntrue Mr Speaker that Griffin Spalding\nCounty\nis the subject to The Dumping if you\nwill that was mentioned in the prior\nspeaker in the bills\nfurther State further inquiry further\ninquiry Mr Speaker isn't it true that\nmany counties surrounding us\nincluding Henry Clayton and other\ncounties are bringing homeless to\nSpalding County and is creating\na Havoc is creating crime and is one of\nthe most uh the biggest issues that our\nlocals have come and spoken to its local\ndelegation about\nif the gentleman slows States\nhave all members voted if so the clerk\nwill will lock the machine\non the

fiscal to Georgia annotated\nrelating the general Provisions\nregarding Prosecuting attorneys so as to\ncreate the prosecuting attorney's\noversight commission as Bill Evans refer\nto the committee on Judiciary non-civil\nthat committee recommends that this bill\ndo pass by committee substitute\nthe gentleman from the 19th house\nDistrict representative gullet is\nrecognized to present the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker\nthis is I rise today to present house\nbill I mean sorry Senate Bill 92 this is\nsomething that we've passed a number of\ntimes in this body in the last\ntwo years I think this is the fifth vote\non the house floor for this bill\nwhat this does is create a a prosecuting\nattorney's qualifications Commission uh\nwe used to call it prosecuting\nattorney's oversight commission but it's\na qualifications Commission\num and it's the bill is very similar to\nwhat our bill was house bill 231.\num the commission will be made up of\nfive members just like before three\nmembers five members of an investigative\npanel three members of a hearing panel\nagain the investigative panel is\nresponsible for the investigative\nprosecutorial and administrative\nfunctions of the commission hearing\npanels responsible for adjudicating\nformal charges filed by the\ninvestigative panel issuing disciplinary\nand incapacity orders issuing formal\nadvisory opinions issuing standards of\nthe commission\nwe have grounds for removal and it's\nvery Nero\num and if there's a complaint there must\nbe a sworn affidavit detailing the\npersonal knowledge of the facts\num supporting the complaint\nif there's disciplinary action that can\nbe appealed to the superior court of the\ncounty where the district attorney or\nsolicitor general served\nAdditionally the bill adjusts the duties\nof the D.A and solicitors to include\nreviewing each and every individual case\nfor which probable cause exists\nand make a prosecutorial decision based\non the cases specific facts and\ncircumstances\nthat's what this bill does I'm happy to\nanswer any questions I know again this\nis the fifth time we voted on it in the\nlast two years the second time this year\nso I can answer any questions Mr Speaker\ngentleman has a question a few Yules I\nwill representative Roberts right out in\nfront of you to your left thank you Mr\nSpeaker will the gentleman yield I will\nor do you know if the sponsor of this\nbill filed a fiscal note with this bill\nthis term\num I don't know that from I don't know\nif Senator Robertson filed a fiscal note\nfor this term no I do not know okay\nthank you\nto your left representative Jasmine\nClark has a question ladies recognized\nthank you Mr Speaker just gentleman\nyield I do you kind of glossed over it\nso I just want to be clear what exactly\nare the terms in which a prosecutor or a\nsolicitor general could be removed under\nthis\num so it starts at line 197. it's a\nmental or physical incapacity\ninterfering with the performance of his\nor her duties which is or is likely to\nbecome permanent willful misconduct in\noffice willful and persistent failure to\nperform his or her duties as described\nby law\nconviction of a crime involving moral\nturpitude\nconduct prejudicial to the\nadministration of justice which brings\nthe officer to disrepute and knowingly\nauthorizing or permitting an ADA or\nassistant sister\nGeneral to commit commit any act\nconstituting grounds for removal\ndid you turn my further yield I will all\nright so um I appreciate you laying\nthose out um that in my opinion is not\nvery narrow because some of this feels\nlike it could be broad is this based on\nWhose interpretation so as far as like\num willful and persistent failure to\ncarry out duties does that include not\nwanting to prosecute certain things\nbecause maybe they just don't have the\ncapacity or like who decides what's\nwillful and persistent failure to carry\nout their duties yeah so the commission\nwill write those rules and decide what\nthat is and then if there's an appeal\nbecause I didn't like it a superior\ncourt and like and from on there the\nAppellate Court and Supreme Court rule\nwill decide what that is thank you\ngentlemen yield representative nilowitz\nto your left has a question okay thank\nyou to the gentleman yield sure can you\ngive us a little more elimination into\nwhat exactly comprises moral turpitude\nmore turpitude so I think that's when\nyou do uh\nimmoral acts I think that there are like\nsexual harassment I think would fall\ninto that\num but I'm you know you probably know\ndid you tell me what you think moral for\npeople actually don't this is this is a\ngenuine question because it's it's it's\nit's a phrase that pops up sure\nthroughout zero to code but I haven't\nbeen able to find a clear definition to\nwhat exactly moral turpitude is it\nreminds me of that Supreme Court Justice\nsaying well you know I don't want to say\nit sure yeah but I didn't know if we\nactually had a definition or if it's\nsomething that\nif the gentleman further yields we could\njust say\nJacquees moral turpitude\nI don't know what that means but yeah um\nso\ntoo sounds French\ngentleman has one more question I'll\nyield for one more\nchairman Collins right straight up the\ncenter Isle has a question recognize for\na question chairman this gentleman yield\nI do\nto my friend in the world was it not\ntrue that I'm going to be supporting\nthis bill because when I was mayor of my\nlittle Community we had a portion of a\ncounty where the DEA acted like the\nsouth end of a Northbound mu a lot of\ntimes and he ultimately wound up\nresigning and had a non-prosecution\nprosecution agreement with the gbi and\nbecause of if we had a legislation like\nthis in place\nwas not true that he would have probably\nbeen removed from office long before the\ngbi ever got him is that not true\nthat I believe I believe to speak the\ntruth that this is something that I'm\nalso supporting because I had a district\nattorney who continued to sex the\narrests one of his one of his employees\nand um it brought the office into\ndistribute no one trusted the judicial\nsystem in my county and the only reason\nhe got caught was because he lied to\ndeposition about something else and so\nit caused a lot of problems for\ncommunities who have DA's who do this\nmost DA's are good but the ones that are\nbad this gives them a tool with that Mr\nSpeaker I appreciate the time and the\nconsideration of this body and I yield\nthe well\ngentleman has yielded the well\nwe have speakers in favor and opposed to\nthis proposition\nwe will allow up to 30 minutes for each\nopinion so we'll start with\nrepresentative Tanya Miller to speak to\nthe mill the representative is\nrecognized ladies and gentlemen lady\nwill suspend just for a moment before we\nbegin\nforeign\ngive the lady in your world your\nattention\nlady will proceed\nthank you Mr Speaker\num good afternoon colleagues I rise\ntoday to speak in opposition to SB 92 we\nhave vetted\num the versions of these prosecutor\nbills uh quite thoroughly so I will not\nbelabor points that have already been\nmade and I will tell you that when I ran\nfor this seat\num\nand vowed to represent and support and\nfight for malign minority groups in the\nstate I did not anticipate that that\nmight be prosecutors or elected DA's but\nsadly it seems that that is a place that\nwe are at\nI will say this quickly this bill is not\nonly\nunnecessary it undermines democracy by\nsilencing local voices while really\ndoing nothing at all to make our\ncommunity safer or to remove violent\ncriminals from our streets which is\nreally really really important work\nit is really the kind of thing we should\nbe most focused on when we are talking\nabout Public Safety in Atlanta alone in\n2022\n170 of our citizens were killed by gun\nviolence 85 of those were children\nwe ought to really be focused in on the\nthings that will make our communities\nsafer and of course this just simply is\nnot one of them\ninstead some have argued\nthat this is a power grab by the\nmajority party to usurp\nthe will of the voters\nby putting this body in the business of\noverseeing duly elected prosecutors\nthroughout our state\nthis will make us an outlier State as\nthe vast majority of states in our Union\nincluding southern states do not have\nsuch a commission\nthere were only three that I'm aware of\nIndiana Connecticut and New York\nfor decades we have coexisted and even\nexalted the work of prosecutors\nthey were not our enemies\nand we would be remiss if we did not\naddress therefore the elephant in the\nroom\nthat there were 14 newly elected\nminority district attorneys in this\nstate since 2020.\nand they in fact represent between their\ndistricts the majority of this state's\npopulation\nwhether intended or not this\nextraordinary measure will be viewed by\nthe world as a reaction to this\nthat simply should not be who we are in\nGeorgia nor should it be the impression\nthat we signal to the world make no\nmistake this is not a public safety bill\nit is as many have criticized including\nour elected District Attorneys a\npolitical weapon\nweaponized against someone else's chosen\nprosecutor today\nand perhaps your chosen prosecutor\ntomorrow\nif SB 92 passes it will grow state\ngovernment by Paving the way for\npolitically motivated oversight\nthat is because the folks who do the\nappointments are politicians\nthose will be those individuals who will\nhave power under this board\nwill be able to remove locally elected\nDA's and solicitors from office\nthe party and Power in the state of\nGeorgia whether it is Democratic or\nrepublican should not be engaged in the\nbusiness of usurping the will of the\nPeople by creating such a politically\npotentially politically motivated\ncommission funded by taxpayer dollars\n50 DA's\n50.\nthe vast majority of which are honest\ndedicated public servants we are\nactually prepared today to spend upwards\nof seven figures\nof taxpayer dollars\nto create a commission that we are\nalready well eclipped equipped to handle\nto deal with a problem that we are\nalready well equipped to handle it is a\ncommission simply put we do not need\nwe have processes in place to deal with\nWayward prosecutors every Wayward\nprosecutor that has been brought up\nas motivating this bill have already\nbeen dealt with by the processes we have\nin place\nthe Attorney General can of course\nindict any prosecutor who violates his\noath of office a far more streamlined\nprocess\nthose folks can then be removed by our\ngovernor immediately upon indictment\nyou can recall DA's who commit who\ncommit violations of their oath of\noffice or misconduct you can bring them\nliterally before the voters as a result\nof their violations or misconduct they\nare subject to Bar rules that govern\nlawyers and can be subject to disbarment\nfor violation of their ethical duties\na disbar D.A cannot practice law\nthis body of course has the\nConstitutional power to impeach\nDistrict Attorneys I've heard that\nalthough we have the power it is\nenshrined in our constitution it's\nsomething that we haven't done in a long\ntime and therefore it makes sense to\nspend upwards of a million dollars in\ntaxpayer Monies to create\na commission with a process that will be\ncumbersome that will not be streamlined\nthat will drag on and on as Appeals\nand arguments are made by their lawyers\nall of this pulling DA's from their ever\nimportant job of keeping us safe and\nbeing focused on that\nand lastly every four years every\nelected district attorney has a\nreferendum\nand if they have failed the people the\npeople will send them home packing\nnow we have heard some of us in our\ncommittees have heard prosecutors and\nLaw Enforcement Officers talk about the\nchallenge of recruiting and maintaining\ntalent and our ever important field of\nPublic Safety\nthis bill will exacerbate the problem by\ncreating a mechanism whereby any person\na person not even in the prosecutor's\nDistrict not even a taxpayer a victim\nnot even someone from the state of\nGeorgia\ncan file a complaint against a\nprosecutor requiring that district\nattorney to take their eyes off the\nwheels of Public Safety and crime\nfighting to hire a lawyer and prepare\nresponses and defenses to a commission's\ninquiry that's right\nthe way that this bill is drafted\nsomeone in California can file a\ncomplaint against a district attorney in\nGeorgia\nthat might require that district\nattorney to take their hands off the\nwheel of doing the work that their\ncommunities have sent them there to do\nto answer to inquiries to hire a lawyer\nto not be focused on the critical things\nthat have sent them to office\nnow I have heard as I as I wrap up\nI've heard a lot from my friends across\nthe aisle\nabout the importance of local government\ncontrol\nfor instance voters in one County may\nnot favor electing a D.A who believes\nthat accountability courts are a proper\nmeans of justice for drug crimes or\nnon-violent felonies whereas voters in\nanother jurisdiction May support a D.A\nwho believes that is the best option to\nredress certain violations\nbut in neither case in neither case\nshould we substitute our judgment for\nthat of local voters\nask yourself as you press your button\nif you really believe it's a good idea\nfor the political party in power\nwhichever party that may be\nto have the ability\nto overtake and usurp the will of Voters\nevery Community is unique local\nprosecutors and local voters know the\nneeds of their communities better than\nwe do\nalso it is a frightening proposition it\nshould be\nto place oversight over prosecutors in\nthe hands of electives who can and do\nsometimes wield their power for\npolitical purposes\nthe political platform of my colleagues\nthe party in charge currently States\nquote we believe that our constitutional\nsystem of limited government separation\nof powers federalism and the rights of\npeople must be preserved uncompromised\nfor future Generations\nSB 92 violates this standard while\nunnecessarily growing government by\ncreating this massive expensive\nduplicative mandate\nand as the Forsyth County solicitor Bill\nFinch said during our Committee hearing\nthis bill doesn't pass the bar for GOP\nstandards which are quote limited\ngovernment local control fiscal\nresponsibility and respect\nfor The Ballot Box\nI challenge my colleagues who are\nsupporting this bill to instead trust\nvoters\nand support local prosecutors by making\nsure they have the tools the training\nand the funding to do their jobs to\nactually be about the work of making our\ncommunity safer thank you Mr Speaker I\nyield\na lady has yielded the well\nrepresentative Yasmine Neal is\nrecognized to speak to the bill\nthank you Mr speaker thank you\ncolleagues I rise today\nto oppose Senate bill 92.\nwe have been here before and I don't\nwant to delay with a point but like I\nmentioned prior before we move forward\nwith this measure we really\nneed to\nI really encourage those that desire to\naddress problematic prosecutors to\nexhaust the means that we currently have\nbecause as was testified in committee\nall options have not been exhausted\nthe State Bar\nthe AG bringing charges\nvoters voting out problematic\nprosecutors and bringing articles of\nimpeachment to this body which as we've\ntestified before has not been done since\nthe 1960s\nwhy not try that why not try something\nthat we haven't done in over 50 plus\nyears because it just might work let's\nexhaust all of our options first\nand based on the testimony that was\nbrought before our committee most of the\nproblematic prosecutors have been\nremoved or voted out\nthe citizens did their job the people\nthat became problems they voted them out\nso before we ask taxpayers\nto pay for yet another process\nwe should exhaust current options\nso with that join me in Saving taxpayer\ndollars in opposing Senate bill 92. and\nMr Speaker I yield the well\nthe lady has yielded the well\nthat concludes remarks of those opposed\nto sb99 our\nrecognize representing Maynor to speak\nto the bill\nrepresentative Maynard\nthere are three folks signed up to speak\nto the bill\ny'all will have to manage your own time\nrepresentative Manor\nthank you Mr Speaker this is going to be\nreally quick because we did talk about\nthis already\nI want to just speak from the voice of a\ncitizen or citizens\nthere are many different things that you\ncan do if you are having trouble with\nthe prosecutor but as a citizen does not\nnecessarily it's not necessarily easy\nfor a citizen so the things that were\nmentioned Chris Carr can prosecute\nattorney general Chris Carr can\nprosecute well first it has to be a\ncrime which means local police would\nhave to investigate the D.A which\nthey're not going to do in order for\ntheir to be a crime for attorney general\nChris Carr to look into that the second\nthing with that is\nsomeone mentioned you can do a bar\ncomplaint\ncitizens I've done a bar complaint it's\nnot an easy thing to do a barking plane\nyou have to go through hundreds of pages\nto try to understand as a non-lawyer\nwhat is the codes that you believe the\nattorney has violated that is not easy\nfor a lay citizen to do so that really\nis not an option you mentioned a\nreferendum\nreferendums are not necessarily easy\nespecially if it's in a community where\nit's high poverty low graduation rates\num\nfood deserts and the sort the knowledge\nbase there to Galvanize and do a\nreferendum that is just not something\nthat is done in communities where\nthey've never even heard of a referendum\nsometimes another thing that someone\nmentioned is impeaching\nthis since I have been here what I have\nlearned is that elected officials\nstick with elected officials it's like a\ncamaraderie we are we are all\nfamily here but we also know that we're\nup here at the state to do a job\nsometimes at other local levels of\ngovernment\nthere is a code where people will turn\nthe other cheek if they see a comrade\ndoing something that they should not be\ndoing\nI am voting yes for SB 92\nbecause they are citizens that have\ncontacted me that have problems with\nprosecutors\nwe have our ethics board that is our\noversight judges they have their\noversight board school boards they have\nan oversight board\nformer president Donald Trump he had the\nJanuary 6\ncommittee\nprosecutors don't have that so why it is\na bad thing for someone to give\noversight to someone\nthe only person people that do not like\nthat are the prosecutors but what about\nthe citizens has anybody had a phone\ncall from citizens that said my\nprosecutor didn't do this my prosecutor\ndidn't do this the last time I was up\nhere in the well I mentioned about\n10 or 15 different people\nfamilies that lost loved ones to police\nviolence that prosecutors did not\nprosecute\nlet's give at least those people those\nfamilies an opportunity\nto get Justice thank you I yield the\nwill\nthe lady has yielded the well\nrepresentative Gaines is recognized to\nspeak to the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker like the speakers\nbefore I'll be brief because I know we\nhave talked about this issue before this\nsession but also in previous sessions\nand again want to thank representative\ngullet for his great leadership bringing\nthis bill forward and the house house\nbill 231 Senator Robertson Senate Bill\n92 and getting us to this point and I'm\nexcited and looking forward to us\ngetting this bill over the finish line\nhere today I do want to respond to a\ncouple comments have been brought\nforward the first comment that that\nfrankly I found outrageous was that this\nbill was brought as a result of minority\ncandidates being elected across the\nstate\nthis bill was brought because we have\nDistrict Attorneys and prosecutors who\naren't doing their job I told you all\nlast time this bill was on the house\nfloor House Bill 231 about the district\nattorney in the Western Judicial Circuit\nand the issues that we've had in\nAthens-Clarke County and Oconee County\nwell since then just a couple weeks ago\nthere have been more issues brought\nforward about our district attorney\nthere was even a rid of mandamus filed\nin court trying to get her to Simply do\nher job\nas part of that rid of mandamus there\nwas additional evidence brought forward\nI already told you about the letter from\nour four Superior Court judges simply\nasking her to show up to court and do\nher job we also have a letter from a\npolice officer where he expressed to her\nhis absolute disgust with her\nperformance in a case\nso the judges the law enforcement\nofficers the community lawyers\nthere's an issue after issue after issue\nnow 35 prosecutors have resigned from\nthat office that's the equivalent of\nevery every single position that office\nresigning twice over the last two years\n35 resignations that we've seen so the\nother comment to wrap this up that I\nheard was this is this bill was not\nbrought for Public Safety that's the\nwhole point of this bill is to restore\nPublic Safety in places where you have\nRogue District Attorneys who simply are\nnot doing their job that's what we've\nseen the Western Judicial Circuit it's\nhappening in other places throughout\nthis state and I think Senate Bill 92 is\none of the most important measures we\ncan pass this session look forward to\ngetting over the finish line Thank you\nMr Speaker I yield the well\ngentleman has yielded the well\nwe do have a minority report for up to\n20 minutes\nrepresent darshan Kendrick is recognized\nto present The Minority Report\nand then allocate the time with the\nother speakers\nthank you Mr Speaker\npromise when I say it when I got my\nvoice back that you will hear more from\nme so here we go we're here again\nI Rose to speak out against HB 231 and\nwe're here again discussing the\nprosecutorial overthrow Bill SB 92. and\nI cannot for the life of me understand\nwhy we have other elected officials\nother constitutional officials in this\nstate if all we're going to do is\ncontinue to tell them how to do their\njob\none of the things that I hate as a\nbusiness owner and most of you in here\nare business owners is micromanagers\nyou know those people that get in the\nway of you during your job because you\nbelieve your way is the only way\nbut I present to you that we have become\na hundred and eighty Micro Managers for\nthe 49 DA's in the state of Georgia\nI don't understand this so this is what\nI propose a legislative qualifications\nCommission\nand this commission shall have the power\nto discipline remove and cause\ninvoluntary retirement of legislators\njust like this bill does\nbut we're duly elected officials you say\nso are the DA's and the solicitor\nGenerals in this bill\nbut sometimes you say you decide not to\nsign on to a bill because that's within\nyour discretion right\nsame is the case for DA's that have\ncertain fact patterns that you don't\nhave\nbut you say we have the ethics\ncommission but they can't remove us like\nthe several entities we already have to\nremove DA's and solicitor generals and\nwe all know at least a few legislators\nthat can benefit from some chastisement\nor removal\nso who's going to sign on to my\nlegislative qualifications commission's\nBill anybody who's supporting this bill\nall that SB 92 is doing is killing a fly\nwith a bazooka because you have a few\nDA's and you want to get them out of\noffice\nthere are so many more already existing\nways to get rid of them\nbut instead of using what we already\nhave in our toolkit we make another\nunnecessary expensive and arbitrary law\nSo to that end I don't ever want to hear\nthe following buzzwords from the\nsupporters of this bill number one\nsmall government\nthis bill creates more layers of\ngovernment at a price tag that is going\nto be at least one million dollars so I\ndon't ever want to hear about small\ngovernment\ntwo local control\nthis is legislative control of the\nlocals a textbook example so that's a\nword I don't ever want to hear again and\nthird Criminal Justice Reform the only\nreform that is going on is telling DA's\nand solicitor generals how to do their\njob regardless of the facts of the case\nso I leave you with this\nour only legislative responsibility is\nto pass the budget that's it not to pass\nunnecessary laws so I urge each and\nevery one of you to consider voting no\nto SB 92. thank you Mr Speaker\nthe lady has yielded the well\nrepresenting Stacy Evans is recognized\nto speak to the bill\nspeaker and hello again colleagues\nwe heard that this is going to be the\nfifth time that we voted on this bill\nwhich means that at least five times\nthis bill has had changes just on this\nside and I'm sure there's been more\nbecause\nI know what it's like to be in a\nJudiciary Committee and things change\nand changed again and changed again so\nwho knows how many times\nand I bring that up because maybe\nthere's a reason\nthis doesn't make it all the way across\nmaybe there's a reason five times I\ncan't think of anything\nand I'm not saying there's not but I was\ntrying to think this morning has there\never been anything that I've voted on\nfive times\nI can't I can't think of anything y'all\nwill come to my desk and tell me later\nif I'm forgetting something but maybe\nthere's a reason\none of those reasons is that this is\nprobably not a priority for very many of\nyou\nI I'm I'm certain that's true we've\nheard stories so far I think of three\nDA's that folks seem to have problems\nwith\none\nthe D.A that mishandled to say the least\nthe Ahmad Aubry decision\ngone\nthank you voters\nthe situation I believe somewhere in\nMiddle West Georgia\nremoved\ndelayed only because RDA I mean our uh\nattorney general didn't stand in the\npower he had to do something about it\nsooner the governor stepped in got that\ntaken care of so that leaves one that\nwe've heard about in Athens\nthat D.A I'm not going to talk about\nthat individual situation that's not my\nbusiness for a number of reasons\nbut that dla was elected in 2020.\nwe're standing here in almost April of\n2023.\nit's a non-partisan elected official\nthat means that person is up for\nelection in May of 2024.\na little over a year from now\nhow about we let the voters decide\neven under this bill\nthe first time somebody can file a\ncomplaint against somebody is October\n2024.\nso the voters can deal with it before\nthis commission can\nbut let's talk a little bit about the\nmechanics of what changed because I know\nI've been up here before this session\nsecond time about this bill counting\nother other sessions so you've heard\nfrom me a lot on this\none of the changes is that now the\nappointments for the members of this\ncommission instead of being made by the\nmembers of the Georgia Supreme Court\nwhich is what we had in our version that\npassed out of here now\nthe individual members are all going to\nbe appointed by partisan elected\nofficials The Usual Suspects Governor\nlieutenant governor Speaker of the House\nbut there's one category that stood out\nto me I hadn't seen it before\nand I thought it was interesting that\nwe are going to advocate for that in\nthis house some of the appointments are\ngoing to be made by the senate committee\non assignments\nso Governor got it\nBig Man on Campus lieutenant governor\nspeaker those kind of balance out each\nother with the chambers\nbut then the Senate\ncommittee on assignments get some extra\nappointments so I'm I disagree that we\nshould step in and try to over cdas but\nI really don't understand why this house\nwould tip the members of this Commission\nin favor of those across the hall and I\nalso don't understand why we decided to\nchange it from the Georgia Supreme Court\nmaking the appointments\nthat's a significant change\nthe jqc which a lot of folks have\nmentioned\ntrying to draw parallels with this build\nthe judicial qualifications Commission\nhas appointments by Governor lieutenant\ngovernor speaker but also some by the\nGeorgia Supreme Court this commission\nwill have none by the Georgia Supreme\nCourt I think that's interesting while\nwe're on the subject of judicial\nqualifications committee for those that\nhave said why can't we just have a\ncommission for the prosecuting attorneys\nwhen we have them for the judges in\naddition to all these things that I'm\nhearing about folks say that are\noverlooking prosecutors\nwhy do we have a Judicial qualifications\ncommission why can't the State Bar just\nhandle the judge's misconduct too\nbecause not all judges are attorneys\nabout 40 percent of the judges that\nserve in this state are not attorneys\nwhich means the State Bar cannot oversee\nthem so we have to have a Judicial\nqualifications commission if you are a\nprosecuting attorney a D.A or solicitor\nyou have to be a lawyer which means you\nhave oversight from the State Bar in\naddition to all the other things and I\nknow that's repetitive but we don't seem\nto be getting it because people keep\ncoming up here still and saying this is\njust like the jqc no it's not\nthe other thing that's different in this\nbill from the version that we passed out\nis that\nuh the decisions of the hearing panel\nthe the hearing panel will make a\ndecision they'll be investigated\nthere'll be a hearing panel decision and\nthen there's the potential for an appeal\ninstead of that appeal going through the\nSupreme Court which is what our version\nin the house\num had in it now we're going to set up\nan appeals process that goes through\nCounty superior court systems\nbut they're different depending on who's\ndoing the appeal which I find curious\nif you are the D.A or the solicitor that\nis appealing a decision you go to the\nCounty Superior Court where you're\nelected\nbut if it's the claimant I suppose the\nperson that was complaining about you\nthat makes an appeal or I guess the\ncommission could appeal you go to the\nFulton County Superior Court no other\nplace\nthat seems interesting to me why you\nwould have different paths for that\nand then one of the other big changes\nand I've alluded to this a little bit\nalready but this version allows\ncomplaints to be filed as early as\nOctober of this year so I misspoke\nI misspoke first mistake I have ever\nmade from this well I'm sure\num I said October 1st 2024 was the first\ntime you could make a complaint under\nthis bill but it's actually October of\nthis year\num still the D.A that folks seem to be\nconcerned about in Athens is going to be\nup for election in May of 2024 so it's\nnot much longer but the version that we\npassed out of this house\nhad the first complaint not being able\nto be made until April of next year\nI those that drafted this version might\nalso want to think about\nthe smartness that's not really the\nright word the\nI'm confused as to how we can have a\nversion that says all the rules for the\ncommission must be established by\nOctober 1 and we're also going to start\ndealing with complaints on October 1.\nthat that seems to be a problem and\nprobably something that happens when you\nchange things and vote on it five times\nagain maybe there's a reason\nthat this hasn't passed out\nso I want to recap\nwhat we're setting up here this little\nbusiness will be repetitive and I\napologize but\nthis is a big deal y'all we're stepping\nall over elected officials\nfirst we are going to say that every\nprosecuting attorney must review every\nindividual case\nnow let's put aside\nhow are you going to know that how are\nwe possibly going to police whether a\nprosecuting attorney has looked at every\nindividual case\nputting that aside\nwe're saying in this bill that every\ndecision not to charge or to charge\ncan't be the basis for a complaint\nunless\nthere's bias or conflicts or quote\nfactors that are completely unrelated to\nthe duties of prosecution\nit's another drafting question what is\nthe difference between completely\nunrelated versus related\nthat's a question but what does that\nmean now the last time I was up here to\ntalk to you about this bill we talked\nabout the situation of little Johnny\nthat got in trouble\nhad a little too much to drink or was\nfound with a bag of something in his\nglove box that he shouldn't have and Mom\nand Dad called the prosecuting attorney\nand said\nuseful in discretion can we put them on\nprobation or can we put them in a\ndiversion program or can we just let\nthis one slide we talked about Uncle Bob\nwho got in trouble again we made the\ncall now I'm not suggesting that any of\nthose things are right believe me I\ncannot stand the back scratching that\nleads to some people getting treated\ndifferently under the law than others so\nI'm not here defending that system but\nwhat I'm telling you I know as well as\nyou do that that happens it happens\nevery single day in every Community\nacross this state now those decisions\nthat are made because so and so went to\nschool with somebody or yes that was a\nuseful indiscretion and we don't want to\nwe don't want to sideline this young\nlady or this young man's life for a\nyouthful indiscretion so we're gonna put\nthat in the drawer that's gonna happen\nand now every single time it happens\nwe're setting that person up to be\nremoved that prosecutor we're setting\nthem up to be removed from office that\ndoes not seem like a good use\nof money\nbut prosecutorial discretion goes\nfurther than that\nand again prosecutors prosecutorial\ndiscretion either have it or you don't\nyou have it or you don't that means\nevery single decision we heard this\nmorning from the well about how\nsolicitors are not\nProsecuting the crimes of\nthe things you're not allowed to do when\nyou're homeless tents and blankets and\nthings like that on the sidewalk they're\nnot Prosecuting that\nnow when they don't\nthey're going to be called up for\nremoval\nthat hardly seems like a good use of our\ntime and our funds\nand this commission and our elected DA's\nwhen we all know that there are bigger\nproblems and apparently we're doing all\nof this\nfor what I've heard is one person\nbecause you all know we're not allowed\nto pass a bill to actually just affect\none person so we have to do this bigger\nso we have to create all of these\ninvestigation panels for all these folks\nthat are probably doing what the\ncommunity wants we heard that from some\nspeakers in the well this morning have\nwe heard from the citizens I would bet a\nlot of money\nthat the citizens do not want their\nsolicitors\nProsecuting the homeless for their tents\nor their blankets or starting a fire or\nwhatever happens\nthey would rather them go after the\nrapes than the murders and the art and\nthe armed robberies\nso those DA's those prosecutors are\ndoing what the citizens want but now\nwe're going to call them in front of a\ncommission\nprobably made up of no one from their\ncommunity\nto ask them questions about it\nI don't think\nthat that is a very good use of our time\nso what do the citizens want\nwell since we've now voted on this four\ntimes it's about to be five times they\nvoted on it over there we've gone\nthrough\nI think this is the third year that\nwe've talked about this bill maybe at\nleast two\nand for the most part\nfolks have gotten themselves back into\nthis off back into this chamber the\ngovernor got reelected\nthe Attorney General got reelected I\ndon't think anyone's that worried that\nwe haven't created the prosecutorial\noversight commission and I think we\nwould be well to\nfinally put this thing to bed vote it\ndown and let's move on to things that\ncitizens actually want us to focus on\nand not one person thank you Mr Speaker\nI yield the well\nlady has yielded the well\nthat completes the Minority Report\nall right sorry we have another one that\nsigned up did you want to come back\nrepresentative Kendrick\nwill have the remaining three minutes\nand 20 seconds\nof The Minority Report thank you\nso I'm back and I wanted to point your\nattention to lines 212 through 218 of\nthe bill words matter we all know that\nwords matter you don't have to be a\nlawyer to know that words matter\nand it talks about how do you make a\ncomplaint and it talks about the\ncomplainant now the interesting thing\nabout this build is it has a definition\nsection but you will notice that it does\nnot define who the complainant is\nso I can file a complaint in Meriwether\nCounty somebody\nin Alabama can make a complaint against\na D.A in Gwinnett County I guess\ntechnically somebody outside of the\ncountry could make a complaint against a\nlocal D.A because complainant is not\ndefined in this statute this bill needs\na lot of work y'all it's going to have\nso many unattended consequences and if\nyou think the bill is only going to be\none million dollars think again because\nif you have an unlimited supply of\ncomplainants that can complain and file\ncomplaints this bill is going to balloon\nso if you care about fiscal\nresponsibility I urge you to vote no\nagainst this bill but for it it for the\nvery fact that this bill does not say\nthe words that it needs to say in order\nto narrow it down to make it fiscally\nresponsible and to make sure that we're\nnot spending unneeded funds on people\nwho can just make things anywhere\nso how many more minutes do I have Mr\nSpeaker\none minute and 45 seconds okay so I'm\ngonna read this line to this\nis all of my 20 minutes for my Minority\nReport so line two\ntwo starts and says in any complaint\nfile with the commission alleging a\nviolation of subsection 8 H and\nrequesting an investigation of an\nelected or or appointed district\nattorney or solicitor general the\ncomplainant shall be required to file\nwith the commission of sworn affidavit\ndetailing the personal knowledge of the\nfacts which personal knowledge is not\ndefined as well supporting the complaint\nincluding any interest the complainant\nmay have in the outcome of the case the\ncomplainant May attach documents to\nsupport the complaint and nothing is\ncold session shall be construed to limit\nthe ability of the commission to bring a\ncomplaint pursuant to this cold session\non its own motions\nladies and gentlemen\nas my colleague said before I got up\nhere we have so many other priorities\nwithin this state\ntrying to tell other elected officials\nhow to do their job should not be one of\nthem\nso I look forward to filing some\nlegislative oversight commission since\nwe want people to be able to remove\nother elected duly elected people from\noffice I look forward to seeing many of\nyou\num follow the conscious of your\nsolicitor general your attorney general\nand the people that elected you knowing\nthat they have the good sense to elect\nwho they want to elect in office and to\nmake sure that we are focusing on the\nthings that the state of Georgia wants\nus to focus on and I have what 30 more\nseconds Mr Speaker your time has expired\nokay thank you Mr Speaker\nthe ladies time expired and she yielded\nthe well good call\nnow we're here from the chairman of the\ncommittee from which this legislation\npassed through\nchairman title Tyler Paul Smith\nrecognized for your comments\nthank you thank you Mr Speaker Mr\nSpeaker I yield the balance of the\nChairman's time to Vice chairman Matt\nReeves\nrepresentative Reeves is recognized to\nspeak to the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker and chairman Smith\nI'm proud to speak in favor of house\nbill or Senate Bill 92 the prosecuting\nattorney's oversight Council I'd like to\napplaud representative Joseph gullet and\nvice chairman Houston Gaines for giving\nthis bill a thorough presentation and\nhearing uh both in the house and the\nSenate this bill has been perfected it's\nready to be enacted as a lawyer and as\nsomebody who sat through a lot of those\nhearings in the house Judiciary\nnon-civil Committee I wanted to speak to\na few points that may not have been\nbrought out yet in favor of this bill\none there was one argument that the\nState Bar of Georgia ought to handle\ndistrict attorney and and solicitor\noversight well the State Bar of Georgia\nregulates all 50 or 60 000 lawyers in\nGeorgia there are only 50 District\nAttorneys uh they're perhaps a smaller\nnumber of full-time solicitors and the\nState Bar is not equipped they don't\nhave a department or an investigative\nset up to investigate prosecutorial\noversight they are handling Bar\ncomplaints on a generalized basis and\nthey just uh did not sign up to\ninvestigate and hold accountable\nprosecutors so there's not really a\nviable option you've got to have a very\nflagrant situation for the State Bar to\nhave any effect secondly in the\ncommittee someone found that we still\nhave a law on the books on impeachment\nof District Attorneys and prosecutors\nand I I don't want to ask for a show of\nhands but I would imagine not too many\npeople want to have a a special session\nor take up precious legislative days and\nhold impeachment of prosecutors here in\nthis body that did happen that happened\nin the 1960s I believe was the the last\ntime there is a very close and\nappropriate analogy and this bill tracks\nthat and that's the judicial qual\nqualifications commission there is a\nGeorgia independent agency which is\nfunded by the state and it is uh well\nequipped and specialized to investigate\njudges who've engaged in wrongdoing\nsufficient to have them removed from\noffice the jqc has has done a great job\nof making sure we have a Judiciary\nthat's impartial and has integrity and\nthat is the analogy in a lot of ways for\nthis bill Senate Bill 92 having\nintegrity and prosecution is important\nGeorgia has a history of that in the\nYears following Watergate it was\nGeorgians who went and cleaned up the\ndepartment of justice under judge\nGriffin Bell as attorney general when\nthere was a single digit uh confidence\nin the federal department of justice and\nGeorgians cleaned that up with the kind\nof Integrity that we appreciate we don't\nwant to have a weaponized prosecution we\ndon't have a want to have a partisan\nprosecution we want to have a\nprofessional and independent prosecution\nthat's effective in enforcing our laws\nGeorgia Georgia has a neighbor to the\nSouth Florida the third largest state in\nthe nation and the way they handled a\nsituation down there recently shows one\nalternative that I believe this bill is\nbetter than in Florida the governor is\nempowered to remove a prosecutor who\nchooses on a blanket basis to decline to\nprosecute certain laws that the Florida\nGeneral Assembly he passes and that's\nwhat the governor down there did and the\ncourt affirmed that removal of a\nprosecutor who on a blanket basis\nignored the laws of the Florida house\nand the Florida Senate that's the stakes\nhere no one likes judicial activism but\non the other hand we don't want to have\nprosecutorial activism and prosecutorial\nveto of the laws that the people send us\nhere to make here in the House and\nSenate signed by the governor so\nwhile a case-by-case basis of\nprosecutorial discretion is appropriate\nif Little Johnny has a bag of weed or is\ndrunk driving and they're mitigating\ncircumstances that's one thing but for a\nprosecutor to say I have too much crime\nI'm going to quit Prosecuting all theft\ncases that's how we have a uh epidemic\nof car break-ins and theft and God\nforbid uh personal\num uh victimization of people so\num this is a good bill it's been\nthoroughly vetted\nelections every four years the toll that\nthat takes on Georgia is a massive\ncaseload I've got colleagues here in the\nhouse for Macon leader Beverly\nrepresentative Paris representative\nWashburn I remember when I was in\ncollege at Mercer district attorney\nWeston retired now judge Sims became\ndistrict attorney and uh former district\nattorney Weston drove to Americas to\nclean out a massive backlog that had\naccumulated over time that took a long\nlong time and a lot of money from that\ncounty that small County to clear out a\ncaseload that accumulated in the\nmeantime there was uh crime uh\nproliferation that was a result of that\nwe've heard in committee from Columbus\nWest Georgia Glenn County\nthe former district attorney from Banks\nCounty having serious problems that it\ntakes too long to remove a D.A under\ncurrent law so what this law does is it\nmakes sure that if a D.A is not\noperating their office in the interests\nof justice that we have an independent\nprofessional body who could remove them\nfor the benefit of the people and the\nsafety of our neighborhoods thank you\nfor supporting Senate bill 92.\nI yield well\ngentleman has yielded the well\nis there an objection to withdrawing The\ncommittee's Substitute chair here is\ndone the community substitute

model\naquatic safety plan based on National\nstandards for private swim instructors\nas Bill Evan refer to the Committee on\nPublic Health that committee recommends\nthat this bill do pass by rules\ncommittee substitute\nthank you Mr Clerk\nchair recognizes representative Hilton\nto present the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker colleagues I Rise\nto present to you Senate Bill 107 which\naims to protect Georgians who are\nreceiving private swim instruction uh by\nrequiring an aquatic safety plan uh the\nbackground of the bill stems from an\nincident in June 2023 when a\nfour-year-old boy Israel Scott uh\nnickname Izzy tragically drowned while\ntaking private swim lessons in Burke\nCounty I know I've got some speakers\nafter me but I want to recognize the\nfamily who has joined us in the gallery\nthere if they would stand up uh so we\ncan recognize them\n[Applause]\nIzzy's family has worked incredibly hard\nsince that time to to advocate for this\nlegislation which essentially says if\nyou're delivering private swim\ninstruction here in the state you've got\nto be able to provide a model plan which\nrecommends a recommended ratio of\nstudents to swim instructors a\nrecommendation for secondary supervision\nprovides for participation by a parent\nand requires certification uh for CPR by\nthe instructor themselves Izzy's law\nhere in Georgia will heighten awareness\nof safety needs create a reasonable\nmodel with an aquatic safety plan and\nprotects Georgians who choose to\npursue private swim instruction and so\nwith that I will yield for questions Mr\nSpeaker\nyou have no questions that I yield the\nwell and ask for favorable consideration\nthank you\nrepresent representative gladney\nis recognized to speak to the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker\ngood afternoon colleagues\nI Rise before you this afternoon\nto speak in support of SB 107\nas I speak to you this afternoon\nI will share with you a story\na story about a family\nrepresented in the Augusta delegation\nso what started as a beautiful warm\nsummer Day\nmid-june last year\nwhile all of us who are seated here\ntoday\nwere most likely doing very diligent\nwork advocating for our communities\nsupporting our families and being good\nneighbors\nmaking sure we were putting our best\nefforts into representing the folks that\nsent us here to occupy these seats today\nthere was a mom in Burke County\ngetting her busy day started as well\nMiss Dory Scott\nWas preparing to take her son her\nfour-year-old son Israel\nwhose nickname is Izzy\nfor his second swim lesson\nprior to the start of the lessons based\nupon her resources and her means as a\nlocal hair stylist\nmom did her due diligence\nshe checked around the area for\nreputable reputable instructors to make\nsure her baby boy was prepared for the\nsummer\nso that he could play and swim safely\nwith the others\nIzzy's older siblings had even learned\nto swim with the same instructor\nso Mom felt he would be an entrusted\ncare\nmeanwhile doing their ride in the car\nto the group swim lesson in the\nneighborhood close to their home\non this fateful day Izzy who was\nnormally a vibrant exuberant child who\nabsolutely loves superhero Black Panther\nand dinosaurs and playing with his older\nbrothers and sisters\nhe has a moment of pause\nand he is slightly hesitant about going\nto the lesson that day\nand says to his mother\nwhat if I drown\nand she does exactly what we do as\nmothers do\nshe Comforts him\nand she assures him\nthat it will be okay\nbecause she knows that she will be\nwaiting for him in the car\nwhen the lesson is over\nand she waits\nand she waits\nbut unfortunately\nthe rest of the circumstances\nsurrounding the events of that day are\nvery unclear\nand held the worst news of their lives\nfor Dory Scott and her family\nthere are a Litany of news articles and\nstories that offer many varying views of\nthe chaos that unfolded\nand out of complete respect for the\nfamily I will not revisit those details\nbut what I will say is this the reason\nwhy I stand before you today is because\nIzzy is no longer with us\nyou see ladies and gentlemen this is his\nobituary\nhe wasn't able\nthe latest release\nof his favorite\nsuperhero series\nhe didn't get a chance to spend his\nfifth birthday\nsurrounded by his family and his friends\nwho loved him\nas a matter of fact he didn't make it\nout of the lesson that day to his\nmother's car\nhe drowned\nthat day\nand the Dreadful reality\nis that is not an uncommon circumstance\naccording to the CDC in this country\nthere are over 4 000 fatal unintentional\ndrownings involving children every year\naveraging 11 drownings a day\nour entire Community was heartbroken for\nthis family\nand the tragedy that broke our entire\ncommunity\neverybody knew somebody that was\nconnected to this family in some way\nhow could something like this happen at\na swim lesson\nthe family wanted answers\nthe community wanted answers\nimagine Dory Scott's desperate pursuit\nto find answers for her son Izzy\nturning into a law because what she\nultimately discovers is there is no real\nstandardized measures for accredited\nswim instructors which brings us to our\ndiscussion today and an opportunity\ntoday to protect Children and Families\nthrough some measures in Izzy's law\nIzzy's law makes Provisions through a\nnumber of components which include\nrequirements for the Department of\nPublic Health to develop widely\naccessible safety plans for aquatic\nactivities based on standards of\nnationally National Partnerships with\nrecognized authorities such as the\nAmerican cross\nYWCA in the National drowning provincial\nAlliance and others it enacts\nrequirements for a CPR certification by\nswim instructors or an assistant\nadditionally Izzy's law raises the\nstandard of responsibility for those who\nprovide private aquatic lessons and\nheightens awareness for the public\nso in closing I'd like to leave you with\ntwo thoughts about why I support this\nbill\nnumber one because it speaks to all the\nreasons why we lift our voice in\nadvocacy for those who cannot be here to\nrepresent themselves\nnumber two because it is a good bill\nit has Provisions that protects other\nfamilies like the Scots from this awful\nfate of ever having this experience\nagain\nmy continued prayers are with the Scott\nfamily as a mother of three adult sons I\nam profoundly sorry for your\nunimaginable loss\nI respect the sacrifice you have made

Pest Control\nBill also includes a a measure from\nrepresentative Roberts\nthat has the cities and counties that\nthe cities and counties ask for related\nto cleanup from House Bill 1405 from\nlast

Zeo to the well we have some\nspeakers on the bill uh Rick I recognize\nrepresentative nullowitz speak to the\nbill\nthank you Mr Speaker\nfriends\narise before you today\nnot to speak against two-thirds of the\ncomponents of this bill I really just\nhave a problem with one-third of the\nbill two of the parts\nI have the utmost respect for my\ncolleagues who worked relentlessly to\nperfect HB 374 indeed I voted for that\nmeasure when it was before us on the\nhouse floor earlier this session\nI fully support C Pace I agree this is\ngreat language\nI offer my full-throated support for my\ncolleagues language that would clean up\nlegislation that passed last year\nI am delighted that language from HB 92\nlegislation that I co-sponsored actually\nfound a home post crossover day\nI only regret that it is included in\nthis particular bill which along with\nthe four sections that I support\nincludes these two other Provisions that\nare with sincere apologies to Samuel\nTaylor Coleridge\nare an albatross hanging from the necks\nof these otherwise worthy bills\nI first rise to speak against the\noriginal language of SB 145\nit is no secret that I am no fan of\nlocal preemption bills but the ones that\nreally stick in my craw are the local\npreemption bills that are entirely\nunnecessary\nwhen I initially read SB 145\nthe phrase that is now in lines 115\nthrough 117 of the bill that we have\nbefore us today caught my attention\nit reads\nthe general assembly finds that prudent\nlegislation I'm sorry The Prudent\nregulation of gas-powered leaf blowers\nis crucial to the welfare of Georgia's\neconomy\nagain the general assembly finds that\nprudent regulation of gas-powered leaf\nblowers is crucial to the welfare of\nGeorgia's economy\nstrange thing to say about leaf blowers\nI thought when I first read this\nnot even the truck weight spill has\nlanguage like that and how we move\nFreight and Georgia is arguably probably\nmore crucial to the welfare of our\neconomy than gas-powered leaf blowers\nthat odd scrap of language though\nsparked something in me\nsparked a memory it took me on a walk\ndown memory lane and now I ask you all\nto join me\nwith apologies to Sophia Petrillo\npicture it this house floor 2015.\nout on the ropes a brilliant and\ngorgeous young city council member\nfervently Works to convince the esteemed\nmembers of this body that they should\nvote against another\neerily similar to this bill local\npreemption bill this bill SB 139\ndeclared in lines 13 through 15. the\ngeneral assembly finds that The Prudent\nregulation of auxiliary containers is\ncrucial to the welfare of Georgia's\neconomy\nright\nif you weren't here in 2015 you may not\nknow that auxiliary container is a fancy\nway of saying plastic bags\nsb-139 was the plastic bag band\nif you want to continue this stroll down\nmemory lane with me\nyou can pull SB 139 up and compare it to\nSB 145 and when you do you will see what\nI realized earlier this session which is\nthat SB 145 is a line by line copy\na line by line copy of the plastic bag\nband\nit is as if whoever wrote this bill\ntreated SB 139 from 2015 as if it were a\nlegislative Mad Lib do you all remember\nMad Libs\nit's as if it was a Mad Lib replacing\nthe phrase auxiliary containers with gas\npowered leaf blowers wherever the former\nphrase appeared\nnow the plastic bag band ultimately met\nits demise here on this floor\nand it died on this floor because the\nmajority of the lawmakers here recognize\nthat their personal feelings about\nplastic bags aside\nit was a genuinely banal thing over\nwhich local control should be eroded\nin fact one house representative noted\nin 2015 that he would not want his own\nCity to plus a ban on plastic bags\nhe wanted and if you were here you'll\nremember his pickles and ice cream to be\nsecure in their auxiliary plastic\ncontainer\nbut this member who voted against this\nbill continued and this is a quote but I\ndon't have the same issues as Tybee\nIsland I don't have the same issues as\nAthens in his City My City has its own\nunique set of issues if we pass this\nbill we are taking a tool out of the\ntoolbox for those local governments to\ndeal with their own problems\nwhat did Tybee Island and Athens have to\ndo with plastic bag bands you may ask I\nwill tell you those are two cities that\nactually did have conversations and\nproposed ordinances about banning\nplastic bags in their Community prior to\nthe introduction of that local\npreemption bill in Tybee Island it was\nin the name of fiscal responsibility as\nkeeping the city's beaches clean is\nactually an indisputably I would say\ncrucial to the welfare of their economy\nand the city was spending tens of\nthousands of taxpayer dollars every year\nto keep those beaches free of plastic\nbags\nother than Tybee the only other\nmunicipality in Georgia only other than\nTybee only one other municipality in\nGeorgia was considering a plastic bag\nban and to date only one city in Georgia\nhas tried to enact such a band and how\nthey're enforcing it\nit really remains to be seen\nand I repeat\nno City at all has tried to regulate\nleaf blowers no city or county in\nGeorgia has tried to do anything to\nregulate the use of gas powered leaf\nblowers the ones that are so crucial to\nour economy other than maybe addressing\nit through a noise ordinance saying what\ntime of day you can use them because\nnobody no I mean nobody even the leaf\nblower manufacturers want them used\noutside their kitchen window or their\nbedroom window at seven or six o'clock\nin the morning\nI believe the takeaway from SB 139 in\n2015 is that there is no reason no\nreason\nto deny cities and counties the ability\nto individually determine for themselves\nwhether or not they want to regulate\nplastic bags or gas powered leaf blowers\nor gas stoves a local preemption related\nto Gas Appliances I suppose with\napologies to Hank Hill this would also\ninclude propane and propane accessories\nthat's the other part of this version of\nSB 145 that I find concerning this bill\nwas originally HB 438 unlike\nseveral other provisions of this bill\n438 never made it to the floor for a\nvote SB 145 was with apologies to\nPrincess Leia it's only hope\nas with gas powered leaf blowers no city\nor county no city or county nowhere\nnowhere in Georgia has entertained the\nnotion of limiting or prohibiting any\ngas Appliance I personally love my gas\nstove\nsupporters of this measure remind us\nthat states like California and cities\nlike Seattle have passed or proposed\nsimilar preemptions admittedly those\nstates are a little bit greener than we\nare\nthey may even be a little more woo-woo\nthan we are\nhere in Georgia\nbut they also have something out west\nthat we don't and that something is\nearthquakes\nare you familiar with the Cascadia\nsubduction zone\nI know tell me your dad is a\npetrophysicist without telling me your\ndad is a Petro physicist am I right my\nseventh grade science fair project was\nactually about plate tectonics and I\nknow that the science faculty at Dory\nIntermediate School in Spring Texas is\ndelighted that I am speaking to this\nissue today\nthe Cascadia subduction zone is a 1 000\nkilometer fault line that stretches from\nVancouver Island in Canada down through\nWashington State and Oregon ending near\nMendocino California\nthe scientists who study these things\nare certain that this fault line is not\nonly capable of producing earthquakes\ngreater than 9.0 on the Richter Scale\nthey also agree that the next big one\nthat'll probably be you know potentially\n9.0 on the Richter scale is about 75\nyears or so overdue and there is indeed\na 37 percent chance that this big one\nthis big earthquake that is going to\ncause like a massive tsunami\nand a lot of Destruction and will be\nsecond only an estimation to the 2010\nHaiti earthquake it's coming it's\noverdue it's going to happen and the 37\nchance gonna happen in the next 50 years\nwhat does this have to do with gas\nstoves I'm getting there I promise one\nof my sisters beloved sisters I have you\nmight hear me mention my sisters often\nfrom this well because there are\nactually four of them so it may seem\nlike I just have one sister who does a\nlot of different things but I actually\nhave four\nSeattle doesn't actually have a ban on\ngas stoves her house was built in 1941\nwhen they renovated a few years ago they\nmade sure everything was electric they\nhave electric heat electric hot water\neverything is electric\neven though they could choose gas but\nthe reason they have electric is not\nbecause there's any local preemption\nit's because after that earthquake\nhappens\nshe and her husband feel like their time\nwould be better spent digging their kids\nout of the rubble than trying to find\nthe gas shut off valve so their house\ndoesn't explode after the earthquake\nI don't know if comparing cities like\nBerkeley California or elsewhere out\nwest to any city in Georgia is in any\nway apropos\nagain no city in Georgia is considering\nany kind of a ban no county is\nconsidering any kind of a ban or any\nkind of limitations on the use of gas\nstoves I don't think any city in Georgia\nto be quite honest looks to Berkeley\nCalifornia for model ordinances\nI mentioned earlier that I love my gas\nstove and do you know who else loves\ntheir gas stoves\nthe many incredible chefs and restaurant\nowners that operate their restaurants\nthroughout the state of Georgia\nI am confident that if any city in\nGeorgia were to entertain such an\nordinance\nthe many many James Beard nominated an\naward-winning chefs\nin Atlanta Decatur Savannah Athens and\nCobb County all of these amazing\nnationally renowned and recognized chefs\nand restaurateurs alongside restaurants\nthat range from National chains to Mom\nand Pops they would all have something\nto say to their city councils and county\ncommissions on this issue and I would\nencourage them to say that because again\nI love my gas stove\nso why even go there\nwhy do we continue to see such an urgent\ncommitment of time and energy to\nensuring that local governments in\nGeorgia continue to not do something\nthey already have shown no interest in\ndoing no city or county wants to\nregulate gas powered leaf blowers no\ncity or county is trying to take away\nyour gas stove\nit's just not a thing it is not\nnecessary for us to have these bills\nso I was thinking about this this\nmorning thinking about what I was going\nto say if this bill made it to the floor\ntoday\nand one of the things I realized is that\nthese preemptions for gas powered leaf\nblowers\nare a little bit like a snipe hunt\nyou know that old sitcom trip\nokay if you're a boomer or Gen X you\nprobably remember the episode of Cheers\nwere Sam norm and Cliff they took\nFrazier on a snipe hunt\nthat was a banger man it's a good\nepisode if you're a whippersnapper\nyou've probably watched Atlanta and in\nseason four of Atlanta\nErn and Van take Lottie on a snipe hunt\nit's an old sitcom trope\nseen it a thousand times a thousand ways\nthe thing about a snipe Hunt is that you\nsend someone on a quest to find\nsomething that they will never find\nand that's a little bit what like these\npreemptions are\nthey are special interest groups mad\nliving legislation in an attempt to send\nthe general assembly on a quest to keep\ncities and counties from outlawing\nsomething that no one is even trying to\noutlaw\nit is a waste of our time it is a snipe\nhunt it is a legislative snipe hunt\nin a few minutes we will have the\nopportunity to vote our conscience on\nthis Christmas tree Bill the size of\nwhich is worthy of that rotunda right\nBeyond those doors and when that time\ncomes I urge you to ask yourself\nif good policy should include these\ncontinued erosions of local control in\nGeorgia I yield the well\nthe lady has yielded the well\nrepresenting Rahman is recognized as\nspeak to the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker\ncolleagues good afternoon\num you're probably wondering why I'm\ntalking about leaf blowers today I'm\nwondering why we're talking about leaf\nblowers today\nI think this is like the 5 000th Bill\nwe've read about a local rule preemption\nand I don't really know why today seems\nto be local preemption day but here we\nare\nso for those of you that haven't read\nthis massive bill yet that's about\n36 pages long we have quite a few\nProvisions in this one\nand per usual I am here to talk about\nyour unintended consequences within this\nbill\nif anybody is surprised uh you must be\nnew here\num\nso unfortunately with this bill SB 145\nit is attempting to put our thumb on the\nscale within the free market and y'all\nhave heard me say this before\npicture for a second it's Sunday morning\nand by some miracle nobody in your house\nhas woken you up yet whether that's your\ndog your spouse kids if you got them\nsee it's almost this quiet right and\nyou're finally sleeping in for the first\ntime ever\nand you hear\num\nright outside of your window door house\nwhatever the case may be\nand it's a very very loud leaf blower\nwhether it's in your apartment here in\nAtlanta in your home\ndoesn't matter\nand you're just mad because that was the\none day you were going to be able to\nsleep in and now you can't\nand you go talk to your city council\nperson and they say yeah that was just\npart of our typical Landscaping that we\ndo for the area\nand you go\nwhy do you have to use the loudest\noption possible on a Sunday morning\nnow\nI don't know about you\nbut I've actually heard electric leaf\nblowers and they are much much quieter\nthere's actually a reason why\nif you go to a Home Depot now you'll see\na lot more electric leaf blowers than\nyou will gas leaf blowers\nyou wanna know how I know that because\nmy husband decided to become a\nlandscaper recently but that's beside\nthe point\num\nso\nI have to wonder\nwhy are we so obsessed with gas leaf\nblowers\nis there like a big Pro gas leaf blower\nmovement that I'm not aware of\nsomeone please let me know if there is\nbecause I have not heard of it until\ntoday\nso as I mentioned now I go to my city\ncouncil person and I say man I was\nalmost able to sleep in the other day\nand I couldn't because this annoying\nleaf blower was going off and I want you\nto ban leaf blowers particularly the\nvery loud gas ones\nand you know if we pass this bill with\nthe city council person is going to say\nyou're my State Rep I can't do anything\nabout it but you can\nand I don't know about you but I don't\nwant to get involved in Municipal\nrelated issues that's why I'm a State\nRep\nand not a city council person granted I\ndidn't want to run for office to begin\nwith but that's a different story\nand\nit has been a long day\nso again I ask you why are we so\nobsessed with gas leaf blowers and why\nis it in this bill\nand while we're at it why is everything\nelse in this bill in here why do we\ncontinue to preempt local control on\nevery little piece that relates to the\nwell-being of that community and what\nthat Community Knows Best\nand this isn't even something that'll\nmake the community better\nI mean look with all due respect if you\nwant to smell the exhaust of a gas leaf\nblower by all means more power to you I\ndon't so please don't make me smell the\ngas of a leaf blower it really is that\nsimple and I'm not trying to be like\ncomical actually I'm very intentional\ntrying to be comical here because\nI don't understand why this keeps\nhappening in this body\nif for example I live in a community and\nwe all prefer electric related utilities\nor in this case you know stoves or\nwhatever it is why can't we decide on\nelectric stoves believe it or not with\nsome pots and pans it actually works\nbetter\ndid you know that I just found that out\nrecently\nso in all seriousness\nthis bill is the amendment and\namalgamation of a lot of other bills\nwhat we're basically saying is that a\nlot of local governments and potentially\npublic universities\nare effectively prohibited from choosing\ntheir energy source\nand again I don't understand why\nif a university wants to save costs and\nthey find out electric is cheaper\nshouldn't they be able to do that\ndon't we want our public universities to\ncost us less money\ndidn't we just talk earlier about how we\ncan't afford that extra five percent for\nwhatever reason\nbut now we're saying oh we can afford\nmore money to prop up an industry that\nfrankly\nis becoming less relevant because we're\nfinding better technology\nand that's okay\nif an industry wants to compete in the\nmarket and I hear this all the time when\nwe say we want to protect consumers we\nwant to do this we should let the market\nfigure it out okay let the market figure\nit out on this one\nwhy are we insisting that we need to put\na thumb our thumb on that scale and in\nparticular a scale that frankly smells\nvery bad\nI don't like the smell of gas exhaust\nthere's also a lot of questions\num that have come up as a result of this\nbill at least in my mind\nif cities have energy benchmarking\nprograms is this bill going to now stall\nthose programs or even prohibit them\ncompletely\nwhat about if a city is trying to run\nsome electric lines or gas lines or\nwhatever the case may be and they find\noh there's actually something in the way\nmaybe gas doesn't make more as much\nsense maybe you should try electricity\nare we going to now prevent a city from\ndoing that and instead force them to run\na gas line like three times as long\nI know these seem like really silly\nquestions and things that you and I\ndon't have to deal with because we're\nnot the ones sitting in those planning\nmeetings but I promise you there will\nnow be people who have to pinch pennies\nand cut costs and potentially put more\npeople at risk because we decided you\nknow what this is how we want\nmunicipalities to function\nwe don't all live in the same kinds of\nhousing we don't all live in the same\nkinds of towns we don't all live in the\nsame kinds of cities each one has\nrelatively unique infrastructure\nparticularly related to when that town\nor city was established\nI know in one of my cities there's been\na lot of amazing Innovation on\nelectricity and electric related\nresources\nit I think this bill is going to hinder\nthat and frankly I think Georgia is\ngoing to be worse off\nbecause that city has done an incredible\njob of finding solutions for problems\nthat we have been talking about for a\nlong time\nwhether that's Transportation whether\nthat's utilities whether that's\naccessibility you name it\nfrankly I geek out every time I go visit\nthat City\nso now I have to explain to them why\nsome of their programs might now be\nhalted which by the way those programs\nbring in jobs\nso now we're risking potential jobs with\nthis bill\nI know I made a joke earlier but why are\nwe even doing this\nbecause at the end of the day\nas we continue to do this related to\nwhatever pet issue we come up with that\nday our cities are going to become more\nand more hindered to address the\nproblems that we then fault them for and\nthen we turn around and wonder why our\ncities are not doing more to help with\nwhatever issue we're dealing with\nhere's the other piece that's really\nimportant\nfor more than five years Georgia has\nbeen a leader in clean energy jobs but\nthis is a blatant attempt to stop that\nit's like we keep moving one step\nforward and three steps back\nthose things are exciting we've got kids\nright now in schools who are preparing\nfor those jobs\nand now you're telling me by the time\nthey graduate those jobs might not be\nthere anymore\nwhat's the point\nif every time something Innovative\nhappens something exciting happens we\nrecruit kids for that pipeline in our\npublic universities and then they\ngraduate and find out oh actually this\nbody passed a law that job isn't there\nanymore\nwhy do we do that\nit's gas y'all\nliterally this is what we're talking\nabout here it is gas\nI mean seriously\nit's okay for people to pick other\nsources of energy to heat up their homes\nto cook their food\nto power their cities\nthat is totally okay to do and when we\npreempt them from doing that\nfrankly the negative consequence is far\noutweigh whatever this bill is trying to\ndo now\nI think it's also important to\nunderstand that Georgia has no\nsignificant methane reserves to frac or\ndrill this means that as a result of\nthis bill we're going to end up losing\nmore money out of the state in order to\nbe able to give people the gas they're\ngoing to be asking for\nI don't know about you but I would much\nrather spend my money here in Georgia I\nreally like the state\num\nand to be honest with you the sad\nreality of the situation is that this\nbill is not unique to our state this\nkind of legislation has been spreading\nall around our country\nand it is making it incredibly difficult\nto move forward as Society\nbecause that's what this is about\nwe've found ways to heat our homes\nfor in much cleaner ways we've found\nways to cook our food in much safer ways\nwe found ways to\nDrive our cars\nwithout as many emissions as we as we\nused to have and I don't know about you\nbut I want to breathe easier\nthere's nothing I hate more than going\non a run\nand having to inhale all that exhaust\nfrom the cars around me\nand when I go to a park and all the leaf\nblowers and lawn mowers are going off\nand suddenly I have to smell that gas\ntoo\nso I can't get away from the smell of\nexhaust on the roads obviously can't get\naway from it on the parks because now my\nmunicipality can no longer mandate that\ntheir contractors have electric leaf\nblowers and electric lawn mowers which\nby the way were great\nwe have them I was going to bring one\ntoday to show you all but I didn't\nrealize this bill was coming so\nbut\nat the end of the day\nI really sincerely hope that no matter\nwhat you've heard about this bill that\nyou will reconsider\nbecause I promise you there's going to\ncome a day where one of your city\ncouncil members is going to come to you\nand say we got this awesome Grant or we\nhave this opportunity for a great\nproject and you're going to have to tell\nthem sorry I voted on this bill a couple\nyears ago and it's not going to let you\nactually do that because you're\npreempting because you know you're\ntrying to prevent gas leaf blowers or\nwhatever you're trying to do\nhow is that fair\nhere's the here's the other piece of it\nyou know like I said we have talked a\nlot about various preemption bills in\nthis body\nand I've kind of talked a little bit\nabout jobs a little bit about the\nuniqueness of each town or city\nbut I sincerely hope that as you vote\nfor this bill whatever talking points\nyou've heard about this bill please\nconsider your cities and towns instead\nbecause there are so many opportunities\nand grant opportunities out there right\nnow to make our cities and towns better\nand so I strongly urge you to vote no on\nthis bill I yield the well thank you Mr\nSpeaker\nthe lady has yielded dwell\nrepresenting Brad Thomas is recognized\nto speak to the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker so today arise to\nspeak out in support of this bill sb145\nand I want to talk a little bit about\nsome of the the energy that we've\ndiscussed during this session one of\nthem being electric vehicles\num I don't know if many of you remember\nbut I stood up here in the well in\nsupport of the electric vehicle bill and\nI did so for one reason because I\nbelieve in energy choice\nand that means electric that means\ngasoline that means whatever form of\nfuel hydrogen whatever form of fuel that\nyou want I'm okay with that and we\nshould be doing things that support that\nthis bill does that\nand\nwhen it comes to Lawn Service\nspecifically because that seems to be\none of the number one things I hear a\nlot about down here in the well today on\nthis bill\num\nwhat you hear about the the electric\nleaf blowers and the issue with electric\nleaf blowers they just don't have the\npower that a gasoline leaf blower has\nthat that technology has not gotten to\nwhere it needs to be to be competitive\nin a free market economy and that's what\nwe want\nthat's what this bill does it makes sure\nthat the free market is available for\nthose small business people that are\nblowing and taking care of our Lawns and\nand golf courses or whatever else that\nthat we choose it may be schools\nso that they they can go and buy\nequipment that they can afford and don't\nhave unnecessary burdens put on them to\nbuy equipment that quite frankly doesn't\nwork as well\nit requires a substantial amount of\ninfrastructure that they have to\npurchase to even be able to use that\ntype of equipment let's be honest the\nbattery doesn't is not going to last all\nday but you can fill up a gas tank\nfairly quickly\nso with that being said again I I\nimplore all of you here let's think\nabout the mom and pop let's think about\nthe the dad or in the the small business\nowner that is just trying to do the best\nthey can to survive and let's let the\nfree market rule thank you Mr Speaker\nyou're the wolf\nrepresentative Roberts is recognized to\nspeak to the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker colleagues I know\nmy position may not be popular this bill\nhas a lot of things in it it does but my\nunderstanding is every single one of\nthem passed out of a committee they've\njust kind of been all compiled in this\nincluded in that is um some cleanup\nlanguage that accg GMA\num several jurisdictions around the\nstate asked me to bring to my bill from\nlast session which was HB 140 1405.\nand it kind of swept up some\nadministrative permits that we did not\nmean to sweep up into the definition of\nquasi-judicial and it was going to\ncreate complications which the whole\npoint of the bill was to minimize\ncomplications and reduce complications\nso I'm grateful that this part has been\nincorporated into this bill\num\nI also believe in local control\nI try to look at each one individually\nand I'm going to give a different\nperspective on the leap blower\nI have a landscaper Rigo\nhe works with his brother his wife they\ndo everything legally they have a\nfive-year work visa they work harder\nthan any person I've ever seen\nand I've got to believe that this bill\nwas brought because there was some\nthreat to\ngas lease blowers and right now there's\nno product on the market that's\ncomparable that he could do his job and\nso I would love for the industry to I I\ndid vote for the sunset Amendment but it\ndidn't pass because I'd like to force\nthe industry to come up with something\nthat would be cleaner and would be\ncomparable but right now it doesn't\nexist and I just can't vote against this\nbecause of my guy Rigo thank you Mr\nSpeaker I yield the well\nlady has yielded well\nrepresentative Victor Anderson is\nrecognized to speak to the bill\nhe is our last speaker on the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker I'll be very brief\nI just want to point out one thing about\nboth the gas leaf blower provision and\nthe gas Appliance what we're all calling\nthose two items in this bill there's\nnothing in either of those bills that\nprevents a local governing Authority\nfrom implementing Energy Efficiency or\nenvironmental programs that are\nincentive based what it does is it\nprevents them from\npenalizing lack of participation in\nthose programs we're not saying that you\ncan't have programs we're not saying you\ncan't promote those types of energy\nchoices but we we are saying that you\ncan't mandate them and penalize the lack\nof participation thank you Mr Speaker\nthat completes the questions the\ngentleman yielded the well\nis there any objection to the previous\nquestion being ordered chair here's none\nthe previous question is ordered we do\nhave a Minority Report representative\nJasmine Clark is recognized to\nbring the Minority Report members\nneed your attention\nplease give the lady in your will your\nattention\nrepresentative Clarks recognized\nthank you Mr Speaker colleagues there\narise to ask you to vote no on SB 145\num\nI think we've already discussed kind of\nthe Ridiculousness of having to debate\nleaf blowers\num I want to point out that today\num in another state babies\nwere killed\nby bullets\nand we have not debated a single\nbill when it comes to protecting babies\nfrom being killed by bullets but today\nwe're talking about leaf blowers\nI think that's an important context\nso you know\nright right now I'm sure there are\nplenty of you who can relate to the\nstory that was told in the well about\nthe early morning leaf blowers and the\ntruth is they are loud\nthey are very very loud and especially\nwhen you're tired and you are hoping to\nget a little extra bit of sleep let's\nsay the day after signing die you're\ntired because we've been here all day\nand then your neighbor decides hey you\nknow I feel like uh blowing some leaves\nat 7am\nright now\nyour cities and your local governments\ncould restrict hours when you could have\nsuch loud noises\nbut arguably this bill could preclude\nthat\nthat's an issue\nbecause no one likes to find out that\nthe reason why their city can't do\nsomething about a nuisance is because\nthe state is is stopping them or\nprohibiting them from being able to do\nthat\nalso I just want to point out how this\nbill is truly an attack on clean energy\ninitiatives\nand it's very curious to me\nbecause\nwe see where the industry is moving and\nit seems like someone outside in the\nhall\nhas decided we've got to protect gas at\nall costs\nthere's no reason to do this because\nright now we already because of a bill\nthat we passed before prohibit our\ngovernments from adopting policies\num that\num prohibited Things based on their\nsource of fuel\nbut now we're going to go further and\nsay not only can you not prohibit it you\ncan't even restrict it so what does that\nmean what's the difference between\nprohibiting and restricting\nnow we're saying you know what you can't\nnot only can you not say you can't have\nthis Appliance now we don't even want\nyou incentivizing using one thing over\nanother which could be considered a\nrestriction\nwe do not want you saying that we are\ngoing to build more affordable houses\nthat are all or Total Electric\nor that utilize solar power because we\ndon't want to make the gas industry mad\nso let's zoom out for a bit and let's\ntalk about affordable housing because\nI've talked to a number of people in\nhere on both sides of the aisle and they\nsay they truly do care about addressing\nour affordable housing crisis\nI've actually seen a couple of other\npreemption bills they didn't get a vote\nbut they definitely got some signatures\nfrom people right here in this chamber\nfrom frankly both sides of the aisle\nthat would have told governments that\nwhat color they cannot restrict based on\ncolor they cannot restrict based on you\nknow building materials all these\ndifferent things because they said they\nclaim they care about affordable housing\nbut now we have a bill that says that\nyou cannot favor\nbuilding materials or appliances\nthat are going to be more affordable and\nallow for a building of more affordable\nhouses it is actually cheaper it is less\nexpensive to build with Total Electric\nthe data bears that out\nnot just that as we said as I said we\nare moving toward using things like\nsolar and that's amazing you know why\nbecause here in in Georgia we've got\nsolar plants coming up we got battery\nplants we are actually in Georgia moving\nin the direction of innovation\nEconomic Development and Innovation is\nhappening right here in our state\nwe are trying to lead the way in these\nthings and then you slap a bill like\nthis on our desk and say absolutely not\nyou must uh at least uh or you cannot\nsay that you can't use gas or you can't\neven restrict it it's not even just\nabout a prohibiting it's about\nrestricting as well\nso\nwhat if these cities want to incentivize\nEnergy Efficiency would they be breaking\nthe law\nwhat if cities want to incentivize\nBuilders coming in and building more\naffordable housing by using Total\nElectric are they breaking the law is\nthat what we want to do here\nand at the end of the day\nI know there are several people\non the opposite side of the aisle then I\nthat talk a lot about small government\nwhen they're talking to their\nconstituents\nsmall government this small government\nthat there is nothing small government\nabout this bill in fact there's nothing\nsmall about this bill we've added all\ntypes of crap to this bill since it was\nfirst drafted this bill got bigger and\nbigger and bigger and with it government\ngot bigger and bigger and bigger and\nwe're going to vote for that\nit's interesting to me because most of\nthe people outside of here would claim\nthat it's the Democrats\nthat are all about big government it's\nthe Democrats that want to control your\nlives it's the Democrats that want to\npreempt local control\nit's not us\nthis bill bears that out\nit is not us that is that is\nintroducing these re preemptive bills it\nis not us\nso ask yourself\nand I'll make sure\nthat you know uh speeches like this get\nposted so people know exactly who is for\nsmall government and who is not for\nsmall government\nbecause I think we think what we do in\nhere stays in here and that's not the\nway it's supposed to work we're doing\nthe work of the people and so the people\ndeserve to know who's voting in their\nbest interest and who is not and so I am\ngoing to yield the well by asking you\nall to vote no on this government\noverreach for once we've already had\nplenty of preemptive bills maybe this\none we can finally say this is the final\nstraw this is the straw that broke the\ncamel's back\nvote no on this bill vote Yes on local\ncontrol and let our local governments do\nwhat the people elected them to do thank\nyou Mr Speaker I yo the well\nthe lady has yielded the well\nnow we'll have the Chairman's time up to\n20 minutes\nthere's a lot of the Chairman's time\nI'll recognize\nchairman lahood to speak to the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker\nI do not believe I'll need 20 minutes\nfor this\nI just wanted to clear the air on a\ncouple things and then let everybody\nvote\nso this bill does have a lot of parts to\nit there are several bills that got\nadded to the original uh gas leaf blower\nbill\nand let me just clarify on the leaf\nblowers\nthe bill does not\nuh\ndo anything to protect gas leaf blowers\nthat it doesn't do for electric leaf\nblowers all it does is required that\nlocal government\nany any ordinance or law that they\ncreate for one type of blower goes for\nthe other type\nyou know you could uh\nyou can get a goat to climb a tree but\nyou're better off to hire a squirrel in\nother words\nyour landscape provider\nif he can do a better job with a gas\nleaf blower than he can with an electric\nlet him do his job\nand if you want to hire a landscape crew\nthat uses all electric then do that it's\nup to you nobody's telling you that you\ncan't use the the leaf blower of your\nchoice\nthe bill just says that the the local\ngovernment cannot treat one type of\nblower different than the other\nthe other parts of this bill have all\nbeen thoroughly vetted through committee\nseveral of the parts have passed through\nthis house already\nand um\nwe've got biparton support bipartisan\nsupport\nfor every\npart of this bill now I know there's\nthere's concerns on both sides for some\nparts but there's bipartisan\nbipartisan support at some level for\nevery part of the bill so as for your\nfavorable consideration and uh Mr\nSpeaker if there's any questions I'll\ntake one or two\ngentleman has a question or two\nto your left representative Oliver has a\nquestion way to your left right Mr\nSpeaker I Rise to make a motion\nright now we're in the posture of a\nquestion I'll be glad to entertain your\nMotion in a moment thank you sir\nmy year ought to represent Bentley on\nthe left and the back has a question\nladies recognized\nthank you Mr Speaker there's a gentleman\nyield sure friendly question and I'm\njust really trying to understand this\ndebate because what I first learned of\nthis uh this bill last year\nit was on I was on an impression that\nthis legislation and I'm going to use\nfor an example\nis it not true that I was on an\nimpression that this bill what helps Mr\nErnest that works with me at the funeral\nhome Mr Ernest is a small business owner\nand he cut grass in Taylor County and\nalso cut grass in Peach County and the\nmajority of his customers are\nelderly women that's living on a fixed\nincome and so he's a very small business\nowner\nand so is it not true that I was just I\nwas on an expression that this bill will\nmake it where Taylor County couldn't put\nan ordinance in place that mandated Mr\nErnest to have only one type of blower\nand Peach County would have something\ntotally different which would make it a\nlittle difficult for Mr Ernest to be\nable to really operate his very small\nbusiness in the manner he needed to\ntrying to serve older individuals on a\nfixed income\nso I believe what you're saying is this\nbill would provide stability and\nconsistency to people who provide the\nservice of landscaping and that would\nmight require the use of a leaf blower\nso you are correct you know what you\nspeak okay that helps me thank you sure\ngentlemen yield for another question uh\none more Mr Speaker\nrepresentative let's see chairman Alan\nPowell to your right in the rear is\nrecognized for a question\nthank you Mr Speaker will the gentleman\nyield yes sir\nas I look through this bill and I was on\ngovernmental Affairs but is it not true\nthat each of the sections of this bill\nhave already cleared the house Committee\nin various forms you are correct is it\nalso not true\nthat when we talk about in a lot of the\ndiscussion here has been about\npreemption but is it not true that the\nlocal government's Representatives with\nACC gym and GMA either they were far or\nneutral on all of these positions you\nare correct again\nif I might further yield if you may\nfurther yield\nso then looking at all of these sections\nand I continue to hear a lot of the\ndiscussion I know that a lot of the\nmembers are tired and a lot of things\nhave been said is it not true that this\nis a customary way of passing\nlegislation because every member of this\nhouse that puts in a bill is going to\ntry to the very end to be dedicated to\ntry to pass his or her bill\nthat is correct uh this our governmental\nAffairs committee that you are a member\nof\num I believe is one of the busier\ncommittees in this house and Heard lots\nof bills this year and some we just uh\nsome just ran out of time\nso yes\nif the gentleman will further yield yes\nsir then is it not true that this is a\ncustomary way we just didn't invent it\nwith uh house Senate Bill 145 but these\nbills that are commonly referred to as\nChristmas trees or a variety of\ndifferent names that have a lot of\ndifferent subject matters this is a\ncustomary way of trying to get things\nacross to the other house to try to get\nit either to a conference committee or\nto get it to pass so that each member's\nlegislation they worked on will have a\nchance to pass and for the benefit of\nthe for the state\nyou've served in this house a long time\nand you know what you speak one further\nquestion if you'll yield all right one\nmore one of the questions that I've\nheard back here was something about\nplastic bags is it true there's nothing\nin this bill about prohibiting plastic\nbags that is absolutely true thank you\ngentlemen thank you Mr Speaker I'll\nyield the will gentleman has yielded the\nwell\nfor for what purpose does representative\nOliver rise Mr Speaker I Rise to make a\nmotion stage of motion\nI move that pursuant to article 3\nsection 5 paragraph three of the state\nconstitution of Georgia that Senate Bill\n145 Provisions be declared not germane\nwith one another in support of this\nmotion Mr Speaker I will suggest that\nthe Appellate Court of Georgia wall\nversus Board of Education say that the\nprovisions of any bill must have a quote\nUnity of purpose and secondly under\nloot's V Forum that the provisions must\nbe logical have a logical and natural\nconnection Mr Speaker in making your\nruling please tell me how leaf blowers\nsee space annexation have a Unity of\npurpose\nwould the representative I understand\nthe very learned attorney and research\nconstitutionally would you state that a\nlittle more clearly for me\nloots this is versus Forum says that\nprovisions of A bill must have a logical\nand natural connection and wall versus\nBoard of Elections state that the\nprovisions of Bill must have a Unity of\npurpose\nin quoting the constitution of Georgia\nit is clear that under article 3 section\n5 paragraph three of the Constitution\nProvisions must be declared to be the\ngermane with one another\nso I'm I think I can rule on the\ngermanus I'm not sure about the\nconstitutionality you have to take that\nup across the street over there with\nsome of those folks but here's what I'll\ntell you\ntwo parts of this we've debated it\nthoroughly\nthese issues in included in this bill\nwere debated in committee\nby the committee members\nand they've they've done their jobs\nthey were it was voted out of the\ncommittee\nand I want every member of this house to\nhave opportunity\nto render their decision\nso I respect the gentlelady but I'm\ngoing to rule that this this issue is\nJermaine all of these issues are\nJermaine and this house will take a vote\non on this Senate bill 145.\nyes ma'am you may have one follow-up is\nrecognized what does leaf blower and sea\nspace have as a Unity of purpose\nI appreciate your question I think your\nquestion has been asked and answered\nthis bill is Jermaine the issues of this\nGermain and we're going to take a vote\non it\nis there any objection to the committee\nsubstitute the chair hears none the\ncommittee substitute is adopted is there\nany objection to agreeing to the report\nof the committee
