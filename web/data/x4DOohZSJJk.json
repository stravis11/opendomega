Secretary, please finish the caption.\nSenate bill 268 by some robbers in the 29th and others, the bill to be entitled to amend Article 2, Chapter 11, Title 16 of the OCGA, really, to offenses against public order, and for other purposes, Mr. President, Senate, Quenia, Judiciary, recommends that this bill do pass, or so please submit it, Senator Strickland, Chairman, that police will be our Mr. President.\nRight now, Senator from the twenty-night, speak to the bill.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nFellow Senators, Senate Bill 268 is a very simple piece of legislation.\nIn many states it's called the Halo Act.\nThe purpose of this is to place a 25-foot safety zone around any first responder conducting\ntheir job, doing their job, if you will.\nAnd first responders, as we know, are EMTs, firefighters, and law enforcement officers.\nWhat it does is it set up a 25 foot radius circle around the situation while the individual\ndoes their job and carries out their duty.\nShould any individual intentionally try to interfere with the first responder while they're\ndoing their job, they will be arrested, can be arrested.\na simple piece of legislation, I'll stand for any questions, or if not, I'll yield the\nwell, Mr. President.\nYou do have one question, recognize the Senate from the 47th.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nWith the center of yield.\nYes, I will yield to my friend from Athens.\nFor clarification, going down the highway, you know, you're supposed to slide over a lane\nif you can, lanes are typically 12 feet wide, officers over there.\nthan 25 feet away from you.\nThat is an exemption in this Halo Act, is it not?\nYes, sir.\nThe Halo Act is not necessarily involved individuals driving in motor vehicles.\nWhat you're describing is the move-over law.\nAnd so as long as the individuals properly operate in their vehicle and they move over\nin order to avoid hitting the officer, hitting somebody that he may be helping, would be\nthe move-over law.\nThis does right here is if the officer is out engaged in something, if the EMT is out engaged in something,\nif the firefighter is out engaged in something, and they ask an individual to step back 25 feet,\nthat individual would step back.\nThey can still continue to have a conversation, they can continue to film.\nJust as long as they don't interfere with the responsibilities and duties of that first responder at the time,\nas long as they don't do that, they will not be in violation of this law.\nWhat I want to make sure if you further clarifies that we're not creating a two lane move over in this case.\nI was for me with the move over law.\nI just want to make sure that we can still do that safely and pass and not, you know,\nbecause you'd be within 25 feet a lot of times.\nAbsolutely. No, sir.\nThis, this is just for individuals outside the vehicles.\nIt has nothing to do with the move over law.\nThank you very much.\nThank you, sir.\nYeah, no, no further questions.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nI yield the well.\nDoes any other Senator Wish speak for against the measure?\nChair, here's none.\nIs there objections to the previous question being ordered?\nChair, here's none.\nPrevious questions are ordered.\nIs there objections to agreeing to the Board of Committee,\nwhich is favor to the passes of the bill?\nChair, here's none.\nBefore the committee is agreed to,\nis there objections to the main question being ordered?\nChair, here's none.\nThe main question is ordered.\nQuestions on the passes of the bill?\nAll those in favor of vote?\nYay, all opposed, nay.\nSecretary, I'm not in the machine.\nYou\nI don't know what you're going to do, but I don't know what you're going to do, but I don't\nknow what you're going to do.\nOn the passage of the bill, the yeas are 37, the nays are 17, and this bill has received the requisite constitutional majority in their forest pass.\nWe're going to have Senator from the 48th.\nGood evening, Mr. President.\nAsking Amos's consent to please lift Senate Bill 212 from the table.\nSecretary, read the cap.\nSenate Bill 212, by Senator Still, the 48th, and others built between Title IX to amend\nPart 14, Article 6, Chapter 2, Title 20 of the OCGA,\naccording to other educational programs under the Equality Basic Education Act,\nso it's the prohibitive disclosure of public student directory information to political candidates,\ncampaign committee, political action committee, political organizations,\nor persons, or groups acting on their behalf, to amend Article 15, Chapter 2, Title 21,\nof the OCGA, and for other purposes that can be seen or are mispresident.\nIs there objection, the objection, Secretary finish the caption.\nSenate Bill 212 by 100 still to 48th and others.\nBill 209 to amend part 14 in Article 6, Chapter 2, Title 20 of the OCGA, related to other educational programs under the Equality Basic Education Act.\nSo it's the period that the disclosure of public student directoring information to political candidates, campaign committees, political action committees, political organizations, and for other purposes.\nMr. President, the Senate Committee on Ethics recommends that this bill to pass respectfully submitted Senator Watson-Chairman,\nThank you, Mr. President, colleagues, Senate Bill 212.\nThis is an election bill.\nIt ensures that campaigns and candidates know that it is improper, it is wrong to go under\nfalse pretense to harvest children's data, particularly minors.\nI have worked in good faith with my friends across the aisle on this and while this bill\nwas engrossed earlier today.
