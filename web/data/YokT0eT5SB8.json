  "transcript": "All members, all members, please come to the floor. Good Wednesday morning. Good to see you all this morning because the hour, convening having arrived, all members will please come to the floor. All members come to the floor and take your seats. Mr. Clerk, will you ring the bell? The bell is ringing. The bell is ringing. The bell is ringing. The bell is ringing. Good morning again. We're going to have the morning roll call.

All members voted. Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machines? Doer keepers, will you please close the doors and keep them closed? As is our custom, we will begin our day with Scripture reading prayer by our chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 48th House District, Representative Scott Hilton, Chairman Hilton. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Your committee on information, sorry, I've got the wrong, that's the wrong thing. Hold on. Good morning, colleagues. God is good. Amen. The Hebrew word for peace is Shalom, and with two days remaining in the legislative session, there is no better person to bring us some Shalom than Rabbi Hershey Minkowitz. I'll say he shared with me in his house they have 11 children. So I'm guessing he has very little Shalom in his house, but he's going to bring some to this house today. In the summer of 1998, Rabbi Hershey Minkowitz was sent to Alfreda by the Chabad movement. Ladies from the 51st, I'm getting a thumbs up. Thank you. A subsection of the Orthodox Jews to establish a Jewish worship and educational center for growing Jewish community in North Fulton. Rabbi Hershey, as he's affectionately known, leads the Chabad of North Fulton until this day. Their center has become a primary address where Jews of all walks of life and religious backgrounds gather, for Jewish enrichment and inspiration. Colleagues, please join me in welcoming Rabbi Hershey. Thank you. Good morning. A friend of mine recently told me that he took one of those private space tours to go see the moon. And when he came back, he told me, would you believe it? They even have a restaurant out there. I asked him, how was the food? He said the food was delicious, but the atmosphere was terrible. I hope you won't mind if I'm going to give you a brief two-minute spiel about the moon. I'm not an astronomer. There was not in the bio that Representative Hilton just read. It's just that next weekend we're going to be celebrating Passover. On April 12th, the Jewish community is going to be celebrating Passover. Interestingly, last year in 2024, Passover began on April 24th, 12 days later than this year. And in 2023, Passover began on April 5th. So why does that so? Why does it fluctuate? In fact, let me just quickly tell you the last five years since 2020 and see if you can detect the pattern. 2020, Passover started on April 8th, March 27th, 22 April 15th, 23 April 5th, 24 April 24th, and this year, April 12th. Every year Passover gets 11 or 12 days earlier than the year before, and then every two or three years, it gets set back a month ahead. Why is that? Well, in the book of Exodus, chapter 12, just before the Jews were leaving Egypt, God told the Israelites that from that point forward, they would begin keeping their calendar based on the cycle of the moon. Every month when a new moon appears, it's a new moon appears, it's a new month. Passover is always going to be on the 15th day of the first month when the moon is the fullest. And then in Exodus, chapter 13, verse 4, as the Jews are leaving the shackles of bondage behind, God says to them, and I quote, today you are going out in the month of spring. Rather than focusing on the name of the month, God is focused on the season, the fact that we're going out in the spring. So much so that later in Deuteronomy, just before the Israelites are about to enter into the promised land, God gives them a very firm reminder about how important it is to keep the holiday of Passover in the month of spring. Deuteronomy 161, you shall keep the month of spring and make the Passover offering to the Lord your God, for in the month of spring, the Lord your God brought you out of Egypt. Sounds easy enough. However, to just one small problem, and that's why the holiday date varies every single year. You can see the lunar calendar, the calendar that goes according to the cycle of the moon has 354 days, 11 days less than a solar calendar of 365 days. So every year, Passover is going to get 11 days earlier and 11 days earlier. But hold on a second, God told the Jewish people that they have to keep the Passover in the spring. So it was that possible, if every year it gets 11 days earlier. So after a few months, Passover would end up being in the winter and then in the fall and then in the summer until it came back around again to the spring. Therefore, the Jewish calendar has a very complicated system where every few years we add a leap year, but not a leap year like in the regular calendar where it's one extra day, we add a full month. So we end up with a year that has 13 months in a leap year instead of 12. All for this one reason, because Passover always has to be in the spring. So the million dollar question, and that will be the entry point into our prayer today, is why? Why did God care so much that Passover should always fall in the spring? To the point that we tinker with our calendar to make sure that it stays in the spring, that the holiday of liberation should be always in the month of spring. Well, I'd like that ask you all to rise for prayer now as we pray and reflect on this idea of the spring. Mr. Speaker and the esteemed members of the Georgia State House, our father in heaven is teaching us something extremely important about freedom and liberty, the foundations upon which our great republic was founded. What does the spring represent? Honourable speaker and esteemed members of the house. As we gather today in this chamber, I offer a reflection rooted in the spirit of renewal and hope that comes with the season of spring and the observance of Passover. Passover, a time of remembrance and freedom, invites us to reflect on the journey of the Israelites from bondage to liberation. It is a season that marks not only the liberation of people, but also the renewal of life itself. Just as the plants awaken from their winter rest in the spring, blossoming into vibrant new growth, so too can we embrace the opportunity to renew our commitments to justice, peace, and the well-being of our people. Spring reminds us that from the coldest and darkest of times, life finds a way to bloom again. It is a time to sow seeds of kindness, compassion, and progress for the future. Just as the earth comes alive with new growth, let us also plant the seeds of positive changes in our hearts and in our work, nurturing them with wisdom and care. So let us pray that we in our roles as leaders and servants of the people, draw inspiration from the season of renewal, embracing the promise of new beginnings and the hope that each day offers. Let this time of Passover remind us of our shared humanity, our capacity for transformation, and our duty to lift up those in need. May our work in this house be guided by the spirit of liberation, renewal, and growth, and may it be your fruit for the prosperity and peace for all Georgians, amen. And now please join me in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Thank you. Thank you, Rabbi Hirschby. We appreciate your presence here with us and appreciate your service to your community and to the state. And thank you for that lesson this morning. We're all about history in this historical place here, and we're looking forward to a wonderful Passover. Doorkeepers, you may unlock the doors, memories you may join the Rabbi in the south any room for a photo. And thank you for his service to us here today.

This bill I refer to the committee on education. That committee recommends this bill do pass by rules committee substitute. Representative Holt Persinger is recognized to present the bill. Representative Persinger. Thank you Mr. Speaker. This is a rule substitute on Senate Bill 17. I'm also known as Ricky's and Alyssa's Law. This is just clarifying language online 57 under the verification for accuracy for the mapping. We just added relevant public safety agencies, school safety personnel and school administrators on the list of people that can sign off on the accuracy annually so that they've just recently adopted mapping that they can go ahead and sign off on that again. That's the change in the bill. I just ask for your favorable consideration and I'll stand for questions. Representative Ramon up the Suner out to your left. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Does it gem in yield? I will. Thank you. Just really quickly have there been any providers of this kind of technology and how has it worked in other places? We currently have this in our school safety plans. This is just clearing up language to make sure that if they just recently adopted their mapping that they're using now that's required under our school safety plans. I believe we passed in 23 that the school administrators can sign off on that. If there's been no change in the building. Does it in the government for their yields? Yes. Just to clarify. Is it the same contractor provider for all of the schools or is it multiple and we're just trying to get them to talk to each other better? I believe the schools can hire different agencies depending on who they want to use. It's probably put out for our RFP. Got it. Thank you. The representative, Chairman Parsons to your left has recognized for a question. Thanks, Speaker. It's a gem in yield. I do. Yes, I want to ask you about section four. It says here that the, I said if I'm looking at this correctly, that the school systems, each school system will implement this mobile planning alert system capable of and it describes what it's capable of. And then, let's see, on the last page, if I can find it here. The last page that it has 74 through 80, it says that the local boards of education, the local school systems, local governments and agencies and it goes on saying, boys and school boards and education, boards of education, local school systems. And so one will be exempt, will be immune for many civil liability for any damages arising out of the creation of this. I'm just curious. I mean, how serious is it that we would have to provide immunity for them for I say even using it, using this mapping that has to be, that they are mandated to create? I think if there's any unidentified error in the mapping, it's just helping give coverage to if there's something that something's missing the error in the mapping. Okay. If I may ask one more question. Sure. On the section C part four, at, and later July 21st, 206, each public school shall implement the system. And it talks about then says, and the aim is this is alert and shall integrate with technology used in each public, each local public safety answering point included, including but not limited to next generation 911. I know that we passed legislation earlier this year that allows the state creates the ability for the state to use that, but it has not been actually designed. We haven't done anything in code to say exactly what that 911, the next generation 911 system actually is. We've got a study committee, I think that it's pending to be created for the summer, but it says it'll be, we don't even know what that is, how do we put that in code? It's going to integrate with that. If we haven't even described what it is yet. I think it's, I think this is just looking forward in case that passes or gets done that this will already be covered. All right. Well, thank you. Thank you for answering that. Gentlemen has one more question. Will part, did you have a question? Gentlemen's recognize for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does gentleman yield? That do. To the author, I appreciate the intent of having a school mapping data. One question that did come to mind is how is this information going to be secured, just because we're creating critically important information, which if by a hacker, if they access that, could that then expose the school to additional vulnerability, speaking again to the immunity aspect of it? Can you provide any additional context with respect to how this information would be protected after it's compiled? It's already protected. You know, this is already, this, we passed this in this school safety bill. This is just the amendment and cleanup. But all that information is protected at the local agencies. By getting everything is vulnerable. You know, additional encryption requirements, things of that nature. That's not written into the bill. I'm sorry. I don't think it's written into the bill, but that's. This is currently happening from our school safety bill. The school safety plans would pass in 23. So whatever is in 23 would be what applies? Just a note there then, you know, perhaps again, to ensure that this information is protected, whether it's by rule regulation or additional legislation, that again, we are taking action to ensure that this information cannot be easily accessible. Well, I know it's not subject to open records request. Of course, thank you. But George Lee left, Straice has recognized for a question. Thank you Mr. Speakers, Jim and Neil. I do. Sir, is it not true that school records, particularly student records and school security records, are subject to protections already, which are implemented at the local level to ensure that data, that sensitive records that security information is secured to the extent that's possible under IT standards from hack or from falling into the wrong hands. Yes, I feel the correct. Thank you. And isn't it true that SB 17 is an effort to make sure that law enforcement and emergency personnel have the information that they need to effectively do their jobs? Bill, you know what he speaks. I've never heard their questions. Thank you. Gentlemen, is he old enough to see, take another question. Are you the one? Gentlemen, is he old to the well? We do have a speaker on the bill. Representative Betsy Highland has recognized to speak to the bill. Representative Holland, give the lady your attention please. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I rise today in support of SB 17. As most of you know, I have a middle schooler at home and many of you got to meet him on crossover day when he was living his best life as a page all the way to 11 o'clock when we got to go home. Having a middle schooler gives me a different perspective on school safety measures. Fire drills and tornado drills were the norm for most of us growing up. Active shooter drills and lockdowns have been the norm for him since kindergarten. I can't explain what the emotion is when you're on a group text with other school parents. And someone texts and says the school is on lockdown. Does anyone know why? And it doesn't feel like you breathe until somebody responds back and says it was a false alarm or I've heard the all clear. When the shooting happened, at Appalachia High School last fall, I waited a day or two before I asked my child if he had heard the news and asked him how it felt. I asked him if it made it feel scary or if it made him feel anxious. And he said no mom, that school only had one resource officer. Our school has two when an active shooter comes we're going to be better prepared. That was the day I realized that my child uses the word win, not if when he thinks about an active shooter coming to his school. I sometimes have heartburn about the details in the school safety bills but I've put that aside in hoping I can just tell my child that we will make sure his school is prepared as possible if a bad actor comes on campus. I wish with all my heart I could go home tonight and say what we did today was past meaningful gun safety reform to try to prevent school shootings in the first place. But we'll get there. We're just not there today. Instead I'll go home and say once again we did everything we could to try to make sure his school was safe if a bad actor should ever come on campus.

This bill amateurs for the committee on regulated industries that committee recommends this bill do pass by rules committee substitute. Chair lady Kati excuse me Kati I know you Kati Dips is recognized to present the bill. Ladies recognized. Thank you Mr. Speaker. You have on your desk rules substitute to Senate Bill 131 the language from the previous bill has been replaced. This is the exact language exact measure that we voted on on March the 3rd and passed this house by a vote of 170 to 2. It was house bill 612 which deals with parity a very important issue to this house always. It does two things basically. It will add the commissioner the insurance commissioner as a member of the behavioral health coordinator council and it will also establish a parity compliance review panel of 10 who will be able to help us move the ball forward on parity. There is great concern that reports are not reaching the place where we need them to be so it will serve as data collection and have the opportunity for this panel to develop the reporting system that will actually help them evaluate the reported concerns. Mr. Speaker that is what it does if there are any questions I will be glad to take them if not I will yield the well. The lady has a question will part to your left right in front. The gentleman is recognized. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Chair lady Dems I look forward to voting yes for this bill. Quick question then on lines 95 and 96 as I've been doing an additional review it says this new panel will have no authority to impose financial penalties. I recognize the effort to create an incentive to report as opposed to a penalty. However in the event that we continue to see a lack of reporting even with these sorts of incentives and efforts to encourage is there some sort of enforcement mechanism or a state agency that could proceed with enforcement if again parity is not being met. The panel will be under the auspices of the behavioral health system as I understand it they will be reviewing and trying to move that forward. I do not believe that they will they will establish the procedures and policies when they get started so that is how I understand the measure. Thank you. Lady Yule for another question. Yes sir. Representative Oliver to your left is recognized for question. Does it let you? Yes I certainly do. The purpose of this bill is to highlight and bring forward real data. We're not getting that data in a consistent way from the insurance commissioner as we mandated in 1013 so this is a good step forward isn't it true. To bring the data forward we can really understand who is going to compliance and who is not in compliance with true parity is required by law. The lady is correct and knows exactly of what she speaks. Thank you. Lady has no further questions. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I yield the well and ask for your favorable support once again to move this ball forward. The lady has yielded the well.
