a\nlist of speakers here today we'll open\nit up to public comment at later\nmeetings but uh\nDean we'll turn it over to you good\nmorning thank you for having us here uh\nfirst off I appreciate the opportunity\nto speak I want to give you greeting\nfrom our brand new commissioner Russell\nCarlson and Russell lepin taking on that\nrole uh\ngave me the the uh honor of uh\noverseeing the our office of rural\nHealth out of cordial and those are the\nfolks that are going to be presenting\nhere today I'm going to let Brandi\nintroduce them but chairman Hatchett\ngave me the permission to get off Target\nfor just a minute to just make an\nannouncement there's several people in\nthis room that are on my list to call\nand remind there's a process called\nrevalidation that it that the state has\nto do for anybody that's a Medicaid\nprovider and revalidation basically\nmeans you're telling CMS and the state\nthat you still want to participate in\nthe Medicaid Program and that you\nhaven't committed a felony since the the\nlast time you were validating that\nyou're still eligible to be a Medicaid\nprovider and and it's a just one of\nthose nuisance things if you're a\nphysician working in a hospital and\nwe've got a few around here\nyou're Dan somewhere there he is uh you\nknow even though we've been in the same\nplace for for 30 years every three years\nwe have to fill out paperwork and remind\npeople that we still want to participate\nin in the in the hospital\nworld and sign all of those affidavits\nsaying that you're you're still eligible\nto be a hospital member so it's not not\nan unusual process but\nas of the first of August there were\nstill 70 000 providers in Georgia that\nhad not done their revalidation so some\nof those are multiple practice sites so\neach site has to be revalidated on its\nown you can't do it one time\nand we just want to remind everybody\nthat deadline is September 15th and if\nyou don't revalidate and you Bill\nMedicaid that claim will be denied so\nyou know there is a financial\ncost to this if you don't take that 15\nminutes to go in the system and and\nrevalidate so just wanted to anybody\nthat has contacts in that provider World\nmake sure you get the word out that that\nneeds to be accomplished in that the the\ndeadlines quickly approaching so\num but go into the to the subject matter\nof today uh obviously you know my career\nuh in in medical practice was in rural\npart of Georgia and then my service in\nthe Senate that was always a primary\npassion of mine and so this subject\nmatters dear to my heart and I I really\ndo appreciate your taking on this this\nuh very very challenging uh role this is\nnot a simple solution uh Workforce\nissues are broad around the country in\nall Fields but obviously in health care\nit's got particular ramifications that\nmaybe others don't so thank you all for\nthat and with that I'm going to\nintroduce Brandy our government\nrelations director and let her introduce\nour speakers\nsee their presentation even okay\nthank you Dr Burke thank you chairman\nHatchett members of the committee as Dr\nBurke said my name is Brandi Sylvan I\nserve as the government the government\nrelations director at the Department of\nCommunity Health we certainly appreciate\nyou guys taking some time to dive into\nthis topic it's an issue that we hear\nfrom our providers and our members on a\nconsistent basis as being a challenge\nas you were all familiar Governor Kemp\nyou know kind of emphasized his priority\nprioritization of this topic when he\nestablished the healthcare Workforce\nCommission last year\nour DCH commissioner at the time Kaylee\nnoggles served as the chair of that\ncommittee Anita will talk a little bit\nabout some of the recommendations that\ncame out of that Commission\nso Anita Hamm is serves as our senior\ndirector over at the State Office of\nrural Health uh the the government the\nfederal government requires that every\nstate have a State Office of rural\nhealth so ours is in Cordele Georgia\nand a needle will give you a little bit\nof an overview about that office as well\nin their role thank you for having us\nand we'll be happy to answer any\nquestions you have afterwards\nthank you thank you I'm so happy to be\nhere to be able to present information\nto you from the perspective of the State\nOffice of rural health so I just wanted\nto give you a little bit of information\nabout our office\nwe are the State Office of rural Health\nwhich is a division of the Department of\nCommunity Health and as Brandi mentioned\nthis is a requirement of the federal we\nwere funded by a federal program there's\na State Office of rural Health in all 50\nstates and our office was established in\n2000 and as she mentioned we are\npositioned appropriately in cordial\nwhich is in rural Crisp County we have\nfour program sections in the soar office\nthat's the primary care office the\nfarmworker health program Hospital\nservices and the soar program we're a\nsmall office we're a staff of of 10\npeople and we manage six hersa grants\nfor which DCH and soar are actually the\ngrantee and we those grants provide\nfunding for the office management and\nfor salaries for our staff and for other\nprograms okay but our overarching\nresponsibility at the soar office is to\neffectively and efficiently administer\nFederal and state-funded Grant programs\nthat are intended to increase access to\nQuality Health Care improve the quality\nof health services and promote the\nhealth and well-being of our rural\nresidents and so our funding every year\nfluctuates a little bit but in fiscal\nyear 23 we actually managed a little\nover 27 million dollars in our office\nfor Grant funded programs and you can\nsee that it's broken down into a little\nover 9 million of federal dollars and we\nhad about 17.7 and some change in State\ndollars and we're quite a busy little\ngroup I did a account of the active\ngrants we had as we actually went into\nfiscal year 24 and as a July 21st we had\n76 active grants and 18 active contracts\nthat were distributed between and\nmanaged among our four program sections\nso just to give you a little uh history\nabout or a little visual rather on Rural\nGeorgia and this is one of my favorite\nMaps because it's a great visual that\nactually shows just exactly how rural\nGeorgia is so as you know we have 159\ncounties and 120 of those are defined as\nrural having a population of less than\n50 000 but out of all the people that\nlived in Georgia there's only about 26\npercent of Georgia residents that live\noutside of our Urban centers and every\nyear our rural populations continue to\ndecline however we have a higher uh\ndeath rates and death rates for heart\ndisease and stroke and cancer in motor\nvehicle accidents and certainly an\nincreased prevalence of chronic\nconditions so this is my second favorite\nmap which gives you a little visual on\nour rural hospitals so in our 120 rural\ncounties we actually have 67 small Rural\nand critical access hospitals and those\nare broken down into 37 rural PPS\nhospitals and 30 critical access\nHospitals now one of those critical\naccess hospitals actually does reside in\na county that's not defined as rural\nthat's Effingham County and it has a\npopulation greater than 50 000 but we\nstill include that hospital because of\nits cost status now this map also shows\nthat we have 54 counties that do not\nhave hospitals at all so I realize the\nmap's a little bit busy but our rural\nhospitals are identified in green and\npurple and then the counties with the\nred X have no hospital and the reason I\nwanted to point this out is because we\nhave clusters of counties that have no\nhospital anywhere in sight so if you\nnotice toward the\nthe Western sort of central area you can\nsee large clusters of counties with no\nhospitals and then in the bottom of the\nstate in the in the uh Southwestern\nquadrant there we have a rural Hospital\nin every County so having clusters with\nno County no hospitals and clusters of\ncounties with a hospital in every County\nactually creates its own challenges for\nboth Workforce and Health Care access\nso just to to talk a little bit about\nthe workforce as Brandi mentioned I'm\ngoing to lean in a little bit into the\nreport that was provided by the\nworkforce commission and as she\nmentioned this was a established the\ncommission was established last year by\nGovernor Kemp there were 15 members and\nit was chaired by our former\ncommissioner Kaylee noggle so I believe\nthey met each month from July through\nDecember working on this report and what\nI'm actually going to focus on and refer\nback to from time to time is the part of\nthe report that's actually the\ncommission recommendations so as I get\nready to talk about that I do want to\ntell you a little bit more about what\nthe soar office does already to address\nWorkforce issues so as I mentioned one\nof our offices is the primary care\noffice and I actually have the director\nof the primary care office came with me\nBeth Walker is in the back of the room\nand in the handouts that we've provided\nthere's a lot more information about\nwhat they do they actually have a lot of\nresponsibility in the PCO office and I'm\njust going to hit on a few things that\nthey manage but one of the things that\nthe PCO office is responsible for is\nhelp professional shortage area\ndesignations a few other things they\ndeal with is the National Health Service\nCorps program the hersa Georgia state\nloan repayment program they manage the\nConrad 30 J-1 Visa waiver program and\nthen the PCO the soar PCO is actually\nthe designated State administrator for\nthe 3rnet program which is the rural\nRecruitment and Retention Network\nso just to give you a little bit of\ninformation about hipsa or health\nprofessional shortage areas so the\ndefinition by hersa is a shortage of\nprimary care mental health and dental\nhealth providers in a geographic area\npopulation group or facility and their\nspecific criteria scoring criteria in\nwhich they calculate these scores and\nthe scoring criteria includes population\nto provide a ratio the percentage of\npopulation that it's a hundred percent\npoverty level infant Health index based\non infant mortality rate and low birth\nrates and then travel time to the\nnearest source of care so just to give\nyou a quick look at one of our Maps this\nis actually the hipsa score for Rural\nprimary care and this map is rural\nspecific it's awfully colorful but if\nyou'll notice uh sort of focus on the\ntan and the yellow areas so scoring is\nrequired by hersa every three years and\nit's the responsibility of our office to\nupdate those hipsa scores every three\nyears the higher the score the higher\nthe need so this map actually indicates\nthat 88 of our 120 rural counties\nactually scored in the high levels\nbetween 15 and 25. so you may Wonder\nwell what's the purpose of the hipsa\nscores why is that so relevant but those\nscores are actually the nucleus of all\nof these uh Federal programs so some of\nthem I've already mentioned and I'll\nspeak to just in a minute J-1 visa and\nthe National Health Service Corps but\nit's also\nthe hips of score is or the Medicare\nbonus incentive program is dependent on\nthe hips of score as well as the federal\nqualified Health Centers and Rural\nhealth clinics so one of the programs\nthat we manage that I just referenced\nI'll just speak to quickly and that's\nNational Health Service Corps and this\nprogram is really focused on Recruitment\nand Retention so I've divided it into\nthose two sections to kind of explain\nthis map but specific to recruitment if\na site in the state wants to become\napproved an approved National Health\nService course site they work with Beth\nin our office to complete the\napplications and she makes sure that\nthey're complete and then they submit\nthem for approval and when they're\napproved this actually becomes a\nmarketing tool for that site because the\nother half of this nhsc program are loan\nrepayments and scholarship programs and\nif a provider applies for those and is\nsuccessful in getting loan repayment for\ninstance then they have to commit to one\nof those approved sites and they have to\npractice in that site for at least two\nyears and so what's great about nhsc is\nthey have to commit minimum of two years\nbut they can commit a little longer to\ncontinue that loan repayment program but\nwhat the data coming out of nhsc says\nthat if they stay in that area for two\nyears or longer you're looking at\nretention rates of those providers of 80\nto 85 percent so that's really important\nto to look at another program that we're\nmanaging which is also loan repayment is\na new program it's a hersa program that\nis a state-specific loan repayment\nprogram RAM and the providers that are\neligible for this of course are\nPhysicians advanced practice providers\nlicensed clinical social workers and\nprofessional counselors as well as\nregistered nurses now this is not rural\nspecific but\num\nuh if they apply for those loan\nrepayment programs then they have to\ncommit to a particular practice location\nso the practice location for those are\nfederally qualified Health Centers rural\nhealth clinics critical access hospitals\nand then private practices now this is\nnew this program hasn't fleshed out as\nmuch as some of our others so we don't\nhave a lot of participation yet in that\nprogram we only have nine rural counties\nin which we have some of those loan\nrepayment participants and then four\ncounties in which we have participants\nare Urban\nanother program that we manage is the\nConrad 30 J1 Visa waiver program this\nprogram actually allows International\nmedical school graduates who are here in\nour country on J-1 visa to to waive\ntheir two-year home requirement for\nthree years of service in the country in\nin the states So currently in Georgia we\nhave 90 Physicians that are\nparticipating in the J-1 Visa waiver\nprogram unfortunately only 18 of those\nPhysicians are primary care the other 72\nare Specialists and I say unfortunately\nbecause we typically don't attract a lot\nof Specialists into the rural\ncommunities so we have 19 counties in\nwhich these 90 Physicians are hosted and\nagain the majority of them are\nSpecialists so they are located more in\nthe urban areas than in the rural\ncounties\nnow our office offers a lot more than\njust loan repayment and and uh\nscholarship programs we actually have as\nI mentioned when we started FY 24 we had\n76 active grants and those grants if we\nwere to look at all of those grants and\nkind of divide them into buckets we\nsupport our rural Health Care basically\nin these six ways so some of those\nprograms are dedicated to financial and\noperational Improvement which is\ncertainly beneficial for our health care\nfacilities quality improvement\ninitiatives continuing education\ninitiatives service line expansion for\nHospitals and Clinics telemedicine\nprograms and addition of primary care\nclinics in rural areas all of which are\nvery important and the column on the\nright basis basically is some examples\nof those programs that fit into one of\nthose six buckets so we have Revenue\nintegrity and solutions programs Wing\nbed management program patient-centered\nmedical homes we also fund the area\nhealth education center which is really\nthe Statewide wide pipeline for getting\nfolks out of interested in Healthcare\ncareers as they're in middle school and\nhigh school and then we have some unique\nprograms like the electronic Intensive\nCare Program in which we have\nrural hospital icus that are directly\nconnected through\nelectronic means with Emory University\nand have access immediately with\nCritical Care Specialists so we're\nreally proud of all of our programs and\nthere's one more program that I want to\nmention and that is our rural Hospital\nstabilization grant program and I want\nto bring this up not so much to talk\nabout the program but to talk about a\nlot of the information that we get from\nour hospitals who are participating in\nthis program so just to give you a\nlittle back story on the program it's a\nlegislatively directive program that we\nstarted in fiscal year\n2016. we're actually in our eighth year\nof funding and to date we've had 35\nrural hospitals that have participated\nin the program so that's a little over\nhalf of all of our rural hospitals that\nhave been involved in the stabilization\nprogram and some of our hospitals have\nactually participated multiple years\nso far we've invested a little more than\n45 million dollars in that program and\nthose Hospital leaderships many of them\nwill tell you that that funding during\nthat funding period actually made the\ndifference between the hospital being\nable to stay open so we're very proud of\nthat program and currently the\nparticipants in the program grantees are\nselected through a standardized\napplication process and one thing I want\nto mention about that program is that it\nhas very specific goals objectives and\nguidelines so as the hospitals submit\ntheir applications for the program\nbefore those grants are executed they\npresent their proposals their use of\nfunds proposals to our office we review\nwhat they're proposing to ensure that\nthey meet those guidelines and uh and\nthen during the funding period which is\ntypically about one year per funding\ncycle there is a lot of technical\nassistance in interaction with those\nhospitals so they are all brought\ntogether at the beginning when the\ngrants are executed I uh meet with the\nproject managers every quarter I provide\na huge amount of technical assistance\nindividually to those hospitals\nthroughout the funding period and then\nat the end of the funding period we\nbring them all back together and they\nget to present their uh projects to each\nother and talk about some of those\nsuccesses as well as challenges and\nshare some of the things that worked for\nthem so that other hospitals can\nconsider some of those initiatives\nthemselves so I bring this up because I\nwanted to mention some of the benefits\nthat we have found not so much about the\nfunding itself but about some of the\nthings this program has taught us so the\nbenefit to the grantee is that we\nrecognize the uniqueness of each rural\ncommunity and if I've learned nothing in\nthe 10 years that I have been at the\nState Office of rural health is that no\ntwo communities are alike they may be\nvery similar through demographics or in\ntheir geographical location patient but\nthey're all very very different and\nsolutions to their problems are usually\nvery individualized also one of the\nother requirements for this grant\nprogram is that they are required to\nhave Community engagement in order to\ntake the funds they have to engage their\ncommunities in the early years of the\nprogram it was a little bit\nuncomfortable because our hospitals were\nvery used to working in silos but once\nthey were required to get out into their\ncommunity and to re-establish\nrelationships and sometimes repair some\nsome reputations and actually get\ninvolved with the community and let the\ncommunity have a voice in how those\nfunds are used the the difference has\nbeen enormous and many of our hospitals\nsay that that particular piece of this\nprogram the community engagement and the\nreconnection with their communities has\nreally been very very successful\nHospital leaders one of the other things\nthat this program has proven is the\nhospital leadership really is best to\ndetermine the prioritization in the\ndirection of their funding based on\ntheir individual needs so again when\nthey apply for the program they have to\nprovide us with data and stats and they\nhave to explain to us what internal\nresources they use to make the decision\non how they wanted to use their funding\nso we actually have a little Glimpse as\nto what their decision-making process is\nbut we leave a lot of those decisions up\nto the hospital of how best those funds\nwould be used now the benefit to our\noffice in the last eight years during\nthis program has been enormous because\nwhat we have done through this program\nhas established some really really\nstrong relationships with these\nhospitals and their communities so we\nhave gotten to see the struggles and to\nsee their needs through their eyes by\nbeing so connected with them through\nthis program\nit also has engaged our staff in rural\nHealth Care problem identification and\nrecognition and it encourages a very\nforward-thinking solutions-based\napproach to new initiatives that may be\noffered through our office especially\nwhen we have new funding and we can look\nat what those hospitals need and direct\nthose fund that funding into appropriate\nways so it really helps keep us in the\nknow\nforeign\na couple of things I wanted to mention\nabout two meetings that I've had with\nour hospitals over the last couple of\nyears in May of 2022 we were ending we\nwere getting close to the end of what I\nrefer to as phase six the sixth cohort\nof grantees that we had in the program\nand that year was unique because we had\nthe largest number of hospitals\nparticipating in the program to date we\nactually had 16 hospitals participating\nand you can they're identified on the\nmap so you can see we had a good\nscattering of hospitals across the state\nnorth to south and as we were getting\nready to bring them back together we\nthought we've got a really unique\nopportunity here because we've got\nalmost a quarter of all of our rural\nhospitals participating in this phase so\nwhen we bring them back together we can\nreally do a deep dive and collect a lot\nof information from those Hospital\nleaders as we bring them into a very\nintense two-day workshop locking the\ndoors so they couldn't leave and we\ncould take make the best use of of their\ntime time so we decided this would be\ngreat opportunity for us to offer a very\ndetailed survey as well as break them\ninto small groups and Mercer staff as\nwell as drafted and Tucker accounting\nfirm worked with us to develop the\nworkshop so we partnered with Mercer to\ndesign our survey and they also ensured\nthat it was valid survey there was a\ntotal of 127 questions that were divided\nbetween 12 categories and the number of\nquestions per category ranged from 4 to\n32 they were presented randomly so we\nwere not driving anyone's\nresponses in any direction presented in\na likert scale and it was all real time\nso as they sat there for a hundred and\ntwenty seven survey questions they were\nable to see the questions as a group and\nthen respond to the questions as a group\nand see where their responses fell so we\nhad about 45 leaders that were all in\nthe room at the same time CEO CFOs cnos\nproject Managers from representing those\n16 house hospitals and what we really\nwanted to know at the end of that the\nsurvey and through those small group\ndiscussions is what are the top five\nthings that our rural Hospital needs and\nso from their mouths to you these are\nwhat they said were their priorities and\ntheir challenges for the uh for these\nrural hospitals so number one is just\ncash cash flow cash on hand cash\nreserves it was just cash and then the\nnext three bullet points are all focused\non Staffing so it was finding them and\nkeeping them and keeping the costs down\nbecause in 22 we were coming off the\nheels of covid and so many of our\nhospitals were financially stressed\nduring that period just trying to pay\nthe high costs of Staffing services so\num and then at the the fifth bullet\npoint there is keeping and increasing\ntheir market share because that's what's\nimportant to those rural communities\nthat's why the community engagement\npiece was so important you want to keep\nthose rural residents come coming to\ntheir local hospitals for their care and\nprevent the out migration where they're\ngoing two or three counties over so we\nwanted to make sure that they have the\nmoney to keep their doors open and that\nthey have the staff to serve their\npatients because they certainly want to\nmake sure that their communities are\nusing their Hospitals now in July of\n2023 not too long ago we brought in the\nseventh group of 10 different hospitals\nand we basically had the same response\nthe only difference for that group is\nthat those hospitals during 2023 had\nbegun to wean themselves off of those\nhigh-cost Staffing Services they were\nbeginning to get a little bit stable in\nthat respect but that was still weaning\noff of those high cost Services was\nstill as a result of very very\naggressive Recruitment and Retention\nefforts so that's what the hospitals\nhave brought up to us and certainly\nrecruitment is one of the Recruitment\nand Retention is one of their big issues\nso now I'm going to lean back against\nthe Workforce Commission\ndocument a couple of things that I had\nfound in that document that I thought\nwas very interesting George's growing\ndemands for health care services are\nprimarily driven by overall population\ngrowth but remember that's not the case\nin our rural areas because that\npopulations in the rural areas are\ndeclining every year and then the Aging\npopulation so residents over uh the age\nof 65 are growing faster in Georgia than\nin any other state and certainly the\nlarge majority of our residents in rural\nareas are greater than 65 and then of\ncourse this leads to the increase of\ndisease burden which certainly speaks to\nthe need for higher engagement of those\nHealth Care Professionals a couple of\nother interesting things that were\npointed out in the workforce is that the\nworkforce itself is trained largely by\npublic and private post-secondary\ninstitutions and 50 percent of our\nhealth care are actually being trained\nof the healthcare graduates are actually\ncoming out of 20 institutions enjoy\nGeorgia only retains a little more than\nhalf of those Health Care graduates so\nwe're losing 3.7 workers each year by\nnot that are not replaced by those\ngraduates so when you look at the\ninformation that's provided in that\nWorkforce report and then you go back to\nthe information that we're collecting\nfrom our hospitals as they sit with us\naround the table and talk about their\nstruggles one of the things we talked\nabout is their current Workforce status\nso these are the folks that are\ncurrently working for them two things\none is that that Workforce does want\nmarket analysis salary adjustments and\ncompetitive hourly rates they see the\nRecruitment and recruitment efforts to\nbring in new staff with\nsign-on bonuses and all of the dollars\nthat they're throwing at getting new\nstaff and so you've got your loyal staff\nthat are sitting there saying what about\nus we want fair market rates and we want\nretention bonuses we stuck with you\nthrough kovid so we want to be rewarded\nin that some some way so again in trying\nto balance that out it's causing\nFinancial stress on the hospitals and\nthere's still the coast povid postcovid\nburnout\nwe were never at fully staffed in\nespecially in our rural areas prior to\ncovid but certainly after covid those\nStaffing struggles have continued to\nincrease and the workloads are intense\nthere's just the physical and emotional\ntoll because everybody's just very tired\nand another interesting point to make is\nthat 20 percent of our current Workforce\nare greater than 55 years old so even if\nthey stick with their jobs in those\nrural hospitals until they decide to\nretire we're going to lose a lot of\nfolks just from through retirement now\nwhen we talk about the younger Workforce\nand that was definitely a popular\nconversation in our Hospital meetings\nbecause the younger Workforce is very is\nmotivated very differently than my\ngeneration and they are more interested\nin the highest hour relate hourly rate\npossible and not so much interested in\nbenefits packages and they're not\nusually coming to work for you because\nthey're looking forward to that\nretirement dinner in the gold watch so\nthey're not going to stick around nearly\nas long as they used to our hospitals\ntell us that they feel very fortunate if\nthey get a new uh incoming employee that\nstays with them for a couple of years\nwhich may mean at some point in the near\nfuture we need to redefine our\ndefinition of retention and start\nworking toward new retention initiatives\nwith a different expectation so they're\nalso very very interested in flexible\nschedules they really focus more on\ntheir work like work life balance so\nthey're very interested in kind of\ntailor-made schedules that we'll work\nwith their personal lives and they are\ninterested in continuing education so\nthey're very much want to expand their\nfund of knowledge and skill set but keep\nin mind continuing education provided to\nthem makes them much more appealing when\nthey decide to go look for another job\nat another Hospital\nso they did tell us though that employee\nsatisfaction is not always about\nsalaries that definitely some of the\ninformation they've gotten back during\nsatisfaction surveys and in talking with\ntheir staff is that the quality of\nsupervision and management is extremely\nimportant and they really want updated\nfacilities and Equipment they want to\nfeel like they work for a facility that\nhas uh that is equal to those larger\nhospitals in the urban areas so they\nlove having updated facilities and\nEquipment Cutting Edge\nenvironment they want positive\nenvironments to work in comfortable\nbreak areas and for those that are\nplanning to stick around for a while\nthey're also seeking promotion\nopportunities within the hospital and\nagain flexible schedules is very\nimportant to them so they feel that\npersonal satisfaction professional\nsatisfaction in working with those\nhospitals is really about feeling valued\nand respected by the leadership they\nwant to be involved in the decision\nmaking and as our hospitals got their\nstabilization grants they often involved\ntheir staff and their uh their\nsupervisors in making decisions about\nhow to use those funds\nso going back to some commission\nrecommendations now that we've sort of\nuh spoken on behalf of the hospitals as\nfar as what they're needing\nrecommendations by the um the workforce\nstudy is specific to optimizing the\num current Healthcare education system\nbecause if we're looking for new staff\nthat's where they are they're going to\nbe educated somewhere and that's who\nwe're going to be tapping into or those\nfolks who are not yet in those programs\nor in the programs with the potential to\ngrab graduate pretty quickly so looking\nat Quick Start programs for Health Care\nis certainly an option exploring earn to\nlearn programs looking at faculty\nincentives and then as far as attracting\nnew workers optimizing marketing and\ndual enrollment opportunities for\nhealthcare fields for high school\nstudents and then creating additional\nscholarship programs other than what we\nalready have on the table for health\ncare\nso again when you go back and look at\nthe conversations that are going on with\nthe hospitals they agree with all that\nthey realize that their Workforce is\nright there in their community in high\nschool or in their local educational\ninstitutions and the technical college\nsystem is very widespread especially in\nthe rural areas the Techno colleges are\npretty easy access and they value those\nTechnical College Programs the nurses\nthat are coming out of the LPN programs\nand the two-year RN programs are just as\nvaluable to them not to devalue\nfour-year programs or\num or any graduate programs but they\nneed Workforce quickly and they\nrecognize that that's where their\nWorkforce is they're in the high schools\nin their own community and those\ntechnical colleges produce a wide\nvariety of other Allied Health programs\nand they need that staff too\nso they also agree that it's important\nfor them as a community to support those\nquick start Pathways such as the work\nbased learning College and Career\nacademies which are part of the\ntechnical colleges are very popular in\nsome of our areas and that's really\nwhere they're building strong\nrelationships dual enrollment programs\nnow you can tell I'm not I'm not a\nyoungin so sometimes I get a little\nnervous that we've got kids coming right\nout of high school that have LPN license\nand are going right into the hospital to\nstart practicing and but that's what we\nneed we've got to get people into the\nhospital as quick as possible so they\nrecognize that they have to grow their\nown and because they've developed these\nCommunity these relationships with their\ncommunities and when their schools these\nLocal Schools they're getting out and\nbeing visible they're having Community\nengagement initiatives they recognize\nthat they've got to get engaged they've\ngot to\nset up community events that are going\nto bring these young folks in they need\nto go be present in the high schools\narrange Hospital tours we've got some\npictures the the folks that are all in\ntheir ppe's up there in the top are all\nhigh school students that were at one of\nour hospitals for a tour and then the\nhealth fairs is another way but\nhospitals recognize they've got to be\ncreative they've got to keep up with\nthese young folks and they've got to get\nthem interested in health care there's a\nlot of other competing professions for\nour young Workforce so we've got to make\nHealth Care sexy so that they're going\nto want to be part of the healthcare\nWorkforce Now I know this is a broader\npicture than just health care so to give\nyou a list of some of the things our\noffice always deals with that are\nbarriers to health care in rural\ncommunities there's the ongoing\nconversations about Transportation\nchallenges and I'm not talking about\njust Emergency Medical Services\nTransportation challenges that's a whole\nother conversation but this is just\ntransportation to and from a doctor's\nappointment or someone that gets\ndischarged from the hospital and then\ndoesn't have a way home so certainly\nthose are huge barriers in being able to\nkeep our rural residents healthy\nbroadband and connectivity is another\nchallenge we still have pockets in rural\nareas where connectivity is very poor\nand as we lean more and more toward\nsolving some of our health care problems\nin rural areas with telemedicine it's so\nimportant that broadband and\nconnectivity be accessible and available\nand that we can continue to provide\nthose connections with specialist\nPhysicians or Physicians that are not\nwithin a community through telemedicine\nso we need some work in our connectivity\nin rural areas and then just in general\nlack of business and industry growth as\nour rural communities dwindle and the\nbusinesses dwindle it's really difficult\nto attract new providers into rural\nareas and to attract young families into\nrural areas and that's really what we\nneed and of course nutrition is very\npoor we have lots of food deserts in our\nrural communities so all of this of\ncourse contributes to our problems with\num\nQuality Health Care in rural areas and\nour shrinking rural population certainly\ndoesn't help\nso in summary what I would like to say\nto all of you is that our rural\ncommunities are really resilient and\nresourceful and our rural Health Care\nleaders especially in the last decade\nhave really gotten skilled at\nprioritizing needs and dollars and they\nare having to play the Shell Games\nsometimes they've got more needs than\nthey have dollars but they have to\nfigure out what is the best use of those\nfunds and what we've really learned is\nthat a lot of the solutions to these\nchallenges are very Community specific\nso the recommendations have been\nprovided not just by the Workforce\nCommission but by a lot of other\nresearch and other reports that are out\nthere the communities just need to take\nthese recommendations and develop action\nplans but we know that if they're given\nfunding and objectives and guidelines\nthese rural hospitals in these rural\ncommunities very often can figure it out\nso just to personalize this a little bit\nI've got a couple of pictures of some of\nour rural Hospital leaders in some\nrecent meetings that we had in the last\nfew in the last several months so they\nare all ready and willing to take on the\nchallenge and as hard as it is they keep\nshowing up every day and going at it\nagain\nnext slide\nso that is it for the State Office of\nrural health and I want to tell you\nagain how much I appreciate this\nopportunity on my behalf as well as Beth\nWalker my partner in crime in the back\nof the room who is the director of the\nprimary care office and does a lot of\nthat work that I had mentioned at the\nbeginning of the presentation so thank\nyou very much well thank you for that\npresentation and I want to open up\nquestions I know Senator Patrick may\nhave one thank you very much for your\npresentation very thorough and much\nappreciated my question has to do with\nsomething that always bothers me about\nstate government ever since I got here\nand that is the silos that we work in\nand so I'm the question that came to my\nmind while you were speaking is how does\nhersa grant funding fit together with\nthe healthcare Workforce board which of\ncourse is a separate\nentity than the healthcare Workforce\nCommission I just want to make sure\neverybody's working together and was\ncurious about how you're making sure\nthat it happens\nright and I am not sure how many hersa\nfunded programs the workforce board\nactually\num manages but you are correct we have\nto get together so that we can see what\nwe're doing and not duplicate or\nreplicate uh uh initiatives that are out\nthere and our goal in the near future is\nto break down these silos Dr Burke and I\nhave been talking about that in the last\nseveral months because we don't need to\nbe tugging on opposite end of the Rope\nwe need to look at this as a relay race\nso that we're all running in the same\ndirection for the same reasons so yes we\ndo we are are and Beth can probably\nspeak to that a little better than I can\nshe has more re um working of a working\nrelationship with the healthcare\nWorkforce but we are definitely planning\nto work with them so that we can compare\nnotes as we move forward with these help\nWorkforce initiatives\nchair thanks for your Folsom\npresentation uh and all the\ndocumentation I I had some kind of small\nquestions and maybe some overarching\nones\num\nI guess I'll start with the the hips\nhips of scores 88 of 120 rural counties\nscore between 15 and 25 but what's\nwhat's the larger picture what the score\nwhat's the table of scoring and what\nwhat does 25 mean in the in the world is\nthese score scores 25 is the highest\nbased on that scoring calculation that I\nhad mentioned earlier so that would be\nthe highest need for Primary Care\nProviders uh of the highest need not the\nnot the highest performing correct the\nhighest need so those 88 counties that\nare scoring between 15 and 25 are\ndemonstrating the highest need for\nphysicians in those areas\nthank you that's helpful\num the National Health Service Corps how\ncompetitive is that approval process you\ndescribed working with with hospitals to\nget get get the applications completed\nand uh do a lot of them get declined\ndoes we get 100 acceptance or uh\nhow are we standing with working with\nthat program National Health Service\nCorps well Beth is actually the um the\ndirector over that program so if you\ndon't mind I'm going to let her address\nthat particular question thank you\nyes we work very closely with all you\nwill you pass through the microphone so\nthat we can because we're streaming\nthank you now is that better that's\nbetter thank you okay we work very\nclosely my office does especially myself\nwe work with the uh sites to get them\nNational Health Service Corps approved\nslides and I would say in Georgia 85 to\n90 percent get approved and then when\nthe next application cycle rolls around\nthey can reapply for approval if they\ndon't get in the first time and\num then the funding for National Health\nService Corps\nwe take what the federal government\ngives the recipients and we score from\nthe highest knee down so they start with\na 25 which is your primary care and then\nthey fund those programs till the funds\nare exhausted but they usually confined\ndown to about a 14 hips a score for\nanybody that's interested in loan\nrepayment\nand and and so\nwhat's the out the final result in any\ngiven year I mean how many nhsc uh\npeople are in our state working in these\nsettings right now we have over 200\nrecipients in rural counties that are\nreceiving National Health Service Corps\nloan repayment\nand total funding for National Health\nService Corps for um\n2022 was over 14 million dollars Federal\nFederal funding that's correct Federal\nfunding uh-huh\nand and you pointed out that the people\ncommit beyond the two years they're uh\nputting down Roots typically and and you\ncan count on a good retention rate\nuh when they learn the charms of small\ntown Americans right\num but that that is there more\nopportunity there for us is that is that\na place that that we can see growth if\nwe've leaned in on it absolutely we sure\ncan and the\nand my goal is to get the word out to\nthese eligible sites like critical\naccess hospitals to take advantage of\nthis program and we also have the nurse\nCorps uh program that's federally funded\nand RNs and aprns can apply for loan\nrepayment so I want more critical access\nhospitals to take advantage of the\nNational Health Service Corps so that\nthey can benefit from this recruitment\nprogram\nso that would be a place for us to look\nfor ways to help drive that\nparticipation rate up yes ma'am uh\nnothing nothing spins as good as Federal\nmoney that not eating entire\num and\nthe rural Hospital stabilization grant\nprogram\nthank you so much for your\nnow now this is this is where\ncontributions get made why don't you\nbreak that down a little bit on the\nstabilization grant program how that so\nthat's State dollars that's right and\num so exactly and so we look at the\ndollar amount uh that we get every year\nwhich does fluctuate a little bit and\nwhat we've learned in the first five\nyears of the program where our fundings\ndollar amount per hospital\num sort of went up and down is that uh\nthe The Sweet Spot so to speak of\nfunding for hospitals to be able to do\nsomething really productive with the\nfunding is somewhere between 750 and 900\n000 per hospital so depending on the\namount of funding we look at how if we\nstayed in that range how many hospitals\ncould we support and then every year we\ndetermine the number of awards based on\nthe total number of funding\num and breaking it down dividing it up\ninto the number of hospitals that would\ngive them somewhere in the 750 or 800\n000 what are we putting in annually\nit fluctuates when we had the 16\nhospitals in phase six we had 15 million\nthat had gone into that funding for that\nyear it dropped to 9 million the next\nyear and we're currently for FY 23 funds\nwhich is what we've just opened up we're\nat seven million dollars and then I\nthink in FY 24 we've dropped down to two\nmillion dollars in the in the budget so\nthe programs so the program is not\nworking is it if we keep on cutting the\nmoney are we is the money being you\ndidn't cut the money I know there are\npeople that we all know who cut the\nmoney but\nbut it was is that a measure of it being\nan ineffective program therefore uh the\nmoney's reduced or I would maybe want to\nlook at Dr Burke to speak to that a\nlittle bit he does have a knowledge of\nthat\nuh well you know\nI think there was a lot of\nI wouldn't say confusion but the the\nDPP program that that came in this year\nit was one of those kind of we're giving\nmoney from this this hand so maybe we'll\nwe'll lower a little bit from this other\nhand so uh I don't think there's any\ndoubt that the the hospital\nstabilization money goes to good use and\nthat it's been a very very successful\nprogram\nuh it's just a matter of\npriorities and in making sure that that\nuh\nthe\nI don't think anybody wants to uh\ngive money where it's not needed\nuh but but I don't think the the rural\nhospital system is\nis there yet I mean they're they're not\nfresh yeah\nright so that again that's so that\nthat's something to make to highlight of\nlooking at uh you know reinvesting uh in\nthat area and and\nhelping us connect the dots on how that\nhow that addresses retention and new new\nblood and so on and so forth uh would be\nhelpful uh it's the other question I had\nis that\nthe 45 leaders from 16 hospitals that\nyou convened and\nlocked in a room congratulations\nuh\ncash was their number one\ndid any of them connect the dots about\nthat there's all this Federal money if\nwe expanded medicaid that would come\ndown into our state coffers and into our\nhealth system\nit was part of the discussion\num that uh that two-day workshop had\nsome very specific focus on uh in the\nsmall group discussions and that really\nwas not one of the topics that had been\nbrought to the group to discuss so I\nreally can't answer whether that was on\nthe minds of those folks it just wasn't\nsomething we discussed during that\nparticular Workshop\nwell there's a lot of money on the table\nup there and other states are getting\nour tax dollars uh uh finally and I'll\nstop thank you Mr chair\nbut you gave us a lot to think about and\nand a lot to drill down on\ndid this does the certificate of need\nuh\nyes she said it there's a certificate of\nneed debate\num come into play here\num\nthis whole thing of retaining your\nretaining your patient base and\ndelivering services to the the folks uh\nyou know in your locality\num and\nhas that has that surfaced in terms of\nthe plight of rural hospitals the\nchallenges that they're facing\nthe soar office really doesn't have\nwe're not really engaged with\nconversations related to that that those\nconversations go on in other areas of\nDCH so that's not something that's\nreally on the radar screen in our office\nso it's not something that we we\nactively discussed yeah yeah and I don't\nI'm asking a question that I don't know\nthe answer to you know how real or how\nimaginary is that uh is that issue for\nthese hospitals and finally uh Georgia\nretains 58 percent of Health Care\ngraduates that's really worth drilling\ndown on and and under where are they\ngoing they're leaving the state\nI mean that would be a fascinating focus\ngroup wouldn't it if you could ever\nget people to look back over their\nshoulder long enough to tell you or\nabsolutely or as they as they leave and\npeople believe for all about you know\nchanging their address in their state\nfor all kinds of reasons but that would\nseem to be a really important and sweet\nspot to write what I did not see in the\nreport was if there was a a line drawn\nbetween out-of-state students who may\nhave come into Georgia for their\neducation and then left to go back to\ntheir home States I did not see that\nactually outlined in the in the study so\nthat may actually play a a role in why\nwe lose so many Health Care graduates we\ndidn't talk about this later because\nI've had more than my share of the time\nbut ahac whether you know how that how\nthat's going because that's a real\neffort that's been underway for some\ntime I think Senator Jackson has one\nquestion in there I'm going to lay this\nmicrophone down thank you so much\nyeah we we're going to try to stay on\nschedule here\num with the number of people that we\nhave we've allotted up roughly 30\nminutes for each presentation so I'm\ngoing to let Center Jackson and then\nSenator Walker and then we'll move on to\nthe next presentation\nthank you Mr chairman thank you for this\num really comprehensive presentation uh\njust briefly in our packet you have a\nmap here about Mental Health Access but\nyou didn't really speak to that and so\nI'm curious can you talk about our\nWorkforce needs in rural areas as it\nrelates to mental health I will I'm\ngoing to pass the torch back to Beth and\nuh yes for sake of time I didn't address\nall of those maps that we had in there\nbut there is some additional information\nso Beth maybe you just want to come up\nhere\nit's all green that's what I'm like it\nis that's uh and it's very\nin your face as far as the green too so\nyou can definitely see the need in the\nstate I know this is a very complex\nquestion here with the mental health\nissues we're facing and I hate to say it\nbut as as briefly as you can address\nthis issue right now we have others that\nneed to present and we're already a\nlittle bit behind schedule so I got to\nkeep this train on the tracks here okay\nwell as you can see in the state\npresently\n94.97 of the state is in a mental health\nhipsa so we are very underserved as far\nas mental health providers\nso that's the reason we're trying to\npress with the National Health Service\nCorps and with our state loan repayment\nprogram for Recruitment and Retention of\nthese providers because we are in such a\nneed for health care providers\nthank you\nWalker\nthank you Mr chairman and thank you\ndirector Hamm for all the good work you\ndo in this the real good presentation\nyou've made you touch a lot of areas I\nthink we would all agree that access to\nhealth care is a key determining factor\nin economic development in any part of\nour state\nin addition to the you know the\nwell-being of the of the citizens and\nthe quality of life but\num\nthe economic development if you don't\nhave access to health care it's hard for\nme to see how you're going to be able to\nattract industry I think the number one\nissue driving economic development in my\nmind is quality education system uh I\nthink that's where some areas have a\ncompetitive advantage over others and\nthen I think number two is is health\ncare and they're you know you could\nargue one over the other but uh and and\ntouching on the con issue that's my\nbiggest concern with uh CEO eliminating\ncon I think there's room for\nimprovements and streamlining and and\nmodifications and but these these rural\nhospitals if we were to lose more rural\nhospitals I think we would see a further\ndecline in those areas as far as\npopulation and economic development and\nand that's that's my biggest concern is\nthat we don't miss we don't go too far\nwith that and impact that the J-1 Visa\nwaiver program\nI have had a number of calls over the\nlast really just a couple years about\nPhysicians coming from other countries\nthat can't get licensed\nto practice in Georgia is this a\ncomposite Medical Board issue is this is\nit the do you have any idea why that\nwould be the case if we do have this\nprogram\nI would I would say\num you know would be with the composite\nMedical Board because when we accept the\napplications they have to provide their\nlicense to practice in Georgia I mean\nthat's part of it or either where they\nhave applied for a license\nI just said I've had a number of calls\nabout that and I'll try to dig into that\na little bit further and I was just\ngoing to say not to say it's a problem\nwith the medical board but that would be\na question we would need to pose to them\nand certainly happy to make that\nOutreach and kind of get a little bit of\nclarification on what those requirements\nwould be I'm gonna have that opportunity\nlater and okay I'm sure I've got a study\ncommittee on licensing going on\num but thank you uh what is the average\ndo you or do you know the average amount\nof the rural Hospital stabilization\ngrants\nit didn't look like a ton of money to me\nwhen you divide it by 35 hospitals and\nwe're like a lot of work for not a big\ngirl definitely and as I mentioned in\nthe early I will I will agree it's a lot\nof work but in the early years the\nfunding fluctuated\num it had originally started at 750 per\nhospital\num uh so 750 000 awarded per hospital\nand then we had a couple of years where\nit dipped down to 250 or another year\nwas 300 000 so we recognized when we\ndipped down to those numbers that um\nthey were not able to be as effective uh\nas they were when they were in the\nhigher range so on average I'm not good\nat math but 45 divided by 30 uh six I\nthink hospitals we said\num would be what the average is but\nwe're trying to stay in that sweet bot\nSweet Spot range of about 750 800\n000 now so I would think you would have\nto be there or higher to make it worth\nabsolutely I mean 300 000 for a hospital\nis nothing really\nwe have seen some impressive projects we\nmoney that definitely they are very\nappreciative the hospitals are very\nappreciative of the funding they\nrecognize that there are so many things\nthey would have not been able to do had\nit not been that funding and a lot of it\nis speaks to the employee satisfaction\nabove and beyond just Recruitment and\nRetention bonuses or efforts directly\nrelated to Recruitment and Retention and\nWorkforce but also some of those\nimprovements uh upgraded equipment those\nkind of things that have certainly\nincreased status employee satisfaction\nand have been beneficial hugely\nbeneficial for attracting their\nresidents back into their hospitals for\ntheir care\num you we I keep hearing about A Renewed\ninterest in the nursing field which is\nencouraging a lot of new students\napplying and wanting to get into it uh\ndespite you know the covered situation\nand everything\nbut the the bottleneck seems to be the\nshortage of instructors I hear that over\nand over and over\nwhat can we do to address that\nabsolutely and I am not sure I would be\nthe most appropriate person to address\nthat but it's definitely something that\nwe see what we talk about more with the\nrural hospitals is uh preceptors inside\nthe hospital for the students but the um\nsome of the there are some incentive\nprograms for nursing staff to be\nauxiliary instructors or adjunct\ninstructors for the schools but I'm\nprobably not the best to address that\nparticular question\njust very quickly the the commission\nthat that wrote that report had a pretty\ngood in-depth recommendations for the\nthe\nbarriers for\nEducational Systems so I would urge\ny'all to to look into that that's that's\nkind of out of our Governor's commission\nyeah okay\nI would appreciate that thank you thank\nyou uh just I'm sorry chairman\num\nso aheg I was disappointed I worked with\nuh Miss Juliana on trying to identify\nwhere our nurses are our licensed nurses\nwhere they live\num and I would have thought that was a\nbasic thing we would have had at easy\naccess to and ahec did not have it and\napparently it wasn't a requirement when\nthey renewed their life to got their\nlicense I think we passed legislation to\naddress that is that right\ncharacter but\num I'd like to learn more about ahec and\nwhat they're doing and and they're you\nknow how much worse we how much it costs\nthe state for ahec and and I I would\nhope they would have a maybe some\nsuggestions on these nursing instructors\nand then one real quick on the\npercentage of Health Care graduates uh\n58 your is your statistic I was recently\nat a public university that has a\nmedical school and there for doctors\nthere uh in-state percentage was 40\npercent and they thought that was very\ngood I thought it was not so good\num I just I think we need to figure out\nwhy we are investing the kind of dollars\nin these public institutions for to\ntrain a doctor which is extremely\nexpensive uh and not keeping them in our\nstate so thank you\nthank you\nthank you all for that presentation\nthank you appreciate it\nnext we have Zachary Taylor\nforeign\nand just for reference John I'm going to\nget you to keep the 30 minute timer we\ndidn't do it on the first one or Miss\nBernita will keep that\nI'll try and catch you up on everything\nI'm Dr Zachary Taylor of the District\nHealth director for District Two their\nstate is divided into 18 different uh\nHealth districts regarding Public Health\nI also cover the district just west of\nus west of my district which goes from\nCherokee County up through Whitfield\nCounty\num\ncan you go to the next slide\nokay\nso uh each County in Georgia has a\npublic health program\nand they're really two parts to that\npublic health program the first is the\nhealth department the health department\nobviously provides clinical and\npreventive services and does activities\nrelated to communicable disease control\nand then there's Environmental Health in\neach County also they're responsible for\ninstallation of septic systems\nrestaurant inspections tourist\naccommodations they do activities\nrelated to rabies control\nand to now body art which was uh just\npassed by the legislature so I'm going\nto talk about two types of employees\nthat we have one or public health nurses\nthe other are environmentalists we also\nhave obviously\num\nclerical people we hire LPNs we have\noften in our rural counties we have\naprns that travel to different counties\nto provide services that are beyond the\nscope of care for our Public Health\nnurses\nso our Public Health nurses are are\nunique they're what we call expanded\nrole nurses\na nursing graduate who comes out of\nnursing school or even a nurse who has\nworked in a hospital for several years\nis not ready to be a public health nurse\nbecause of the expanded role that they\nhave which involves essentially\nassessing patients and providing\ntreatment based on protocols that are\ndeveloped and that they have to have\ntraining for so we don't really have a\npublic health nurse until she's been\nwith us for nine months to one year and\nas I said they assess and provide\ntreatment they make referrals they give\nvaccinations and they follow these\nprotocols or they contact me and I give\nthem directions on treatment or\nassessment or the patient or further\nreferral for that patient\nor primaries you know go back\nI'm sorry our primary service Services\ninvolve Women's Health we do a lot of\nactivities related to Women's Health\nthat includes reproductive Health\nServices\nFamily Planning we also provide cancer\nscreening for breast and cervical\ncancers for low-income women\nuh we do communicable disease control as\nI said that's primarily the treatment\nassessment and treatment of sexually\ntransmitted diseases as well as\ntuberculosis we provide immunizations to\nall ages in the population we provide\nservices for children's health and that\ncan range from uh hearing and hearing\nand dental that they require for\nattendance at school\nare scoliosis screening that's required\nfor certain age groups and then some of\nour health departments have additional\nservices but the first four I listed\nwould be the primary Services provided\nin our rural Health departments\nin addition our health departments work\nwith our schools we work with senior\ncenters jails and prisons Social\nServices organizations and drug\ntreatment centers to make sure that the\npersons in those in those institutions\nhave all the services that they need\nthat we can provide for them\nprimarily if you could take what was\nsaid in the last presentation and apply\nit to our our needs which are primarily\nStaffing that's that's the difficulty we\nuh we Face we do have good benefits\nthere are the same benefits state\nemployees and joy that includes medical\ndental vision 13 holidays uh paid annual\nand sick leave and a 401 k match program\nand even a pension if you if you work\nfor us long enough but again as was\nemphasized earlier younger people aren't\nreally concerned with those things so\nattracting and hiring a younger\nWorkforce is uh struggle that we have\nthe other struggle we have is our pay so\nwe start out nurses at 49 000 to 51 000\nwe go up to 63 to 66 000 for nurses who\nhave been with us longer and who have\ncompleted all of the training that's\nrequired to become a public health nurse\nI'll point out that that 66\n000 figure that's generally around what\na hospital would start a new nurse at a\nnew nurse out of\nuh out of nursing school so our pay is\nlower than what nurses can earn in the\npublic sector in the public sector I\nmean the private sector sorry\nnext slide please\nso we have several challenges in hiring\nPublic Health nurses as I mentioned the\nsalary and competition with the private\nsector\nbelieve it or not a lot of nurses and\nyounger people like the flexibility of\nshift work you know I don't understand\nthat particular attraction but\nthey like that flexibility we obviously\nhave set office hours five days a week\nso that's not as attractive to some of\nthem\nwe don't have tuition reimbursement\nprograms specific to Public Health we\ncan in some instances access the hersa\nprograms that were mentioned for tuition\nreimbursement to pay for their schooling\nbut we don't really have a most of our\nnurses that we hire have are not coming\ndirectly from school and that's less of\nan issue for them\nuh since we are talking about rural\ncounties many of our nurses may live in\nanother County than the county that they\nwork in so their commute may be long and\nif they have an opportunity to work\ncloser to home they'll take it we had a\nreal problem when gas prices were so\nmuch higher last year and we lost\nseveral people because of the cost of\ntheir commute\nwe have some part-time workers but they\ndon't receive any benefits\nand we don't have a cola or on an annual\nor routine basis\nbut the legislature has been very\ngenerous lately in providing increases\nin our in our pay scales\nand then while we evaluate all of our\nemployees yearly there's no monetary\nvalue associated with that with their\nevaluation so high scores don't get\nanything extra out of that\nI'm going to jump to the environmental\nhealth which is a totally different\ngroup of employees and these are\nthese are persons that have to have\ncompleted a bachelor's degree from an\naccredited University and they have to\nhave a certain number of semester hours\nrelated to to laboratory and science\num\njust as with our nurses when we hire\nthat person out of college they are not\nready to be an environmentalist they\nhave to they have to be trained and we\nhave to train them to be an\nenvironmentalist so they have to learn\nhow to do they don't teach people how to\ndo on-site sewage Management in schools\nthey have to know about soils so they\nhave to know what this is related to the\nseptic systems how how different soils\npercolate they have to know how to\ninspect a restaurant\nthey have to know how to deal with\nmaking sure animals that are suspected\nof being rabid are\ntreated to be sent to the laboratory\nthat requires that those persons be\nvaccinated against rabies\num they have to know about vector\ncontrol we do some activities related\naround mosquitoes they have to learn how\nto inspect pools and tourist\naccommodations and now they have to know\nhow to deal with the body art they have\nto take the same\ncertification that a body artist that's\na tattoo artist\nyes sorry\nthey have to take this they have to take\nthe same classes at the uh that the body\nartist quote unquote also does they also\nare heavily involved in emergency\nresponse training with what happened\nrecently in south Georgia with the\nhurricane we have teams across the state\nof environmentalists if they're needed\nthey go to that area to help them get\nthe the businesses back online so that\nthey can provide continue to provide\nservices in their community so if the\nelectricity goes off\nFood Service establishment if they don't\nhave backup generators they lose a lot\nof food because of the refrigerate loss\nof refrigeration so they have to go back\nin and make sure they have water\nappropriate Refrigeration things like\nthat so that they can open back up and\ntheir owners can continue to earn income\nand provide the food for their community\nand then\ncustomer service is a big issue with\nthis group of people because\nyou know I'll get into this briefly\nbecause they're also a regulatory group\nso they approve or disapprove someone's\napplication to install a septic system\nobviously they go into restaurants and\ndepending on the grade they give the\nrestaurant is able to open and close\nso no one likes Regulators so they have\nto learn how to deal with people who are\nangry or frustrated with what's going on\nand and how to serve those people in a\nmanner that we should expect the public\nto be served by employees of our\ngovernment\nnext\nso they have the same types of benefits\nas you can see the entry level salary is\neven lower it's about forty two thousand\ndollars for someone coming out of\ncollege I don't know if you have\nchildren family friends who are just\ngraduating from college but most of them\nexpect to make more than forty two\nthousand dollars a year in their first\njob the national average is around forty\nseven thousand dollars we do have a\ncareer ladder it goes from uh\none two three four five again it's based\non their years of experience it's about\na year to go from one level to the next\nlevel\nand also their ability to be certified\nfor a different\num if they complete everything they need\nto know how to do land use or septic\nsystems Food Service\nEtc\nand then in each County we have a eh\nCounty manager which is a little higher\nlevel\nand oftentimes they move on to\nthe district or to the state office\nwhich is a little bit\na better job depending on whether where\nthey live and what their family is doing\nso next slide\nso sort of the same challenges salary is\nthe biggest one I'd say for us\nthese people also work in different\nenvironments\num if you know they're uh when it was 95\n99 degrees out they're out there\nexamining septic systems which is not\nthe most Pleasant thing to do or they're\nin kitchens in other areas which\nare not always Pleasant also and it and\nthen again they do their Regulators in\nthat sense so they often deal with\nunhappy people who are frustrated and\nthey have to tell them that they have to\ndo something additional to be approved\nfor their systems we don't have a\ntuition reimbursement program for them\nand there's no increase in pay so if one\nof our environmentalists goes back to\nschool gets a master's degree there's no\nincrease in Pay associated with that\nwe also don't have benefits for\npart-time positions in the same as\nbefore there's no Cola on an annual\nbasis and no monetary value attached to\ntheir yearly evaluation\nso I do appreciate the the opportunity\nto speak to you and I I'll be glad to\nanswer any of your questions\nthank you for your presentation my\nquestion and I may have just missed this\nis there any contribution from the\ncounties\ntowards the uh salaries and so on yeah I\nmentioned I I failed to mention that so\nthe way our public health programs are\nfunding there really are\num three sources of funding first they\nget a grant aid from the state so that\nincludes both State dollars or federal\ndollars that are passed through the\nState Department of Public Health\nuh they can also apply directly for some\nsome grants which increase\nthe funding and then the county provides\nthe counties required by law to to\nprovide uh funding to the health\ndepartment now what they're required to\nprovide is a small amount almost all of\nour counties provide more than that\namount for for the public health program\nand then finally there are fees and\ncharges for services so if someone comes\nin and applies for a permit for a septic\nsystem there's a fee for that if someone\ncomes to our health department to\nreceive Services\nwe charge\ntheir insurance or if they don't have\ninsurance we have a sliding fee scale\nbut I will say no one's turned away\nbecause they can't pay and we don't have\na collection agency so if they don't pay\nwe're not going to go after them for\nthat for that charge\none of the questions that I had is you\nyou brought up\num\nnurses that get a master's degree there\nis no increase in pay for them is that\nbecause we don't have our the positions\nthat they're in is a master's degree not\nneeded or do we not have those or could\nyou could you explain that a little bit\nmore as to why that is the when I\nmentioned that that was referring to our\nenvironmentalist okay so not our nurses\nso most of our nurses we don't really\nhave any let's say they go and get a\nmasters of Public Health\nwe might consider that in promoting them\nto the next is if they're a phn3 I mean\ntwo they might be promoted to a phn3 but\nthere's not a there's not a really a big\nladder\nfor increases just based on that\neducational component now if they become\nif they get a master's in nursing that\nallows them to be an advanced practice\nnurse then obviously that's a different\nsalary scale than just a regular RM but\nas I said we don't really have\nadvanced practice nurses assigned to\nindividual rural Health departments we\nhave several in our larger Metropolitan\nHealth departments\num but we do have advanced practice\nnurses that travel to the different\nHealth departments so that they can\nprovide some of our reproductive Health\nServices thank you\nSenator Jackson\nthank you Mr chairman thank you for your\npresentation\num can you tell us what is this is there\na shortage um how many counties are\nmissing nurses or broadly speaking do\nyou know kind of where we are on on this\nissue\nso right now so for instance for our\ndistrict then just talking about our\nrural counties we have about four open\npositions\nin say a county like Habersham we have\nthree nurses Public Health nurses in\nHabersham some of our smaller counties\nwe may only have two Public Health\nnurses we try to have more than one\nobviously because if they're sick or if\nthey're on vacation then there's no\ncoverage at all\nbut it's a constant churn it's not just\nthose particular openings we next week\nwe may have more in fact I know we just\nhad a uh resignation in Raven County so\nwe'll be that'll add to the number that\nwe have\nand the problem in our rural counties is\ndifferent than the problem in our\nMetropolitan counties there's if we go\nto Hall County we always have four or\nfive openings in Hall County but they're\ncom we're competing against a very large\nhospital system\n[Laughter]\nso so so there's a different challenge\nthere most of our nurses in our rural\ncounties they they live in those\ncounties are in rural counties nearby\nthey they enjoy their work they want to\nbe part of their community so we\nactually retain nurses in our rural\nCounty slightly better than we do in our\nlarger\nguys\nyes\nany more questions\nthank you for your presentation thank\nyou today Dr Taylor I really appreciate\nit\nall right next we have uh Liz Atkins\nexecutive director of Georgia trauma\nCommission\nforeign\ngood morning good morning and thank you\nso much uh Senator Hatchet for the\ninvite to talk about this and as I\nlooked at the resolution that created\nthe study committee and saw that you\nwere about Surgical and surgical\nsubspecialties trauma is a surgical\ndisease and so this is very germane to\nto what we do so we are grateful for the\nopportunity to have a few moments of\nyour time and I bring you greetings from\nour chairman who's in Australia right\nnow and is texting me with beautiful\npictures at 4am\nso that's been fun\num so and you can\nadvance advance advance we'll get all\nthe bullet points up there there we go\nso I just wanted to start out with\ngiving you all a little bit more reason\nfor why you're here and why the work\nthat you're doing as this committee is\nso important\nand a a well-organized trauma system\nsaves lives it's very well documented\nand this is the story of an 18 year old\nthis happened not very far from where\nwe're sitting\nand this story plays out all over rural\nGeorgia every day\nbut this is an 18 year old I know\nsometimes in the news we hear a lot\nabout firearm injuries and those things\ntend to attract a lot of attention but\nthis is really the nuts and bolts of a\nlot of what we see but this was um\na young man just weeks away from his\nhigh school graduation and he was out on\na motorcycle\nand unfortunately\ncame around a wet corner and lost it a\nlittle bit there and slid out and the\nvehicle you can actually see on the\nbottom\nleft there or sort of in the middle that\ntruck was equipped with front and rear\ncameras and that is the view right\nbefore that young boy is hit by that\ntruck and he couldn't do anything to\navoid him because the bike was still\nsliding the top picture is actually\nafter the truck hit him the boy is still\nin the road and you can see what's\nheaded right towards him is a big tanker\nso um really devastating\num the when EMS responded on scene they\nwere actually closer to a non-trauma\ncenter but they knew based on his\ninjuries he was still conscious and\nalert thankfully his he hadn't been head\ninjured they knew he needed to get to a\nTrauma Center so they took him to what\nwas a level two at that time it's now a\nlevel one and part of the Northeast\nGeorgia Health Care system which we are\nat today\num and that young man was in the\noperating room within 32 minutes of\narrival he had very complex\nintra-abdominal and Orthopedic injuries\nhe had multiple surgeries over the next\ncouple months and even though that was\nright before his high school graduation\nyou see him there months later not only\ndid he survive but he's under the Arches\nat his orientation to his freshman year\nso these are the things that we like to\ncelebrate this is the reason you are all\nhere and we thank you for for bringing\nthis attention forward so next slide\nso I have to give you a little bit of an\noverview just so you can kind of for\ncontext purposes and next slide\nso what's the difference right why\nwhat's the difference between for\nexample a center that we're sitting in\nright now and a trauma center and really\nthe Trauma Centers deal with most of the\nthe most severe injuries\nthey are equipped to stabilize and\ntransfer in in the more rural Trauma\nCenters such as the level three and\nlevel four and we'll go over that in a\nsecond and then emergency departments\nmore commonly treat\nuh you know less serious broken uh\nbroken bones maybe loss of consciousness\nheart attack stroke we hear lots about\nheart attack and stroke uh you know\ngastrointestinal illness the shortness\nof breath sort of the medical things\nthat you think of in next line\nso in Georgia similar to what the\nnational Norms are we have four levels\nof Trauma Center\nlevel one centers provide Total Care and\nthat's really from prevention through\nRehabilitation and these are what we\nthink of you think of an Atlanta Grady\nhospital now as I mentioned Northeast\nGeorgia hospital we have five level ones\nin Georgia they have teaching programs\nand they teach medical residents\nsurgical residents and they are really\ndoing the research that drives trauma\ncare and how we how we manage trauma\npatients the level two trauma centers\nare very clinically similar to level one\ncenters however they most commonly do\nnot have the teaching component\nand they typically treat both adults and\nchildren we have two level two pediatric\nTrauma Centers one is in Augusta one is\nin Atlanta Scottish Rite\nand we have one level one Pediatric\nCenter at Eggleston level three Trauma\nCenters are smaller than a level one or\nlevel two\nbut they can still provide prompt\nsurgical intervention and some\nsub-specialty care so it's important for\nyou to remember one's twos and threes\nare surgically driven\nnow when we get down to the level fours\nwhich you commonly see in the rural\nareas\nand underserved areas they really are\nmore emergency medicine driven so that's\nwhy the emergency medicine specialty is\nreally critical in these areas\nand most of these patients that arrive\nto level four Trauma Centers will be\ntheir primary goals to begin rapid\nresuscitation we'll talk about some of\nthe challenges this is associated with\nthat and then transfer to higher level\nof care so next slide please\nso who writes the rules for all of these\ndifferent levels and we'll you'll hear\nme mention this again but the American\nCollege of Surgeons that little gray\nbook that you see there on the left were\nsuffering through a a transition now\nthese are the new so-called criteria\nthat were just released and go into\neffect in fact this month\nso\num unfortunately the American College of\nSurgeons left out level four criteria in\nthis iteration of their book they\nrecognized that that was a major uh\nshortfall so they were going back to the\ndrawing board thankfully they Dr\nKirkpatrick is very familiar with this\nas an orthopedic surgeon you know this\nbetter than anyone\num they actually developed a rural\ncommittee that's actually comprised of\nrural trauma surgeons instead of being\nUrban surgeons who are kind of dictating\nwhat's happening in the rural\nenvironment so this is very encouraging\nto see so we will see currently we're\nusing the old guidelines right now\nthat's what the college has recommended\nbut they are developing new guidelines\nso we look forward to that as well sorry\nif you could back up one minute on the\nright we'll talk about this in a little\nbit too\num\nthe American College of Surgeons also\nhas\nstandards around what optimal trauma\nsystems look like and that's mostly what\nthe Georgia trauma commission is really\ninvolved in the next slide\nso what's a Trauma Center you see there\nin the in the middle sort of all the\ndifferent roles and as you've heard the\npresenters before me\ntalk about these different positions and\nhow hard they are to fill and the\nrecruitment issues and the whole reason\nwhy this study committee was assembled\nright if we don't have people to fill\nthose positions we don't have trauma\nteams so we most commonly uh if you can\nlook at that NASCAR picture on the\nbottom I think everybody understands how\nquick that team they don't even talk to\neach other right they just they know\nwhat they're they're going to do you can\nsee them ready before the car even pulls\nin and that's what we we like to think\nabout the well-functioning trauma team\nfunctions a lot like a NASCAR pit crew a\nnext slide please\nso just a brief background on our trauma\nsystem so we've been about 41 years in\nthe making we always say but who's\ncounting we keep we keep chipping away\nat it right it's never perfect\num our first Trauma Center was\ndesignated about 42 years ago and again\nwe've made significant progress but when\nwe talk about some of the challenges in\nthe rural trauma care environment we're\nnot we're not quite where we need to be\nyet and next slide\nso\nnot unlike we're all here right now the\nGeorgia trauma commission was created\nout of a study a senate study committee\nuh sorry both House and Senate study\ncommittee which was created during the\n2006 legislative session it was five\nmembers on the house side and five\nmembers on the Senate side and they\nheard testimony from all over the state\nfrom State and National trauma experts\nthere were five Regional public meetings\nthe next slide\nand you can keep uh yeah there you go\nthanks and these were some of the key\nfindings so our death rate at that time\nwas 20 percent worse than the national\naverage I have some I have some slides\non this that'll show you where we are\nnow only 30 percent of traumatic\ninjuries were actually treated as\ndesignated Trauma Centers it's not\nuncommon that injuries are treated at\nnon-trauma centers but we want to make\nsure that the most critical patients are\ngoing to Trauma Centers and we have some\ninformation to share with you on that\ntoo traumatic death rates in rural\nGeorgia were much higher than urban\nareas and annually at the time Georgia's\ntrauma care providers and this is the\nhospitals the surgeons and EMS we're\ndelivering about 250 million dollars in\nuncompensated trauma care so people were\nfleeing the system there was really no\nincentive to participate in the trauma\nsystem next time\nso this shows you again where we were\nright before this Senate study committee\nand if I can show you if you can see\nwhere um\nI-75 is sort of the red line\nthat goes down through the middle of the\nstate and you can see where you get\num somewhere around Macon where we start\nkind of outlining the counties that\nTraverse I-75\nand a number of those counties are quite\na distance from a Trauma Center or were\nquite a distance from a Trauma Center at\nthat time and at that time this was Data\ncompiled by Dr Pat O'Neill who many of\nyou may know who served for a while at\nthe state and the death rate in these\nareas was almost twice what the death\nrate was for the for the entire state\nso unfortunately I-75 became known as\nThe Carter of death and you know many\npeople travel through I-75 even coming\nthrough other states to go through\nGeorgia\nand so without funding retention was a\nproblem so we already had an issue where\nwe didn't have enough and then people\nwere leaving next slide please\nso this at our first ACS visit in a\nsystem consult visit in 09 became coined\nas the islands of excellence in a sea of\nchaos right we had centers who were\nholding on they were trying to do\neverything they could to deliver really\ngood patient care but there just was no\ngood coordination between them and next\nslide\nso this led to the formation of the\nGeorgia trauma commission so this was\nsb60 in the 07 legislative session later\nbecoming known as official Georgia Code\n31-11 100 to 103 which established a\nnine-member Georgia trauma Care Network\nCommission\nuh right now we're administratively\nattached to Department of Public Health\nthere's three other full-time folks plus\nmyself so we're a very small But Mighty\nteam of four and our annual budget is\nabout about 23 to 21 million that\nprimarily comes from the super speeder\nfunding as well as a small portion of\nthe fireworks excise tax\num through that it sounds like a lot of\nmoney but when you got 35 Trauma Centers\nand I'm proud to say that every single\nTrauma Center in Georgia right now is\nfunded if you're designated unless you\ncame in after the start of the fiscal\nyear or after we submitted our budget\nwhich I think is just one Center but\nwe'll add them next year everybody is\nfunded in addition we do funding for EMS\nand that is legislatively mandated for\ncenters and EMS where we do a portion of\nReadiness and uncompensated care\nand then we have a number of initiatives\nto support trauma system development and\nso next slide\nand so this kind of shows you where we\nare now in terms of the Distribution on\nthe right and I do have uh the map on\nthe left kind of depicts where the EMS\nregions are so um I think neatest map\nshowed this really well too if you look\nat regions eight and nine and you\nremember her map we have a lot of rural\na ground to cover down there and\nparticularly in Region 8 and South and\nregion seven we have a lot of areas\nwhere we don't even have any hospitals\nso EMS transport times are very\nprotracted in those areas so patients\nMay travel a long distance in those\nareas to get to a Trauma Center\nnext slide please\nand so just to highlight some of our\nrural care initiatives and programs the\nnext slide\nprobably the biggest thing that we were\nable to accomplish this year and and it\ntook us at least a year in planning is\nthat we had remember I showed you the\nslide where the American College of\nSurgeons is the one that sort of writes\nthe rules for Trauma Centers as well as\nessential elements for trauma systems we\nhad an American College of Surgeons\ntrauma system consult and we added on we\nasked them we were the first state to\never do this and they're going to use us\nas a template moving forward we ask them\nto come look at our world trauma system\nwe said hey we've got issues here we\ndon't really know how to deal with them\ncan you guys send us some rural experts\nand that's what they did they sent us a\nteam of seven folks from across the\ncountry primarily rural a couple folks\nthat were from larger City areas\nand um we had about 130 140 people in\nattendance it was amazing just like this\nit would be great if we could meet more\noften to kind of brainstorm about some\nof these issues\nand so that was early this year just\nbefore the or right on the uh beginning\nof the legislative session and next\nslide\nso I've given you the link for the full\nreport I think the full report has a\nvery good\num\noverview executive summary as well as\nthe full rural focused piece and I think\nit's very worthwhile looking at\nsystem-wide there were 14 priority\nrecommendations 89 total overall\nrecommendations from the rural Focus\nthere were eight priority\nrecommendations in 29 overall rural\nrecommendations we have the exit summary\nthat was videotaped because we did it by\nZoom the team was there for a full five\ndays they had three stakeholder visits\nacross the country but they stayed\nsequestered so they could actually do\nour report and then give us a really\nnice meaningful exit summary on the last\nday and next slide please\nso I'm just going to hit the highlights\nof what the priority rural\nrecommendations are because it's very\ngermane to the work that you're doing\nhere and the first one was to perform a\ncomprehensive resource needs assessment\nincluding funding for the rural trauma\nsystem\nemphasizing obviously the rural aspect\nof EMS and the trauma hospitals and then\na rural capacity needs assessment to\nidentify gaps which included again EMS\nthe trauma hospitals and transfer\ncapabilities because just because the\npatients make it to the hospital now we\nhave the conundrum of how do we get them\nfrom the world Trauma Center to the\ntertiary Care Center when they need to\nbecause our EMS colleagues are certainly\nnot flush with staff and then exactly\nwhat you're here for Recruitment and\nRetention primarily focusing on trauma\nproviders nursing and EMS and next slide\nplease\nso and then you can hit it again so one\nof the things we wanted to understand\nour group has published quite a bit on a\nnumber of things not only access but\nwhat does it cost and we've published\ntwice on the level one and level two\ncost that's been out there for a while\nthat's pretty well known but we never\nhad a sight line into what does it cost\nto run a level three or a level four\nTrauma Center so this was the first data\nin the country of its kind this went\ncrazy on social media when Dr Ashley\npresented this at the Double AST\nAmerican Association for the surgery of\ntrauma because everybody wanted to know\nhow much it cost so we could actually\nput a number on it for the first time\nso the average cost for a level three\nTrauma Center this is Readiness this is\nkind of what it costs to keep the lights\non before the first patient ever comes\nthrough the door was about 1.7 million\nand the highest cost not inconsistent\nwith what you've heard already is the\nclinical medical staff right because\neverybody gets call pay now nobody's\neven going to come to the table to talk\nto you unless you have some sort of\nmechanism to provide them with call pay\nso if we're on call if I have an\northopedic surgeon and I say you need to\nbe at the hospital within 30 minutes if\nwe call you we're gonna he's gonna want\ncall pay or she\nand then level four Trauma Centers\nthat eighty one thousand dollars is\nextremely conservative we know it's\nhigher than that we just could not get\nthe information out of them this was\nreally hard to get out of them we do\nwant to repeat this because we think\nwe've figured out some ways to help them\nkind of quantify the cost of that\nemergency medicine coverage because\nthat's primarily what they're having to\ncover\num and and they reported their highest\ncost category was the administrative\ncost category so\nnext slide\nprimarily I think because they couldn't\nquantify that medical staff coverage\nfrom New York we think we have a formula\nto help them help them with that next\ntime\nso what are we doing about some of these\nthings we're really proud we couldn't do\nthe work that we do with a staff of four\nwithout partnering with many of the\npeople even in this room and one of the\nfolks that we partner with is a Georgia\nEmergency Medical Services Association\nthey do a lot of\nEducation professional and initial\nlicensure education so EMT EMR classes\nas well as continuing education classes\nlast year they delivered over 189 000\ncontact hours in education which is a\nfeat among itself but knowing the gaps\nthat we have in Recruitment and\nRetention they were also funded to do a\npublic service announcement which should\nbe airing very shortly we just got the\nfinal approval on that so\nagain I think you've already heard some\nof the challenges with Recruitment and\nRetention this is a little bit of a\ndifferent era when I you know looked at\nthat and that's the sort of the opening\nuh\nseen on the PSA is you know what do you\nwant to do with your life you want to\nmake a difference well we have to talk\nabout you know pay and flexible\nscheduling and things like that it's\njust not enough to say I really want to\nhelp people anymore we really need to\nmake it a little bit more attractive\num and I think that Recruitment and\nRetention for EMS has been a perennial\nchallenge right you've already heard\nabout environmental health I mean\nthere are not many people who want to\nlike lay on their stomach in a ditch and\ntry to intubate someone on the side of\nthe road and in my previous life I was a\nflight nurse so I've experienced some of\nthat myself and it's just not it's just\nhard and you're not gonna you're not\ngonna keep them in the field for long\nI'm also married into EMS so I feel like\nI live eat sleep and drink recruitment\nchallenges and Health Care challenges so\nnext slide please\nand then the next priority\nrecommendation was to ensure involvement\nand participation of the rural trauma\nhospitals and EMS in an inclusive\nStatewide trauma system plan\nI have to say we had our colleagues at\ndph years ago\nwe had a beautiful trauma system plan\nbut nobody knew where it was\nand nobody really we didn't really look\nat it we didn't regularly visit it and\nsay are we doing these things that we\nsay are optimal things\nso we need more than to just check a box\nwe need to actually write the plan the\nway that and have metrics that we go\nback and revisit it and when we talk\nabout an inclusive\nStatewide system you know we we tend to\nfocus on those real critical injuries\nbut a lot of these rural hospitals\nwhat's going to keep them alive are some\nof those minor injuries that we\nshouldn't necessarily bypass the center\nto go to a higher level of care because\nthose injuries can be managed at that\nfacility and it's actually good business\nfor them to keep those patients where\nthey need to be and not far away from\ntheir loved ones so next slide\nand then the next two recommendations\nstandardized trauma care in rural\nGeorgia utilizing educational programs\nand increase rural emergency medicine\nproviders and resources to provide\ncapability to manage dramatically\ninjured patients\none of the biggest educational programs\nout there for um\ntrauma care\nfor providers is advanced Trauma Life\nSupport very hard to take that course on\nthe road Senator Patrick you know about\nthis this course was actually by an\northopedic surgeon who was in a horrible\naccident\nand you know found that his experience\nwas that people in rural areas don't\nunderstand how to save lives trauma care\nis different than Cardiac Care it's\ndifferent than stroke care and sadly\nit's not very cookbook because traumatic\ninjuries don't follow any specific path\nso next slide please\nso one of the things we like to do at\nthe commission is when we can't figure\nsomething out we phone a friend so we\nlooked at some other states who had\nsimilar Geographic distributions such as\nours and Pockets where there were maybe\nno rural Trauma Centers and how do you\ntap into that how do you make sure it's\nbad enough these people can't keep the\nlights on and take care of the patients\nthey have how do we tell them oh by the\nway you also have to evaluate the care\nyou're providing you have to figure out\nwhere the opportunities are so we look\nto Pennsylvania we actually looked at\nPennsylvania and Texas but Pennsylvania\nwas actually able to do this for us so\nthey sent a team they have a very\nstructured program for level four\ncenters and they have requirements that\nare above and beyond what the American\ncollege sets out so they came and they\nvisited five of our level four centers\nthey sent two teams of three reviewers\neach\nand the best part was they had emergency\nmedicine physicians so these weren't\nUrban surgeons coming in telling the\nrural providers how to do it these folks\nhad experience in the rural areas\nthemselves\nso the reason we did this we wanted them\nto evaluate what our level four\nReadiness to take care of injured\npatients really you know tell us the\ndown and dirty we want to know all of it\nand then we wanted them to share we know\nyou guys have some really high\nfunctioning level for us could you share\nthose best practices and then we wanted\nthem to come to the commission meeting\nand present their aggregate findings and\nnext slide please\nsome of these I'm honestly were a little\nbit hard to hear\nnot unlike what you've heard earlier the\ncommunity commitment was incredible\nthese folks are very engaged with what\nthey do in their communities and they\nwant to do a good job they simply don't\nhave the resources to do it and despite\ntheir limited resources many of them\nwere actively engaged in injury\nprevention and Outreach which was some\nof the things we have we struggled with\nthe level ones and the level twos who\nare much better resourced many of them\nhad very adequate facilities lovely\nfacilities as a matter of fact they had\ngreat access to equipment and strong\nHospital leadership support they wanted\nto do the right thing unfortunately the\ntrauma program managers might have also\nbeen the emergency department manager\nand the stroke coordinator and the\nquality improvement person and you know\nwhatever else they were wearing too many\nhats to be able to do the role that they\nneeded to do and the same thing with the\nmedical director\num so really just a lack of time and\nreally financial support for education\nso we heard this loud and clear at the\ncommission level and in fact we've\ndoubled the amount of money Readiness\nfunds that it's still not enough and we\nknow we need to measure it as I\nmentioned\num we also didn't really have one things\nthat Pennsylvania does really well is\nthey have a really good formalized\nmentorship program so they compare some\nof the rural centers up with some other\ncolleagues at the level ones and twos\nand provide that support and that helps\neven with the patient throughput and\ntransfer process right if you know the\nother person that you're speaking to on\nthe other side of the phone it makes it\nmuch better\num and then nobody and I mean almost\nnobody had a standardized or structured\nprocess Improvement plan they just don't\nhave time to look into the care it's\nhard right next slide\nand so this was sort of our own homemade\ncourse if you will that we're really\nproud of one of our commission members\nCourtney to williger led the way and if\nyou want to talk about engagement here\nit is right here\num and that the bigger picture there on\nthe left Alicia register you probably\ncan't see it there is about nine and a\nhalf months pregnant I think she\ndelivered the week after that picture\nwas taken but that was our inaugural\nMarch pause course now March pause is a\nmilitary mnemonic stands for massive\nHemorrhage Airway respiration\ncirculation head injury hypothermia pain\nantibiotics wounds and splinting and\nit's basically a down and dirty here's\nwhat we do when the patient arrives\nhere's the things we have to do we we\ninitially called it five things to save\na life and that wasn't sexy enough I\nguess so we decided we'd go with March\npause since that was the mnemonic that\nwe were teaching because as you know\nsenator they don't have time to sit for\na two-day TLS class right so we got to\nget in in there for two to four hours\nand and just come back year after year\nso this is kind of how this was designed\nand this was our Pilot Course which\nhappened just a couple months ago at the\nState Office of rural health so we're so\nhappy to partner with our colleagues I\nthink the Partnerships in Georgia are\nworking that's that's something loud and\nclear to hear today and then on the top\nright that's Greg Patterson he's the\ntrauma surgeon and medical director at\nArchibald who's one of our level three\nuh Trauma Centers down there on the\nborder in Thomasville and then according\nto villager down the bottom and next\nslide\nso two more of the rural Focus priority\nrecommendations improve scene response\nTimes by bolstering existing Mutual Aid\nagreements and addressing Staffing\nshortages so here we go again right\nyou're seeing I'm certainly adding fuel\nto your fire from this ACS report\nbut I think the scene time piece is not\nnecessarily when we're talking about\nwhat time EMS gets the call to what time\nthey arrive on scene but again what we\nfound that most of our challenge is\ngetting the patients out of the rural\nhospital to the um to the level one and\nlevel two care environment and then\ndeveloping a process this is something\nwe're really excited to start looking at\nnow\num develop a process for what what's\nknown as rescue stops and accelerated\ntransfer so what we mean by rescue stops\nand are we're working with the folks our\nneighbors in Alabama who do this really\nwell where\num instead of EMS coming bringing you\nsimilar to the scenario that I started\nwith\nthat patient to a rural hospital and\nthen okay we leave call us when you need\nus to transfer no they stay there with\nthe patient the patient has Auto\nAcceptance to a higher level of care the\npatient stabilized starting blood fluids\nwhatever and then we're on we're on the\nroad We're Not Gonna because then by the\ntime I leave\nI gotta come yeah exactly exactly and we\nmay be on another call some of the\ncontracts require that a 9-1-1 ambulance\nalways stay available so they can't do\nan inner facility so this really helps\nput the patient at the center next slide\nplease\nand then next recommendation provide\neducation and collaboration for Rural\nfacilities to achieve proficiency\nregarding data entry and validity again\nthis becomes so low on the priority list\nwhen you're just trying to take care of\npatients every day right they don't have\nthe expertise to do this\nand then provide rural trauma program\nmanagers process Improvement training\nalong with mentorship and support from\nother facilities and next slide\nso we have one of our programs within\nthe Georgia trauma commission is what we\ncall a Georgia quality improvement\nprogram or gquip as we refer to it\nand so that group consists of the trauma\nprogram managers and the trauma medical\ndirectors from all of the Trauma Centers\nacross the state they meet in person\ntwice annually\nwe just in reinstituted what we're\ncalling the closed peer review meetings\nand this was this was almost like an act\nof God to sort of get this done we had\nto work with the AG's office to get a\nspecial attorney who specializes in peer\nreview which I know you're familiar with\nas well\nto write a resolution to get us to be\nable to do this and so what this does\nfor the rural centers where they might\nnot have another physician who can\nreview care and say Hey you know did we\ndo the best we could what opportunities\nexist here this gives them the benefit\nof having the 34 other centers in the\nstate be able to say hey let's take a\nlook at this and I got to admit we were\nwe were a little nervous when we did\nthis because we weren't sure how this\nwould be received but um it was amazing\nthere was so much great discussion we\nhad really three really good media cases\nthat we talked about here and I was\nwriting notes like crazy on some of the\nopportunities that we at the commission\ncould potentially fund and some of it is\nthat I didn't realize that you know we\npreach that we want them to initiate\nresuscitation and do it correctly\nhowever it is cost prohibitive for\nSenate for Rural centers to get\nplatelets because they're so expensive\nthey don't use them they're throwing\nthem away\nso we're now looking at other states\nthat have programs where they can rotate\nblood supplies so that maybe we can um\nyou know and maybe we can get more blood\nthere's actually up in this area our\ncolleagues at Northeast Georgia have led\na pre-hospital blood actually plasma\nprogram and it would be great to to do\nsomething like that throughout the state\num yes sir\nthat's and I want the community to have\ntime to ask questions so does anybody\nhave any questions right now\nthank you you're definitely preaching to\nthe choir here because this is I live\neat breathe and sleep this stuff too I'm\nmarried to an ER doc so that makes it\neven worse I I have to give a shout out\nto former Center Cecil Staton who really\nstarted this ball rolling based on a\npersonal trauma experience that he had\nand the concept and the goal was the\ngolden hour of trauma to have everybody\nbe within an hour of a Trauma Center\nbecause that can determine living or\ndying and so I congratulate you in what\nyou've done so far it sounds like you've\ngot a lot of really exciting things\ngoing on I'm particularly interested in\nthe pause program that just seems like a\ngreat\num stop gap for hospitals that don't\nhave the resources and you talked about\nmentorship so I'm hoping that you guys\nhave great Partnerships with the various\nHospital associations the GHA and the\ngaca and whoever else there is to work\nwith because they really are at the\nGrassroots in terms of getting the word\nout so my question is is that how you're\noperating is that yes communicating so\nit's almost like you teamed me up for\nthat question because we just\nparticipated with gha's rural committee\nthey invited us to come at their meeting\nin Saint Simons to talk with that group\nabout what um similar to what Nita\nshowed you know the feedback and we said\nlike we need to hear it unfiltered you\nknow tell us what it is you need to do\nand how can we help you we know not\nevery Center is going to be a trauma\ncenter but how do we how do we get you\nthe things you need to take care of in\nyour patients how can we have this\ninclusive system so yes we're partnered\nwith the right I think we're we could\nalways have more Partnerships but I\nthink we have the right people at the\ntable\nCenter Jackson\nthank you so much for the work that you\ndo um so full disclosure I worked as an\nEMT for a very brief period of time\nbecause it's stressful\nand I'd rather care for Souls than\nbodies but nonetheless I I am curious\nare there I mean we we know we have ENT\nshortage across the state do you know do\nwe have good recruitment mechanisms in\nthe high schools to move young people\ninto that field and then thinking\nspecifically about rural needs are our\nEMTs being trained at a higher level do\nthey have more equipment given the long\ndistance I mean you know I worked in\nDekalb it's five minutes to the hospital\nright um but I would I would need a lot\nmore equipment I feel like if I'm in a\n30 minute or an hour long Transportation\nsituation so yeah is there is there\nadditional training are they having\nbetter equipment what's happening there\nand then do we have some good programs\nfor recruitment at the high school\nlevels in our rural areas to train up\nEMTs excellent questions and uh I think\nyou have a speaker later today Chad\nBlack from gemsa who is probably going\nto address some of those things one of\nthe things I did want to bring up though\nis um at the opening session at the last\nlegislative session\nI was so impressed by the work of gdac\nand the healthcare Workforce dashboards\nthat they developed but I was really\ndisappointed to not see pre-hospital on\nthere so I just checked last night in\npreparation for this presentation\nbecause\nthe dph office of EMS and Trauma is\nworking with gdac to get EMS data up on\nthat dashboard because one of the things\nthat they think they might be able to do\nwe know we lose a lot of EMS Personnel\nnot necessarily to the Georgia General\nAssembly like we do but um but to\nnursing because they can get paid for\nyou know more money right\nso\nwe think that between the nursing\ndatabase there might be a way to look at\nwhat is the migration path out of EMS to\nnursing so we can figure out you know\nthat can help inform some of your\nSolutions potentially but I do think\nyou'll hear from Chad later today on\nsome of the recruitment strategies\nbecause it is it is important but to the\ntransportation piece that is so critical\nbecause yes they will spend a lot longer\nin ambulances one of the major\nchallenges is getting some of the\nclinical experience because you know\nthere's only so many\nclinical sites that you can get\nexperiences you know one of the\nlife-saving things that pre-hospital\nfolks can do is intubate someone provide\nyou know and take over mechanical\nrespiration but\num if there's no sites for them to be\nable to do that and then and the\nopportunity doesn't present itself but a\ncouple times a year how proficient can\nyou really be at that I'm going to put\nyou on the spot a little bit\num and it was\nwhen you're the math with the Trauma\nCenters and where they're located in the\nstate and then we obviously went into\nthe the EMS piece of this in your\nopinion do we need to focus resources\nmore on EMS and quicker Transportation\nor do we need to focus on putting Trauma\nCenters in new locations\nI would say we do have a Trauma Center\nrecruitment opportunity but I think we\nneed to figure out\nhow to get the patients where they need\nto go in the most rapid manner I I was\nsurprised in preparation for that ACS\nsystem consult that we had one of the\nthings we had to do is inventory where\nthe air service providers reside and I\nwas shocked to know that we have 29 air\nbases throughout Georgia and South\nGeorgia has a very good presence of air\nMedical Transport somehow and I know\nbecause I was in the business for\nseveral years\nand even sitting in my helicopter in\nAtlanta at Children's Healthcare of\nAtlanta you know the pilots would say\nwell I can get you down there to the\nsick kid but I can't get you back\nbecause we have weather coming in\nthere's foggy conditions down there\nthere's all kinds of phenomena on white\ncan't fly in south Georgia why can't we\nleverage some of those air bases I've\nhad conversations with them they're\ninterested in this they just don't we\nhave to have the right conversations and\nfigure out how we do this or even just\ntry a pilot that's one of the things\nthat we talked about let's\nmaybe pilot it maybe it's you know it\ncan be successful or how do we deploy\nagain from the big academic centers\ncould we send somebody out to backfill\nyour Zone if you can't leave your county\nuncovered you know many of these\ncounties the sickest patient is probably\nthe one in the ER not the call that you\nwon't have for the next 48 hours right\nfor your excellent presentation\nI know there's more to share at the time\nallowed uh and look forward to\nwe're very fortunate to have you in that\nposition in my opinion and it's just\nbeen excellent\num number one and this is right on\nfollowing your your question what about\ninvesting in more Medevac helicopters\nwould that be a good thing to do with\nsome Surplus State funds\nI think the air medical community would\nlove to hear you say that but I'm not\nsure that more is always better as you\nguys are probably hearing from the\ndiscussion here sometimes there's no\namount of money you can throw at\nsomething that's going to fix the\nproblem because again sometimes in the\nair in the areas where we need them the\nmost they simply can't fly I think what\nwe need is the expertise of the people\nwho are on them to somehow you know\ndeploy them to the areas where they're\nneeded to where they may be able to\ntransport them by truck and they don't\ncan't necessarily you know when I was\ngrounded for weather I got on a truck\nand we would drive wherever we needed to\ndrive to get to get this\num\nI'm under the impression and clear this\nup for me that we are woefully\nshort of Trauma Centers compared to our\nadjoining States I heard haven't fact\nchecked it that the City of Charleston\nhas four\nlevel one Trauma Centers\nand you may or may not know that but I I\nthere are dozens more Trauma Centers in\nother states that are similarly\npopulated can you go\num\nback up I just think we need to be\nreally in the real world on this back\nagain\nI'm back before so you know I put this\nhere because yeah that's my district\nthis made you know obviously this made\nheadlines nationally really yeah you\nknow and it underscored what a scarce\nresource it is but if you go to the next\nslide we've had centers leaving the\nsystem for a long time now when Dr\nAshley and I were asked you know to\ncomment on the closure of Atlanta\nMedical Center\nit tended to be more\nare thought of as more of an\natlanta-centric event but what people\ndidn't understand right was that that\ncreated a backlog of patients who were\nwaiting to get out of their Rural Center\nand get to definitive care right because\ndefinitive care centers are so crowded\nright now so really definitive Care\nCenters need to be at the table for some\nof the discussions because if the\npatients can't get out again this is\nwhere the rural Health\nProviders you know I mean what a\ndaunting task to to have you know a\npatient you can't care for so we are\naren't we relatively population and\ngeography how do we compare with our\nsouthern states around us yeah it's it's\na great question even some states have\nadded level five trauma right and so\nwhat's the answer I'm not sure I because\nwe are growing we have designated in the\npast couple years more centers than we\never have and we have at least a half a\ndozen in\nprocess right now so we're really\nencouraged by that the other piece is I\nthink we have to balance over\nproliferation and make sure that again\nwe're delivering that that high quality\ncare so I think we're positioned well\nfor but could you get the numbers for us\nthe states around us because I think we\nneed to take a look at some Stark\nrealities about what we're we've been\nhammering on this trauma system and you\nbrought a new whole level of uh put the\nspotlight on these level fours which is\nwhat we need to really pay attention to\nuh you know in terms of addressing the\nrural needs but uh getting those numbers\nfor us would be very helpful and and\nyou're really a resource absolutely\nthank you thank you thank you sir\nall right next we have Amy Reeves with\nthe Georgia Board of healthcare\nWorkforce\nand what I'd like to do is we have um\nAmy Reeves now then Jimmy Lewis and then\nwe're going to take a quick break for\nlunch\nand I was thinking about a 30 minute\nbreak uh for lunch\nwhat do you saying\nand then yeah\nso thank you very much\nthat's right at least we're in a\nhospital if anybody needs that's right\ngood morning I think I'll be the last\none to say good morning right that's\nright Mr chairman members of the\ncommittee thank you for allowing us to\nbe with you today it's a real privilege\nmy name is Sheila humberstone I'm with\nStonebridge Consulting and I'm here\ntoday with Amy Reeves who wears a\nmultitude of hats and I'll let her tell\nyou her story but my relationship with\nAmy started because she is the\nlegislative and reimbursement chair for\ngapa the Georgia Association of\nphysician assistants and so we're here\nto talk to you about health care\nWorkforce from the PA perspective so I'm\ngoing to turn it over to Amy\nhi everyone and so um thank you for\nhaving us\num I just wanted to tell you a little\nbit about being a PA and like what what\nit takes to be a pa\num so I did four years of undergrad I\nactually did it in nursing and then I\nworked for four years as a nurse and\nthen went to PA school I looked at both\noptions of nurse practitioner and Pa and\nfor me it was just the PA school was\nwhat I wanted to do and then I've been\nworking as a PA since 2006 whenever I\ngraduated in past board so you have to\ngraduate from a\ngraduate program and before you get in\nyou have to have at least 2 000 of 2000\nhours clinical hours\nand then you also you do rotation so\nit's basically like you're on the same\nrotations as medical students like it's\nrequired you know to be on the rotations\nand get asked questions and reports and\nall that stuff so it's two years at\nleast two years of PA school and then\nafter graduation you take boards and\nthen you have to re-certify every 10\nyears and you have to keep up your\ncontinuing medical education every two\nyears which is 100 hours 50 of those are\ncategory one which are usually from\nconference hours and stuff\nwe work as part of a we work with a\nsupervising physician and as part of a\nhealthcare team we have we can have our\nown patients you know I've worked in\nmany different roles I've worked in the\nNICU and been on like high-risk\ndeliveries I've worked in pediatric\npulmonology where that is you know\ninpatient and outpatient I've done\npediatric ENT which can be as easy as\nlike ear tubes in clinic and tonsils and\nadenoid follow-ups to tracheostomies on\nNICU babies or you know children who\nhave maybe had some sort of accident\num and now I work in general Pediatrics\nand I love it I love every second of\nbeing a PA like it's a wonderful career\nI get to see all the patients I get to\nbe a part of a healthcare team where I'm\nvalued and I enjoy it so much\num\nso as far as I just wanted to kind of go\nover like\num the report from the 2020 Board of\nhealthcare Workforce so I do sit on that\nboard but it's this I'm not representing\nthem today I'm just kind of speaking of\nit\num so the PA's partner with supervising\nPhysicians to practice medicine\nsupervising Physicians can delegate\nmedic medical duties to Pas Pas perform\na vital service to Rural and underserved\nareas of Georgia where there is a\nshortage of practicing physicians in\ndoing so Pas increase the quality and\nquantity of medical services in the\nstate so I've heard this multiple times\nlike you know especially whenever I\nworked at showa there would be you know\nthe Physicians would be scrubbed into\nthe operating room doing sometimes\nfour-hour cases if it's a cochlear\nimplant or you know whatever whatever\nthat surgery entailed neck Mass sections\nand we would be on the floor you know\nseeing the patient evaluating patients\nand Reporting back to them so they\nthey're really like we couldn't see all\nthese patients without you guys so\nthey're very appreciative\num we have\num as far as the last report we had\nwhich was 2020 data we have 4484 Pas\ncurrently licensed and working in\nGeorgia so\num\nat our one of our last meetings with the\nhealthcare Workforce board we talked\nabout why we only had 248 Pas that were\nnewly licensed in the state of Georgia\nin the 2019-2020\num cycle and we're actually working on\ngetting a survey to figure out more of\nwhy we are not getting these PAs to stay\nin Georgia it's going to be modeled very\nsimilar to like medical students and why\nyou know why would why would you choose\nyou know did you is there a significant\nother in another state\num whatever those questions are to try\nto figure out a little bit more so we\nare working on that with goals for the\nDecember 2023 graduates so we are\nworking on a survey to try to help us\nunderstand like why do we have eight PA\nschools and only 248 of those\num\nand that's that also counts people that\nmove to Georgia and get those are newly\nlicensed so that's not only just the\ngraduates but that's also\num that's also to me that was a stunning\nstatistic to think that we have eight PA\nschools and 250 ish people that came in\nand that's not just the new grads like\nAmy said that's new grads as well as\nfolks that might be matriculating to\nGeorgia from other states\num\nit did it did I mean that you know\nthat's that's a piece of it but but\nHealthcare you know occupations\nobviously didn't close and there's a if\nonly an an increased need despite what's\ngoing on\num with any particular infectious\ndisease at the time\nI think Senator Senator Jackson was\nasking yeah I was asking how many\nstudents are they graduating so like\nwhat percent what percentage does 258\nequal are we talking about 10 stay 20\nsay so each PA school has um a cohort\ngroup of about 50 to 60. 60 is usually\nthe maximum and we have eight PA schools\ncurrently with other schools that are in\ntheir pre-pa planning process two more\non the horizon so\num\nwe can do better\nwe can always do better so\num and\nforeign\nand we so the so one of the things that\nwe think that um you know Pas and we've\nseen numerous work Workforce reports\nover the past couple years like senate\ncommittee reports and\num workforce commission reports where\nthey say like you have to utilize your\nfolks at the top of their\num at the top of their level at the top\nof their training level like we have to\nget them out there working and\num you know like we are trying to get\num the hb557 addressed it where we were\ntrying to get some schedule twos where\nwe would be able to write for that when\nit's necessary like we obviously\npractice medicine on our supervising\nphysician so um so like the people who\nneed it the most like there are Pas in\nrural Georgia where there is not a\nphysician in the emergency room like\nit's not an option for them to sign a\nprescription so they are having to admit\npatients to for pain management where\notherwise they'd be able to send them\nhome with a prescription\nthat you know and there's there's other\ninstances too you know and of course we\nwould follow the the pdmp the\nprescription drug monitoring program\num we it always goes with your\nsupervising physician so like on\nPediatrics I don't really need\nhydrocodone there's not really patience\nif my if a patient of mine in general\nPediatrics needs that much pain control\nthey're you know they're getting\nevaluated in an emergency room setting\num it is an issue for\num where I practice we do have some ADHD\npatients and I've seen numerous patients\nthat need their medications refilled and\nthese are psychologist tested ADHD\npatients these are not I think I have\nADHD I want to trial it or whatever so\nthese are these are definitely issues\nthat affect us where it's like you know\nin in 40 something other states if I was\npracticing and seeing my patients I'd be\nable to prescribe that but for right now\nand my doctor's out on maternity leave\nso I'm relying on a locums to help me um\nso I just send her what the prescription\nI need and what the patient's name is so\nit does create more of work load for\nthat but we hear this time and time\nagain especially in like\num in the rural places specifically\nwhere there is\num you know the doctor may not be in the\noffice that day or I hear it from like\npatients who are in oncology that they\ncan't get their pain medicine refilled\num so it's it's definitely an issue in\nmetro Atlanta I know whenever I worked\nin a hospital\num this was whenever we were very full\nand like on diversion and my doctors\nwere scrubbed into the operating room so\nthey couldn't sign a prescription and\nlike literally they were like you are\nbacking up at us admitting patients to\nthe ER because you will not send this\npatient home and I'm like well I can't\nsend them home they don't have their\npain medicine prescription you know so\nit's just the the backlog of how um of\nyou know what how it's not just one\nthing that it affects it's it's multiple\nthings that it puts into play\num\nso anyways I don't think I have any\nother\num comments if you guys have any\nquestions the only thing I will say is\nyou know um not to to bring up a more\nchallenging study committee but the con\ncommittee that met last week there was a\ncardiologist who said something\num I thought really why is he and I'm\ngonna roughly quote him it's a rough\nquote so so let me know on camera let's\nI'm not quoting him directly but he said\nyou know\nthat he is losing recruits right out of\ncollege\nright out of their training because\nquality people require quality\nopportunity\nwe lose applicants to states where there\nis greater opportunity and I think\nthat's sort of the piece of it is how do\nwe make Georgia attractive for those PA\nstudents to want to stay and work and so\ncertainly part of that is making sure\nthat that we're looking at our rules and\nregulations to make sure that if if\nthey're afforded the opportunity to\npractice in a certain way in 48 other\nstates then that probably warrants a\nsignificant conversation we don't we\nknow Georgia is not going to be out\nleading the charge and out in front on\nstuff but when 48 other states do\nsomething there's certainly an argument\nand and you guys heard that and I\nappreciate I think there was only one no\nvote on the Senate side this past\nsession on that bill so we really\nappreciate we really appreciate your\nwork and your effort on that I think the\nother thing and Amy could probably\naddress the the multitude of emails that\nwe got particularly in and around\nDecember of last year but it happens\nwhenever we have a cohort of students\nthat graduate that the the challenges of\ngetting licensed and then getting their\njob description approved because as Amy\nsaid you know and I'm going to say this\nwith no disrespect to the Pas or the\nPhysicians but I like to think simply\nand and try to distill things a PA works\nfor a physician right they're they're in\na collaborative relationship so the PA\nis licensed by the composite medical\nboard so by virtue of having a license\nthat deems you to have met the minimum\nqualifications and be ready to practice\nwhether it's law or you know Road\nbuilding or whatnot once you've got a\nlicense that sort of says that you've\nmet the minimum requirements The\nPhysician is licensed by that same\ncomposite medical board but for us to\nwork together for PA humberston to work\nfor Dr Reeves we've got to go back to\nthat composite Medical Board and get the\njob description signed off at the board\nlevel and that takes a whole lot of time\nif PA humberstone and you'd think these\njob descriptions or robust and flowy\nthey're not they're very simple forms\nbut if PA humberstone leaves and goes to\na different facility and they get\nanother new grad who has the exact same\nyou know capabilities the same school\nthey're going to do the exact same work\nthen we have to go back to the board and\ngot to stop seeing patients go back to\nthat board in order to be able to start\nwork and we had I mean I have\n30 some odd Plus\ndesperate emails from graduates from our\nprograms that were petrified because\nthey were graduating in December they\nhad practiced that you know they had set\nfor their boards and passed their boards\nsome of them had fellowships at\nphenomenal hospitals in Georgia\nlined up but they couldn't start their\nFellowship because of you know\npotentially a two-month lag at the\ncomposite Medical Board to get to get\nthat\njob description and that license\napproved we know we have to be licensed\nthat's not a question but we've got to\nbe creative about finding ways to\nexpedite that process because if when I\nwent to graduate school and I graduated\nwith medical debt it was nothing like\nmedical school debt or PA school debt\nthe thought of not being able to start\nwork on that first day that I have a job\noffer and instead have to sit for two\nmonths\nmeans that if I heard that from my peers\nI'm probably not going to look at\nGeorgia I'm going to look at one of the\nstates where I can start work and start\npaying those loans back fast and I will\nsay again thank you for your work on on\nthe legislation this past year does seek\nto make some tweaks in that area as well\nand there were some additional funding\nfor the composite Medical Board that no\ndoubt will make a difference and so we\nwe appreciate you but Amy's the expert\non how all of this works so I guess\nwe'll turn it over to any questions you\nmight have\nthank you for your Insight that\ninformation Senator Patrick\num yeah my question has to do with the\nsurvey and uh you know we we've tried to\nexpand the\num requiring the information for all\nHealthcare Personnel when they renew\ntheir licenses because we don't know\nwhat's going on out there if we don't do\nthat so I guess my question for you is\nhave you talked with the workforce board\nis that can some of that be done by rule\ndoes that have to have legislation\nso I don't think that's going to be in\nthe legislation in terms of the\nsurveying because we're trying to maybe\na misunderstood we already mandate a lot\nof professionals when they renew their\nlicenses to give us the information on\nhow many hours they work are they going\nto quit in the next five years do they\ntake Medicaid et cetera et cetera et\ncetera so I'm just wondering because we\nhit some roadblocks with getting that\nbill passed last year if any of that can\nbe done by rule that's my question I\nthink for medical schools it is going to\nbe done because it's going to be tied\ninto funds like not as a punishment but\nas an incentive like you're getting\nfunds from us so we have to have this\ninformation because I think HB 1013\naddresses it and says we have to have\nthat information for medical schools the\nPA stuff is\non that requirement on that list but we\nthey're like we've got to figure out why\nwe can't have Pas and I think part of\nwhat we're trying to figure out is not\njust at licensure but why is somebody\nnot getting licensed in Georgia so how\ndo we figure out why P.A Smith who\ngraduated from Emory is never talking to\nthe composite Medical Board never going\nthrough licensure because they've chosen\nto work I get that part but if we don't\neven have the information to begin with\nabout who's even out there that's right\nthen you can't get to that next level\nabsolutely\nthank you all very much thank you for\nbringing that to us\nall right next up we have Jimmy Lewis\nCEO of Hometown health\nand then after uh Mr Lewis we're going\nto take a quick lunch break I'm thinking\n30 minutes and then we'll start back up\nwith a Dr Thomas Hatchett\n[Music]\nforeign\ngood morning thank you for being here\nyou've got a microphone right there as\nwell just so the people that um very\ngood thank you my name is Jimmy Lewis\nI'm CEO of Hometown health\nyou might wonder who is Hometown help so\nI'll give you a briefly of who Hometown\nis and then I'll give you some\ninformation I think you'll find very uh\nvery factual uh Hometown health is an\norganization it's a self-funded\norganization that was formed in about\n1999.\nfor the soul and specific purpose of\ndoing whatever it takes to save rural\nhospitals from closing we've been at it\nfrom then until now we started with one\nwe went to two and currently we have\nabout 20 ftes and they're not ftes they\nare super Specialists and those 20\npeople have 400 years experience in\nhealth care and assorted aspects of of\nHealth Care the function that we provide\nis that of a resource of many facets in\nthe many facets include anything\nnon-clinical we don't get involved in\nthe clinical side of the house because\nthat's a little over our figure eight so\nwe don't do that rather what we do is we\nout we we deal with all of the\noperational reimbursement Financial\nsides of what what goes on and again the\neffort is to do whatever we can to\nprevent one of these hospitals from\nclosing next slide\nthat's what we want to prevent uh that's\nthe first 12 and there's at least six\nmore that could close on any given day\ndepending upon what happens with the\nparticular operation in the uh in the\nhospital we've had many occasions to\ntalk how these things operate uh we\naverage about uh uh four to six events a\nyear to make payroll\nand when you're doing that to make\npayroll of three to five hundred\nthousand dollars a pop and you come up\non Monday and can't make payroll on\nThursday that's a real problem this is\nwhat we're trying to prevent next slide\nwe got a bumpy ride and I want to give\nyou some information to the facts of\nwhat goes on in the marketplace and then\nif you want to discuss them we can do so\nwe've talked today about Workforce\nshortage of the workforce short\nshortages beyond anything we can imagine\nwhen we go into coven and we've got\npeople in the ER that are dying because\nwe can't get enough people to staff the\nbids that's a real problem\nuh physician shortages whether this be\neight thousand whatever the number I did\na Google on that and came up with eight\nthousand we're seriously short with\nrespective positions throughout the\nstate of Georgia and the further you get\ninto rural Georgia the more pronounced\nit it becomes\nGeorgia's unemployment percentage is 3.2\npercent that has a translation that's\nextremely important for us to understand\nin that at three point two percent those\npeople that are unemployable are\nstructurally unemployable\nwhat that really means is they ain't\ngoing to do nothing they can't do any\nthey don't have a skill set they don't\nhave a mental set and that's the real\nproblem that's particularly a problem in\nrural hospitals because if that's the\ncase we we don't have a pool to go to\ndraw from and that's a real that's a\nreal problem Financial stress from the\ncovet and the pandemic uh out of the\ncovid we on the day of the covet when it\nwas announced we ran into a situation\nwhere we had hospitals that couldn't\nmake payroll and we were struggling to\nit the federal government came down and\ngave us a lot of money uh when they gave\nus a lot of money that was really good\nfor the time that it lasted and then we\nfound out they wanted it back and when\nthey wanted it back it's hard to take\nback money from an operation that is so\nuh difficult to deal with so from a\nfinancial stress standpoint we then had\nand today now have many hospitals\noperating with less than two days to ten\ndays cash and if you're running a 20\nmillion operation with 10 days cash I\ndon't have to tell you what kind of pain\nthat is that's a real well that's a real\nproblem we have another item here that\nI'll come back to artificial\nintelligence transition I'll talk to\nthat in a minute the next point to be\nmade is inflation inflation at whatever\nit is and then depending upon the\nspecific item that you're dealing with\ncan range from four to six to ten to\ntwelve percent that's particularly\nproblematic when you're dealing with\ncontracts that are fixed if you've got\nfixed contracts that you don't have the\nopportunity to negotiate a higher rate\nand inflation is going up at 10 and you\ncan't get another two percent in the\nnext five years and you're automatically\nputting yourself out of out of business\nthe next one is an interesting one and\nthere are 10 State initiatives going on\nsimultaneously right now that are\nkilling the entire industry but\nspecifically in that of Rural and these\n10 initiatives include things like the\nCMOS the rfps the Medicaid unwinding\nPathways provider uh credentialing what\nwe were just talking about here and for\nthese hospitals that are already\nresource limited and to have to do this\nkind of work we don't have the resources\nto do it and we can't find the resources\nto do it nor could we teach them on a\ntimely enough fashion to make that work\nI say the next one is an economy\nconsuming labor when UPS announces\nthey're paying 21 a pop and Walmart's\ntaking that same situation they're\nconsuming everything that we've got to\nprovide care with the next subject is\nparamix and paramix is how we get paid\nMedicare Medicaid self-pay commercial\nand such it's kind of interesting to see\nthat we have gone from a a Medicare to a\nMedicare Advantage population and that\nMedicare Advantage population one could\nmake the case that the federal\ngovernment has used using that to cut\nrates and and what is happening is in\nthe rural communities uh we'll find that\nthey'll get those people will get posted\nat the front door of Walmart so they can\nmake sure that they take all of the new\npeople coming in and convert them to\nMedicare Advantage from Medicare and\nthat's really a problem on the\nparticular pair mix that we're dealing\nwith you may or may not hear about this\nnext one it's the 340b the 340b is a\ndrug program it's designed to help rural\nhospitals and it does a very good job\nbut there's a tremendous amount of\npressure on them to solve this problem\nand eliminate actually and then the last\none is transport issues and we've got\nsituations now where we have hospitals\nthat have to pay to have the patient\nbrought to the hospital that's a real\nproblem but the one I want to mention is\nartificial intelligence transition and I\ndrive my people nuts on this uh this\nartificial intelligence intelligence\ntransition if I can stress anything to\nyou that's going to have influence over\nany and everything of what you do I do\nwe do and healthcare does it's going to\nbe artificial intelligence this is and\nwill transform every aspect of our lives\nand it will be beyond anything we can\nimagine and the reason that's so\nimportant in rural communities we've got\nto learn how to do it and with the\nalready stretch situation that we got\nlearning how to do it is a real uh is a\nreal problematic situation next slide\nuh overall Workforce considerations we\ntalked about an aging employee base\naging general population tight pipelines\nof where to get people in employment\napathy uh and turn over amongst the the\ncurrent employment next line\nthis is kind of an interesting one but\nemployee turnover uh I this came to my\nattention on occasion about 10 years ago\nwhen I suddenly did an analysis on CEO\nturnover CEO turnover typically runs 25\nto 30 percent per year think about it\nwhen the leadership is turning that fast\nand doing what it does with that kind of\nturn then what happens is the ability to\nhave continuity of strategy is zero and\nthat that leads to major problems both\nat the board level and the hospital\nlevel and those kind of things and this\nis just some of the turnovers that we\nexperienced and we've heard all the\nmorning about training these people as\nthey turn over it's just virtually\nimpossible to do so next slide\nokay the problems that are exacerbated\nin rural we've talked about them and I\nwon't get in all of this being let's go\nto the next one\nthe next one is where we start if we got\nall these problems where are the\nsolutions well I'll give you some\nsolutions okay now you won't lack of\nsolutions but I'm going to give you the\nsolutions because they're known to work\nbut they're challenging the first\nsolution is cash it's all about cash we\ncan talk about every other thing that we\nwant to talk about but if we don't talk\nabout cash we don't talk about nothing\nit's all about cash we'd like to think\nthat we clinically are solvent and all\nthis kind of stuff but that's not true\nwe are cash insolvent and we're cashing\nsolvent because we're turning away all\nsorts of services that we should be\ndealing with so we're going to deal with\nit we need a couple of policy changes\nthe first policy changes we here goes\nuh the first policy changes we need to\nimplement Medicaid expansion\nI said we we need to implement Medicaid\nexpansion and we've come a long way on\nthat subject but if we don't do that\nwe're leaving cash on the table that\notherwise could go into the community\nand provide a a growth of the service\nlevel of Medicaid and all of the health\ncare programs that we've got I'll leave\nthat one alone the next one's even more\nhot than this one we've got 159 counties\nand with 159 counties we got to find a\nway to do some kind of Municipal\nconsolidation of A Sort period I mean\nit's just it that's just what we got to\ndo if we don't do that we will leave all\nof that money on the table that we can't\nget to and that that whole consolidation\nsubject is the consolidation of counties\nthe consolidation of area Services of\nthe collaboration of local services and\nto consolidate local area contracts such\nas health care insurance property and\nyou say well how in the world are you\ntalking about all this stuff I can tell\nyou that last week I carried part of our\nteam to the field and we went to eight\nhospitals 400 miles in two days and\ntalked to all eight boards\nthat's what they said next slide\nboth of those things all of it next line\nprobably casualty I don't smell too good\nsometimes\nso the the next Solutions are kind of\ninteresting because these are all proven\nSolutions these are not what is these\nare these are things that work\ntelemedicine telemedicine is the key to\nwhat we do when it comes to the delivery\nof The Clinical Services we got a great\nprogram over at Augusta that goes out to\n13 to 15 hospitals they have access to\nhealth care in the ER at the patient\nlevel in the hospital and we can keep\nthe patient in the hospital and provide\nservices at home and not have to carry\nthem to the to the uh to the trauma\ncenter the next one is hello we need to\ndo scope expansion and do all the\nresearch pertaining the scope expansion\nof services I mean if we are short of\nnurses and we got or whatever and we've\ngot some way to expand the scope of\nservices this is the thing in the time\nnow that we need to be doing that the\nnext one is kind of an interesting we\ncan go back on the history of it but the\nfact of the matter is we need to\nincrease the hospital tax credit to 150\nmillion dollars for this reason that is\nthe cleanest most direct infusion of\ncash that I've seen in my 25 years of\ntrying to figure out how to get money\ninto the to the communities and for as\nmuch as we can do that that puts the\nownership of Health Care back into the\nlocal community Through the donors that\nmake the money work in the local level\nit's working doing really good we just\nneed to do more of it to make it work\nthat much better\nreplenish the fund State Office of real\nhealth\nthis is an opinion\nit's totally Unthinkable that we would\ncut the State Office of rural Health to\nless than three million dollars after\nwe'd got the known proven programs that\nwere I mean it's just crazy and and\nwe're trying to figure out how to save\nrural hospitals and we're cutting the\nway that these folks back here know how\nto do it and they do it extremely well\nand the next one is kind of an\ninteresting one as well we need to\nsubsidize OB\nand you said that's crazy we don't need\nto do that well we closed 14 OBS because\nwe couldn't pay for them you know why we\ncouldn't pay for them because we were\nlosing a million dollars a year on each\none of them when we do that we impute\nthe poor quality of maternal care into\nthe community by doing and this is real\nsimple the reason most of those closed\nis because they were losing one million\ndollars a year if we were to subsidize\n14 hospitals at a million a piece that's\n14 million dollars on a 30 billion\ndollar operation for a budget is is that\npeanuts or what we need to figure out\nhow to do this because for the reason\nthat we closed the OB units as we did we\ndid it just on the numbers but the real\nnumbers are the loss of economic\ndevelopment that occurs shortly after\nyou get rid of the OB because it just it\nwipes everything out so what we have is\na consolidation of uh those kind of\nservices and the losses just eat them\nalive and then the last one was kind of\ninteresting we need to figure out how to\ncreate a rural stopping for Physicians\nto keep them in rural communities fifty\nthousand a pop or whatever but we say we\ncan't do that well we can't do that so\nwe'll just train them and let them go to\nanother state and we look at the dollars\nand cents associated with senator the\nstate it ain't real smart next slide\nthere you have it\nso a couple of things of interest that\nwe have learned\nagain we got 20 people we're virtual we\ndon't have an office our office is an\nemail address it's been that way from\nday one we don't sink a bunch of money\ninto excess overheads whatsoever we put\nour money into people and smarts and\nsoftware and things that work uh we\noperate with the most advanced software\nfrom an operational standpoint we focus\non several things one of which is\nreimbursement we have developed\nreimbursement programs and we've got 700\ncourses I think 700 courses that we've\ndeveloped we have 20 000 students online\nAcross the Nation and they're dealing\nwith reimbursement and how to how to\nfile claims better and make sure you get\npaid for what you get uh for what you're\noperating on we we do this extensively\nand it works and we've got hospitals all\nover the nation uh that are that have\nproven the success of it Georgia is very\nvery powerfully successful in doing this\nand State Office of real Health we work\ndirectly with them and and using this\nkind of networking uh networking\noperation the next thing we do is we\ncapitalize on technology from our\nbusiness partners we have 70 business\npartners that help us fund all this\nproject okay I mean it's truly a wild\ncrazy project but it's been fairly\nsuccessful and the 70 business partners\nthat we have started out being the\nfundamental business partners and I say\nfundamental because that was a little\nbit about accounting and a little bit\nabout painting and a little bit we have\nmoved far beyond that in that our\nbusiness partners now are technology\nadvanced to lead us into artificial uh\ntechno the whole artificial intelligence\nprogram and those 70 business partners\njoin us twice a year and and they fund\nthe program but they help us twice a\nyear and we have 200 people that attend\nfor the purpose of understanding what\nthey know great job we use the the best\ntechnology and Advanced Communications\nwe've done over 100 webinars thus far\nthis year teaching these people what\ngoes on with Medicaid and Medicare and\nall of those kind of things so it works\nI share all that with you to say if we\ndon't do this we got six more that we\ncan lose tomorrow and after that we're\ncreating a third world nation far beyond\nanything we've seen and on the OB Side\nof the house it's important to note that\nthat translates into a desert below I-20\nthat makes South Georgia Yonder city\nthank you\nthank you if you have any questions I\nknow Senator Patrick sorry I always have\nno you're good this is what we're here\nfor so I just I don't want to throw the\nstate of Georgia under the bus on some\nof the things that you talked about\nbecause a lot of these are federal\nprograms so we have to do the Medicaid\nand winding is federal the revalidation\nis federal so we're doing the best we\ncan in Georgia to try to deal with that\nand so the federal government we're\ndoing everything\nwe're doing everything we can to assist\nin the training to help in that\nparticular situation but sometimes the\nfeds aren't as Cooperative as they could\nbe got it and we also have done some\nthings in Georgia that have been\nbeneficial and I have to give\ncommissioner former commissioner Kelly\nnoggle some credit for getting the\ndirective payment program going make no\nmistake about it it ain't the whole\nthing but it's a very good program\nexcellent we work directly with them and\nthat that is clearly a very good program\nmoney left on the table for years for no\napparent reason we also have a pretty\nrobust service cancelable Loan program\nfor Rural Physicians already so um I\njust want George to get some credit for\nsome of the good things we've done but I\ndo have a question for you I was not\nfamiliar with having to prepay for\ntransports yeah we got hospitals that\nare doing that dig into that a little\nbit more it's just very simple we got\nwe got transport that says you pay us\nwe'll bring them\nfor emergency\nservices\nnot emergency but transport I'll just\nsay transport I qualify that\nyou go into that a little bit more what\nkind of are we talking about like we're\ntalking about getting a patient to the\nhospital okay what's your typical\npatient that they would call a hospital\nfor are they picking them up from their\nhouse are they taking them from One\nhospital to another hospital there are a\nlot of different scenarios that patients\nare transported in rural communities\nI'll just leave it at that\nyou go in for treatments you go in for\nemergency you're going for candy bars\nno you don't but\num\ndo you have a follow-up Center capacity\nlet me ask you this one of the solutions\nyou mentioned was telemedicine yeah sure\nwhat can we do as a state to help with\nthe telemedicine or is that something\nthat's already there that needs to be\nit's already there\nit needs to continue to be upgraded in\npayments and use of system\nuh all of this is about cash\nif there ain't cash to follow it it\nain't gonna happen and that's what we\nhave to do with with telemedicines\ncontinue to pump cash into it to provide\nusers the interesting thing and you know\na lot of this is controversial what I'm\ntelling you but this won't be any\ndifferent okay so the situation with\ntelemedicine is uh we have two uses of\ntelemedicine we have some senior users\nof telemedicine we have some not senior\nusers of telemedicine and the younger\npeople come out played with video games\nand they're all about tell them us and\nwe still are struggling on some\noccasions with older Physicians who just\ndon't want to get into telemedicine\ntelemedicine is clearly without a shadow\nof a doubt proven remote patient\nmonitoring is the name of the game\nperiod That's is it and there's no real\nreason to talk about that I'll you\ndidn't ask this question but but I have\na question to answer for you uh yes\nthat's that whole subject of certificate\nof need with respect I fought all sides\nof certificate of need but I can tell\nyou that the threat to the certificate\nof need for a rural community is the\nloss of Imaging and what goes with it\nwhen there's an Imaging Center put up in\nthe neck closest town and it sucks all\nof the patients out of the rural\ncommunities the other problem that goes\nwith that also is we've got a situation\nwith insurance companies where we have a\nwe have an occasion where uh\nthe patient gets prescribed a need and\nbefore that patient can get on the\ninsurance companies call to get them to\ntransfer their care to another another\nunit somewhere out of the local\ncommunity that's what will happen I mean\nwe could we could have situations where\nwe could suck up rural hospitals in a\nheartbeat like that\nyes sir\num\none thing that you mentioned that I had\nnot heard is that the CEO turnover is 30\npercent per year in Georgia did you say\ndid you say it's range from 20 to 31 or\ntwo you can find that in Beckers ex can\nyou go into that a little bit as to why\nyou think that turnover is occurring and\nI guess what we could do\nfirst and foremost is burnout it's\nkilling them I mean there's there's just\nthere's just insufficient backup we do\nstrategic plans and we do succession\nplanning and all that kind of stuff\nthere isn't a succession plan there\nain't no backup there's there's just\nthere's just no inventory of people\ncoming along and as a result of people\nthat are there they go they just burn\nout and when they burn out it's kind of\nlike you know big tree of fire it just\nFalls over and that's it is it a\nis it something that could be addressed\nat the college level with programs in\nthe state of Georgia that would prepare\npeople to become CEOs of hospitals is it\na hospital management course or or I\nguess curriculum uh first of all it's\nabout education but more importantly and\nall that's about the money\nif enough people are paid enough money\nto get into the program then they will\nable to educate themselves and go work\nin the rural hospitals but the problem\nis you got to have people\nthat have a A literacy level that can\nsupport what's required to go into uh\ngoing to hospital and and and make no\nmistake CEO work at a large hospital is\nwork hard work CEO work at a small rural\nhospital is unimaginable because that's\nthe one where you got to go tear out the\ngarbage and clean out the toilets and do\nall of that stuff just to be the CEO to\nhelp the nurses on the floor\nyou just had to have been there to see\nwhat it's like when\nthat happens and then the last solution\nthat I was going to ask about is the\nscope expansion could you go into that a\nlittle bit with the crnas LPNs RNs\nwhat's their role in rural hospitals how\ndo you think that they're\num I guess scope expansion can help\ndope expansion can help\nby allowing certain services to do more\nthings under their license than they\ncurrently do\nnow I'm going to give you an example\nthat's not the proper example but it was\nan example I grew up in a little town I\nmean Cordele and when court is a little\ntown now but Cordell was a little town\nwhen I grew up in it the thing that was\nmost interesting about expansion of\nservices was the second best doctor in\ntown was the doctor's brother who was a\npharmacist\nand he did his own expansion of services\nyeah and in a rural community\nwe need to look at how that works we\nneed we need to find better ways you had\na question\ndo you have several questions\num so one I'm curious about your\nincentives for Physicians to practice\nfull-time in rural communities we heard\nearlier that there's already an 85\nretention rate if we can get them there\nthen they will stay there so why do you\nfeel like we need to offer them\nadditional money we got to get them\nthere to get them there yeah so what if\nwe had a one-time settlement fee instead\nof a a yearly whatever it takes to get\ncash there okay and then my other\nquestion\num back to kind of scope of care and you\nmay not be the best person to answer\nthis but are there\num are there rules and regulations that\nare preventing people from practicing at\nthe top of their scope already so we\nheard that previously about Pas in my\nexperience as an EMT there were rules\nand regulations that prevented me from\noperating at the top level have we\nevaluated that to make sure that people\nwithin their already trained so instead\nof expanding scope of care they're\nalready being trained to do certain\nthings about our rules and regulations\nare preventing them from operating at\nthe very top I'm not the proper person\nanswer that that's that's what I figured\num\nGod\nabsolutely\ntheir rules and regulations in Georgia\nthat's why 48 states\nallow Advanced nurses to do to practice\nat their full training George is one of\ntwo that doesn't and we fought this\nbattle every year since I've been in the\nSenate eight years and it's uh\nyou know mag fights us on it every time\nit's not just advanced practice nurses\nbut that it's across the field that we\nhave a number of Allied Services or a\nnumber of places where people are not\nworking at the top of their scope is my\nsense I'll mention this very quickly in\nJefferson the chairman over here that is\nwe've had many many conversations about\nwhat goes on in the rule because he's\nrural now the important part about that\nis the fact that he is in communication\nwith rural on a daily basis\ny'all need to be in communication with a\nrule on a daily basis just to see what\nit's about if you hadn't and see what\ngoes on there because he and I have many\nconversations about what's going on in\nthe rural community and some of them are\nUnthinkable but they're real and you as\nlegislators are are there to make the\nchanges or adhere to the changes or\nwhatever but you got to be there and you\ngot to hear it you got to listen to it\nit's\neverybody in this Healthcare field\nunderstood what you understand about\nMedicaid expansion\nit's all about money\nmoney it is Cash dollars it is money and\nyou used to oppose it and you changed\nyour mind\nand now you're outspoken about it and\nand we have a Hospital Association in\nAlabama that that loudly\nproclaimed the need for Medicaid\nexpansion it's all about the cash that's\nthat's what it is it's money it's money\nand it's and it's the jobs and the\ninfrastructure funding that that money\nwill do will do you know what the\ngreatest will ever you know what the\ngreatest in my opinion the greatest\nleverage to deal with the redirection of\nmoney is\nthe CMO contract\nthe state CMO contract\nif we figured out how to properly\nnegotiate those contracts on behalf of\nthe state\nand follow the money\nthere it is\nwell Mr Lewis we appreciate you being\nthank you for listening while we think\nwe may have all the answers to all the\nproblems in the state this is uh uh you\ndid bring us some good solutions for\nRural health care and you know I think\nas we continue through this process\nwe're going to see that the needs of\nrural Health Care versus the needs of\nUrban Healthcare are very different and\npeople fighting\nwell people fighting for the hang on a\nsecond please people fighting for the\nbest of their patience\nthey have different interests in rural\nversus urban areas we're here for Rural\nand I really appreciate you coming\ncoming today thank you very much so\nwe're going to take a quick break we\nhave lunch for everyone\num in in the adjoining room uh let's say\nit's 11 58 now let's start back at uh\n12 30\num with Dr Hatchet and y'all\nMiss Bernita is telling me to direct\ny'all through the double doors please\nthank y'all\nforeign\nall the members are back we're gonna get\nstarted uh next up we have Dr Hatchet\nyeah\nmy dad\nuh my name is Tommy hatch and I'm an OB\nGYN I've practiced here for\n30 years and um\nmy goal today is to try not to embarrass\nmy son\num\ntoday I wanted to just kind of tell a\nstory of the Habersham County experience\nwhat we've gone through with our rural\nhospital and the challenges that we've\nfaced over the last 70 years basically\nand uh\nto share some of the things that we\nwe did well some of the things we didn't\ndo so well and then to talk about\nphysician recruitment I had the honor of\nworking on the Georgia Board for\nphysician Workforce for a dozen years\nwith Senator Kirkpatrick for a while and\nwe did our best to make a difference\nthere and um\nso\nthat's what we're doing today\num so this hospital was prior to in the\nlate late 40s and early 50s if I'm an OB\nGYN so some of my comments may be in\nthat direction but if you were going to\nhave a baby in Habersham County and not\nhave it at home you would have it at the\ncharm house which is a beautiful Annie\nBella mansion in Clarksville up here\nthey still have a room upstairs with a\nglass window and that was the nursery\nbut in 1953 this hospital was built and\nthere were 53 beds and that's basically\nwhat it's been since then\nin 1991 there was a large addition\nthat was undertaken and it was at this\ntime that I actually got to see this\nfacility it was still under construction\nI was a third year resident and that's\nwhen I decided to come to this area I\nattended the State Medical fair in\nAtlanta\nand decided to come to Habersham County\nto raise raise our kids and um\nwe decided why not come to a place that\nsome people like to vacation and live so\num so that that happened in 1991 then in\n2008 we had another large addition and\nthat's that's the facility that you're\nin currently\num it was a 36 million Edition and\nrefinancing of the the county bonds\nand uh and then just earlier this year\nthe facility was purchased we finally\ncompleted a an agreement and uh it was\npurchased by North Northeast Georgia\nHealth System so that's that's where we\nare today\nnow during that time the regional\nhospital there were only about five\nthree to five Physicians that were here\nthat started this that was started with\nthe hospital\nand that in 1978 the hospital kind of\ngotten some financial trouble\none of the themes of our history\nand like many other hospitals and uh so\nthey we brought in\na management team from Quorum our HCA\nand that was required by the that was a\nrequirement placed on the hospital\nAuthority by the county and so that led\nus up to 1991 in 1991 there was\napproximately 25 Physicians here and I'm\ngoing to refer to them as community\nphysicians they lived here they worked\nhere they had privileges at the hospital\num\nover the next uh\nlet's see 17 17 years or so that 2025 is\na mistake I apologize for that but over\nthe next 20 or 17 years or so the number\nof community-based active staff\nPhysicians remained at 25.\nbut unlike some other rural areas\nHabersham County continued to grow in\n1991 the population was approximately 30\n33 000. now it's uh it's getting close\nto 50 000. we're up around 47 000. so\nwe've had a pretty pretty uh stable\ngrowth throughout this whole time\nfortunately however our our medical\nstaff did not grow\nthat asterisk up there is mainly the the\nway we were able to accommodate the\nincreased growth and increased number of\npatients was with nurse practitioners\nand PAs\nand during while I was on the healthcare\nboard that was a really hard thing to\ntrack we tracked we could track\nphysician licenses and physician surveys\nso I I hope that with the with the name\nchange and the and the able to maybe\nassimilate some of the nursing data and\nthe PA data that we were able to get\nbetter numbers so we could really tell\nwhat was happening as far as Workforce\nin the in the various counties in\nGeorgia\num so that was you know that that was\nkind of the\nBeginning of the End uh\nwe had this great facility in 2008\num you might compare it to an airline\nthat had maybe a couple of dozen brand\nnew\n737s or triple sevens we had had all the\nfacilities but we didn't have the pilots\nto fly the planes\num and I'm not trying to to over\nemphasize Physicians but you have to\nthere that's part of the solution along\nwith nurses I mean there's we have to\nhave personnel\nso from 2008 to 2023 the number of\nfull-time Physicians\nliving in our community you know calling\nthis their home that were on active\nstaff here dropped it's from 25 to about\n10.\num\nnow we were able to run the hospital\nbecause we had doctors that came in\ndoctors that staffed our hospitalist\nservice doctors that staffed our our ER\nin that same time period from 1991 to\nthe present we went from approximately\n10 surgeons that were\nfighting for space and three ORS to two\nsurgeons two to three surgeons that were\nworking out of five ORS and that's\num if you're spending that many millions\nof dollars and you're building a 24 bed\noutpatient surgery unit that's not a\nthat's not a way to to make your\ninvestment work\nso um that's that was one of the one of\nthe many contributors to uh what led to\nthe dire financial times that we\nexperienced in the last year to where we\nwere down to\nless than one day's cash on hand\nthe huge threat of the of the facility\nclosing\nso fortunately that didn't happen we\nwere able to to work with Northeast\nGeorgia Health Systems and we\nwe are on our way up again\num so now there's a lot of benefits to\npracticing in rural rural areas and I\njust wanted to touch on some of those\nyou can make a meaningful impact in your\npatients lives you get to see and\ninteract with them on a daily basis it\nreally it really gives you\naccountability\num my wife likes to joke about how many\npatients I see when we go to Walmart and\nuh\num being a ob gyn sometimes those\nconversations are not\nprobably not for Walmart so but\num\nit's I feel like in a rural area it's\neasier to have a better life work\nbalance to be able to raise if you know\nraise your family do the things you like\nto do to your hobbies to do Recreation\nuh outside\nwhen I one of the first weeks I was here\nof a doctor who had been here a younger\ndoctor he later became the mayor of\nClarksville he took me to go fishing and\nhere I am\npracticing OB GYN in a small area\nI'm on call and we drive up about 10\nminutes from here and we wade into the\nWaters of the sequoi river\nand we're fly fishing in a deer walks\nacross the stream right when I caught a\nfish and it was just kind of\nsurreal that you can do this and be on\ncall it's maybe a little more\nchallenging to do that if you're in\nmetro Atlanta\nwell you don't have to but the\nChattahoochee is a lot bigger down there\num we have less less traffic less crime\nI have a five minute commute to work\nthrough three stop signs\num and uh I was thinking about it a lot\nof people probably practicing in Atlanta\nhave\num\na 30-minute commute from where they live\nto where they where they work in the\nhospitals and that by Atlanta standards\nthat's not really bad but uh you if you\nlook at an that's 30 minutes each way or\nan hour hour a day that's five hours a\nweek or 250 hours\na year that's almost six weeks\nthat you're in the car\nand so I like I like my five minute\ncommute\num I mentioned the recreational\nactivities and also part an opportunity\nto become really part of your community\nto do the things that that are your\npassion and to have a meaningful impact\num as far as recruitment there are\nvarious levels that\nyou can focus on\num Dr Burke this morning shared with me\na great story about how his community\nhospital basically paid for locals local\nstudents to go to medical school and\nthat student came back and was able to\npay back that debt by by working so\nthat's a local opportunity that that\ncommunities have to\naffect their physician Workforce\nso the community can be involved in\nrecruiting\nindividuals\nwho have relationships with the\nhospitals the hospital can involve them\nwhen they're interviewing doctors\nespecially board members when I was here\nthe the board members that was that was\nwhat they do they took doctor\nprospective doctors out to to dinner and\ntold them about their\nabout their Community what it was like\nto live here local businesses should get\ninvolved to the Chamber of Commerce\nBanks and Realtors certainly have a very\nvested interest in in recruiting\nPhysicians to come practice in a\ncommunity\nat the state level\nand this is where a lot of thought was\nplaced especially on the workforce board\nthere are many things that can do and\nthey a lot of them involve money but\nothers don't the tax credits I I think\nthere are tax credits available to to\nPhysicians who practice in rural areas I\ndon't know how effective those are loan\nrepayments are huge I think that's a\nbetter way to focus when we were on the\nphysician Workforce board there were a\nlot of scholarships that people were\ngiven when they first start to medical\nschool and they may think they're going\nto medical school to be a primary care\ndoctor or work in a rural area but they\nmay want to be a specialist and you\ndon't know until you get there\nso if you took a loan to\nto go to a rural area but you know\nHabersham County or Eastman Georgia or\nBainbridge don't need neurosurgeons so\nyou're you're kind of out of luck and if\nyou don't repay those loans you're you\nhave to pay triple triple damages but\nthose\num we've kind of phased those out and\nthat's that's uh been an improvement but\nloan repayments everybody has student\nloans and so that's the way that the\nstate can help to recruit Physicians to\nrural areas in 2005 around that time the\nmalpractice environment in Georgia was\nwas very bad we only had two two\ncompanies that were that were basically\nensuring Physicians here but through\nsome meaningful tort reform that we got\ndone at that time we were able to\nmake it a better environment here and we\nbecause of that many other companies\nwere able to come into Georgia and help\nensure\nPhysicians and uh and in doing so the\nthe rates the malpractice insurance\nrates dropped which that was a good\nthing and that's something that can be\ndone at the state level\nand then Medicaid reimbursement\nyou know it the Medicare reimbursement\nrates for Georgia should you know should\nbe compared to this definitely the\nsurrounding states and other states in\nthe South and if you want doctors to\ncome practice in Georgia you should try\nto make Georgia the most attractive\nstate in the country to practice and you\ncan do that with some of these things\nthat's a you know that's that's just a a\ngoal that when you're looking at\nStaffing Georgia and Staffing the rural\nareas that's one one kind of test to to\nsee if it's going to be if it's going to\nwork is it going to make Georgia more\nattractive than other places to practice\nmedical schools have a have a a big role\nin recruiting doctors to rural areas\nencouraging primary care I think Mercer\nmedical school is a great example of\nthat they do an incredible job and\nstudents coming in there know that\nthat's kind of the the route rural\nscholarships are helpful and also\ngetting the getting the students out\ninto rural areas to work with community\nphysicians so they can learn what it's\nreally like to practice in these areas\ncan be very effective in in helping to\nrecruit to rural areas\npme or graduate medical education is\nprobably the biggest opportunity\nwe surveyed doctors when they were\nleaving residency\nabout where they were going to practice\nand where they did their residency was\none of the was basically more important\nthan where they went to medical school\nand even where they were from so we're\nso getting those graduate programs into\nRegional areas is a huge step so we've\nyou know it used to be Augusta and\nAtlanta with only places you could train\nin Georgia now we've got Macon and we've\ngot Savannah and we've got Gainesville\nand a lot of other I think I believe\nRome and Albany so lots and even\nColquitt County and and they've done\nreally done a good job in trying to get\nthose residents educated in the rural\nareas so there'd be more likely to stay\nthere I'm really excited in Gainesville\nwhich is about 30 minutes down the road\nwe've got\nseveral residency programs especially\nfamily practice emergency medicine\ngeneral surgery which is greatly needed\nthroughout the rural areas so hopefully\nsome of those graduates are going to be\ncoming to the rural areas\nso in in uh in conclusion uh\ncommunities and hospitals need to\nidentify the doctors that they can bring\nto their areas but those doctors also\nneed to know that that's where they want\nto go to so you can't put a round peg in\na square hole we can't sell Habersham\ncounties Atlanta and Atlanta can't try\nto\nto\nserve up a position that really wants to\nbe in a rural area too\nand there's lots of ways to do that it's\nI\nif we can maybe tear down some of those\nsilos that were mentioned\nand and get other agencies to work\ntogether all for the common goal it\nwould be a great way to\nfor everyone to work on the same page\nand everyone to to run the relay race\nthe first Speaker this morning did a\ngreat job she presented so much\ninformation and I hope I haven't been to\nredundant so any any questions I could\nanswer\nSenator compassion thank you for what\nyou do in the trenches every day it\nmatters a lot and I didn't realize until\nyou said you'd been in practice 30 years\nwhich is how long I was in practice\nbefore I retired that I'm old enough to\nbe his mother but\nbut what I was gonna I was gonna second\nwhat you said about graduate medical\neducation I think that's a key piece of\nthe puzzle that we can do more with\nbecause medical school's one thing but\nwhere you do your residency matters a\nlot in terms of whether you stay or go\none question I had as you the number of\ndoctors that the attrition over the\nyears was\nvery startling to see on a slide\nwas that just people edging out or was\nthere something else going on it was\nsome aging out some moving moving to\nother locations just not getting the\nsupport they needed\num\nbut yeah that that was basically it we\num I don't know it's a number a number\nof factors that went into that\nbut it was it was a fact in that again\nyou can't\nyou can't have a great facility unless\nyou have the Personnel to to to work in\nand you have to what all boils down to\nthe patients the patients you have to\nhave patience if you want a successful\nfacility you have to have patience and\nuh\nand without without the Physicians to\nbring those patients to the hospital\nit's uh it's it's you're not getting\nyour return on your investment um the\nin addressing the other\nyour point\num in the Medical College of Georgia OB\nGYN program\num residency began sending doctors to\nRome Georgia to do rotations there\num because they're they're just not\ngetting the number of cases that they\nneed to to satisfy their residency\nrequirements and I've been also able to\nhave those residents come rotate with me\nand operate with me just to to get those\nand that's a they they've been effective\nin Rome and in helping in basically\nretaining some of those residents they\nget to see what it's like to practice in\nRome Georgia and some of those those\ngraduates have gone to Rome to practice\nso we've started that here and hopefully\nwe'll see those same fruits of our labor\nany other questions\nSenator Walker\nuh daughter Hatchet thank you for your\npresentation and uh it's great to see\nyou again\nI have recently visited in Dublin at\nFairview Park hospital with the uh CEO\nover there Don Avery and his senior\nstaff and chairman had the other\nchairman Hatchet uh uh Matt Hatchett and\nI met with them and they've made a real\nconcerted effort for really decades now\non physician Recruitment and just from\nthe outside looking in it appears to me\nthat well they've been successful doing\nit first of all but it appears to me\nthat it's been a real Community effort\nover there and that the community\nrecognizes the value of bringing in\nPhysicians and how it impacts their\nquality of life their health care but\nalso their economy and so the whole\ncommunity's got behind it so I think\nthat's a real valid point that you made\non the on the community part I do want\nto I'm not are you familiar with the\nprogram the rural physician program that\nMercer University has I think Governor\nDeal started it but they they also have\na rural physician scholarship program\nthat's that's been successful well do\nyou know about that or\nyeah a certain brother of mine works\nkind of for Mercer too and he may or may\nnot have made a phone call to me about a\ngraduating resident who in OB GYN who\nhad the Nathan Deal scholarship and uh\nso I may or may not have made contact\nwith this President and she may not have\nor she delivered uh two she did two\nC-sections this morning while we were\nmeetings she she joined uh basically\num I I my practice I had this I had my\npractice here for 30 years and it just\nbecame necessary\nfor one thing to recruit other doctors\nso by joining with Northeast Georgia\nMedical Center I was able to recruit Dr\nHoward to join us so I think that's a\ngreat a great program and Dr Howard has\nbeen a has been a godsend so uh that at\nSuper and it's it's ironic that both she\nand I live in the Clarksville area only\nabout five or ten minutes from Governor\ndeals so we're I'm trying to arrange a\nbreakfast so we can all get together\nwell thank you\nyeah thank you so much and uh great to\nmeet you for the first time we've been\nenjoy working with your son and your\nbrother I take it in the house\num\nwhat's what's the impact of uh over and\nover doctors that deliver babies are\ngoing out of the business\nand um\nhow does that impact the whole you know\nwhere does where does that play in the\ndynamic of keeping a hospital in a\nmedical Community Bible with Services\nit's you know a vital fundamental\nservice that we're going to need babies\nare going to keep coming yeah yeah I\nmean you're looking at the start of life\nand um\nI I can't I'm not a hospital\nadministrator and I don't run hospitals\nbut uh you know I heard it from previous\nadministrators that if you can take care\nof a mother who's having her baby and\nyou do a good job of doing that then\nshe's going to bring her baby back to\nthis hospital if the baby gets sick or\nif she gets sick and then she's gonna if\nher husband needs medical care she's\ngoing to bring her husband here because\nthe women often are control the health\ncare in the family and then they're\ngoing to bring then she's going to bring\nher parents or her in-laws to take to\nhere so if you can start with that\ninitial you know labor and delivery in\nthe emergency department are usually the\nfirst the two doors that most people get\ntheir first experience in a hospital so\nif you can do a good job delivering\nbabies\nas well as the emergency department\nyou know you're more likely to have a\npatient for for life that will will um\npatronize your hospital so that's it's\nvery very important and it saddens me\nthe hospital in Stevens County which is\nonly 20 20 minutes from here their labor\nand delivery was forced to close uh\nwithin the last year or two\num\nand the farther a woman has to go from\nher home to deliver a baby the more\nlikely she is to have a a an adverse\noutcome if you're less than 45 minutes\nyou've got a pretty good good chance if\nyou're over 45 minutes which we have\npatients in Northern Raven County that\nthere's we're the basically the closest\nhospital to them and some of them have\nhave\nyou know\nare high-risk pregnancies so we we're we\ncan still take care of them and I'm I'm\nhopefully that this practice is going to\ncontinue to grow and we'll be able to do\nthat um but I don't I don't think they\nshould have to travel two hours to the\nmain campus in Gainesville or even to\nAtlanta for care\nbecause bad things will you know bad\nthings can happen that's that's another\nopportunity for telemedicine\ntelemedicine has some really there's\nsome things that does not so good but\nsome things that can do very well and\nand allowing women to have consults with\num higher perinatologists high-risk\npregnancy doctors or for babies in Us in\nrural areas to be able to use\ntelemedicine for them to get the the\nrecommendations from neonatologists uh\nit's huge it's a huge opportunity\nespecially and how is how has that\nplayed out in this hospital setting uh\nthe\nwhat you just described well we have we\nhad that service the the telemedicine\nwhere we had a physician in Atlanta that\nwas providing that service and the\npatients instead of having to go to\nAtlanta or Gainesville they would just\ncome here to the hospital just right\nacross the hall and they would see a\nsonographer and and have an ultrasound\nand the physician could look in and see\nthat live and then have an interaction\nwith that patient there so it saved many\npeople like three hours commuting to to\nsee a physician\num\nthe I'm I'm keep I'm trying to be the\nsqueaky wheel to to keep that service\ngoing as well as to just to begin the\nneonatal uh the neonatal telemedicine I\njust think that's a great opportunity\nwith a nurse practitioner here in our\nNursery we could have a conference with\na neonatologist in Gainesville or\nanywhere and take care of a baby because\nit's not always that Hands-On that you\nneed you need the expertise on what to\ndo with the current situation what the\ncurrent condition and just you need\nguidance and that's where the\ntelemedicine can really be helpful\nforeign\nthank you very much I'm available\nafterwards to tell stories about the\nchairman when he was growing up\nthanks Dave\nall right next is uh\nDiane with uh the chief human resource\nofficer at Northeast Georgia Health\nSystem\nyeah come on up\nand thank y'all for hosting us today\nI'm sorry you want us to we're good okay\num we have a third member and it's Diane\nPoirot so uh I didn't want to butcher\nyour last name if you are an Agatha\nChristie fan and you like her kill poiro\nit's the same last name so uh either\npeople butchered or they were like are\nyou related to Hercule and I'm like uh\nthat's a fictional character so\nso no I'm not and I've got my colleagues\nhere Melissa and Nicholas and they'll\nintroduce themselves\num I have we got the Powerpoint ready\nand while she's pulling that up I just\nwant to say as you know Northeast\nGeorgia Health System has two rural\nhospitals Lumpkin and now Haversham and\nthey are very much critical to our\noverall plan for the area a lot of\npeople a lot of the healthcare\norganizations are looking at smaller\ncritical access hospitals so they can\nhave referral patterns for you know\nspecialty care that's really not part of\nwhat we are doing we already have about\n85 percent of the market in the\nGainesville area and we don't need more\nbusiness to come to Gainesville we just\nneed these services to be provided\ncloser to home and quite frankly we\nwouldn't be able to our emergency room\nis packed as you know we're always\npacked in the hospital we've already\ndone semis so we are we're doing two\nbeds in one room which is very unusual\nwe have not gone on diversion at all in\nthe last year or so again having the\nrural hospitals is critical to being\nable to serve our service area so we are\nvery about ensuring that hospitals like\nthese not only survive but Thrive I am\ngoing to talk a little bit about nursing\nand the state of nursing right now and a\nlittle bit about that do you need I do\nhave a\nokay I was gonna say I brought a thumb\ndrive Okay so\num I do like I'm prepared um I'll talk a\nlittle bit about the state of the\nworkforce right now in Georgia so you\nknow what we're what we're dealing with\nthen Melissa is going to talk about some\nof the initiatives that we've done at\nnghs and then my colleague Nicholas will\nfollow it up he's the director of\nphysician recruitment so he's going to\ntalk and elaborate more on what Dr\nHackett was speaking about and some of\nthe efforts there and I only wish we had\nbrought John Dalzell who was over our\ngme program I think you would love to\nhear from him so if you\nyou got it okay you can go to the next\none and so just to kind of look at\nGeorgia nursing by the numbers\num first of all there's one thousand one\nhundred and one thousand four hundred\nsixty five RNs and LPNs um currently\nemployed in the state of Georgia and\nonly a 1.2 percent nursing unemployment\nand that assumes that that 1.2 actually\nwants to work in nursing we've seen a\nlot of people that have left\num that have left the uh the profession\nespecially we saw an accelerated leaving\nof working for health care providers um\nduring covid because it was very very\ndifficult in 2010 there was 6914 nursing\njobs posted in the state of Georgia and\nthat's when we thought we had a crisis\nokay last year thirty four thousand five\nhundred and one's jobs posted nursing\njobs posted in the state of Georgia and\nof course we can't fill those so again\nassuming the 1.2 percent want to work\nthat's only about 1200 nurses it\ncertainly will not fill the 34\n000 and then over the next several years\nthe next decade Georgia schools predict\nto graduate 705 RNs and 228 LPNs but it\nstill will not fill the need just over\nthose next 10 years we'll be short 133\nRNs every year and we'll be sure short\n22 LPNs and that assumes LPNs are going\nto be not at the bedside what we've seen\nis LPNs were doing team-based nursing\nabout what 5 10 15 years ago you saw an\nexodus of LPNs from the bedside from the\nhospital going to our toward an RN model\nnow we're reestablishing team-based\nnursing but we just don't have the LPNs\nto be able to do that so a lot of what\nwe have are contract LPNs that are\ncoming in from outside the state which\nof course we're paying good money for I\nmean a lot of money for that a lot of\nmoney for that and but if that's what we\nneed to do to take care of our patients\nof course that's what we're going to do\nand then going to the next slide um\ntalking about the top five concerns so\nthis is the top five so it's not going\nto add up to 100 because it's the top\nfive so the market shortage of qualified\nRNs that's the nursing leaders top the\ntop one of the top five concerns again\nwe're not going to have we thought we\nhad a shortage now we know we have a\nshortage and we're working through that\na big one now is the abuse directed at\nnurses and I'll give you a little bit\nmore data on that but we see that I am\nreporting out on employee injuries\nalmost every day to leadership and I'm\nusually reporting out on physical\nassaults verbal assaults gesture\nassaults even sexual assaults increase\nin nursing labor costs and again we've\nseen that because of having to bring\nagency in agency typically if you were\npaying a nurse about 40 to 50 dollars\nagency would be maybe 65 to 75 dollars\nwe saw prices go as high as 225 dollars\nan hour during covid and we still have\nnot gotten down to pre-covered numbers\nso a lot of people they just want to\ntravel so that they can keep getting\nthat higher amount of money\num unresolved RN burnout we we know\nthere's physician burnout we're doing a\nlot for that but there's also RN burnout\nit's been really really difficult over\nthe last three years and so again\ngetting people the time off that they\nneed to go and take care of themselves\nit's really difficult when you don't\nhave the staff there that you need to\ntake care of the patient so we really\nhave to get quite creative with that\nwe've been trying uh different\nstrategies and not just to develop but\nfor um for Staffing and for scheduling\nand I'm happy to answer any questions\nabout that I can get real geeky about\nthat so I'll warn you that now\nagain I just talked to you about the\nacademic pipeline will not meet the\nprojected demand and that is not just\nfor nurses that is for Respiratory\ntherapists it's for Diagnostic Imaging\nit's for all the clinicians and Allied\nhealth professionals that are going to\nbe needed to take care of the patient\npopulation and then further nurses are\nworried about recruitment of the\nunlicensed Workforce too okay so if you\ndon't have somebody to clean that room\nif you're not if you don't have somebody\nto cook the food and pass the tray and\nright now because we saw unemployment go\nso low that's becoming really really\ndifficult to get people to take those\nfood nutrition services it used to be we\npaid more than than fast food and we\noffered benefits and everything well now\nfast food is doing you know 15 17 18 an\nhour and a lot a lot more flexible\nschedules and so again making sure that\nwe have that Staffing to cover the\nnon-licens is just as important\nand so um again I wanted to give you\nsome uh some data about workplace\nviolence because this is a Hot Topic\nright now in healthcare and it's a Hot\nTopic with the people that work for us\num this this comes from a premier\nWorkforce um survey that was done this\nyear February April and the percentage\nof Workforce directly involved in a\nworkplace violent violence incident in\nthe last two years 40 of the 669 people\nthat took the survey reported that they\nhad experienced a workplace violence\nevent and then you can see nurses got a\nlittle bit more of the brunt of it so\nout of that 669 people\num 43 we experience violence non-nursing\nbut 65 percent of the nursing in that\ngroup said they experience violence 47\nof the um all respondents said you know\nyes emotional verbal abuse 34 said yes\nit was nurses and then again 53 percent\nphysical or sexual abuse 66 percent of\nnurses felt that and there's a lot of\nreasons that I'm sure my nurse colleague\nhere could talk to you about there's\npatients that but you know they they may\nbe a correctional patient they may be a\nsocial patient that right now there's\nthere's not a place to put them and so\nnurses are still dealing with these\nfolks even though they may not need to\nbe in the hospital anymore\nand then I if you want to go ahead so\nthere was another data there um with\nprescany and press Gainey actually\nsurveys hospitals they don't survey all\nof them but out of the 483 Hospital\nSystems in their um in their database\nthey collected data for just three\nmonths of last year and over 5 000\nnurses in that time period had stated\nthat they were in some type of workplace\nviolence assault and again in this\nparticular one it was forcible unwanted\nphysical or sexual contact whether or\nnot there's intent to harm that's not\nbeing yelled at that's not you know\ngestures and we we look at all that\nbecause we consider all of that assault\nand so the question becomes is how can\nwe take all of these facts addressing\nour landscape in healthcare right now\nand really not just provide for the big\nhospitals but also the critical access\nhospitals and so forth because this\nstuff is happening everywhere and so we\nhave to be cognizant that the the nurses\nthat are coming into the workforce the\ndoctors that are coming into the\nworkforce the non-certified people\nthey're all worried about this and so\nwhat can we do to address this obviously\nwe can't just wait for nursing schools\nto submit more nurses or or we have to\nbe proactive and start doing some of\nthese things and so with that I'm going\nto turn this over to Melissa Rouse my\ncolleague and she's going to talk to you\nabout some of the things that we've done\nat Northeast Georgia to address this and\nagain these things will also impact\nrural hospitals\nI'm gonna just pause for just a second I\nthink Senator Patrick has uh just one\nthing I just wanted to point out is that\nwe had a study committee on violence\nagainst health care workers when we did\npass legislation on it this year yes so\nwe are doing something yeah and and let\nme say that I do appreciate it because\nwe did get to offer some feedback on\nthat legislation and I appreciate that\nthere were some things that might have\nbeen onerous to report and you listened\nto us and we really appreciated that we\nwant to take active steps to make sure\nwe're addressing workplace violence but\nnot necessarily\num\nmore reporting that that takes up\nresources and we want to be able to\nreport the app apt amount of report but\nwe don't want to be so onerous that it\ngets to be difficult to manage so really\nappreciate you taking our feedback on\nthat\nthank you so good afternoon I'm Melissa\nRouse I'm the executive director of\nnursing excellence and research so\nRecruitment and Retention has always\nbeen an issue right we've always been\nconcerned about that and I've always had\nplans on how we're going to meet the\nworkforce needs but more significantly\nover the last couple of years it has\njust grown and grown into those\nstatistics that Diane just shared so in\nearly 2022 our chief executive officer\nkind of called a group together and said\nhey we've got to have a plan like a\nreally strategic plan over these next\nfive years of how we're going to tackle\nthis and so we had multi-faceted plan\nrelated to that but one of the things\nthat I was tasked with was pipeline they\nsaid Melissa go be creative and figure\nout how you're going to do this and so I\nwent to my partner schools University of\nNorth Georgia is one of our partner\nuniversities we have come alongside them\nand have committed funding for the next\nfive years for them to create an\naccelerated BSN program so that's a\nprogram where if you have a bachelor's\ndegree you can become an RN in 15 months\nso it's like a second degree program to\nbecome a nurse and so we partnered with\nthem to hire faculty to get that program\nup and running and now are hoping to\nrecruit all of those folks into\nNortheast Georgia Health System I also\nmet with our technical colleges and and\nwe really put our thinking caps on\naround how can we get workforce out\nquicker and they had a summer program\nfor their CNAs it was an eight-week\nsummer program and that was the quickest\nroute to get a CNA and so I said what if\nwe offered that over and over and over\nthroughout the year could we do that\ncould we create a pipeline in that\nregard and so we started it it was a hit\nand we've been doing that since 2022.\num North Georgia Tech then said hey what\nabout us we want to do this too and so\nnow they're offering that eight-week\naccelerated CNA program and then North\nGeorgia Tech really has been a great\npartner in listening to where our needs\nare not only for nurses but also for\nLPNs and so we've got a a program\nrunning with both linear attack and\nNorth Georgia to get LPNs in a quick\nfashion in a one-year program they are\nready to come to work for us\nthen as you think about pipeline the\nLPNs are saying well what about us where\nis our career growth and so North\nGeorgia Tech recently you may be aware\nrecently got approved for a LPN to RN\nbridge program and so they'll soon be\naccepting their first class and that\nwill get us a nurse quicker so lots of\ncreative opportunities in really\npartnering with our schools to say how\ncan we help you help us to get this\npipeline moving and create nurses that\nwe can hire and then Bernal University\nwho sits right in our backyard in our\nGainesville Campus has really come\nforward and said what about us we want\nto be part of this too and so we're\nlooking at some Innovative programs\nright now to be able to partner with\nthem\nso um next slide please\nin looking at our pipeline we also kind\nof just got together and said okay any\nidea is a good idea let's just throw\nideas out there and let's just\nbrainstorm and as we were talking about\nthe competition of where people are\ngoing you know they're going to work in\nfast food and they're going to work in\nall of these other areas other than\nhealth care and we said what if we lower\nthe hiring age to 16.\nimagine that like people are like whoa\nwait a second six with 16 year olds\nrunning around the hospital that can't\nbe but we said no no we can do this we\ncan create a safe environment for them\nwe can train them to do the things that\nthey need to do and give them that\nentree into the Health Care system and\nso we do have a lowered hiring age now\nI'm excited to say we have a nice\ntraining program for 16 year olds you\nknow many of them if you have 16 year\nolds they need life skills\num and so we've done a really nice job\nof getting them into the health system\nin whatever capacity they're interested\nin and now they have career\nopportunities to grow with us at\nNortheast Georgia the advancement\nprograms that are listed there are the\nones that I spoke of a minute ago so\nthat PCT and LPN program we partner with\nlinear attack in North Georgia Tech\nthrough the generosity of our foundation\nas well as the funding that we have\nbudgeted through Northeast Georgia\nHealth System we are sending these folks\nto school we're paying for their tuition\ntheir books their uniforms their fees\neverything\nit's a game changer and it had just such\npowerful stories from these folks about\nhow this has changed their lives\num so in eight weeks they can become a\npatient care Tech they sign a contract\nto stay for two years with us and our\nhope is to continue them on the pipeline\nso we have the PCT advancement program\nfor a non-licensed person so if you work\nin our Hospital in dietary services or\nenvironmental services and you think you\nmight want to get into Health Care this\nis a program that can help you get that\nstart we also recruit from the outside\nso you know we didn't want to just be\nrobbing Peter to pay Paul from within we\nwant to bring new people into the\norganization and so we've hired folks\ninto these positions as well\nour LPN advancement program we require\nthat they have a CNA so that they can\nwork part-time while they're going to\nschool so same program where we pay\ntuition books fees everything and they\nwork part-time and then are paid a\nfull-time salary so that they're paid\nfor the time that they're studying and\ndoing clinicals and things of that sort\nso in one year we have an LPN out of\nthat program we just had our first one\ngraduate we're very excited and we have\nseven that just started this fall that\nwill be going through the program\nand then the next step of that is our\nPCT to RN program we're getting ready to\nlaunch that for the fall we're putting\nall of our publicity together right now\nto start recruiting for that so that\nprogram will be similar to the others\nand that will pay for all of those\nthings\num we're going to partner with our Tech\nschools because we can get an RN quicker\nso instead of going to a four-year\nprogram they'll they'll go through the\ntwo-year program and so linear attack\nand North Georgia Tech are very excited\nto partner with us in that and then the\nLPN to RN program that's the bridge\nprogram that was just approved at North\nGeorgia Tech so we have students\napplying for that right now so I'm very\nproud of those programs and then a\ncouple of other creative programs that\nwe have the compass PCT program is a\nprogram for nursing students who want to\ncome work in the hospital over the\nsummer so it's a 12-week program they\ncome in they get paid full-time hours\nand they function like a CNA or a\npatient care Tech and get real-life\nHospital experience we rotate them\nthrough the department so they can find\nDepartment that they're really\npassionate about whether it's the\nemergency department or oncology or\nPediatrics and then at the end of that\n12-week program we hope that they'll\nstay on PRN or per diem so that they can\ncontinue going to nursing school and\nthen we'll hire them into our Residency\nprogram on graduation\nand then the two new programs that we\nstarted this year that we're excited\nabout the PCT immersion program\nis a hybrid of that Compass PCT so this\nwas the fifth year running our Compass\nPCT program so we did this offshoot\nwhere you work for us for those 12 weeks\nbut you work two shifts each week as a\npatient care tag and one shift partnered\nwith an RN so now we're moving them into\nthe RN world they're in nursing school\nalready they have competencies they've\nbeen signed off on so they get to start\ngetting some of that real word world\npractice and we rotate them through\ndepartments as well so it's that same\nopportunity to really find their passion\nand the unit that they want to be hired\ninto\nand then in partnership with University\nof North Georgia we started a Nurse\nextern Program actually I'm sorry let me\nback up to the PCT immersion that's the\npartnership with the University of North\nGeorgia so while they're in the RN role\npartnered with an RN they're getting\nschool credit for that so it's a really\nnice opportunity for them to continue\ngetting credits for school over the\nsummer time while they're here getting\nall of that experience as well Bernal is\nvery excited about partnering with us\nfor that for next year so I'm hoping to\ntake that on the road and get more\nschools involved in doing that the nurse\nextern program is a program where we are\ntaking nursing students we'll bring them\nin in the summer as well as in the\nChristmas break time frame that winter\nbreak so that they can spend an extended\nperiod of time with us to get oriented\nand then their commitment will be one\nshift every other week so that they can\nstay connected to us while they finish\nnursing school and then hopefully hire\ninto our nurse Residency program so all\ndifferent opportunities not one size\nfits all but lots lots of different\nopportunities for people to get into our\nhealth system find out who we are and\nreally become acclimated to the\nNortheast Georgia Health System and find\ntheir career path did you want to add\njust want to first of all commend my\ncolleague here because she's really been\ninvolved in a lot of these programs and\nwe can but I do want to give one little\num so you're going to ask does do these\nwork\nand so I will tell you I I've only been\nhere for a year we had 9456 employees\nlast year we have over 11 000 employees\nnow this year now 400 of those are came\nfrom Haversham but we are still a\nthousand employees to the good we have\nreduced our our contract labor by half\nfrom 157 million to about 70 million so\nagain these programs are working and\nkudos to first of all Northeast Georgia\nHealth System for funding some also our\nauxiliary for funding some our\nfoundation for funding some but these\nare great programs that are already\ntried and true and if there's any\nfunding out there that would be great\nabsolutely I will say that we just put\nour budget together for fiscal year 24\nand I had to figure out where do I want\nto invest in these programs where is\nwhere are we going to get the most bang\nfor our buck which of course is the RN\nprograms right because that's where our\ngreatest need is but it's hard to make\nthose decisions and so I applied for a\nDepartment of Labor Grant didn't get it\nbut we'll try again and we'll try to\nfind more funding it was Federal a\nfederal department of labor Grant to\npartner with all these schools let me\nstop and ask you about the RN program\nthat you're referring to was is it just\nthe PCT to RN or the LPN to RN which\nwhich one of those is is most successful\ndo you think so we haven't started those\nyet those are starting this fall\num the patient care to RN is a two-year\nprogram so that would be a quick way to\nget a registered nurse the LPN to RN is\na 17-month program so they're already a\nlicensed practical nurse they just need\nto get the registered nurse education so\n17 months we'll have that one so trying\nto figure out you know which which one\ndo we want to put our most the most\neffort into to try to get an RN as\nquickly as possible one of the things\nthat Diane mentioned do you have a\nquestion Senator Kirkpatrick I just um\nso I'm sitting here thinking about I\ncouldn't get 16 year olds out of my head\nbut but I was thinking about so we're\nwe're pushing people through these\nprograms so we can have bodies on the\nfloor to take care of the pay patients\nwhat do you have ongoing to continue\ntheir education because they're going to\nbe green when they come out how are you\nsetting up for mentorship and for\nongoing education because that\nexperience is uh you know that's what\ncauses burnout but it also is the people\nthat you want taking care of you if\nyou're a patient so how are you Humanity\nthank you for asking I couldn't plan\nthat better so we started an LPN\nResidency program so for these folks\nthat are coming out as LPNs we we've had\na registered nurse Residency program\nwhich is a one-year program to really\nsupport them transition to practice we\nstarted one for our LPNs and so we're\nheavily recruiting new grad LPNs into\nour organization right now and\nsupporting them that way those that go\nthrough these programs have a connection\nwith the coordinators that will continue\nto support them so they're out rounding\non the units while they're through\norientation and then we want to move\nthem through all of these career\nPathways so continuous development we\nhave Under My Umbrella we have all the\nthe nursing education and so we do an\nannual needs assessment survey with our\nstaff to see what are you interest\ninterested in you know what classes do\nyou want we have very generous programs\nto be able to send people to conferences\nto give them all kinds of upskilling so\nthat's definitely on our mind is to make\nsure that not only do we get them out\nthe door and out taking care of patients\nbut that we continue to give them\ndevelopment opportunities yeah really\ngreat question the last thing that I'll\ntouch on on that side is work based\nlearning and so as we were thinking\nabout our 16 year olds that we needed to\nget into the health system I was invited\nto a middle school fair and I went out\nand talked to them and in middle school\nas you guys know in the state of Georgia\nthey're declaring this pathway that they\nwant and so I had all of these kids that\nthought they might be interested in a\nhealthcare career and when I went I went\nwith the idea of recruiting for\nNortheast Georgia overall not everyone\nwants to be a nurse but if you're in I.T\nyou know if you like techy things we've\ngot I.T positions if you want to be an\nengineer come work for facilities if you\nwant to be in Food Service come work for\nour dietary so really talking to them\nabout all the opportunities that we have\nin our health system and so we created a\nWorkforce Development coordinator\nposition so our leadership said okay I\nsee where you're going with this let's\nsee what this looks like and so we've\nhired this person and she goes out to\nthe middle school she goes out to the\nhigh schools she's recruiting for all of\nour positions not just nursing all\npositions and linking these folks into\nour organization we bring them in they\ndo rotations through different\ndepartments we take our simulation bus\nout and get them exposed to things in\nhealth care so that has really created a\nlot of energy and excitement for folks\nto come into the healthcare setting we\nhave hired many of the patients or the\nstudents from work based learning so\nthey've come in in high school and then\nwe've hired them into positions because\nremember we hire at 16 so it's the\nperfect way\nit's a perfect way to get them in\num I will say too that you know we have\nso many great opportunities for high\nschool students right now to go to a CNA\nprogram while they're in high school and\nso they're finishing and and they are\nCNAs in their Junior and senior years of\nhigh school but they didn't have\nopportunities to go work in a health\nsystem so we said let's do flexible\nschedules let's take them for whatever\nhours they'll give us so we have four\nhours six hours and eight hour shifts\nthat we can bring these kids into if\nthey work after school or if they can\nonly work on the weekends you know some\nof them have modified schedules so we've\nreally had to get creative around how we\ncreate opportunities to recruit folks\ninto our organization so those are the\nprograms that we have going right now\nthey are just hitting the tip of the of\nthe the spear in in what we need of\ncourse but at least you know we're\ngetting some momentum and getting things\nmoving if you can move to the next slide\num this is just a little bit about\nretaining our employees and some some of\nthe things we've talked about Senator\nKirkpatrick asked about those career\nPathways we have a lot of leadership\ninitiatives about connecting with your\nemployees and making sure that they are\nhappy that they're adjusting that it's a\nright fit for them you know having those\n30-day 60-day 90-day check-ins and then\nthose monthly or quarterly check-ins to\nsee where our employees are and we're\nhaving conversations with them about how\ndo I help you get to that next step what\nis it that you want in your career path\nand how can we find that for you in\nNortheast Georgia\npay Diane talked about pay a bit we've\ncome up with some creative programs for\npeople to work PRN or per DM and so we\nhave four levels now so they can pick\nthe level that they want to work at\nbased on how much commitment they want\nto give us for hours and the pay\nincreases with the amount of commitment\nso again flexible way to really help\npeople with work-life balance to really\nmeet the needs of their families\nhour increases yes foreign\nyes exactly so let's say you commit to\nthree shifts of pay period you make a\ncertain dollar amount but if you if you\nagree to six shifts per pay period you\nmake more money and if you agree to\neight shifts for pay period you make\neven more money and then 12 shifts so it\ngoes up as as the different levels go up\nso that's appealing for people you know\nif you've got kids in school and you\ncan't work a full-time schedule but you\nyou still want to commit to the\norganization\nand then that first dot Point uh Crisis\nPrevention Institute you know Diane\ntalked a bit about the the violence that\nour employees are facing we are our\nstaff has said we don't feel safe we\nneed things put into place to make us\nfeel safe and so we've offered this\nCrisis Prevention Institute we put\nalmost a thousand employees through that\nlast year and we're on target to bring\n500 through this year\num they've asked for increased security\nand so we're trying to increase security\npresence we've put some things into\nplace around\num a a badge that you can push a button\non for a panic button and it's got some\nrtls so we can find you you know\nsecurity knows where you are in the\nbuilding so lots of things being put\ninto place to help increase the\nworkplace safety\nnext slide\nthis is the voluntary turnovers all the\nwork that we've been doing around\nPipeline and retention really it's a\nconstant cycle right so if you're short\nstaffed it's hard to keep your staff\nbecause they're exhausted and so they\nleave but as you hire more staff you get\nhappier staff because they have peers\nthey have people there with them and so\nit's all interrelated and so this is our\nvoluntary turnover you can see that the\nnational Benchmark is 18.8 percent we\nstarted at 16 and we really were not\nhappy with that and have worked very\nhard to get it down to 12.9 turnover for\na full-time and part-time staff that's\noverall staff in the organization and\nthen the next slide is our nursing\nturnover so as we're talking about our\nnursing staff you can see the Benchmark\nat the top there is 18.2 we were at 16\nin October of 22 and we are now at 11.3\nso we've really done a lot of work to\num to recruit and retain thank you it's\nbeen a a yeoman's effort for sure lots\nof good work around that yes it is and\nand I think it's just proof that these\nprograms speak volumes right and so even\nif we're only putting\nseven people through LPN school everyone\nsees that and they're like wow they're\ntrying they're trying to do things to\nhelp be creative and and create some new\nprocesses for us to get staff in here\nand then my final slide this next slide\nis just some opportunities you know I\nwas thinking about what what can the\nstate do to help what are some ideas to\nreally help support the programs that\nwe're starting and the programs that we\nneed to continue with increasing that\nworkplace safety is at the top because\nthat is first and foremost what we hear\nfrom our staff I know a lot of work has\nbeen done and thank you for that around\nprotecting the identity of the injured\nyou know staff is sometimes hesitant to\nfile that police report because it's\npublic record right and that bad guy can\nfind your your address and and come to\nyour house and so we've heard stories of\nthose types of things and so staff it\ngoes around and people talk right and so\nthen they're afraid harsher penalties\nare certainly something that our staff\nis asking for and then funding for\nincrease security you know just like\nevery Department Security is challenged\nas well and so we need to make that\nenticing so that security officers want\nto come work in the health system to be\nthere to help protect our staff and then\nways to attract to the Northeast Georgia\nregion you know to Georgia overall but\ncertainly to the Northeast Georgia\nregion where our hospitals are you know\nincentivizing and I think Dr Hatchett\nspoke to some of these things so it's\nnice to see the same themes right so\nstudent loan payback whether they go to\nschool here or we recruit them in from\noutside being able to help pay those\nloans back state tax incentives I have\nlived in California Florida Texas and\nnow here and my husband is a retired\nveteran and a disabled veteran and so\nstate taxes are something that are quite\nappealing As you move from state to\nstate and benefits around things like\nthe toll road any of those types of\nthings that make a difference in that\nmonthly income car registration breaks\nare an idea you know housing incentives\nI think just anything that makes it more\nappealing to come to this area\nand then I think Dr Hatchet touched on\num just really selling the beauty of\nGeorgia I I've been here for almost two\nyears I did not know where Gainesville\nGeorgia was when I was recruited out\nhere but I said let's go check it out\nand I got here and I was just in love I\nabsolutely love this it's my favorite\nplace that we've ever lived and my\nhusband has started a business here and\nwe are planted and so we are committed\nto making this the best place possible\nand bringing as many people as we can\nhere I'm recruiting like crazy\nthank you Melissa my name is Nicholas\nBenton the director of physician\nrecruitment for Northeast Georgia\nPhysicians Group and Georgia Heart\nInstitute so both of the two employed\nmedical groups at Northeast Georgia and\nI wanted to\num I guess build on surgical recruitment\nI know that that was a focus of this\ncommittee and so I kind of wanted to\ndouble click on some of the challenges\nwhat the landscape looks like as we go\nout to recruit a surgeon keeping in mind\nthat we're recruiting on a national\nstage when we're recruiting a surgeon\nwe're not recruiting locally so I pulled\nsome data from the American College of\nSurgeons and per capita supply of U.S\ngeneral surgeons declined 18\nfrom 6.4 per 100\n000 population to 5.2 100 000 population\nbetween 2020 excuse me 2001 and 2019.\nrural areas declined 29.1 percent and\nsmall and isolated rural communities\ndeclined 32.6 percent so that's very\ndramatic as it affects rural communities\nin addition 48.8 percent of urban\ngeneral surgeons are over 50 years of\nage compared to 55 percent in large\nrural areas and 59 percent in small\nrural areas\nin 2019 60.1 of non-metropolitan\ncounties have no active general surgeon\napproximately a thousand general\nsurgeons graduate each year\nless than 20 percent of those actually\ngo into general surgery most of them go\non to do fellowships to do something\nmore specialized\nand an estimated of the 20 that go into\ngeneral surgery about 12 graduates a\nyear end up in rule in a rural setting\nnationally we're talking about the\nnational stage and to give you an idea\nof the number of openings for those 12\ngraduates they're 1700 job openings\nenroll the rural U.S\nso that's um just wanted to kind of\npaint a little bit of a picture of what\nwe're working with when we're talking\nabout recruitment of a general surgeon\nand this is not unique to General\nSurgery I'm just highlighting this\nparticular specialty and\nnext slide please\nso a little bit to build on kind of what\nDr Hatchet had mentioned thank you Dr\nHatchett how we recruit to rural\ncommunities and the things that my team\nfocuses on and the um incentives that we\ntry to promote that are available to us\nso one of the things is we try to\nutilize the rural Health Care\ninitiatives to include both the state\nloan repayment plan the lrp and we also\nfocus in on the J-1 waiver program\nas in addition to that we incentivize\nour physicians through signing bonuses\nloan repayments I think Dr Hatchett had\nmentioned sometimes if we have someone\nthat's interested in practicing and\nthey're going into a fellowship and\nthey're from Habersham let's say we'll\ngo ahead and sign them really early and\nwe'll provide them an income stipend\nwhile in Fellowship to go ahead and get\nthem to make a commitment\nso it's just some unique things that we\ntry to help lock in those Physicians\nthat want to come back and practice and\nRule areas\nwe also really focus on the positive so\nsome of the things that Dr Hatchet had\nmentioned the lower cost of living the\nidea of the hometown hero so he's at the\nWalmart he everyone recognizes him\neveryone's asking him questions these\nPhysicians are very valued in the\ncommunity and then that is really\nsomething that is something that we try\nto sell right you're going to make a\nhuge impact you're not going to be one\nof 500 Physicians you're going to be one\nof a very small community\nin addition to that we also highlight\nyour professional Independence a lot of\ntimes as a general surgeon you can\npractice a more full scope versus if\nyou're in a large metropolitan area\nyou're going to be very limited you're\ngoing to be doing very limited\nprocedures whereas in\nsome rural areas you can practice a more\nfull scope\num obviously highlighting it's a great\nplace to raise a family and then of\ncourse the excuse me\nI need some water yeah the Abundant\nrecreational activities\num\nanother really important piece is the\ncurrent physician involvement\nthank you sorry\nmm-hmm\npeople are already so the people that\nare already here so there's nothing more\ndifficult than recruiting your first\nphysician to a community\num so if you do have a medical community\nwe try to make those connections a lot\nof times we're making connections with\nboard members with local government the\nmayor sometimes I mean I've recruited in\nsome really rural areas where we are\nhosting physician dinners at the mayor's\nhouse or at a physician's house because\nwe may not always have\num you know a lot of places to take\nsomeone out to meet colleagues and\nthings like that which is a part of that\nwhole onboarding and recruitment process\nkeeping in mind we're also recruiting\nthe family it's not all about the\nsurgeon we're recruiting the spouse and\nthe family so we've got to talk about\nschools we've got to talk about cost of\nliving we've got to talk about housing\nwe've got to really focus on a lot of\ndifferent aspects to that physician to\nsell the position and this is not a lot\ndifferent than what we do in more of our\nUrban environments but we just have to\nfocus a lot more on the community and\nall the attributes that are available to\nthose Physicians within rural practices\nthe next slide\nso some of the things that my department\nutilizes as I've mentioned previously is\nthe state loan repayment programs\nso these are not without limitations and\nwhere I thought that we could\npotentially talk about some\nopportunities where we could have\npotentially some expansion or or\notherwise but one of the first one is\nthe Physicians for Rural Aries\nassistance program this is a loan\nrepayment program that is available and\nI can offer this as an option there's a\nvery limited window that you can apply\nfor this\nbut it's available I think it depends on\nthe funding and I think from the website\nit was under 35 at least was what was\nlast reported and that number may not be\ncompletely accurate but I did pull it\nfrom the State website I think the last\ntime it was updated was 2017 so that\nnumber may be a little bit more or less\num in addition to that not only is that\nnot a lot for the whole entire state of\nGeorgia but in addition to that we do\nhave the Georgia physician loan\nrepayment program but it's limited to\nthose Specialties in Family Medicine\nInternal Medicine Pediatrics OB GYN\ngeriatrics and Psychiatry all of those\nare considered your primary care\npractices and a lot of the programs that\nwe have are focused around primary care\nand Primary Care is extremely important\nbut equally as important as some of the\nsub-specialties and surgeons that would\nnot be eligible for that particular\nprogram so in thinking about that having\nan expansion of the types of individuals\nthat could apply for that loan repayment\nprogram could be a nice incentive when\nwe talk about attracting Physicians to\nrural communities\nthe other area that we deal with is\nrelated to the J-1 waiver program as\nGeorgia has two or at least what's\navailable to me within the Northeast\nregion are two programs for J1 waivers\nthe first is the Conrad 30 that's the\nnational program Georgia has adopted the\nnational program and that basically\ngrants 30 waivers in the entire state of\nGeorgia each year for Physicians\npracticing again in Primary Care\num\nexcuse me primary care and the rural\nenvironment Urban environment and\nSpecialists but they're prioritized\nthere's only 30 of those waivers that go\naround the application opens up in the\nfall it's usually closed very rapidly\nlike within days because obviously it's\na very popular program where we're\ntrying to bring in International Medical\ngraduates into rural environments to\nhelp them plant roots and establish\nrelationships it's just a pathway it's\nnot our only pathway but it is a pathway\nbut the way that this program is\nprioritized is that it all goes it's\nfocused around primary care and Rural\nenvironments so it's prioritized for\nrule first then primary care for the\nurban environment and then potentially\nSpecialists if there's anything left\nover but there's only 30. so a lot of\ntimes those get used up the other\nprogram that we do have available in\nthis area is the Appalachian Regional\nCommission or the art program and that\nopens up the additional ability for us\nto bring J1 candidates into rural\nmarkets but again it's very it's very\nspecific and focused around Family\nPractice General Pediatrics obstetrics\ninternal medicine and Psychiatry so\nthose Primary Care practices there is a\npathway within that program that you can\napply for a waiver but it's an extra\nStep Beyond what's what the program was\ndesigned for and so each of those\nprograms although very important and we\ndo utilize those and we do sell them\nhave their limitations as it relates to\nspecialist and general surgery\nthe next slide I know it's kind of small\nbut I just wanted to show highlight on\n3rnet annual report over last year how\nthat really plays out when we're looking\nat the J1 waiver program this is not a\nreflection of the entire U.S but the\n3rnet as I understand it partners with a\ntremendous amount of healthcare\norganizations in rural uh in the U.S\nacross the U.S so under their program\nthere was\n397 J-1 placements\nand of those seven were for general\nsurgery\nand then for physician Replacements\num just position placements within so\nthis sorry I should back up a little bit\nthe 3rn app helps Place Physicians that\nhave a job board they have resources\nthat they provide to all Physicians\nlooking for a work and rule in rural\nareas\nbut of that they only place 14 general\nsurgeons within the rural areas of those\n397 only seven of those were available\nthrough the J-1 program\nI will double click a little bit on the\nJ-1 program in that it'll it basically\nallows the physician to have ties and a\ncommitment to the rural area for\napproximately at least five years and\nwe're thinking by that point they'll\nhave established roots that will have\nmade community community connections and\nwill want to stay within that community\nand so that's just one of the pathways\nthat we're utilizing I don't want to\nstop you because this is a lot of really\ngood information but we're running short\non time because we have the three\no'clock but I was going to see if we\ncould get a copy of your presentation\nabsolutely\num and just thank you all once again for\nhosting\nyeah let's let's let okay\nyeah just uh I used to run a big\nOrthopedic Group and one of the trends\nthat we saw with the Millennials and\nbelow is that they look at life a\ndifferent way and when they're in\nmedical training they tend to specialize\nand narrow their focus and they so we'd\nrecruit an orthopedic surgeon he would\nonly want to do spine or would only want\nto do fill in the blank so they care\nmore about quality of life and how many\nnights they're on ER call than they do\nabout anything else so I think the\ntrauma angle might be worth exploring\nfor general surgery connecting with a\ntrauma Commission on that that might be\na good selling point because you're\nfighting these societal trends that I\ndon't have an answer for but I think\nyour brainstorming needs to take that\ninto account not questions\nanyone else\nwell there's so much to react to the\nthat and our time is limited so I know\nwe try to fit a lot into one meeting and\nwe really appreciate it\ninformation and great Innovative\napproaches I mean I\nwell thank you all very much\nnext we have Lisa jellum\ndean of Atrium Health Floyds school of\nhealth sciences at Georgia Highlands\nCollege\nthank you for hanging in there with us\nthroughout the whole day\nyou know I'm in education so I'm\nslightly worried you guys are going to\nsay that I plagiarized my entire thing\nbut we know that it came out yesterday\nbut I Echo the room\nand I'm done right\nbut so all right\nokay so I'll go ahead and introduce\nmyself I'm Dr Lisa jellum I am the dean\nof Atrium Health Floyd school of health\nsciences I serve out of Georgia\nHighlands College in Rome Georgia so\nwe've alluded to you know that rural\nWorkforce kind of coming to fruition I\nget to see before my eyes I've been\nthere now for 16 years so I've grown up\nin in rural education I am going to tell\nyou I am a product of Georgia\nrecruitment I came from Gillette Wyoming\nprobably one of the smallest places on\nEarth\num\nin efforts to get my doctoral degree a\nterminal degree in education and I came\nhere specifically because of the tuition\nassistance program that Georgia offers\nso these programs do work and so you\nknow I've had a lot of uh you know we'll\ncall it the rubber meeting the road as\nfar as Education and Leadership and\nseeing some of these programs actually\ncreate you know people that are going to\nroot within Georgia\nso today I'm wearing multiple hats I\nactually am the vice president of the\nGeorgia Association of nursing Deans and\ndirectors and so because of that the\nGeorgia nursing leadership Coalition is\na collaborative effort of just in insert\nall of the acronyms you see up there if\nyou need any of those to to tease apart\nI can help you and it's really just a\njoint effort of all of these nursing\nplaces so we are really trying to take\nthose silos and really break those down\nbecause when I first became Dean I\nthought it was innate to take all of the\ncommunity involvement and get out into\nthe community I took a hundred meetings\noutside of my office and my first six\nmonths of taking Dean ship because I\nfelt like you know that's the way you do\nthings where I come from in Wyoming you\ngo and look people in the eyes and you\nshake their hands and you ask them you\nknow what is it that we're doing right\nand what is it that we're doing wrong\nand don't worry I can take the criticism\nand I'm going to take that back and so I\nwas really really excited to be a part\nof some kind of Coalition like this\nto start to actually unify the front\nbetween all of us just redundantly for\nyou know seven or eight hours telling\nyou the exact same thing over and over\nagain\nso I'm going to give you a little bit of\nthe background of you know where Georgia\nnursing is by the numbers I know in my\nprevious uh the previous slides was\nlooking at those that are employed I\nwould like to bring your attention to\nabout a 40 000 person disparity between\nactive licensure and those that are\nactually employed in the state of\nGeorgia so we do see about 1 169 000\nactive licenses between the LPN and RN\ncommunities\nand what's really important for you to\nknow is in the next slide\nwhen you're looking at capturing those\nthat are employed in RN settings about\n60 percent a little uh closer to\ntwo-thirds are looking at some form of\nhospital setting so when you're looking\nat the shortage and the effect of which\nthe RN specific shortage is going to\naffect the most you are seeing the\nhospitals specifically in the rural\nareas\nso if you needed more slides to you know\nhelp you look at whether or not this\nshortage actually occurs we have 2010 in\ncomparison to 2021 and so you can see\nthat the RN job postings over time have\nexponentially grown in the state of\nGeorgia in the last 12 years I know that\nthat's not a secret to you but in the\nnext slide I think that you can paint a\nbetter picture of where you're truly\nseeing the disparity so in the previous\nslide you saw the Metropolitan um\nuh location expressed which took you\nknow 28 000 of those job postings so it\nlooks really large as far as the job\npostings but when you tease out the\nmetropolitan area and you're only\nlooking at the Central Northeast\nNorthwest Southwest and in southeast\nyou're going to see where the disparity\ntruly lies and so when you're looking at\nwhat the effect is in rural Georgia when\nan RN isn't at the bedside that kind of\nrolls down the hill and so I'm coming\nfrom an education perspective of you\nknow in nursing education we are seeing\nthis just as much as they do at the\nbedside when a Dean is taking out the\ntrash and you have your RN you know\neducator is doing something besides\neducating RNs you end up with\ndisparities like this because if I can't\nfit that Workforce demand you know\nyou're going to see a shortage over time\nand so we are now seeing what we thought\nwe were going to see about 10 years ago\nwhen I started this conversation in the\nHealth Sciences that we are eventually\ngoing to see nursing education come to a\nbig disparity in creating nursing\nlicensure and sure enough we're here\nso there's a couple causes of the\nshortage in rural nurses one of which\nyou know and I'm speaking in the behalf\nof what I would call a geographically\num\nunique area because people that are\ngetting licenses in Northwest Georgia\ncan easily commute to the metropolitan\narea and if you're looking at the\ndisparity between Northwest Georgia and\nthe Metropolitan wage Gap a little over\nten thousand dollars if you're talking a\nbrand new graduate you know graduating\nin Rome Georgia easily can take an hour\ncommute to hit the metropolitan area and\ntake that ten thousand dollar Gap so\nthat's already causing a geographical\nproblem for that shortage if there's\nalso a real lack of incentive to keep\nour nurses in the rural areas and so\nwhen I first became Dean I would tell\nyou that we had a lot of we'll call them\nclinical Partners we were putting them\neverywhere and I am a I am not a nurse I\nam a teacher education major by trade\nand I'm going to tell you where I\nstudent taught I would have given my\nleft arm to be employed because I knew\nwho the janitor was I knew where to you\nknow get the food I knew if I parked in\nthe wrong spot that you know Johnny that\nwas going to drive by would give me the\nhead nod and I could move my car\nour nurses and our Hospital workers work\nthe same way so where they're at and\nwhere we're immersing them in it matters\nbecause if I'm immersing 90 of my\nclinical hours in a rural area you're\ngoing to see our students have less\narousal levels when you're getting as\nfar as into an actual profession and\nthat's leading to some of the burnout\nand so I don't have specific data\nleading me towards that up but I'm going\nto tell you anecdotally when my nursing\nstudents look calm and then they get\nnursing licenses and they're employed in\nthese hospitals you're going to see less\nrates of burnout because they don't go\nfrantically into the workforce worried\nabout the things that you and I you know\nas working adults we don't worry about\nparking spots and little things that my\nnursing students are worried about\nbecause because that's one of the you\nknow what we'll call barriers for\nsuccess\nso in our recommendations for the\nGeorgia\nnursing leadership Coalition is\na page student loan forgiveness so\nforgive portioning of the nursing\nstudent debt if they commit to live and\nwork in rural Georgia that's one way\nthat we can incentivize our students for\nstaying out in the rural areas I don't\nthink that needs to be long-term a\nlong-term commitment as you said I think\nit could be an upfront cost and I'm\ngoing to tell you that I'm going to\npiggyback upon that recommendation and\nto tell you that\nI serve a community that is 44 at\nGeorgia Highlands Pell Grant\num\nthat's a big deal because you're talking\nI get a phone call once a month from a\nstudent that's telling me I'm going to\nquit nursing school because of a 50 bill\nand so I'm always like wait a second\nlike how much are we talking here you\nknow is it hundreds of thousands we're\ntalking 60 bucks and so last year we\nsaved a student with a 300 bill that was\njust very very confidently telling me\nit's okay Dr jellum I'm gonna go ahead\nand pause my nursing career I'll come\nback next spring one full calendar year\nthey're going to pause their career\nbecause of a 300 Bill and so it's not\njust the loan forgiveness at the end\nthat is going to capture some of our\nrural health care workers it's in time\nfunding it's access to funding that is\non top of the Pell grant that is on top\nof the student loan that can incentivize\nthe worker to stay there\non top of at the end possibly doing some\nform of forgiveness\nfor on the education side you know if\nyou're looking at ways for me to pass\nthrough funding tax incentives for our\npre-licensure to have some ability to\nhave the um we won't call them\npreceptorship but having my clinical\nrotations have some form of tax\nincentive for those clinical\npractitioners to take on my clinicals so\nwe have this argument I would say once a\nmonth in the Georgia Association of\nnursing Deans and directors of what is\nyour capacity so if I look around the\nroom and I say you know what is your\ncapacity and I'm talking South Georgia\nthey're going to say it is I do not have\ncapacity based on clinical placements\nyou move to the next school and they're\ngoing to tell you its physical capacity\nyou move to the next school they're\ngoing to tell you it's nursing Educators\nin fact they'll all tell you it's\nnursing Educators let's not we'll go\nthat's a standard answer\nbut when you look at true capacity there\nis 19 to 20 different Dynamic\npossibilities that I have to take into\nplace before I say my capacity is 400 in\nthe program at Georgia Highlands because\nI am responsible for getting 400\nstudents from the start to the end and I\ndon't want it to get halfway through and\nme decide well there are no clinical\nplacements for 200 students and I have\nto tell these students to move to a\ndifferent place so there's a lot riding\non me falling on the capacity number\nso when you talk\num ways for me to pass through funding\nand open up actual capacity in nursing\neducation we have talked about investing\nin a structured nurse Residency program\nso when you're talking investing into\nthe hospital I think that's one of the\nbest recommendations that you know the\nnursing Coalition has come up with\nbecause not only are the nurse residency\nprograms showed higher retention rates\nwe know that the clinical confidence is\nsignificantly higher we see a decrease\nin Burnout in improved patient outcomes\nbut you're also going to see in the next\nslide that we also ask that there is\nsome form of an incentive for exactly\nwhat the previous presenters said and so\nwhen these collaborative Partnerships\nbetween the schools of Nursing and\nhealth care providers are in place\nyou're going to see that this is a\nreciprocity agreement between the\neducational institution and the hospital\nitself and a lot of these things you are\ngoing to see will instantaneously\nincrease the probability that that\nperson Works within that hospital system\nand so when that investment is made\nthat it also comes with some risk and so\nin the next slide\nthe reason they asked me to talk is that\nI have recently become the atrium Health\nFloyd school of health sciences that\ninvestment was made over the next five\nyears it's a multi-year partnership that\nAtrium Health Floyd and Georgia\nHighlands went into to increase my\nnursing capacity\num 50 and so last year I was at a\ncapacity of about 200 percent in 2028 I\nshould be at 300 on paper\nand I'm going to tell you that it came\nwith a multi-pronged of benefits and\nlike I said I serve a population of\npeople that Georgia Highlands was well\nknown as an access institution a\ntwo-year Institution for many many years\nour first uh we'll call it run at a\nbaccalaureate degree was the RN to BSN\nit's highly popular it's a very very\nprominent program and it was one way for\nus to capture all of those RNs that we\nhad created at the two-year degree\nprogram and get them into four-year\nBaccalaureate programs right there in\nRome while they're working and that has\nbecome very fruitful for us\ngive you a little bit of glance of why\nit is that the hospital program picks\nsomebody like me I have a thousand\nstudents right now that are\npre-professional in our Health\nProfessions associate degree which means\nto me that all 1000 of those students\nare prospective nursing students and\nthat means to the hospital that there\nare a thousand students in the pipeline\nthat could become nurses\nthere's a caveat to this though is\neverything that we've said about health\nand all of the things you can't take\ninto account all of the things that\nstudents and adult Learners in life will\nbring to the table\nand so because of that creativity is\ngoing to be our best friend for the next\nfive to seven years in actually\nperforming a Workforce pipeline surgery\nper se because we have three what I'll\ncall bottlenecks number one is at the\nCollege and Career Academy at the high\nschool level getting those students into\nproper courses in the dual enrollment\npathway that lead to quicker access to\nnursing that's one of the bigger things\nthat we have worked in recruitment of\nthe K-12 is making sure that those\nstudents are actually taking Anatomy 1\nAnatomy 2 micro courses that are leading\ntowards actual admission into the\nnursing program the CNA and the\nphlebotomy all the things are super\ngreat because our students can work as\nthey go to school that's super important\nfor an access institution but I'm going\nto tell you that if a student takes\nbiology 1010 or chemistry 10-12 at the\ncollege level that puts them six months\nahead of any other applicant at Georgia\nHighlands currently to get into the\nnursing program so it advising becomes\nreally important the other thing is that\nthe creation of the back the\nbaccalaureate degree in Health Sciences\nhas become what we thought was going to\nbe kind of the bullpen for nurses who\ndidn't get into our highly competitive\nprogram they could stay they would gain\ncredits towards their BSN so no time is\nlost no you know hope is wasted no\ntuition none of that it's all a really\ngood thing and they on attempt two then\ncan get into the nursing program\nwe thought this is the third year of our\nBachelor of Health Science we thought 60\nby now would be great as of this morning\nI have 298 students in The Bachelor of\nScience and health science\nit is awesome because it's not just\nnurses it has now become I raise my hand\nI want to be a PA I want to be a doctor\nI want to be a this I want to be a that\nand we are now creating a very\naffordable offer in Northwest Georgia\nfor students to not take on heavy\nstudent loan payments we've created\nrelationships with the Medical College\nof Georgia I serve on their Advisory\nBoard getting our Bachelor of health\nscience students into things like Grand\nrounds and things right there where\nthose students don't have to you know be\ncompletely online they can come and do\nthe things that a typical student we've\nhad high success rates of getting into\nmedical school and so that is something\nthat Georgia Highlands was very very and\nthe university system was very very\nsmart in creation to make sure that\nthose students had a way to not just\nonboard into nursing but also offward if\nsomething was to go wrong\nso because of that Atrium Health Floyd\nrecognized all of the Innovative things\nthat we've been doing we have an LPN to\nRN bridge program we have our RN program\nthat has 52 years of proof of concept\nand so they are offering every student\nin our um\nin our nursing program so my line of\nresearch comes in open educational\nresearch or resources so that's just a\nfancy way to say free textbooks and so\nmy dissertation was written on what\nwould happen if you took a free textbook\nand you insert it into about 1200\nstudents and what we found was that\nunder represented bodies of people\nspecifically at access institutions\nwould score higher than those that did\nnot and you can think of all the logical\nreasons they have access to stuff on day\none they don't have to wait for their\nstudent loans to hit\nand the withdrawal withdrawal rate\nspecifically for those that are over 25\ndrop by 50 percent and why I'm saying\nthat that's so important is my average\nnursing student is 24.5 and so one of\nthe things I went to the hospital to say\nis my nursing textbook book group thing\nis very expensive and I see it as a big\nbarrier and my job is to reduce barriers\ncould we for every student in Georgia\nHighlands go ahead pay for that textbook\nand the answer was yes and so on top of\nthat they offer a tuition assistance\nprogram and scholarships that that do\nhave a work requirement because once\nagain there has to be some form of\nreciprocity in this agreement and that's\none way for the hospital to go ahead and\ntry to bridge that gap between them\ngraduating and them deciding they're\ngoing to you know see the world but you\nmay need to spend a little time at\nAdrian Hill Floyd contractually\nand that's a good thing for everyone\nbecause you know like I said you we are\nserving a very diverse group of people\nthat don't all need to see the travel\nnurse World they just really need to\nimmerse themselves into the practice and\nget all of the barriers uh for a few\nyears\num some of the bigger things that I I\nonce again this is only a month old but\nI'm going to tell you that antidotally\nthis is the first time I've heard this\nin 14 years\nthey gave funds for faculty retention\nokay and with that faculty retention not\nonly is a bonus uh we won't call it a\nbonus it is an actual Market adjustment\nof salary from the state appropriated to\nthe market rate\nthis is the first time in 14 years I've\nheard a nursing instructor tell me or\nlook to the Future like in the next\nthree or four years I'm gonna do X\nthat is the first time in 14 years as\nbeing a part of the Health Sciences I\nhave heard a nursing faculty look\ntowards the future it's been very you\nknow short-lived and so things like\ntuition reimbursement and tap and all of\nthose things are great for nursing\neducation but really getting market rate\nto what it would be comparative to those\naround us and I'm going to tell you that\nnursing education comes at you really\nreally fast and so it takes three to\nfive years until I have a very rooted\nnursing instructor that is pumping out\nvery good nursing students and so if I\nhave high turnover that once again leads\nto the dean doing the director's job the\ndirector is doing the instructor's job\nand my instructor's scrambling around\ntrying to figure out what Nursing\neducation is and so that was one of the\nbig selling points that I found it\nreally is going to lead to not only you\nknow long-term growth for Georgia\nHighlands but actually trying to fix the\nworkforce\nand then I have any questions\nthis is very informative\noh it makes it makes such a difference\nthe investment that was being made\nthat's the door opener you know George\nis one of two states in the nation that\ndoes not have a broad\num\nneeds-based scholarship for\npost-secondary training\nGeorgia and New Hampshire go figure\nand what we've heard all day is that\nwhen you infuse the system and remove\nFinancial barriers as someone testified\nearlier it's all about the cash when you\ndo that people can can move forward and\nand aspire to their dreams\nand feel invested in feel valued you\nknow so I just think that's that's to me\nis one of the the big neon signs from\ntoday and you've just supported\nuh your your account has just supported\nthat I will add one more thing to this\ntoday I had in my head\num many many times is we have signed a\nmatriculation agreement with West\nGeorgia and so remember my my pipeline\nhad three\nblockages number three is my nursing\neducation on the top side so\nwhen I saw that you know the hospital is\nreally out of Masters prepared nurse\nEducators my first thought was why don't\nI try to make a way for my RN to BSN to\nget into an MSN quicker find ways to\nfund them I am actually now growing my\nown nurse Educators which strengths and\nstrengthens my ability to do clinicals\nand so West Georgia and myself we have\nopened a matriculation agreement that\nallows our RN to BSN students six\ncredits sooner to the MSN so they can\nexchange six of their BSN credits\ntowards the MSN and you know we've\nthought of a lot of creative Department\nof Labor grants and all of those things\nare on the table now that we have this\ntrue pipeline of actually growing our\nown in the area because that's super\nimportant it's a quick follow-up\nyeah this is short we heard stories this\nyear the session of\nnurse Educators those who train uh\nnurses or people to be nurses are\nleaving because they're getting paid\nless than what they would earn being a\nnurse\nhow do you how are you addressing that\num with the slide before that with\nAtrium Health Floyd coming to the table\nand bridging that gap between what I\ncould offer as an average faculty salary\num you know I'm I'm at a lower end of\ntuition so 95 a credit hour was super\nlucrative for recruiting students but\nsimple math would prove that 95 a credit\nhour doesn't allow me to keep up with\nMarket adjustments such as in nursing\neducation so\num you know\nI was a little kid with a lemonade stand\nonce and I was told no over here so I\njust went ahead and said I'm gonna walk\nover to the hospital and see if somebody\nwill bridge the gap between X and Y and\nthey said absolutely because they see\nthe value in not only making Market\nadjustments to that level because it\nwill help me recruit eventually but it's\ngoing to help me retain and that's\nthat's the long-term play for me is to\nalso make sure that this is sustainable\nso that's my next venture is to worry\nabout what 2028 Georgia Highlands looks\nlike and so that's you know what we're\ntrying to do here is to make sure that\nyou know those people are recognized\nthat are really trying to fix those\ntypes of things that really are Unified\nno matter what part of the state you're\nin\nCenter Jackson thank you Mr chairman I I\ncommend the work that you all are doing\nmy mother taught nursing at a university\nsetting for 30 years\nand and made the salary Choice um to do\nthat because of a commitment to nursing\nso I appreciate that others won't have\nto do that\num my question is you know we heard that\nfor physician training only 58 of them\nare staying in state or I don't know\nwe've heard different numbers but a lot\nof people are coming and getting\neducated here in Georgia and and then\ntaking that education elsewhere\nwhat is that looking like for your\nnursing program are you raising\nhomegrown girls and and Men boys you\nknow are you and they staying at home\num or or are they going off to other\nstates so the university system just uh\ninvested heavily in a data program\ncalled stepping blocks and according to\nStepping blocks Georgia Highlands 87\npercent of those that are graduating are\nstaying within the Northwest footprint\nand so one of the five counties that we\nserve so I don't have Universal Georgia\ndata but I have off the top of my head\nGeorgia Highlands data which I feel as\nthough although you can't assume all of\nthis could be recreated and replicated\nbut I I you know I've been in education\nlong enough to know that you know a lot\nof our problems are really synonymous\nthroughout the state and we have echoed\neach other multiple multiple times as\nfar as I'm educating the person that I\nsee 20 years from now at the Applebee's\nand you know they're they're right here\nthey're you know calling me and waving\nme down when I'm kayaking on Lake\nAllatoona and you know I know that\nthey're staying exactly where we\neducated them\nokay thank you\nanybody else\nwell thank you very much I don't know\nwhy I use Applebee's I haven't been down\nyes thank you that was just great that's\nreally incredible\nand last but not least we've got Chad\nBlack\nwho's the chairman of Georgia Emergency\nMedical Services Association\nthank you\n[Music]\nfirst of all thank you for letting me\ncome and speak on behalf of Ems for the\nstate I'll be brief today a lot of what\nyou've heard from from everyone else\nthe workforce issues the funding and\neverything else is it folds right over\ninto Emergency Medical Services\nback in 2007 Senator Mullis and I told\nyou did a Workforce study you probably\nremember that and\na lot of that\num\nhas come to fruition even worse today\nnow some things have been\nsolidified some some of my friend lives\nwith a trauma commission and the work\nthey've done in cooperating with us in\nour partnership we've done a lot on\neducation but we're still struggling\nand and this was way before\nagain before covet hit which just\nexacerbated everything for for everyone\nin the Health Community but um you can\ngo to the next one\nof the biggest challenges that we have\nis the same again as nurses is Dr\nHatchett talked about is finding people\nwho want to come into the profession and\nthen keeping them in the profession\nwe're seeing more and more in one of our\nand this is nothing against the\nhospitals but one of our biggest\nchallenges now is with a nursing\nshortage\nthe hospitals have gotten smart they\nrealize paramedics can work in place a\nlot of places in the cath labs and\nstroke labs in place of a nurse and\nthey're able to pay them more for Less\nhours and we're losing the cream of the\ncrop in paramedics to the hospital\nsetting\nI don't it's hard when I was a fire\nchief before I retired it's hard when\nsomebody comes in says Chief I don't\nwant to leave but uh I'm gonna make ten\ntwelve thousand dollars more and work 20\nhours less a week and be home with my\nfamily every night\ncan't argue with that\num\nyou can go now and be a licensed nurse\nand about the same time it takes to go\nto EMT school whether it's MTB or a and\nthen after that go to paramedic school\ncome out and make double right off and\nyou know shortly you'll be making a\nhundred thousand dollars a year where\nthe paramedics not going to do that so\nwe face that and again I talked about\nthe hospital issue\num the technical colleges we've got a\nlot that it talked about in there some\nof those and the urban areas are no\nlonger doing EMT and paramedic programs\nI was told I've not confirmed it but\nNorth Georgia Tech here who has a\nprogram could not even do their\nParamedic program this time because they\ndidn't have enough to enroll to\nsufficiently to start the class\nnext slide\nsome of the other challenges Public\nSafety retirements in Georgia you got to\nGeorgia firefighters pension fund that\nI'm I'm drawing from it's a great great\nbenefit being a firefighter retired a\nGeorgia police officers have the annuity\nand benefit fund George Sheriff's\nAssociation has their retirement fund\nEMS nothing and one of the issues with\nthat is is you know the sheriffs and\npolice are local and County governments\nEMS we have local and County government\nfunded EMS but we also have private and\nwe have Hospital based in the state now\nmost I'm not I believe all the\nhospital-based none of those currently\noperate under an authority anymore so\nthere basically would be considered\nprivate also so that creates challenges\nfor us trying we've been trying for 20\nyears to do a supplemental retirement\nfor EMS only\nlike the firefighters and law\nenforcement has but we're struggling\nand a lot of this is going to be looked\nat at the federal level we were going to\nhire a group out of DC to try to get\nthere's no one pension that covers City\nCounty government private and Hospital\nbased\nbut they were looking at changing\nfederal law to do that they wanted a\nhundred thousand dollars from Jim's to\nstudy and couldn't guarantee us that\nthey could get it pushed through and\nthere's no way we could afford that that\namount of money for that next slide\nagain some of the challenges from a\nnational level you've got a national\nfire chief through the National Fire\nAcademy at the U.S fire Administration\nyou got to chief law enforcement officer\nthat's the United States Attorney\nGeneral\nthey get a lot of benefits from Grants\nand stuff on the federal level fire I\ngot a lot when I was at Hall County and\na lot when we were at Habersham very\nfortunate because we were fire-based EMS\nNational there is no National EMS Chief\nor director that actually falls under\nthe U.S Department of Transportation and\nthe transportation secretary and you\nknow you I've never in my four-year\ncareer heard her\nSecretary of Transportation mentioned\nEMS one time it's Planes Trains and\nAutomobiles so\nthis is a major issue that that is\noccurring um this is something I chose\nnot to do but mandatory overtime you got\npeople working I'll take this County\nwhere I left and retired completely back\nin January of 2022\nwe didn't do mandatory overtime but\nthere's truck two ambulances here out of\nthe six that they run that averages\neight to ten calls per truck a shift\nmost of those transports go out of\nCounty\nnow with Northeast Georgia here I think\nthings are going to get better they're\ngoing to be able to keep more patients\nand not send out so many of the\nnon-acuity but that's that's a two-hour\ncall so you run 10 calls you pretty much\ntaken that up stats show that 18 hours\nof No Sleep is the same as registering\n.08 intoxicated on that's right it is so\nmandatory overtime in a lot of these\ndepartments forcing people they've been\nworking 24.\nthey work the next 24 and now they're\nrunning eight to ten calls again\nyou want that person coming to you or\nyour family after the back end of a 48\nhour shift at five o'clock in the\nmorning plus accidents are up\num\nbut again we're going to have to have\nthem up with Congressman Clyde and\nlooking at some federal things you know\nI don't know what we're going to do but\nthe Staffing issue started back in 07\nand you'll see in that report next slide\num\nback then in 07 the estimated cost was\nand that was right about a half a\nmillion dollars per ambulance for EMT in\nparamedic\nfor a 24 hour or for three shifts 24 on\n48 off but staff one ambulance was half\na million dollars that is in excess of a\nhundred thousand dollars after coven an\nambulance it was a hundred and sixty\nthousand dollars just two and a half\nyears ago was 325 to 340 000 today\nit's increased that much over double to\nbuy an ambulance now the smaller Vans if\nyou're Firebase DMS you've got to have\nthe boxes to be able to put the gear in\nthe sides the turnout gear and things\nlike that you can get the Vans a little\ncheaper for services that run that don't\nparticipate in fire also but still your\nStaffing that's still up here around\nthree quarters of a million dollars even\nwith that or more\num\nGAO reported you see the average cost\nper ambulance transport was 415 dollars\ntoday Medicare Medicaid reimbursement\nrates are still low and about that same\nit's really we've not had really an\nincrease\nin many many years in Medicaid or\nMedicare yes ma'am\nwe did and that was part of of this that\nwas hampering us you're right we brought\nthat to you and thank you for doing that\nwhere that saved Habersham County\ncitizens from having to pay about\neighteen thousand dollars a year to\nlicense all the ambulances in the county\num Cobb County where you're from it\nsaved him about a half a million dollars\ndoing that\num so that was listening you are no no\nsome things like that and some of the\nthings and that's what I was going to\npoint out as I said earlier some of the\nthings in this report that was one of\nthem we got that accomplished this year\n16 years later uh the trauma\nthe trauma commission again with Liz and\nthem I can't say enough about what\nthey've done in their cooperation and\nworking with us in Partnership we offer\nuh through gemsa\nabout a hundred and eighty thousand\ncontact hours a year of EMS education\nthat is free that comes through the\nsuper speeder funds with the money that\nwe get from the trauma commission most\nwe're the only state in the nation that\nwe know of that offers this we have a\nlot of States calling us I know what it\nis they do about how are y'all doing\nthis and it's that partnership there\nso I'll if anybody in the room has got a\nsuper speed or final simply say thank\nyou but slow down please\nokay uh yes ma'am\nI'm scared to read the paper anymore sir\nyeah\nuh yes sir you're right\na big time Big Time next slide we'll get\nus back on the rails here yeah go ahead\noh also back in that report you'll see\nthat uh ambulance is provide more\nuncompensated care than any other major\nhealth care provider back then it was up\nas high as 16 and a half percent today I\nworked with Pete and some of us putting\nsome numbers together that's about 25 so\nyou take that\num we cannot deny transport we're pretty\nmuch obligated to transport if they want\nto go but we brought off anywhere from\n40 to 60 percent and then if you've got\ncontractual allowances that you've got\nwith providers or anything like that\nthat can be up to 40 percent so it's\nit's a non-money it's a losing game\num it's it's at a critical stage now\nback reports are showing that 2020 2021\nwhen covid was at its peak we lost one\nthird of the workforce in EMS Nationwide\nand a lot of them's just getting out of\nit um next slide\num this is a summary from the governor's\nHealth Care Workforce I was able to go I\nbelieve we were in Albany and testified\non that last year early last year\num that report came out but um we are\nSupply constrained from the workforce\nlike everyone else\num\ncommissioner members reported challenges\nin recruiting U.S new EMS workers due to\ndiscouraging exam Pass rates and we do\nhave discouraging Pass rates in Georgia\num\nthose are not anywhere where they need\nto be and again that's on a multitude of\nfactors it's not just one particular\nthing but\num\ncommission interviews back then are\nstill the lack of access and I know Leo\nhas talked about that earlier the access\nto level one Trauma Centers and died on\nTransportation times hamper the delivery\nof care we've still got major wall time\nissues at a lot of hospitals where an\nambulance transports and you see all the\ntime communities complaining that their\nresponse times are up\nthose ambulances can't respond to a call\nwhen they're sitting in the ER or the\npatient in the ER can't take them down\nin the Columbus area wall times can be\nthree to five hours waiting to take a\npatient off the stretcher\nthat excessive so when you've got in the\nyou know 911 calls don't stop coming in\nand then that also for services like\nhere at Haversham that also does the\ndischarges or transfers from here to\nanother facility\nif they can't transfer the patient out\nwith throughput to be able to get beds\nopen to get them out of the ER doesn't\nexist so that that's a major problem\nthat we're running into capacities at\nhospitals they're full ambulances are\nhaving to wait that means 9-1-1 calls\nare waiting I was in going to Atlanta\nnot long ago\num dialed 9-1-1 in Gwinnett County to\nreport a wreck with injuries and I got\nyou have reached Gwinnett County 9-1-1\nplease remain on the line all operators\nare busy now can you imagine if that's a\nloved one and their families in Cardiac\nArrest or their house is on fire and\nthey get put on hold it happens every\nday because of the backup and everything\nnot only that 911 operators are\nexperiencing the same thing we are next\nslide\nI talked a little bit about the reduced\nfunding the consolidation of the tech\ncolleges Augusta and Dublin they don't\nno longer offer EMS education programs\nthere and while it helps the economy of\nscale for the schools it's devastating\nwhen students have to travel 100 plus\nmiles just to go to the interior\nparamedic school\num\nit's remained stagnant the average Pass\nrates for the EMT and advanced EMT for\nover a decade now and you know and we're\nin an industry we just can't maintain a\n35 waste factor and remain viable\nanymore\num this is just from EMS education this\nis just things that the technical\nschools could do\num train capacity have an expanded\ncapacity to train EMS workers hybrid\ncourse options connected to rural areas\nthat's not at the main campus and some\nof the areas here that they do that in\nsome areas\num\ntrying to find more instructors for EMS\neducation is just a multi-faceted\nproblem\nbut um\nreforms in education it could promote\ndecreased ambulance response times\nincrease in recruiting and retention and\nhigher Pass rates so again we're having\nproblems at the educational level here\nat Haversham before I left they're still\ndoing it we had to revert to doing our\nown EMT school in-house Pete's had to do\nthat with Metro he's been doing the fire\ndepartment itself Emergency Services we\nhad to go out and fortunately we had\nsome of our employees that were EMT\ninstructors so we're able to do that\nin-house but that comes at a great cost\nwe do around the state with gems to\noffer through again the trauma\ncommission funding we offer EMT and EMR\nprograms that can be done free a cost in\nthe rural communities we've seen a\nlittle bit of a decrease in that\nactually over the past few years still\ndoing it but but still a decrease but\nthe rural communities if you know\nthey've taught or Dr Hatchet talked\nabout it um\nif you can't ambulate or drive yourself\nto the hospital you got to have an\nambulance and a lot of times there's no\nambulances out there to take you people\nare waiting they're waiting to be\ntransferred out into tertiary Center\nit's it was nothing when I was here to\nhave all six ounces all tied up and on a\ncall and having to rely on a surrounding\nCounty to come into our County to\nrespond to that call the next one that\ncame in\nnext slide that's it\nwhy do we see all the time uh I'm\nAtlanta downtown Atlanta in town heart\nof Atlanta\nand uh but constantly I think this is\ntrue everywhere uh when a 911 call comes\nin we'll have a fire truck two\nambulances\nwhat is going on I mean I do not I said\nthis board just all like to come out of\nhere you know to the latest thing I\ncan't figure it out I can explain that\nwe've been doing we actually had a we've\nbeen doing Town Hall EMS meetings all\nacross the state cooperation with Gams\nalso VMS and Trauma trauma Commission\nand uh listening to the pmts and\nparamedics but also talking about issues\nand one of the things I said and I've\nupset some fire chiefs but as a fire\nchief I can say that we are sending fire\napparatus on calls they don't need to be\ngoing on they don't need to be going to\nthe doctor's office uh for an elevated\ntroponin that needs to go up the road to\nthe hospital for tests we have taken\n9-1-1 that was created in Alabama many\nmany years ago and we have turned it\ninto 4-1-1 on steroids but if I come to\nthis ER with an earache\nI'm probably gonna wait two or three\nhours maybe if they're busy before I see\na doctor and that's okay but if I call\n911\nto come get me almost immediately and we\nhave created this monster that we're\ngoing to have to start looking at\nyou know\nyes\nthank you very much for your\npresentation 9-1-1 started in my\nhometown in Haleyville Alabama that's\nright FYI thank you the first red phone\nSmithsonian now\num\nso uh I this is much appreciated for you\nto have brought us the old study\ncommittee report what would also be\nreally helpful is if you could go\nthrough the old report and kind of tell\nthe committee what's still needs to be\ndone and what's already been checked off\nbecause not all of us were there in\n2007.\nthe Staffing issue a retention not only\nor retention but attracting and\nretaining is still a major issue now we\nhave what's compared to back then\nthe number of EMTs and paramedics in the\nstate is a lot more than what it is in\nthis report it was at about 12 or 13 000\nwe're about 24 25 000 now but we've\ngrown as a state rapidly over that year\nagain back then Habersham was running\ntwo ambulances they're running six now\nso you know you had to have increased\nStaffing so the Staffing and retention\nthe education is an issue I know Liz has\ntalked about still in the rural areas\nhere we are very fortunate with\nNortheast Georgia a great Trauma Center\nstroke center and cardiac center but you\nget down below Atlanta and getting some\nareas\nif if it's not a pretty day and you\ncan't be flown\nand you're an acute trauma it could be\ntwo hours before you get to that Trauma\nCenter\num so those are the major ones is\nStaffing as far as attracting and\nretaining same thing that the nurses\nindustry the Physicians are going\nthrough our education we've got to get\nit spread around the state on the\ntechnical level better than what it is\ntoday\num and then we've got to look at some\nkind of retirement plan that we can do\nthat's a carrot to it it's not going to\nbenefit anybody like me or people that's\nbeen in a long time but we've got to\nfind something that's a supplemental\nretirement like law enforcement and\nfirefighters have for EMS and that's\nprobably going to have to come from the\nfederal level or some help from them if\nI remember Mr chairman one follow-up I'm\nconcerned about the test uh failure rate\nthat you talked about I'm serving The\nJoint Defense commissioner and the\nmilitary has run into the same thing\nwith their testing they've either got\npeople who can't pass for whatever\nreason or they can't pass a drug test or\nhave some other disqualifying thing\nobesity or whatever and I imagine\nthat the same people that are thinking\nabout being an EMT or paramedic are also\nthinking about other Health Sciences so\nwhat's the difference between the\ntesting and how can we address that\nthat's a good question\num I know also VMS and Trauma has worked\non some things and looking at different\nthings on on the education level and\nwhat the problems have been there's been\nsome data put out but I don't have\naccess to that data that would need to\ncome from Michael Johnson who's the oems\nand Trauma director in his office\num\nbut some of the issues you talked about\nare some of the same ones faced in that\ntoo absolutely\nyeah let me jump in real quick so we had\nthe\nexecutive director for the Georgia\ntrauma commission here earlier this\nmorning\nand she was testifying earlier and I\nasked her\num specifically in regards to South\nGeorgia and the time it takes for a\npatient who is injured on I-75 for\nexample to get to a Trauma Center Oscar\nshould we focus on\nbuilding new Trauma Centers in more I\nguess strategic locations in South\nGeorgia or focus on\nbettering the transportation\nfor trauma patients to get to the Care\nCenters and she said transportation and\nmore focus on EMS do you agree with that\nand if you do what do you think we could\ndo as a state to help specifically in\nsouth Georgia where you know North\nGeorgia we're closer to Atlanta than we\nare and we've got Greenville and we've\ngot Chattanooga but in south Georgia\nthere's places where you're two two and\na half hours right and most East correct\nand most of those and I totally agree\nwith Leo's on that\num and the other thing that people most\nof those rural areas are small rural\ncommunities that doesn't have a hospital\nor they've got a small hospital so when\nthey leave with that ambulance that may\nbe the only ambulance that Community has\nso now they're gone on a two-hour\ntransport and that's two hours back so\nfour or five hours they're gone and no\ncoverage or backup maybe in that but if\nit's a major accident they're all gone\nthere's no coverage in that county so\nthat's another issue\num again we run into because we have\nprivate services that provide great\nservice that's you know if a county\nchooses a private provider uh to to be\ntheir Zone provider that is what they\nchose and and that's okay\nuh as Jim so we represent the privates\nand and County Cities Hospital law we\ndon't differentiate between any of them\nbut um that does create issues when it\ncomes to talking about retirement or\nstate funds going to help something like\nthat when you've got private providers\nin it but they have we've got to find a\nway to include them we can't exclude\nthem because most of your County\nServices overall the gwinnetts and halls\nand large ones they don't do the\ntransfers from hospital a to hospital B\nthey don't do the patient discharges you\nhave to have those private providers\nthat do the majority of that\nand and if we don't it would completely\ncollapse the system so we've got to find\na way to help get salaries up we've got\nto find a way to get better education\nand we've got to find a way to keep\npeople want to do the job I mean we're\nyou know we've been hearing law\nenforcement bad and they've got a huge\nissue too but we're in the same boat\ndoctors or doctors nurses EMS\num\nSenator Jackson\nI have a few questions\num one last year we heard a presentation\nfrom somebody down at Mercer about\num those who people who are incarcerated\nwho were trained as firefighters in the\nways that they are saving lives in rural\nGeorgia because they're firefighters\nwhat can we do to get those folks\ncross-trained as EMTs as well uh we I've\naddressed that uh Georgia we we you go\nthrough EMT school paramedic school and\nthen Georgia back when I took years ago\nhad their own tests through the\ncomposite State Board of medical\nexaminers now it is through the National\nRegistry of EMTs and um if you they're\nnot going to allow that um one of the\ngirls and I'll that Alto here the the\nladies prison here provides fire\nServices backed us up those ladies were\nphenomenal uh going to Tallulah Gorge\nwith us on Gorge rescues uh one of them\nI couldn't hire at the time but we\nhelped get her a job in White County she\nhas made a tremendous turnaround and\nwe've just helped her to get a complete\npardon in National Registry acceptance\nPastor EMT and she's working here in\nHaversham part-time too so that I wanted\nto go down to the prison at that time\nand be able to put them through EMT\nschool that was part of the fire\ndepartment so when they got out they was\nready for a job but National Registry\ndoes not allow that\nand so that glutes back to us no longer\nhaving our own certification system\nwhich\nmaybe we should look at that there's\nthere's\nbeing nationally nationally awarded is\nreally important for those who can be\nboarded but if we want to expand our\npool that might be an option secondarily\nI'm also interested I know that a lot of\nfire service is provided across the\nrural Georgia through volunteer\nfirefighters is there an effort to\nrecruit them to be cross-trained as EMTs\nas well a lot of them are in those areas\nthey're at least medical First\nResponders and some of them are EMTs but\num\nand and those are vital those first\nresponder programs were vital especially\nin the rural areas and that's a lot of\nwhat you see Senator is the fire going\nout you know as I said EMS that has the\nzone to provide 9-1-1 they have a duty\nand an obligation to respond fire\ndepartments that do not run EMS they\nhave a desire to First respond and\nthat's the right desire but we're going\non a lot too many calls we're sending\nthose fire apparatus on calls that\nprobably sometimes an animals really\nshouldn't even be going on and we're\ngoing to have to look at you know\nthrowing all these resources we're going\nto have to look at a tiered EMS system\nsome places are doing it Grady does it\nClayton County Fire where you match the\n9-1-1 call through EMD at the 911 Center\nyou triage it there and you send the\nappropriate level of care to the call\nyou don't send a paramedic in reality a\nparamedic probably needs to go on\nless than 15 20 of the 911 calls that\ncome in and then one one final question\nso I know in a lot of our high schools\nwe've created programs where you can get\nlicensed as a cosmetologists as a CNA\nthere are all these Pathways\num how how do we get ENT we did part of\nthat right before I retired we started\nthat in Haversham and chief Adams is\ntaking it they should get their first\nclass out through cooperation with North\nGeorgia Tech and be EMT firefighters\nwhen they're if they're 18 and they've\nbeen able to take their exam of course\nof course but don't\nand and the thing I hope and I want to\ncome back and see it is that when they\nget their high school diploma Chief\nAdams is waiting at the bottom of the\njob application form and keep them you\nknow we kind of called it homegrown so\nworking with Habersham Central and and\nthat program is active here now Clayton\nCounty has a very robust program down\nthere Chief Merchants did a great job\nstarting that that's great\nthrough Clinton County Fire yeah Chief\nmarkison started he's in County\nAdministration now but they he's at the\nbottom of the stage or was and was\noffering job applications and they knew\nwho was going to work so when they\ngraduated they were going right into the\nfire and EMS\nso we're looking at there's some things\nthat's been worked on like that that's\nbut only a few areas are doing that so\nand it's a heavy lift to try to do all\nthat and provide the service too\nbut you know we're looking at all\noptions so again I appreciate the time\nyou've heard a lot of infusing uh uh the\nthe situation addressing the situation\nwith with uh paid scholarship paying for\nthe training it's investing in the\nstudents and how much of that are you\nseeing happening uh well a lot of the\nyounger ones can get hope which is a\ngreat thing for this state to go to EMT\nbut paramedic school but once the\nproblem is once they go through Mt\nschool and they some of them exhaust all\nof their funds and they can't get it to\ngo into that that post-education if they\nwant to get their degree or anything\nlike that they use all of that for EMT\nand some of paramedics so a lot of that\nis being used now for older ones that\nwant to get in you know there's people\nthat's wanting to get into the business\num sometimes they're not eligible to\nreceive that or somebody that started\none career\nas far as using their money for that and\nthen decides to change so it is it's\nit's a cost issue too it's very\nexpensive to to send it to school\nbut that it turns out that's what's\nworking oh yeah yeah absolutely so\npursuing that approach\nthank you\nthank you Chad thank you all for coming\ntoday I think this has been very\nproductive uh you know y'all are here\nbecause you care there's a lot of smart\npeople in the room I would encourage you\nif if someone in another area came and\ntestified today that you you know may\nhave heard something that you think\ncould work I would encourage y'all to\ncollaborate reach out to each other if\nyou need someone's contact information\nplease reach out to John or Bernita and\nsend us those ideas as we move along in\nthis process we're going to limit what\nwe're looking at moving forward but if\nthere's anything that really stands out\nthat you think hey we could we could\nmake a difference here please don't be\nshy this is why we invited you here and\nthis is why you're in the room so just\nthank you again Northeast Georgia\nMedical Center thank you for the\ncommittee members Bernita John y'all did\na great job and thank you everyone for\nattending I I think this has been very\nsuccessful and I technically got us out\n13 minutes early so thank you guys\nthank you",
