And so we find that he was gracious enough to say, yeah, I'll\ncome. And this individual has three children, Isaiah, Zaria, and appropriate enough Georgia.\nHe's well educated. He has had some masters of divinity from theological seminary. He\nHe works, he's worked in Missouri for 15 years as a pastor there, but now he is the senior\npastor at the First Baptist Church in Blakely, Georgia.\nAnd I found that he is doing the Lord's work throughout not only our area, but throughout\nthe world.\nI learned very quickly that he is a board member of other most international, which provides\nK through 12 education for 1600 students for free in India.\nHe's really working to make sure that the Gospel is spread.\nHe is the author of winding road of problems and currently working on another book, The People of Paul.\nLadies and gentlemen, please welcome my good friend, my new pastor, Chris Gaffey.\nChris Gaffey.\nWell thank you Mr. Speaker, Representative Green, it is a privilege to address this honorable\nbody.\nI was going to tell a joke, but I have learned, however, that since being invited on this privilege\nthat there are a lot of rules.\nI was told that I had to be here on time, which I failed to dress properly, which I hope\nI succeeded in, and that I was not allowed to make any comments about politics.\nAnd no more was I allowed to make any jokes.\nThat was my brides' rules, and then came the speakers' rules.\nThe speakers office informed me that I had to keep my remarks to approximately five minutes\nthat asking a Baptist preacher to do that is about like asking Auburn football to beat\nthe mighty Georgia Bulldogs.\nIt is not going to happen anytime soon\nand the best we can do is hope to run out the clock.\nRight before I came up,\nRepresentative Prince came up and told me\nto ignore those rules and take as long as I wanted.\nI knew there had to be one righteous politician in Georgia.\nI'll do my best to abide by those rules however\nAnd so let me get to the task at hand\ninto the 250 years of our nation's history.\nThere have been a number of similar moments.\nMoments that were so important that they required\nconsequential leaders.\nLeaders of unparalleled character, skill, and ability,\nand as a nation, I think we would all agree\nfrom every political strive that we have been blessed\nover these many years.\nThe list of leaders is long, but perhaps the most\ninfluential and important is a man whose birthday we celebrate this month, the very first president\nof the United States, Mr. George Washington. He was born on February 22, 1732 in the colony\nof Virginia, and so that means that this nation was always his home. At age 22, he literally\nstarted a world war as he was the commander of the Virginia forces in the French and Indian\nWar. At the birth of the American Revolution in 1775, you know that he was tasked with\nthe responsibility of leading a Ragtag Army of Rebellion against the most powerful nation\nin the world. Name Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, his task was impossible.\nHe had to take untrained, albeit passionate men into battle, without the proper ammunition,\nsupplies, or even the proper clothing. He marched them against the British Army, suffering\nboth victories and defeats, and when Troop Morale reached its lowest moments, he was\nsingularly responsible for doing whatever was necessary to maintain the fight.\nWhen independence was finally won, he would be given an even greater challenge.\nHe was given the responsibility of bringing politicians together in harmony.\nHe was named the President of the Constitutional Convention, and when it was time for a new\nnation to elect its first President, Washington was named the man for the job.\nIn retrospect, we can barely fathom how daunting a task it must have been for him.\nHe not only had to govern without much direction, but he was also setting precedent for our\nfuture leaders and presidents about how this new nation would be governed and led.\nIn the history of Americans, he stands with great distinction.\nHe was a leader of men, he was the general of an army, he was the president of a new nation,\nand he was the leader of a new and freer and more prosperous world.\nAnd we imagine him, we think of a larger than life figure.\nIn fact, he was a man who was unafraid of anything, willing to take on any challenge,\na warrior, a hero.\nIn my life, he was the Chuck Norris of our politicians.\nAs much as we know about his service to this nation, we also know that he was a man of\ngreat faith.\nHe was raised to Anglican.\nWashington became something of a Christian wanderer in the years to come.\nIn his lifetime, he would join a host of churches and denominations, including the Presbyterians,\nthe Quakers, the Roman Catholic, the Congregationalists, even the Baptist for a season, and eventually\nthe Dutch reformed churches.\nSomewhere along the way, in Mr. Washington's life, the Gospel of Jesus Christ penetrated\nhis heart.\nI want you to listen briefly to a short prayer that he wrote at the end of his life.\nHe said, oh eternal and everlasting God, I presume to present myself this morning before\nthat divine majesty, besieging thee to accept of my humble and hearty thanks, that it\nhath pleased thy great goodness to keep and preserve me the night past.\nFrom all the dangers poor mortals are subject to, and has given me sweet and pleasant sleep,\nwhereby I find my body refreshed and comforted, for performing the duties of this day, in\nwhich I would besiege thee to defend me from all the perils of body and soul.\nThis my faith and the sweet promises of the gospel, give me repentance from dead works, pardon\nmy wanderings, direct my thoughts unto thyself, the God of my salvation.\nTeach me how to live in thy fear, to labor in thy service, and ever to run in the ways\nof thy commandments, make me always watchful over my heart, that neither the tears of conscience\nthe loathing of holy duties, the love of sin, nor an unwillingness to depart this life,\nThey cast me into a spiritual slumber, but daily framed me more and more into the likeness\nof thy son Jesus Christ, that living in thy fear and dying in thy favor, I may in the\nappointed time attain the resurrection of the just unto eternal life.\nAnd then he concluded, bless my family, my friends, and my kindred.\nIn that prayer, General Washington, we find not a warrior, not a general, and not a hero.\nIn that prayer, instead we find a simple and humble man who loved his God, sought God's\nfavor, and prayed for his nation, his family, and his friends.\nIn Micah 6 and verse 6, the prophet of old asked a question, he asked, what should I bring\nbefore the Lord when I come to bow before God on high?\nI think that is an important question.\nIt's a question that I believe all of mankind must answer in their life.\nWhat is it that God requires of me?\ndoes God want? Should I gain the great privilege of entering the presence of the\nan Almighty God whose person, nature and majesty, shutter the very foundations of\nthe world itself? What would this divine demand of me? Luckily God answered\nthrough the prophet. He writes in verse 8, mankind, he has told each of you what\nis good and what it is that the Lord requires of you to act justly to love\nfaithfulness and to walk humbly with your God. What would God ask of this\ndeliberative body on February the 5th, 2025? He would ask of you what he\nask of all men and women that you love and seek faithfulness in Jesus Christ,\nthat you act justly and that you walk with humility before a holy God. That is my\nprayer for you this morning. Would you stand and bow your heads and join me in\nprayer. Good and sovereign God, maker of heaven and earth, father of our Lord Jesus Christ,\nwe come before you in this appointed hour to seek your help. By your grace, you have\nsustained us through life and adversity, you have seen it appropriate to place us in these\nhollowed halls and to legislate in this great state. Our decisions and our attitudes\naffect our homes, our families, our friends, and many that we do not know.\nSuch a task is great and terrifying, and we are wholly unable to be faithful without\nyour good guidance.\nAnd so therefore in this hour we come humbly before you and seek your good assistance.\nWe ask for your spirit to give us insight, your word to instruct our wisdom, and your\nprecepts to be our guiding star.\nus into a better future, a greater faith, and a more glorious hope. Protect our nation,\nour families, and our friends, these things we ask in the name of our Blessed Savior, Jesus\nChrist, amen. Would you remain standing and join me in the pledge of allegiance?\nI pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for\nfor which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\nThank you very much.\nAppreciate it, brother.\nThe doorkeepers, you may unlock the doors, members.\nYou can join Brother Chris in the south any room to thank him for his message today.\nAnd take a photo if you like with him.\nBrother Chris, thank you for the message.\nHey, great history lesson as well too.\nThanks for that on our first president, George Washington.\nWhat a wonderful man.\nThank you.\nThe\nThe doctor of the day is from representative Debra Silcox's district, Dr. John Gleason.\nIf anyone has any medical needs, he'll be down in the nurses station.\nThe chair recognizes Chairman Hilton.\nPlease take your conversations to the back of the chamber or to the anning room.\nThe chairman of information and audits will now give the report of the committee.\nThank you, Madam Speaker.\nYour committee on information and audits has read the journal the previous day and found it to be correct.\nChairman Hilton, the chair of committee on information and audits reports that the journal of the previous legislative day has been read and found to be correct.\nIs there any objection to dispense with the reading of the journal?\nThe chair here is none the reading of the journals dispensed with is there any objection to the confirmation of the journal the chair here is none and the journal is confirmed\nThe clerk will read the resolution establishing the order the business of the day\nRepresentative association 104th loose follow-by establishes the ordered business during the first part of the period unanimous consensus\nIntroduction of bills and resolutions first reading and reference of house bills and resolutions\nsecond reading of bills and resolutions, reports of standing committees,\nmorning orders.\nIs there any objection to the adoption of the resolution establishing the order of the business for the day?\nThe chair here is now in the resolution is adopted.\nFirst reading of bills and resolutions, the clerk will read.\nHospital 226 by resident.\nMathis, the 133rd of building title and act to amend and act to provide a new charter for the city of Cochrane.\nIntergovernmental Coordination House Bill 227 by reps of Dickey the hundred and thirty four threes and ninety nine prints the hundred and thirty second\nHagen 156 throats of the hundred and twenty-fourth\nBill B.
