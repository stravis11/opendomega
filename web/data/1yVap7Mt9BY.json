As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the lady from the 52nd House District of the chamber. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, it is my honor and pleasure to introduce to you, Reverend Reginald Williams. He has been preaching since 1992, was ordained in 1994. He is an alumnus of Bryant Theological Seminary in May 2017. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in pastoral theology from Carver College and a certificate of theology from the Baptist International Bible Institute. He is also currently working on his masters. While Reverend Williams understands that academia doesn't make a preacher, he does believe it provides him tools that help him in his service to his congregation. In October 2002, Reverend Williams became the 13th pastor at Little Zion Baptist Church, which is located in Brookhaven's Linwood Park neighborhood, considered to be the oldest historically black neighborhood in DeCab County. He has been a strong leader for more than 20 years. Reverend Williams has established numerous new programs for its members, as well as establishing outreach programs in the communities such as ministering to seniors and prisoners. He has revitalized the youth program and is also added to deacon ministry. He is beloved by his congregation, and we are also celebrating a very important anniversary with them this year. Little Zion Baptist Church is 100 years old. We have some members of the congregation up in the gallery. We have his wife Cynthia, his daughter Jessica, and retired general Richard Dix, as well as other special guests. Could you all please stand so we can recognize you and celebrate your anniversary with you? Welcome to the People's House. In recognition of this milestone, it seemed only fitting to invite Reverend Williams to be our pastor of the day. And with that, Reverend Williams. To the speaker of the house, John Burns, Representative Shay Roberts, and all to make up this great Georgia House representatives is indeed an honor and a privilege to stand before you. I bring you greetings from the little Zion missionary Baptist Church in Brookhaven, Georgia. I am humbled and grateful for this opportunity. And then again, aren't we all humbled and grateful for the great opportunity we collectively possess at this present time? We have the blessed opportunity to serve and make great impact in this great state of Georgia and the greatest country in the world. We have a chance to change history to make history. The question naturally forms then in our mind. How do we make the best of this opportunity we have been entrusted with? At first glance, one would look for a high moral ethical view. One would say the principle of the Golden Rule. The Golden Rule has been posted in countless establishments for many centuries, even dating back to ancient times. In 1913, it was posted at the Atme Sucker Rod Factory in Toledo, Ohio, where there was a sign posted at the employee interest that says, therefore, what's every you would do that men should do to unto you? Do you even so one to them? The principle is treat others as one wants to be treated. This concept can be found in nearly all facets of life in almost every ethical tradition. In ancient Egypt, it is stated, now this is the command due to the doer to make him do. In ancient India, one writer wrote, one should never do something to others that would regard as an injury to one's own self. Ancient Greece writer put it this way. What you do not want to happen to you do not do it to your self either. The Golden Rule stands elevated in the highest point of moral ethics. However, it centers on loving others based on the individual's perception of love. Today, I asked the question, I want you to consider, there is a better way. We need something higher than moral ethics and personal values for the great opportunity we have been entrusted with today. For we, those who we serve, who we represent and labor deserve better. But what can be better than the Golden Rule? Recently in my ethics class of love, my professor asked us to define love. Now I'll spare you the mundane details and the statements that was given by many of my peers. But one thing was certain, love trumps on. Love looks beyond faults and supplies the need. True love provides what's needed, even if it is not light. Any of us remember parents providing penicillin to us, although it was not light, or providing vegetables to help us develop good healthy bodies, although the taste was undesired. It was all done for the good and in love. Well to further my case, Jesus shared on the subject of love. He declared in Mark 12, 30 and 31, that shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul, with all thy mind and with all thy strength. This is the first commandment, after which he shared the Golden Rule. And the second is like this, namely this, thou shall love thy neighbor as thy self. There is none other commandments greater than these. The first commandment centers and gives purpose and it should not be divorced from the second. Let us strive to love God with our whole being. And doing so, we will ensure that we will serve, we will serve in love and that love will be blind from our own prejudices. It will be motivated by pure love and boldness to stand no matter the challenge. I'm excited full of zeal and vigor because we have been chosen. Each of us have been chosen to serve this present time. We have been opportunity to leave our marker in history. Others have come and performed to the best of their ability. Now it's our time. It's our opportunity to do great things. Georgia House representatives, let's band together and march our state, our country forward, into a brighter future. I suggest we leave in an irrefutable mark and we can do this by the principal thing. Love. Let us pray. In short, our God our Father, Creator of all things, we are grateful for your love and for your faithfulness. Today is a new day. You have blessed us with a myriad of opportunities to have great impact today. For this I say thank you. Thank you for keeping all of us. Thank you for your many graces, for all of your goodness and your kindness, for choosing us to assemble here today. And we thank you for this great body. We pray, Lord God, that you will bless them. Most of you are a dain to stand and represent this country, this state. We pray, Lord God, for wisdom. We pray, Lord God, for understanding. We pray most importantly for compassion. Lord God, I pray that this great house would do things pleasing in your sight, that we may represent you and that this country will continue to be a beacon of light all around the world. Lord of all, so that any of our sins, we are God that we may have a right relationship with you. It is in Jesus' name I pray. Amen. We now have the pleasure of allegiance. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the reminded states of America and to the republic for which it stands. One nation.\n\nThank you. Thank you. Thank you. The door keepers will unlock the doors.

Let us welcome our doctor of the day, Dr. Walsh O'Sullivan. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is that a small horse farm or a small horse farm? Just checking. See, I'm glad y'all are listening. I'll call that right off and so did, excuse me, Reptidy Williams and Sharon Parsons. Okay, we're moving on to the rules, calendar, calendar. So we'll ask you to give your attention to the member in the well. Mr. Clerk, would you read the caption to Senate Bill 148? 148? Senate Bill 148 to be a title of the, by Senator Kennedy of the 18th and others to be a title of an act to amend chapter 3, a title of 14th. Senator Kennedy, the fiscal to Georgia, and TATA relating nonprofit corporations. So it's a comprehensively revised, simplified, modernized chapter and it's revised for the construction of said chapter this bill. I refer to the committee on judiciary. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Set time, need to give your attention to the member in the well. Representative Leopard has recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House, I'm presenting to you today Senate Bill 148. This is a comprehensive revision, rewrite, update, correction of the Georgia nonprofit corporation code. This always reminds me of one of the times I was traveling in Dillard and I saw one of those cedar shingles behind the cash register said this is a nonprofit business. We didn't intend it, it just turned out that way. I'm also talking with Chairman Dickey about one of his competitors who lamented that it was costing him 95 cents a pound of growth peaches and he's only selling them for 90 cents a pound. He said he's going to make it up on volume. That's not exactly what we're dealing with here today, but it's sort of like that. This is the, there are two kinds of corporations you can form in Georgia, business corporation, which is generally conducted for profit and a nonprofit corporation, which is generally conducted with an idea of not making money and distributing it to shareholders, perhaps making money but applying it to some other kind of charitable or social purpose. For example, the term nonprofit that we use here is not talking about nonprofit in the sense of taxation. It's talking about nonprofit in the sense of the internal structure of the corporation. Generally, if you're forming a foundation or if you, a lot of churches use this form, hospitals do clubs for like golf or hunting or track clubs and that sort of thing, use this kind of internal organization which does not generally, does not have shareholders. It may, may have members that have to have them, but it may. So it's a different kind of internal governance of the corporation that's more suited to the nonprofit context. It's a total separate chapter in the Georgia Corporation Code. There's a code for business corporations and a code for nonprofit corporations. We've amended the one for business corporations numerous times. We haven't really touched the nonprofit code for many, many years. So several years ago, the nonprofit law section of the state bar, the legislative committee undertook a project to review the code and basically rewrite the whole thing but with the sense of updating it, making corrections, clarifying provisions, addressing court decisions that had been issued interpreting the code and trying to conform the code to those provisions and just making grammatical changes and then updating the code with respect to changes and technology over the last 30 years. Ways of communicating, notice, so we tried to update the code with respect to that. So it's 193 beautiful pages and it basically does those things I have said. There are a few substantive changes most of which will, you know, you need to take your heart medication before I talk about them. There are things like changing core requirements, prohibiting a president from also being the secretary, who's using the secretary as to attest the signature of the president, making executive directors. A lot of nonprofits have an executive director. They're actually making that an officer so that it's subject to the duties and conflict of interest rules of officers and applying the duties of care to them. And I think I did mention quorum in the minimum number of directors. So very technical changes but ones that are very essential to allow these entities to function properly and hopefully not have to talk to their lawyer so much and spend money on legal fees but apply the funds they have to the purpose for which they exist. So that's the bill basically I'd be glad to stand if you have any questions. Gentlemen, you have several questions. Gentlemen, you yield? Yes. Gentlemen, night to your right is recognized for a question. To my friend and will. Would you yield for a couple of questions? I yield. And first of all to my friend, I'm sorry it's obviously a long bill and trying to read everything that comes through. I apologize for the lateness of the question. But I have a general question and in regards to rewriting this part of the code for charitable organizations. Isn't it true that we found that a lot of charitable organizations are set up and then they're leasing to or leasing from private entities or corporations that surround it with a profit motive and that's what I'm seeing and I'm asking the gentleman, is this identified in here or does this legislation or measure address any of that? I'm not aware that it addresses leases or contracts entered into between nonprofit and profit corporations. Thank you, sir. Gentlemen, you yield further? Yes. Representative Jasmine Clark is recognized for a question to your left. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does it, gentlemen, you? I yield, yes, ma'am. So you briefly, this is a pretty long bill and so you went through it very, very fast. You mentioned something about executive directors now being considered officers. So a lot of nonprofits, their executive directors are often a paid position whereas sometimes their board of directors is not a paid position. Does anything in this bill, is anything in this bill going to require a lot of these nonprofit organizations to completely restructure their organization now that the executive directors are on the same tier, I guess, as their board? I guess that's going to depend on the particular circumstances for each nonprofit but I'm not aware that it's going to require any changes to their overall structure. It simply makes it clear that the executive director has certain duties to the board and to the corporation just like any other officer would because they're basically fulfilling the duties of an officer. That's a gentleman for the year. Yes, ma'am. I'm asking is a lot of places in their bylaws, the board is unpaid but their executive director is not considered a part of the board. So if that is their structure, I'm guessing I'm asking for the nonprofits that might be watching us today. If that is their current structure, will they need to redo their bylaws to now change it to where certain board members can be paid so that they can pay their executive director? I would say, and I don't do a great deal of working this year, I do some, I serve on a nonprofit board and I do represent some. I don't believe anything in the bill would require them to change compensation or the general structure of the corporation if they have an unpaid board or unpaid director. Thank you. Thank you for the question. Mr. President, I can't or it is recognized to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Do you yield? Yes. How would this bill affect churches or religious entities that are also 501c3s? Well, if there are 501c3 corporation then it would affect them in the sense that it does impose these new rules I've discussed. However, most of the provisions about Quorum and those sorts of things can be changed by specific bylaw provisions or amendments to their articles of incorporation. So to the extent there's anything in here that they would not like, there are sort of escape hatches if you would for them to affirmatively provide a different rule for their operation. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Gentlemen, has no further questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I would appreciate your favorable support of Senate Bill 148. Thank you very much. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill. The yeas were 163. The nays 4, the bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate Bill 218? Senate Bill 218 by Senator Redd. The 33rd, another is to be titled an act to amend Article 5 of Chapter 5 of Title 40. The official go to Georgia annotated relating identification cards for persons without driver's license. So it's to provide for the issue and so by identification cards to persons completing a term of incarceration. Mr. Bill, I'm referring to the committee on public safety and homeland security. That committee recommends the disbilled do pass by committee substitute. Chairman Warkheiser is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Speaker Burns. This is a bill we can all get behind. This is a collaborative effort between the Department of Corrections, the Department of Pardoning Paroles and the Department of Driver Services. When our state inmates have fulfilled their obligation to the state and leave the prison system, we should do everything we can to help them gain employment. And other services in one way we can do this is to provide them a comprehensive packet of all the courses they've completed. Like if they've completed a welding course or any educational where they've gotten a GED. And then also to give them a state issued ID card. And that's what the bill does. Stand for any questions if there are any. You have a question representative Higley to your left has a question representative Higley. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Absolutely. I appreciate the bill. I do have a question though. Did you all discuss other things that you might be given to persons who have completed their time? Are we still at $25 an abust ticket home? What else do they receive as they are leaving and are reintegrating back into society? That's a great question. It was not discussed in this bill. Basically this was paperwork related to their leaving and not the other services. Now did Phil to mention that this was Senator Doc Redt's bill over in the Senate. He worked on this but we did not discuss the other issues. That was a great question. Gentlemen, you have another question? Yes, sir. Representative Roman is up the center aisle. I recognize for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. For the ID card, is this just the typical ID card that some people can also use to travel and everything else? Or is it different? That's a great question because we did not want to give this stigma or identification that this was a previous inmate. So the card is the same card as that you and I would get from the Department of Driver Services. If we wanted a card that did not want the privileges of driving. So it's just the same as everybody else. Great question. The gentleman has no further questions. I get asked for your favorable consideration on Senate bill. You do have one more. 218. Absolutely. It's a gentleman, Jill. I'm sorry. Yes. I'm going to give you. There's any Lisa Campbell has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Do you yield the will? Yes, ma'am. I just have a question about line 51. It says educational.\n\nSo, the grant will not apply to inmates who have attained 50 years of age. Just curious about that as an age cut off. I'm going to have to play the ignorance on that. I don't know. You have no further questions. I'd ask for your federal consideration on Senate Bill 218. General Zittlenow's standing job presenting the bill. We appreciate that. We appreciate the bill. We have a speaker in favor. Representative Kennedy has recognized the speaking favor of the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I just could just about fall on the floor and cry. This is such a great bill and such a great solution. In the program of which I'm the director, we work with homelessness and we get a lot of folks who are re-entering from our state prisons and county jails. And this is a significant problem. Someone who's being released. We have no ID. So we're spending months collecting their birth certificate, their social. And you usually take months before we get to the place of a state ID. And I've been asking for this for a year. So I appreciate this effort. It always made sense to me that they could leave incarceration with a state ID. There was some pushback saying, well, we didn't know if this is really that person. And I would always quit back. Well, we knew it was that person enough to convict them. But anyway, I'm just so glad that we came to this place today. It's a great bill. Please vote in support of SB218. Gentlemen, as you ordered the well, is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there an objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here's none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there an objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of the bill, the yeas were 171, the nays 0. The bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is there. The bill has received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate Bill 4747? Senate Bill 47, my senator, half-stuttle of the 52nd and others to be entitled to amend chapter 12 of the title 16 of the fiscal to Georgia and it's headed relating offenses against public health and morals. So, as we provide that vaping in restricted areas is a misdemeanor possible by a fine. This bill I'm referring to the committee on public health that committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair, related coupers recognize to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I bring you Senate Bill 47. And what this bill does, it puts vaping on the same status as smoking cigarettes. It does not expand anything. It just says, if you can't smoke in an area, you can't vape in an area. And that is what the bill does. And Mr. Speaker, if there are no questions, I'll yield the well. You have no questions. The lady has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered that Chair Hissnund, the previous question is ordered, is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair Hissnund, the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass, all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no and the clerk. We'll unlock the machine. 131. Okay. Have all members voted. Have all members voted. If so, the clerk will unlock the machine. All in the passage of the bill, the yeas are 152, the nays 14. The bill, having received the requisite Constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption to Senate Bill 131. 131. Senate Bill 131 by Senator Tillery, the 19th and others, to be entitled and act to amend part 13 of Article 3 of Chapter 11, in Title 15. The fiscal to Georgia, anti-derollating, permanent guardianship, still is required for service by publication. Ms. Bill, I refer to the committee on juvenile justice. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair Lady, Ballinger has recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I come before you to present SB 131. SB 131 has to do with permanent guardianships and service of process onto different parties to the permanent guardianship. Section 1 requires a guardianship petition hearing to be conducted in accordance with OCGA 29218. Section 2 adds requirements to the process of serving individuals related to the child who was not adjudicated as a dependent child. There are any other parties who appear to the court as proper or necessary to the proceeding. Section 3 and Section 4 are really to us as House members of the pertinent parts. That was a little added decoration that we put on over here in the House to address a very serious issue. Many of y'all know the issue to which I'm referring a young lady that was subjected to just horrific circumstances. It included her surviving parent who had actually murdered the other parent and all her other siblings. That the remaining parent that had murdered all of her family actually tried to get her sent back to Mexico to live with the murderers family. In this case it was the mother. So to that end we want to make sure that that doesn't happen again. So we added Section 3 which makes a conviction of a parent for murder or voluntary manslaughter of the other parent. A mandatory basis. It's a shall. The judge shall sever all parental ties between that parent and the child. For removing the child from a parent who was convicted Section 4 allows the court to exercise its discretion when determining the custody of a child. And if one parent has been indicted for the offense of murder or voluntary manslaughter of the other parent. So in other words they can hold it. It's completely within the judge's discretion that they can hold off on the permanent making that a permanent situation or they can kind of hold it in a bayance waiting until the parent is convicted whatever the judge would like to do in that instance. So that's the bill and I'll be happy to answer any questions. You have no questions. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I urge everybody's favorable consideration to SB 131. The lady has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill. The passage of the bill, the yays were 165. The days five. The bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk will you read a caption to Senate bill 213? Senate bill 213 by Senator Burns. The 23rd know there's to be a title of an act to amend chapter 66, a title 36. The official go to Georgia and Tate related zoning procedures so to prohibit local governments from preventing the continuance of a lawful, nonconforming use of property when a pre-existing manufactured home or mobile home is replaced with another such home. This bill I refer to the committee on governmental affairs that committee recommends that this bill do pass. Senator Washington has recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, the House I rise to present Senate bill 213, the sponsor of Senator Max Burns. This is a simple bill. It should be non-controversial. It allows existing owners of manufactured housing, manufactured home to replace that home with a new home, a new home that is manufactured housing. The three conditions that should be understood. First of all, the replacement home must be a new home and it must only be used as a single family residence. The owner has a year from the removal of the previous structure to replace it with the new structure. That is the bill and Mr. Speaker, I will yield any questions. You have a question. You yield for a question? Yes, sir. Representative Roberts, right out to your left in front of you is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Will the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. Isn't it true that this bill is going to be a way to maintain affordable housing. Often jurisdictions will rezone an area with the express purpose of kind of driving certain uses out. And these are folks that have lived in their homes and should be able to replace their homes and it's a way that we maintain a surplus of, or at least some affordable housing. Yes, ma'am. Thank you for that question. It is a great solution to our continuing challenge for affordable housing and thank you for that question. Gentlemen, yield? Yes, sir. I will for one more. Representative Wilkerson, and to your left in the back is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, sir. And I apologize when I asked him this earlier, but if there are code improvements or safety improvements that happen over time, like I know if you replace a water heater or whatever, you have to update to the new code. Does this impact any requirements that are required of new homes, but not old ones? No, sir, not to my knowledge. It just does specify that it has to be a new home, which certainly should meet all the requirements I would assume. Mr. Speaker and members of the House are your favorable consideration of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield a well. Gentlemen, will you take one question from Chairman Martin? I'm sorry to pop up about the time you said that if you will reconsider your own. Certainly, I will take a question from Chairman. Come on, yield. Yes, sir. Isn't it true that your bill states or that the Senator's bill states new mobile home? That is true. That is true. It isn't true that it wouldn't be legal for someone to manufacture those homes if they weren't up to current safety standards. Yes, sir. I believe that is true. I believe that would address the gentleman's previous question. I think so. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. No further questions? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield a well. Thank you for your flexibility. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair here has done the previous question is ordered. Is there an objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair has done the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted. All members voted. If so, the clerk will unlock the machine. On the passage of the bill, all the yeas were 169, the nays 2. The bill, having receded requisite, constitutional majority is therefore passed. Members, we're going to call a bill that we postponed from yesterday. We're going to call SB 135. It was on the calendar yesterday and was postponed until today. Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption to Senate Bill 135 135? Senate Bill 135, Senator Karpatrick, in the 30 second, annulles to be titled an act to amend our 3H after 7, the title 19 of the fiscal to Georgia annotated a relating to determination of paternity. So it's the line evidentiary medical and genetic testing with the uniform parentage act of 2017. This bill ever referred to the Committee on Juvenile Justice. The Committee recommends this bill do pass. Chair Lady, Chair Lady Ballinger is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I come before you to present Senate Bill 135. Senate Bill 135 clarifies the genetic testing. When genetic testing is required by court order, the testing must be of a type reasonably relied upon by the experts in the field and conducted by laboratory accredited by either the AA BB, formerly known as the American Association of Blood Banks or in accrediting body designated by the US Department of Health and Human Services. Results of genetic testing, including statistical likelihood of the alleged parent's parentage, are admitted into evidence without foundational testimony or other proof of accuracy unless a party of Jackson writing, at least 30 days prior to a hearing at which the results may be introduced as evidence. The bill makes results of required genetic testing self-authenticating and admissible in any civil action as long as documentation from the laboratory contains the following chain of custody information, the name and photograph of each individual who was tested, the name of the individual who collected the test result, the place and date each result was collected, the name of the person who received the result in the laboratory and the date the result was received. So, it's hopeful that by making these DNA tests during the course of a legitimation, sometimes that scientific proof of paternity is needed to move forward with legitimation. So, hopefully this will ameliorate that situation and make it move much faster for those children can get into permanent situations a lot quicker without holding up the process waiting on a genetic test. I'll be happy to stand for any questions. Lady, you have a question? Yes, sir. Representative Jasmine Clark to your left has a question. Thank you, Mr. Cedar. Speaker, does the general let you yield? I do. So, can you clarify on lines 48 and 49? You said that these genetic tests, so I'm going to say paternity tests, can be admitted without the need for proof of authenticity unless someone objects. So, it doesn't need to have proof of authenticity unless there's an objection to it. The results of the genetic testing can be admitted into court if it contains lines 60 through 64. If it has all of those procedures included, it's much like a medical narrative can be included and not have the actual doctor there to testify. So, sometimes having an actual geneticist who may be out of state come and testify to authenticate that kind of snags at the system. So, this just allows it to be self-authenticating unless the other party objects. Thank you. I'll be happy to yield to any more questions. No further questions. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I encourage everybody to vote favorably for Senate Bill 135. Thank you very much. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Thank you. Have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill. The yeas were 171, the nay zero. The bill having receded requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. We're going to move on to afternoon orders in the morning. Representative Kenner, you're recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I wanted to underscore a couple of things I said yesterday in the well to be more clear because they are powerful. We know that if a kid is reading on level by third grade, we've all but removed them from the possibility of corrections. We also know that studies show that four-year-olds going through our state pre-K are largely hitting that third grade proficiency marker. We know that four-year degree holders are virtually nonexistent in our prison population. It's clear our best public safety policy would be better education policy and it's much cheaper. It costs $5,400 to put a four-year-old through a pre-K. The average tuition costs for a four-year degree in Georgia is $20,000. Jucks to pose that to the cost to incarcerate an individual which is $27,000 per year and the average time served is five years. That's $135,000 to incarcerate. We know that we are sitting on $1.9 billion of lottery reserves, $1.1 billion in which we have access to now. We could deploy a fraction of that and put every Georgia four-year-old through pre-K and open up hope scholarships to thousands of thousands more for a four-year degree. This is good public safety policy. Doubling down on tough on crime measures doesn't work and it's really expensive. Right now we have more jails and prisons than we have colleges and universities in the state. When we fail to properly educate, we incarcerate. Victor Hugo said he who opens a school door closes a prison. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Representative Hutchinson is recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, today I want to introduce you to a sibling group. We have Timerie, who is 11, Tamaya, who is 10, Raman, who is 8, and Josiah, who is 7. This is a sibling group who are affectionate, love school, love to ride the bus to school, and are friendly. They love to watch TV, they get along with each other, and they like to cuddle with stuffed animals and blankets. This sibling group is very difficult to place. It's a sibling group of four and they are African-American children who are the most difficult to place. I don't think many people know that there is adoption assistance for families who decide to adopt a sibling group like this, or a special needs child or a sibling group. I hope when we consider children for adoption that we think about what supports our state gives, such as Medicaid and financial assistance, when you are taking on such a huge responsibility. Let's talk to our constituents to get these babies adopted. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Representative Buckner is recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, in the House, I really had planned to do this yesterday and kind of got bumped, but I just wanted to thank everyone for your well wishes, thoughts, and prayers when I was out last week, sick, and as a retired public health educator, I feel like it's important to say I had nothing contagious so you don't have to worry. I also think that as a retired health educator, these next few days of stress, I would encourage us all to get as much stress relief that we can by arresting and drinking plenty of water. Hopefully we'll get through to the end of Sinai Dow without any more illnesses, but thank you. You are truly a wonderful family and taking care of one of its own when I wouldn't feel so great. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Chairman, we'd our is recognized for an afternoon order. Good afternoon, colleagues.
