  "transcript": "Well good morning. Friday morning last day of the work week. Unless it extends in the Saturday. I'm not sure about that. All members, all members, all members please come to the floor. All members. Very good. Well good morning members, big calls. We're all good morning members because a good Friday, I think it's day 40 last I checked, which I've been looking for this one for a day or two. Because we know that the hour for competing having arrived, all members will please take their seats. Mr. Clerk, will you ring the bell? Well, good morning again. We're going to have the morning roll call. Morning roll call. All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines? All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machines? Well, good Friday morning again. Doorkeepers, will you please close the doors and keep them closed? As is our custom here in the house, we will begin our day with Scripture reading and prayer by our chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Good morning, I have the great honor and distinction to bring you our chaplain of the day. He's my pastor, Jay Williams. Jay is accompanied by some very important people in his life. And they're sitting right here, right down to my right. One of his daughters, he has two daughters. One of them is paging today and y'all will see Annabelle. She's a beautiful young lady. She'll be here. No, there she is right there. I'm sorry. She joined the sunflower, Annabelle. I hadn't seen you this morning. But the other light of his life is sitting with Miss Dale, as a young lady named Lily Grace. Two other important ladies are with him. One of them assures that his life goes pretty smoothly. And that's his mother-in-law. Molly Scott. Thank you, Molly, for being here. But his dear wife and one of the leaders in our church is his wife, Mindy. A health care professional who takes care of many folks up at Scroving County Health Systems in Sylvania, but also as a caretaker of many folks, slides spiritually and physically in our church, down at Misba, down in the Clio community down in Northern F and Him County. Let me tell you about our pastor today. He actually grew up with Chairman Matt Hatchett. He turned out pretty good in spite of that. But he and Matt were pretty close neighbors down in Dublin when they grew up. I'll tell you a lot about Jay from the standpoint of his service over the years. And in the South Georgia Conference, and now with us at Misba, he served with distinction, he served with passion, and compassion to his flock. He's been a teacher in the public school system, but he's been a leader in God's house his entire life. Like many of us, he's had a time or two getting started, and he had to get the right direction, but he's accomplished that, and he's made a difference in his own life and his family's life, and in many, many other people's lives. My family, that have attended this 159-year-old church. No, I haven't been there all 159 years. Thank you very much, Al. But he's made a difference in our church. He's grown our church. He brings God's Word, and that's what it's all about. So without further ado, my pastor, Pastor Jay Williams, that's our chapter of the day. Jay? Thank you. And the distinguished representatives of this beautiful state of Georgia. I want to begin by telling you, thank you so much. It's an immense honor to be before you today in this place, and at this time. I also want to express a deep gratitude for all that you do here. I can't even begin to fathom what you've juggle to serve our state, or your personal sacrifices that you give to be here. Jay, understand the basics of the legislative process, but the entirety of the experience, the weight of it, it's astounding to consider. You serve the great state of Georgia in your district, and all matters, as it applies to state and government. Now, I know what that really means is you have thousands of people telling you what they want you to do, and you can't please them all. You also live in a fishbowl. You live in the under the scrutiny of the press, your peers, and the truth of the matter is, is none of us are perfect. You face acceptance, rejection, and conflicting ideas every day, and you shoulder all that while still managing the business of this state. And on top of that, you have the complexity of your own lives, your own internal struggles, your own family lives. It's a greater undertaking than anyone can understand at just a casual glance that being said, it's important to have a 40-day session, and more importantly, it's important to have an ending day of a 40-day session. So just like that, I want to tell you this, it's important because this is an all-consuming job. And if you didn't have a 40-day session, there's no telling where we may end up. I will just like here, the number 40 is significant. There are many 40-day periods that are mentioned in Scripture. There are usually periods of trial, testing, and preparation. Let's look at some of them. Know about the grace of God endured the flood for 40 days. Moses was on the mountain top, receiving the law for 40 days. And Jesus was in the desert, tempted by Satan for 40 days. And Jesus was after his resurrection, and after his crucifixion, death, and resurrection, he walked the earth and before sending into heaven, he walked the earth for 40 days. I'm sure some of you can relate. Some of you like Noah having endured a flood of challenges over the past 40 days. Although it's not quite over, the dove is up. Some of you like Moses have been on the mountain top, and you've received your legislation, and the people didn't quite respond the way you wanted them to. Some of you feel like you've literally been in the desert with the same guy that Jesus was. I pray that you pass the test, and that you didn't give into his trap. And some of you are simply waiting for the end of day 40, so you can go to that little place of heaven called home. This is what I want to say to you today on this final day, that there's hope in this session, and there's hope in the signy die. There's hope in the end, and they ended the 40, and they're adjourning. There's hope in the remainder of this day, and the possibilities that it holds, and there's hope in the promise rest in its end. I can't begin to understand the weariness that comes from your schedule. The pressures de pleas the masses, and the looming thread of being replaced if you don't. And then there's the necessity of staying true to what you know as right in the process. It's in this complex context that our state brings its problems to you. While you have protocols to address these problems, what about the ones that are too big for even this house? The ones that are beyond your reach with implications that are far too heavy to bear, yet the decisions still have to be made. And what of your own burdens, the ones that are too heavy to carry alone? An old hymn comes to mind. There is a place of quiet rest, near to the heart of God. Scripture says it like this, Jesus said, Come to me all you who are weak and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Forty is the number of days in this session, but forties also a metaphor for life. It's a time of trial and testing and preparation. There's a promise for those that will respond to Christ's offer. We don't have to face it alone. There's one greater in whom we can rest. The promise is that if we walk with Him, we can have internal rest during the session. And at the end of it, we can have ultimate rest in our own personal, signy die. As we move through today and toward the close of this session, I say, Thank you so much for the work that you've done and the work that you're still doing. I invite you to find peace in knowing that you're not alone in this journey. Whether you carry the burdens of this state or your own personal burdens, there's an invitation to pause. An invitation to respond to Jesus is called a rest and someone that is trustworthy, someone that is greater than us, someone that is greater than our circumstances, to rest in the one who holds it all together and let Him direct and care you throughout this day. Again, I thank you for all that you do and all that you endure for this state. I pray that as you find rest in the nearness of God that you do so in this final session, I also pray that you do it in your lives out beyond this session. I pray that you're blessed in the journey, most immediately in the journey of this session, but more importantly, as you prepare for your ultimate and final home going. There's hope in the session and hope in the signy die. Thank you so much for the opportunity to speak here today and thank you for the chance to share the truth of God's Word and for the privilege of proclaiming the hope that's found in the name of Jesus. I pray that you rest in it in the rest of this session and also in the signy die. Let's pray. Father, as I stand before these people in my heart, it's heavy. Father, they have worked so hard. They have done their best, Father God, to please their constituents, Father, and to do what's right. And Father God, I know it's a huge job. I pray today that as they go through this marathon day, Lord, that you're in the middle of it. And Father God, that you anoint them to walk in peace and love with one another, and Father, I pray that you will be done. Father God, I thank you so much for the fact that you put them in the place that they're in today. Father, use them for your glory. Father God, and for the betterment of this state. Father God, thank you for their leadership. I pray you bless them in Jesus' name. Amen. Please join me in the pledge of leading. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which stands one nation that God has been visible, who liberty and justice for all. Excellent. Well, folks, I was a little concerned there, the preacher in Boach, signy, die several times. I'm glad you didn't have the papers ready to go. We'd have been out of here. Jay, thank you, and family, Mendy, and family. Thank you for being here. It's a four-hour drive up here, so we appreciate you all making this commitment. Doorkeeper, you may unlock the doors.

If you have ever attended an Atlanta Hawks game. I know you were up out your seat on that dancing meter. I know you were having a good time. And that is probably because of Mr. Hanky.

We want to ask you to stand and ask you to continue doing the work that you are doing in this competitive music industry here in Georgia. We honor you and we celebrate you today.

Thanks for what you're doing in the community as well. Thank you. Thank you. Members, we're going to take up some agrees. And maybe even some disagrees. Representative Bruce Williamson has recognized for a motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move that the House accept the Senate substitute to House Bill 586. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? House Bill 586 to be tied to a men article 3, chapter 6, title 48. I believe if you go to Georgia and Tady will lay the intangible recording tax, so as to revise the note for which such taxes imposed. Chairman Williamson has recognized to explain this Senate substitute to House Bill 586. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, if you recall House Bill 586, simply let me back up a second. So right now under the current Georgia code, if you borrow money, you're secured by a deed to secure debt for over three years, there's a $3 per thousand recording tax. This bill simply moves that exemption period from three years up to 62 months, which is five years and two months. The happy to answer any questions, if not, Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the will. Jim has no questions. Thank you. All the gentlemen's motion that the House agree to the Senate substitute to House Bill 586, House Bill 586, all those in favor. But yes, those opposed. We'll vote no in, Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines? Have all members voted? All members voted if so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? All in the gentleman's motion, the yeas are 161, the days are zero, and this House has agreed to the Senate substitute to House Bill 586. Chairman Rees is recognized for motion, gentlemen, excuse me, representative Rees, I'll give you a promotion. Thank you, Speaker Burns. I move to agree to the Senate substitute for House Bill 131. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? House 131 to be entitled, act to amend Article 5 of Chapter 4, title 10 of the fiscal to George Anitetti relating to self-service storage facilities. Representative Rees is recognized to explain the Senate substitute to House Bill 131. Thank you, Speaker Burns. House Bill 131 unanimously passed the House. This bill brings the self-storey industry in line with 30 other states. There were some articulate business women who came in and represented the 15 self-storey units. The Senate Committee made a minor amendment pertaining to boats and RVs and campers and vehicles that are sometimes at storage units. That's it. That is the only change. It was grievelled all parties involved. Now it would request your favorable support. You have a couple of questions if you'll take them. I will, Mr. Speaker. My nori leader, Hugh Gleet, to your left out front is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? To the leader I do. Thank you so much. I've got a concern that was sent to me in the true that if three independent bidders attend the sale at the time and place advertised, it's need to be commercially reasonable. Is that still in this bill? It is. The three bidders that was that is longstanding law. The sale cannot be finalized until you have at least three bidders. Also, all of the notice provisions, the due process, to the delinquent customer, those are not changed whatsoever in this bill. This bill merely adjusts the advertisement procedures to bring in line with 30 other states. And what is the advertisement requirement if you don't mind? To commercially reasonable so you can run a newspaper ad, you can run online, you can do social media, you can do advertising through placing signs out there for regular sales. So there are a variety of ways it's done, but they've got to get at least three bidders for the sales. Mr. Speaker, if there are. Mr. Speaker, if there are. Rimsley Park, Kenon. Mr. Rick and I have a little question. All right. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Do you yield? To the representative I do. Thank you. What impact does this have on urban business owners? It has a positive impact on urban business owners as well as the customers of self-storage, because this outdated procedure that Georgia has on the ads, if you have a delinquency in a unit, it delays filling that unit up to a paying customer. And also if you think about the customers of self-storage, you have senior citizens, people who have gone through to divorce, students, other people who are on the move, and this red tape that we've got in this area that 30 other states have improved on, that will save money if we change it to bring it into national standards. It's good for consumers. Thank you. Rimsley, if you have Lisa Campbell's recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? To the representative I do. Thank you. I just wanted to clarify, it looks like one other change to me online, 116, that the notice of advertisement actually has been reduced to once versus once for two weeks. Correct. Absolutely. And that is something to clarify for boats, RVs, vehicles, things like that that you've got to give notice for. There still is a newspaper ad required one time. Thank you. Thank you. Gentlemen, has there further questions? Are you the well? Jim was you the well. On the gentleman's motion, the House agreed to the Senate's substitute, the House Bill 131. All those in favor will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machines. Mr. Speaker, I request to be excused from this vote according to rule 133. The gentleman has that right and the gentleman will so reflect, have all members voted, all members voted if so, Mr. Clerk, where you lock the machine. All the gentleman's motion, the yeas are 163, the nays 1, the House has agreed to the Senate's substitute, the House Bill 131. Representative Rob Leveritt is recognized for a motion. Chairman Leveritt. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I was hoping to have the cheat sheet up there on the screen, but I believe what I'm doing is moving to a greater the Senate's substitute, the House Bill 36. Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption, House Bill 36, correct? House Bill 36 to be entitled, an act of entitled 29 of the Fisher go to George Antony, related to guardian and ward, so as to revise the list of providers who are authorized to participate in the processes for appointment of a guardian for an adult. We're representative Leveritt has recognized to explain his motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the bill that would add a number of professions to the list of those that can provide an evaluation in a guardianship or a conservatorship proceeding. You remember there was a lot of drama on the floor as the representative Evans-I had an interesting exchange on this bill. I believe House Media Service is going to set that video to doling banjos to make a good soundtrack with it, but I believe I've addressed all of her concerns. What I have done is added provisions that make it clear that the proposed ward, that is the person who would be the subject of the guardianship or conservatorship, can at any time challenge the qualifications, experience, or manner of the performance of the evaluation during the hearing or at the outset of the proceeding to stop it from going forward. Additionally, for the Council on Developmental Disabilities, we added some language that made it clear that developmental disability itself is not a reason for granting a guardianship. And finally, in the Senate they made an amendment that removed marriage and family therapists from the list of those who can do the evaluation, so that profession is no longer included in the bill. We believe this is essential legislation. We really want to get it passed this year so that the backlogs in these cases can be addressed, and the appropriate judges can find qualified people who perform these evaluations, so I'd ask for your favorable consideration in the bill. Gentlemen, you, yes, Representative Evans, Stacey Evans, so your left is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, I do. Isn't it true that I really appreciate you working with me and us being able to work through some changes to make this bill better? I would hope that's the case because that's certainly how I feel. I appreciate your engaging on it with me. Thank you. Will you yield for one more? Yes ma'am. Isn't it also true that throughout this process, I think we've both learned, or at least I have learned, that our probate judges need a lot more support from us and help, and I look forward to working in the off season to try to help their job be a little bit easier for the citizens of Georgia. The lady knows of what she speaks, and I look forward to that collaboration also. Thank you. Thank you. Representative Park Cannon, thank you. Does lady have a question? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Do you yield? Yes ma'am. Thank you for this legislation. Would you agree that this does not expand the scope of practice of a nurse practitioner, but it does recognize their expertise? Absolutely. That is precisely correct. Thank you for that question. General Houser for the question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I ask your favor, support of the motion with the guard to the House Bill 36. On the gentleman's motion, that House agree to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 36, all those in favorable vote? Yes, those opposed? We vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines? All the gentlemen's motion, the yeas are 165, the nays are two. This House has agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 36. Representative Leverd has recognized for motion. Hello again, Mr. Speaker. I'll move that the House agree to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 37. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? Yes. House Bill 37 to be entitled, and act to amend subpar 2, part 6 of Article 6 of Chapter 2, titled 20, the physical to Georgia, and to relate to conditions of employment in elementary and secondary education. Chairman Leverd has recognized to explain his motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, this was the bill from last year that we try to get this year that simply requires school districts to provide notice to employees concerning whether self-security is being withheld. Because as you may recall from the initial discussion, school districts are not required to participate. Some of them do, some of them don't. There's different practice across the state. We're trying to make sure that our school district employees aren't met with any unpleasant surprises upon retirement. Over in the Senate, they did make one change. They added a provision concerning that is not mandatory. It just authorizes school districts who are providing insurance to their board members that they can also provide family coverage to those board members, you know, under whatever terms, requiring the family to pay in or the board member to pay also. It's not mandatory. It's simply permissive, and it's intended to provide statutory authorization for a practice that's already in existence. So we're fine without amendment. I will ask you to support the motion. Gentlemen, answer your question. Gentlemen, has a question or two represented to Barry of the center aisle just to your left. Gentlemen, recognize. Thank you. Does the gentleman, thank you for speaking to the gentleman you? Yes, sir. Is this done anywhere else in the country? It's kind of beer credit, got burden of reporting every five years that they're anywhere else in this country, or is this just the first nation trying to be injured? I'm sorry. I cannot understand the question. Was this, is this kind of law done anywhere else in this country, or is this just a Georgia-specific issue? I'm not aware that other states have the original law that was in the original bill. This was, I guess, this is our innovation. Okay. Thank you. We're up to the board now. To your left is also a recognizable question. Ladies recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. That's gentleman you. Yes, ma'am. Now, when would they have to let the employees know? Well, the bill is, tries to be fairly specific. Upon hiring, they have to be notified whether the school district is going to be withholding. If they do not, they have to notify the employee of some other available plans that would provide, you know, sort of a replacement, if you will, for security, additional retirement plans. Then they've got to give them notice periodically through employment every five years. And then at termination, they have to say whether they withhold or not. Thank you. So we're hoping they'll get the message of this one. Gentlemen, you for one more historical question. Gentlemen, was there when they created Social Security to your left. Representative Williams has recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And I appreciate you letting me in the door when I got there. Appreciate it. Well, the gentleman yielded. Yes, sir. Is it not true, then? Over the last 20 or 30 years, though there was some initial resistance, minimum tide teachers are very glad that they signed up for Social Security because those that didn't left a lot of money on the table. I'm sure that's the case. Thank you for the question. Gentlemen, has there further question? And that gentleman knows of what he speaks to just ask that question, for sure. I want a serious note. Yes. Mr. Speaker, I just asked the body's fate. Will consideration all yield the well? Gentlemen, is yielded the well. All the gentleman's motion that the House agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 37. All those in favor will vote yes.

Representative Fleming has recognized for a motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move that the House agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 150. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? House Bill 150 to be entitled to amend part two of Article 2, Chapter 3, Title 20, the official code of George Ants and Arlaying the University System. So, sir.\n\nOur report quarterly reports regarding certain funding received from individuals or entities related to China. Representative Flamie is recognized to explain the amendment. Thank you Mr. Speaker. As y'all recall House members, HP 150 deals with funding that comes from foreign countries of concern to our higher education institutions. Requires institutions to report to this body, the Senate and the governor, what those funds are and where they come from. In the Senate, they changed the reporting dates from quarterly to twice a year to align with other reporting that the USG system schools have and set the cap at $1,000 for any contribution of $1,000 be reported and explain for what those dollars are for. This to remind y'all this does not pertain to any tuition from individuals from these countries is just other funding. And with that Mr. Speaker, I have you taking questions or I'll yield the will. Gentlemen's has a couple questions for you. You'll yield. Yes. We'll park right in front of it to your left. It's recognized for a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Does gentleman yield? Yes sir. Is it not true that I am concerned about the Senate amendment that reduces the amount from 50,000 to 1,000 precisely because in committee we were talking about the burden this would put on our USG, TCSG institutions in which case due to this amendment I would encourage all members to vote no. Is that not true? I know you're concerned. Yes sir. Thank you. Gentlemen, you will rip the remind up to Senator Al to your on the left. Just a quick last request. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Is it a gentleman yield? Yes sir. Is it you know one thing that we have been discussing about this bill is my concern that when we keep our focus so narrow we might actually miss the force for the trees. In this particular instance by only focusing on a few countries we actually don't have an idea of where any other foreign investments might be coming from and that my hope is that bills like this would be more broad to actually deal with the issue at hand here. Yes, lady not to discuss that. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the will. The Rep. Jasmine Clark was recognized for a question already had her button pushed if you don't mind. Yes sir. Ladies recognize. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Is it gentleman yield? Yes ma'am. I guess to add on to the question asked by my colleague with Park what was the Senate's reasoning for decreasing the cap from 50,000 which we thought was reasonable because it would not be as burdensome to our USG systems to the 1,000 which could probably trigger a lot of work administrative work for someone in USG. Or if you recall my original bill that was in committee we didn't have any cap on it. It was zero cap so it had been any any figure coming from any funding coming would be happy reported. I'm not so sure what they're reasoning for but my original bill had had no cap on it. Thank you. Jim has no further questions. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I ask for your favorable consideration for Hp 150. Thank you. Thank you for your explanation.

Members, this is a simple amendment that the Senate add on to the on 156, 156 voted out 162 to 7. The Senate as amended voted out 53 to 0. The base bill effectively put bird reports into the code.

My motion is to agree to the Senate amendment for HV308. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? House bill 308 to be entitled to amend Title 40. The Fish and Co. to Georgia Antony relating motor vehicles and traffic. So, as a review for the operation of miniature on-road vehicles on certain highways. Representative Cliff, who is recognized to explain the Senate amendment. Jim was recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, we're back with the mini-truck bill. The Senate, and it's all of its wisdom, decided to add a few pieces to this bill. The first is current law states that if you are caught road racing or, I believe they called it, doing donuts, reckless driving. Law currently allows your vehicle to be impounded permanently or crushed. This amendment, however, allows the judge's discretion to add a governor device to your car that limits you to only 20% over the current speed limit. The other amendment in here is a representative's amendment from our bill earlier that allows it for when people are pulled over for speeding, for a de-escalation aspect of the law to not have to sign the ticket. They will put on their refusal to sign, and that is the general of the amendment. The gentleman has a couple of questions if you are yielded. Yes, sir. I will yield for one question. Chairman Parsons was first to your left. Is the gentleman asked for a question. Thanks, Speaker. Is the gentleman yielded? Yes, sir. I would just like to ask, I think he said to one of the changes they made to the Senate, was they had a provision that a driver could add a go-der device to his car. Is that correct? The judge's discretion instead of having their car impounded permanently or again crushed and destroyed, they can have a governor added to it so that they can get their car back but will be limited to the speed that they can drive. Would you further yield? Yes, sir. I'm just curious, is it true? How available or what kind of process do you have to go through to get a governor? I've never looked for one, but are they readily available? Are they very expensive? I'm not aware, but I do believe that anything would be better than having your car lost forever. If the cost of the product is more expensive than the car itself, you're more than welcome to decline and have your car taken away from you. But this is just another option in order for people to keep their car instead of having it taken away. I would just...is it true? It just seemed like before we vote on something, we should know what kind of expensive it would add to somebody in case that they did have to or if it made some kind of a problem for a family or whatever. There's not just the individual or his individual family, but his parents and grandparents have to pay for these things. It's not true. Thank you. Yes, sir. Jim, will you yield one more question? I think I can get the answer to that question. Yes, sir. I'll probably yield one more question. Will the representative, Jason Ridley, have some experience here limiting his speed. I think he might know how much it costs. Jim, would you recognize for a question? Is Jim when you yield? Yes, sir. Is it not true that the device is a new device that just came out almost kind of like the one that they do on a DUI where you do a breathalyzer. But what this right here does is it's attached your car and it's a couple hundred dollars a month that most and what that does is the judge could make you make you have it on there for three to six months and then you can be able to keep your car and be able to get back to the port to work. Absolutely. Again, this is an alternative instead of having your car gone forever and never having it back. This is alternative to being able to keep your car and drive a limit speed limit.
