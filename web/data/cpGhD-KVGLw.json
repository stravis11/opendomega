  "transcript": "All members will please report to their seats on the floor of the chamber in the gallery\nand in room 341.\nAll members will please report to the House of Representatives.\nthe clerk will ring the bell.\nAll members will please take their seats.\nWe are about to have the morning roll call.\nWe're about to have the morning roll call.\nAll members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber and\nthe clerk will unlock the machines.\nhave all members voted, have all members voted, if so the clerk will lock the\nmachines. Well good morning. Welcome back. You may notice that we have a number of\nexcused members on the board and they are out for various reasons. They are not\nall out and I want to repeat that. They are not all out because they've tested\npositive for COVID. So I don't want their rumors to not that there would ever\ndevelop a rumor in this building. But I don't want a rumor out there that\nthere's been an outbreak in the house because there certainly has not been and\nmany of these members will be present tomorrow. I want to remind all the\nmembers too before we begin of the testing policy that has been repeated\ndistributed amongst the membership of the house, the dates and the requirement that you\nbe tested by Georgia Tech and the protocol for the testing.\nYou know, that's not there to make you happy or make you feel good, but it's there to\ntake care of your members, your colleagues.\nSo we've had some concerns about why people have to test in that fashion.\nWell, I'm not trying to make anybody happy about the testing except I'm trying to keep\neverybody well and I'm going to keep doing that.\nSo, doorkeepers will please close the doors and keep them closed.\nBefore we begin today, I know there's a lot of prayer needs and a lot of people back home\naround us that are suffering from COVID, but I want to point out that we have had two\nmembers that have been informed about this morning that they have lost their parents\nAnd Representative Roba Show and Representative Dunahoo and let's keep them close in our prayers.\nThat's a pain like no other.\nWe will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain after which we will\npledge allegiance to the flag of our country.\nOur chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 178th House District\nRepresentative Stephen Meeks, Representative Meeks.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nGood morning.\nWhat a beautiful day it has turned out to be after a very stormy morning, Hatton.\nToday it is my honor to introduce someone who is no stranger to this house, as he has\nserved as chaplain of the day in previous sessions.\nAnd colleagues are in for a treat because the messages that he brings are always\nbiblically true, always timely, and always needed. A dynamic speaker, he's a leader, a servant,\nand a true man of God. Brother Mike Stone is a native of Valdosta, Georgia, and a graduate\nof Valdosta State College, as he said this morning before, it was Valdosta State University.\nHe was first called as Minister of Music at a Manual Baptist Church 25 years ago.\nHe has served as Senior Pastor for 19 of those 25 years.\nFor many years he has served as the chaplain for the Pierce County Bear Football Team, which\nare also the 2023 state football champions. He has served the Georgia Bible's convention\nas preaching conference president, as chairman of the executive committee, and convention\npresident. He has also served at the national level on the resolutions committee, and the\nimmediate past chairman of the executive committee of the Southern Baptist Convention.\nMost recently, ladies and gentlemen, he has announced his\ncannot see for President of the Southern Baptist Convention,\nwhich would take place, the lecture would take place later\nthis year in Tennessee.\nHe has daddy to four wonderful children and husband\nto Andrea.\nI'm privileged to sit under his teachings every week.\nHe's a man of God who unapologetically teaches the word of God.\nPlease help me in welcoming my pastor, Mike Stone.\nWhat is indeed a privilege to be here, I have great respect for this house and those who\nserve the great people of the state of Georgia in your ministry here.\nThe Bible declares in the book of Romans that those who serve in seats of government are\nministers of God for the good of those who are under their authority.\nSo though our ministries are different and varied, we are all ministers of the Lord,\nand it is a privilege to be in this place today.\nI was reminded on several occasions of the tightness of your schedule and those frequent\nreminders reminded me of the story of the young seminary student preparing for the ministry\nand he went out as a student to preach one Sunday as a guest preacher.\nHe asked his preaching professor, do you have a word of advice?\nThe professor said, I don't have a word, I have five words of advice and they are these.\nBe brief, brother.\nBe brief.\nI do want to be mindful of your busy schedule,\nbut I've titled my brief comments today,\nmy prayer for you.\nAnd the text for the day is drawn\nfrom Paul's first letter to Timothy,\nchapter two, beginning in the first verse.\nThe word of God says,\nfirst of all, then I urge that in treaties\nand prayers, petitions and thanksgiving\nbe made on behalf of all men for kings\nand all who are in authority,\nso that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life\nand all godliness and dignity.\nthis is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior who desires all men to be saved\nand to come to the knowledge of the truth.\nIt was reported that when Reverend Edward Everett Hale was serving as chaplain of the\nU.S. Senate, someone asked him if he looked at the nation and prayed for the senators and\nhe quipped, no, I look at the senators and I pray for the nation.\nThe reality is regardless of what position or party or principles you may have, your position\nas members of this great assembly warrant the prayers of the people of God.\nThere are not many things that I can say I know for a fact or the will of God for your\nlife, but the Bible says it is the will of God that we pray for those who are in authority\nabove us.\nAnd the prophet Samuel declared in 1 Samuel 12-23, God forbid that I should sin against\nGod by ceasing to pray for you and so my devotional word this morning again\nsimply entitled my prayer for you. And I just want to mention three simple things\nthat will be the centerpiece of the prayers that I will pray as God lays the\nmembers of this body on my heart today and in the days ahead. First of all I\npray for your protection. I pray for your protection. I've attended this\nThis assembly on many occasions, as a guest in the gallery, on several of the past occasions,\nis Chaplain of the Day, but this is the first time that I recall seeing the type of armed\nprotection out in the streets, and of course we come through the metal detectors and this\nbuilding and all who enter here are protected by law enforcement and we thank God for that.\nFrom the violet riots that swept the country last summer to the tragic events and deaths\nthat occurred earlier this month in the nation's capital, we've been reminded in vibrant living\ncolor that our country can be a violent and dangerous place.\nAnd so we should thank God that in our country we don't change our leaders with bullets,\nbut we are blessed to be able to change them with ballots.\nWhether it's the Georgia State Patrol, the National Guard, the local police, the Sheriff's\nDepartment, or the many brave men and women who protect this building and all who enter\nit.\nfrom God. And I thank the Lord for them today as I pray for your protection. This\nwas really on the heart of one of our forefathers who wrote in a tremendous\nhymn, our Father's God to thee, author of liberty to thee we sing. Long may our\nland be bright with freedom's holy light, protect us by thy might, great God,\nour King. And I'm aware some 127 declares that unless the Lord guards the\ncity, the watchman stays awake in vain. And my prayer for your protection is that the only\nbarbs that would fly in these hallowed halls would be those verbal flaws that are the\nproduct of healthy debate. I heard about two senators who came from farming districts\nand they were arguing over an appropriations bill. One of them was a staunch liberal from\nan economic perspective and the other was a staunch conservative and the conservative\nfarming legislator said to his liberal colleague, he said, I don't understand your economic\npolicy, you want to give my hard earnings to someone who hasn't worked for it.\nAnd the liberal legislator said, well, that's just what I believe.\nAnd the conservative said, you mean if you had two farms that you had worked for and I had\nnot worked to earn one, you'd give me one of your two farms, he said, I sure would.\nHe said, you mean if you had two silos that you had worked hard to earn and I did not,\nYou would give me one of those, and the liberal legislator said, I sure would.\nHe said, well, I don't understand.\nYou mean if you had two giant combines that you had worked hard to earn, and I didn't have\none because I didn't work, you'd give me one of those two combines.\nHe said, I sure would.\nHe said, let me get this straight.\nYou mean if you had two cows that you had worked for to pay, and I didn't have one, you'd\ngive me one of those two cows, and the liberal said, well, that's not fair.\nYou know I have two cows.\nI pray that attempt that humor does not offend you, but I say it to simply say this.\nIf that does offend you, I pray that that is the worst thing that ever happens to you.\nAs you serve the citizens of the state of Georgia, I pray for your protection.\nQuickly now, secondly, I pray for your wisdom.\nThe Bible says in the book of James, if any man lacks wisdom, let him ask God and God\nwill grant it with liberality.\nSome decisions are easy in the home, in the community, in the workplace, and in this assembly.\nSome are as plain as can be.\nYou've already made up your mind.\nYou have these convictions.\nYou have your preferences and your stands.\nBut sometimes there are decisions we have to make for which there is no clear cut answer.\nThat does not mean that there isn't a right answer or a wrong answer.\nIt just means the right answer is not always an obvious answer.\nIn my ministry, I've been blessed as Representative Meek said, I have served as the chairman of\nthe board for the Georgia Baptist Mission Board, which has millions and millions of dollars\nin assets, an early 40 million dollar budget this year, the recent, the immediate past chairman\nof the executive committee of the Southern Baptist Convention, which has billions of dollars\nin assets and have served as presidents and chairman of these respective boards.\nI pastor a church in South Georgia that has a multi-million dollar annual budget, but\nI do not mind telling you that in the last ten months, I have questioned my own ability\nto lead more than at any other time in my life and my ministry, because of this thing that\nseparates and distances us even in this building and causes us to wear masks, COVID-19 has\ncreated a lot of different challenges.\nNot prayer for you as it whether you face challenging decisions as a legislator, as a parent,\nor even as a child, caring for aging parents that you would understand the truth of Proverbs\n3, 5, and 6.\nTrust in the Lord with all your heart, lean not on your own understanding, but in all your\nways acknowledge Him and He shall direct your path.\nMy prayer for you is a prayer for protection, a prayer for your wisdom, finally a prayer\nfor your integrity.\nThe word integrity is based on the same root word as the word integrated and it means there\nis consistency that when we look or peer into any aspect of your life, we see the same man,\nwe see the same woman.\nMy prayer for you is that you would reject all counsel that violate spiritual principles\nand that you would resist the inevitable pressures of this place to lose your integrity.\nI pray that you would be the same person here as you are at home, the same person in\nthe hallway as you are on the floor, the same person in plenary session as you are in\ncommittee, the same person in committee as you were at supper the night before, the same\nperson in Atlanta as you are back home.\nI pray that there would be no secret life hidden agenda or private side of you that only\na handful of people really know about.\nFor the Bible says in Proverbs 20 verse 7 that the righteous man walks in his integrity\nand his children are blessed after him.\nSome years ago, preparing to preach my first funeral\nof veteran pastor gave me a little illustration.\nHe said, challenge the people at that funeral\nto live the kind of life,\nso that they can enjoy it while they're living it.\nAnd then when they get old,\nthey can sit on their front porch\nand look back on it and enjoy it a second time.\n25 years in the ministry now,\nI've added a third line to that great word of advice.\nLive your life in such a way\nso that you can enjoy it while you're living it.\nWhen you get old in retirement, you can look back on it and enjoy it a second time.\nAnd then when your children lay you in the arms of God, your sons and daughters and grandchildren\ncan look back on your life and enjoy it even a third time.\nThat is my prayer for you that our great God would protect you, give you wisdom and help\nyou walk in integrity.\nMay we pray together?\nOur Father in our God, we come to you the only way we can, the only way we know how, through\nthe blood and by the name of your Son and our Savior, the Lord Jesus.\nAnd I do pray without apology that you would protect the members of this house and all\nthose who would serve in positions of leadership.\nI pray that you would grant them wisdom not based on their knowledge or experience, but\nbased on a wisdom that can only come from you.\nAnd I do pray that they would walk in holiness, righteousness, blamelessness, and integrity\nfor the good of the citizens of their district, for the good of the residents of this wonderful\nstate, and for the ultimate honor and glory of Jesus Christ and whose name we make our\nprayer.\nAmen.\nA pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for\nwhich it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.\nDoorkeepers will unlock the doors.\nYou\nThe Chair recognizes Chairman Hogan, the Chair of the Committee on Information and Audits.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nYour Committee on Information and Audits has read the journal of the previous legislative\nday and found it to be correct.\nFurthermore, Mr. Speaker, don't be distracted by criticism.\nRemember the only taste of success some people have is when they take a bite out of you.\nI'm going to remember that one just in case I ever get criticized, Mr. Chairman.\nChairman Hogan, the chair of the Committee on Information and Audits

I told him that night that I could not remember a time in my life that he was\nnot a part of my world, although we had never met. You know, growing up a baseball fan\nback in the 60s, we didn't have 20 games a night to choose from on TV. You got one on\nSaturday afternoon with Dizzy Dean and P.W. Reese doing the play by play and I can\nremember how excited I would be on those Saturday afternoons when they had the\nMilwaukee Braves on and I still remember the celebration in this city across\nGeorgia and indeed the entire southeast when it was announced that the\nThe braves were moving to Atlanta.\nBig League Baseball was coming to the South because at that time, if you wanted to clean\nclosest to home, you had to pull for the St. Louis Cardinals or the Washington Senators.\nWe all became Hank Aaron fans from Little League Fields to Cal Pastures all over.\nSome boys tried to imitate that looping, fluid swing, and the smooth, seemingly effortless\ncatch of a fly ball in the outfield.\nFor most of us, we didn't see a black man.\nWe saw a ball player, a baseball grade who was quietly becoming a legend, and he was\na legend who played for the Atlanta Braves, not the New York Yankees, not the Los Angeles\nDodgers, and not the Chicago Cubs, but Hank Aaron was ours.\nMost of us were oblivious to the struggles of Hank Aaron on the road to becoming a super\nstar until later.\nWe were not aware of the hate mail, the cat calls, and the various other forms of hostility\nwhich were heaped upon this man.\nBut we saw a man of quiet dignity and a goodness that caused him to suffer in silence.\nHank Aaron will be defined by April 8, 1974 when he made baseball and sports history in\nan iconic moment.\nBut he will also be defined as a sports star who quietly gave back to his community and\nwho demonstrated that grace and dignity mattered.\nAnd a man who just two weeks before his death was doing something as simple and heroic as\nadvocating for people to take the COVID vaccination.\nHe was a legend.\nAnd he was ours.\nBut through it all, he was a ball player.\nI know that Chairman Smiley wants to be heard, and I think that Chair is going to recognize\nhim next, and we'll have a little treat after his remarks.\nBut I think it would be appropriate, Madam Speaker, for us to reflect and with a moment of silence\non this life.\nThank you. I yield the well.\nChair recognizes the Dean of the House,\nRepresentative Smarring, for a morning order.\nGood morning, now.\nThe speaker and members of the House.\nBefore I make my remarks, I want to thank you, Mr. Speaker, for your leadership this morning\nand ensuring the safety of all the members of this house.\nYou know, Speaker alluded to this, but Hank Aaron died from natural causes, and I was\nwith him when we took the COVID-19 vaccination together. And I want to thank him for that.\nAnd on our tombstones, there will be two dates, the day that you're born and the day that\nyou pass away. It's not your birthday, which we celebrate, nor your passing date, which\nwe mourn that matters on your tombstone. What matters on your tombstone is what did you do with the\ndash? What would your dash say? Hank Aaron dash will say yes he was a Hall of Famer,\nyes he received the Stam usual lifetime award, yes he was a successful business person,\nbut I think the person that I know his dash will say that he was a given person.\nthat he was a compassionate person that he did not waver in his love for his family\nin his community, in his state, and his nation. So I joined Speaker Austin and other members\nthat have signed the resolution on commending him for his life and San DeBilla Aaron.\nI talked to a family representative last night and she says thank you Mr. Speaker for this\nrecognition this morning when I text the speaker over the weekend and told him how I felt\nabout this and he knew that we all loved Hank Aaron and I met Aaron about 30 years ago\nbut I said in Fortin County Stadium on April I was a young man running for public office\nin 1974, and I saw him hit 715 on April the 8th, 1974, in the upper, upper, upper, upper,\nupper, upper, upper, way up there, out, in the upper, up, needed binoculars to see him\nrun around the bases, but to, to Bill Aeron and to the Aeron family, I want you to know\nknow that this house stands with you during this difficult time.\nAnd I pray that God hold you close to his heart where he can feel and know your deepest\nlost and then feel you with his deepest love.\nSo Mr. Speaker, thank you for this resolution and on behalf of the Aaron family.\nWe thank all of you all.\nHank Aaron was a favorite son.\nHe was someone we saw as a sports person, but I see him as a walk-in living legend, an\nicon in our state and in our nation.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker, and I yield well.\nThrough it all, Henry Aaron persevered.\nHis pursuit of baseball's most cherished record continued, and on opening day of 1974, he took\nhis place alongside Babe Ruth.\nThree one-fifth, air to drive into one field.\nThat ball is going, going, and out of here.\nHenry Aaron has just tied.\nThey broke in the all-time home run parade.\nThe record they said that couldn't be reached\nhas just been reached by Henry Aaron.\nFour days later, Aaron and the Braves\nheaded home to Atlanta.\nGet up for me, man.\nGet up my way.\nOn April 8th, 1974, the Braves hosted the Dodgers in the first home game of the season,\nwith Aaron one swing away from surpassing the Sultan of Swat.\nSomeone told me later once it was cold, I didn't feel a thing.\nThey said it was drizzling, I didn't feel a thing.\nHank told me, you know, that what he's gonna do.\nHe said, I'm tired of this, I'm gonna get this over with right now.\nHere's the pitch by Downey Swinging.\nHere's the drive into left center field.\nThat ball is gonna be out of here.\nNext time, next time, next time, next time, next time.\nThere's a little home-right champion of all time\nat a Henry Aaron.\nYeah!\nYeah!\nYeah!\nYeah!\nYeah!\nYeah!\nYeah!\nI thought about you coming along, ways, baby.\nYou know what I mean?\nIt's from Mobile, Alabama, all the way\nto breaking one of the most prestigious record\nin baseball.\nI feel very proud of myself.\nI don't know how my mother ever got out of the stand,\nBut I guess she was bent on being out there,\nwhich was fine with me.\nBut she gave me the biggest, tightest hug I ever had in my life.\nI don't know how I got loose.\nHe had tears on his cheek and tears in his eyes.\nAnd I remember being stunned, I said, Henry Aaron is crying.\nWhat a marvelous moment for baseball.\nWhat a marvelous moment for Atlanta and the state of Georgia.\nWhat a marvelous moment for the country in the world.\nA black man is getting a standing ovation in the deep south\nfor breaking a record of an all-time baseball idol.\nNot just thank God, it's all over with.\nThank you very much.\nAt the time he called it quits, Aaron was second all-time\nin runs and hits, and had more home runs,\nRBI's, and total bases than anyone\nwho ever played the game,\ntribute to the remarkable quality and consistency of his career.\nThe way to fame is like the way to heaven through much tribulations.\nIt had been for me to quote a very popular song along in Wyndon Road.\nHe was a pillar of strength and if anybody black, white, red, or technical or has a problem\nyou can look at Henry Aaron.\nIt's a look at the strength he had.\nI think that people can look at me and say, you know, he was a great baseball player, but\nhe was even a greater human being.\nWe've got a few minutes left for morning orders and the chair recognizes Representative\nCarpenter for a morning order.\nyou speaker. I come before you today guys to show you the the rug for this\nsession. They're not in yet but they will be here in about a month and you'll\ncome by my office in 408 and we'll give it to you but it's a great rug. It shows\nthe carpet industry and it's support for Georgia grown and agriculture. So I'm\ngonna hold it up so everybody can see.\nSo of course I'll be dropping this one off in the speaker's office. I yield to\nwell. Always glad to get him. Chair recognizes the whip of the majority caucus,\nwhip Kelly for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I want to thank you\nfor your words this morning about the seriousness of the pandemic we're dealing\nwith, and the tragedy that our country is going through, our states going through, and\neach of our communities is going through.\nYou talk about us having to attend too many funerals, I agree, and last week, unfortunately,\nour community, the Rotmart community, the Polk County community, had to have a funeral\nfor one of our most beloved members, our city manager, Jeff Ellis of Rotmart, passed\non January the 15th, 2021.\nJeff was a public servant in every sense of the word.\nHe served as the chief of the Rotemart Fire Department\nfor 15 years, and then he served as city manager\nfor 25 more.\n40 years of public service to the Rotemart community.\nHe left his fingerprints all over the city of Rotemart\nin Polk County, from the recreation department\nto our 911 system to redoing City Hall.\nLeft behind from Jeff was his loving wife of 45 years,\nMr. Ginger, son, mate, his daughter, Jennifer,\nfive grand sons, and three great grandkids.\nI ask you, please join me in a moment of silence\nfor this great public servant.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker, and I'll yield the well.\nI understand he passed from COVID.\nChair recognizes representative Dunnohoor for a morning order.\nThank you, Speaker.\nIt could be a little tough, but this morning at 2 a.m., my father, Emory West, and a\nwhose senior went to me with our heavily father.\nBut one of the things, he was an avid hunter, an avid fisherman that passed that loved me.\nHe retired with Southern Bell after 35 years, and we spent a lot of time hunting and fishing\ntogether. But one dream I remember as a young man, he said,\nBubba, we're going to move the Gainesville, Georgia,\nLake Lanier. And I'm going to catch the Lake record large\nmouth bass. Now, he predicted that. Not only did he predict\nthat, he did that. 55 years now, Lake Lanier's record, he\nhas held at 17 pounds and 9 ounces. And I'll never forget\nthat because the love that I have for my Father will continue. But I want to say a quick\nprayer and thank you everyone for reaching out.\nHeavenly Father, we lift you up and we praise your name. We thank you for each person\nhere. We pray that you be with each family that you put your arms around him. You know\nthe needs and the hurts, but Lord do we know you have us all in your arms. We pray for\nmy mom this morning in my family. As I go to them later, that heavenly Father, we know\nmy Father is with you. We lift up all these people in Jesus' precious name. Amen. Thank\nThank you.\nChair recognizes Representative Buttner for a morning order.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House.\nI too come with a little bit of sad news.\nThe State of Georgia, Taubert County, Georgia, and Junction City in particular, lost the\nlongest serving county commissioner in the state.\nHe passed away January 15th of COVID, and he had served Taubert County as commissioner\nfor 50 years.\nDecember 31st he ended his term after serving 50 years, 35 of the 50 years he was chairman\nof the county commission. I thought it was kind of interesting to learn some things\nabout him as we visited and when he first started in the county commissioner, one of the\nthings he wanted to do was improve the pay and benefits of the county employees. And\nThe other thing he wanted to do was make sure that we had a way for people that were hurt\nor injured to get to a hospital rather than calling the funeral home and writing in\nthe Hearst.\nHe wanted an ambulance.\nSo he set up our ambulance system.\nHe set up seven, he and the rest of the county commission and a lot of grant need help\nalong the way.\nWe now have seven volunteer fire departments, an EMT system and we also were the first\nof many counties to look at how we could coordinate services and we are the first region to have\neight counties come together for a 911 call center. But when you talk to him the thing he was most\nproud of is that his boys went to 4-H camp and they came home and they said daddy,\nTabet County's got a horrible reputation.\nWe are the county with the most non-flushable toilets\nin the state.\nAnd so Freeman Montgomery went and did some research,\nand he got a ticket in Blue to Washington,\nand he came home with a block grant in the 1970s,\nof $900,000.\nAnd they went and they put in running hot water heaters, sinks,\nbathtubs, toilets, and septic tanks to over 100 homes.\nAnd Freeman would tell this story off of them.\nHe would say that a man in his 90s came up to him\nin a public meeting one day and he said,\nyou know, Mr. Montgomery, I gotta thank you.\nYou got me out of the bushes.\nHe said that was his most proud moment, and he would tell anybody that ran for office\nhe said, if any of us run for elected office and we serve for just a day, there are going\nto be those who love us and those who hate us.\nBut he said always remember to make yourself available.\nTo vote time to the job, be honest whether they like it or not, be dependable and be\naccessible and if all of that doesn't work when people call you call them back.\nSo if you would remember his family, his grandchildren and his wife and it is a sad time\nshe has COVID now and they are quite fearful for her as well and Talbot County lost someone\nwho has served them well.\nThank you.\nChair recognizes the Governor's floor leader, Representative Burt Reeves.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nGood morning, colleagues.\nToday I rise to provide some context and some clarity and some talking points about the\nnews stories that are being passed around amongst some of our colleagues and our friends\nout in the hallway.\nThe top story in today's Atlanta Journal Constitution reads, quote, no boost in budget\nfor pandemic.\" It makes it sound as if Georgia has ignored the pandemic. In fact, you have\nto read all the way to the 11th paragraph on page 8A before the story notes that more\nthan $1 billion has been spent by the state government alone in Georgia to respond to\nthe pandemic. And that is more than four times of our annual public health spending.\nIt does not take Georgia Tech calculus to add that up, members.\nHow can that be?\nHow can it say that there's been no boost in the budget when we have quadrupled spending?\nAs recently as last week, Governor Kimp and a press conference said very clearly that\nwe will use every resource.\nOur time, our people and our funding in our response efforts last week when members\nof this General Assembly asked our respected public health leader, Dr. Tumi, why she didn't\nrequest more state funding. She clearly answered that our federal partners have continued\nto provide the assistance that we need, and there's likely to be even more provided under\nthe new administration. In fact, the new administration has already proposed it. They've proposed\n$1.9 trillion. So I urge my colleagues and my friends in the room today, as we work together\nto pass budgets that address the priorities that we all have for our state.\nLet's get past the sensational headlines that very well may sell papers,\nbut do not help Georgians understand the full extent that we have gone through\nto protect both lives and livelihoods in this state. Thank you, Ms. Speaker.\nChair recognizes Representative Wolenski for a morning order.\nThank you, Speaker.\nAs our new U.S. Senators are sworn in, they carried history with them, a history not known\nto many.\nFor me, seeing a Jewish man and a black man in Georgia running side-by-side, running\ntogether for unity and health, jobs, just as for the people who made me extremely hopeful.\nWhile many have learned of the historic significance of the election of the first Jewish and first\nBlack Senators from Georgia, many didn't know the deep history of the Jewish community\nand Black community working together in Georgia throughout the civil rights movement.\nThere is a deep history of the Jewish community and Black community helping each other fight\nfor true justice, because we all know that in justice anywhere, hatred anywhere is injustice\nto everyone.\nTo me, the vision of Senator Assof and Senator Warnoff working together was a 21st century\nversion of Martin Luther King Jr. and Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, a Rep. U.G. from\nHitler's Europe. Dr. King and Rabbi Helstrom can be seen in photos crossing the Edmund\nPettis Bridge, Armin, Armin, Armin, March 1965, and standing together outside Arlington\nCemetery in Silent Protests in 1968. I hope this vision of a Jewish man and a black man\nstanding up together in the fight for equal justice for all inspires us all to come together\nand show the people of Georgia that progress is possible. Their victories prove that the\nhistoric bond between Georgia's Jewish and black communities is alive and well is re-invigorated\nby this historic moment.\nAnother link to Georgia history at Lana History is that Senator Assof was sworn in holding\nHebrew scripture that belonged to Rabbi Jacob Rothschild, past Rabbi of the Temple, a civil\narts activist, and a close ally in front of Dr. King.\nAlso with Senator Assof, in his pocket were copy of the ship's manifest recorded Ellis\nIsland when his great-grandfather arrived in 1911 and his great-grandmother arrived in\n1913.\nA century later, their great grandson was elected to the US Senate, a true American Dream\nstory.\nToday I stand to honor the first U.S. Senator in Georgia,\nJohn Assoff.\nLet's give a round of applause, I hope,\nfor this historic moment at the very least for me\nand all the Jewish people in Georgia.\nThank you.\nI yield the well.\nWe are way out of time on morning orders.\nThose that didn't get reached today will be put\non tomorrow's.\nClark will read the caption to a group\nof privilege resolution.\nHonoring the Life and Memory of Henry Lewis, Hank Aaron, recognizing commending Mayor\nJimmy Guthrie on his outstanding public service, recognizing commending Robert Bobby Howard\non his outstanding services, civil rights advocate, and advocate, and activist, honoring\na life and memory of Jeffrey L. Ellis, recognizing commending and Cagans, honoring a life and memory\nof Alvin Marion Rhodes IV, honoring a life of Mr. Cecil Matthews, and dedicating.\nEcho please the reading of the Privilege Resolutions.\nIs there any objection to adopting the Privilege Resolutions?\nThe chair here is none and the resolutions are adopted.\nChair recognizes the majority leader for a motion.\nspeaker I would move speak to a resolution speak to a resolution yes or\nthat's better but if you insist that I was going to speak to the motion as\nwell I just wanted to get it done let's speak I would ask the clerk if we\nhad read the caption a resolution relative to meetings and adjournments of the\ngeneral assembly chair recognizes the majority leader to explain the\nresolution. Mr. Clerk, if you will put a schedule up, our proposed schedule. I\nthink my colleagues, all of you know that under this speaker's leadership, his\nnumber one priority is the safety. Number one priority is the safety of the\nmembers of this body. But very closely behind that priority is tending to the\npeople's work of this state and make sure we're here. We're doing our work and\nwe're doing it safely and doing it efficiently. With that in mind, there's been\nbeen very close work. There's been schedules been working out with the Senate\nand Leader Dugan and all the leadership on the other side of the hall. They've\nbeen very welcoming and have the same priorities that we do to make sure this\nentire General Assembly operates efficiently, effectively, but with those\npriorities. So with that, all of you see that we will be in tomorrow, Thursday, and Friday of\nthis week. Then we will be out, of course, on the weekend, back in on Monday Tuesday, Wednesday,\nand Thursday of the following week. And then back on Monday, February the 8th, for day,\nliterally day 13. And certainly all of this schedule is opinion on the continued safety of the\nmembers of this body as we work to make sure we complete the people's work here in the house.\nThere are any questions, Mr. Speaker. I will answer those. We have some very important work that\nwe'll be attending to this week. It will come before us, and certainly the Senate will be close\nbehind us as they work on what we send over to them, but we appreciate them working with us\nas we put this schedule together that moves us on down the road towards completing our work here\nin completing our 40 days.\nWith that, Ms. Speaker, if there's any questions,\nI'll answer them, if not, I'll yield the well.\nYou did not have any questions.\nThank you, Ms. Speaker.\nI ask all those in favor of the adoption\nof the resolution will vote aye.\nThose opposed will vote no\nwhen the clerk will unlock the machines.\nHere we go.\nHave all members voted?\nall members now voted. If you\nhaven't voted, we're going to close\nit down here in a minute. You can\ncome down here and check in with\nthe clerk's office. Final call\nhave all members voted.
