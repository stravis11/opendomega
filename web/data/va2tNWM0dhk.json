I am aware that you have a full day of work\nand I have a senior pastor who is a commitment to a strong sense of timeliness. So I know I have\nfive minutes. It is true I grew up in Evans, Georgia and have covered most of the state from\nyoung Harris to Valdosta to here in the city of Atlanta. I've lived in Cobb to Cabb and Fulton\nin County and now live in the 48th district.\nI will keep my remarks brief.\nI'm gonna share a few lessons I learned with a group\nof high school students as we were stranded in Colorado\nfor two additional days last week.\nWe got snowed in.\nAnd I must admit, I am not one who does well with snow.\nI'm a Georgia peach.\nI'm made for hot Atlanta.\nI thrive with hot cocoa and warm blankets.\nI need ear warmers and I don't know how those\nwere unhoused do well.\nI want it warm and not cold.\nAnd if it was up to me, when it's under 40, we'd go home.\nWe'd shut down from OSA January and February,\nbut that is not my decision.\nSo last Monday, as we went to leave from the YMCA camp\nwith 21 high schoolers, we thought it would take\nabout two hours to get to Interstate 70.\nUnfortunately, it took seven hours.\nWe had whiteouts, we saw spinning out cars.\nI made prayers to the Lord God Almighty\nthat I may never be able to cash in on.\nI ask God to keep these sweet precious children alive.\nI worried about our safety.\nI worried if we would be sleeping in the cold.\nI thought I might be sharing a van\nwith some very smelly teenage boys.\nAnd yet, seven hours later,\nwe made it to the inner state.\nOnly to find out it was closed.\nAnd we would not be making it to Denver.\nAnd we would not be joining our flight that was leaving.\nAnd as a result, we started calling travel agents\nand parents.\nI started working with teenagers who were crying\nbecause they would not be missing school.\nAnd no, that is not why they were crying.\nThey were upset because they would be missing tryouts\nand friends and boyfriends and girlfriends\nand they were stuck with some people they really liked\nand some they were trying to learn to like.\nAnd so two more days in these snowy mountains\nwe would stay.\nAnd slowly we found a new hotel to stay in\nand we were able to order cheap pizza\nand they learned that there was a hot tub\nAnd maybe all would be okay.\nAnd as we got to the evening,\nI was able to ask our kids,\nwhat were the highs and what were the lows?\nAnd where did they see God in the midst of a day\nthat had gone very, very wrong?\nAnd I, the pastor, stopped and listened and got wisdom\nfrom a bunch of high schoolers.\nAnd they shared with me where they saw God\nin the midst of the day.\nMaybe you too will have days\nthat will go very, very wrong.\nIt is my prayer that this session will be easy and breezy.\nIt is my prayer that you will do good, hard work,\nthat you will make a difference on behalf\nof your constituents.\nBut maybe sometimes things won't go as you planned either.\nSo let me share with you the wisdom they shared with me.\nWhat makes hard days better days?\nA good night's sleep.\nSnacks.\nBring snacks with you.\nFriends who can make you laugh, knowing that they're adults who are working on your behalf.\nFaith in a creator who is at work in the world at all times, and who never leaves you,\nnor forsakes you.\nKnowing that you can pray at all times and that there are others who are praying for\nyou, that you can turn your eyes to the heavens, just like the psalmist says, and that it is\nokay to turn off your phones and go and play.\nfriends, you may need that same very advice this session. Maybe you will need a\nlittle rest when the session gets long. Maybe you'll just need a head to bed.\nMaybe you'll need snacks. Maybe you'll need a lean into your friends. Maybe you'll\nneed to ask and seek wise counsel. Maybe you'll need to know that there are other\nadults who care for you. Maybe you'll need to trust in God when you don't know\nhow God is working in the world.\nMaybe you need to know that there are church members,\nconstituents and even strangers who are praying for you.\nMaybe you need to stop and turn off your phone\nand go outside and get in nature.\nHow will you know that you are okay\nin the midst of all that is going on around you?\nSometimes things go wrong friends.\nSometimes you will do everything right,\njust like we thought we had, and it still doesn't go as planned.\nI want you to know that even when you do everything you're supposed to do, that God is still\nfor you, that God is not against you, that you are loved and that there are people praying\nfor you, and that sometimes there is wisdom in the words of high schoolers, rest, eat\nyour snacks, turn off your phones, and go and pray.\nAnd if you give it just enough time,\neither the session will end or God will show up\nin unexpected ways.\nLet us pray.\nGracious and loving God,\nwe give you things that you show up\nwhen we don't expect it.\nSometimes life is a storm and sometimes life is easy.\nO God, we ask that you would give us eyes to see\nand ears to hear and a heart to receive.\nAnd when we forget,\nsurround us with high schoolers or wiser adults\nto have eyes to look to you,\nhelp us to trust, to believe and to know\nthat we are loved and we are never alone.\nAnd the name of the one who made the mountains in the snow\nand the name of the one who made this very capital,\nwe give you thanks.\nAmen.\nThank you.\nYou\nYou\nYou\nYou\nYou\nYou\nYou\nYou\nIf I could have everyone's attention real quick, as we do, we're going to have everyone's\nattention.\nreal quick as we do every day we always like to recognize our physicians that\ncome down here and and give their time to us here at the Capitol and we have\nvery special guests today and I would like to call on the senator from the\n42nd to introduce our special. Thank you mr. President colleagues it's my\ndistinct honor to welcome to the chamber this morning as our doctor of the day\nDr. Short. He is a in family practice with Piedmont Urgent Care. He is a\nproud graduate of LSU Medical School and he completed his residency at the\nUniversity of Florida. He resides in the City of Baruchaven. Please join me in\nwelcoming and thanking Dr. Short for being with us today.\nGood morning. I really enjoy coming here and serving you guys because I know how\nhard you work and I know what you do and all I ask is that you in your\nlegislative effort that you keep health care in mind and in particular urgent\ncare. I've been in Urgent Care for a long long time and you want to appreciate\nhow important Urgent Care is and just think of what COVID would have been\nlight without urgent care centers. I'm sure many of you have been to an urgent\ncare and hopefully you've recovered well. But again, I really want to say thank\nyou for what you do. It does not go unnoticed. Thank you again.\nYou\nYou\nWe have some special guests here today and light the secretary to read the caption, please.\nSenate Resolution 441 by Senators Kennedy of the 18th and others, a resolution recognizing\nand commending Marcus Woods and for other purposes.\nWhereas during his distinguished career, Marcus Woods has consistently demonstrated exceptional\nskill, leadership and commitment to it in his role as a football referee, where he has\nlong represented the state of Georgia, and whereas he discovered his love for officiating\nfootball in 2007, and whereas his collegiate officiating career has led him to work during\nsignificant games such as the ACC Championship, Fiesta Bowl, Peach Bowl, and the 2022 Army\nNavy game. And whereas he has further refereed, the College Football Playoff Bowl games and\nwill serve as the main referee for the 2024 College Football National Championship.\nAnd whereas it is abundantly fitting and proper that the outstanding accomplishments of the\nremarkable and distinguished Georgian be appropriately recognized. Now, therefore be it resolved by\nthe Senate that the members of this body recognize and commend Marcus Woods for his many years of\nefficient, effective, and exemplary service as a football referee, as well as extend best wishes\nfor his continued success.

So,\ny'all please come and have fun with us and appreciate you, Ms. President, I yield the well.\nDoes any other senator wish to rise on a point of personal privilege?\nfrom the 43rd.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nGood morning, colleagues.\nToday is Healthy Mother's Healthy Babies,\nMaternal Awareness Day at the Georgia State Capitol,\nbut they will be celebrating at the Presbyterian Church.\nIt is also a doula day at the Capitol, room 125,\nwhere you can meet a doula and learn more\nabout their scope of practice.\nIt is imperative that we, as a state of Georgia,\nnot only address Medicaid expansion,\nbut address maternal mortality in this assembly\nin this chamber. Why? Because Georgia has the second highest rate of maternal mortality\nof 48.4 percent per one, I'm sorry, 48.4 per 100,000 Georgians. The maternal mortality\nrate report shows that this is the highest concern and it is an adequate follow-up of cardiovascular\nsymptoms and pregnant women and particularly in black women. Failure to recognize and treat\nhypertension or hemorrhages soon enough has been an issue. Researchers have reported\nthat in more than one-third of cases they were unsure of where maternal or paternal care\nbegan for mothers and confirmed that some who died received more prenatal care, no prenatal\ncare at all. I'm sorry. Black mothers in Georgia are more likely to die from\npregnancy as they are in the as they are in the rest of the United States and\nespecially in states with rural areas. Again, let's support change in the\nmaternal mortality rate here in Georgia, expand Medicaid, and meet a doula\ntoday in room 125. Thank you, Mr. President, I y'all the well.\nDoes any of the senator wish to rise on a point of personal privilege?\nYou have before you a consent calendar of privilege resolutions, does any senator wish to remove\nresolution on the consent calendar?\nIs there objection to the adoption of the resolution on the consent calendar?\nChair, here's none.\nThe resolution of the consent calendar is adopted.\nOh, are there any motions that were drawn and commit?\nYou\nWe just had some special guests come into the chambers today and Senator from the 30\nsecond wanted to recognize them and I wanted us to recognize them as well.\nWe have the council general from the country of Japan, a great friend and of ours here\nnot only in the country but this state and we are happy to have the council general here\ntoday, and I recognize the senator from the 30-second to introduce our special guest.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nToday, if you haven't noticed, is Japan Day at the Capitol, so there are vendors outside\ninside, and then we are very happy to have the Council General from Japan, Mio Maeda,\nhis wife with us today and along with Senator from what district, District 40, we're\nco-chairs, Senate co-chairs of the Japan caucus, and former representative Tom Taylor also\nrepresents the Japanese group.\nAnd I probably don't have to tell you all this, but Japan's had a great big impact on\nGeorgia's economy. We have 885 companies that have offices in Georgia with a complete economic\nbenefit of around 9.75 billion. And I've had an opportunity to visit Japan, but if you haven't,\nyou can get a really good feel for the culture by going to Japan Fest, which is held at the\nGuneck County, Guest, South Arena, and this year, I believe it's September 14th and 15th.\nSo with that, we did do a resolution that I will present to the Council General, and\nI'd love for you all to welcome him to the Chamber to give a few remarks.\nThank you.\nThank you very much.\nWell, what to be honest, I didn't expect that I have to make a speech.\nI didn't prepare anything, but anyway.\nThank you so much, and I also thank you all of you\nfor your continued support to the Japanese companies\nand Japanese people here.\nAnd I do, well, as I mentioned, as you mentioned,\nthis is a 50th anniversary of the establishment\nof our office.\nAnd we are looking forward to, we are\nWe are determined to continue our effort to enhance and expand the relations between Japan\nand Georgia, the state of Georgia, and we are looking forward to continue support from\nall of you.\nThank you very much.\nYou\nYou\nYes.\nThank you, Mr. President, I move that the Senate stand adjourned until Wednesday 10 a.m.\nJanuary 24th.\nThe majority leader has moved, six Terry, read the announcements.\nThe Rules Committee will meet immediately upon adjournment today in room 450.\nThe Children and Families Committee will meet at 1.15 p.m. in 307 of the CLOB today.\nThe Education and Youth Committee will be at 2.30 p.m. in 450 today.\nThe Regulated Industries and Utilities Committee will meet at 4 o'clock p.m. in 450.\nAnd the Ethics Committee will meet at 5 o'clock p.m. in 307 of the COLOB today.\nThat completes your order, Mr. President.\nThe majority leader has moved that the Senate stand adjourned until tomorrow, 10 a.m.,\nJanuary 24th.\nAll those in favor of the motion will just seek to file by saying aye.\nAll those opposed, no.\nWow, not a one of y'all said I.\nWe're adjourned, guys have it.\n",
