Our chaplain today is brought to us and will be introduced by the lady from the 135th House District, Beth Camp, chair-related camp. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It's an honor to be here today to introduce Billy Smith. Billy Smith is a humble individual. He is the pastor of Christchapel Church in Zebulin, Georgia, which now has seven campuses. He is married to the lovely Tina, and they have four beautiful children, and their second to the youngest is here today, Max, and he's a guest here with his dad, and we're thankful for his presence here. In a world where a lot of people don't listen, I'm going to give Billy Smith a lot of credit. He listens to everyone. He is so kind and compassionate, and it's an honor to introduce him today. So, Pastor Billy Smith. Thank you, sir. Good morning. Thank you. It's an honor to be here once again to share some scripture and some thoughts for our morning devotion. Thank you, Representative Camp, and Mr. Speaker Burns. Thanks for the opportunity. In the English language, words change over time. It's something that meant something 25 years ago may mean something completely different now. And I'm learning that there's a generation behind me that uses words in a way that I completely don't understand. Maybe you have kids or grandkids, and they're saying stuff, and you're like, I don't know what you're talking about. But years ago, somebody would have called you a goat, or an old goat. That would not have been something that was very flattering. But the word has changed. You know, goat now is the greatest of all time, and for somebody that call you a goat is actually a wonderful thing. You know, so some of you guys, I'll give you a tip, go home and tell your old lady, hey, you're the goat, and see how that goes today. But explain to her, it means she's the greatest of all time, right? There's a controversy and conversations about goats and all kinds of different categories. If you're talking about basketball, then the current generation may say it's LeBron James or Steph Curry or a boo over here. If you're from my generation and watch basketball in the 80s and 90s, and then we would say it was definitely Michael Jordan is the goat. And if you're older than me, you watch Wilk Chamberlain. Maybe you're saying, no, young man, you don't know Wilk was the man. And soccer football around the world is what they call it. Maybe it's messy or Ronaldo. And in the business world, maybe people are considering the goats, people like Bill Gates or Warren Buffett. Jesus had some interesting things to say about people who wanted to be great. First of all, he didn't say it was wrong to want to be great. But he said there is some contingencies connected to greatness that your culture and your world are not going to teach you. And I want to read you a passage from Mark, chapter 10, verse 43. Jesus was speaking to his followers and he said, not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to be great among you must become a servant, must serve others. For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve others and to give his life as a ransom for many. It seems to me that Jesus is saying in the kingdom world, greatness is not determined by your status, but it's determined by your service, by what we give people. I would treat others. And Jesus didn't only teach this kind of servitude, but he lived it out often. It didn't take but a brief moment in the Gospels to see that Jesus was always looking for opportunities to help and serve other people. James and John got into a heated argument at the last supper. Maybe you're familiar with this. They wanted to know, could I sit on the left and he sit on the right when you take over Jesus? They thought he was going to have a earthly kingdom. That was not what he was here for. He was here for a bigger purpose to take care of our sin that humanity had created. I am so grateful for that today. But James and John were saying, hey, when you take over, we're the goat. Don't forget us. We're the elite. We want you to remember us. And Jesus, it's not in commentary, so I don't want you to think I'm mad in the scripture, but I can almost imagine his frustration after modeling servitude for so long. And here they are having the last supper. And James and John are fighting a Hoover who's the greatest. I think maybe Jesus probably shook his head and when these boys are never going to get it, they're just not going to figure it out. Jesus looked out there and what he saw when he looked at his followers at that supper was he saw proud hearts and dirty feet. There have been times in my life I didn't serve others because of my own pride and my arrogance, my self-importance. And Jesus is teaching us today that when we do it under the least of these, we do it under him. Jesus got up on that day when he saw dirty feet and he did what the other ones weren't willing to do. Everybody saw that their feet were dirty. It was custom in that culture that somebody would be positioned at the door to wash the feet of the disciples or whoever was entering the home. They had been traveling to make sure that their feet were clean and they were prepared and ready for the meal. And that detail had been overlooked. And Jesus saw that along with the other disciples but only one person stood up in that room and said, I will serve you today. Jesus got up from the meal. This is John, Chapter 13. Took off his outer clothing, wrapped the towel around his waist. After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash the feet of the disciples, drying them with a towel that he had wrapped around him. What an amazing example. That the King of Glory, the God of the Universe, was looking for opportunities to serve others. I want to say this, you know, from just a citizen of the state of Georgia, I appreciate you guys serving our state. I think we got the best state in the United States. I believe that. And I think it's because of the people in this room. But I want to ask you, as I ask myself today, are we serving others the way that Jesus expects? A couple weeks ago, I watched a friend of mine take two days off from work to help another mutual friend who had recently gone through the tragedy of divorce. He took two days off of his job to help him move the contents of his home. I'm going to tell you something. You got to love somebody to help him move, kind of get an amen this morning, right? I don't know what had junk out there, but he served him. I watched a guy who lives in North Georgia who actually has a business in North Georgia in Canton, but he lives in Zabielin. He heard of the need of some middle school boys in our school who were missing some fathers. And they were making some bad decisions. And I watched a guy who's very busy and very successful. So you know what? I'll take two afternoons a month and come home early. I want to serve these boys. They have a future and we don't want to see it ruined. I recently have stood in front of my congregation and at other campuses that we have and asked people who attended the main service, the prime time service to say, hey, I want you to serve other people and go to a different service time. Of course we have people who are coming and they don't have seats and my family of five can't sit together. There's an expectation for us to prefer the other. And I watch people change their whole Sunday morning routine so they can serve other people and make sure that when they got the God's house they had a seat. I can do better in this regard. I think I could become a better server. I could look for needs. We have a staying at Christchoppe, find the need and meet it, find a hurt and heal it. I want to ask God to give us years to hear and I ask to see all the people around us that are hurting. Thank you for your time today. Would you stand and allow me to pray and after that we'll stay standing for the pledge. We'll go across this room or some really incredible leaders. People who have worked hard to find their place to help lead this wonderful state. I pray that today is a day that they make progress. I pray that this state becomes better than it's ever been. I believe in Georgia. I believe in the people in this room. And I pray that you honor them and bless their homes, their families, their businesses, their places where they worship. Would you bless them today? I pray those things in the wonderful name of Christ. Amen. Let's do the pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, to the Republic, to which it stands. We nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Thank you. You can be seated. Thank you, sir. Thank you, brother Billy. Thank you for that message. We thank you for your ministry. We thank you for your ministry at Christchoppe. We're going to take a photo.

The book was written by my grandmother, Varianne, Doater of Georgia. During her time on this, she was an educator entrepreneur and worked in civil rights, particularly around teachers rights and the desecration of Brady Housepeel. But particularly this book, especially to me, because as we sit here, my grandmother is a Reverend, but I'm not. So I'm not going to quote scripture, but somewhere in the book, I mean, the great book, the Bible says, before there was all of this stuff, there was the Word. So remember, when we're writing bills, we're passing legislation, make sure we put in the Word first. And throughout, you can look on the table of context, and there's different things, regardless if it's here or in your life that you can go through. And particularly, I'd like to speak about warfare, because not only are we at spiritual warfare, we are economic warfare. We're at war against drugs, war against poverty, and even if they're at look across this world, we can see war across this earth. So before I go, I just want to leave you with a scripture. Romans, where is it? Sorry, speaker. Romans 10, 17. So then come, then faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God. Thank you. I you're the will. Thank you, Representative.

We will begin my afternoon orders with my recognizing representative Silcox but first I'm going to ask the clerk if you'll read the caption to the resolution and then you're recognized representative. House resolution 50. The members will stand please. Yes. By representative Silcox the 53rd resolution recognizing January 27, 2025 as international Holocaust Remembrance Day and for other purposes. Representative Silcox is recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I rise today in recognition of international Holocaust Remembrance Day. We are honored today to have some important guests with us. Council General Anat Sultan Dodan as well as the executive director of the Georgia Commission on the Holocaust Sally Levine as well as commission members Robert Weinstein, Manipiaco and David Burmberry. As a member of the Georgia Holocaust Commission on the Holocaust, I want to thank Speaker Burns and for all of the spotty for the passage of HB 30 a little over a year ago today. This bill defined anti-Semitism in Georgia so it can be prosecuted as part of a hate crime. I also thank God for the release of some of the hostages in Israel and I pray for the release of all the hostages. It is important today to remember the Holocaust. The world stood silently in the 1930s and 40s as millions of Jews were murdered. This should never ever happen again. The anti-Semitism that led to the Holocaust then is unfortunately alive and well today, especially given the attack on October 7, 2023 and acts against the Jewish people since then worldwide. Today is also remarkable because it is the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the constant-cretation camp Auschwitz-Burkenau. Please allow me to read the resolution that details this event. Whereas the Holocaust was a state-sponsored systematic persecution and annihilation of European Jews by Nazi Germany and its collaborators between 1933 and 1945, resulting in the murder of over 6 million Jews as well as the oppression and deaths of many others, including Roma, people with disabilities and Polish people. Whereas in 1998 HB 1664 was passed by the Georgia legislature establishing the Georgia Commission on the Holocaust as a permanent state agency charging it with creating educational programs for citizens and operating as a secular non-provisant partisan entity. Whereas the Georgia Commission on the Holocaust is tasked with preserving the memory of the Holocaust, promoting public understanding of its history and reminding citizens to remain vigilant against hatred, anti-Semitism, persecution, and genocide. Whereas January 27, the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Burkenau is observed as international Holocaust remembered day to memorialize these 6 million victims of the Holocaust and the others who were persecuted by the Nazis. Whereas January 27 marks the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, a critical time to honor the victims, survivors, and liberators while recognizing the lessons of Holocaust history missed an alarming global rise in anti-Semitism. Whereas located in German occupied Oppolun, Auschwitz consisted of three camps, including Burkenau, a killing center where over a million victims were systematically murdered by individuals and professionals involved in its operations. Whereas trains carrying Jews from Nazi occupied land and allied Europe regularly arrived at Auschwitz where its leadership and workers conduct in these systematic killings over nearly five years. Whereas in mid-45, Soviet forces approached Auschwitz, SS units forcefully evacuated nearly 60,000 prisoners on death marches under brutal winter conditions, resulting in thousands of deaths from starvation, exposure, and violence. Whereas the Soviet army liberated Auschwitz, freeing the remaining 7,000 prisoners, many of whom were sick and dying, ending the camp's operation. Whereas we, the people of Georgia, joined communities throughout the world today in commemorating this very special International Holocaust Remembrance Day and honoring the victims, survivors, and liberators of the Holocaust. I thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the House for your attention. I yield well. Ladies, you will. Thank you members. Thank you members for this House for standing strong in support of our friends. Stories still to me told us soon forgotten, we must always tell the story of the Holocaust and how our greatest generation came together to stop out that evil, the midst of our world. And our thoughts and prayers still go out those survivors and their families. Thank you, Representative. We have another couple of remembrances of some lives that folks have gone on to be in a better place. So with that, I'm going to recognize Chairman Dickie. I'm going to ask the membership if you will stand again, please, for these next couple of. I like to ask you a Monroe County delegation. I don't see a Monroe County. We're here. Monroe County lost a longtime citizen last week and I just wanted to recognize the life of Benson Ham, a former legislator in this body for 10 years. But he grew up in a little small unincorporated place called Smarr in Monroe County and got his legal degree and grew up there and practiced all their entire life. But anything that went on in Monroe County for many years went through Benson Ham and he was a great friend to that community. He loved it. He loved agriculture. He served here as I said for 10 years, followed by son and law, I believe, Curtis Jenkins. But he's on the state board of elections for many years. Chairman of the Monroe County Board of Education for 13 years, guided it through desegregation and funding for New High School. And also so active in economic development during his term, Plant Chair, located there as well as Georgia Public Safety Training Center. That's the kind of man, Benson Ham was. He went on to serve later in electric rule electrification, chairman of Central Georgia Electric Membership, Corporative and President of the National Rule Utilities Finance Corporation. So Benson Ham as well as a director for Farm Bureau, his resume is a bit where he just went on and on and on and just wanted to say thank you, Benson, for all he worked, he did for Monroe County for 93 years and his entire family. He was a real star work of that community. So let's have a moment of silence if you would. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chairman Dick, if you're remaining in the well, I think you have a no-the-after-in-order. I think we could I do that another day. Another day, okay. Absolutely. If you're remaining standing, I'm going to recognize Representative Kelly for your remembrance. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the House. Friday, just today, after his 90th birthday, the Polk County Community lost one of our most treasurer's citizens in the Pascale of Guy, Rutland. Mr. Rutland was married to his wife, Linda, for over 44 years, two children together, Ashley and Judd. Mr. Rutland was a remarkable individual. He was a teacher and coach for over 33 years. He graduated from Cedar Town High School, Jacksonville State University. He was really proud of his gamecots and got his master's from middle Tennessee State University. He was also a farmer and entrepreneur. He started Christmas Tree City, where he sold Christmas trees for over 47 years. After his career in teaching and coaching, he remained active in our community as a member of the Retired Teachers Association, our Catalyst Association, and was just beloved by all who knew him. I was honored to call him a friend and while our work today will keep me from attending his funeral, at the day I want his family to know that they're our thoughts and our prayers. If you'll please join me in a moment of silence from Mr. Guy Rutland. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the web. Thank you, Representative. And our thoughts and prayers do go out those, but also thank you all for recognizing these folks. Members, you can be seated for our lives well-lived. Thank you for your respect, members, as the members that came to the well-directed out of these families. Okay, we have another great honor. Chairman Martin comes coming down with some friends from the University of Georgia, UGA. Chairman Martin, so if you're a friend of University of Georgia, it'll be a good time for you to show up here. Representative Evans, I know you are as well. You're a double dog, aren't you? Yeah. Todd Jones is coming up. Come on down, brother. Oh, he's at least standing. You're about to get the full crowd down here, Chairman Martin. I thank you. It comes with Majority Leader. We need you down here, Majority Leader. I thank you for a dog fan as well. You've given the gentleman in the well, your attention. I think I have to announce that. Report of the announcement. Chairman Martin. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members. After those solemn remembrances, I bring something that we can celebrate and something that I hope was a part of those folks' lives. Today, January 27th, 2025, is the 240th anniversary of the University of Georgia founded in 1785. The University of Georgia is chartered in 1785 as the birthplace of higher education in America, launching our nation's tradition of world-class education. The charter was established by the University of Georgia as the nation's first state or nation's first state university. Today, public education creates tens of millions of informed citizens. UGA is the number 16 public university in the country. It has over 50 Marshall and Rhodes Scholars and other prestigious postgraduate scholarship. It's the top five, in the top five universities for getting products to market. More than these things and more than a land and a building, UGA is tradition and it grows stronger every year with every student and every class asks you to give the University of Georgia on its 240th birthday a round of applause and our thanks for leading our state. Thank you, New York University. Go Dogg go dogg! Congratulations, Ca360. Fabulous land grant university. Thank you for that. Representative Chairman Martin. Representative Reese. Representative Teddy Reese. Members, if you'll give the gentleman about to be in the well, your attention. So, it's me and just for a second, sir, let me. Another important announcement. Representative Reese. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you so much for this opportunity to stay here today. Today, we recognize this weekend the celebration of a founding of a very important organization, especially for the growth and development of African American children. And that is Jack and Jill of America. Jack and Jill was founded in 1938 and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with initially 10 chapters. We now have 271 chapters across the United States of America representing 50,000 kids here in the United States. Last year, we were represented by an amazing president who served as from Columbus, Georgia. And this year, we are honored to be under the leadership of President Garline McGee, Winninton, right here from Atlanta, Georgia. So, Mr. Speaker, it is true. Some of the best leadership comes right here from the peace state. Thank you so much for your opportunity. Thank you so much for your opportunity. No doubt about that. We can all agree on that.
