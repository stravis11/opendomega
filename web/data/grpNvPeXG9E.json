  "transcript": "Hey, great. The gift to be where we just actually delight us in guys for stating it's here today and that you will be done with is in Jesus name we pray. Anyway, senator summer's if you would like to go ahead trade with your testimony. Thank you, chamber dix, Chairman Dixon. I would like to start by telling you thank you all for taking your time to come into a hearing on a nice hot August in the middle of reconstruction in the capital and I'd like to thank the members of the audience for coming. I mean you know this is how we get things done we talk about it we work it out we tweak it we try to come up with the best way you know for what we're trying to lay out so thank you all for taking your time to come up I know some of us like Senator Sam's over here has a long distance drive and some of you have a long distance drive living close by just with traffic but thank you anyway for being here. Let's start by talking a little bit about Senate Bill 88 you know when we presented Senate Bill 88 a year ago Senate Bill 88 needed tweaking and need some work and this committee and its wisdom saw it need to be tabled and worked on and I greatly appreciate that and so we have the new version of Senate Bill 88 we have tried to make sure that we are 100% focused on our goal and our goal this goal was simple before I get into deep this goal is very simple all we're simply saying on Senate Bill 88 is if you're going to talk gender to a child under 16 years old you need to notify the parent or the guardian and let them understand what the curriculum is about and we're asking the fact that anyone in local parentess and everyone understands that local parentess means what you're in charge of a child whoever's in charge of a child school church 4-H it doesn't matter whoever's in charge of the child that time did not discuss gender with that child it is not your job to discuss gender with a child that is the parent or the guardian's position to do that or a professional and I want to make something else really clear if anyone is in local parentess feels that this child is in danger for any reason whatsoever they couldn't go home and talk to mom and dad or a guardian or whatever then that person in charge of that child can refer that child to the proper authorities counselors etc etc and they can talk to that child and find out what the issues are and work to help that child out that's what that's what's built about simply now as you all know there's been emails going around and Texas going around and whatever that this is the don't say gay bill you know I would like to tell you nothing could be further from the truth nothing could be further from the truth absolutely has nothing to do with your gender or your sexual persuasion in this bill zero absolutely now I know people will argue that fact but they'll you cannot find it in this bill it has anything to do with that so here's the deal I don't want anyone talking to my grandchild about his gender and trying to persuade him to change his gender not changes all the above I don't want him telling him to hit I don't want a racist person maybe teaching my child talking to my child and talking about racism and trying to teach him to be a racist person I want that to be left up to the parents or the guardian at least to their 16 years old which is the age of consent in Georgia and that way we'll move forward on these things and we'll stop all the issues it comes up I want to say for the record I have wonderful friends that are have different sexual persuasions and I do wonderful friends we have no issue I have run this by several of them and they like they'd have no issue about what I do what I say what we're doing in this bill here because it is not a don't say gay bill it's not I understand the ones behind me think that and they want to make fun about it but the reality of it is is I don't care if it's their children your children and my children it's not the responsibility of the person in charge to teach these kids what they feel is right when it comes to gender that's the basically the crux of this bill and they have a problem with that if people have a problem with that then they truly have issues because the reality of it is is this a child protection bill this is what this bill is about child protection now I can go into a lot of issues about our talking points I can explain the bill but to in lieu of time I'd like to start off by an adieu and I got Tom Rollins over here Thomas Constitution lawyer who helped with the bill he's worked with the bill he understands what we're going on and I miss Kate Hudson I've run this side of here miss Kate has a group that she's formulated and she's been working with us diligently to explain what's going on and all these facilities out there where there would be schools charter schools regular schools like I said four eight church camps all the above and she's going to bring a presentation to us and I start like start with Tom if you don't mind miss chairman let Tom go in his his part of about the constitutionality of it thank you good morning about him well you know is that working actually 12th good how I hope everybody's good this morning I want to say first of all we're working with a version of this bill as chairman said that it's very different than one that's introduced last year that bill itself even after we did the changes last year that before it was tabled has been completely narrowed down it's very narrow and skate and skate let me talk first about what's bill is not about this center of summer said it does not involve sex education or sexual orientation at all rather it specifically addresses discussions of gender identity and the bill itself does not take a stand on whether discussing gender identity is a good thing or a bad thing rather the bill instead addresses two very specific issues at the intersections of schools gender identity the first involves instruction generally on gender identity issues now public and charter schools are going to be required simply to create clear policies involving classroom discussions of instruction on issues of gender identity while private schools the ones who want to participate in GHSA are in the specialty scholarship program need to notify parents of their intent to engage in gender identity instruction for children under 16 and give parents the option to opt out or if parents don't respond they opt out automatically the second issue involves how public schools and charter schools specifically manage specific cases in which children under 16 have concerns regarding their gender identity their desire to transition to a different gender or they express concerns of gender dysphoria we are simply requiring schools here to adopt clear policies on these issues that so that parents can be aware of them if the Decatur City Schools wants to adopt a policy for example in which students will have more privacy when they speak to a teacher or counselor regarding gender identity issues they may be involved with nothing is stopping the school board indicator from doing that but if Decatur County down in Bainbridge if they want to adopt a policy of notifying parents when a child expresses gender incongruence that's up to the good people of Decatur County so why should y'all care about this I think the question is why should the general simply be involved in this first I think in terms of child protection and child emotional well being for a child to feel a disconnect between his or her sex biological sex and gender identity is often emotionally painful although there are plenty of disagreements about the source of this pain everything everyone agrees that gender that children and youth who expendr excuse me who experienced gender dysphoria have much higher rates of suicidal ideation and suicidal attempts children with eating disorders other mental health challenges and autism were also represented at much higher rates among those with gender identity issues so having a gender identity issue could be a signal of a deeper issue parents have a significant interest in knowing if their child struggling with these issues so they can ensure the child is receiving appropriate treatment now you'll notice in the bill however that nothing in the bill prohibits a school from taking steps to protect a child if there are reasonable grounds to believe that telling the parent will harm the child and we can have the schools develop various policies on that issue with the help of the state school board and second although gender identity and sexual orientation are separate issues poor handling of classroom instruction and our school counseling on these issues can result in in conflation of the two and really can call serious damage to the child sense of self studies show and I don't think anybody disagrees with this that many children who struggle with gender identity end up not as transgender but as either lesbian or gay as a writer for the Atlantic magazine recently put it many of the gender identity curricula they're using schools around the country right now can create confusion for the Tom Boy girl or the boy who prefers to play with girls a girl a child who doesn't fit these gender stereotypes maybe led down a path into believing their gender non conformity means they're actually stuck in the wrong body and I've got a great quote from the Atlantic writer here although American society's approach to matters of gender identity is clearly still in flux and reasonable people disagree on how best to engage students on the subject some educators are writing progressive activist views into detail lessons for young children an alternative approach might be to promote inclusion in the broadest plaintiffs possible terms and reassure children there is no wrong way to be you school should therefore take care in teaching such concepts of children and young teens without notice and and making sure that parents are notified are that there are clear policies regarding pro notification of gender curricula finally I would just point out that parents are concerned about this issue a significant majority of Democrats independence and Republicans are very concerned about schools that are teaching on gender issues are counseling children on gender identity issues without informing parents in New Jersey and California right now there is an ongoing legal battles between the state school system and the local school districts about whether or not to inform parents when a child adopts a different gender identity but this bill as I said allows each local school district to adopt its own policies thank you thank you Tom miss chairman I like introduce miss Kate Hudson let her take a few minutes good morning I'm Kate Hudson founder of education veritas Westminster alumni and mother of three boys education veritas was born out of a need and desire for parents to be educated and empowered through truth and concrete information coming out of the private schools we believe children are not tools or weapons to push political agendas Instagram is the platform with where much of our content is put out we have close to 15,000 followers from all over and I have first hand witnessed and continue to see within the vast majority of private schools here in Atlanta especially the elite Christian ones beyond comprehension what what is coming out of them I've lived with this for the past four years with three children 14 to 19 years old my youngest was at Westminster and the other two were at different private schools I had to pull two of the three out and put that put them at one of the last private schools that was not pushing will curriculum this is traumatic for these kids it's not just as simple as just pull them out we are connected to thousands of parents across Georgia that are having to navigate these dark waters of indoctrination and feel zero transparency is taking place parents are faced with deprogram deep programming their kids every day in feeling trapped in a private or public school where the agenda cannot be escaped this is a common tale from parents every day I am stunned by the conversations and battles were being forced to have over parental rights in the acute need for children to be educated in academics and truth I'm not a politician I'm a mom and this hijacking of the educational system public and private is damaging our children I was going to share with you some slides appear I can you all have them in front of you printed but I'll turn this so you can see as well this is a mere no no so we have this is a fraction of the accounts that we have been given from all private schools all divisions from pre-K through twelfth grade this will give you a little bit of insight into what's transpiring within the private schools so and then I will follow up these slides with a summary of what's taking place so here is a slide recording what the love at school in Atlanta feels about the job you're doing and the bills that you're sending down and that they are pushing off you know what you're doing in brainwashing faculty and students as a poor job and these are all in front of you this all started at Westminster where the chaplain was directing five to ten year olds to please stand if they identified as a girl stand if they identified as a boy Westminster six great admissions prompt for their essay was regarding a transgender child and their elementary school experience and the valuable lessons that we can all learn to better support the transgender community this was for 10 to 11 year olds the next slides are from St. Martin's school this is seventh grade handout for the middle school and this handout was shared with all the students and then it was taken up after class to keep out of parent size so these next few slides are the excerpts the four pages from that handout and just a few blips from it it says researches say there's five to seven sexes 1.7 percent have sexual differentiation so in essence aligning conditions that people are born with as being a common sexual differentiation as opposed to just a common you know sexual difference this notion of assigned sex at birth is obviously absurd and children are born a boy or girl but there's a continual hammering of a doctor is looking at a child and determining whether they're a boy or girl this is next slides from the Holiness and Episcopal School their religion class the head the teacher came in and said that we're no longer gonna say hey guys you're all gonna say hey y'all and I want you to practice this right now we're gonna all say it together hey y'all because that's not an inclusive statement and not everyone identifies in that way the next few slides are hold on one second we've got a full room here when anyone is at the podium speaking we're gonna respect them we're not gonna allow any outburst just want to make that very clear thank you please go ahead so the next few slides are from a love it day of silence panel that they had a drag queen who came in and two other members three other members of their alumni they came in and did a presentation for the students there and with these it's just illustrating what they're what they were basically telling the students faculty and any parents that were there love it is denying biological science and truth says medical professionals label a baby when it's born they go into gender gender identity slide a person's internal sense of their gender and then goes through non-binary transgender woman girl man boy gender expression sexual orientation where it reads sexual orientation involves involves through a multi-stage developmental process and may change over time it is on a continuum and not a set of absolute categories they then go into personal pronouns using names and corrective gendering and correctly gendering someone the next slide is from the Westminster schools this is regarding their care program where they said each child will increasingly recognize unfairness have language to describe unfairness and understand unfairness hurts each child will demonstrate empowerment and the skills to act with others or act alone against prejudice and or discriminatory action which none of this was going on within the schools and there there was no massive instances of this type of behavior the next slide is the drag queen that came to love it Eve Swallows this is a quote Christian school and this was on his open Instagram account this picture which all of the students of course pulled up who this person was and were watching his videos and performances the next slide is another one out of Westminster where it's bottom line showing the level of indoctrination going on there where they have bigot on a ten-year-olds spelling vocabulary list and where they direct the kids to get these definitions is dictionary.com where the definition was not every bigot is a conservative and not every conservative is a bigot below that or other examples to follow along with that in commentary happy to see limbaugh dead very inclusive the next slide is of the gender-bread person which is within a huge auditorium assembly area where middle school high school frequent the gender-bread man is a national figure at this point at hung in the foyer where all kids could check out this other example I guess not unlike the unicorn that's been traveling around here's the library at Westminster where they're handing out stickers they them all pronouns deserve a great haircut this book here it feels good to be yourself is out of Trinity School which is for three year olds up to six grade these are some excerpts out of the book regarding discussions of non-binary how kids can feel you know like a boy or a girl another slide from that the next one is from the Westminster schools it is a gender survey which students crafted and gave to their grade this is normally one of the big pillars of this indoctrination effort in building the programs to implement so normally this is done by the school or other organizations but here we have students sending out gender equality questioning regarding advantages or disadvantages of being the sex that they are this next slide is from a from a parent who left the love at school and listed to the school and their form all their concerns one why was the orchestra teacher explaining non-binary concepts to fifth graders with examples of how one can choose their gender in a fluid spectrum this is not relevant to grooming and other organizations why is a fifth grade teacher discussing her sister's sexuality with her students what is a fifth grade teacher correct a student commenting on a wedding making the couple mister and Mrs pointing out that to her it is doctor and mister what is the religion teacher explain what sex to is to third graders from an old testament story to discussion why are the history teachers teaching judgment of history rather than what the facts were so here is another slide from Woodward Academy another one of their outdoor club gatherings sexuality being front and center again the next slide is from Mill Springs Academy this is a smaller school north of here about their LGBT acceptance club and then this has been our message all along teach kids how to think and not what to think so in summary of what all of this is the weaponization of the language is purposeful and designed to confuse parents and children this pushback has nothing to do with the LGBTQ community or an adult's sexual preference as long as it doesn't involve children the irony is the push is only hurting the LGBTQ community children and teens whose minds and bodies are not fully developed being constantly barrage with sexual content conversations and political propaganda is damaging our children have a god-given right to an education free from these indoctrination this is not about a few egregious schools or rogue administrators and teachers this is calculated coordinated multi-prong effort to break down and destroy our society at the expense of our children so queer theory dismantles traditional assumptions about gender and sexual identities as well as biology and human creation it explores the oppressive power of dominant norms especially those of sexuality why is it not okay for some boys to just be more feminine in some girls more masculine why do children who don't fit a stereotype need to all of a sudden be swept up into confusion and distress by telling them maybe you should identify as the opposite sex I was a total tomboy that spent my afternoons climbing a muddy hill in our backyard looking for the best sticks and rocks and hating to wear the dresses my mother put me in had my mother label that behavior or told me something was wrong with how God made me I would have been devastated and traumatized and perhaps lower down a path that would have confused or caused distress the gay community has been hijacked and countless are speaking out against the sexualization of children as well the youth that are falling prey to this agenda are being used to destabilize society like communism they'll be discarded when the goal is reached children do not need this sexualized narrative pushed on them confusing them about their biology is a surefire way to cause tremendous anxiety depression and further insecurities it's no just it's no surprise middle illness is skyrocketing in our youth most of you probably have children and you know what a struggle the teen years are adults have jumped in and introduced drag queen story time adult entertainment curriculum with sexuality and gender ideology at the center as where as well as the queering of the catalog according to self proclaim Marxist lesbian head of the American Library Association which Texas and Montana just defunded the language of empathy belonging and inclusion is an effort to package something truly diabolical to appear positive and virtuous children's constitutional rights are being violated and it's being allowed let me ask you if you came up to a coworker and shared about your sexuality pictures and or content from a book like genderqueer or this book is gay what would happen if you engage with your interns about gay or straight sexual acts or reassure or pressure them to engage in conversations around sexuality how fast do you think human resources would be called and the likelihood of you losing your job or getting serious repercussions pretty likely this is what's going on in our schools but this is not only being allowed it is being encouraged the words hostile harassment and intimidation come to mind these words that need to be direct these are words that need to be directed at these schools administrators teachers and organizations coming for our children under the guise of diversity equity inclusion belonging and justice this effort to indoctrinate students has nothing to do with kindness including others or belonging it is an intentional effort to dismantle society and brainwash our youth through queer theory and political ideologies this is the easiest path to transformation and destabilization division between parents and children is also not only being allowed but discouraged but encouraged political power money is the greatest of motivators for many and this agenda is being executed at the expense of children there are leagues of organizations tied to this effort and feeding into the public and private schools the gay lesbian straight education network spectrum corny stando which is the hiring firm that plugs the most woke candidates from a pool of applicants the American Library Association again just defunded in Texas and Montana planned parenthood the Walton Ford and Rockefeller foundations the trans student educational resource which brought the country the gender unicorn not unlike the gender bread man as well as countless others feeding or funding progressive content in our schools leadership is bringing order to chaos what we are in is a perversion of leadership heads of schools Senate house representatives and state leaders have a responsibility to our children not adults pushing agendas the middle and physical health and safety need to be a priority this truly isn't and should not be a partisan issue leading innocent children down a path of woke ideologies when their minds are not fully developed is abuse we do not have a mass contagion of truly gender dysphoric children and teens we have a mass contagion of educators adults our government and organizations pushing this content into our public and private schools our children have fallen way behind in reading and math and deserve better the diversity equity and inclusion belonging and justice agenda is destroying this country education and society those individual words mean one thing the political effort quite another it is imperative we protect children in private schools the attack on them is more coordinated and methodical for obvious reasons of resources some of these private schools have endowments nearing four hundred million dollars they have a crediting organizations like the national association of independent schools and the southern association of independent schools mastermining and implementing this effort you must implore the legislators to protect the over hundred and fifty seven thousand students in Georgia's private schools your protection of them or decision not to will have profound consequences on our next generation of leaders and the nation in general the protection should follow the child wherever they go from this indoctrination in brainwashing private school parents have zero options in the metro area as it's completely eaten up with this cancer if parents try to speak out they are shut down punished and ostracized unless the general assembly votes to protect children no one can help them these private schools are getting subsidies from our government they're not subject to property or income tax so no matter public or private all children need protections and you are the last line of defense you have watched us fight an uphill battle tirelessly and now we need you thank you so much\n\nYour time. Thank you. So it's a thank you. Tom, thank you. Mr. I got Mr. Chairman. Let me just before you turn it over for questions. Just let me reintegrate and get to the crux of the matter. And I hope that she explained it extremely well. This is simply about the protection of children under the age of 16. Young people, young adults, wherever you want to call them. It has nothing to do with a political agenda. It's not Republican. It's not Democrat. It's not your sexual persuasion. These are your orientation. It is simply that children need to be, this needs to be handled by professionals. Not by someone who's hired to teach in math, science, arithmetic, whatever you want to talk about. They're not, that's not their job to orientate those children into what their beliefs are when it comes to sexual preference. Thank you. Let me have this time, Mr. Chairman. Thank you so much. Well, that's questions. Any questions from the committee? Senator Halpern. Thank you. I am going to ask you to forgive me because I got lost. So we started off saying that this is a bill only about gender, but in the discussions, it went completely to other places because I heard sexualization of children, which you said was specifically not in the bill. I heard injustice. I heard bigot. I heard DEI is destroying our country. And so I got lost. At the end of the day, here, well, let me just say, I've sat on a board and I've chaired a board of a private school here in Atlanta. And the reality is that sitting on that board, we actually had to understand and come to the recognition and the realization that there were children in our school community who were transgender children. We were accepting children into our school community who were transgender. We had students who were transitioning. And this was an elementary school, just elementary, not a high school. And so as a member of the board, we had to come to the recognition that this is something that was happening and we could either ignore it and not protect the students in our care. Or we could figure out a way to make sure that the parents and those children were able to be in the school community and not be completely ostracized. This is why I'm going to bring up the word belonging. Because belonging really is part of social emotional learning. And so I think I'm taking umbrage a little bit with the idea that the teacher's job is only to teach a rhythm. And I don't get me wrong. Now we need to do this well. They do need to teach kids at a read. They do need to teach kids how to do math. But are we are we no longer in agreement that that teachers are also helping to teach our kids belonging and social emotional experience and reasoning? I mean, isn't it true that we all have a favorite teacher that we can tell their name decades and decades later because of how that teacher made us feel and how that teacher accepted us for who we are? And so I'm confused because I don't feel like this bill is actually meaning to protect children. And I don't think it centers students at all. We really didn't talk about students and the children yet. And they also have agency. Do they not? I get where parents tend to be adults tend to be a whole lot less accepting than children. I sat on that board and saw and I saw an experience myself of a child who was transitioning from a young girl to a boy decided and just transitioning. Wanted to be called something different. A decision was made with the family about making sure that everybody in that classroom knew. And the teacher sat down and the child sat down with their classmates who had a conversation and all those kids were like, great, you want to be called Melissa? You're going to be called Melissa now. No big deal. And I feel like we're making a bigger deal out of some of these things than we need to. And don't get me wrong. I agree. Parents should be making choices. I'm not taking my children, for example, to drag time reading hours. That's not for me. In my family, I get where some of the hesitancy comes from. But I am wondering, again, the question really is, how then do you create a community of inclusion and a community of belonging? If you refuse to talk about any of the things that are actually happening in other children's life, how do we create children who can go out into the world, which is well beyond the four walls of their home and their parents, and be able to deal with the larger world when it comes time for them to. Because aren't we preparing our K through, forget K through 12? Because you said children under 16. So let's just say K through eight grade, nine grade, whatever. Aren't we really looking at our kindergartners today and not just saying, how do we get you through kindergarten? But aren't we saying, how do we get you to the time that you're 18 and going out into the world or 18 and going off to college? Isn't that really the job of our schools? Senator Helper, in your comments, yes, absolutely. I understand what you're coming from, but you answered the question perfectly. You said, with the parents involvement, and that's all we're saying here, is with the parents involvement or guardian. So then follow up. So we just had an experience here in Cobb County, where a teacher, because of a law that we passed, was fired. And it was a parent who brought up the complaint, and then the school board decided to fire that teacher. The tribunal decided that that was not the recommendation, the school board did it anyway. So then my question is, then how do you describe the rights of a parent over the rights of many other parents, then whose parent, which parent, gets to call the shots? In that issue, I would suggest, and I don't know the entire issue about that firing, but I would suggest that this bill perhaps would protect the teacher also if they're not talking to the kid about gender, and they're allowing the professional in the school to do so. But they are the professional in the school. They're professionals in that area, ma'am. They're in their area. One last follow up, and then I'll see to other people. Aren't our teachers professionally trained, and aren't they professionally trained? Aren't they given some training? This is a legit question. Aren't they given some training outside of just the math teacher? All I know is math. Well, in that case, I would suggest, and Tommy, what can we talk about? I would suggest that that teacher had had that training she wouldn't have been fired. I'm assuming so. No, I think it's the laws that, I think the implications of what we do in this room and obviously in our chamber and what we pass and what the governor's science has larger implications. Please Tom. Sir, I'm 12. 12? Completely understand where you're coming from. I think the difference is that they're, so for example, in your situation, a very free thinking school in which people are encouraged to have different ideas. What Ms. Hudson has described, what we've seen around the country to some extent, is specific gender curricula being taught. Again, this bill does two things. Number one, it simply allows, if it appears in a private school, if they, for example, biologically, they may be atheists who believe in biology and who do not want their children being taught that sex is on a spectrum, then they can opt out. The Cobb County situation, for example, I do believe that had, we had specific policies in that school about what would be taught when regarding gender issues. That number one that teacher may have, she said she didn't understand the book was about gender. That was her claim. The other thing, of course, is that I don't think necessarily a teacher, I really do not think. This is coming from my professional background. I don't think a teacher is equipped to talk to a child about gender dysphoria, period. If a teacher, if this is one of the things that I would like to see in the statewide policies, for example, that if a child approaches a public school teacher about feeling some gender dysphoria, feeling some discomfort in his or her own body, I don't want them saying, oh, well, let me tell you about the gender spectrum. Let me tell you about this. Let me tell you that if you feel like a girl in your male, that you can be a girl and to quote the WAB, one of the people of the way, the child said, I looked up and I realized that I don't have to be a dad. I can be a mom. Well, I'm sorry, but there are, if you go down the gender transition road, you're going into social transition, then you're going into puberty blockers and you're going into hormones and eventually across gender surgery, which puts the child on a track to have a lifetime of medical treatment required to maintain the alternate gender identity. So, I believe that teachers aren't equipped to deal with those issues, but yet instead, they should be, for example, referred to a school counselor. And I do believe that in less of situations, and you know they exist, if my child comes home and says they're transgender, I'm going to beat their butt, okay? We don't want that. We don't want that to happen, okay? We need to protect children who are in that situation. But at the same time, we also need to make sure that parents to the extent possible are involved in these very, very life-changing identity issues. On the curriculum issue, though, isn't it true, though, that right now, parents have the right and opportunity to their children out of certain curriculum? So like in the kid, I mean like, I know what you're saying. Yeah, you're talking about two different bills. Yeah. You're talking about curriculum and you're talking about unification. On the public school side, they can't opt out as understand what sex had. This bill actually in public schools doesn't address that. It just says let's have policies on it. And but on the private school, we do believe based upon the experiences of a lot of parents, especially in the metro at Laine, especially with the more elite schools, that the bargaining power between the parent and the school is so upside that the parents don't really have the option to say. I don't want this non-biological, what I believe, what they say, I believe, to be non-scientific. I don't want this being talked about my child, but they don't have the option to opt out. So in private schools, we're trying to give them that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you so much. Good to see everybody. It's been a few months. I want to just follow up and start with the private schools. It seems like the big picture here is discomfort in obviously a substantial portion of society with broader acceptance of gay individuals, individuals who don't subscribe. And by the way, there are plenty of scientists and child developmental doctors who will disagree with I think some of the testimony put forth that there is only biological gender. So there is first getting into, I mean, I'm sorry, biological sex, having to dictate all of that. There are plenty of experts and doctors out there who will firmly disagree with that. So we have to assess ourselves. We can't, in my opinion, be picking one set of, well, we're just going to go with this because we don't, we kind of don't like it when there are plenty of credentialed individuals who offer us something different. So the discomfort comes from these changing social mores and that's something that I certainly understand. But getting more specifically into a few things that have been raised today, you know, I feel like when it comes to the private schools, parents have a choice, do they not? So whether or not they want to spend $30 to $40,000 to send their children to basically all of the schools that were illustrated. I mean, this is not something that the government is voicing upon these parents. And I'm not sure at all, first of all, that it's an appropriate role for us to say that those schools can't do that because they are private schools by definition. And I would assume that the viewpoints shared today are simply not the majority of the viewpoints of the people who are attending those schools. They're just not the majority. And you know, in trying to force them into a different way of engaging with their parents and engaging with their children, isn't that in and of itself a political indoctrination? Who gets to decide what counts as political indoctrination? You may think it's this. Someone else may say, if that sort of thing can't be engaged with within my school, then the state has voisted political indoctrination onto our families with an opposite viewpoint. Thank you, Senator. Two things to your question. And I understand where you're coming from. Two things. Simply this. If a private school takes money out any form of fashion in regard to taxpayers' money, they would be affected. A school that absolutely takes nothing from assuming any kind of form of gold star taxpayer, any kind of function, doesn't participate with GHSA or any of that kind of stuff. They're on their own. I mean, we would have no jurisdiction in that level with that school. So yes, you're exactly right on that. If that. In regards to the other part of it, Senator, it goes back to the crux of the bill. Simply involve the parents. Allow them the ability to say, we want our children involved or we don't want our children involved. That's where I'm coming from. Thank you. Yes. Okay. Thank you, Senator. And let me just follow up with that. So in the, and Senator Halpern raised this already. In the example where due to partially changing social moreays and broader acceptance of a viewpoint that some children are indeed transgender or feel that their gender identity is incongruent with their biological sex and their parents are on a journey with them through it and the parents are involved. And they are as a family making certain choices. And the child presents at school. Or private or public. How is that school supposed to handle it? I mean, how can you say there can be, my point is I do not believe it is possible or advisable to shut down any discussion of those things, such things when they are going to present themselves in our children's lives. There's simply no way to decree that such things will not be discussed at all. And you might not like it, but it just is, it is what it is. My, my, my son's class has a transgender child. I'm not sure there's been any discussion of it. In fact, the only reason I know that the child's transgender is because the family came down to lobby against the last bill we passed. And I was like, oh, you know, no idea. I don't think the kids know. It's just not that big a deal. But were everyone to find out? And my son raised a question about it. Well, what are the teachers supposed to say? I mean, you put them in an impossible bind. So I would just respond to the extent that you're in a private school. It's not a question of not teaching about this. This is all that the private school only deals with teaching a formal gender curriculum, OK, first of all, and allows parents to opt out of that formal gender curriculum, which a parent should be allowed to do. So for example, a parent who believes that there is a biological binary, who doesn't want their child being in fifth grade, for example, being taught that sex is only spectrum. That parent might be able to opt out. But the other issue, of course, is that the school, especially the public schools, are going to be required to have policies about how to deal with this. The examples you've used all involve parents who were on board with their child's gender identity, who were involved with the school in discussing their child's gender identity. Unfortunately, there are a lot of cases lately, especially their specific policies in New Jersey and California, I think Minnesota, New York, fewer of the states, in which schools are prohibited from telling parents about a change in their child's gender identity. And that is what we were trying to address with this. Yes, and I understand that, Tom, and that seems a lot more reasonable than most of the testimony that was presented today. The fact of the matter is, most of these things, not only are they from private schools where their parents pay upwards of $37,000 per child to attend them, they are not dealing with the situation that you are claiming this bill is about. Are we against Mill Springs Academy having a LGBT acceptance club? Like is that getting, is that outlawed? The claim was made or the testimony was that this doesn't deal with gay children and that we were concerned about these gender identity discussions. This gingerbread, it says it was posted on the wall. I mean, with that under this bill be disallowed that it's not a curriculum. Right? And if my son said to their teacher, oh wow, I just found out that my friend is transgender and was born another sex. I take it and please correct me if I'm wrong, that my child, my son's teacher would be able to talk to my son about that, but they would not be able to present a curriculum without. They can still present a curriculum. They can absolutely present the curriculum. Let's say, for example, without the ascend of the parents. Well, the parent can opt out. One parent. So you can have a little, one child whose parents are completely opposed to this. They may be for religious grounds. They may be for biological science grounds. It may be the fact that they have a child, a male child who is likes to play with dolls is more feminine and they don't want the child getting the wrong idea that he can be a feminine boy. And so that family may want to opt out of a curriculum that teaches that sex is on a spectrum that if you feel feminine, but you're a male, then you may want to consider becoming transgender or non-binary. And that's a real issue. We got a few other questions up here. Senator Settler. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. The lady, thanks for being here. Thanks for your presentation. What I wrestle with in this is, I mean, when I look at this content shared, a person that's got some of this content and their identities, Eve Swallows, one might ask. It brings lots of questions. I, um, what's the concern? What is the sense in parents that's holding them at the schools? You mentioned Trinity Mills Springs, Love at Westminster, St. Martin's, Holyness, Woodward and maybe others, I may be I miss them. What is it that's holding parents at these schools when this kind of content is being shared with their kids? The parents don't just dust off their feet and say, you know what? Having BDSM symbols shared with my kids and Eve Swallows, but it is a mockery of the, we're done with you. Have your school show balls and change to kids with people and teach this in your schools, do your thing we're gone. Why is, what is it that's, I mean, and I'm not, I'm not, I'm not firing at you here. I'm just asking just to do, for why wouldn't parents say, you know what? I'm done with you. Never again, I'm not going to give you one penny of my money. You guys, I mean, and all that parents would want to say, well, why don't folks leave? Why is this an issue that we as a legislature have to come in and impose in statute requirements of private schools when common sense would tell me the parents would get together. They'd post this on social media. They'd make sure there's no lack of understanding that would be parents whose kids are, you know, in love it and they're, they're, they're going to get their interview before they get in kindergarten. They're hoping beyond hope. Maybe my kid gets accepted so they could start their 13 year journey at this elite school or other elite schools that, hey, understand what you're buying mom and dad. This, you're buying Eve Swallows. Why, why isn't that enough? How do we need to act as a lunch slash to address this? So I think the parents have come into these schools under the guise that it's, that they're buying something else. They're getting what their mission states. And you have the schools changing their missions and language to fit fit an agenda. So where all of this has been shared with parents for the past three years, four years, this content. There has been tremendous changes as far as people removing, you know, millions of dollars, you know, pledges that have been made, contributions, removing them from their state planning. They've pulled, some have pulled their kids, but others have maybe, you know, a ninth grader and a junior and it's like, well, you know, to pull them at this point when all of this has just come out is tough, obviously. And it's, you know, kids have their friends and their groups and, you know, they're comfortable in their school as far as this is where they've been for a number of years. And as well, I think for the parents, it takes tremendous blood, sweat and tears getting these kids into these schools that they deem to be the pinnacle, which they're not. And we've seen that. So where you have Westminster, love it, for example, saying we're now an inclusive Christian school. I mean, it's, you don't redefine Christianity. So you have, there's nothing wrong with including people belonging. All of that, those words and themselves, that goes without saying. So, so, Mr. Chairman, what I'm trying to get at here, my starting point is there's no way this legislature should ever, let me finish my sentence, there's no way this legislature should ever dictate things to private schools beyond the very minimum, which says, you know, four and a half hours of teaching in these, these base core subjects to be accredited and so forth. That's my starting point. What I'm trying to understand, though, is what you're saying is, if you accept the premise, we should never dictate things at private schools, which is certainly my starting point. I think it's, I think it's high-minded to keep, to not regulate things. What I'm hearing you say is two things. First, there's a, there's a property interest in kids being in a school. If you unpack, you know, scholarship opportunities, we incite the whole name engine likeness, the whole idea to, when you think about even access to getting into elite schools and the whole affirmative action stuff that went before the courts, there is a property interest that's been raised before that's tied to certain schools. Now, I don't know if the property interest is strong enough, but I'm just trying to understand and at least be clear about what you're saying. You believe there's a property interest that parents have. It's a social, the social piece of it where they feel they're in this great elite school and it feels so good to be a part of this. I think a lot of parents have a tough time separating themselves from that and saying, what's best for my child's heart, mind, spirit. So, and there's not a ton of options as we point out. I mean, there's, there's probably two that we know of that have said we're not teaching this type of curriculum. This is what we're, what we're putting out. Because I mean, you think about this and I'm just trying to unpack this and what we're going to ask that you're saying there's a property interest whether it's the social cohesion your kids have by being there. This perceived value of the name of the school and then if people certainly if they've made commitments to the foundation under the belief that it's a, it's a little o, it teaches historical Christianity but yet they're doing something different. There's this sort of this differential. Are you saying there's a fraud, I guess what I'm asking is there a fraud here? And I, because I don't know that we have an interest in doing what this bill does. I'm not really convinced we need to do this. But what I'm trying to understand is, is there a fraud that's being perpetrated? Like you're saying one thing which you're delivering another. And is there a property interest that's strong enough that tied to this fraud, this, this, this, this, this scheme, this deception scheme is enough to, to make the legislature jump in and want to actually enforce, in statute what a private school shall do. I mean, to me that's, that's a pretty high bar you got to clear there. I'm not sure I'm there yet because to me parents ought to say, you know what, I'm dusting off my feet. This place is there a lot. They got me in under a lie. They said they teach this and they're teaching that. Heck, others, other parents may choose the schools because they don't, they want this taught. We're in a free society. If you're, if you want to want this taught, go to these schools. Do it. Right. I'm not sure if you're going to be able to see it on some of that, that's some of the problems. So what I'm hearing you say is there's a fraud of some kind. There's a lie that's emerged that's tied to some property interest. Is that what I'm hearing? Well, let me just fucking just add to that. You got to remember, you know, let's say I send my child to an late school for the first four years and then they introduce a curriculum on an issue which, which, with which I vehemently disagree and I think it's wrong from my family. So you're putting me in the odd position of either having to destroy my child's friendships, yank my child out of the school, the only school here she is known and put them somewhere else when the easier role would be to make sure that those, that school, if it is receiving state funds, offers a parent the opportunity to opt out of one class for their child. Because Mr. Chairman, I just, I know you, we have limitations on that. I'm just concerned. Watch out what you ask for. We start tying state funds to these kinds of things. What's the next bill this committee is going to contemplate tying state funds, what's the next issue that state funds are going to get tied to? You know, where the shackles come, the shackles. My goal is to unshackle private schools and let them do their thing. This is to me another hook in private schools telling what they shall and shall not do. By the wisdom of this general assembly and I don't know that I trust myself or anybody in this panel decide what's best for schools, private schools beyond a real basic sort of reading, writing, arithmetic kind of things. I'm really, I'm just telling the author what I'm wrestling with is why should we put a requirement on schools when we ought to be lifting requirements off of schools, particularly when parents have the resources to leave. If they've got the ability to stroke a check, to go to Westminster, they've got the ability to they have the civic capacity there to make other choices.\n\nSo I'm just Mr. Chairman, I notice the hearing, I'm sharing where I'm at today. You got to clear a bar of why we're going to put a requirement on our private school when parents can say you know what this place is, bunch of liars. They suckered me in saying they were this and they're doing this then leave. Other parents who like the philosophy, let them come in and be part of the school. So that's where I'm at, Mr. Chairman, and I'm trying to weigh this out because we have it clear a pretty high bar to put extra requirements on private schools. Thanks, Senator, Senator Eckles. Thank you. Oh, you're good. Okay. We'll move on to hearing from the audience, from testimony, from speakers that have signed up. First speaker is Brian Nunez. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And then also, you know, we are limited on time today. This is a hearing only. There will be further hearings where folks know that. We're going to hold everybody to two minutes. And then also, you know, we've got over 40 speakers signed up. If someone goes before you and they say, you know, the same thing, if I get to you and you'd rather pass, that would be great to keep things moving along. Or if there's a group of you here together, there may not be. But if there is, elect one speaker and you have the other folks with you stand up just so we know you're there. And we've got a list and everybody on the committee does knows that there's a lot of folks in opposition to this bill. So thank you. Please go ahead, sir. Good morning, Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Brian Nunez. I'm the Georgia Popsist, Associate for the S. Bill's Department of Fund. We are dedicated to safeguarding the civil and human rights of all people. The bill adds another layer of legal responsibility for educators and school personnel who, although on training, are required to report a child's expression of gender dysphoria to their parents. This could school administrators in the position of having students who are in dangerous home situations possibly putting them in the face of abusive or hostile parents. This legislation would essentially prevent young teens struggling from seeking any advice from trusted adults in their lives. This is a recipe for youth suicide. Two suicide rates among transgender youth are significantly higher than their peers, requiring a math teacher or coach to maybe the child's only trusted a dormant or to violate the child's trust should have best-based consequences. In fact, at least four transgender youth attempt to suicide following a similar bill passage in Arkansas. This legislation is a solution in search of a problem. Schools are not being made trans by schools. Schools that have policies which recognize the civil rights of trans kids are following federal law and any attempt to interfere in those rights might put a school at odds with federal statutes and the Constitution. Schools that recognize the humanity of trans kids by affirming their identities are not creating other trans kids and should be penalized for putting the well-being of kids ahead of those who attack with the above pseudoscience, one of the most vulnerable populations in the country's political capital. These kids don't wear red or blue jerseys. They simply want to show the says, me. Rather than imposing artificial barriers to helping LGBTQ youth because of inaccurate sex stereotypes and prejudice, we should be providing age-to-popping resources for students who are struggling. This legislation communicates to our LGBT kids that will rather harm them than help them. Let me just mention one last sentence. This committee should not express to our LGBT kids in the state that your priorities are to harm them than to rather help them. Thank you very much. Next speaker is Mel Cutner. And then the next speaker after that is Cindy Battles. Morning committee. My name is Mel Cutner and I'm here from the Deep Sender in Savannah, Georgia. So I was up at 330 in the morning to get here. I'm glad I made it. We are a community-based organization focused on youth leadership through civic education. We focus on developing community-driven, pragmatic, but hopeful visions of what schools could look like and achieve for all students. I just want to share with you some of the things we've heard from teachers and students this summer. They want stronger connections between schools, farmers, and the ecosystem. They want better instruction on finance and media literacy. And they want opportunities to build meaningful relationships with other educators and students in the schools so they can meet their academic needs. I'm not a lobbyist, so I'm a little bit nervous. You're doing a great job. More importantly, one thing that they said is they want to feel respected and valued by decision-makers. They want their voices heard. And I think this point is really important for Georgia and for this bill. This is a point that we heard across the state, across the geography and political party. We heard in a 2015 report, in a 2022 report that explored the importance of teacher retention in burnout in Georgia schools. The current superintendent named it as one of the most pressing issues that are challenging our times. Those like SB 88 are part of the problem of teacher burnout in retention. From the 50 educators and students we heard from local private and public schools in Savannah, not in New Jersey or Minnesota or Texas. They, including teachers and a point to self-indignify and want me to tell you that they lean politically conservative, they find this bill demoralizing, disrespectful, and disconnected to the realities and critical thinking capacities of young people and educators. Many of whom, by the way, are parents. It's not educators versus parents. I'll be really fast. So at the Deep Center, we will continue to show up and advocate against bills like this. And we hear from our educators and our young people about the impact it will have. And when the bills are authored, when the bills authors introduce them in that likeens conversations about gender identity, terational and indoctrination, or when a legislative body that recently, in the last two years, in the last 30 minutes of legislative session, tracked on an anti-transport bill to a so-called divisive concept bill. We just, for me, want to shame on you for me twice, shame on me. All that said, we'd rather be here and bring our young people and educators here to have pragmatic but hopeful conversations, bipartisan conversations. We'd love to bring young people in talk with Senator Payne about school discipline tribunals. Our problems that our young people are facing are bipartisan. We don't have to let policy be reduced or subsumed by few fringe parents in partisan talking points. Thank you so much. Thank you. Cindy Battles. And then next up is Reverend L.S. Allen? Reverend Allen can't be here. Reverend Allen is in DC. Okay. Thank you. I just wanted to lay you know. Hi, my name is Cindy Battles and I am the Director of Policy and Engagement for the Georgia Coalition for the People's Agenda. And I came here to talk to you all today as a parent. As a queer parent of a queer child. I was going to beg you to hear me when I said that even with an accepting mother, my child depended on her teachers and their support to literally save her life. But I'm also going to be really honest because despite what the sponsor of the bill has said, I've listened to the presenter and Mr. Rawlens who would beat their child for being transgender. And you know, I did not. I did not. So we're going to keep a quorum here like you said. We're on a tight schedule. What I heard was if my child came home and said, I am transgender, I would beat their butt. So, so let me finish and then you can clarify. We have sat here and listened to examples that have exempted queer children and made them feel unwelcome. And I want to apologize to the people in this room who have felt that way. I want to remind you all again that my child relied on teachers and staff at schools to feel supported as she addressed who she is as a person. I want to remind you all that I recognize that you have some sort of polling that shows there's 80% support. But that poll didn't ask, hey, should we focus on this or should we focus on maternity rights or income inequity or any of those things? It was literally, how can we come for the LGBTQ community in a way that you will support it? And this was what y'all chose. There are other things. If we want to protect kids, I got a good idea. Let's do a quick Google search on how many children are going to church and being sexually assaulted by church leaders and less legislation to protect them. This bill does not protect children. It ostracizes an already at risk community of kids. Thank you. We got Francesca Raul. Sorry if I pronounced that wrong. And then on deck is Jeff Graham. Hi, my name is Francesca Raul. And I'm here as a student of volunteering my experience in testimony to this committee today. So good morning to the committee. I'm a second year student at Georgia State. And I spent 12 years growing up in Atlanta Public Schools. And for my experience, I can tell you that students are real people. They have their own lives. They have their own questions about the world. And they have their own experiences and identities to deal with. To float this bill, treating minors as anything other than human beings with complex identities, some of which will inevitably not be the gender assigned to them at birth is a disgrace. Right now, there's valuable education legislation going through this building. Teachers need better pay and more respect by this body and this committee. Students need counselors as schools are more overwhelmed than ever. Last year, something life changing happened when the hope scholarship got expanded and my tuition and many other Georgia and kids tuition was expanded to 100% coverage. There is valuable legislation. So let's focus on something worth our time, please, instead of fear mongering on an ony issue. The watered downation of nature of this bill still puts a target on the back of a very vulnerable demographic of kids. The sponsor of this bill, Cardin Summers, said last year after the passage of the anti-trans bill, Senate Bill 140, which just got struck down in a junction by the way, that he was done passing this type of bigoted, hateful legislation. Senate Bill 140 was just struck down by a judge as unconstitutional until further ruling. And now, Senator Summers is back with the same stick. This is transparent and it's embarrassing. I urge the committee to consider this bill unavorably. Thank you. Next up is Jeff Graham. And then on deck is Zina Mohamed. I want to thank members of the committee for your continued work on this bill. Senator Summers, I know that you've worked hard on this to address many of the concerns that were brought before. Unfortunately, there are still so many issues within this legislation. Committee compels me to stand up here on behalf of Georgia Equality, the 425,000 members of the LGBTQ community throughout the state of Georgia that we represent, and the millions of friends, families, and allies of LGBTQ Georgians that are affected by legislation like this. There will be others that will talk about the challenges presented by the vague language, the administrative burden that it presents upon educators. But my greatest concern is that there is no reason to single out the topic of gender identity for specific policy, rules, or regulation. There has always been and always will be students who identify as transgender or whose own sense of gender identity doesn't fit neatly into a specific binary box. This legislation will only add to the stigma they face and make their lives more challenging and difficult. These debates distract from the important work that this body has done and continues to do to address the mental health needs of Georgians of all ages. In a Trevor Project poll released in January of this year, 71% of LGBTQ youth, including 86% of transgender and non-binary youth, said state laws restricting the rights of LGBTQ young people have negatively impacted their mental health. A majority of those trans youth, 55%, said it impacted their mental health very negatively, opposing these harmful pieces of legislation as a necessary component of suicide prevention. The introduction of Bill after Bill, targeting members of the LGBT community for special scrutiny, is also having a dangerous ripple effect. This past weekend, a 66-year-old mother of nine, was shot and killed outside of her business for displaying a pride flag. While that incident didn't happen here in Georgia, it is the product of the fact that nearly 600 anti-LGBT bills have been introduced around the country in 2023. For half a dozen of them introduced here in Georgia. While this level of violence last month, we saw Nazis protesting in Macon and in Cobb County and that same group of Nazis hung an effigy of someone draped in a pride flag and is believed to have distributed hundreds, if not thousands, of anti-trans and anti-Semitic literature in communities and neighborhoods throughout the metro-Atlantic area. These are the issues that we should be concerned about not perpetuating this stigma against already vulnerable youth. Thank you. We're seeing a Mohammed. Thank you. Thank you. Then we got Kaylee Hargrove. Then on deck is Brooke Rapport. Thank you for providing me the opportunity to speak today. I am an ordained Reverend in the Disciples of Christ. I am a mother of two children, one of them being a teenager under the age of 16. Speaking from my own denomination, our denomination, opposing the narrative that was just given about Christianity, has stated at our general level that we oppose all legislation that would be targeted against LGBTQ plus students. Children. To say that it is a Christian narrative is in fact wrong and does not respect the totality of Christianity. Second, regardless of the ad hominem and stromand attempts that were used to use the select pieces of information to create a narrative from an organization that has already lost a lawsuit saying that they misrepresented certain information, I think that it is important that we actually share a real narrative that is going on. I have a real concern that the person sponsoring this bill doesn't know about something that relates to his bill that happened just weeks ago. According to Project Veritas, pushing gender identity is abuse. Which and during the court case against SB 140, the defendants pushed that pushing gender identity was a concern. Under this bill, this would limit teachers who are mandatory reporters, would limit them from reporting whenever gender identity is being pushed on a child even under those circumstances. So if a cisgender child is being pushed to be being transgender, they could not go to their teacher and report it because the teacher is forbidden from taking that information. So under the worries of the same senator that is proposing this bill, those worries cannot be actually reported as abuse. So this bill does not actually represent what the sponsor is even trying to do. Thank you. Thank you. And on deck is Barbara Walters? Sorry, did you say Barbara before? No, on deck. The next she's up there. Okay, sorry. First time I was sleeping a lot up here. I was starting to think it was just for show. So it's nice to see you again, Camden. I always thought that. If you said gender identity in a mirror three times that you show up, but I guess it's true. So here we are. Now the chairman here was talking about how sex is a binary. And that's a funny thing because I'm intersex. And he's insisting that I apparently don't exist, which is really, of course, in some right here. But how do you even answer to that? That sex is a binary where my exx-y chromosomes say otherwise. That somehow it's this perversion that doesn't exist. And yet you're talking about beating your child for what your own perception of what is perversion, not perverse. And I have to ask, what is the point of this? This bill doesn't make any sense. You're talking about indoctrination in public, I mean, sorry, private schools. But I went to a private school. It was an orthodox religious school. We were talking about Moses, not gender. We were talking about God's relationship with Abraham, not sex and BDSM. And no one really attached to this bill seems to be able to come up with a single example of any of this material being disseminated in a private school. Yet here we are. So I have to wonder if this is just pushing an ulterior motive or an agenda for political points in the upcoming election. One of this bill makes sense. Even the bill's sponsor attached to his contradicted the language of their own bill in this hearing. And what are we even doing here? A signed die was months ago. All right, that's all I got. And I do want to make a clarification, y'all back where the microphones y'all may not have heard it very well. But one of the presenters was not talking about his child. He was using an example. So you just want to clarify that with the audience as we keep hearing that from presenters. Thank you. In his defense, the audience did misunderstand. He was saying if someone was the type of parent who was doing that, then the bill would not apply. If they were the type, if it does talk about maltreatment, if there was a parent like that, which is what he was talking about, then the bill would not apply. I do have known time a long time, so I do want to clarify for everybody that we understood up here that he was not saying he would be his child. Thank you. Next speaker is Barbara Walters. And then on deck is Lisa Morgan. Okay. That appeared Barbara's here. Lisa Morgan. I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman, she has to be our head. Okay. Thank you for. Oh, we've got somebody with my last name. Maya Dixon. No. It's Brandon. Yes. All right. Hi, everybody. My name is Maya Dixon. I'm a college student and graduated from Gwinnett County. I've always existed like this. I've been this person that wears this clothes, plays the sports I like, does the things. As much as you may hate queer people and you wish that we don't exist and that we don't exist in the classroom, creating these legislations and these policies that hurt us will not erase us. We are here whether you like it or not. And fun fact about me, I never actually came out or discovered my sexuality. The closet was built around me. I was told how to hate myself. I was told what was wrong with me, what about being queer and about presenting the way that I do and the way that I express my gender was wrong. You Christians, you policymakers who claim to love me and support me as a student and as a constituent. Clearly, don't. You told me what was wrong. And if you really cared about the well-being of students, you'd fix their lead lace pipes and you'd fully fund their classrooms. You'd support students living in poverty and you'd help the holistic challenges that students and their families face. I know you may not care what I have to say, but I am your constituent and I wish that you would pass legislation that valued and supported queer students like myself rather than just trying to raise money and support for the next election. Thank you. Thank you for your comments. Grateful for you being here, but this is not my legislation. I just chair this committee just for clarification. Justin Paulie is up next. And then, Errol Anderson is on deck. Good morning, Chairman, committee members. I'm Justin Paulie with the Georgia School Boards Association. Appreciate the opportunity to speak today. The GSBA represents locally elected public school boards all over the state. Our goal today is not to debate the social or philosophical issues here because every community in school district is different. What works in one part of the state is different from what may work in another part of the state. By and large school districts are working on these situations with families on a case-by-case basis and have been for many years. When we look at the legislation, we do have some recommendations for consideration that address implementation. We have outlined our recommendations in the copy of the bill that was provided by Senate staff. But in the interest of time, I've brought hard copies for your consideration and we'll also send electronic copy as well. Chairman, with your permission, we would like to just share this information with the sponsor and the committee and with that, I conclude my remarks. Thank you for the opportunity. Thank you. Yeah, that would be great. Thank you so much. We'd extend it to me. Oh, you have a hand. Sure. You have a hand. All right. An arrow, Anderson. I'd like to ask you. Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I may be saying that wrong. I apologize if I am. Thanks. I'll get it all the time. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Good morning, Chairman Dixon and members of the committee. My name is Neckah, and my pronouns are they then. And I'm a staff attorney at the ACLU of Georgia. The ACLU of Georgia opposes SB 88 because transgender students deserve safety and equity in the classroom. SB 88 is an intrusion into First Amendment rights. The bill creates a stigma around LGBTQ topics requiring unnecessary policies and procedures before educators can discuss the basic premise that transgender people exist. These procedures will chill educator speech based on the speech of subject matter and exclude transgender related topics in the classroom, resulting in a content-based restriction. By codifying an explicit prohibition on the perspective that gender can be fluid and that a science-dexat birth can lack nuance, SB 88 also engages in viewpoint discrimination. Both content-based restrictions and viewpoint discrimination are presentively unconstitutional under the violations of the First Amendment. SB 88 is also flattily vague. For example, the bill requires parental permission before an educator can, quote, unquote, address issues relating to transgender topics. It is unclear, however, how far this requirement would go and whether it applies to the mere mention of a transgender author, activist, or historical figure, not even to mention the experience of a transgender child in the classroom. The bill would require policies to incorporate appropriate parental involvement, but does not specify the minimum amount of parental involvement that would satisfy the requirements. SB 88 does not provide clear guidelines to municipal school boards or educators themselves to comply with the bill's requirements and is therefore impermissible vague. Gender students are first and foremost students. No child deserves to feel marginalized in the classroom, but SB 88 would do just that. Educators should be able to teach equitable and inclusive curriculum, but SB 88 would prohibit them from doing so. Should this legislature pass this bill, the ACLU of Georgia is committed to fighting SB 88 on all fronts. The ACLU of Georgia opposes this bill. Thank you. Thank you. My name is Marjorie Pock. I use she her pronouns. I have two kids in public schools. I'm opposed to SB 88. This bill starts out by saying that there's been a significant increase recently and the number of children identifying as transgender. It never tells us why that's supposed to be a problem or why schools and teachers need to be threatened with punishment for it. I look at my teenager and his friends, many of whom are transgender, non-binary or queer, and I don't see a problem. I see kids who are funny and smart and brave and kind and involved in all kinds of activities in their schools and communities. None of these kids learn to be transgender from a teacher and bills like this won't stop kids from being transgender. But these bills will do other kinds of harm. SB 88 imposes extensive demands on districts and threatens schools and teachers with punishment for non-compliance. It claims to be about parents' rights, but it ignores parents like me who simply want to love and support our kids and who would like school to be a place where they're protected from bigotry rather than laid open to it. This bill would distract school professionals from more important work and a road trust between children, teachers, and parents. And by turning gender identity into a taboo subject at school, it could have the disastrous effect of isolating and silencing a child in distress. All of this harm is unnecessary. A mere increase in the number of transgender youth, while it may make some people uncomfortable and afraid, is not itself a problem that calls for punitive legislation. And it is wrong to use the law against children and teachers out of a fear of difference. Thank you. Thank you. Pamela Griffin. Oh, for on that, right? After. Yeah. Thanks. Hi, everyone. My name is Alisa Barnett. I recently received my master's degree in public health from Emory University, and I'm also a returned Peace Corps volunteer who focused on sexual and reproductive health and HIV prevention in Lusutu and served the US in that role. I wanted to talk a little bit about the public health perspective on outcomes from this bill. We have clear evidence from decades of research that sexual and reproductive health increases health outcomes, sorry, sexual and reproductive health education increases health outcomes for people of all ages, especially youth. And school is an important part in promoting sexual and reproductive health.\n\nOutside of just sexual health education in schools, conversations of gender can often appear in other subjects, including literature, social studies, and so on. These conversations can surround puberty, body anatomy, and even gender presentation from an individual perspective for youth in sexual health studies, but also in other subjects, especially literature. There was a discussion today of protecting gender-expanded civil youth from poor mental health outcomes, and for many youth learning, just understanding what gender is and how that might relate to them can increase their mental health. So by censoring the ability for teachers to engage in this type of conversation, again, we know that this type of bill can reduce mental health outcomes for youth. So finally, the truth of the matter is that through this bill we're regulating teachers, we're not giving autonomy to youth to know their own bodies, and we're stigmatizing gender-expansive identity. Please oppose this. Please do not vote on this bill. Thank you. Thank you. Pamela Griffin in Nicole Trinzkowski makes it that round. His own deck. Is Nicole here? And we've got Kendall Schneider, Katherine Ivey, moving around along. And a theater. It's a non-ya. Here. Good. No. I can be non-ya. Okay. That works. Senator Summer said that the gist of the bills is to make sure kids don't discuss identity with adults at school, and that parents need to be informed of any questioning of their gender identity or of a child exhibits any question of their gender identity. If a parent is supportive, there's no issue. I think what we're really discussing is a right for a parent to know when they are not supportive. When a child is in an unsupported home, which is why they would likely be suicidal or scared to begin with, if we put them in a position where we inform their parents, they would likely be more traumatized and more suicidal. The response will likely be fine, involve the authorities. It would take months, thousands of dollars of government funded dollars to evaluate inspect and address these issues and put children into an already overburdened system for foster care and removing these children from their parents. 56% of trans youth have committed, tried to commit suicide, not because it's a mental condition or something is wrong with them, but more because they're afraid of coming out. They're afraid of being in an unsupported environment, and I know because I was one of them. I was born a biological boy, and I attempted suicide four times before I was 14. I'm a farming adult. I'm a farming adult. Reduces the chance of suicide by over 40% in these children. The National Institutes for Health says that if we were to look at these statistics, 56 kids would try to commit suicide. I'm going to break these numbers down for you also, you can actually understand in children's lives. Let's take 100 students, that's 56 kids. 30% of that is 22 children's lives you can save. If you are asking to protect children, and that is your concern, I am asking you today, protect children. Save people's lives, and that's 100 children. If we're talking about thousands of children who identify as TGX across the state of Georgia, then save those lives. Thank you so much. My name is Farah Zassayat. Thank you. And then we've got Christopher and Judy Scayer. Yep. Oh. Yep. Oh. Hmm. Cool. Okay. My name is Chris Scayer. I'm the father of a non-binary transgender. 23 year old. I'm at this hearing because I want to get public testimony to oppose it. Okay. I got this. I'm opposed it because SB 40 creates a special policy just for gender identity that is targeting transgender youth, transgender youth are already very vulnerable and different. And in schools and in society, make them feel that way already. Instead of stigmatizing these children and these kids, we should be lifting them up and supporting them so they can succeed in life. Plus, I, you know, this is just going to give more burden to the students, to the teachers. They're already overworked. They don't need this. So I'm just here to support transgender children because if me as a parent isn't standing up here and saying, this is wrong, the who is. Thank you. Thank you for coming. Got Maya Nelson. And then Maya. And then we've got, next would be Mason Goodwin. Hello committee. My name is Mason Goodwin. I'm with the Georgia Youth Justice Coalition and I'm a student at Georgia State. I mean, after that, I'm frankly really fucking tired of showing up here for this whole one second. We're not going to use profanity in here. I'm sorry, but why is this what this body's focused on? Why did y'all get together in August for this to be the focus of this committee? You're the education committee. There are other problems in our schools, mental health issues. We just got out of the pandemic. Why is this this body's focus? Why? Y'all are all paid to be here to do your jobs responsibly. This is not responsible at all and I'm tired of being here. Everyone here is tired of being here and I'm sorry y'all got to deal with me like this, but we're sick of it. Why? We have a 40 year old QBE formula, 40 years old. Why aren't we looking of how we could revise that formula? Why aren't we addressing poverty? Why aren't we helping our rural schools? Why is this this focus, Chair, the sponsor of this bill said last year to me in Francesca that he wouldn't do this anymore after 140. He knew he got himself into after a parent's came time and time again to stop this bill. To stop this bill as well. You've tried for two years. You passed the advice of concepts. The person who sponsored the advice of concepts in the house said the bill didn't work as intended. We don't know what we're doing with these pieces of legislation because none of you are queer. None of you all understand the experience of students who are queer and they should be the ones deciding the pieces of legislation that will help them. So I am begging y'all, do not go forward with this. Talk to students who do have to actually deal with these issues in the classroom because y'all have not been in the classroom forever. I mean that in the most respectable way. Thank you. Thank you for your comments. All right, next. Thank you. Next up, Jordan Black. And then on deck Joshua Hacley. Hadley. Hi, first time speaker. I stand as a mom. My children do not go to an elite private Christian school. They go to a regular old public school in Gwinnett County. And to my knowledge, my family is the first in our school to have a child transition in that school. And it is hard to be the first. So I read my comment with that perspective. My name is Jordan Black. My pronouns are she, her. And I stand in opposition to SB 88. This bill will impact my child's learning experience in Gwinnett County Public Elementary School by directly contributing to a learning environment where my child cannot fully express who he is. The job of local public schools in Georgia is to educate its children and keep them safe. And if Georgia teachers are unable to interact with my child in the full expression of who he is, my child will go to school feeling isolated and afraid. A recent school climate study shows that transgender and non-binary students at schools with inclusive policies are less likely to skip school or experience victimization or harassment. When you separate out a demographic as this bill does, the result is nothing less than the dehumanization of the children this bill targets. So I ask that you stand with Georgia families like my own and against SB 88. Before the next speaker, Senator Settler would like to make a comment. I appreciate the ladies presentation that was a professional, thoughtful, and probative Senator Marks. So thank you. I will say there's been some impassioned speeches up here, one in particular that's talking about how detached members of this panel are from anything that's happened in the classroom. We've got people in this panel who spent over 30 years in the classroom. Spend lots of times in our schools. If you get a come here and you're going to make this impassioned speech like, hey, we're going to be this student that speaks truth to power. Come here. Come speak. We want to hear you. But to stand and make accusations that we're not funding education at all. We have the highest pay teachers in the Southeast United States. We spend a higher percentage of education of our state budget, our state budget on education, as a state, as a percentage of our total state spending, than any state in the nation. We spend more of Atlanta's resources, Metro Atlanta's wealth, funding education in rural districts than any state in the nation. We have done things for rural health care. We are funding scholarships for clinicians to go and provide health care in rural areas. We are providing record levels of funding for folks who are in need through our state health care system, through our strategic waiver program. The folks who are not funding are single, healthy, young people who can work and choose not to work. Other folks in need are being funded. So, if you're going to come here and committee and speak speak, but do it substantively, own the facts. And if you're going to step up, let's have comments that address the issues themselves and that are factual. Don't make the impassioned plea make generational attacks on the people in this panel and then leave with applause. That's not what you come here for. We come here for debate. Come here, let's be engaged in debate. Let's talk substantively. I just say all this to say, I'm going to wrap up Mr. Chair. Let's debate this, this is a very serious bill. We've had people on both sides of this bill who've brought various substantive remarks. I thank people on both sides of the question. Let's just stop making locker room speeches and let's address the facts and I appreciate the folks on both sides who've done that. Next up, Joshua. Thank you. Good morning. I'm Joshua Hadley and my pronouns are he, him and I'm speaking opposition to Senate Bill 88. As the parent of a transgender child, this bill would create barriers for my student to advocate for himself and his needs within the school by creating an environment where teachers and other trusted adults are uncertain about what conversations are allowable or prohibited from having those conversations at all. We tell our children that their teenage years are preparation and practice for adulthood. Sometimes they're really bad at it, but the practice is what's important. This is a time when we should be providing more resources for our schools to support their students, not limiting what tools they can use or conversations they can have. Having an openly supportive household and school reduces, greatly reduces suicide attempts by your transgender youth. Opposing this bill quite literally means that more of our children reach adulthood. I'm a person of faith. I taught my elementary Sunday school at my local Baptist church for almost a decade. We read the Bible. We taught Christ lessons of love and compassion. We extended that to all people, especially the downtrodden and marginalized. Galatians 3, 28 and 29 says, there is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free. Nor is their male and female for your all one in Christ Jesus. If you belong to Christ, your Abraham's offspring airs according to the promise. As Christians, we ask ourselves all the time, what would Jesus do? If we're reading the same Bible, he would oppose SB 88. Parental rights didn't matter when SB 140 was passed earlier this year. Why are we pretending that that's what this is about and that those rights matter now? Thank you. Thank you. Sydney, Jamont. Carol Maddox is on deck. Hello, my name is Dr. Jamont. I'm here today as a parent and of a child who goes to private school, which I specifically elected for her because I want her to have a diverse education. I really just want to echo the sentiments of everyone who has been in opposition over this bill today. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Hi, I'm Carol Maddox with the Georgia Interfaith Public Policy Center and I think the chairman and this committee for giving us time. My board is made up of faith leaders from across the state of Georgia that lead over a half of million Georgians in their religion. We have some concerns about the wording of this bill that I talked to our chancellor who is, like, a Pisco speak for attorney. In conjunction with him, we'd like to say this. It appears that the proposed changes would make to the language of this bill, which originally excluded any organizations that were run by a religion or a church. So it would now apply to religious schools, camps, and other institutions and we think that it should not do so. Any intrusion by the state and church affairs that does not involve such matters as public safety creates all sorts of potential problems and constitutional issues. It should not be undertaken without serious consideration and only with compelling need. Telling a faith leader what he or she can say in the performance of his or her duties is something the state should not be involved with. The substitute language of the bill does not protect the rights of the religious institutions and would create enormous problems of interpretation. It would, for example, require camp staff to determine what these controversial subjects are covered or whether they're covered by the tenets of a particular denomination involved. It would require them to distinguish a tenant from a widely held belief, for example. Scholars debate the meaning of biblical passages touching on issues of sexuality and it is impractical to require camp staffs, for example, or teachers, to figure out exactly what a faith's tenets are on these issues in order to prepare a curriculum that affects this. I am glad that the earlier speaker found a church, I mean, found a school that she found acceptable for her children and I'm hopeful that she also has found a faith community that reflects her values. That is a constitutional right for all of us. Thank you. Thank you for your comments. We got Kate Morgan and then on deck is Mateo Pignato. I'm Kate Morgan and I use she, her pronouns and I speak in strong opposition to SB 88. As a former long term substitute teacher and public school employee, there are many issues that plague the public school system. I actually did have a six grade student who was a trans boy and I can tell you right now trans kids are not one of them. But I can tell you about some of the real issues that we did have because this bill actually creates issues that are not there. The biggest one was the fact that there was a lack of discipline and support from my admins. I had very little training and was inadequate because as you all know, we have a teacher shortage just like we did a few years ago. There was also even a school shooting threat in my classroom and I never felt safe. And I also will note that I live in Gwyneth County, one of the best school districts in the state. Parents that agree with current practices in public schools, they are welcome to go to a private school or home school their children. Many people do it and frankly it's not my problem as a taxpayer if they don't agree with what is being taught in public schools because instead of wasting my tax dollars as a origin by creating problems that aren't there, you could actually fix real problems in education. As mentioned this is not one of them. I will also add that there are many trans non-binary and LGBT people not just in this room but in the real world and your kids will be interacting with them. So I think it would be better to leave trans kids alone because they are not the problem, both like this or the problem. Thank you. Thank you. Mateo? No. Thank you. Mateo couldn't be here so they let me have their time. Hey everybody, my name is Bentley Hudgens. And I just, and I rise an opposition to Senate Bill 88. Thank you for letting me be here today and giving us the time to talk to you. There's a couple of things that I wanted to address. So I am the child of a public school teacher. She's retired. She taught first grade in Henry County for 30 years. My aunt is a retired teacher. My god, my mother's a retired teacher. I came from a family of educators and I grew up with a lot of teachers around me and I can tell you I had never once had a teacher tell me, you know what I wish the state would do, tell me how to do things more. The thing that I get told the most is that how they feel that they've lost the art of teaching and that teachers are caught up in regulations and they're caught up in requirements on reporting and all this other paperwork instead of being able to actually spend time with the children that they care so much about. So I just wanted to give offer that. In addition, when you talk about in this bill, not only the nebulous language and the vagueness and some of the self-contradictions, I do agree with some of the points made earlier that even with the use senator's set, I know we don't always agree but the fact that the state should not be telling a private school to what to do. Like we both agree on that and especially if those are of religious backgrounds. In addition, there's just a couple of things. So when we limit or require what we're reporting, when we talk about gender or gender identity, it's not just queer gender or queer gender identity. That's not what's outlined in this bill. So we couldn't even talk about what it means to be, you know, what maybe carbon would say or say that or something which would say is a real man or we couldn't talk about even normal quote unquote ideas of what manhood or womanhood looks like. So not only are you limiting discussion for queer people, you're also limiting discussion for yourself and people who believe in things like yourself. So I just wanted to point out the fact that don't cut your nose despite your face here. We need to be very careful. Not only would you be limiting the ability to talk about gender in a thoughtful and empathetic way, you'd also be limiting discussion to talk about it at all. And we deserve for our children to be able to have the full education they deserve. Not just based on a few French parents, you don't believe in science. Thank you. Madeline Brown. And we've got Gloria Gray Clifton. And then we've got Jody Braswell. Hello. Hi, my name is Sarah Higden and I'm a transsexual woman and I'm here to speak in favor of SB 88. Having gone through the process of transition myself, I can tell you that it's not an easy process that if a child is questioning their identity, then they need the help of a trans psychological professional. And its parents' responsibility is to make sure their child gets that care. Not a school teacher, not a school, but the parents. And the fact is teachers are not trained therapist. So they are not exactly trained to deal with true psychological phenomenon that is sexual confusion in children. And we know this happens in schools. We know what happens in schools when they keep secrets from parents. And the most extreme case is we have what happened to a young girl in Florida and you can look this up. A child's gender issues were kept in the parents because of their Catholic faith if you can believe that. That child went on to attempt suicide twice in as many days and the parents were left in the dark that their child was even having these issues. I know from the old, the old time you can see for SB 140 that you all care about suicide. So my question is why would you think it's okay to keep these children from getting the help that they need and deserve? Parents are the only ones that can do that and unless there's clear abuse going on which the schools then have an action that they are dictated by law to take, then it has no right to keep that life saving treatment from parents. Thank you. Thank you for your comments. Anna Velasso, I may have said that wrong. I apologize if I did. Anna can be here today so I'm going to speak in Anna's behalf. My name is Rachel Ward, Danette. Oh, yeah. I'm still going to be here. Sorry, give me one second. All right. Hi, my name is Anna Velasso. I'm a sophomore at Spelman College and I am speaking on behalf of Isabella Rapaceoli who was a four-cythe resident and she's 15 years old. SB 88 promotes a dangerous misconception that the discussion of LGBTQ plus issues are inappropriate for young people and would pressure school boards to develop policies targeting LGBTQ plus students. The intentionally vacant, confusing language in this bill would have a chilling effect on free speech, distracts, schools, administrators from real issues and interfere with teachers ability to deal with their jobs. Parents and teachers should be able to work together to support each young person as their individual authentic self instead of being hampered by one-size-fits-all policies that mandate how teachers can or can't do their jobs. I firmly believe that Georgia has the potential to be a home to a generation of million of incredibly bright and skilled young people. But what incentive do we give them to stay when we choose to even hear a law of the law that aims to break trust, break communities, break families and break our children's psyches to the point of reducing them to their appearance or gender identity? To those who claim to advocate for the youth for the children here we are now pleading for a classroom that welcomes love and learning rather than hate and discrimination. Before we pass this bill we are allowing for any of the millions of children in the state of Georgia regardless whether they identify as LGBTQ or not to be subject to ostracization, isolation and learning environments that encourage division and reward for youth and educators who turn on each other. These laws that continue to spring up in one way or another only prove to me that hundreds of LGBTQ youth in Georgia once more know that we simply don't belong. During the eyes of legislators supporting this hate I, a 15 year old, am not a human being. Self-expression is an undeniable right to all and we cannot legislate what we falsely demoral and push perceptions of what a child should and should not dress like. Our classrooms and discussions that take place within them must reflect the world around us. By pretending we do not see our differences in choosing to suppress them instead of embracing them we are creating a generational culture that relies on ignorance and delusion as opposed to solidarity, acceptance and collaboration. I can sincerely tell you that no one is forcing us to believe anything. No one is forcing me to believe anything. Dear legislators please just let us feel safe in our classrooms. Let me feel safe. Thank you. Thank you for your comment. Sarah Rivera? Sarah? Back. Sorry, Diana. My name is Rachel Ward. My pronouns are they them. I am a non-binary queer trans person and I work for the United Church of Christ national setting. I am the minister of gender and sexuality justice ministries. But I'm not sure that my credentials matter that much. My personhood should. I want to speak from the caliber of the Christian upbringing of which you want to have in this bill. I do have a master divinity and master of practical theology with honors from Columbia Theological Seminary here in Atlanta. I want to tell you about Genesis. So Adam in the Hebrew language is a DOM. A DOM is a genderless being that comes into formation. I know I'm going to have a lot of faces looking at me. And that really truly what we have in the Hebrew Bible, not the Old Testament because it is the Hebrew Bible, is a simple ask of us. It is to tend to one another and the earth, to tend to one another. This bill would not tend to all. It would not create safety for trans and non-binary youth. It would continue harm in the rhetoric and uptick of violence that happens outside and within classrooms. I also want to note that my parents are both educators retired. I was raised in the bottom of the state where there's like four traffic lights. If I was a kid there right now and this became law, I wouldn't be here anymore. We have a responsibility and a call as a person who struggles with calling myself a Christian and a minister and pastoral role because of the way it's tainted. We have a responsibility to merit one another, the amago day of which we share. The God that is implanted within us when we are created uniquely and wonderfully made. This bill does not do that. And so I am in strong opposition. And I would also like to uplift that the UCC, United Church of Christ, has created several resolutions in the last 25 plus years condemning such rhetoric and such a tense of disembodding the personhood of God's created people, which is all of us friends, all of us. Thank you.\n\nThank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Nilesh. Hello. My name is Nilesh Chargar Warty. I am a Georgia Tech student, studying aerospace engineering. I consider Georgia my second home. I've been here for five years. I love it here, right? But I've also been part of the public school system back in my home state of New Hampshire. And they also tried to pass a very similar bill, such as this one earlier this year. And I spoke about against it then. And I'm just going to speak about it against it now, because I care about the state. And I love the state, being it my second home. So within the public school system, especially in high school, I was a queer student. I was not accepted by my family. It was hard being at home. I tried to spend as much time as I possibly could at school for that reason, because it was the only place that I felt safe. It was the only place that I felt accepted. And that was mainly due to the teachers around me who supported me. And I could talk to freely without feeling any fear or restriction upon my speech or upon their speech. They genuinely cared about me. They genuinely cared about my well-being. And they genuinely wanted to see me do well for myself. They pointed me to resources. They pointed me to counselors. They pointed me to people who could help me go through a time that was quite difficult in my life. And I could have only done that because I was allowed to have that open communication, that freedom of speech that was needed to be able to freely talk to my teachers. So I built this world that type of trust that can be fostered between teachers. It would have ruled that type of connection that students would be able to feel between their teachers. And they ruled a feeling of safety within a place that students should be able to feel safe. Thank you. Crystal Amons. Crystal. Kim Siders. Good morning. My name is Kim Siders. Thank you for this opportunity to talk to you today. My child is transgender. We saw this coming. I mean, we saw these examples of opposite gender expressions for years and the told that it took on my child not understanding or not having any language or relate to anyone else who also had these feelings. Being alone in that experience was very distressing. Being able to have conversations in the classroom with their friends and have a safe space and not be othered and not be shut down was really important for my child's mental health. I think we all know. We want to protect a group of people or any group animals, right? Save the whales. What do you do? You educate people on the right that that group has to live unharmed by others. That's how education can protect transgender children. The witness today, the Senator brought to the last meeting, the last time this bill came up, clearly want to use this bill so that their child doesn't see a trans day of visibility poster. It doesn't mean it's a recruiting event. It just means my child gets to live, out loud, and should be left alone, unharmed. They should be as free with their expression as any other child. And so I understand what the purposes of this bill is because of the witnesses the Senator has brought here and the examples that they have given. They want to erase my child. They don't want to know my child exists. They don't want their child to bump into my child and know there's a transgender kid there. That's really unfair. It's really hurtful. And for a marginalized group of people, if we want to protect them, I think we tell other people that they exist. And that's OK. Nobody's trying to recruit here. So thank you. Thank you. Next up is Taylor Hawkins. And our final speaker is Mike Griffin. We have one more I apologize after Mike. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, distinguished senators. Good to see you all again. Taylor Hawkins from Frontline Policy Council, our organization seeks to protect family and Christian values here in the state level from a biblical worldview. This bill before you seeks to address very important issues. It's critical that in Georgia we have classrooms that are focused on education, not indoctrination, and that children are able to learn and grow free from taxpayer-funded radicalism. However, and we ourselves have further many pieces of legislation on this issue. However, this bill tries to address these issues in a way that I feel is not appropriate. That organization cannot support. The crux is this. This bill while not intending to do so undermines parental rights in our code and accepts the indoctrination it tries to prevent, and inserts the government into private school's abilities to operate free from government coercion. When we deal with an issue like this, we have to be cautious about the methodology we use in approaching it and make sure the state doesn't do the opposite of what's intended. We've worked with multiple national and state partners on these issues for over five years and consultation with them. They've produced the council that I'd like to share with you today. Three brief problems with this bill. One is that it radically rolls back the parental rights we enshrined in this body last year in 2022. Changing the parent's fundamental role as primary and preeminent decision-maker to one subject to what government boards deem appropriate, you'll see that in Section D. It also allows discussion of sensitive and inappropriate topics for schools as long as there is quote unquote parental notification that such discussion took place that is unacceptable. That's subsection C of Section D. And it points children to counselors before their parents, which suggests the government employees have the right to determine what is harmful for your child and choose on that basis to withhold sensitive information about crucial topics from parents. This too is unacceptable. Second, it is foundational to our state's recognition of parental rights that parents directly upbringing and education of their child. This includes very specifically the ability of parents to contract with a private school system of their choice free from government coercion in order to pursue that education. We cannot clumsily shove into our code laws that would insert the government into the relationship between parents and schools thereby infringing on parents' rights. Third, and finally, the language of this bill would codify into code the idea that discussing such topics of queer theory is acceptable as long as there is parental notification and an available opt out that's in subsection two of the definition section. This is absolutely a very crucial issue. Addressing taxpayer-funded radicalism in schools is an important issue. This bill unfortunately does not go about addressing that. We would encourage that we table this bill for further discussion. Thank you all for your consideration. Thank you for your comment. Mike Griffin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is Mike Griffin. I'm the Public Affairs Representative with the Georgia Babies Mission Board. And we're here to support frontline policies, counsel's position on opposing this bill. We are categorically in favor of the bill by way of the subject matter. And we do agree with Senator Cardinett, what he is saying about the importance of parents and their rights and their responsibility to know what's going on. We don't even have to agree on these type of sexual issues to agree on the fact that it is important that parents be notified that they have proper authority in this. So we do understand the need that the senator is seeking to address. But we too agree with frontline policy counsel on the concern about the parent's rights issue. And it seems to be putting a little more authority on the government. We're concerned about the private school be concerns being brought into this as well. The terminology acceptance we're concerned may go too far. And there's an inconsistent patchwork we're concerned to about this. Whereas the parental rights bill covered all the state. This would only be in certain parts. So we're concerned about it. And we'd love to work with the committee and trying to get language that would be better. And hopefully we don't have any, you know, this is my 16th year down here. And there's always sometimes unintended consequences that happen is not what it's meant by the bill. But it can happen. And so we definitely want to work and make sure that we don't go into those issues with it as well. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for your comments. Our last speaker, Kathy Fru. Good morning, or maybe it's afternoon by now. My name's Kathy Fru. I'm a retired school counselor. I was a school counselor in Colorado. I dealt with our work with students who were suicidal because their families did not accept their sexual orientation. So I first end experience with that drama. But what I guess I really want to bring up is this underlying assumption based on these slides that were produced. That children can be indoctrinated to be something they aren't. I know firsthand that many students who are transgender, LBGQ, lesbian, whatever, know that from a very early age. And I challenge that anyone, these curriculums that were being discussed, can truly indoctrinate or change a child's feeling about themselves. In the years past, if you think about it, we have learned what dyslexia means, what it means to be autistic. There are so many different iterations of people that this is just one little piece of who a person is. And we have learned a great deal in the years past, whereas before we might say to a child or to the parents, well, they're just not very smart. Actually, they're quite intelligent. They just had a different way of learning or a different way of expressing themselves. And so I think we're on a trajectory here that we have a long ways to go to learn about how people operate, how they think of themselves. And I think we need to step back and respect everyone. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. With the author, I'd like to have some closing remarks. Mr. Chairman, thank you. Three. Mr. Chairman, thank you again for having to hear and thank the members for coming. Thank the people and the audience participating. Once again, like to reiterate, this is how we get things done. We talk about it. We don't mock each other. We don't think the math thoughts of each other we're here to get things done. And I want to make sure that I want to set the record straight on my issues. I hate no one. I have absolutely no hate in my heart for anyone. And to think that I'm against the trends, people are trained, are the queer theory or whatever, absolutely has nothing to do with this. I am not and that's for the record. I'm not about erasing anyone. I'm not about doing any of that kind of stuff. I simply worked on authoring a bill, which by the way was done before SB 140, it was tabled. SB 140 came later. That this bill was tabled. Working for a solution to involve parents. I understand what Senator Settler's was talking about. I understand when we start going down a road, how we tell any organization what they can and can't do. I understand where you're coming from with that. I truly agree with you on that. My simple bill is, and maybe this has been morphed into something that may be a little bit broader than that I'm reading in here. And everybody has a way of reading whatever they want to read into a bill. I have a problem with that. I understand that. But the reality of the bill was simply this, to get back to this, that involve parents in the discussion and the parents are okay with it. Do what you got to do, do what you want to do. If the parents say they want to opt out and understand this, this is before the age of 16. This is not anything after that. Age of consent and Georgia. That's what I tried to portray as the intent of the bill. If that's not what came across, then I sincerely think that we need to have a little more talk and a little more work on it. And obviously, we can narrow it on down. But the point is, the bill was never intended. And we reiterate, never intended to be against anyone or any person's sexual orientation, whatsoever that person is. And I once again, I appreciate the time of you folks. I appreciate you folks coming out, making time for your day to come out. And I'm here to answer questions. I don't run for these things. I just want parents involvement in what goes on with their children. Simple as that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Any final thoughts or questions from the committee? I see none. Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for coming out today. I know we had a lot of speakers. This meeting went on quite a while. This is a hearing only. No vote will be taken today. Thank you very much. You'll have a good rest of your day. This meeting is adjourned.",
