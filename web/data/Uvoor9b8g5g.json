the nasa zero this bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed clerical read the caption to HR 920 HR 920 HR 920 by Representative Ross in the seventh and others a resolution condemning the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation this resolution having been assigned to the committee on rules that committee recommends that this resolution be adopted the chair recognizes speaker David Ralston to present the resolution thank you madam speaker members of the house I come before you today to present house resolution 920 for a very simple and singular purpose to condemn the invasion of the Ukraine by the Russian Federation and to put Georgia own record as standing up for those who are standing for freedom I'm not naive I realize that our action today will not alter the course of events before us and probably won't even be read in Washington but there are some occasions presented to us by fate where it is important to say what should be obvious and that is to stand with good against evil I cannot begin to fathom what Vladimir Putin is thinking of or why he would commit this kind of atrocity but today we will call him out for the tyrant that he is and condemn his actions and those who willingly follow him he is a bloodthirsty tyrant who deserves condemnation and not words of praise or cheers you'll note you'll note that I emphasize the word willingly follow him many of Russia's own citizens are being brave and standing up to their government's invasion of Ukraine sadly many are being forcibly detained by their own government as a result we acknowledge that this invasion is not the fault of all the Russian people this invasion is the fault of a despotic deranged and despicable circle of Russian leaders who are bringing shame on their own flag and their country we cannot yet know how many injuries and fatalities have been caused by Russia's unprovoked aggression just today today for example it has been reported recently in the news that the Russians have attacked a maternity and children's hospital I'm gonna say that again in case you miss thought you miss heard me the Russians have attacked a maternity and children's hospital I haven't seen them but I'm told the images from that scene from news outlets are too horrific to contemplate much less display here in this house we do know that this invasion has caused an estimated two million Ukrainians to flee their homes for fear of becoming one of those casualties these are civilians innocent men women and children who have done absolutely nothing to warrant this war that has devastated their communities and their country and torn their families apart if you tried watching the nightly news lately and if you react as I do your stomach has been turned upside down by the honing images of children crying walking along with their families if they are lucky to escape Putin's war I want to add here my admiration for the Ukrainian people for standing up and defending their nation even with the odds firmly stacked against them they have shown the kind of resolve that you hope somewhere deep down lies within each of us their bravery and resolve stands as a lot of hope in this world and that spirit I would ask that we continue to do all we can to support them in their cause that's what their resolution calls on both the president and the Congress to continue to take prudent actions to bring about a swift peaceful end to this conflict I hope you'll note that this resolution is signed by the leadership of both political parties in here because this is not a Democrat or a Republican issue on this point politics stops at the water's edge and we unite as Americans our nation has stood up against tyrants before and we do so here again today because today we are all Ukrainians I would ask you to join with me in praying for the people of the Ukraine those in harm's way and praying that this bizarre barbaric chapter of history ends quickly and as peacefully as possible I would ask your favorable consideration of House resolution 920 and I thank you for your attention thank you madam Jerry you're the well gentlemen as yielded the well is there any objection to the previous question being ordered the chair here's none the previous question is ordered is there any objection to agreeing to the report of

was a quarter of the 74th and others to be entitled an act to amend part six of Article six chapter two entitled 20 the fiscal Georgia and Teta relating employment of the quality basic education act so as to remove the needs development rating from the group of performance evaluation ratings which may adversely impact on educators ability this bill I refer to the committee on education that committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute chair recognizes chairman Corbett to present the bill thank you madam speaker members of the House I bring before you House bill 1295 LC 490917 s in Georgia about 50% of the teachers leave the profession in the first five years so the 10 of this bill what we're trying to do is change the evaluation of the to really get a proper evaluation when we get the teachers a help they need so they can become hopefully highly effective teachers and not be penalized by the professional standards commission and losers certificate and that's that's all we're trying to do with this bill I appreciate your favor support there are no well there is a question I you've want the chair recognizes representative Clark for a question to your left thank you madam chair does a gentleman you to the to the lady yes yes so just to clarify what specifically are we removing from the standards we're not moving far as the professional standards commission the needs improvement evaluation a lot of times a school system is hesitant to give a teacher a needs improvement because if they get to within five years they lose their accreditation so the school system still can give them a needs improvement it just removes that from the professional standards commission where they won't lose their accreditation and hopefully we get them the that if they get an easy improvement we can we can get them a professional development plan in place you're bringing them a mentor help teach them to you know I say hopefully get them to a highly effective teacher that's the goal of this bill thank you thank you I yield the well thank you the gentlemen as yielded the well is there an objection to the previous question being ordered the chair here's none

Thank you, Madam Speaker. Members, I present before you today House Bill 1284, your favorable consideration. Some of you who know me know much, know how much I love two things. Administration of local government and tax law and policy. Some of the things that this bill happens to comprise. Specifically, this bill regards how county tax commissioners and counties contract with municipalities to collect municipal taxes, fees, and special assessments. This is important because especially as we seek to create more municipalities, there won't necessarily be efficiencies of scale or even a desire for all of them to collect their own taxes and prepare their own tax digest. Unfortunately, though right now, we have under state law an inconsistent kind of chemical three tiered system on how these contracts are negotiated, depending on the number of tax parcels in a county, whether it's over under 50,000, or as of last year because of development that arose in my county, Quenette, whether the county happens to have 14 or more municipalities. I say inconsistent because depending on what category or tier you're in, either the county, the municipality, or even in some instances, the county tax commissioner can have less power in the decision making on what these contracts look like than what they perhaps should and ultimately have what the county tax commissioners excuse me, can receive for fulfilling these municipal responsibilities. Furthermore, if this is important, there is no actual cap under the law on what commissioners can receive for these responsibilities on top of their annual salary, which has led to some inefficiencies that ultimately harm the local taxpayer most of all, allowing in some cases for additional compensation far beyond the actual cost of these services, or if there were a fair market value for those services, the value of those services. So what this bill does is to address those issues by, above all, finally creating one uniform system that applies in all 159 counties, and that system dictates that the three relevant parties, the county tax commissioner, the county, and the municipality all have a seat at the table and negotiate the contract together, ensuring equal bargaining power, again, regardless of where you are in our great state. Furthermore, in a nod to transparency, the contracts they negotiate will have to specify what is being paid for which services or purposes, including, again, the cost of the actual services provided. Finally, House Bill 1280 does set a cap on the compensation for the tax commissioners that is on top of their annual salary, and that cap is at 50% of the minimum annual salary tax commissioners are required to be paid already under state law. Particularly, we'll close by wanting to thank Chairman Eftration, who I know was committed to revisiting this issue this year to ensure more uniformity, transparency and fairness in contracting, and appropriately enough, given what HB 1280 sets out. We are also grateful to the Georgia Association of Tax Officials, or GATO, which represents the tax commissioner statewide. ACCG and GMA for coming together, surveying their members since, I believe last summer, and figuring out a structure that works for everyone, including, I stress, again, ultimately the local taxpayers. All three of them, GATO ACCG, GMA support this bill, and with that, I ask for your favorable consideration. Madam Speaker, I yield for questions. You do have questions. The chair recognizes representative Bentley in front of you for a question. Mr. Gentlemen, you. I do yield to the strawberry queen. Thank you. I certainly appreciate it. Isn't that true, representative, that this bill passed out of committee with bipartisan support? It did, and it has bipartisan sponsorship. It will help all 159 counties, yes. And is it not further true that I will be supporting your bill on today? I will assume not to be true, and thank you very much, representative. The chair recognizes representative Holcomb. Thank you, Madam Speaker. Mr. Gentlemen, you. I do yield. Is it not true, Representative Lim, that this is your first bill, and I'm very proud of you for your hard work? It is true, and thank you for the pride you have in me, and have had in me for many years, even before this job. So thank you. The chair recognizes representative McLaren for a question. To your right. Thank you, Madam Speaker. Does the representative yield? Yes, to my law school classmate. Representative, you mentioned that you have a very strong interest in both local government administration and tax on policy. I was wondering if you've ever listed those interests on any sort of online dating profile, and if so, how that's worked out for you. I will send Representative McLaren, my former OKCupid profile, at a later time. Who says magic can't happen on the House floor? Thank you, Representative. There are more. I do know that Chairman Abstration intends to speak to this bill, but being that this is my first, I will yield to any specific substantive questions. The chair recognizes representative Washburn for a question. Thank you, Madam Speaker, with a gentleman yield. I do yield. Is it not true that this bill is an excellent bill that will make much more efficient than municipalities' ability to do tax assessment and collection of those taxes? I certainly agree with that, and I'll point out at least two ways that happens. One, again, municipalities will be more likely to contract with county tax commissioners who do have those efficiencies of scale. And second of all, by setting that cap, we're ensuring that again, ultimately the taxpayers aren't paying for services that are not actually being provided for them. So I would agree with you, yes. Will you yield for another question? I will yield for one more question. The chair is not true that I commend you for your hard work on this bill and for producing this excellent legislation and getting it through the legislative process. Thank you, Representative Washburn. The chair recognizes the majority leader for a question. I do yield. Representative, isn't it true that you almost made it to the longstanding tradition of freshmen being seen and not heard their first two years ago. So congratulations, son. And standing your ground, presenting a good bill, we look forward to supporting you. Congratulations. Thank you, leader. There are no more questions. I will yield for one more question. On the record, I answered all the questions. I yield the well-thank you, Madam Speaker. The gentleman is yielded the well. The chair recognizes chairman frustration to speak to the bell. Well, how do you follow that? I want to thank the House for hearing me on this today. This legislation has been contemplated and discussed for over a decade. So compensation of county tax commissioners is something that's been well covered in the media and legislative work to try to address that was taken on by former judiciary chairman from Sandy Springs worked very hard on that issue for many years. And what you have today before you really started in the final two days of the legislative session last year, you may recall legislation was amended to address an issue with Gwinnett County. And there were questions that I received here in the well about how can this be made to apply statewide. We need a statewide uniform system across the state. It's wrong that this is just applying in one or two counties. And what we did is immediately got to work on that legislation. Through the summer, we worked very hard to put together the bill that's now before you as House Bill 1280. And as you heard from Representative Lim, this legislation has support of the Georgia Association of Tax Officials, ACCG and GMA. And I think that that's really a huge accomplishment to have one standard that will apply statewide addressing this well-recognized issue and that everybody is on board with it. And just three things you can maybe mention if asked about this in your community. Number one, it will require a three-way contract between county cities and tax commissioners so that everybody has say in the process. Number two, it's going to apply to the collection of both taxes and fees. That question was out there. What are we going to do about taxes and fees being treated differently? And third, as Representative Sponsor said, there will be a cap on the amount of compensation. There's no current cap in place. So it's really quality legislation in my view that is a result of great bipartisan work. I'm proud to support House Bill 1280 and ask that you do the same. I yield the well. The gentleman has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Here's none. The committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. For what purpose does Representative Clark rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Statue inquiry. Is it not true that when we passed a bill that dealt with tax commissioner compensation and it only dealt with Gnett and Fulton that I express concerns that was only targeting to counties and I am very happy that we have now addressed this statewide. The chair is sure the lady knows of that of which she speaks. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of the bill, the yeas were 161. The nays were zero. The bill having received the requisite constitution majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House bill 1043, 1043. House bill 1043, representative Jasper. So the 11th being titled an act to amend. Chapter 12, the title 50, the fiscal of Georgia and Ontario relating to commissions and other agencies. So as a revive for the creation of the Georgia endowment for teaching professionals. Let's bill them refer to the committee on higher education and committee records.\n\nAs this bill do pass. Chair recognizes Chairman Jasper's to present the bill. Thank you, Madam Speaker. Thank you, members, for hearing about another effort by the Rule Development Council to strengthen Rule Georgia. This bill will create the Georgia Endowment for Teaching Professionals to create a public-private partnership for our technical schools. And we found out through our visits across the state there were positions in our schools that are going to unfilled or unable to even find a teacher to fill them. It's been very difficult. In other words, these teachers can find more higher pay in the private industry. So at a time to help, this bill creates a board of trustees and advisory committee that's charged with raising funds and then distributing them in with NCSG due to need. You'll see lots of how the board works and more, but most important thing that's in here is this board to get started has to raise $100,000. 50 from private, 50 from public, before they can do anything. And if they do not do that, the council will sunset. Let me save any times here. This will give TCSG another tool of toolbox to keep our Georgia's well-trying for the future. Madam Speaker, it's my bill. My would gladly answer any questions or yield the will if they're not any. There are no more questions. Thank you, ma'am. The gentleman is yielded the well. Is there any objection to a previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which is favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machine. All those opposed will vote no. All those opposed will vote no. All those opposed will vote no. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of the bill, the yeas were 157. The nays were four. The bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 849. House Bill 849. House Bill 849 by Representative Smith. And 41st of me, a title of an act to amend Code Section 19. The 7-5 of the fiscal to Georgia and Tata relating a reporting of child abuse. So it's to add human resources, personnel, and supervisory personnel in a workplace that employs minors as mandatory reporters for child abuse. This bill, I'm referring to the committee on industry and labor that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. The chair recognizes Representative Smith to present the bill. Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the House. Today I bring before you HB 849. And what this bill simply does is that it requires any business with five or more employees that hire minors in the workforce to designate their human resource personnel, which means anyone that is responsible for the hiring of employees as a mandated reporter. A mandated reporter is a person who, because of his, or her profession is legally required to report, once again report, not investigate any suspicion of child abuse or neglect to the relevant authorities. These laws are in place to prevent children from being abused and to end any possible abuse or neglect at the earliest possible stage. Now let's address the need for this bill. Child abuse is a critical issue in the United States for nearly five children die every day due to abuse or neglect. Every 10 seconds, a new report of abuse is made. And most of the reports of suspected child abuse or neglect tend to come from the professionals who come into close or consistent contact with minors. Now this bill specifically deals with the interaction and the conversations between adults and teenagers between the ages of 14 and 17, but the impact is intended to save the lives of many more. In the households where teenagers have younger siblings, this teenager could be the only one able to speak up for them. Also, this could be the first time teenagers are introduced to other adults outside the supervision of their parents that aren't their teacher, coach, or pastor. And with that being said, teens are also less likely to report harassment, therefore making the ability to recognize an inappropriate interaction within adult at the job crucial. Now let's talk about who was being affected by this legislation. Once again, that's any business that has five or more employees that hire minors. And the reason for the number of five is not arbitrary. The intent of this is to provide flexibility to the smallest of our businesses while also protecting the majority of our teens and the workforce. In the code section for mandatory reporters, only the individual is responsible for the reporting and not the business. And before I close, mandated reporter trending is offered for free and it is easy to register online. And as a former school teacher, I have seen the mandated reporting requirement work to end abuse and the lives of the students that I have personally talked and I believe the same thing can be done in our workforce here in Georgia. And with that Mr. Speaker, I will yield for any questions and if there aren't any, I will yield the well. There are a couple questions. The chair recognizes representative Graveli for a question. Mr. General Maniel, certainly. It's not true that you and I have had the great privilege and pleasure of coaching youth in our community and where you and I have actually been to the same coaching events and enjoyed working with the young people in our community. And is it not further true that you and I both have been trained on mandatory reporting? And so this is a very important issue, not only in the workplace, but as we as community coaches in our community. The gentleman knows of what he speaks. I appreciate it's a good bill. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Chair recognizes representative Ridley for a question. My friend Yield. My good friend, yes. Is this your first bill? You know what I passed for about four years ago. Well, that guy. Well, this is a great bill. I am disappointed that I can't make no fun of it because you picked something serious to bring up here right now. But I appreciate your bill. Appreciate your friendship and appreciate your foresight on this. Always, always. Thank you. Chair recognizes representative McLeod for a question. Does the gentleman yield? Certainly. So I think it's a very good bill and I love the intent. I just want to ask a question about on casual contact. If it say a child came into McDonald's and I see something and I'm an employee, I see something that I'm concerned. Is could that create some problems with how it's get handled? I'm just concerned about just the casualness of and basically somebody saying they're judging it to be harmful to that child, not knowing what's going on exactly. That's absolutely a great question. And it helps me clear up the intent of this bill. The intent of this bill is the focus on the workforce. But as a mandate of reporter, you are required to report any abuse that you see. It's reporting, not investigating. Okay, thank you. Chair recognizes representative Sains for a question. Does the gentleman yield? Yes. Is it not true that the significance of mandated reporters has been shown through this pandemic as child abuse and neglect reports have gone down because contacts for children as they stay home has also gone down. The gentleman knows what he speaks. Thank you for bringing this time we bill. Thank you. And with that, Madam Speaker, I'll give the way. And there are no more questions. The gentleman has yielded the well. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? Chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee has agreed to show this bill now pass. All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of the bill, the yays were 160. The nays were zero. The bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. The clerk agreed to caption the House Bill 884. House Bill 884, members, and a built in the 112th and others to be entitled to the bill. The bill has been called to the committee to amend chapter 143. The official code of Georgia annotated relating to general provisions of professions and businesses, so to change certain provisions relating to expedited licenses, endorsements for military spouses. This bill will refer to the committee on regulated industries. That committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Belton to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is the last time I'll bring to you a military friendly bill. I thank this body for over the last seven years we've passed over 57. 57 military friendly bills. I do thank you for that. I want to say a moment of thanks to the speaker for House Resolution 920. Throughout my naval career and my father's career in Al Williams and Colonel Josh Bonner and Derek David Clark and Sherry Gilligan and Mike Glanton, Colonel Bill Hitchens, Scott Holcomb, action Jackson, Sandra Scott, Eddie Lumsden, Mark Newton, Randy Nick's, Colonel Prince, Philip Singleton, Ed Sessler, Brad Thomas, the wife of the husband of Gloria Frazier. What we were all trying to do in our military career was to avoid what's happening right now in the Ukraine and it very saddens me what's going on there. House Bill 884 is a direct request by the Secretary of State to modify our code. I'd like to remind you that Georgia is the fifth largest military population in America bringing in $28 billion a year. The Secretary of Defense is the largest single employer in Georgia, 120,000 military service members and over a third of a total, third of a million total jobs in Georgia. What this bill does is actually it perfects something that Representative Al Williams did a long time ago for spouse licensures. Whenever I go to these military bases even today, the number one thing these base commanders talked to me about is spouse licensures. It's not happening quick enough. So what this says is that once the spouse is put together all of his paperwork and he has the qualifications and the training and the expertise and the examinations, the board will move in 30 days. Now why do I say 30 days? If you looked up there, I'm very top in the yellow. The Secretary of Defense is requesting that we move on these in 30 days. Who is the Secretary of Defense? He's Lloyd Austin from Thomasville, Georgia and he again is the largest employer in Georgia. So 28 states do this right now. If you get the map, please put the map up. If you would, 28 states do this. We're in yellow right now. I'd like to move it to the green again. And on this particular issue, this is where we are in Georgia, on this particular issue. And I stand for questions. You have no questions. I yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of House Bill 884 will vote aye. There's a pose to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 884. The eyes are 164. The nays are zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. We'll conclude the caption to House Bill 1279. House Bill 1279, or as I've gambled with the 15th and others to be entitled to amend Article 3 of Chapter 13 and Title 16, the Fish and Go to Georgia, annotated relating to dangerous drugs. So it's to authorize certain persons with chronic disease and certain persons over 65 years of age to carry prescription medications in a compartmentalized medication container. This bill having a first committee on health and human services that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative Gamble to present the bill. Well thank you Mr. Speaker. House Bill 1279 makes a simple change in law that will help our senior citizens by allowing anyone over the age of 65 to carry up to a 21 day amount of prescription medication in a prescription container currently that is not allowed under law. And if you pass this bill today it will allow our senior citizens to carry their medications. And so I would ask for your favorable consideration. I'm happy to entertain any questions that you may have. Do you yield for questions? I will yield for a question. Chair recognizes representative Jasmine Clark to your left for a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? I yield. So I am looking at the line 20 of the bill. It says persons with chronic disease or over 65. And so my question is law enforcement able to ask for medical diagnosis when they are speaking to someone? Well you know that's a good question. And I would just tell you that if you support allowing individuals who are over the age of 65 to be able to carry their prescription drugs in a prescription container then this is a bill that you're going to want to support today. Does the gentleman further yield? I'll yield for one more but I know we're ready to get out of here. It's been a long day. Yes I'm ready as well. So if law enforcement can't ask for medical diagnosis, does this essentially open it up to where any individual may use these compartmentalized containers to carry their controlled substances or dangerous drugs? No that is not the intent of the law and you know work with the Georgia Pharmacy Association on this to make sure that provision was covered. And I think that we will be able to see that that doesn't happen if we pass this bill today. So with that Mr. Speaker I will ask for this body's favorable consideration and I yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is done. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is done. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable? To the passage of the bill. The chair here is done. The report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no in the clerical, unlock the machines. What purpose does representative Ridley rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not true that all the left out that this bill was going to be called the representative Dodden Hogan bill initially? It's not true sir. I don't know. We need to name a bill after him before he leaves. That's what we do. This might be as good as any. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 1279. The eyes are 164, the nasors zero. This bill, having received the requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Foreed the caption to House Bill 1357. House Bill 1357, I've represent Smith, the 18th to be entitled an act to amend Code Section 202984 relating to the professional standards, commissions authority to create and implement standards and procedures for certifying educational personnel. This bill I'm referring to the committee on education. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. It recognizes representative Tyler Paul Smith to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, this I guess body I bring to you today House Bill 1357. This bill is just a simple change. It simply requires the professional standards commission to consider any teacher certification program outside of the state which meets the accreditation and certification requirements of the professional standards commission. In our state, which then assured state widening a lot of our rural areas, especially in our specialty subjects like STEM. The statistics would show you that roughly a third leave the profession in their first five years. This bill complements what this general assembly and the governor have done in making Georgia a teacher friendly state that provided a $5,000 teacher pay increase. And this helps us to make sure that we have teachers in the pipeline ready to go. And with that, Mr. Speaker, I'll yield for a question. You have no questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I ask this body's favorable consideration. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered to air here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute that chair here's none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill. The chair here's none. The report of the committee has agreed to shall this bill now pass. All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose is representative Wade rise pursuant to rule 133 may I be excused for the vote. General has that right and the general will so reflect. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? So the clerk will unlock the machines on the passage of House Bill 1357. The eyes are 161 the nasors zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. House Bill 1351 has been postponed from previous rules calendars. It is being called today. We have agreed to the caption to House Bill 1351. House Bill 1351, I have a knight of the 130th and others to be entitled to amend Article 7 chapter 4, Title 49. The official quoted Georgia annotated related medical system, Medicaid assistance generally. So it was required for pharmacy benefit management for the Medicaid program to be conducted by the Department of Community Health after a date certain. This bill I refer to the special committee on quality health care. That committee recommends this bill do pass. Chair recognizes chairman Knight to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I don't know if anticipation makes everything sweeter. It just makes you a little more anxious. But at long last, HB 1351, many of you know that this body has been working. And you know, I would like to say that this bill is not only the state of this nation and some of the most landmark legislation in our fight to lower prescription drug benefits, drug cost. And this bill is about carving out the pharmacy benefits from the managed care Medicaid organizations in Georgia. So real quick, let's talk what is one of our Medicaid managed care organizations. We've got three of them, Peach State, owned by Centene number 24 on the Fortune 500. Centene was also recently purchased well care. Their PBM benefit manager is CVS number four on the Fortune 500. Our other Medicaid managed care program is Amerigroup owned by Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield number 23 on the Fortune 500. They have their own affiliated benefit manager and Jenny R. X. And they also contract with CVS. Care source while not a publicly traded company, but is one of the largest Medicaid managed care plans in the country. And there are pharmacy benefit managers expressed groups, which is owned by SIGNA number 13 on the Fortune 500 company. We all know that we've been a long fight against these unscrupulous business practices from these companies. So what have we seen as far as the behavior? Spread pricing. So we charged the taxpayers more for the drugs and the pharmacies are actually reimbursed. I will remind this body, thanks to Chairman England and others that Georgia was one of the first of three states in the nation to uncover spread pricing. In fact, we're in a current lawsuit. Centene is in a current lawsuit which they've set over a $1 billion to settle with a lot of the South Eastern states, including Georgia, which is still in that process of investigation. We've seen steering in which patients are steered to the pharmacies that are affiliated or owned by the PBMs. They're steering some of the most chronically ill patients, cancer, HIV, other patients, autoimmune deficiencies, and they're steering them to their downstream assets, their pharmacies, their mental or pharmacies or specialty pharmacies. And more so, retroactive fees. And one of these PBMs go back into the pharmacies after the adjudication process, days, weeks, sometimes months, and say, we paid you too much. And we're going to take a little bit back. In fact, I'll give you an example shortly. And we've also seen that the PBMs and the managed-gir affiliate pharmacies are being reimbursed more than the independence. And again, we have led. So where's Managed Cade managed care today? Spread pricing we have prohibited in 2019 and 2020. 2020, we prohibited retroactive fees. Again, shearing up the steering legislation, anti-steering legislation. And we've also made sure in prior years under the Mac pricing laws that we tried to make sure our pharmacies were not, did not have underwater reimbursements. Despite all of these efforts of this body, this legislature, this governor, the games persist. In testimony, we had community pharmacies. And a lot of these were from our most rural areas. And they came in and gave examples of what is happening under these Managed Medicaid plans. We had one independent pharmacy that had 3500 prescriptions, negatively reimbursed in the past six months, loss of $21,000. We had another pharmacist that came in and had 3700 prescriptions negatively reimbursed in the past six months, loss of $27,000. Sorry about that. We had another independent pharmacist had 168 prescriptions negatively reimbursed for the past six months, $3,100. Another one, 10,500 prescriptions negatively reimbursed in the last six months for a loss of $68,000. And again, we're sitting here trying to build access to health care. But yet, the very professionals that our Georgia Medicaid patients want to go to, they are actually being driven out. We see steering. We had examples of where some of our most chronicly ill patients were rejected. Said you got to go to what are the specially pharmaceuticals for the PBM. We also began to see in a mayor group on their website, their specially pharmacy. They had two. We've all heard of what's going on with the narrow networks in Georgia and they're killing our hospitals, but especially our rural hospitals in GenieRX and guess what, one other pharmacy, 12 stone health partners in Tennessee. Wasn't it amazing that our cancer patient that testified before the committee said she was told that she could either drive up to Tennessee and get the medicine or she had to get it from the specially pharmacy. But listen to this. Again, her oncologist had it on the shelf. And that...\n\nColleges could have prescribed that medicine and reached around and got that medicine and given it to that cancer patient But the games persist They consist And you know spread pricing was bad enough, but the games that they will play continue and so now we're finding and manage Medicaid We're finding listen to this retroactive fees That we outlawed are made against law in 2020 We had examples you know what it looks like so if you're a pharmacist and All of a sudden a week two month later you had a you had a drug That they went back and grabbed two hundred and nineteen dollars weeks after it was adjudicated at the point of sale On top of that you lost fifteen dollars at the point of sale They took two hundred twenty five dollars out of his pocket a Loss for serving our Medicaid patients We've got others examples that were given Again the bad practices continue so if you remember in 2020 this body overwhelmed when we passed our bill One of the bills which we wanted to have exactly this a carve out That bill also had language for a study it passed the house we got over to the Senate and DCH call me and said we're gonna do the study and I withdrew the bill Well now we have the results of the study a carve out Under the best case scenario and this is an actual year old study By DCH the best case scenario was a savings to Georgia of 1.2 million dollars worst case $7 million loss best case $14 million savings So all of what we heard two years ago about this was gonna cost the state 70 80 90 120 million dollars a year Didn't turn out again DCH's own Actuarial study Proved it so here's where we are today with this bill Based on this study I'm gonna ask you to go back and and again continue through what we're doing Let's carve out the pharmacy benefits out of managed Medicaid Let's let our Medicaid patients go and choose the pharmacy of their choice It's gonna cost us less but most of all it is going to give us transparency Transparency we're gonna know exactly what the cost is Second of all we're gonna have better health care outcomes and when patients get to choose and they get access to more pharmacist and more health care providers Health outcomes increase So again, I want to ask for your favorable support. Let's continue to lead not only in Georgia But lead the nation of what we're doing to make sure that we are lowering the cost of prescription drug benefits Taking the middleman out of the picture mr. Speaker without our yield for any questions You have a question if you care to yield yes, sir chair recognizes representative Gilligan to for a question Thank you mr. Speaker does the gentleman yield I will to my friend Thank you. Thank you for yielding and so my question is would you say that this is good government accountability and Transparency and therefore reducing the cost to the consumer I do and let me tell you is it stands right now Georgia contracts with these Managed care organizations to provide the health care services in this case pharmacy benefits, okay? The you know their pharmacy benefit managers these pbms add on an additional layer of bureaucracy While locking the Medicaid recipients, okay into You know Locking them in the patients then have no choice that there's an extra layer of bureaucracy We're removing that and when we we remove that and we allow more access more competition out there with health care providers adding more into the process That my friend is competition that is transparency and most of all That's going to lead to better health care. Thank you for your question. Thank you for bringing the bill With speaker any other questions you have no further questions Thank you, and I again, I appreciate this body and what y'all done over the years is we take a true hard policy look at these issues at effect Every Georgian and is in this state. Thank you Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered the chair here's none the previous question is ordered Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill the chair Here's none the report of the committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill Will vote aye all those opposed to vote no in the clerical unlocked the machines What purpose does chairman parish rise misspeak on rule 133 I'd like to be excused No one has that right and the journal will so reflect Have all members voted Have all members voted If so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of house bill 1351 The eyes are 162 the nasa zero this bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is there for passed House will come to order chair recognizes the chairman Of the House appropriations committee for emotion Thank you mr. Speaker I move that the house agree to the Senate substitute to house bill 910 as amended by the house Chairman England has moved that the house agree to the Senate substitute to house bill 910 as amended by this house the clerk will read the caption House bill 910 by motion of Ross and seventh Jones the 47th burns the 159th and others To be entitled an act to amend the act making and providing appropriations for the state fiscal year Beginning July 1st 2021 and ending June 30th 2022 known as the General Appropriations Act chair recognizes chairman England to explain the Senate substitute and the House amendment Thank you miss speaker You've got on your desks Just they went out a little while ago The Senate version of house bill 910 or the Senate substitute which is the green fronted piece Then you have also a separate packet that is the house amendment and Just as we have done in the past on several amended budgets We're handling this as an amendment by the house that is agreed upon by the Senate To wrap up our work here so we can Make the final stages of our work on the FY 23 budget, which will start in the morning also you'll note On the house budget research office letterhead a packet that kind of explains Sort of all the pieces that are in it some of the changes are the changes But also many of the underlying things as the bill looked like when it first left here so As always we have a special group that we need to think Think and that's house budget research office and Martha and Christina sitting here on the front row and All the others are either scattered around here in the building or back across the road They have put in innumerable hours Over the last two or three weeks on this budget and trying to get the 23 budget done as well so if you see them please tell them thank you many times many Times they are still here until the wee hours In the day in the evenings trying to get things put together get things proof get things checked and last night It was no exception I also want to thank our colleagues in the Senate and especially chairment Hillary For working with us to get this across the finish line as well as the governor and the Governor's Office of Planning and Budget Director Kelly far and their work on pulling all of the pieces together You know working together we had an infinitely more in common Then you could imagine to make this amendment possible collectively the subcommittee chairs did an amazing job of addressing the pivotal needs of This amended fiscal year in the original bill and the Senate worked with us to capitalize on those house changes and Offered some additional insight and thoughtful programming dollars Initially the amended budget provided for a 1.4% growth and tax revenue over 2021 But with steady gains in the first three quarters of FY 22 the governor felt comfortable and We agree in this amended budget to increase the revenue estimate by an additional $443 million to bring the state's 22 spending to 30.3 billion The primary purpose of the revenue adjustment is to provide an early pavement of $374.8 million to the state's General obligating sinking fund our abound payments Where we pay the principal and interest on our bonds? The revenue estimate change also included an additional three million dollars to the Georgia Technology Authority to implement immediate Responses to growing cyber security concerns as well as 45 million to increase the initial one-time $1,000 salary supplement for our nurses school nurses bus driver school cafeteria workers and the custodial workers That we'd included in the house version of the budget, but to bring that $1,000 now up to $2,000 The other salary increases we agreed upon a few weeks ago or intact and remain the largest statement in this general budget In an addition to those the one-time payment for state employees the $2,000 increase for teachers and the cost of living adjustment for all benefit eligible employees of the three branches of government Beginning on April the first the house amendment reflects the compromise position to take immediate action to stem turnover rates among our employees especially within the correctional facilities at times that reach over a 90% turnover rate with an additional $2,000 increase on top of the $5,000 Cola that everyone else is getting the complete salary package of this amendment and The underlying bill totals $950 million at the end of the day that 950 million is flowing back through the economy of our state by supporting our tax paying hardworking state employees teachers and school personnel The length and probably 95% of the items on this amendment are directly tied to the language change on the salary provision the house made for employees funded by grant speeds finds and Other fund sources the language was tweaked but 76.2 million we spread across multiple agencies is still in place aside from the language changes There are agreements with some great ideas that came from the other chamber One Senate change we embrace includes a one-time 17.5 million dollar program for rural downtown redevelopment grants as we And see investments coming down from the state level for economic development such as Rebian for an example This new funding is designated to help smaller communities to make improvements to stimulate economic growth as envisioned From the local level There's a compromised position of $3 million for equipment operating grants for nursing programs among our higher education Institutions with a wait list and this will help accelerate and build that capacity to get more students in the classroom and more nurses Then within our hospitals nursing homes and assisted living centers Building on the house position in conference we made slight adjustments to increase the facility security improvements for the GBI headquarters Enter replace and improve their lab equipment for a total infusion of $5.3 million The amendment also recognizes even more funding to shore up the Georgia crime victims emergency front fund from the 6.5 million appropriated in the house version to 8.1 million as noted and line 30.5.4 in your amendment The Senate increased and we agreed to double the amount of one-time funds for state parks and recreations Recreation facilities now just about 90 million or excuse me 30 million As you know our state parks saw a huge massive increase in business during COVID-19 And they continue to see that influx of people enjoying our state parks Georgians flocked to the outdoors and Discovered rediscovered are simply kept up their attendance at our sites across the entire state With that volume of usage comes increased need to repair maintain and upgrade the structures and parks themselves From cabins to park into restrooms 80A rounds welcome centers lodges boat docks picnic pavilion The list goes on the most notable adjustment and higher education began in regions Where there is one new capital project for the STEM building can a soft state university for 4.6 million and just over 2 million to establish a cutting edge Integrative precision agriculture research and demonstration farm that will be co located with the fairgrounds down at Perry There's funding for for the construction industry certification programs as well in TCSG and in DOE just under 4 million combined These funds provide heavy and specialized equipment training programs and skill trades which help address some of our labor market shortages The House of Mimit also reflects an infusion of 18 and a half million dollars in Appropriation to airport aid which draws down a 90 federal and a 10% local state match to be used statewide all of our small local towns our small hometowns You all understand and they all understand what a what a needed piece for economic development in these communities these airports are Finally the Mimit segregates 83 million in addition to 23.4 million and existing existing DOT reserves to be used for the state matching requirement Outlined in the federal infrastructure and jobs act as soon as those funds are available as A new program in this budget the funds sent a clear signal to the federal government and the bond rating agencies that Georgia is ready to invest in our state infrastructure Before I close I'd like to remind you that in the FY22 amended budget As it was amended there is 950 million dollars there to fully fund the QBE teaching formula These are the highlights of the changes since the bill left the house you have a robust summary of those highlights that I mentioned earlier in
