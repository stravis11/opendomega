Our chapel in this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 79th House District Representative Mike Wolensky. Representative Wolensky. Thank you speaker members of the House. Today I introduce Rabbi Joshua Heller. Rabbi Joshua Heller's in his 18th year as Senior Rabbi of Congregation of the Benetor and Sandy Springs. Under his 10 year Benetor has grown to be the third largest Jewish congregation in the whole state of Georgia. Rabbi Heller's congregants enjoy his caring, powerful, emotional sermons and he has an amazing sense of humor which always makes it very enjoyable. Rabbi Heller is a former president of the Atlanta Rebynical Association and is a member of the International Committee on Jewish Law and Standards. Rabbi Heller graduated from Harvard with a degree in computer science and passed on job offers from Silicon Valley to become a ninth generation rabbi. During the period after 9-11 he also served as the rabbi of the downtown synagogue in New York. One of the synagogues that's closest to the side of the World Trade Center. He and his wife Wendy are proud parents to three children to which born here in Georgia. I'm grateful and honored to call Rabbi Heller not only my Rabbi but a friend who I can always call for advice or help. Speaker Ralston, Honorable members of the house. I want to offer my profound gratitude for the opportunity to be with you today and in particular to thank Representative Wollensky for that gracious introduction. In our Jewish tradition as we read the book of Exodus we see it as our story and we read how the Israelites had been liberated from slavery in Egypt and they have witnessed ten horrific plagues and now they are free and heading towards the promised land not realizing that Pharaoh is close on their heels. They find themselves caught if you will between the devil and the deep red sea. There's a miracle the sea parts and the Israelites cross through joining together in a song of freedom. This is a story that I and members of my Jewish community hold dear and I hope that many of you do as well. I know what it means to have the pharaohs of many generations motivated by implacable hate stalking me through barren places and indeed one only needs to read the news of what happened in Texas just ten days ago to understand that that is not just an ancient story and I know that many of us here in Georgia understand the evil that was slavery and what it means for some of our brothers and sisters to be on a continued journey towards freedom and I would hope that all of us here understand what it means to be pilgrims on a journey to a better to a promised land and unfortunately all of us as Georgians understand what it means to live through a time of plagues and this is no plague of the first born the angel of death has not stopped with the old but sees as young as well and I pray that you join me in prayer and support for our medical professionals our first responders our educators and all the people whose simple honest work makes it possible for us to live our lives even as they are in harm's way because even as we see the light of dawn some of them have yet not yet emerged into light standing here today all Georgians know what it means to be caught between the pharaohs of our past forces that seek to take away cherished rights and freedoms and a deep sea ahead over which there seems to be no bridge in this moment of darkness turning to dawn of a sea about to part I would like to offer a word of hope to you our Jewish tradition a legend teaches us that as the Jews stood at the sea calling to God praying to God for help the prayers the supplications of Aaron the priest accomplished nothing the staff of Moses man of God had no effect created no path 12 tribes each sought their own route through raging waters it was only when one man not shown benamina dav stepped into the water not just up to his ankles not just to get his knees a little damp not just up to his chest or his neck not until the waters reached his nose his very soul no shown had the courage to dive in and the waters made a dry path for the Israelites to pass through what courage we must have my friends what courage must we have to leave behind pharaohs of our past what courage must we have must you have to have come here to have volunteered to service you leave homes and jobs and families and communities to serve the better the betterment of our state what courage we must have to leave behind the pharaohs of our past we must dive into deep swirling waters we must earn the right to celebrate on the other side when the Israelites finished crossing the sea they sang a song and it was a nation that sang a song not a song of unity but a song of harmony of call and response there is a great song of celebration that we have yet to sing but only if we cross and sing together let us pray members of the legislature I offer thanks for the service that each of you provide I pray that God grant wisdom to each of you I will not pray that you agree on all matters for that would surely be a false prayer but I do pray that you each come to see your work as holy you are guided by your faith your principles your integrity to bring a listening ear a caring heart a discerning soul and a mouth that speaks only truth I pray that you are able to seek the good of every resident of this state whether you see them as the least or the greatest and I pray that you are leaders are like our biblical hero not shown I do not ask that you walk on water but I ask that you lead us through it by example and make sure that each of us that every resident of our state every citizen every dweller is guided on a path to freedom and the promised land that God has promised each of us and let us say amen I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God indivisible liberty and justice for all doorkeepers will unlock the doors Chair recognizes chairman Hogan the chair of the committee on information and audits thank you mr.

Hey, colleagues, it's way past time for Georgia to take a fresh look at how we educate our children. Even when public schools do an excellent job, there's always going to be a small percentage of students who do not perform well in a traditional classroom setting. This means we must focus on funding students, not systems, because one size does not fit all, especially when it comes to education. Should a family, should a low-income family be stuck in a chronically underperforming school? Should a student who's being bullied be forced to stay in a school where they can't learn? The answer is no. Yesterday, I introduced House Bill 999. This is school choice for all. School choice for all. Georgians want school choice. All the polling shows it. In fact, 77% of parents who send their kids to public school favor school choice. This is a bipartisan bill. It's sponsored by three Republicans and three Democrats so far. So I urge you to support school choice in Georgia this year. Thank you. The director recognizes Representative Setsler and the co-delegation for a morning order. Ladies and gentlemen, the House, I'd like to ask you to rise if you would please. We lost a friend of Cobb County yesterday. Colonel Michael H. Boyce, U.S. Marine Corps retired. The four-year chairman of Cobb County Board Commissioners passed away yesterday. He had served as the chair of Cobb County from 2000, being elected in 2016, served for four years and left office in early 2021. Chairman Boyce was born in California, 1949, graduated the University of Notre Dame in 1971, where on the tail end of the Vietnam War, he was commissioned as the second lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps. He served our country for 30 years, left active duty in 2001, and again, as a citizen, ran for office and was elected county chair in 2016. His wife, Judy, three kids, five grandkids, carry on Mike's heart in his tradition. He passed away yesterday after having suffered a first of many strokes about a week ago, was actually up in South Bend, Indiana, had been in a residential fellowship at the University of the University of the Leadership Mentor, in a graduate program there with his wife. It had a year there. It was really half of the time of his life mentoring young people. One of the ones to say about Chairman Boyce briefly is just the joyful spirit that he represented. As many of our military members are, they are able to be joyful even in hard times. I think those that know him recognize that in the face of the harshest criticism, he was always just such a friendly gentleman. Mike was a person in representing Cobb County that served people, looked after and cared people, cared for people, even they would never vote for him that didn't share his political philosophy, but just that kind of gentleman. That servant's heart just came through. Last thing I know Madam Chair, we were running it at a time. I will tell you though, just to give you a picture of the man, when he was running for office in 2016, he had had a mission trip scheduled to Romania. He was going to go for two weeks. He got through the primary, was in a primary runoff and that's six, eight week period between his primary and his primary runoff. We had a two week mission trip scheduled. He did the mission trip. He did cancel the mission trip because he had a political contest ahead of him. He focused on what was important in life. And I just want to celebrate him today and as we think about this young man that served, he was 72 years young, left us too soon, but we're proud of the time we had with him. We'd like to thank him and his family for the life he lived and I'd like to recognize us all recognizing the moment of silence. Thank you. Chair recognizes Representative Chocas for Morning Order. Thank you Madam Speaker. Good morning everyone. On your desk we've placed a book by Barry McCarthy. This is the book. It's titled Small Business Revolution. How Honors and Entrepreneurs can succeed. Mr McCarthy is the CEO of Deluxe Corporation. You know the Deluxe Corporation because it actually prints the checks that they use in our checking accounts. Most of you don't know that approximately 70% of their business deals with payment processing that Georgia accounts for over 80% of the payment processing business in the United States. Deluxe recently opened a facility in Georgia and created over 700 jobs. Mr McCarthy's book is listed as the number two best seller on the Wall Street Journal list of books. His company supports over four million small businesses annually. Mr McCarthy was a presenter at yesterday's Small Business Development Committee meeting. And thank you. Chair recognizes Representative Scofield for Morning Order. Good morning Madam Chair and colleagues. Today is Mental Health Day at the Capitol. Most of 40,000 children and over 30,000 adults are impacted by or living with some form of mental health disorder. They are our family members, constituents, colleagues and some of us in this chamber are battling mental health issues. When one suffers we all suffer. Mental health affects every aspect of our lives. If you need help, dial 988. Although mental health has always been a pressing issue in certain communities, I am very glad to know that this body has decided to make mental health a priority, getting people in organizations the health that they need. To the mental health advocates, thank you for being here today. Chair recognizes Representative Kennerd for Morning Order. As mentioned, it is mental health day at the Capitol and it takes on more meaning this year because we are having such momentum towards a meaningful legislation this year. I want to thank the speaker and Chairman Oliver and Chairman Jones for working across the aisle to do something for Georgia in this regard. Because of mental health day, it's also criminal justice reform day because the largest mental health service provider in our state is our Georgia state prisons and county jails. We have effectively criminalized mental health but when we supported on the front end, we decriminalized it on the back end. Because of mental health day, it's also substance abuse disorder day. These two things are almost connected always addiction and substance abuse and mental health. The overwhelming reason why people abuse drugs and alcohol is because there's an underlying mental health diagnosis that's going untreated. So there's all kinds of wins going on today because it's mental health day and I just thank you for being a part of that. Thank you, Madam Chair. My name is Linda. My name is Linda Suasai. Number of my people. That's awesome. Chair recognizes Representative Nex for Morning Order. Thank you, Madam Chair. Freshman legislators, please listen up. We're going to have a mandatory ethics training meeting this afternoon at, I mean, tomorrow afternoon, tomorrow afternoon at 1 o'clock, room 216 in the Capitol. If you were elected in 2020 or sometime later, you need to come to this meeting. We will have members of the Georgia government, transparency and campaign finance commission there to both give you a briefing and answer questions. We'll have members of legislative council there to brief you and answer questions. So it's very important if you're a freshman legislator that you attend again. It's tomorrow, January the 27th at 1 o'clock in room 216 in the Capitol. Thank you, Madam Chair. Chair recognizes Representative Smith for Morning Order. Thank you, Madam Speaker. What all members of the third congressional district please stand, third congressional district? You've suffered a great loss. I want to tell you, life is fragile right now. February of last year, Russ Carriker was sworn in as DOT board member for District 3. He passed yesterday. The day he was sworn in, the very next day, he was diagnosed with stomach cancer. Everybody smart made a comment one time and I would really like it. He says either elite or you're not. Russ was a lead. He played it all over football, linebacker played there at the same time as Bo Jackson did. But if you knew Russ, you knew that his whole life was revolving around his faith in God, his family, this country and everything that he could do to make this community better. He was one of these young men that he was only 57. He was one of these young men that some of us older ones were helping to give the mantle too to take care of the leadership in Columbus. He was one that could probably be elected mayor or just about anything he wanted to do. So his wife, Patty and his daughter, Avery, please keep them in your prayers and just skip a moment of silence for Russ. Thank you. Thank you. Chair recognizes Chairman Cooper for a morning order. Thank you Madam Speaker. On your desk you have a flyer and I would like to make you aware of the Georgia radio reading service. I hope that not only will you become aware of this service but you will put it out for your constituent. We know of over 200,000 Georgians who have trouble seeing if they can see it all. We are an aging state and as you age more and more people lose their ability to see. And these services help keep a sightless person in contact with their community by having their local paper read to them or being able to have magazines or books also read. Please take it and make this service available to your constituents. Thank you very much. Thank you Madam Speaker. That concludes morning orders.
