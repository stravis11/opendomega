  "transcript": ">> THIS IS A BILL THAT MAKES\nREASONABLE REVISIONS TO OUR\nCIVIL PRACTICE ACT AND\nREASONABLE AS WELL AS\nREASONABLE REVISIONS TO BUILD\nTHIRD PARTY NEGLIGENT SECURITY\nLIABILITY. AND, MR. SPEAKER,\nTHAT'S THE BILL.\n>> PLEASE DON'T GO A DOPE. IT\nAIN'T ABOUT PREMIUMS. DON'T BE\nTHERE, FOLK. LOOK AT IT. THE\nONLY INSURANCE MOST PEOPLE WHO\nARE HARD WORKING GEORGIANS HAVE\nIS A HOMEOWNER'S POLICY. A CAR\nPOLICY, AND HEALTH POLICY.\nTHAT'S IT. THIS IS NOT FOR HARD\nWORKING GEORGIANS. THIS IS FOR\nGOOD LIVING GEORGIANS WHO WANT\nTO LIVE BETTER.\nHOUSE. THE TORT REFORM\nIS FIERCELY DEBATED BY. BY A\nSLIM MARGIN. IT'S THE CLOSEST\nVOTE IN THE HOUSE THIS.\nMORE ON TORT REFORM. COMING UP.\nGEORGIA IS A PRIME DESTINATION\nFOR CONVENTIONS. IT HAS A BUSY\nINTERSTATE SYSTEM FOR\nTRANSPORTING GOODS BY TRUCKS,\nAND IT'S HOME TO THE WORLD'S\nBUSIEST AIRPORT. BUT THESE SAME\nHIGHLIGHTS CONTRIBUTE TO MAKING\nGEORGIA A HOTSPOT FOR HUMAN\nTRAFFICKING. TONIGHT, I SIT DOWN\nWITH GEORGIA'S FIRST LADY,\nMARTY KEMP, TO TALK ABOUT HER\nANTI-TRAFFICKING FIGHT AND THE\nRESULTS. SHE CONTINUES TO\nPRODUCE. IT'S A BIPARTISAN\nBATTLE, AND TWO LAWMAKERS JOIN\nTHE SHOW WHO SHARE HER PASSION\nFOR MEANINGFUL CHANGE. FIRST\nCORRESPONDENT SARAH KALLIS HAS\nTODAY'S CAPITOL REPORT.\n>> HI, DONNA. TODAY WAS BUCKY'S\nDAY AT THE CAPITOL, AND THE\nHOUSE DEBATED TORT REFORM. THE\nDAY STARTED WITH A FINAL PUSH\nAGAINST SB 68. THE ROBUST\nLAWSUIT REFORM BILL THAT WOULD\nLIMIT GEORGIA'S ABILITY TO SUE\nBUSINESSES FOR CRIMES THAT OCCUR\nON THEIR PROPERTY, STOPS\nATTORNEYS FROM RECOVERING FEES\nTWICE FOR THE SAME CASE, AND\nALLOWS SEPARATE TRIALS FOR\nASSIGNING RESPONSIBILITIES AND\nDAMAGES.\n>> RIGHT NOW, GEORGIA LAW\nPROTECTS INNOCENT VICTIMS LIKE\nME. VICTIMS WHO HAVE A\nCONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO A JURY\nTRIAL. RIGHT NOW, GEORGIA LAW\nHOLDS OWNERS AND MANAGERS OF\nPROPERTIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE\nCRIMES THAT THEY TURNED A BLIND\nEYE TO. THIS GIVES THESE\nAPARTMENTS MOTIVATION TO KEEP\nTHE APARTMENTS SAFE. SB 68 WAS\nWRITTEN BY INSURANCE LOBBYISTS\nAND STRIP VICTIMS LIKE ME OF\nTHEIR RIGHTS.\n>> THE HOUSE THEN TOOK UP THE\nBILL, ONE OF THE MOST DEBATED\nPIECES OF LEGISLATION THIS\nSESSION. THE TORT REFORM BILL\nWAS NAMED AS GOVERNOR KEMP TOP\nLEGISLATIVE PRIORITY.\n>> THIS IS A BILL THAT MAKES\nREASONABLE REVISIONS TO OUR\nCIVIL PRACTICE ACT AND\nREASONABLE REVISIONS TO OUR\nEVIDENTIARY CODE, AS WELL AS\nREASONABLE REVISIONS TO OUR\nLIABILITY, THIRD PARTY\nNEGLIGENCE, SECURITY, LIABILITY.\nAND, MR. SPEAKER, THAT'S THE\nBILL.\n>> OPPONENTS OF THE BILL WERE\nQUICK TO SAY IT DOES NOT\nGUARANTEE LOWER INSURANCE RATES.\n>> THE PROPONENTS OF THIS BILL\nHAVE SPENT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS\nPREYING ON OUR STRESS AND\nFRUSTRATION, TELLING US THAT\nTHIS BILL WILL REDUCE OUR RATES,\nSTABILIZE OUR RATES, KEEP\nPROVIDERS FROM LEAVING THE\nSTATE. IT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE.\n>> BUT SUPPORTERS SAY IT STRIKES\nA BALANCE BETWEEN INSURANCE\nCOMPANIES AND CITIZENS.\n>> THIS PROTECTS BUSINESSES FROM\nUNJUST LAWSUITS WHILE\nMAINTAINING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR\nGENUINE NEGLIGENCE.\n>> MOST DEMOCRATS SAID IT ONLY\nMAKES IT HARDER FOR VICTIMS TO\nRECEIVE JUSTICE.\n>> THIS BILL HURTS THE\n92-YEAR-OLD ELDERLY WOMAN WHO\nDIED IN HER BED BECAUSE SHE WAS\nDEVOURED BY FIRE ANTS. THIS BILL\nHURTS THE FOUR YEAR OLD BABY WHO\nWENT IN FOR A RANDOM\nTONSILLECTOMY. HIS WOUND WASN'T\nSUTURED PROPERLY, AND BY THE\nTIME HE GOT TO THE DRIVEWAY OF\nHIS HOME, HE BLED TO DEATH IN\nFRONT OF HIS MOTHER AND HIS\nBROTHER AND HIS SISTER. THESE\nARE THE PEOPLE, THE BACKS UPON\nWHOM THIS BILL.\n>> BUT REPUBLICANS PUSHED BACK.\n>> THERE'S NOT ONE LINE IN THIS\nBILL. NOWHERE THAT DOES NOT\nALLOW A RAPE VICTIM TO BRING A\nCLAIM. NOT ONE. NOT ONE LINE IN\nTHIS BILL DOES THAT. NOWHERE. IT\nIS DISINGENUOUS TO SAY SO.\n>> THE BILL PASSED 91-82 JUST\nBARELY REACHING THE VOTES\nREQUIRED FOR PASSAGE. A HANDFUL\nOF REPRESENTATIVES VOTED ACROSS\nPARTY LINES. SB 68 WAS\nIMMEDIATELY TRANSMITTED BACK TO\nTHE SENATE FOR FINAL APPROVAL OF\nTHE HOUSE. CHANGES, WHICH\nINCLUDED EXCEPTIONS FOR SEX\nTRAFFICKING VICTIMS. SPEAKER OF\nTHE HOUSE JON BURNS PRAISED THE\nPASSAGE OF THE BILL AND SAID THE\nHOUSE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO\nCURB INSURANCE COSTS.\n>> THAT'S THE REASON WE ARE\nCREATING A HOUSE STUDY COMMITTEE\nON INSURANCE MARKET REFORM. WE\nALL KNOW THAT INSURANCE COVERAGE\nIS VITAL FOR THE SUCCESS OF\nWELL-BEING AND THE WELL-BEING OF\nINDIVIDUALS, INDIVIDUALS, AND\nBUSINESSES. AND FOR TOO LONG,\nINSURANCE PREMIUMS HAVE BEEN\nINCREASING AT AN ALARMING RATE.\n>> THE SENATE TOOK UP TWO HOUSE\nBILLS DEALING WITH STATE TAXES.\nHB 111 WILL REDUCE THE STATE TAX\nRATE FROM THE CURRENT 5.3 9-5\n0.19%, WITH AN ADDITIONAL 0.1\nPERCENTAGE EVERY YEAR UNTIL IT\nREACHES 4.99.\n>> WHILE OTHER STATES ARE\nRAISING TAXES ON THEIR CITIZENS\nAT A TIME WHEN THEY'RE FACING\nSKY HIGH PRICES AND CAN LEAST\nAFFORD IT. WE ARE DOING THE\nOPPOSITE HERE IN GEORGIA. WE'RE\nPUTTING MONEY BACK IN THE HANDS\nOF GEORGIANS, WHICH THIS BILL,\nHB 111, DOES.\n>> DEMOCRATS SAY THAT THIS TAX\nREDUCTION BILL JUST BENEFITS THE\nRICH.\n>> THIS LEGISLATION WILL COST\n748 MILLION. ONLY 33% OF IT WILL\nGO TO 80% OF GEORGIANS. 67% OF\nIT WILL GO TO THE TOP 20%.\nAGAIN, ANOTHER WAY OF PUTTING\nIT, BUT IT'S A TAX CUT FOR THE\nRICH.\n>> HB 112 WILL PROVIDE FROM $250\nTO $500 REBATES. IF YOU FILE\nSTATE TAXES DURING 2024 AND\n2025. BOTH BILLS WERE PASSED. HB\n423 WOULD MOVE THE EXISTING\nSTATE 911 SYSTEM TO A MORE\nMODERN INTERNET PROTOCOL, OR IP\nSYSTEM, ALLOWING DIFFERENT\nELECTRONIC DEVICES AND SYSTEMS\nTO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER.\n>> MOVING THIS TO THE NEXT\nGENERATION, AS MOST OTHER STATES\nHAVE ALREADY DONE, WILL ALLOW US\nTO SIGNIFICANTLY UPGRADE THE\nAVAILABILITY OF 911 OPERATIONS.\nTHE ABILITY IN ORDER TO HAVE\nBUSINESS CONTINUITY BETWEEN\nMULTIPLE 911 CENTERS AND REALLY\nBRING US INTO THE 21st CENTURY.\n>> THE NEW SYSTEM SHOULD BE\nBETTER EQUIPPED TO HANDLE MORE\nCALLERS WITHOUT ANY WAIT TIME\nFOR ESSENTIAL SERVICES. AND IF\nYOUR HORSE HATES FIREWORKS, YOU\nARE NOT ALONE. HB 614 WOULD\nALLOW MUNICIPALITIES AND\nCOUNTIES TO OUTLAW FIREWORKS\nWITHIN 200 YARDS OF STABLES OR\nOTHER EQUINE FACILITIES.\n>> THE LOUD, SUDDEN NOISE NEAR\nHORSE FARMS ARE DANGEROUS TO THE\nPEOPLE THAT OWN AND RIDE HORSES,\nAND TO THE HORSES THEMSELVES.\nTHERE'S ALSO A FIRE THREAT FROM\nFIREWORKS. SINCE MANY HORSES ARE\nHOUSED IN WOODEN BARNS WITH\nBALES OF HAY.\n>> THE BILL WAS OVERWHELMINGLY\nPASSED, BUT DID RECEIVE ONE NAY.\nTOMORROW, THE SENATE IS EXPECTED\nTO CONSIDER THE HOUSE'S\nAMENDMENTS TO SENATE BILL 68.\nTHAT'S ALL FROM MY CAPITOL\nREPORT, DONNA.\n>> THANKS, SARAH. WHEN MARTY\nKEMP BECAME GEORGIA'S FIRST LADY\nIN 2019, SHE KNEW WHERE SHE\nWANTED TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN\nTHE STATE. WHEN I SPOKE TO HER\nRECENTLY, THE MOTHER OF THREE\nGIRLS TOLD ME THAT HER INTEREST\nIN FIGHTING HUMAN TRAFFICKING\nBEGAN BEFORE HER HUSBAND WAS\nELECTED GOVERNOR.\n>> WE WENT TO THE ATLANTIC\nSTATION, WHERE THEY WERE HAVING\nA, YOU KNOW, A PRESS CONFERENCE\nPRETTY MUCH JUST TALKING ABOUT\nHUMAN TRAFFICKING. THEY HAD 72\nSCHOOL BUSSES, WHICH REPRESENTED\nTHE 3,600 KIDS THAT WERE TAKEN\nINTO TRAFFICKING A YEAR EVERY\nYEAR IN GEORGIA. AND I WAS LIKE,\nTHAT CANNOT HAPPEN. THAT THAT\nCAN'T BE. YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN\nTRAVELING, CAMPAIGNING AROUND\nTHE STATE FOR TWO AND A HALF\nYEARS, AND I'VE NEVER HEARD\nANYTHING ABOUT THIS. I STARTED\nLEARNING MORE ABOUT IT. THE TEAM\nBROUGHT IT TO ME. WE FORMED THE\nGRACE COMMISSION, WHICH BROUGHT\nALL THE EXPERTS TO THE TABLE.\nLAW ENFORCEMENT, NONPROFIT,\nBUSINESSES, CORPORATIONS, AND\nJUST REALLY TALKED ABOUT IT\nLIKE, WHAT IS WHAT'S GOING ON?\nWHAT IS EVERYBODY DOING? WHAT DO\nWE NEED TO DO? AND IT NEEDED TO\nHAVE MORE EDUCATION AND\nAWARENESS, AND WE NEEDED TO HAVE\nHARSHER PENALTIES. AND WE HAVE\nDONE THAT.\n>> EXPLAIN THE WHAT THE ACRONYM\nGRACE IS.\n>> SO IT'S GEORGIANS FOR REFUGE,\nACTION, COMPASSION AND\nEDUCATION. SO WE HAVE NOW\nGRACE'S PLACE, WHICH IS A\nFACILITY THAT INTAKE WHERE WE\nHAVE SURVIVORS COME AND GET THE\nWRAPAROUND SERVICES THAT THEY\nNEED. SO THAT'S BEEN AN\nOPERATION FOR A YEAR. AND I\nPRETTY MUCH WANT THAT. WOULD\nLOVE TO HAVE THAT FACILITY BE A\nMODEL FOR THE COUNTRY BECAUSE IT\nHAS EVERYTHING THAT THEY NEED.\nAND SO THAT THAT WOULD BE VERY\nHELPFUL FOR OTHER STATES TO TAKE\nTHAT ON. SO WE'RE HOPEFULLY\nGOING TO BUILD OUR THIRD\nFACILITY BEFORE HE GETS OUT OF\nOFFICE, WHICH I'D LIKE TO SEE,\nYOU KNOW, FIVE OR SIX.\nUNFORTUNATELY THEY'RE NEEDED.\nBUT IT'S ALSO GETTING THE\nSURVIVORS THE HELP THAT THEY\nNEED THAT THEY DESERVE.\n>> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT\nSURPRISED ME WAS HOW PERVASIVE\nTHIS IS. WE TEND TO THINK THAT\nIT IS A METRO ATLANTA PROBLEM,\nRIGHT? BUT IT'S NOT.\n>> RIGHT. IT IS NOT. AND I\nREMEMBER I THINK THE STATISTIC\nTHEY GAVE ME BACK IN, MAYBE WE\nTALKED ABOUT IT IN 21 WAS, YOU\nKNOW, IT WAS IN 140 OR 147 OF\n159 COUNTIES. AND I SAID FROM\nTHE BEGINNING, IT'S IN 159\nCOUNTIES. WE JUST DON'T KNOW\nHOW TO RECOGNIZE IT. SO WE HAVE\nALSO TAUGHT LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE\nHAVE A TRAINING THAT'S JUST 30\nMINUTES. IT'S ON THE WEBSITE OF\nTHE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE UNDER THE\nFIRST LADY GRACE COMMISSION. AND\nIT JUST SHOWS YOU THE THINGS TO\nLOOK FOR AND WHAT TO RECOGNIZE.\nIT'S 30 MINUTES IN YOUR\nEVERYDAY LIFE. IF YOU'RE OUT\nSHOPPING, GOING TO THE AIRPORT,\nTRAVELING, WHATEVER IT IS, IF\nYOU SEE SOMETHING, SAY\nSOMETHING. IF YOU'RE WRONG,\nTHAT'S OKAY. YOU CALL LAW\nENFORCEMENT AND YOU'RE YOU'RE\nWRONG. THAT'S FINE. BUT WHAT IF\nYOU SAVE SOMEBODY'S LIFE? I\nMEAN, WHAT IF YOU CAN CALL AND\nGET THAT INDIVIDUAL OUT OF\nHARM'S WAY WOULD BE FABULOUS.\n>> HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU\nESTIMATE YOU'VE TRAINED OVER\nTHE.\n>> LAST FEW YEARS? WELL, BRIAN\nWANTED TO HAVE THE TRAINING\nBACK, AND I GUESS WE DID THAT\nBACK IN 2020 OR 21 TO TO REALLY\nENCOURAGE, NOT MANDATE OR, YOU\nKNOW, MAKE PEOPLE TAKE IT, BUT\nENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO TAKE IT FOR\nALL STATE EMPLOYEES. AND I THINK\nTHERE'S 83,000 STATE EMPLOYEES.\nAND THE AGENCIES TOOK THAT UPON\nAND DID HAVE THEIR INDIVIDUAL\nEMPLOYER EMPLOYEES TAKE IT. SO I\nMEAN THAT RIGHT THERE. BUT I\nKNOW, I MEAN, I HAVE PEOPLE COME\nUP TO ME ALL THE TIME AND SAY,\nHOW CAN I HELP? HOW CAN I GET\nINVOLVED? AND I SAID, TAKE THE\nTRAINING. AND THEY DO. AND I'VE\nHAD, YOU KNOW, I ENCOURAGE THEM\nTO TELL THEIR PEOPLE THAT THEY\nWORSHIP WITH, THAT THEY WORK\nWITH. JUST TAKE IT. IT'S 30\nMINUTES AND IT'S.\n>> THE EDUCATION AND AWARENESS\nTHAT YOU REALLY HAVE. YOU'VE\nBEEN ABLE TO BRING TO LIGHT FOR\nSO MANY PEOPLE. I KNOW THAT MUST\nBE SOMETHING YOU'RE PROUD OF.\n>> WELL, I AM PROUD OF IT. I\nHAVE PEOPLE COME UP AND TALK TO\nME ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME, AND\nI'M REALLY GLAD IT'S IT'S AN\nUGLY TOPIC. NOBODY WANTS TO TALK\nABOUT IT. AND I COMPLETELY\nUNDERSTAND THAT. BUT I LIKE TO\nTAKE ON TOPICS THAT ARE, YOU\nKNOW, THAT PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO\nTALK ABOUT. I'M NOT AFRAID OF\nTHAT UGLINESS BECAUSE THESE\nINDIVIDUALS, YOU KNOW, HAVE HAD\nA VERY TOUGH CHILDHOOD LIFE, AND\nTHEY DESERVE SOMEBODY STANDING\nUP AND FIGHTING FOR THEM. AND\nI'M GOING TO DO THAT. AND I'VE\nTOLD THEM THAT I'VE HAD\nSURVIVORS COME TO THE GRACE\nCOMMISSION MEETINGS. AND AT THE\nEND WE HAVE OPEN PUBLIC\nCOMMENTS. AND I HAD A COUPLE OF\nTHEM COME DOWN AND REALLY RAKE\nME OVER THE COALS AND TELL ME I\nDIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS TALKING\nABOUT. AND I SAID, YOU KNOW,\nYOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT. I DON'T I\nDON'T KNOW THE HELL THAT YOU\nHAVE BEEN THROUGH, BUT I AM HERE\nTO HELP YOU. AND IF I ONLY HELP\nONE PERSON, IF WE ONLY HELP ONE\nPERSON, IT'S WORTH IT TO ME.\nBUT YOU CAN SIT AT THIS TABLE.\nYOU CAN SIT ON THE GRACE\nCOMMISSION AND PUT YOUR. GIVE US\nYOUR INPUT. AND THEY WERE A HUGE\nPART OF THE VACANT BILL. WE HAD\nTHEM COME IN AND TALK TO OUR\nPOLICY TEAM, AND THEY WERE A\nHUGE PART OF THAT. AND THEY\nSAID, YOU KNOW, NOBODY'S EVER\nASKED US. NOBODY HAS EVER ASKED\nHOW WE THOUGHT. AND I'M LIKE,\nHOW COULD WE NOT LEARN FROM, YOU\nKNOW, WE CAN LEARN SO MUCH FROM\nTHEM IF THEY'RE WILLING TO TALK\nABOUT IT. AND IF THEY DON'T WANT\nTO TALK ABOUT IT, I COMPLETELY\nUNDERSTAND, BUT I HAD A GROUP OF\nTHEM COME TO LUNCH AT THE\nMANSION, AND WE SAT THERE AND\nTALKED WITH SOME OTHER NONPROFIT\nORGANIZATIONS. IT WAS VERY EYE\nOPENING TO ME, AND IT WAS VERY\nTOUGH. AND BRIAN CAME HOME THAT\nNIGHT AND HE SAID, ARE YOU OKAY?\nAND I SAID, NO, THIS IS AN UGLY\nTOPIC, BUT WE'RE GOING TO IT'S\nNOT GOING TO KNOCK ME DOWN.\nWE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT\nAND WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE GOING\nTO GET THESE PEOPLE AND PUT THEM\nIN JAIL FOR A LONG TIME.\n>> I'M SURE IT'S BEEN TOUGH TO\nTAKE IT ALL IN. RIGHT. YOU KNOW,\nAND.\n>> YOU KNOW, IT'S TOUGH TO TALK\nTO THEM AND I HUG THEM AND AND\nJUST FEEL FOR THEM THAT, YOU\nKNOW, PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND IN\nTHEIR EVERYDAY LIFE THAT THEY'RE\nGOING ON WHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING\nON IN THEIR LIFE. YOU KNOW,\nIT'S JUST REALLY, REALLY TOUGH\nAND JUST REALLY UGLY.\n>> I THINK THE BEST THING IS,\nYOU SAID THEY CAME TO YOU\nBECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT YOU'RE\nINVOLVED IN THIS TOPIC. THAT HAS\nMADE IT EASIER, I BET.\n>> I THINK SO. YOU KNOW, I FEEL\nLIKE PEOPLE LIKE WHEN I TRAVEL\nAROUND THE STATE WITH BRIAN,\nWHICH PEOPLE MAKE FUN OF ME FOR\nTRAVELING EVERYWHERE. BUT I FEEL\nLIKE, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE FEEL LIKE\nTHEY CAN COME UP AND ASK ME\nTHINGS, AND THEY CAN ALSO SHARE\nTHINGS WITH ME THAT THEY MAY NOT\nFEEL AS COMFORTABLE GOING TO\nTALK TO HIM ABOUT. EVEN THOUGH\nHE'S VERY APPROACHABLE, I THINK.\nBUT, YOU KNOW, THEY FEEL LIKE\nTHEY CAN COME SPEAK TO ME ABOUT\nISSUES. AND, YOU KNOW, WE'VE HAD\nEVERYTHING FROM, YOU KNOW,\nMAKING YOUR CDL LICENSE, TAKING\nIT AWAY FOR GOOD. IF YOU'RE\nCAUGHT USING YOUR YOU KNOW,\nTRUCK AS A HUMAN TRAFFICKING\nTOOL, YOU KNOW, TO, TO ENTICE\nYOUNG GIRLS, BUT THAT , THAT\nTAKES IT AWAY FOR LIFE. I MEAN,\nIT'S IT'S NOT JUST A SLAP ON\nTHE HAND. WE MEAN BUSINESS HERE.\nAND I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT\nIF, AS BRIAN SAID, IN THE STATE\nOF THE STATE, IF YOU MESS WITH\nOUR CHILDREN, WE'RE COMING AFTER\nYOU.\n>> YEAH. YOU'VE HIT ALL LEVELS\nFROM THE TRUCK DRIVERS YOU\nMENTIONED TO HELPING THE GIRLS,\nTO GOING AFTER THE PIMPS.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. AND ANYBODY THAT\nPROFITS, YOU KNOW, THE HOTEL\nCLERK THAT IS AT THE FRONT DESK,\nTHEY'RE SEEING EVERYTHING\nTHAT'S GOING ON. SO THEY NEED\nTO KNOW THAT THEY CAN BE A PART\nOF OUR TEAM, NOT A PART OF THAT\nTEAM. AND IF THEY ARE A PART OF\nTHAT TEAM, THEY CAN GET SUED AS\nWELL. AND I AND THERE IS A\nLAWSUIT RIGHT NOW THAT IS\nBECAUSE OF OUR BILL. AND IT THIS\nTHIS YOUNG INDIVIDUAL WAS\nTRAFFICKED IN 2014. SO WE'RE\nGOING BACK AND TRYING HELPING\nTHEM, YOU KNOW , GET SOME\nCOMPENSATION. THEY HAVE NOTHING\nWHEN THEY COME OUT. THEY DON'T\nEVEN BARELY HAVE THE CLOTHES ON\nTHEIR BACK. SO WE WANT TO TRY TO\nHELP THEM IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE.\nAND THAT WAS ONE THING THAT WAS\nVERY IMPORTANT, WAS NOT ONLY\nHAVING THE HARSHER PENALTIES,\nBUT NOT FORGETTING ABOUT THESE\nVICTIMS. ONCE THEY GET OUT, WE\nNEED TO TAKE CARE OF THEM. THEY\nDESERVE THAT. AND SO WE'VE\nWE'VE TRIED TO DO THAT.\n>> IS THERE SOMETHING YOU'RE\nMOST PROUD OF IN ALL OF THIS?\n>> I THINK JUST PEOPLE BEING\nAWARE AND FEELING LIKE THEY CAN\nTALK ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW, WE'VE\nHAD THE UTILITY COMPANIES, WE'VE\nHAD THE BEER AND WHOLESALES.\nTHEY WANT TO PUT STICKERS ON\nTHEIR CAR. I MEAN, EVERYBODY IS\nIS JOINED TOGETHER AND WANT TO\nBE A PART OF THE TEAM TO TRY TO\nHELP THESE VICTIMS, BECAUSE I\nTHINK A LOT OF PEOPLE FELT LIKE,\nOH, THAT DOESN'T THAT DOESN'T\nAPPLY TO ME, THAT THAT HADN'T\nHAPPENED. THAT DOESN'T THAT'S\nNOT GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME. WELL,\nIT CAN IT CAN HAPPEN TO ANYBODY.\nIT DOES NOT HAVE A HALL PASS AT\nALL. SO, YOU KNOW, WITH OUR BIG\nBUSY AIRPORTS, WE HAVE A PSA\nTHERE THAT THE MAYOR AND\nREPRESENTATIVE BAZEMORE, BRIAN\nAND I AND TYLER PERRY ALL JOINED\nTOGETHER AND TALKING ABOUT IT.\nSO IT'S A IT'S A, YOU KNOW,\nNONPARTIZAN ISSUE THAT WE ARE\nALL COMING TOGETHER. AND LIKE I\nSAID, THE LEGISLATORS HAVE\nPASSED THAT UNANIMOUSLY. SO THEY\nARE ALL ON BOARD. SO THAT'S VERY\nGOOD.\n>> IS THERE MORE THAT YOU WANT\nTO SEE DONE?\n>> YOU KNOW, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE\nMORE FACILITIES. I WOULD LIKE TO\nSEE INDIVIDUALS GET HELPED MORE.\nAND JUST HAVE, YOU KNOW,\nTHERE'S BUSINESSES THAT HAVE\nCOME FORWARD THAT WANT TO HELP,\nYOU KNOW, HAVE EMPLOYMENT FOR\nTHEM. SO JUST TALKING ABOUT THAT\nMORE, BUT HAVING THE FACILITIES\nTO HAVE THEM HEAL AND JUST THEY\nNEED TO FEEL SAFE. AND I WANT\nTHEM TO FEEL SAFE AND KNOW THAT\nTHERE IS AN OUTLET, THERE IS AN\nOPTION TO THIS. AND WE'RE COMING\nAFTER THE PERPETRATORS. WE'RE\nCOMING AFTER THE BAD PEOPLE.\nWE'RE GOING TO PUT THEM AWAY\nFOR A LONG TIME. I MEAN, THE\nATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE HAS\nRESCUED ALMOST 200 VICTIMS. I\nMEAN, THAT'S GREAT. 200 VICTIMS\nTHAT ARE OUT OF THAT LIFE. THAT\nMAKES ME PROUD.\n>> THE FIRST LADY SAYS THE\nAMENDED BUDGET THAT THE GOVERNOR\nSIGNED RECENTLY ADDS ANOTHER\n$1.2 MILLION TO THE HUMAN\nTRAFFICKING PROSECUTION UNIT.\nSHE SAYS THEY'RE SO BUSY, THEY\nREQUESTED ANOTHER PROSECUTOR. I\nWANT TO THANK HER FOR THAT\nINTERVIEW, BUT THE FIRST LADY IS\nNOT FINISHED TRYING TO CHANGE\nLAWS TO STOP HUMAN TRAFFICKING.\nCOMING UP, WE'LL TALK WITH\nLEGISLATORS FROM BOTH SIDES OF\nTHE AISLE ABOUT THE BILLS SHE'S\nPUSHING. NOW. WE'LL HEAR FROM A\nREPUBLICAN SENATOR AND FROM THE\nHOUSE DEMOCRATIC REPRESENTATIVE,\nSTACEY EVANS. THIS IS LAWMAKERS\nON GPB.\n>> GEORGIA FARM BUREAU, A\nGRASSROOTS ORGANIZATION\nDEDICATED TO PRESERVING GEORGIA\nAGRICULTURE. FARM BUREAU\nADVOCATES FOR ALL GEORGIA\nFARMERS AT THE STATE CAPITOL\nDURING THE SESSION AND YEAR\nROUND. GEORGIA FARM BUREAU, THE\nVOICE OF GEORGIA FARMERS.\n>> I'M A QUEEN. I DON'T FEAR\nANYONE.\n>> THIS IS A WOMAN PEOPLE WANTED\nTO FOLLOW. YOU ARE AN IMPORTANT\nPART OF OUR WORK.\n>> YOU'RE STRONGER THAN YOU\nKNOW. SADDLE MY HORSE\nIMMEDIATELY.\n>> SHE'S A FEMALE TRAILBLAZER.\nWE DID IT BY ACKNOWLEDGING OUR\nOWN WORTH.\n>> OH, PLEASE DO CONTINUE.\n>> I GOT MY HEAD OUT THE\nSUNROOF. WHOA, WHOA WHOA WHOA.\nDA DA DA DA DA.\n>> UNDERSTANDING THE PAST GIVES\nA SENSE OF THE FUTURE.\n>> HEART LIKE A LION.\n>> THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT\nANYONE HAS SEEN THIS IN 2000\nYEARS.\n>> OH OH OH OH. SOMETHING BIG IS\nHAPPENING. SO HURRY UP. WE'RE\nDIVING IN.\n>> THIS IS AMAZING.\n>> WELL, I'M EXCITED NOW.\n>> POMPEII IS A BATTLE AGAINST\nTIME .\n>> EYES WIDE OPEN. EYES OPEN.\n>> DO YOU THINK I'M JOKING? BUT\nLOOK AT THIS. IT DID REALLY\nHAPPEN.\n>> DON'T LET ANYBODY TELL YOU\nWHO YOU ARE.\n>> YEAH, I LOVE THIS LIFE.\n>> HISTORY TEACHES US TO HONOR\nTHE PAST.\n>> WE'RE JUMPING IN WITH OUR\nEYES WIDE OPEN.\n>> WHEN YOU LOOK BACK, YOU'RE\nLIKE, WOW, THAT WAS PRETTY\nSPECIAL.\n>> THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S\nACTUALLY ALTERING THE COURSE OF\nHISTORY.\n>> YOU'RE CHARGED WITH KEEPING\nTHESE STORIES ALIVE.\n>> I KNOW THAT YOU.\n>> WELCOME BACK TO LAWMAKERS.\nI'M DONNA LOWRY. OVER THE\nYEARS, FIRST LADY MARTY KEMP HAS\nPUSHED FOR NINE ANTI-TRAFFICKING\nBILLS THAT HAVE BECOME LAWS, AND\nSHE'S WORKING ON THE TENTH.\nAMONG THE LAWS, ONE THAT MAKES\nIT A FELONY TO GROOM A MINOR.\nANOTHER ALLOWS HUMAN TRAFFICKING\nSURVIVORS TO PETITION COURTS TO\nHAVE THEIR SENTENCES VACATED FOR\nCRIMES COMMITTED WHILE THEY WERE\nVICTIMIZED. AND THERE'S NOW A\nLAW THAT REQUIRES CERTAIN\nBUSINESSES TO DISPLAY THE HUMAN\nTRAFFICKING HOTLINE. NOW, THE\nSPONSOR OF THE TENTH BILL, SB\n42, IS REPUBLICAN SENATOR BO\nHATCHETT OF CORNELIA. I SPOKE\nWITH HIM EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON\nABOUT IT.\n>> FIRST OFF.\n>> I WANT TO THANK FIRST LADY\nKEMP FOR ALL SHE'S DONE IN THE\nSTATE FOR SEX TRAFFICKING\nVICTIMS. IT'S REALLY SHE TOOK\nON A LION'S TASK AND HAS DONE\nAN INCREDIBLE JOB. SO I WAS\nHONORED TO CARRY HER TENTH BILL,\nWHICH DEALS WITH ISSUE IN THE\nLAW CALLED THE RULE OF LENITY.\nAND IT BASICALLY MEANS IF THERE\nARE TWO CRIMES THAT ARE SIMILAR\nENOUGH TO WHERE THEY COULD\nOVERLAP, THAT A JUDGE HAS TO\nGIVE THE DEFENDANT THE LESSER\nPENALTY. AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS\nWHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH SEX\nTRAFFICKING A MINOR, THERE HAVE\nBEEN TWO JUDGES THAT HAVE STATED\nTHAT THE THAT CRIME OVERLAPS\nWITH PIMPING AND PANDERING OF A\nMINOR, AND WHAT WE BASICALLY\nHAVE TO DO IS MAKE THAT\nCORRECTION SO THAT WHEN SOMEONE\nDOES SEX TRAFFICKING A MINOR,\nTHAT THEY WILL GET THE FULLEST\nEXTENT OF THE PENALTY AVAILABLE.\n>> AS I UNDERSTAND IT,\nPROSECUTORS CAME TO THE FIRST\nLADY ABOUT THIS.\n>> THAT'S RIGHT. THEY DID.\nIT'S BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN TWO\nJUDGES, ONE IN CHEROKEE COUNTY\nAND ONE IN COBB COUNTY, THAT\nBROUGHT THIS RULE OF LENITY\nISSUE TO US, OR TO THE FIRST\nLADY. AND THEN WE WERE ABLE TO\nCRAFT LEGISLATION AROUND IT TO\nMAKE SURE THAT WHEN SOMEONE DOES\nSEX TRAFFICKING A MINOR, THEY\nARE PUNISHED TO THE FULL EXTENT\nOF THE LAW. AND THIS\nTECHNICALITY DOESN'T ALLOW THEM\nTO GET OFF A LITTLE BIT EASIER.\n>> THE GOOD THING ABOUT ALL OF\nTHIS IS THE ATTENTION THAT'S\nBEEN DRAWN TO IT. IT'S MAKING\nPEOPLE WITHIN THE SYSTEM\nUNDERSTAND WHAT'S NEEDED TO BE\nABLE TO GET YOU GUYS TO DO WHAT\nYOU NEED TO DO TO MAKE THE LAWS\nSTRONGER, RIGHT?\n>> THAT'S RIGHT. I MEAN, THE\nGRACE COMMISSION AND OTHER\nADVOCATES AROUND THE STATE, NOT\nJUST FOR THIS ISSUE, BUT OTHER\nISSUES. THAT'S THEY BRING US\nIDEAS AND THEY BRING US ISSUES\nTHAT WE DON'T ALWAYS SEE. AND I\nTHINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE\nTO SEND TO PEOPLE. IF YOU DO\nHAVE AN ISSUE, GET ENGAGED, GET\nINVOLVED, REACH OUT TO YOUR\nLEGISLATOR BECAUSE YOU NEVER\nKNOW WHAT COULD BE A WHAT COULD\nBE WRITTEN INTO A PIECE OF\nLEGISLATION AND WHAT COULD BE\nBROUGHT UP NEXT SESSION.\n>> AND THEY THINK THE GREAT\nTHING ABOUT THIS IN THE SENATE,\nOVERWHELMING SUPPORT.\n>> OH, YEAH, I DON'T THINK THERE\nWAS A NO VOTE. IT WAS A GREAT\nPIECE OF LEGISLATION MOVING\nTHROUGH THE HOUSE NOW, AND\nHOPEFULLY WE'LL GET IT PASSED\nDEFINITELY BEFORE SIGNING DAY.\nBUT I'D LIKE TO SEE IT PASSED\nTOMORROW IF WE CAN GET IT. TIP\nMY HAT TO MARTY KEMP AND ALL\nTHAT SHE'S DOING. SHE TOOK ON A\nVERY IMPORTANT ISSUE IN THE\nSTATE, AND HER EFFORTS ARE BEING\nSEEN AND SAVING LIVES.\n>> AND IT'S NOT AN EASY ISSUE.\nIT'S IT'S SOMETHING A LOT OF\nPEOPLE DON'T WANT TO TALK\nABOUT.\n>> NO. YOU'RE RIGHT, AND IT'S\nUNCOMFORTABLE. BUT I'LL SAY\nTHAT IN MY YEARS HERE, THE\nVICTIMS THAT HAVE COME FORWARD\nAND THAT HAVE TESTIFIED IN\nCOMMITTEE AND SHOWN THEIR\nBRAVERY HAVE HAS MADE A HUGE\nIMPACT. AND THE STORIES THAT\nTHEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO TELL HAVE\nHELPED US CONTINUE TO CRAFT\nLEGISLATION TO PROTECT FUTURE\nVICTIMS. SO I WANT TO THANK THEM\nAND THANK THE GOVERNOR AND THE\nFIRST LADY FOR ALL, ALL THE WORK\nTHAT THEY'VE DONE, BECAUSE THIS\nIS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE.\n>> AND I WANT TO THANK SENATOR\nHATCHETT FOR THAT INTERVIEW.\nNOW, HIS BILL IS NOW IN THE\nHOUSE WHERE OUR NEXT GUEST WILL\nVOTE ON IT. DEMOCRATIC\nREPRESENTATIVE STACEY EVANS OF\nATLANTA. HER COMMITTEE IN THE\nHOUSE INCLUDE APPROPRIATIONS,\nJUDICIARY AND RULES. AND THANK\nYOU FOR COMING ON THE SHOW.\n>> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING\nME.\n>> SO LET'S START A LITTLE BIT\nWITH SENATOR HATCH'S BILL, THIS\nSB 42 AND WHAT IT MIGHT DO. WHAT\nCAN YOU TELL US ANYTHING MORE.\n>> IT'S A GREAT BILL AND IT'S A\nGREAT EXAMPLE, DONNA, OF WHY\nIT'S IMPORTANT FOR IF YOU SEE\nSOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING.\nKNOWING THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT\nFIGURED OUT THIS ISSUE AND\nBROUGHT IT TO THE FIRST LADY,\nAND THEN WE WERE ABLE TO ACT\nUPON IT, BECAUSE THERE ARE SO\nMANY WAYS THAT OUR LAWS WORK\nTOGETHER, THAT THOSE OF US UNDER\nTHE DOME MAY NOT REALIZE IF WE\nDON'T WORK IN THAT AREA, IF\nWE'RE JUST NOT AWARE OF IT. AND\nSO I ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE, IF YOU\nSEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING,\nDON'T ASSUME THAT I KNOW WHAT\nYOU KNOW. BRING IT TO ME. AND\nTHIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT\nWORKING OUT REALLY WELL TO MAKE\nSURE THAT WE CLOSE THE LOOPHOLE\nAND THAT WE HOLD THESE PEOPLE\nACCOUNTABLE AS MUCH AS WE CAN.\n>> YEAH. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nOVERALL ON WHAT THE FIRST LADY\nHAS DONE WITH THE TENT? THIS IS\nHER TENTH BILL OVER THE YEARS ON\nTHIS TOPIC OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING.\n>> IT'S AMAZING. I MEAN, I AM\nSO GRATEFUL FOR GEORGIA, FOR\nTHESE VICTIMS THAT WE HAVE.\nFIRSTLY, MARTY KEMP AND HER\nWHOLE HEART AND HER WHOLE EFFORT\nIS INTO THIS. AND AND WE HAVE\nHER TO THANK. I REMEMBER WHEN I\nFIRST CAME TO THE CAPITOL IN\n2011, THAT WAS MY FIRST SESSION,\nAND PEOPLE DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO\nSAY THE WORDS SEX TRAFFICKING.\nNOBODY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IT.\nAND SLOWLY BUT SURELY WE\nSTARTED. BUT THEN WHEN GOVERNOR\nKEMP WAS ELECTED AND MARTY KEMP\nBECAME OUR FIRST LADY, IT'S JUST\nEXPLODED. THE THE HELP FOR THESE\nVICTIMS. AND IT'S AMAZING.\n>> AND THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE\nTHEY HAVE TO HIDE FROM HER AT\nLEAST AND GET GETTING THAT\nINFORMATION OUT. SO IT'S TAKEN\nAWAY SOME SHAME. I WANT TO TALK\nABOUT ANOTHER BILL. YOU'RE A\nSIGNER ON REPRESENTATIVE DEBRA\nBAZEMORE BILL, HB 490. THAT\nWOULD REQUIRE HOTELS TO PROVIDE\nHUMAN TRAFFICKING TRAINING\nPROGRAMS. TALK ABOUT THAT A\nLITTLE BIT.\n>> IT'S A GREAT PIECE OF\nLEGISLATION THAT JUST\nCOMPLEMENTS ALL THAT'S GOING ON.\nTHESE SEX TRAFFICKING VICTIMS\nARE BROUGHT INTO THESE MOTELS BY\nTHEIR PIMPS, AND THE HOTEL\nRECEPTIONIST, THE FOLKS THAT\nWORK THERE THAT MIGHT CLEAN THE\nROOMS THAT DO SECURITY, THEY\nNEED TO KNOW WHAT TO LOOK OUT\nFOR. AND SO I THINK THIS WOULD\nJUST BE A GREAT WAY TO HAVE MORE\nEYES ON THE PROBLEM, TO TRY TO\nCATCH THINGS BEFORE THEY GET OUT\nOF HAND, OR CERTAINLY TO SAVE\nTHESE WOMEN FROM FROM THIS HARM\nTHAT'S HAPPENING TO THEM.\nUNFORTUNATELY, THAT BILL DID NOT\nMOVE IN THE HOUSE, BUT OBVIOUSLY\nWE'RE IN THE FIRST YEAR OF A\nTWO YEAR SESSION. AND SO WE'LL\nLOOK FORWARD TO HOPEFULLY\nPASSING THAT OUT NEXT YEAR. OR\nIF OUR FRIENDS IN THE SENATE SEE\nFIT TO ADD IT TO SOMETHING\nTHAT'S MOVING OVER THERE, OR WE\nCAN ADD IT ON TO SOMETHING ON\nOUR SIDE, I HOPE THAT WE WILL.\n>> OKAY, WELL, LET'S GET ON TO\nYOUR AN ATTORNEY AND YOU\nPRESENTED THE MINORITY REPORT\nTODAY ON THE TORT REFORM BILL.\nAND ONE OF THE AREAS YOU\nADDRESSED IS THE CARVE OUT FOR\nSEX TRAFFICKING VICTIMS THAT\nCAME OUT UP AFTER THE SENATE\nPASSED IT. TELL US WHAT YOU\nTHINK OF THAT PART OF THE\nLEGISLATION.\n>> SO SENATE BILL 68 IS A BIG\nREWRITE OF SOME OF OUR CIVIL\nJUSTICE LAWS, CIVIL PROCEDURE,\nAND ONE SPECIFIC AREA THAT'S\nADDRESSED IS WHAT'S KNOWN AS\nPREMISES LIABILITY. AND HOW YOU\nHOLD OWNERS AND OCCUPIERS LIABLE\nWHEN PEOPLE GET HURT ON THEIR\nPROPERTY, WHEN THEY HAVE DROPPED\nTHE BALL ON SECURITY AND ALLOW\nFOLKS TO GET HURT, EVEN THOUGH\nTHEY'RE INVITING CUSTOMERS ONTO\nTHEIR PROPERTY. AND SO FOR SEX\nTRAFFICKING, THIS RELATES MOSTLY\nTO THE MOTELS AND THE WAY THAT\nTHE BILL WAS WRITTEN BEFORE\nWOULD HAVE MADE IT NEARLY\nIMPOSSIBLE FOR SEX TRAFFICKING\nVICTIMS TO HOLD THE HOTELS\nACCOUNTABLE. AND I CAN'T SAY\nENOUGH HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE\nTHAT. GOVERNOR KEMP AND SENATOR\nKENNEDY AND THOSE THAT WERE\nWORKING ON THIS BILL, MADE THIS\nCARVE OUT SO THAT THE NEW HIGHER\nSTANDARDS AND THE NEW CONDITIONS\nTHAT YOU HAVE TO MEET TO BRING A\nNEGLIGENT SECURITY CASE WILL NOT\nAPPLY IF YOU ARE A VICTIM OF SEX\nTRAFFICKING. AND IT'S GOOD. BUT\nWHAT I SAID FROM THE WELL AND\nWHAT I'LL SAY HERE IS THAT I\nAPPRECIATE BEING ABLE TO PROTECT\nTHESE VICTIMS, BUT I DON'T\nUNDERSTAND WHY WE ARE JUST\nPICKING THIS CERTAIN CLASS OF\nVICTIMS TO PROTECT. TO ME, IT'S\nAN ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT THE LAW\nGOES TOO FAR, THAT IT HURTS\nVICTIMS. AND IF WE'RE GOING TO\nCARVE OUT VICTIMS OF SEX\nTRAFFICKING TO MAKE SURE THAT\nTHEIR CLAIMS CAN STILL GO\nTHROUGH. WHAT ABOUT VICTIMS OF\nSEXUAL ASSAULT? WHAT ABOUT\nVICTIMS OF RAPE IN A STAIRWELL?\nWHAT ABOUT OTHER CRIME? VICTIMS\nOF MURDERS AND BEATINGS AND\nSTABBINGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT?\nI REALLY WISH THAT WE COULD HAVE\nSLOWED DOWN AND HELPED ALL THOSE\nVICTIMS.\n>> YEAH. I WANT TO GET INTO\nSOMETHING ELSE YOU TALKED ABOUT\nIN TERMS OF TORT REFORM FORM, A\nLOT OF WHAT WE'VE HEARD WITH\nTORT REFORM HAS TO DO WITH\nINSURANCE REFORM, THAT IT'S\nNEEDED AND IT IS LIKELY TO COME\nUP NEXT YEAR. WE KEEP HEARING\nTHAT YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT WILL\nHAPPEN.\n>> I HOPE IT HAPPENS. HOPE\nSPRINGS ETERNAL. I SPEAKER BURNS\nANNOUNCED THAT TODAY. I HAD NOT\nHEARD OF THAT UNTIL TODAY. BUT\nHERE'S MY QUESTION FOR THE\nSPEAKER AND OTHERS AT HOME. IF\nWE WERE SO CERTAIN THAT PREMIUMS\nWERE RISING BECAUSE OF LAWSUITS\nAND THAT WAS CREATING THIS\nINSURANCE CRISIS WHY DO WE NEED\nAN INSURANCE STUDY TO FIND OUT\nWHETHER THAT'S TRUE OR NOT? IT\nSEEMS LIKE WE SHOULD HAVE DONE\nTHAT FIRST, INSTEAD OF DOING\nTHIS WHOLESALE REWRITE OF OUR\nCIVIL PRACTICE ACT. IT SEEMS\nLIKE WE PUT THE CART BEFORE THE\nHORSE BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE IF\nWE DO AN HONEST STUDY OF\nINSURANCE REFORM, WE MAY FIND\nOUT THAT INSURERS WERE NOT BEING\nAS TRUTHFUL TO US AS WE HAD\nHOPED THEY WOULD BE. IN TELLING\nUS WHY PREMIUMS WERE RISING.\nTHAT'S SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED\nIN FLORIDA. AND THE SPEAKER OF\nTHE HOUSE HAS HAS CALLED FOR AN\nINVESTIGATION AND SAYS WE GOT\nDUPED. BASICALLY, THEY CAME TO\nUS AND SAID THERE WAS THIS\nCRISIS. AND IF WE DIDN'T DO\nLAWSUIT REFORM, THEN ALL THE\nINSURERS WERE GOING TO HAVE TO\nLEAVE THE STATE BECAUSE THEY\nWERE LOSING MONEY. SO THEY\nSTOPPED AND DID AN\nINVESTIGATION. WE DECIDED TO\nFOLLOW THEIR LEAD AND ALSO DO\nLAWSUIT REFORM, BELIEVING THE\nINSURERS THAT WE HAD THIS\nCRISIS. AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO\nFIND OUT IF IT'S TRUE OR NOT.\nTHAT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO\nME.\n>> NOW, I KNOW YOU DID NOT VOTE\nFOR IT. IT WAS A CLOSE VOTE. DID\nIT SURPRISE YOU HOW CLOSE IT\nWAS?\n>> NO. I KNEW IT WOULD BE CLOSE.\nIT DID SURPRISE ME THAT IT\nPASSED. I THOUGHT I THOUGHT WE\nHAD THE VOTES TO TO BEAT IT, AND\nTHAT WAS DISAPPOINTING. I'M\nDISAPPOINTED FOR GEORGIA AND\nTHOSE THAT NEED ACCESS TO THE\nCOURTS. AND HONESTLY, I'M. I'M\nFEELING A LITTLE BAD FOR OUR\nJUDGES RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THEY'RE\nGOING TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A\nMESS ON, ON THEIR HANDS TRYING\nTO FIGURE OUT ALL THE CHANGES\nTHAT WE'VE JUST DONE AND THAT\nARE GOING TO GO INTO EFFECT\nIMMEDIATELY UPON THE GOVERNOR'S\nSIGNATURE. THAT'S VERY\nDIFFERENT. THEY USUALLY DON'T\nGO INTO EFFECT RIGHT AWAY.\n>> OKAY. WELL, THANKS SO MUCH\nFOR COMING. THAT DOES IT FOR\nTODAY FOR LAWMAKERS. THANK YOU\nSO MUCH FOR JOINING US. WE'LL\nSEE YOU NEXT TUESDAY. BYE BYE.",
