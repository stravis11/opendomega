  "transcript": "Governor Brian Kemp kicked off the final\nday of the legislative session by\nsigning Senate Bill 36 into law,\nensuring that once again at the state\nlevel that Georgians are protected,\nincluding Georgians of faith. And I\nwanted to let everybody know that\ndespite signing that legislation,\nGeorgia still remains a state that is a\nstate that there's no place for hate.\nAnd I can assure all Georgians of that\ntoday.
