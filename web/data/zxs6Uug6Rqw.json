  "transcript": "They are convening having arrived. All members of this House will please report to their assigned seats. All members of the House will please report to their seats. The clerk will ring the bell. All members of the House will please report to their seats. We're going to have the morning roll call.

If so, the clerk will lock the machines. Doorkeepers will please close the doors and keep them closed. Good morning. Hope everybody is in a great mood today. What a beautiful day out there, huh? Sun shining. We will begin our day today with scripture reading and prayer by the chapel and after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chapel in this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 149th House District Representative Robert Pruitt, representative Pruitt. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and good morning, friends. I come to you this morning and I'm privileged to introduce you my pastor, pastor Darrell Summy. Darrell is a native originally from Panama City Beach, Florida. He's been with the first Baptist Church Eastman with us for a little over 20 years now. But Darrell's wife, Leanne, they're with us outside there and his seven children are at home. But Darrell is a special kind of preacher. He still preaches that teaches the gospel that you and I know. But he's a little bit different from the standpoint of his target audience. So he has been faithful to the ministry of youth. So I've yet to hear anybody introduce a youth pastor here. So I bring to you a little bit different flavor of a pastor and he has done an amazing job with our youth in Dodge County. Well attended groups and has been a great faithful following from that. So without any ado, I'd like to introduce you to and welcome, please, Pastor Darrell Summy. Well, good morning. I want to begin by expressing deep gratitude to Speaker David Walston for the invitation to be here this morning and to my representative from District 149 Robert Pruitt for extending such a gracious welcome to me and to my family. It is truly an honor to stand before you here in this place on this day. I tell you the truth, I never thought I would have an opportunity like this in my life. And so thank you so much for that. Please accept greetings and well wishes from the good people of Dodge County, Georgia. And please accept the same from my brothers and sisters, the family of faith at Eastman First Bab Disturge. And although I was originally born in North Carolina and raised in Panama, I said before that I've lived in Georgia longer than anywhere else and Georgia has become my home and I am proud to say that. Thank you for each of you, for your service to the people of Georgia. Please know that I am praying that God would bless you, my lady, as you lead this great state. You know success in life often requires going through a certain process. That's true when it comes to filling out your taxes. That's true if you're defusing a bomb. That's true if you're raising children or building a house. It's true if you're baking your grandmother's cookies. You better follow her recipe especially if she's going to eat them. I'd like to share with you today from first Chronicles 28 because I believe success in this life requires following the correct process as well. And we're going to pick up in this narrative where Solomon is having his inauguration day. David is old, he's not going to be around much longer and he is passing the reins on to King Solomon. King Solomon was going to take the reins that day. And David knew this was going to be a hard task. It was going to be a difficult task for this young man to fulfill. And so he wanted to pass along some last minute truths, some words of wisdom that would help him to be a success. And I am convinced that the instructions he gives Solomon would benefit each and every one of us. They are foundational for success in politics, for success in ministry, for success in life, whatever arena you find yourself. And so let me read from first Chronicles chapter 28 verse 9 and 10. Scripture says this, as for you, my son Solomon, know the God of your father and serve him with a whole heart and a willing mind for the Lord searches all hearts and understands every intent of the thoughts. If you seek him, he will let you find him. But if you forsake him, he will reject you forever. Consider now for the Lord has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary, be courageous and act. Father, I thank you that your word is truth and you have given us your word that we might not just have information but we might have transformation. And so I pray now that you would give me grace to preach, give us grace to hear and give us grace to apply these words to our lives and Jesus, name my prayer. So what is this process for success that we can find in these scriptures? Number one is to fully know God. King David said, know the God of your father. David wanted Solomon to know God. He didn't want Solomon to simply know about him. He wanted Solomon to know him personally, deeply, truly. You can almost hear David saying, son, I want you to know my Jehovah God, the one who has been my shepherd, the one who has given me victory in battle, the one who has forgiven me and cleansed me of my sins. This God whom I have known, he can be known by you too. And that's what I want for you son. David knew that the task ahead was going to be way too much for Solomon to handle on his own. Solomon would need the Lord. You know what? The truth of the matter is we're the same way. All of us need the Lord. None of us were designed to live our lives apart from him. God created each and every one of us with the express purpose of knowing and being known by him. And even though our sins have cut us off from God, he made a way for us to be made right with him. The Scriptures teach that Jesus came and paid the price for our sins. He came, the God man who took on flesh. He lived the perfect life that you and I could not live. He died the sacrificial death that you and I deserve. And he rose again victorious over sin and death so that we can have a right relationship with God. First Peter 3 verse 18 says, for Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous that he might bring us to God. We had no way of getting to God on our own. The Scriptures teach, the bad news of Scripture, is that there's nothing we can do to change the fact that we are separate from God because of our sins. But the Scriptures also teach the good news is that it's not about what we do. It's about what Christ is already done. As David did with Solomon, I plead with you. If you do not already know the Lord, get to know him. Don't settle for just knowing about him. Know him personally and intimately through Jesus Christ the Lord. There's nothing more important. David knew that until Solomon got that right, he wouldn't get anything else. Right. And the same is true for us. You know in baseball, it doesn't matter how far you hit the ball, it doesn't matter how fast you run or how well you slide, or even how pretty you look doing any of it. If you don't touch first base, none of the rest of it counts. And the same is true with knowing God. That's first base in life. Until you've done that, nothing else matters. You're not going to make it home and you're not going to win without knowing him. So that's the first thing we need to know God. Number two, David says, you know what? Serve God faithfully. David tells him, serve him with a whole heart and a willing mind for the Lord searches all hearts and understands every intent of the thoughts. David didn't just want his son to know God. He wanted Solomon to put him first and to serve him faithfully. Did you notice that David doesn't tell his son to serve the people? Well, why not? Shouldn't he do that as a leader? Yes, of course. But David knew that the best way for Solomon to serve the people well was for him to serve God with a whole heart. And the same is true with you. If you will serve the Lord with all your heart, you can guarantee that you will serve your constituents well. David also tells him how to serve the Lord. He says to serve him with a whole heart. You know, we are often guilty of giving half-hearted treatment, half-hearted effort to some of the things we do in life. However, God deserves and God expects nothing less than our whole heart. There should be no aspects of our lives that aren't surrendered to the Lordship of Jesus Christ. He is either Lord of all, who he is not Lord at all. We must remember too that we can't fool God. We can't put on a mask. We can't do, go through the motions and fool God. Because God doesn't look at the outward appearance. He looks at the heart. He knows our every deed, our every word, our every thought, our every motive. You can't pull the wool over his eyes to make sure you serve the Lord with a whole heart. Number three, seek the Lord fiercely. David says if you seek him, he will let you find him. Know him, yes, serve him, yes. But don't stop there. Keep seeking more of him. We should seek to see him more clearly, to love him more dearly, to follow him more nearly every single day. You know, some things in this life are so good that you just can't get enough of him. Whether it's donuts, a football, or laughter, or vacations to the Bahamas, or barbecue, hallelujah, whatever it is, there's things that we just have an insatiable appetite for. So let me ask you, how can we settle for just some of God, for just a little bit of Jesus? He is so amazing, so wonderful, so delightful. He is our treasure so that we should never be satisfied with what we already have of him. We should always want more. We should constantly hunger to know him and follow him more and more and more. The good news is that when you seek him, truly seek him, you will be rewarded. You will find him. And when you find him, you'll find everything you need for this life. Don't stop seeking him. And finally, David tells him obey God fiercely. Verse 10, David continues by saying, consider now for the Lord has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary. Be courageous and act. God had great plans for Solomon. He had personally chosen Solomon to build his temple. Can you imagine being chosen as the one to build a house for God? What a great honor. But it was also a formidable undertaking. How was this young rookie of a king going to succeed at such an incredible job by simple obedience? See in the next verses that we didn't read, we see that David gave Solomon the plans for the temple, the plans that God had given to David. And by simply following God's words, step by step, Solomon could not fail. You know what? We've been given plans by God too. In the Bible, we have the very blue plants for life. Second Timothy 3, 16 and 17, all scripture is inspired or breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for approval, for correction, for training and righteousness that the man of God might be thoroughly equipped for every good work. He hasn't left us to try to figure out life on our own. We can be equipped for success by simply living life according to his work. God desires to accomplish significant things through each of us. It might not be leading a country, but he wants to accomplish great, eternal kingdom things through each and every one of us. And so whatever he calls you to do, be courageous and act and act, step out in obedience without hesitation, without compromise and see what great things he will accomplish through you. David knew that Solomon did these four things. Solomon and the whole nation of Israel would be just fine. Knowing God fully, serving God faithfully, seeking God fiercely and obeying God fearlessly, that's our recipe for success as well. Let us pray together. Heavenly Father, I come to you with praise and honor and thanksgiving, I praise you for being the only true God, for being our creator, for being our sustainer, I praise you for being holy and righteous in all your ways. Thank you so much, Father, for saving my soul. I thank you for making yourself known for me to me. I thank you for rescuing me from myself, for transforming my life from the inside out. And I pray, Father, that you would forgive us for our sins both individually and corporately. I pray that your kindness would lead us to repentance and that you would heal our hearts, our homes, and heal our land. I thank you, Father, for this great state, for this great nation and the freedoms that we have as a people. I thank you for the men and women who stand before me today and the work that they do to represent the people of Georgia. I pray for these representatives, Father. I pray that you would draw each of them to know you personally through Jesus Christ our Lord. I pray that you would grant them wisdom from on high, that they might be able to discern what is good and right and best as they lead our state. Your Word says that righteousness exalts a nation, so I pray that they would walk in righteousness so that they might lead us down that good path. I pray that your Holy Spirit would guide them into all truth that they would abhor what is evil and that they would cling to what is good. I thank you for your Holy Word and I pray that we would know it. And I pray that these gentlemen and ladies would know it so that they might serve as a lamp unto their feet and a light unto their path. I pray that you would guard and protect them, especially from the evil one who seeks to steal and kill and destroy in our lives and in our society. Bless this, Father, bless them with your provision, with your protection and most of all your presence. May they know you, serve you, seek you and obey you so that they might have true success in this task that you have appointed them to. May your kingdom come, Father, and you will be done on earth in the United States of America, in the state of Georgia, in this legislative body and in our lives, even as it's always done in heaven. Be honored and be glorified in us. I pray in the name above all names, the name of Jesus Christ the Lord in them. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Thank you.

Colleagues, we rise today to announce the passing in honor of the life of Henry County Commissioner Gary Barham. He was hospitalized from much of February because of complications from COVID-19 and died yesterday morning to Tuesday, March 2nd. A native of Henry County Commissioner Barham grew up in McDonough and attended Henry County High School and Griffin Tech. He had served district three on the commission since 2013 and prior to that spent 31 years with the city of McDonough, including a stint as a city's director of public works. He served as a volunteer firefighter, was on the committee for the Olympic Torch Relay and the Paralympics Torch Relay. He served as president of the Kiwanis Club and was a member of first families of Henry County, the Henry County Moose Lodge, delivered from Meals Own Wheels and helped bring the first Veterans Day program to the McDonough Square. Commissioner Barham was also heavily involved in sports, playing baseball himself and coaching Little League, Youth Baseball, Basketball, and Football. He unpowered the first Roberto Clemente World Series held in McDonough and was later inducted into the Henry County Recreation Hall of Fame. He married for 34 years to his wife Becky, a pair of two sons, Josh and Adam, and five grandchildren. Gary was a great man and friend and a true public servant. I ask that you join me in a moment of silence to honor his memory. Thank you. Chair recognizes for a morning order the dean of this House of Representatives, Dean Summary. Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, a House, when I got to call that Vernon Jordan had passed, it was a very, very difficult moment for me and for a lot of people in America. When I chair at the Columbus Urban League, Vernon Jordan was the executive director of the National Urban League and he has been an inspiration to so, so many people. And I just want to come. We just want to come this morning. He's a native Georgian. He's a person that has been involved in a lot of civil rights activities throughout his lifetime. He was a tremendous business executive with a lot of major corporations in America. President sought him out for advice. He was an advisor to every president since Lyndon Johnson and he worked very, very closely with Bill Clinton and Barack Obama and President, both of the Bush's presidents, and Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter. He was just a tremendous, he was a giant of a person. He was absolutely. And when you got him, it was always a joy. He was always amicable. He was just a person that always wanted to share and always wanted to lift up other people up. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for giving us this time this morning to acknowledge a great Georgian of Vernon Jordan. If we take a pause for a moment to celebrate his life. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and ladies and gentlemen, the House. Chair recognizes representative Stephen Meeks for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Monday, March 8, would have been Amriss Bedford's 11th birthday. Two years after Amriss was diagnosed, a two years of age, Amriss was diagnosed with a rare aggressive form of brain cancer. One of life this precious child lived in her short time here on this Earth. She was an amazing little girl who brightened the room and encouraged everyone else, even while she was fighting her own battle. Her family stood steadfast, an example to me, and to all of us in the way that we should carry ourselves throughout these kinds of journeys. You see, they know that this old world is not our eternal home, and now Amriss is healed, whole, and eternally happy at home with Jesus. Please join me in a moment of silence for Amriss's family, and please pray for her family in the days to come. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, all you're the well. Chair recognizes Representative Gloria Frazier for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Tomorrow is a committee day, but it's also be the match day here in Atlanta. More than 400 Georgians, patients, turned to be the match, searching for a cure last year. For patients battling deadly blood cancers like leukemia and lymphoma, or life threatening blood diseases like sickle cell disease, A-plastic anemia, there is a cure. So many people do not realize that their blood stem cells could hold the cure for a patient battling these diseases. Please join Senator Tanya Anderson and myself on tomorrow Thursday, March 4th, on 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. over in Liberty Plaza as we commemorate March 4th as be the match day. I encourage all of you to come and listen to donors who have had the cure from citizens like you and I who have donated their stem cells. Tomorrow from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. in Liberty Plaza, and you will also be able to witness actually a person swapping to join the registry. Chick-fil-A lunch will be served, and I'll see you there. Thank you. Time for morning orders has expired. Those who were not reached, if they wish to sign up for tomorrow, may do so with a messenger. All right, we're going on now to the rules calendar. Going on to the rules calendar. What purpose does Chairman Stevens rise? To make a motion. State your motion. I'd like to move that the substitute to House Bill 86 go back to the rules committee for a little fine tuning. Clerk will read the caption. House Bill 86, by representative Stevens, 164th and others to be entitled back to men. Chapter 27 of Title 50, the fish put a Georgia annotator relating the lottery for education, so it's required for the lottery game of sports wagering in this state. On the motion of Chairman Stevens that House Bill 86 be recommitted to the rules committee, is their objection? Chair, here's none, and it is so ordered. What purpose does the Chairman of the Rules Committee rise? Let's speak, or make a motion. State your motion. I move the House Bill 675 be recommitted to the Rules Committee. Clerk will read the caption. House Bill 675, by representative Cantrell of the 20-second to be entitled back to amend. Code section 2818, in article 1 of chapter 7 of Title 45.

Clerk will read the caption to House Resolution 185. House Resolution 185, by representative Ralston, the seventh and others, a resolution reauthorizing the House Rural Development Council. This bill, this resolution, I have been referred to the Committee on Economic Development and Tourism. That committee recommends that this resolution be adopted. Chair recognizes Chairman Sam Watson to present the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I just want to first say what an honor it is to carry this bill on your behalf and how great it has been to be a part of an idea and a concept that you developed and that you came up with to start with something so small, but yet create such a large ripple effect across this great state in this Rural Development Council. And for those of you that are not aware, four years ago, the Speaker charged this body in the Rural Development Council.\n\nto go out and implore the motto of this great colony of Georgia when it was established in 1733 by our trustees and General James Orgothorpe. And that is not for yourself but for others. And that's what this council has done. If you remember we've had major broadband expansions and growth in the broadband areas. We've had huge issues in healthcare. We've had tremendous conversations around education. And those all stand from the Royal Development Council as it may be across the state. And even some small things with just us going out into our communities and hearing from the locals and hearing about their problems. Sometimes it was just us coming back here making some phone calls. And we were able to get a lot of things accomplished for rural Georgia. But we still got a lot of challenges and we still got a lot of things we need to do to move this state forward. And I hope that you will agree to allow us to renew this council for another two years. And Mr. Speaker just thank you for all of your efforts and the work that you put toward this. And look forward to serving on this council again. And I'll be glad to take any questions. You do not have any questions. Thank you. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair hears none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution? The chair hears none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this resolution now be adopted? All those in favor of the adoption of the resolution will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Understood? Have all Members voted? have all members now voted? Yes so the clerk will lock the machines on the adoption of House Resolution 185. The eyes are 164, the nays are zero. This resolution having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 593. House Bill 593 by reps of black men in the 146 to be titled an act to men are due Chapter 7 and Title 48. The official go to George Ante, who relate in the imposition rate computation and exemptions from state income taxes. This bill I refer to the committee on ways and means that committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee chairman blackman to present the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker. We bring before you House Bill 593, which would raise the standard deduction on singles from 4600 to 5400 and married to from 6,071. So a modest measured increase gives George and some tax relief and affects the most number of George and allows them to keep some of their own money. Mr. Speaker, I'd be happy to answer any questions but that is generally what the bill does. You have a couple of questions if you care to yield. Yes sir, be happy to yield. Chair recognizes the minority caucus leader leader Beverly to your left. Thank you Mr. Speaker. It is gentleman you. Yes sir. Is there a fiscal note associated with this bill? Yes sir. It's in the $140 million range. Thank you very much. Yes sir. Do you further yield? Yes sir. Chair recognizes representative Carpenter Do you write for a question? Does the gentleman yield? Yes sir, do. Is this hopefully a first step in reducing taxes for all Georgians? Well, it certainly reduces taxes for majority of Georgians all working Georgians and I think it's a modest first step. Yes sir, in the right direction. Thank you. I appreciate you bringing this measure. Thank you. Take one more, Mr. Speaker, if there is one. Chair recognizes Chairman Martin to your left for a question. Chairman Blum, you'll for question. Yes sir. Isn't it true one of the things that this bill does is provide this for the standard deduction? Isn't it true because of the federal change a couple of years ago more Georgians are filing for the standard deduction because they increased standard deduction at the federal level. And this will given that change a few years ago at the federal level and this change today it will affect the most Georgians possible and that $140 million will be scattered over a wide path across Georgia. Yes sir, if I understand you, Chris, question correctly that does move us in the right direction, Chairman Martin. Thank you for the question. Mr. Speaker, if there are any further questions, will you have some, but you know it's up to you. I'll answer one more if there's. Chair recognizes the minority caucus will represent it to Wilkerson to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman yield? Yes sir, to the web. You had mentioned working families, isn't that true? That this benefits those that do not itemize. So we would go to working families, that correct? Yeah, that correct. It is for just those that take the standard deduction. Yes sir. If there, I think Mr. Speaker, we've talked about this probably a good bit. I would certainly think this is good for Georgia and appreciate the opportunity as for the body's favorable consideration yield the well. Gentlemen has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill. The chair here is none. The report of the committee has agreed to shall this bill now pass. All those in favor of the passage of House Bill 593 will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 593. The eyes are 171. The nays are zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 587. House Bill 587, my representant Williamson, the 115th and others. Meantime to amend title 48, the physical of Georgia, and tentative related to revenue and taxation. So it's to provide for a tax credit for medical equipment and supply manufacturers and pharmaceutical and medicine manufacturers. This bill I refer to the committee on ways and means. That committee recommends this bill do pass by rules committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative Williamson to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Fellow members, I bring for you today for your consideration House Bill 587 LC43197. Zero S by committee substitute. This bill is known as the Georgia Economic Renewal Act of 2021. It's basically a week of binding five different bills into one bill with intention of not only being able to discuss this and being able to tell our constituents. This is a major package of business job incentive tools that we can all go home and be proud of. But so bear with me I'm going to try to walk you fairly quickly through the moving parts of this bill. Section two of the bill establishes a new tax credit for medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturers, which will be available for new qualified jobs created on around July 1st, 2021. It's the intent of this legislation to try to not only grow our pharmaceutical manufacturer in Georgia, but also grow medical device manufacturing as well. Importantly, taxpayers can take either the PPP, the personal protection equipment credit or the medical advice of pharmaceutical manufacturers' tax credit but not both. Section two, three of the bill allows the existing Georgia Port Activity Credit to be used against income or withholding taxes at 100%. Most of you know that Georgia's tax code does not tax the income on manufacturing goods from Georgia that are sold out of the state or out of the country. So thereby we've got a lot of people that have grown jobs, maximize the use of the income tax credits against their state income already. This will allow them to flexibility use these earned income tax credits which are always already accounted for from a fiscal standpoint against their payroll with holding taxes. Section two, four removes the 4500 job cap on the mega project tax credit for qualified projects and quite frankly, the more I studied that, I could never figure out why we had a cap of 4500 jobs on the kind of high paying jobs with benefits that we were trying to attract to Georgia. So this just removes that cap because we want all the high, good high paying jobs we can get in the state of Georgia. Furthermore, the new zone that establishes that this is important for all Georgians, the high impact aerospace defense project criteria, which include the investment tax credit with the bear women we get from the minutes here. It actually defines the qualifications to be recognized as the high impact arrow dispense project, which is going to allow the manufacturing investment tax credit to be coupled with either the mega tax credit program or the quality jobs tax credit program but not both. The manufacturing tax credit program requires a minimum of 1,800 jobs and 1,800 million dollars investment and it does have a cap on the credit of $100 million. Importantly, this project is a major importance for the next generation programs in Georgia for our aerospace industry and think next generation fighter jets, hypersonic aircraft, scum works programs such as that to recruit these kind of jobs to Georgia and grow it. And again, we expect the generational impacts should this project come to fruition. Part three of the bill simply re-ups the Georgia Aggrabices and Rule Jobs Act. It re-ups it for another $100 million as program hasments particularly successful for rule Georgia. The numbers in the bill say $100 million but I will remind the body that it's actually only $60 million in state treasury and it's only the third year that the state starts paying out and it's limited to $15 million a year or a four year period. And finally, and importantly, section four is going to extend the sunset on the very successful short line rail maintenance tax credit program that was authored and carried by Representative Patty Bentley a few years ago. I describe that short line railroads as being the fingers going to our class one railroads and these fingers extend into towns that would not otherwise have railroad access and that means most of rule Georgia and towns all across Georgia. So with that overview of the program, Mr. Speaker, I'd be happy to answer any questions and you don't want to remind the body that this is a bipartisan bill and be happy to answer any questions. Thank you, you know, for questions. Yes, sir. Chair recognizes Representative Bentley to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? They might honor. This is a serious question. Although you referenced my legislation back in 2018, I wanted to for the sake of our new members. Is it not true that back in 2018, the General Assembly session that I authored House Bill 735, which was a part of the rule Georgia Development Council's agenda for class three railroads? That is true. You did a great job. And it's not further true that the late Jay Powell assist in representing to Jay Powell assist and drafting up that legislation. He did a marvelous job and I think he was the best ways he means chairman we ever had, but the others following him were pretty good too. But thank you for your assistance on this measure. And thank you for your work on this bill. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the will and ask for the body's favorable consideration. Gentlemen, as yielded the will, Chair recognizes Representative Reeves to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Folks, I want to talk real briefly about the Defense Aviation Project piece. And that's something that some, myself and some of my Cobb County delegation members and chairman Belton and others have been working on for some time. And it was filed as a separate bill in House Bill 41. And we're very fortunate and happy that it was put into this piece of legislation that Chairman Williamson is carrying. But folks, this is really a generational opportunity. The military is going to be rolling out three aviation projects in the next three years. And that is going to represent the next generation of military aviation for the entire country. And Georgia has an opportunity to be the epicenter of military aviation defense with this. Georgia has a historic role in this as a Lockheed Martin, as probably everyone in this room is aware, been involved with aviation projects for our military for a very long time and have produced C-130, F-22, and many others. A lot of those have been phased out. And there is capacity at Lockheed Martin. They're turn key ready right now to be able to take on these projects. Now, this option would be available for anybody that's capable of bidding and capable of taking on these projects. But I will say that I believe Lockheed will certainly bid whether it's Lockheed or a competitor. If we can land these contracts at Georgia, then this is a game changer. And again, we can become the epicenter of the future of aviation. It's literally thousands of engineering jobs come with these. And I know you all get tired of hearing me talk about Georgia Tech, but my gosh, we've got aerospace, mechanical, electrical, industrial engineers that we are putting out that would love the opportunity to go work on projects like these. But they're going to Washington State, the work at Boeing, and they're going to California. Let's keep them here in Georgia. Let's keep our talent here. This is generational opportunities. I ask you to please support this bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen, is yielding the oil? Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair hears none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to withdrawing the committee substitute? Is any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules? The chair hears none. The rules committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair hears none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does representative Anola Witt's rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Thank you, sir. Is it not true that the district I represent that is home not just to our Atlanta graves, but to Lockheed in the Georgia National Guard. But the aerospace defense industry there is home to nearly 5,000 jobs, most of whom are members of IAM Local 709, and that this bill could mean security not just for those high paying defense jobs, but could ultimately mean more than 3,000 additional jobs and additional $1.7 billion in investment in Metro Atlanta, and would absolutely help maintain the critical importance of Dobbins's home, not just to Lockheed, but to the Georgia National Guard and the Georgia Tech Research Facility there. The lady said a lot in that parliamentary inquiry. However, the chair believes her to be accurate in everything that was stated. We'll do one more. Chair recognizes representative Smith in room 331 for what purpose does he rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Speaker, isn't it true that the gentleman from the 18th's father is a 34-year-plus employee of Lockheed Martin and that the effects of this act will far surpass just Cobb County, but has far reaching effects in the other states as well? Absolutely. I know that to be true. I'll go over Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Lee. Have all members now voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 157. The eyes are 157. The nays are 14. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 586. House Bill 586, by the way, wants to the 170 second and others to be entitled back to a men part one of Article 1848. The fiscal to Georgia and Tate relating the general provisions regarding sales and use taxes so as to extend the sunset date with the exception for projects of regional significance. This bill ever referred to the committee on ways and means that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Watson to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I do bring before you members of the House HB 586. This is also another great bill that will literally call some ripple effects across our great state. But it's better known as the Georgia Economic Recovery Act of 2021. I'm just going to walk through it real quick, but starting in section 2, basically what we're doing there is we're extending the sunset on the sales tax exemption on materials used during construction projects of regional significance. This is a declaration that's made by our state to be an added tool in the toolbox to bring major projects to our state. It's only been used nine times since 2012. So, it's not used unless it is very necessary and is secured over 8700 jobs in our state. And it's a great tool to have in the toolbox when it comes time to bring jobs to our state. And we're just extending the sunset there so we can continue to have that tool in the toolbox. Article 3 is a sales tax exemption on the performing arts venues across our state. Obviously, due to COVID, many of our performing arts, opera, symphony, poetry, dancing, many of us have these in our communities and they're very important to the quality of life. And so they've been really hit hard by COVID. And so we're just trying to have something that they can use in their communities as a very short term tax exemption. If you'll see the sunset is December 31st, 2022. So we're just going to work with them on this and hopefully it will be something that will help them long term to kind of fill in some holes from their loss of business due to COVID-19. Section 4, we are clarifying the definition of what a manufacturing plant is. We've already passed this bill previously in this house dealing with our concrete trucks that are basically manufacturing plants that move. And so we're defining it and clarifying it for a DOR so that they know what these are. These are used in construction of economic development projects. It's been a great tool for them. These trucks still pay TABT. They still pay motor fuel taxes. They're heavy use fees. But they also generate sales tax revenue from the actual sale of concrete. So it's a very beneficial tool for them as they continue to build projects across our state. Final piece of this bill is dealing with renewing the sunset or removing the sunset. I'm sorry. On the sales tax exemption for boat parts that are retrofitted or repaired in our state. And this is big projects like half a million dollar type big yacht projects. Some of you may have some of those back home. I'm not sure but don't have those in my district. But we're doing this basically to provide some consistency and some long term benefit to the people that are in this business. Obviously we're wanting this to happen on the coast and we're wanting these big yachts to come to our state to be retrofitted and repaired. And so that's what this bill does and allows us to continue to do that and move forward with that economic development. Mr. Schmeger that's what the bill does and I'd be glad to take any questions and I would appreciate your support. You got a few questions if you care to yield. Yes sir. Chair recognizes the dean of the house being smiling to your left for a question. Gentlemen well do you yield? Yes sir. I mean I heard you talk about tax credits and it's a relates to the film. But do you recall we passed a bill that gave a half a million dollar tax exemption and tax credit to those of the former North Center that had reduction you know anything that they had that they would get a tax credit. On your recovery act does tell me a little again about the recovery part that you just mentioned. So this is just dealing with the sales tax on the sale of the tickets so that they can retain the local and state portion of the sales tax to go back to all of the money goes to the facility that's having the performing of our arts event and that's all we're doing in this bill. Strictly on sales tax instead of them remitting that money to the locals and to the state we want them to keep that money so they can put it in their pockets and hopefully help with their bottom line. And I'm not convinced of that because because during the pandemic like the theater we have in Columbus the performance of the it's shut down the springer which is to take state theater shut down. But when we passed that threshold bill of half a million dollars for production purposes the only theater that was able to benefit under that factor was the Fox theater. Those that are smaller theaters in performing arts centers when they have the production of 250,000 and 100,000 that they bring to their respective cities they don't get a tax credit for that. And we a lot of us are talking about lower net threshold because it's just the only person only performing center that is able to qualify is the Fox and I'm told one time the qualifier was when Hamilton came and it was more than a half a million dollars so but but I think what you're doing is it's going to be a great benefit to those theaters and performing arts centers because they are very important to the cultural aspect of all of our respective cities. So thank you very much. Yes sir. Thank you. Mr. Speaker if there's no further questions I'll yield the will. Billman has yielded the will. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute the chair here is none the committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill the chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage the bill will vote aye those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does representative Kenner dries parliamentary inquiry is it not true that HB 586 offers significant relief to our nonprofit community theaters that have been decimated by the pandemic and gives them a path forward to get back on their feet. I believe the gentleman is accurate in that statement. Have all members voted have all members voted. If so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 586 the eyes are 164 the nasor 6 this bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 363. House Bill 363. By rep's and the hood of the 175th to be titled an act to amend the official code of Georgia annotated relating crimes and offenses so as the revised definitions relative to the protection of elder persons this bill that refer to the committee on judiciary non-civil that committee recommends this bill do pass. There are recognizes representative of hood to present the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker and members of the House. House Bill 363 is about abuse of access. It's a type of exploitation against elder adults. And this bill is brought to me by the prosecuting attorney's counsel and became a priority as a result of a work group between prosecuting attorney's counsel also DCH, GBI and other departments. And the reason this bill is necessary is because when someone is charged and convicted of a crime involving abuse of access without this bill they can because of the rural lenity the court is sentencing people the lesser sentence. And so this bill will clean that up and make sure that we're tough on crime against elders. This bill went through three different judiciary hearings and pass unanimously every time. That's all I have Mr. Speaker. If there's any questions I'll be glad to take some. You do not appear to have any, well you do have a question to you. Yes sir. I recognize this representative Holly up in the gallery to your right for a question. Does the gentleman you? Yes. Is it not true that it's not true that it's for a simple assault that the person actually receiving the harm has to be a reasonable fear of their safety? I believe you know what you speak.\n\nBut if a measure is put forward through this house, which allows for folks to be able to visit their loved ones, will maybe diagnose with COVID-19 into a hospital setting that quite possibly they may be placing these doctors in a position of being victims of simple assault. When there is an intention to come into that area, one is already know that they could possibly harm them. Not aware of anyone that has that intention. Thank you, sir. Mr. Faker, I yield the well. If any further questions, gentlemen, as yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair hears none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair hears none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machines. On the passage of House Bill 363, the eyes are 171. The nasa zero, this bill having received, the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 248. House Bill 248, members and Apollo, 30 second and others to be entitled to enact to amend Code Section 40, 1418, the fiscal to Georgia, and the enforcement of speed limit in school zones with recorded images. This bill then referred to the committee on public safety and homeland security. The committee recommends that this bill do pass. There recognizes Chairman Powell to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The ladies and gentlemen of the House bring to you. You know, we always talk about a sample bill. Well, this is a pretty sample bill. It might not be the subject you like to deal with. This deal is with the school's own cameras with speed detection. Past a few years ago, we've been on a pretty successful project. Slowed a lot of people down in school zones. The criteria was always set when the bill was originally passed. One of the things it said was that the school that the schools themselves had to sign for the permit to the Department of Transportation. But there was a lot of y'all who hadn't been around here for a while to know whether it be radar or whether it be school cameras or any type of a camera. They have to be permitted by the Department of Transportation under certain criteria. Well, when that bill was passed, it said the schools had to sign for the permit to do the school cameras on in speed enforcement. And there's been some kind of problems. And for the life of me, I don't know what because it seems to be like it must be some money or something involved because if you're protecting children and making a safer environment for folks, then that ought to be what we're after to keep some of these children from getting around over. What this bill does, ladies and gentlemen, it says that the governing authority, whether it be a county or a city, the city police or the sheriff's department, then they can do the application for the permit from the GDOT. That's what it does. Moves it from the school to the law enforcement agencies that are enforcing this to start with. I would ask for your support. You can achieve the police and your sheriff's departments that they'd appreciate you also because they all stood up in favor of this. And that, Mr. Speaker, is what this bill is. And I would ask for your favorable consideration. Do you yield for questions? I will. Chair recognizes Representative Wolenski in room 341. Thank you, Speaker. Does the chairman yield? Yes, sir. Chairman, I, first of all, want to thank you for carrying this bill. The camera's getting to me. There I am. Thank you so much for carrying this bill. Is it not true? This bill is incredibly a great bill that's going to help cities and more importantly help the safety of children in our communities at all schools, whether it's elementary, middle school and high school. Well, since you put it bill does like it, I'm sure you would think so, and it is. Thank you, Chairman. Thanks for everything. Thank you. Mr. Speaker. Do you have another question or two, but it's up to you. Well, I don't see any argument. I'll be glad to answer questions because it's a pretty simple bill, but we can do it on a flavor of the point because somebody might be ready for lunch in a little while. Maybe a quick question. Chair recognizes Representative Jasmine Clark in the gallery. You're left for a question. Yes, ma'am. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. So in this bill, if we take the authority of the schools themselves to apply for the permit, could law enforcement potentially choose not to put cameras in a place where a school does want their to be cameras? Well, I guess they could, but hopefully in that situation, since the law enforcement or the ones that have to enforce it may have to scrutinize the tapes, hopefully they have a closer relationship between their school system and the law enforcement. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, I think that's pretty well the bill's self-explanatory. It has a good bill and it's something to help move these forward so we can protect these school children a little bit more. And I'll yield the well and ask for your favorable consideration. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 248. The eyes are 133. The nays are 35. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 334. House Bill 334, my resident of color, the 19th to be titled an act to amend Article 2 of Chapter 6 and Title 15 in Article 1 of Chapter 17 of Title 45. The official bill to join the annotated relating to clerks' spirit courts and general provisions regarding notaries public. This bill I'm referred to committee on judiciary that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative Gullet to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This bill has to do with remote online notarizations. It dropped a similar bill last year. It was House Bill 785. When you drop a bill related to notarizations, I'm an IT guy. I think it's an IT type of bill. But it turns out two years later that you learn that notarization is an integral part of numerous legal transactions. And that attorneys throughout the state all have very surprisingly strong opinions on the matter. Who would have guessed, I guess, probably, right? We've had hours and hours of video calls to hammer out the details in the language of this bill to make sure that we're doing the right things for Georgians. Our primary objectives was this. One, create a Ron system, Ron stands remote online notary. System that will work in practice with enough flexibility to adapt, but firm enough to firm, but enough firm rules in place to protect the integrity of the process. Under this bill, an online notarization will include security measures and record keeping that go far beyond what happens with paper notaries today. So not only will we get more convenience, but will get more security and better integrity with remote online notary. Number two, we wanted to do absolutely nothing that threatened the role of the attorney in conveying real estate in Georgia. You say that one more time? We wanted to do absolutely nothing to threaten the role of the attorney in conveying real estate in Georgia. The system has served our state well, and I'm pleased to say that we put language in this bill that strengthens closing attorneys from being threatened by unlicensed practice of law in Georgia. For the first time, our real estate closing attorneys and our citizens are getting an appropriate remedy to seek if consumers are damaged when nonlawyers illegally convey real estate and record documents here in Georgia. Number three, one of the build consensus among dozens of specific industries who are interested in this process and wanted to see them protected. For this new idea to work, we needed a strong buy-in from both the Superior Court Clerk's Authority, the court clerks will administer the system in the lawyers and businesses who will have the opportunity to use it. Number four, we wanted to make sure that we kept the system open to all Georgians from mom and pop notaries to giant corporations. Here again, we worked carefully to make sure this new tool is accessible to everyone while also building in safeguards that are needed to protect our consumers. I am pleased to report that this bill has achieved those goals. We have carefully thought out this bill, and it was a result of hours and hours of work to find middle ground and make good policy. It has support from the governor's office, banking and insurance communities, major business associations, the State Bar, Georgian, and many others. Georgia has a chance here to make a little legal history as we go, being the first attorney closing state to pass a consensus bill and give our citizens the ability to notarize documents without driving to a room and standing in front of a notary. This is convenient, smart, and in many ways much more secure and verifiable than an eak notary. Most importantly, we're going to solve a real world problem for folks that we represent. We won't have to stand in a room to perform a simple legal function or wander around town trying to find a notary. They can do this process from the comfort and safety of their own home or office, which is particularly important in times like we're in now. For our folks who need notarize something but suffer from age or disability or even don't want to get into a pandemic world, and this makes it hard for them to go places. Mr. Speaker, members of this body, I ask for your favorable consideration of this bill, and I will yield for any questions. Chair recognizes the vast chairman of the majority caucus representative gravely to your right for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Jim and you. I do. I am sure along with all these members, I greatly appreciate you reading the entire bill for us. No problem. Just before lunch, too, I might add. That sounds like a good plan. This is an important measure. I thought you wanted to know what was in the bill. The gentleman further you. Maybe I will. Is it not true that, and I've talked with the early on in this process that a lot of the lot of the individuals attorneys that frowned upon this process early on had to experience COVID and were some of the same individuals that came back to say, how can we help you on the bill because they saw the need for it. That's correct. Yeah, that's absolutely correct. That's a good bill. Thank you for bringing it. Thank you very much. Do you know for further questions? I'll do one more, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes representative Moore in the gallery to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does it, John Manu? I do for my friend. To follow on representative Graveli's comments, isn't it true that as a member of the legal community, I can attest that the vast majority of lawyers in this state have enjoyed the possibility of using remote online notary as a result of the governor's emergency order. And isn't it further true that Georgia is not unique in now moving to offer remote online notary, but is rather following other jurisdictions that have been using this practice for many years. Yes, you are absolutely correct. And you've spoken to me a number of times asking, where's this bill at and how can we move it forward? And I appreciate that support and your help with that. And I think it will be the 30th state to adopt remote online notary if this passes through the body and sign by the governor. Thank you for bringing this bill and being patient enough to propose it even prior to the pandemic. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Remember, the body asks for your favorable consideration. I yield the will. Gentlemen, as yielded the will, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair hears none.

This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. The clerk will read the caption to House Bill 355. House Bill 355, our representative, we'd hour the hundred and nineteen. The title of the act to amend Article 5 of Chapter 6 and the title 12, the fiscal to Georgia, and the Georgia carbon sequestration registry, so it's to provide for the inclusion of building products and construction on the registry. This bill never refer to the committee. Natural resources and environment that committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes representative wheat hour to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, today I bring to you House Bill 355. Nature is the living visible garment of God and this innovative measure will have Georgia leading the way on developing a voluntary market driven solution in addressing carbon offset and sequestration. This measure will expand Georgia's carbon registry to include an array of sustainable building products which will be verified and validated. The rigor of this process will have Georgia producing carbon credits and offset whose value will further incentivize innovation throughout our state. As the number one state for forestry in the union, this is not just a win for Georgia-grown products, but for all the Georgia businesses who choose to use materials that increase carbon sequestration and destruction. I'm excited to bring this legislation as it utilizes a private market solution that puts the state of Georgia at the forefront of this issue. I ask for your favourable consideration on this measure. Mr. Speaker, I'll yield for any questions. You have a few questions if you're here to yield. I yield. Chair recognizes Chairman Setslor to your right for a question. Mr. Jim and you. I do. Appreciate your quick run through. Could you give a little bit more detail on this? Forgive me. I've not studied this perhaps as I could have, but are there mandates in this about products? Sorry. There are no mandates in this whatsoever. What this does, it creates a commission that will review the carbon credits and how they're going to, if you'll turn, to me, the biggest portion of this is online 173174. When we establish a carbon baseline, additional evaluation, verification, permits and COVID-19, those six categories will produce a high-quality carbon credit that will be recognized on the global market to incentivize people and the state of Georgia to utilize these credits, but it will also benefit the Fortune 500 companies that are located in this state that choose to be involved in this process, as well as the little guy who wants to buy and utilize any of these products. Mr. Jim, would you further yield? I do. So, this allows our companies to participate in this program, which may be in other places, what I'm hearing you say. This is, as it's obviously talked about very much these days, being carbon neutral, delta being a purchaser of said credits as a perfect example. No one in the states currently has a program like this of this quality that would drive the market to be incentivized to be part of this, completely voluntary. So there's no, this isn't a cap and trade circumstance where there's caps that people would be, or help me understand what limitations folks would have that would incentivize them to participate in these credits. I'm just concerned there may be some caps to this and I'm not wrong about that. There's no caps, no sir. So what this does is it goes through and identifies construction building materials as what's being added to the carbon registry. So that might include carbon infuse concrete or actually studying and verifying and validating how much carbon is sequestered into a two by four.
