  "transcript": "All right ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for being here we'll call this meeting\nto order members of the subcommittee if you will follow along we will move quickly.\nWe'll start in section 24 24 dot 1 dot 3 through 24 dot 1 dot 9 this is our ag ed adds.\nstart with a number of items here. Number 24.1.3, we are not reducing those funds. 24.1.4.\nWe're annualizing the salary increase that was given. As you will see, this will impact\nabout 600 staff for a total of $94,000. 24.1.5. This is a $100,000 ad for 84 employees to\nto impact the per-member per month rate\non the health insurance increase.\n24.1.6, $110,000 to fund 10 new ag ed programs,\nwhich we do each year, 24.1.7 to add $100,000\nfor a young farmer position in Bibb County.\nAnd then 24.1.8 and .9 are adding program specific staff\nfor a total of about $400,000 there.\nYou'll turn it over to 24.3.4 to add\nhalf a million dollars for our STEM software,\nvia gamification program.\n24.5.2 a quarter million dollars to increase our\nsupport for communities and schools,\nwhich I think this committee has been very diligent,\nvery focused on supporting over the past.\nI do want to draw your attention to 24.6.4 this is a two and a half million dollar ad\nTo fund those PSAT and AP exams that that we have paid for\nWe seem tremendous growth in this as well as very high demand in in these two tests\nAnd so this is something that we're going to focus on funding in the base\nMoving forward, but we're talking about you know quite a few exams quite a few exams\nIf you'll flip over to 24.7 and curriculum development, you're going to see that we're\ngoing to make a number of transfers here in just a few minutes throughout this document\nas they relate to literacy and where we're putting those items.\nSo when I reference a number of transfers out, you will see them transferring in in a\nfew minutes.\n24.9.9.4. This is a formula true up 24.12. The literacy coach initiative. So this is the first place where you'll see dollars there from a literacy standpoint. This continues our focus on those resub based literacy coaches in our K5 system. This is adding 116 coaches bring that total to 116 coaches that 18.5 million dollars that you'll see there.\n24.3.7 is a formula true up 24.13.8 this continues Chairman Dickey our focus on\ncharacter education programming that we've seen great success across the\nstate with 24.13.9 is a formula true up 24.13.10 again this is a transfer as it\nrelates the universal reading screener which you'll see coming back in just a\nfew minutes. 24, 13, 11, this $150,000 ad for our feminine hygiene grants due to our inflation\nand increase in enrollments in those economically disadvantaged for those economically disadvantaged\nstudents and grades five through 12. Last year we passed Senate Bill 464, which called\nfor a $15 million infusion of cash to provide,\nstipend the $100 supply amount,\nstipend to each teacher.\nSo we're funding $7.5 million, our half there.\n2414.3 continued focus of this house\nand this committee as school nutrition,\nwe're simply adding hold harmless language there\nto continue and maintain the current funding.\nWe know that while the number of students\nneeding those meals may have gone down.\nAnybody has bought eggs lately or anything else for that matter.\nYou know the rising cost of meals has offset that.\n24.16.2.\nWe have a new federal bus driver training requirement and mandate.\nAnd this is the first year cost.\nHere if you'll see the $158,000 to pay for that for about 20,000 users across the state.\nthat cost will be cut in half next year.\nWe'll move quickly through a whole bunch of formula true ups.\nHere we go, 24-17-1, 24-18-1, 24-19-2, 24-19-3, 24-19-4,\nall formula true ups where you see different amounts.\nWe'll continue with 24.20.3.\nAnd then 24-22, our school nurses, this is that same calculation\nin comment that I made just a minute ago about school nutrition. We have a\nwhole harmless language there, even though there is a decline in elementary\nschool enrollment. 24.23.2, we're adding $150,000. This is an agency request to\nfund a position to oversee all of those school safety dollars, those safety\ngrants, that $109 million that's in the budget plus the infusion that the\ngovernor provided additional $50 million. That person who was overseeing that\nfunding was paid through a federal grant. Since that grant's ending we want to\nmake sure we have a dedicated person who can oversee a whole lot of a whole lot\nof dollars to make sure they go where they're supposed to. 24.23.3 this is a\n$25 million ad to focus on school safety. These are the start-up funds for the\nfirst year of the database ongoing funds for the BTAM teams, we've all voted on that bill\nand we know where those priorities are. 24.24.1, this is a $715,000 adjustment based on\nthe governor's recommendation. This is going by the House Bill 318 that was about charter\nschool commission compliance last year but specifically these new positions are to provide\nsupport to schools that are trying to become locally approved charter schools 24\n24 4 is a formula true up you'll go with me to 24.26 our student support\nservices these these are some pretty major investments that we as a\ncommittee and and we as a house are making here to further support our\nstudents the first 20 million dollar ad targets 20 thousand dollars per\nmiddle and per high school for 979 schools across the state to provide them\nwith a mental health provider whether that's their telehealth hiring in\nschool staff really concentrating on continuing our focus on mental health.\n24-26-2 to find an additional $5 million for social workers this is to target\nthose 75 schools that have no form of social workers so that we can put\nsomeone there, give them access, give those students access to much needed resources 24-26-3.\nThis is our, if any of you are familiar with the concept, the boost and the boost program\nand the reference to boost 2.0, this is a $10 million ad to continue to support our out\nof school and after school as I would say initiatives and then lastly in that same section\n24.26.4, 28 million dollar ad to create a poverty weight inside our QBE formula, we can talk\noffline about who is eligible and how that can be calculated. 24.27.1 is a formula true\nup. If you've been around the last couple of years, 24.27.6 will make a lot of sense\nto you where we've worked on those heavy equipment simulators. We've seen great success\nacross the state side note if y'all haven't been in one of those heavy equipment\nsimulators please contact me let me show you how to get in touch with those\nguys and go sit one of those simulators and see what we're teaching high school\nkids how to do it's it's pretty amazing it's pretty amazing you've never\nmoved dirt and filled up a dump truck this this is something you need to partake\nin for sure very happy to to support that 24.27.7 is just annualizing that\nraise. We have a new as as for leader Gamble knows and has been a great advocate for our Georgia\nCenter for Civic engagement. They finally became a career and tech student organization and so on\n24.27.8 program I'm very proud to support and they overseer youth assembly if anybody's been\nhere for that so we're adding $100,000 to that we will flip over to almost done 25.4.2 and ERS\nwe're simply adding $23 million to what's already in the base for a total of\n$50 million so that we can add an increase our one-time payment to our retirees\nand let's wrap up with our literacy initiatives. I guess we've got one quick\nitem before we get there. 27.10.3. Y'all are our PSE and our ethics\ninvestigators are handling 20,000 cases a year. They've gone the last nine years without\nhaving additional headcount staff, but that workload has increased 210%. So we're adding\ntwo full-time investigators for the 222,000 you see there. Another literacy transfer there,\nbut lastly, if you'll pull over to 27.14 in Gosa, you will see where we begin to add more\ndollars here for literacy for our coaches for our universal reading screener if you'll\nsee on 2714.3 this this coincidentally you know we did the blind I call it the blind tasting\nof the screeners that were available and this is the one that was chosen it's actually the lowest\ncost screener so great to know that it's the best and and the lowest cost 27.14.14 quarter\nmillion dollar ad for that literacy coach coordinator position and then we really want\nin 27.14.5 want to supplement what we're doing from a literacy standpoint with those\ncompetency-based research-based facts and figures and so you will see that there.\nThat's all I have or there are any questions from the committee here none wants a little\ncommittee. We have a motion to second any further discussion. You're going on all those\nin favor, please say aye. Any opposed, like, sign? Thank you. We stand adjourned.\n",
