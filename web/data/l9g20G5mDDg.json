Amon's three and three\nsays, how can we walk together, except we agree? So why should we make a difference, my fellow\nrepresentatives? Our world needs us. Our world depends on us. Our world would not survive\nif people did not help one another and we need each other to survive. Where would the\nworld be without good Samaritans. Secondly, why would we make a difference? We\nshould make a difference or we should be different makers because God expects\nthat of us because we're all God's children. So as we continuously move into\n2020 this first day, this session, as we go into day three of this session,\nrepresentatives, if we're going to make a difference in this house on a local\nlevel on a state level, on a national level. We got to accept the challenges that\ncome and make a difference and begin to move forward. Matthew 513 says, ye are the\nsalt of the earth, but the salt is lost in favor, where shall it be salted. People need\nto see a difference, a difference in our decisions, a difference in how we treat one another. Make\na difference, but not only make a difference, but learn to be the difference.\nFor first Corinthians 1538, it says, we must not resort to ungodly actions.\nBut as I get ready to leave you, I want to leave you with something.\nTwo things that I think will help us as we continuously move forward and make a difference.\nFellow representatives, we're going to make a difference, we got to move forward.\nWe must learn to evangelize our local community.\nWe must learn to evangelize our state community.\nAnd if we evangelize our local community, our state community,\nthen we can evangelize the world and make a difference.\nRepresentatives, if we're going to make a difference moving forward,\nwe got to develop future leaders.\nPaul invested himself in training Timothy,\nand Timothy was doing the same with other faithful men.\nLast last we began to make a difference, ultimately moving forward\nAnd to the future, it involves every member of this house.\nThe question I lead with you today,\nwill you accept the challenge to make a difference?\nWill we move forward?\nWhen do we make a difference?\nWe start today.\nWe start now.\nFor Philippians says, we can do all things\nthrough Christ, who strengthens us.\nJoin me as we began to go to the Lord in prayer.\nEternal God, our Father, we thank you now\nfor this day, God, we thank you for your grace\nand we thank you for your mercy.\nAs we come now, God, into this session, God,\nwe ask in that you touch everybody that's gathered,\ntouch every representative, God, touch every party,\ntouch the, I'll speak of the house right now, God.\nWe ask that you be with us in our decision making, God,\nthat we make wise decisions, God.\nHelp us to be able to move from the past Lord God but to more so focus on the future\nGod.\nHelp us to lay aside every weight that so easily beset us God.\nAs we go into another century, another decade God, help us to move forward as our people\nLord God.\nHelp us to move forward Lord God and make a difference in our community locally, nationally,\nregionally, and throughout the world.\nWe thank you, God, for just being so awesome and so wonderful.\nAnd then, God, we will not leave as you that you cover every speaker that's absent from\nthis place.\nBut we ask the special prayer for Representative Bob Tremor.\nWe thank you for it right now.\nIn Jesus' name, all of God's people said, Amen.\nI pledge to the flag of the United States of America and to the public for which His\none nation and the indivisible with liberty and justice for all.\nDoorkeepers will unlock the doors.\nYou\nYou\nYou\nThe Chair recognizes Chairman Hogan, the Chair of the Committee on Information and\nAudits.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nYour Committee on Information and Audits has read the journal of the previous legislative\nday and found it to be correct.\nWhen Hogan, the chair of the Committee on Information and Audits, reports that the journal\nof the previous legislative day has been read and found to be correct.\nIs there any objection to the confirmation of the journal?\nThe chair here is none and the journal is confirmed.\nThe clerk will read the resolution establishing the order of business for the day.\nMr. Burns, on the 59th of his following me establishes the order of business during the\nthe first part of the period unanimous consensus,\nintroduction to bills and resolutions,\nfirst reading and reference of House bills and resolutions,\nsecond reading of bills and resolutions,\nreports of standing committees,\nmourning orders.\nIs there any objection to the adoption\nof the resolution establishing\nthe order of business for the day.\nThe chair here's none, and the resolution is adopted.\nFirst reading of bills and resolutions, the clerk will read.\nHouse Bill 745 by Representative Thomas the 56th Cannon, 58th Shannon, and the 84th Kendrick\nof the 93rd and Stevenson of the 90th.\nBill being taught on the act of men chapter 2A in Title 31 of the physical to Georgia\nannotated relating the Department of Public Health.\nHealth and Human Services.\nHouse Bill 746 by Representative Kendrick of the 93rd, Scott of the 76th Cannon,\nthe 58 Thomas the 56 Shannon the 84th and others.

Happy New Year. Today is Patient Advocacy Day here at the\nGeorgia State Capitol. And for many years, I've had the honor of recognizing this group\nfor the outstanding work they do on behalf of Georgia Patients with their advocacy. Thank\nyou for all of those that are here in our gallery. And to all that are here at the Capitol\ntoday, they will probably be calling on you. I think them for their work. Patients should\nalways, patience should always be at the center of any legislation that we, as long makers,\nmake. As chairman of Health and Human Services, my goal is to protect our patients and to push\nfor healthcare systems to work for them, not for large corporations and organizations that\nhave their own self-interested heart.\nPatients in Georgia deserve better quality healthcare access.\nNo matter what their socioeconomic background is, the color of the scan are their zip code.\nThis year, we will be working to build upon laws like the Patient First Act and many\nothers to provide better health care outcomes for patients across our state.\nI look forward to working with all of you on these issues for better access to quality\nhealth care for all Georgians.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nI yield the well.\nChair recognizes representative Anulowicz for a morning order.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker and good morning.\nI am here today because it is cervical cancer awareness day in Georgia.\nWe have a group of advocates here, I think of some of you all in the gallery.\nI would love to welcome you to the Capitol today.\nWe are working with the Georgia Cancer Control Consortium\nand the Susan Jolly Awareness Program.\nTo make sure that everyone knows\nthat today is cervical cancer awareness day,\nthere is a lapel pen and some information on Georgia\nin your desk.\nI also want to share that there's also a news article\nabout Australia in which they have just\nabout eliminated cervical cancer\nbecause of a robust HPV vaccination program.\nSo I want to tell everyone aware of that.\nThank you so much.\nI yield the well.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker, I also want to recognize those that are here for Cancer Awareness\nDay and share a couple of statistics.\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, an estimated 14,000 new cases of cervical cancer\nwill be diagnosed in 2020, and over 4,000 women will be fighting this illness and die by\nthe end of this year.\nWhile these statistics are scary, a lot of this can be prevented with early detection.\nSo, I would encourage all women who are Georgia to please see your primary care physician\nthis year and get a pap smear and hopefully we can eradicate cervical cancer in Georgia.\nThank you.\nChair recognizes Chairman Gerald Greene for a morning order.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nOn Monday, I will celebrate another birthday.\nAnd that is also the holiday that we celebrate.\nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said,\nthe time is always right to do what is right.\nAnd today on his birthday, we remember the life\nof Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. We remember him\nfor his determination and his persistence\nto create a better world for future generations to live in.\nA Georgian native, Dr. King was a minister, an activist,\nand the most visible leader of the Civil Rights Movement\nuntil his tragic assassination in 1968.\nA copaster, the Atlanta-based Ebenezer Baptist Church,\nHe is known for leading the 1955 Montgomery Boy bus boycott.\nThe 1962 struggle against segregation and numerous non-violent protests across the country,\nmost notably in Birmingham and Selma, Alabama.\nIn August of 1963, he helped organize the March on Washington, where he delivered his\nfamous, I have a dream speech to a crowd of roughly 250,000 onlookers. On October\nthe 14th, 1964, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for combating racial inequality\nthrough nonviolent resistance. As public servants, we should all strive to be more like Dr.\nKing. And again, in his words, the time is always right to do what is right. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.\nThe chair recognizes the chairman of the legislative and congressional re-apportionment committee\nChairman Rich for a morning order.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nMy fellow members and our guests in the gallery January is National Blood Donor Month, which\nis an excellent time to celebrate the lifesaving impact of blood and platelet donors and to host\na blood drive.\nWe are currently hosting a blood drive as I speak in a bloodmobile between the CLOB and\nthe capital.\nThey will be there until 2 o'clock.\nIf you have not made an appointment, you can still show up and give blood.\nWhile at Georgia State University, I gave regularly because it was easy.\nThe law school hosted a drive that was right outside my office.\nAnd now we have a drive right outside of our offices.\nFor most of my life, my sister has been chronically ill, and too many times critically so.\nReceiving the gift of blood is just one of the many intercessions that we've experienced\nover the last 30 years, and I venture to say that most of us in this room have a loved\none who has also received this gift.\nNot all of us are medically eligible to give, and there may come a day when I'm not, but\nfor now, while I can, I will.\nYou should know that the American Red Cross currently has a critical shortage of type\nO blood and urgently needs blood donors of all types.\nRight now they have less than a three-day supply of both O negative and O positive blood\ntypes.\nIn January because of severe weather and seasonal illnesses, it's difficult for the Red Cross\nto maintain a sufficient blood supply.\nWhile we are having our wonderfully mild temperatures here, it is an excellent time for\nus to walk outside and climb aboard the bloodmobile.\nI would appreciate it if you all would take some time out of your day to make this amazing\ngift of life.\nThank you.\nI yield a well.\nChair recognizes Representative Kendrick for a morning order.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nGood morning, colleagues.\nI am bringing your black back for today.\nSo today, I would like to honor our 44th president\nof the United States from 2019 to 2017.\nPresident Barack Hussein Obama, he was the first\nAfrican-American president elected to\nand the United States.\nAnd he was regarded as a centrist new Democrat,\nbut he decided he signed many landmark bills\ninto law during his first years in office.\nThis includes the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,\nthe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection\nAct, and repeal the Don't Ask Don't Tale in 2010.\nIn foreign policy, he increased the US troop levels\nin Afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons\nwith the United States, Russia, and New Start Treaty,\nand ended military involvement in the Iraq War.\nHe ordered military involvement in Libya,\ncontributing to the overthrow of Gaddafi.\nHe also ordered the military operations that resulted\nin the deaths of Osama bin Laden and suspected\nAl-Qaeda operative, Al-Walaki.\nA 2018 Gallup poll found Obama to be one of the most\nadmired man in America for the 11th consecutive year.\nAnd in the words of the great philosopher Jay-Z,\nMartin Luther King marked so that Rosa Parks cassette,\nRosa Parks set so that Barack Obama could fly,\nand Barack Obama flew so that I could be here today.\nThat is your Black Fact for today, and thank you very much.\nThank you Mr. Speaker.

Snowden and Harriet Josephine Taylor.\nExcuse me, Terry.\nThank you.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker, and we yield the well.\nChair recognizes representative Stovall\nfor a morning order.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nMembers of the House, it could have been me.\nMaternal mortality is a big issue in Georgia,\nespecially among African-American women\nwho are three to four times likely to die\nthan any other race from pregnancy-related issues.\nWe heard from experts after experts\nin the mortality house study committee.\nWhen Georgia saw that meth and opioid were addictions\nof issues that require specific remedies,\nwe made those recommendations.\nNow that maternal mortality among African-American\nwomen, we see it's an epidemic, and it needs to be addressed.\nIt could have been our sisters and has been our sisters, our daughters, our cousins,\nand our friends.\nThe mortality-specific mortality-house committed study recommendations did not specifically mention\nissues that are specifically related to African-American women.\nIt could be reduced and help to eliminate when there's a greater focus in Georgia on why\nAfrican-American women are dying and higher rate and that solutions can be given, especially\nwhen 60% of those deaths can be prevented.\nAnd the correspondence had been sent to the committee members in reference to this.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nWe year the way up.\nChair recognizes representative Kennerd\nfor a morning order.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nJimmy Meadows is scheduled to be executed\nby lethal injection tomorrow in Jackson, Georgia\nat the state prison.\nIf Jimmy Meadows would be tried today,\nthis would not be a capital case\nfor the state no longer seeks the death penalty\nfor the crime of which Mr. Meadows was convicted in 1989.\nJust 20 minutes into its deliberations in 89,\nMr. Meadows jury sent a note to the judge asking\nif they could impose a sentence of life without parole.\nUnfortunately, life without parole\nwas not yet available in Georgia.\nTheir only option was the death penalty.\nThe Southern Center for Human Rights\nrepresenting Mr. Metters and has spoken with every living juror from his trial and they\nall confirmed that life without parole would have been their verdict had they been given\nthe option to impose it.\nAnd every single one of his surviving jurors support his clemency.\nHis clemency hearing is today before Pardons and Peroles.\nSudden Center further asserts that Mr. Metters could be cleared of the crime through DNA testing\nof the murder weapon because DNA testing that was not available in 1989, unfortunately\na Glen County judge denied this request, a couple of observations. The death penalty\nin this nation is flawed and is defined by bias and error. The Equal Justice Institute\nfounded by Brian Stephenson reports that for every nine people executed, one person on\ndeath row is exonerated, one in nine, an astonishing rate of error when you're talking about\nlife and death. In his book, Just Mercy, Brian Stephenson writes,\nMercy is not something we give to people because they deserve it. Compassion is not what we give because it is owed.\nIt's what we do because it's the way that we find mercy for ourselves. Christ said it this way.\nBlessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.\nChair recognizes representative Dale Washburn to introduce the doctor of the day.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nLadies and gentlemen of the House, it is my pleasure and privilege to introduce Dr. Reina\nMuner, who is our doctor of the day.\nDr. Muner began medical school at the age of 45 at Mercy University School of Medicine\nand Makin.\nShe then completed her internal medicine residency at the Atlanta Medical Center, became\nboard certified and began her private practice in Macon.\nDr. Moonin was president of the Bib County Medical Society in 2013 and serves as a delegate\nannually to the AMA House of Delegates.\nShe is on the faculty at Marshall University School of Medicine and routinely mentors\nmedical students there.\nOne of the things that Dr. Mooner with everything she has accomplished, and I'm departing from\nthe script for a moment, one of the things she has proudest of, understandably, is her\nson Christian, who is in special forces and who has been deployed to Afghanistan on\nthree occasions.\nHe is now in special forces, as I mentioned.\nDr. Mooner is married to Joseph E. Glough, a cattle farmer who owns a rocking chair ranch\nin Monroe County, and he is with us today.\nHe provides grass fed beef to several Georgia residents\nand local markets.\nDr. Mooner has served us as Dr.\nof the day faithfully over the years.\nI asked her a few minutes ago, I said,\nDr. How many times have you done this?\nAnd she said, well, I can't really remember,\nbut at least eight times.\nAnd so it's my pleasure today to introduce to you,\nDr. Rainer Mooner, Dr. of the day.\nThank you so much for that.\nThis is a huge pleasure for me to be here to serve you today on behalf of Bib County\nMedical Society.\nWe understand that this is a sacrifice for you and you're being selfless.\nWe know you don't get paid a lot to do this and it's hard.\naway from your families, you're away from your homes.\nI just want to tell you that one of the great things that Dale Washburn did when he ran\nfor office, he came and sat with us at the Bib County Med Society Board meeting one\nmorning and just gave us a chance to pick his brain and it was a great day.\nWe learned about him, we felt like he would represent us very well.\nWe went out as new advocates of his and look here who he is.\nSo use your medical societies and let them pick your brain once in a while.\nThey love to have you come sit with them.\nI look forward to taking care of you today.\nIf you're sick, great.\nIf you're not sick and you have a medical question, just come and ask me.\nI love to talk about medicine.\nThank you for allowing me to serve you.\nThe members of the house, please find your seat.\nFind your seats. We have a very special recognition.\nClerk will read the caption to House Resolution 886.\nHouse Resolution 886, by the way.\nWe have green and 151st, we're all still in the 7th Chocos Thumb 38th.\nNext to the 69th and Harold the 106th.\nA resolution recognizing him and commending a Karen and Eric Bunk of Ritzland Distilling\nCompany and for other purposes.\nChairman Green was kind enough to let me say a word or two about these friends of mine.\nWe have talked a lot in this house over the last few years about rural development and\nbringing jobs to rural Georgia.\nLet me tell you something.\nIf you have never been to the Richland Rum to Stilery in Richland, Georgia, you are in\nfor a treat.\nEric, Vaughnck and Karen have brought that business.\nI was there many years ago when they were having been off the ground very long and it is\na class organization and I understand that they are now in the top tier of sales all over\nthe world.\nAnd it's rum made here in Georgia by Georgians putting Georgians to work.\nLet me say one more thing.\nThat rum makes a fantastic rum cake, or so I'm told.\nChair recognizes Chairman Gerald Green for an invite\nresolution.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nHe knows what he speaks of.\nMany years ago, I was called to Richland, Georgia.\nAnd they wanted me to come and meet some individuals.\nAnd they cared me to, to burn down warehouses,\nwrite their own broadsery, horrible-looking buildings.\nAnd they said, we want to build a rum distillery here.\nI thought, my gosh, that's impossible.\nWell, I want you to know it's not impossible.\nFor those two individuals right behind me, Eric Vunk and his wife, Karen, they are the\nhardest working individuals to bring about some revitalization to downtown Richland, Georgia.\nAnd now they are in Brunswick, Georgia.\nAnd so be careful if you are wanting a place, they'll be there too, but we're not going\nto lose them in rich than Georgia. And I'm not going to take up much time. I want you to hear\nfrom this individual Eric Bonk, please.\nMr. Speaker, representative Green, it's kind of hard to find words that adequately describe\nthe gratitude that Karen and I feel for the opportunity to be here and frankly we believe honestly\nthat the gratitude should be all ours. The Georgia we have learned to know Georgia\nthrough an initiative by then Commissioner of Industry and Trade Randy Cardosa in 1991\nto, as the best state to do business in the Union, it is absolutely true. The proactive\ngovernment support that exists here does not exist anywhere else. And with your leadership,\nMr. Speaker, and with efforts like yours, Gerald, and Alan Powell on the regulated industries\ncommittee. We would not be able to have built this business, which now distributes\nRichland-Rum made in Georgia in 15 states and exports it to 11 countries. As business\nas entrepreneurs, we have registered two trademarks. One is Georgia's spirit and the other\none is the spirit of Georgia. Georgia's spirit is Richland Rum. It's only\ningredients are homegrown sugar cane and water from the Georgia aquifer. The\nspirit of Georgia is what lives in the company. It's people and the state which\nis home to the company. It's the spirit of Georgia that has developed us and is\nnow helping us to export the best spirit thinkable to mankind. Thank you so much for everything you've done over the years to make this possible.\nI know we won't recognize it, but I have a little question.\nI'm sorry, Representative Williams, for what purpose do you rise?\nElementary in the room.\nState your inquiry.\nBefore they leave, I'm certain that there are samples in the alley room so we can get\ninto the spirit of George.\nI'm going to let you take that up with Chairman Green over here, but I am sure if he's\ndone his homework, he had him bring some.\nClerk will read the caption to a group of privileged resolutions.\nOrganizing commending Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church on the Granitation of its 150th anniversary.\nHonoring and commending the individual member organizations and their staff as members\nas a service provider's association\nfor developmental disabilities\nand celebrating their day at the Capitol on January 16th, 2020.\nCommending, graduating, Liam Thomas Roby,\nrecognizing January 28th, 2020 is Georgia's\nSpeech Language Hearing Association Day\nat the State Capitol.\nCommending, graduating, Sheriff Colin Talton.\nCommending, Dr. Kimberly Duber,\nClayton County Public Schools, 2019-2020, Principal of the Year.\nCommending Annette McCraw, Clayton County Public Schools, 2019-2020, Support Professional of the Year, Certified.\nCommending Dr. Shakira Cheney, Clayton County Public Schools, 2019-2020, Support Leader of the Year, Certified.\nCommending a Marcus Holston Clayton County Public Schools in 2019 and 2020 support\nprofessional of the year classified.
