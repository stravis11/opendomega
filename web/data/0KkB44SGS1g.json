  "transcript": "\n\nyou you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you 11 4 Objection that in a feeling well today. We're going to begin our day with scripture reading in prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 176 House District, Chairman James Bershitt, Chairman Bershitt. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and colleagues. Thank you for allowing me to come before you this morning. It's not often that I get the opportunity to introduce a friend of mine from high school. Dr. Jonathan Smith played football with me in high school and then went to Georgia Southern with me. He lives in Staceboro now so I did have to do a little poaching of some of my colleagues pastors to get him here today, but I appreciate that opportunity. Dr. Smith serves as the director of the Wesley Foundation at Georgia Southern University and the pastor at Pittman Park University United Methodist Church in Staceboro, Georgia. Throughout his time at the Wesley Foundation, Dr. Smith has helped create spaces for students to grow in life and in faith and successfully plant a Wesley Foundation on the Armstrong campus of the Georgia Southern University. Dr. Smith serves as a leadership consultant and a coach with the United Methodist Commission on Higher Education and Campus Ministries where he works to equip campus ministers across the United States with skills that help them reach the next generation with the gospel. Dr. Smith is a graduate of Georgia Southern University, Go Eagles. He completed his Masters of Divinity at the Canler School of Theology and Emery at the Emery University and is doctorate at the Columbia Theological Seminary. Dr. Smith and his wife Stephanie both serve as ordained elders in South Georgia in the South Georgia annual conference of the United Methodist Church. They have two daughters, Addison, who wants me to tell you she's 13 but she doesn't turn 13 until next week, who's here with us today. And Lily Grace, who is nine without further ado, Dr. Jonathan Smith. Mr. Speaker, thank you for having me this morning. Ladies and gentlemen of the Georgia House of Representatives, it's my honor and privilege to be among you this morning. Representative Barchett, thank you for the invitation to be here. Representative Tankersley, Burns and Parrish, thank you for representing the people of Bullock County here at the Capitol. Your leadership is not only well known but it's greatly appreciated. It's been my privilege the last seven years to serve as the director of the Wesley Foundation at Georgia Southern University and during that time, I've journeyed with students through what I believe to be the most formative years of their lives. 18 to 24-year-olds though they are adults in the eyes of the law are just beginning to discern who and what they are going to be. They're emerging adults, a phrase coined by psychologist Jeffrey Arnett. These students, these emerging adults, they're in the process of becoming, in the process of making decisions that set the course for the next 40, 50, 60 years of their lives. In my work, we talk about our students discovering three things throughout their time at college and at Georgia Southern that can be four, five, six years. We hope that they leave our ministry and leave our campus for that matter knowing who their master is, who it is or what it is that they will submit their lives to. Second, we hope they will learn what their mission is or what they will give their lives for. And third, who their people will be, who they're going to journey with throughout the rest of their lives. These students are literally becoming who they're going to be in this season of life called college. And while that notion can be exhilarating, it's also often terrifying. Let's be honest, the stakes are really high during that season of life. If you get any one of those questions wrong, who's my master? What's my mission and who are my people? Your life will be on the rocks in short order. That season of life is exhilarating and terrifying. Believe me, week after week, I counsel and disciple students who bounce between those two different places. I imagine that your work here is much to the same. You are engaged in the process of becoming. The process of building something and not just bills and legislations but a state of people, a rule of law to guide and direct the citizens of Georgia. Quite literally, you are making decisions that set the course of our lives together for the next 40, 50 or 60 years. What you do here in this great assembly affects the lives of people beyond those doors for good or for ill. There is great potential in the work that you are doing both for our benefit and to our detriment. And that notion is again exhilarating or terrifying. It can excite you where it can paralyze you. It can cause you to open your hearts to new possibilities or make you hard in your heart and close your mind. It can move you to action or it can stop you dead in your tracks. Your work is a high calling. And while there are many armchair politicians, there are very few who are willing to sacrifice their time, their energy, their resources and perhaps even their reputation to build a better future for the people of Georgia. And that is your calling. You are here to build a stronger, more vibrant, more competitive state for us all. And I believe in you. We the people of Georgia, we believe in you. Otherwise you wouldn't be here. We are trusting that you will represent us well and guide us in to God's good future for us. And that sort of leadership is not easy. It takes courage. It takes heart. It's far easier to build a platform to stand on a pedestal or to build a following than it is to put your hand to the plow and lead effectively. It's far easier to give a speech than it is to make a difference. It's far easier to politic than it is to govern. So my charge to you this morning is simple and it's found in Galatians chapter 6 verses 9 and 10. Their Paul writing to that church in Galatia says, let us not become weary in doing good. It's day 34 I believe. Let us not grow weary in doing good. For at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. Therefore as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially those who are members of the family of God. Do not grow weary in doing good for us all. You friends have the opportunity to make a difference for all of us today. I believe that the answers to our state's challenges are in this room and the leaders for our states present and future are in this room. Don't give up, don't stop, don't quit, keep working to help us become the state that we are created to be. Let us now go to God in prayer. Almighty God, we thank you for this day. For the opportunities it holds for us and for this state. I thank you for the leaders in this great room and the ways that you are using them to draw us forward into your good future for us. May their actions and decisions today bring honor and glory to you. May their work embody both love of God and love of neighbor. This we pray in the name of God, our creator, redeemer and friend. Amen. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic over which it stands one nation under God, individual, liberty and justice are all. Thank you sir. Doorkeepers will unlock the doors. Members may greet the chaplain in the south any room. The chair recognizes chairman Hogan, the chair of the committee on information and audits.

One minute each for morning orders and the messenger is going to strictly enforce that. We've gotten a little bit lax with it. They recognize this chairman nicks for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, I've got some good news for you this morning, but I also have some bad news for you. The good news is this, on crossover day, the Senate voted down their gambling legislation. The bad news is the sponsor says we've got a vehicle for them to ride that thing through the house on. I have put an article on your desk entitled America's gambling addiction is metastasizing. And I hope you'll take a look at that as I tell you before, gambling is not dead until the big guy behind me hits that big old hammer and says, sunny day. So I expect that monster to come back most any day now. Probably could come today because they like to come after dark and stormy night. Couple of things I'd get you to look at on page four. Transactions once considered the purview of the mafia have now been mainstreamed. Credit lines with 23%. Gambling relies on addiction for its business model to function. Gambling ruins lives by way of soul crushing debt. Don't let the Senate let us, don't let this house resurrect a bad idea that died in the Senate. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes Chairman Jasper's for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, you might listen up real quick. Every time we do road namings throughout the year, I'm asked, Chairman Jasper's, how do I pay for this ad? Who do I get to pay for this sign? Do I take it out of my campaign funds or do I get somebody else to pay for it? Did a little research? You can use your expense reimbursement account. You follow their rules. You can use it for your ads and for the sign. So just make sure you follow their rules. That would be very successful. Also Mr. Speaker, in the any room, Mama Geraldine's famous age cheese straws. They're available all over the state of Georgia. This is a Georgia grown, Pickens County grown from the beginning to right now. They do a great job. Very tasty. I hope you enjoy them. And Mr. Speaker, thank you. I recognize his representative Hucley for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House. I need to have everybody's attention for one second. On tomorrow, we are starting the celebration of the Dean of this House for his farewell. You're all invited to his farewell reception tomorrow from 5 to 7 at the College with Ball Hall of Fame. We are looking for you. Let us know that you're coming. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield a well. Chair recognizes representative Wolenski for a morning order. Thank you, Speaker. I got an exciting announcement. We are launching the Georgia Israel Legislative Caucus tomorrow morning at 10 a.m. There will be a big press conference. There will be members from the Middle East and Gulf states in that area representing the Abraham Accords will be there. International folks will have great speakers. It's a huge event. The purpose of this caucus, much like the Georgia, Japan caucus, is to show the mutually beneficial relationship between Georgia and Israel. Local, military, agriculture, export, imports, and Georgia and Israel, such a good relationship that we're going to show everybody how important it is. I hope all y'all will join the caucus. Thank you all so much. Chair recognizes representative Edna Jackson for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. To my fellow representative, it is an honor to tell you about Mamie George Williams. You have information on your desk. He was born in Savannah. I educated at Beach High School at Atlanta University. It became very active. In 1920, she was a member. She was very much involved in politics. This is unusual woman. She is African American. But if you look at the picture that's on your desk, it is very difficult to tell. Miss Williams, politics involved being a part of the party of the year at that time, which was the party of Lincoln. She earned all kind of recognition and became the first African American a woman to the national convention and a member of the Republican committee. She also organized over 200 women here in the state of Georgia, a trailblazer. For you, I said I see the light as red. But if you will just read and join us in recognizing Miss Williams. They recognize this representative scothel for a morning order. I saw a shade from Tickness Park. I think you missed the speaker and colleagues. Today is Lupus Advocacy Day at the Capitol. Lupus is an autoimmune disease that impacts over 90,000 Georgians. They are our families, live in our districts, attend our churches with us, and serve in this body. Thank you to the Georgia chapter of the Lupus Foundation of America, Lupus Advocates, Lupus Warriors across Georgia and the caregivers. For they are amazing work. For many, we know that Lupus sucks. We are making strides in our research, advocacy, and awareness. Thank you continually, thank you for all of the work they do in being Lupus champions. Thank you for wearing your cape. We are truly Lupus superheroes. Thank you. I yield the well. I have. Chair recognizes representative Angela Moore for a morning order. Just a reminder, everyone, that today is agricultural hero day. We are celebrating Kendall Ray Johnson, the youngest farmer here in Georgia. She is six years old. She's downstairs vetting every media here in the state of Georgia and New York in California. So she's really getting a good taste of what Georgia hero is all about. And we ask you to help support her down at the South Portico after session. Thank you. Chair recognizes representative Jasmine Clark for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This morning I rise to congratulate the Trichon Middle School Tiger Bots, the school's robotic team that will travel to Houston, Texas next month and compete in the 2022 first which stands for for inspiration and recognition of science and technology, robotics world championships. Only one hundred and eight teams out of twenty four thousand teams and fifty different countries are competing in this competition. So we are immensely proud of our Tiger Bots for their outstanding work and this amazing opportunity. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House will come to order and take your seats. We have a couple of other special orders. Chair recognizes for a special order representative Dwayne Heels representative field. I promise that I'm not going to be too long. I got my scroll out here so well I got it is here. No, I'm just kidding. I wasn't going to say anything but I feel I need to. People I want to thank. My wife. It's a tougher and what I thought it'd be. She's probably better known around here than I am. I walked down the hall and somebody will say now who are you? My name is Dwayne Heel. Oh, your wand is husband, aren't you? So that's how they know me. I tell her every day that I love her more today. Then I did yesterday and I mean that our children, our daughters down Laura, our sons Wade, Joey and her youngest Brandon. I promised my brother and mom that I'd mention he's a name too.

My church family, my admin, Delane Roberts, all the doorkeepers who made it pleasant. Michael Ralston, who my admire for his leadership, his patience with all of us.

So when I get to heaven I'll ask why me Lord, why is it that I get to serve was such a distinguished ladies and gentlemen. I love you. The Bible teaches me to love one another as we love ourselves. If we do that we'll be in great company. When I first got here I didn't have nothing but a badge. My name tag, I didn't have my badge. So somebody said you got to get a badge. I said well where did I go to get that? I didn't know. So you got to go to the speakers office. I said okay. Excuse me, where's the speakers office on third floor? I said okay so I come up to the third floor and I start my trip around. So let's see some guys that I had met and I waved at them second time around. I said yeah I'll do it okay. I didn't want to tell them I was lost so the third time I come around. I said well one more trip and I've got my workout in for the day. So then I come around one more time and there was a young man standing there and I'm headed in that direction and I said do you know where the speaker office is? He said yes sir he turned around and said there it is. So I done passed that thing four times. But it's been a good experience. I wouldn't take nothing for it.

The speaker I thank him and Sheree have become part of our family. And I want to leave you with this. The day is long. My time is short.

Clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 341. Senate Bill 341, my Senator Kropatric, the 32nd Watson, the first Burke of the 11th and others being titled back to amend Article 2, Chapter 46, in Title 33, the Fish Go to Georgia and in Tederley, the prior authorizations of healthcare services so sort of guidelines for the prior authorization of prescribed medication for chronic conditions requiring ongoing medication therapy. This bill I've referred to the Committee on Health and Human Services. The Committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes Chairman Newton to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, colleagues. I appreciated the support shown by the capes by heroes working against a chronic medical illness called Lupus. It's one that I've dealt with in the challenges and patients in the emergency department. Together, I bring you Senate Bill 341 today. That does give us an opportunity in a small but effective way of changing the lives of Georgians who do have chronic medical conditions. Senate Bill 341 addresses us a simple area but a crucial area for people that have a chronic medication need for a chronic condition. And that's the effort of going through what's called a prior authorization. Usually you can get two or three months of a medicine at once. What can typically happen is if you need a special medicine for your condition, your chronic condition, you have to go through what's called prior authorization. The patient and the doctor have to work together on that. Senate Bill 341 simply maintains that if you go through prior authorization once in a year, that's good for 12 months or until the end of your contract with your insurance company. You don't have to do it every three months. It's a small but effective step to assure that patients can get the medications they need. And they can get them with the minimal amount of disruption in their lives. They already have the disruption of a chronic medical condition. This just helps them do it with the least amount of interference and for the doctor and the patient to work together in a positive way. I hope you'll support Senate Bill 341. Mr. Speaker, I'll yield for any questions if there are. You have a couple of questions if you care to yield. I'm glad to. Yes sir. I yield. Chair recognizes representative Kouscher to your left for a question. Thank you. That's a gentleman yield. I did. Thank you for bringing this bill just a very quick question. We discuss a lot about mental health these days and in my mind, mental health disease can be regarded as a chronic disease. Would this bill cover prescriptions that are mental health related and substance abuse disorder is ordered related? The lady brings up an excellent point. This covers all medications for chronic medical conditions that are expected to last over 12 months. And as we've been going over so much in mental illness can be so much better treated if people will get on their medications and stay on them, avoiding emergency departments, hospitalization, commitments, and you're absolutely right. It will cover those as well. Thank you. Do you further yield? Yes sir. Chair recognizes representative Kinert to your left for a question. Yes, this is gentleman yield. Yes sir. What is the current timeline for most approvals? Most of the time it's a 90 day for medication so it will require the patient and the physician office to reapply each time. This just will streamline it to where you can get it once a year and it actually does cover dosage changes during that year as well as long as it's the same medication. Thank you. Thank you. With that, Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the well and appreciate your support. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none of the previous question is ordered.

Senate Bill 493 is exactly the same bill as House Bill 1088 that we passed out of here. What this does is it changes a time share and it only applies to time shares. Changes a foreclosure on time shares from judicial to non-judicial. Makes it more efficient for them to do that. I'll take any questions. Do you yield for questions? I do.

Chair recognizes representative meeks to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I have the opportunity to bring to you today Senate Bill 396, Georgia grown farm to food bank program bill that came over from the Senate. Farmers across our state day in and day out work very diligently to provide the most affordable, safest, most abundant food supply in the world. We work as they do is the active half of duty and it's also true that time and nature also provides opportunities and limitations to aspects that are critical in agriculture. The farm to food bank program is a program that was in current code. We have now funded the program at 800,000 updates to code to allow Georgia growers to sell to food banks across our state, therefore providing fresh fruit and vegetables that are grown in Georgia to food banks to then provide to those that are less fortunate. Food banks across Georgia reported they received 14 million pounds of produce each year, but turn away four to five million pounds of produce because there is a lack of funding. No funds have been appropriated to this to this program since its inception of 1998. So we're in the budget putting in 800,000 and then updating the current code to allow for the Department of Agriculture to establish the program.
