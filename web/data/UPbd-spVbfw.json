Cod of Georgia anit\nrelating to protective order registry so\nas to revise certain definitions this\nbill having F committee on Judiciary\nthat committee recommends that this bill\ndo\npass repres representative Martinez is\nrecognized to present the Bill thank you\nMr Speaker I Rise here today to present\nHouse Bill\n325 um military protective Board of\nregistry first of all Mr Speaker I want\nto thank a couple of of U uh folks that\nhelped me with this bill and there\nthey're on my right uh and Deputy adant\nGeneral Joe Ferrero and Georgia National\nGuard State judge Colonel Brian Bishoff\nwho drafted the Bill thank you so much\nfor your service sir thank you also with\nthe uh chief of military Justice\nLieutenant Colonel Edward pesta uh Mr\nSpeaker and colleagues this uh hp25\nprovides the National Guard and its\nmilitary judge a mechanism to issue\nmilitary protective orders to prevent\ndeter and punish service member on\nservice member stalking and protect the\ngood order and discipline with within\nthe organization military protective\norders issued by commanders in the\nGeorgia National Guard do not\nsufficiently protect service members\nvictimized by stalking because Georgia\nlaw does not provide adequate mechanisms\nto enforce npos while any commander May\nissue npos to a subordinate npos have\nsignificant limitations under their\nexisting Authority the currently npos\nonly apply when National Guard Personnel\nare military status leaving gaps when\nPersonnel are not in military\nstatus approximately 85% of our service\nmembers serve in traditional status that\nleads 28 days each month where npos are\nunforce for most service members at\nadditionally npos are typically only\nenforced on military installations yet\nmost National Guard Personnel reside off\ninstallations because the limited en\nforceably of npos increased risk of\nvictims so HB 325 seeks to improve\nenforcement mechanisms to mitigate the\nrisk the purpose of HB 325 IS to include\na mechanism under Georgia Code of\nmilitary Justice for our state\nmilitary's judge to consider verified\npetitions for protective orders and\nissue enforcable protective orders to\nprotect stalking victims 24 hours a day\n7 days a week the bill extends authority\nto the National Guard and our state's\nmilitary judge to prevent deter and\npunish stalking with similar mechanisms\navailable in our Superior Courts the\nproposed statute only applies to service\nmember on service member allegations\nthis bill does not apply to civilian on\nservice members or service members on\ncivilian allegations the proposed\nlegislation addresses service member on\nservice member stalking to protect a\ngood order discipline and morale with\nthe Georgia National\nGuard npos will be enforceable through\nour military judge and our courts\nMarshal this bill gives the military\njudge content powers to compel obedience\nto npos in the same manner and subject\nto the same Li to the same limitations\nas authorized in Georgia civilian courts\nProvisions include up to 30 days in\nconfinement and a f of 1,000 under HB\n325 npos will be lawful military orders\nalso subjecting

would you read\nthe caption to House Bill\n123 123 house 123 by representative work\nhigh of the 157th and others being\ntitled act to amend title 17 in the\nfishal go to Georgia annotated relating\nto criminal procedure s to provide for\npre-trial proceedings in capital offense\ncases where the death penalty is sought\nthis bill have referred to the committee\non Judiciary non- civil that committee\nrecommends this bill do\npass representative workizer is\nrecognized to present his\nBill thank you Mr Speaker House Bill\n123 there's 40 there's 27 states that\nhave capital\npunishment Georgia is an outlier and\nthat is the only one that allows those\nwith intellectual disabilities to be\nexecuted for two reasons and this bill\nfixes both of those number one is the\nstandard of changing it from Beyond A\nReasonable Doubt to a\npreponderance of evidence this is what\nthe other 26 states\ndo also the only uh thing that Georgia\ndoes is they decide on intellectual\ndisabilities and at the end of the trial\nso think about this after you've heard\ntwo weeks of gruesome details and seeing\nthings you wish you could\nunsee then you're asked to decide on the\nin on the intellectual dis disability of\nan\nindividual when in\nreality this is not like an insanity or\nany other plea this is intellectual\ndisability is something you're born with\nand so you either have ID or you don't\nand so this would move to a pre-trial\nmotion by the\ndefense and the defense in the state\nwould get to here go before a decider of\nfact which would be the court and they\nwould decide if the person has an\nintellectual\ndisability and then they would have the\ntrial portion of the case that is the\ntwo things that the bill does and Mr\nSpeaker with that I'll yield the well if\nthere's no questions has a couple of\nquestions representing silox straight up\nthe aisle on the right is recognized for\na question thank you Mr Speaker does the\ngentleman yield absolutely Mr chairman\nthere was testimony committee that the\nstate does not seek the death penalty\nfor individuals with intellectual\ndisabilities do you believe that to be\ntrue absolutely do not and I kind of\ncringe when I heard that and I'm going\nto give you one example there's several\nin\n2015 the state had heard testimony about\nWarren\nHill and it was very evident that the\ndefense had said that he was severely\nmentally\nand thanks to Scott Hilton his\nfirst freshman bill that that phrase has\nbeen strucken stricken from Georgia Code\nthroughout the argument was not whether\nhe had idea or not but whether we should\nexecute him and the interesting thing is\nthe seven judges this is about as split\nas you could get the Georgia Supreme\nCourt was split four to3 to execute\nWarren\nHill and the interesting thing is three\nof the judges pointed\nto the 2002 Atkins versus\nVirginia when our US Supreme Court\nsaid it violates the eth amendment of\ncruel and unusual punishment to execute\nsomebody with intellectual\ndisability so those three judges pointed\nto that ruling the interesting thing is\nthe other four judges pointed to that\nexact same ruling because also in that\nSupreme Court Atkins versus Virginia\nthey said it violated the eth amendment\nbut it was up to the states to decide\nhow to fix it so Virginia Florida Texas\nfixed their laws Georgia did\nnot this will be that fix and I could\npoint you to other cases of that one as\nlate as March 30th of last year\nbut so no I do not believe that thank\nyou so much for bringing the\nbill and gentlemen further yield I'll\ntake one more representative Reeves to\nyour right is recognized to speak to the\nthank you speak question with the\nchairman you for a question absolutely\nis it not true that the Catholic\nArchbishop from Atlanta came here to the\ncapitl and as well as many other Faith\nleaders to earnestly request this bill\nand this bill leaves the death penalty\nintact for C blooded Killers who were\nnot intellectually disabled that is\nabsolutely true and I've got a letter\nfrom over a hundred religious\norganizations who have supported this\nbill the Georgia Council on disabilities\nand many other\norganizations um it does leave for those\nwho believe in capital punishment it\nleaves it intact but not for those who\nare intellectually disabled Mr Speaker\nI'm going yield to well but I want to as\nyou and I have a very close friend uh in\nJack Hill who whose favorite saying was\nthat Turtle did not get on that fence\npost by itself and so want to thank a\ncouple of people who's gone before me\nthis issue has been fought over for\nyears Scott Hilton Beth Moore who our\nformer state representative Brett\nHarrell uh Kathy Harmon Christian who\ngot your attention and sent I guess you\nsent her to me um and many other\norganizations who have fought to get\nthis bill passed so I hope we can get it\nover to the Senate and get it done thank\nyou and I ask for your favorable\nconsideration gentlemen J and well thank\nyou for your work Mr chairman we have a\ncouple of\nspeakers they'll have up to 10 minutes\nfor your presentations chairman Tyler\nPaul Smith has recognized to speak to\nthe bill House Bill\n123 thank you Mr Speaker especially for\nthe 10 minutes was as slow as I talk\nsometimes\nuh Mr Speaker members of this August\nbody I know we're in Rapid Fire but I\nwould ask that you pay attention to this\nbill stand before you today to implore\nyour support for this great piece of\nlegislation I want to thank chairman\nworker and those that have worked on\nthis issue for\ndecades this is not getting rid of the\ndeath penalty for those who do not\nsuffer from intellectual disabilities\nthis\nlegislation not just a procedural\nAmendment it's a necessary reform to\nuphold the rights of individuals with\nintellectual disabilities and ensure\nthat our Criminal Justice System\noperates with both integrity and\ncompassion we're going to go into the\nweeds a little bit here with me but bear\nwith me on it this legislation\nestablishes a clear fair and structured\nprocess that allows a defendant to\npresent evidence of intellectual\ndisability before trial it ensures that\nno individual who qualifies as\nintellectually disabled will face the\ndeath penalty preventing the risk of\nwrongful\nexecution furthermore it respects the\nrole of the Judiciary by granting judges\nthe authority to make pre-trial\ndeterminations reducing unnecessary\ndelays and ensuring efficiency in our\nCapital\ncases beyond the legal\nprinciples legal leads of this this bill\nreflects our state's shared\nvalues and our belief in our statement\nof wisdom Justice and\nmoderation we must recognize that\nintellectual disability affects an\nindividual's ability to understand those\ncomplex legal proceedings not to\nmention their actions and the results\nthereof but to also participate\nmeaningfully in their defense\nHouse Bill 123 ensures that we do not\npunish\nindividuals who lack the requisite\nculpability or for those of you who\nstudy Latin the men's Rea to Warrant the\nharshest penalty available under law\nthat being\ndeath this bill does not eliminate\naccountability it actually refines our\njustice system to ensure that punishment\nis proportional and\nappropriate for instance a defendant\nfound to have an in intellectual\ndisability will still be subject to life\nimprisonment therefore not absolving\nthem of the responsibility of their\naction however this legislation\nguarantees that Justice is administered\nin a manner consistent with our\nconstitutional obligations and moral\nresponsibilities I hope as you join me\nin passing this great piece of\nlegislation that we take this necessary\nstep towards strengthening the Integrity\nof our legal system ensuring due process\npreventing the reversible miscarriages\nof justice and I appreciate y'all's time\nand consideration here today with that\nMr Speaker I'll yield the\nwill thank you sir gentleman yielded the\nwell represent Panic recognize speak to\nthe bill up to 10 minutes I'll take\nthree\ncolleagues executing an intellectually\ndisabled person is not an act of justice\nbut a moral fail\nfailure these individuals by definition\nare less culpable they cannot fully\ngrasp the depth of their actions nor can\nthey navigate the intricate legal system\ndesigned to protect our rights to put to\nput them to death is to punish them for\na cognitive limitation that they did not\nchoose a limitation in in essence a part\nof their fundamental human identity\nwe are not defined by how we treat the\nthe strongest among us but how we\nprotect the most vulnerable an\nintellectually disabled individual\nfacing the death penalty is the ultimate\ntest of our Collective moral character\nand I submit that we must choose\ncompassion over retribution and\nunderstanding over\npunishment we have the death penalty in\nthe state I'm not here to debate it but\nif we're going to meet out the ultimate\npunishment it should only be for the\nworst of the worst and for those we have\nspent the time to make\nsure understand their\nculpability I urge you to vote Yes on\nthis great\nbill I yelled The\nWell the lady has yielded the well\nthat concludes all of our presentations\non House Bill 123 is there any objection\nto the previous question

m speaker good afternoon\nladies and gentlemen of the house house\nbill 37 is like most of my legisl this\nyear another shot at trying to get\nsomething through the Senate so this was\na bill we passed yesterday off the floor\nthat requires school districts to give\nnotice to their employees of of whether\nor not they are going to withhold Social\nSecurity if they don't other plans that\nmight be comparable that they would be\neligible for and then periodically renew\nthat notice every 5 years and then upon\nseparation tell them if they have\nwithheld any social getting a little bit\nof a ring here Social Security the\nreason for this is school districts do\nnot have to withhold they do not have to\nparticipate in Social Security they can\nopt out and a number of them have so\nthis is to try to just make sure\nemployees know the origin of this was\nthat a retired Educators meeting in my\ndistrict one of the members apparently\ndid not realize the school district she\nworked for did not withhold and had a\nvery unpleasant surprise at retirement\nso we're just trying to make sure those\nsurprises are kept to a minimum and\nthat's the bill I would greatly\nappreciate your support we'll stand for\nany\nquestions gentleman y you have a\nquestion to your left representative\nrice yes sir way to your left as\nrecognized for a question ladies\nrecognized thank you Mr Speaker does the\ngentleman yield yes ma'am is it not true\nthat requiring local school systems to\nnotify employees about their social\nsecurity withholdings and

homework\nuh 15-\n9-2 and then the article 6 courts and\n15-9\n-4 I'll yield for any questions\ngentleman has no questions thank you Mr\nSpeaker I'll yield well and ask this\nbody's favorable\nconsideration gentleman has yielded the\nwell is there any objection to the\nprevious question being ordered hearing\nnone the previous question is ordered is\nthere any objection to agreeing to the\nreport of the committee which was\nfavorable to the passage of the bill\nhearing n report of the committee is\nagreed to shall this this bill now\npassed all in favor of the passage of\nthe bill we'll vote Yes all those\nopposed will vote no and Mr clerk will\nyou unlock the machine\n[Music]\nhave all members\nvoted all members\nvoted if so Mr clerk will you lock the\nmachine on the passage of House Bill 180\ny r 171 the N are zero this bill having\nreceived the requisite constitutional\nmajority is therefore passed\nMr clerk will you read a caption the\nhouse bill 406\n46 House Bill 406 by representative\nlever of the 123rd to be entitled act to\namend chapter 23 of title 47 the\nofficial code of Georgia anator relating\nthe Georgia judicial retirement system\nso as to increase the retirement age of\nSuperior Court judges for taking office\non or after July 1st 2026 this bill that\nreferred to the committee on Judiciary\nthat committee recommends that this bill\ndo pass\nby committee\nsubstitute representative Leverett is\nrecognized to present the\nBill thank you Mr Speaker ladies and\ngentlemen hello again uh I've got today\nas house or again now as another bill\nthis is House Bill 406 and the clerk uh\nreally summarized it in reading the\ncaption although it was initially\nassigned to Judy it was later\ntransferred to retirement this bill\nwould change the retirement age for\nSuperior Court judges that are appointed\nor elected after July 1 of this year\ncurrently their retirement age like\neverybody in I believe they're in Jrs is\n60 this would increase it to 65 uh this\nis I suppose you would say it's somewhat\nof a companion piece of legislation to\nthe restructuring of the judicial pay\nthat you passed off the floor earlier\nthis year this is something the judges\nhave agreed to uh sort of as a to to\ntravel with that uh if you will they're\nthey're asking us to make a greater\nState commitment to relieve the locals\nof some of the burden of the and this is\na way for them to slightly amarate the\nstate's uh commitment with respect to\nthe retirement so it would not apply to\nany existing super court judge but would\njust apply to Future Super Court judges\nit is a non-fiscal retirement bill\nbecause it's going to actually save the\nstate money so that is basically the um\nthe bill and it is agreed to by the Su\nCourt judges

the\ncaption to House Bill\n7979 House Bill 79 by representative\nNewton of the 127th being titled act to\namend chapter 7 of title 480 the\nofficial Cod of Georgia annotated\nrelating to income taxes as to provide a\ntax credit for certain eligible expenses\nincurred for firearm Safe Handling\ninstructional courses and Firearm secure\nstorage devices this bill ader the\ncommittee on ways and means that\ncommittee recommends that this bill do\npass by committee\n[Music]\nsubstitute chairman Newton is recognized\nto present the bill chairman\nNewton thank you Mr Speaker it's good to\nbe back um the house has been engaged\nreally in a multi-prong effort for a\nlong time caring for our youth and our\nchildren uh we want to educate them we\nwant to strengthen families we've worked\nhard on foster care and U adoption bills\nand I think a little later we're going\nto uh work on some bills to try to keep\nchildren safe in an often dangerous\nWorld House Bill 79 is an additional\nstep in that effort it provides an\noption for a tax credit to do two things\nto obtain a firearm Safe Handling\ninstruction course or to obtain a\nfirearm secure storage\ndevice so House Bill 79 recognizes a few\ndifferent things um the firearm deaths\nare actually the leading cause CA of\ndeath of Youth and children under\n19 even exceeding motor vehicle\naccidents it's very important to clarify\nthat though because over 60% of these\nare homicides those are uh felony\ncriminal actions uh that are already\nagainst the law and that they're\nobviously a a major source of of loss of\nlife very often Gang Related I am proud\nof a lot of the work this house has done\nto uh to do the Attorney General's tax\nuh I'm sorry task force on a gang\nactivity uh we've done some work to try\nto decrease the recruitment of of gang\nmembers and miners we've done working on\nthat along the way so along with that\nincreased crime though we've had a lot\nof law enforcement challenges later uh\nmost recently so that's part of the\nreason behind the uh safe instructional\nuh handling course an instructional\ncourse on Safe Handling of firearms we\nwant to make sure like many people\ndidn't grow up hunting or grow up with\nFirearms um but they may recognize that\nthey live in a dangerous area a\ndangerous situation and they want to\nhave the ability to protect themselves\ntheir children and their families so\nthat's important so this bill allows you\nto use part of your $300 tax credit if\nyou want to to get a a safe handling\ninstructional course um we want them to\nbe able to protect their families and\ntheir children these are typically about\n$1\n$150 uh their in-person courses uh the\nsecond option on this bill which you can\ndo both is is to obtain a a firearm\nsecure storage device now remember 60%\nover 60% are homicides many of those are\nstolen as I mentioned tragically another\n30% are suicides and about 10% are\naccidental and these are these are in\nyouth 19 and under um this bill offers\nchoices to families parents firearm\nowners you can get a bedside gun safe\nwith biometric digital access for about\n$100 or you can get Trigger or cable\nlocks this is an example of a little\nquick combination lock that can disable\nmost any handgun and almost all long\nguns as far shotguns rifles as well um\nso this bill offers uh choices ways to\nsecure your Firearms especially when you\nhave children or maybe neighborhood\nchildren come to visit that weren't\ntrained like maybe you train your own\nchildren um Grand grandparents that may\nnot think about this and then of course\nwe got troubled teens that's almost a\nredundant to say that because all of us\nwere somewhat troubled when we were\nteenagers but but it's a challenge and\nit is and occasionally gets to the level\nof a tragedy securely storing your\nFirearms is certainly a responsible\naction um\nit can be something that can uh\navoid tragedy importantly in this bill\nwe did put some guardrails around this\nwe want to make sure that I mean the\nBill of Rights is important to all of us\nand the second one of those Bill of\nRights is the Second Amendment the right\nto protect yourself and your family so\nwe want to make sure by making this bill\nis voluntary it has no threats of\ncriminal action or whatever it has a\nProhibition specific prohibition for any\nlist that's not needed just to\nadminister the program\nuh and so we have put some guardrails\naround it that I think are respectful of\nyour Bill of Rights your second\namendment rights but also allows\nresponsible gun owners the option that\nthey need the choices that they need I\nthink House Bill 79 can both inform the\npublic and encourage them to utilize\nboth Safe Handling and safe storage of\nfirearms and I hope I can get your\nsupport uh as we try to move forward\nwith this bill Mr Speaker I'm glad to\nanswer any questions gentleman's going\nto answer some question question we have\num five folks who want to uh speak in\nfavor of the bill and we do have a\ncouple of questions I'm going to\nrecognize representative\nhering to your left for question\nrepresentative thank you Mr Speaker does\nthe gentleman yield\ncertainly is it not true that promoting\nsecure firearm storage through tax\nincentives will help prevent accidental\nshootings especially among children and\nteenagers in Georgia absolutely the lady\nknows of what she speak it is it is true\naccidental they about 10% and the others\nare suicide 30% and 60 over 60%\nhomicides but thank you so much thank\nyou for your support representative\nKelly to your left has recognized for a\nquestion thank you Mr Speaker with the\ngentleman yel sure chairman Newton uh\njust to clear a few things up isn't it\ntrue that there's nothing mandatory in\nthis legislation that would require\nanyone to do this no it's Absolut\nabsolutely true this is number one it's\na number completely voluntary program\nthere are prohibitions on a registry or\nlist in the bill but once again it's\nit's an optional program it may not be\nright for everyone but we want to both\neducate and inform and encourage the use\nof a\nresponsible Secure Storage and isn't it\nfurther true that I love guns so much\nthat I'm going to use this tax credit to\nbuy uh lock box for my Tahoe so that\nwhen my car gets broken to broken into\nin Atlanta no one will take my guns out\nof it that's a that's I'm excited to see\nthat there are beginning to be a lot of\nU vehicle safes that are biometric for\nthe people who are driving an area where\nthey feel they need protection but at\nthe same time um stolen guns out of\nvehicles is probably the leading weapon\nused in Gang Related violence and those\n60% over 60% of homicides that I\nmentioned and so that's going to be a\ngreat choice if you make\nit representive for Ana Jones to your\nleft has recognized for a\nquestion thank you speaker does the Gent\nyeld yes ma'am as a gun license holder\nand a responsible gun owner I would like\nto express my gratitude for this bill\nfor I lost a cousin because a firearm\nwas not safely secured is it not true\nthat house bill 79 does not impose any\nrestrictions on gun ownership but\ninstead promotes responsible firearm\nstorage and handling which benefits all\nGeorgians I thank the lady thank you\nvery much for the question she's\nabsolutely right I look forward to to\nmoving forward on this gentleman has no\nfurther questions well thank you Mr\nSpeaker I hope that we can uh we can\ntake a step forward and and continue to\ndo things to protect and strengthen our\nchildren and families I appreciate your\nsupport on the bill gentleman yield of\nthe\nwell we have five speakers in favor I'm\ngoing to give y'all up to individually s\nminutes if you don't need it don't take\nit but up to seven minutes I'm going to\nstart with representative Al Dr Al\nyou're recognized to speak to the bill\ngive the lady your attention\nplease thank you Mr\nSpeaker today I Rise Again to speak in\nsupport of a bill that incentivizes\nresponsible firearm ownership and the\nSecure Storage of guns I was pleased to\nco-sponsor this bill last year when it\npassed near unanimously out of the house\nand I hope in a few minutes we'll have a\nchance to pass it again with just as\nmuch\nsupport I appreciate the good doctor\nfrom Augusta for again sponsoring this\nbill and I appreciate the support that\nRepublican leadership has put behind it\nindicating that not only does Secure\nStorage work to keep our families safer\nsafe storage is a gun safety measure\nwe're willing to put some muscle\nbehind when we pass this bill today we\ncan all go home knowing that we did\nsomething good but since I might not get\nanother chance to do\nthis I'm going to walk you through some\nhypotheticals so what if we passed a\nbill offering families vouchers for\nbuying car seats but we did not also\nhave a law requiring car seat use for\nbabies and\nchildren what if we passed the bill\ninstructing car insurance companies to\noffer lower premiums for drivers with\nclean records but we didn't also have\nspeed limits or DUI\nlaws what if we passed the bill offering\ntax credits for swimming lessons and\nwater safety courses but did not also\nrequire safety fences around public and\nprivate swimming pools in those cases I\nthink we can recognize how despite all\nthe good intentions incentives alone do\nnot work nearly as well as incentives\ncoupled with\nregulation so I want to be clear here\nthe current bill we are debating HB 79\nincludes no such requirements Okay this\nmay in fact be the key selling point for\nmany so I really want to underline this\npoint to ensure this bill's passage hb7\ndoes not require any gun owner to do\nanything this Omission in my opinion\nalso highlights the opportunity that\nthis body has missed year after year\nafter year and I want to urge us to not\nmiss this opportunity again gun violence\nas Dr Newton noted is the number one\ncause of death of kids and teenagers in\nthis country and there's really no way\naround this next thing I'm going to say\nwhich is that a safe storage law is the\nmost effective way to keep guns out of\nthe hands of unsupervised minors this\nmay be An Inconvenient Truth uh but\namong friends like ourselves we need to\nbe honest right we've had a chance to do\nbetter and we have chosen to not do\nso yet a few important things that I\nwant to point out right now many other\nsimilar proun States like Florida like\nTexas have stronger safe storage\nrequirements than Georgia\ndoes yes I said Florida and Texas have\nstronger safe storage laws than we do if\nthey can do it so can we we can respect\nand embrace the Second Amendment even\nwith\nregulation in 2020 the American Bar\nAssociation noted and I quote from their\npaper safe storage laws are a\nconstitutional means to protect the\npublic from preventable SU hides tragic\naccidents and crime while respecting\nAmerican second amendment\nrights and in 2024 just last year our\ncurrent conservative Supreme Court also\nruled 8:1 in favor of a bill limiting\ncertain people's access to guns\nindicating that the Second Amendment\nrights can exist with limits Chief\nJustice John Roberts wrote quote since\nthe founding our nation's firearm laws\nhave included Provisions preventing\nindividuals who threaten physical harm\nto others from misusing\nFirearms so we we can pass a safe\nstorage law if we choose to and I know\nbehind Clos doors because I've had this\nconversation for many many years many of\nyou understand that we should pass a law\nlike\nthis so this past September appalachi\nhigh\nschool was the site of the deadliest\nschool shooting in Georgia's history the\nshooter in that case was only 14 years\nold this of course was shocking but what\nshocked me more was that hearing that\njust a year prior to that Massacre he\nand his father had been questioned by\nlocal police on suspicion that he might\ndo something exactly like this so as\npart of this questioning police asked\nthe father about the then 13-year-olds\naccess to Firearms right police were\ntold that yes there were in fact guns in\nthe home that they used for hunting but\nthat ammunition was out of the boy's\nReach This encounter took place in\n2023 now imagine imagine had we passed a\nsafe storage requirement earlier that\nsame year and we did have a chance to do\nso ask me how I\nknow how might that have changed things\nwell so the police questioning the\nfather could have said then did you know\nthat Georgia just passed a law requiring\nthat guns be accessed guns that can be\naccessed by miners be locked up\nsecurely are the guns in your home\nstored securely so that your son can't\naccess them without\nsupervision can you show\nus nothing should haunt us more in this\nchamber than a missed\nopportunity and nothing should shame us\nmore than failing to learn from our\nmistakes we don't have to miss this\nopportunity again we have a chance to do\nthis now this year and to do the right\nthing\nso should we pass this bill\nh79 absolutely 100% I will be voting yes\nand I urge everyone in this chamber to\nvote Yes\ntoo I also urge you to push yourselves a\nlittle bit more even though it's hard\nyou know we often commend the staff and\nthe students and the families and the\nteachers after school shooting for being\nbrave right and they\nare but we can be brave\ntoo right so as we pass HP 79 let's\ncommit to close that Loop incentivize\nresponsible behavior while creating a\ncult\nand an expectation of exactly what that\nresponsible behavior should look\nlike here and vote on\nhb1 the Pediatric Health safe storage\nact you've had a lot of time it's the\nfirst bill that was dropped this session\nwe still have a little bit of time to do\nit you may disagree with hb1 right you\nmay ultimately vote no on it and that's\nthat's okay right that's how the\nDemocratic process works but at least\ngive the issue issue the respect it\ndeserves and don't go home today after\npassing this current bill HB 79 patting\nyourselves on the back and thinking that\nwe've done enough we have not done\nenough so don't walk away from that\nresponsibility because that is why we\nare here thank you Mr Speaker I yield\nThe\nWell the lady has yielded the well\nrepresentative Oliver recognize speak to\nthe bill\nthank you Mr Speaker I'm grateful for\nthis opportunity today one of the\nbenefits of a long political career is\nthat you have an opportunity to learn\nthings over time to look at Trends to\nlook at changes in the law how they came\nquickly or not so quickly you have the\nopportunity to experience as I have\nserving both in the majority party with\nleadership roles and in the minority\nparty without leadership\nroles I want to make an argument to you\nbriefly today certainly less than seven\nminutes that the gun safety legislation\nin my long political career has been the\nmost partisan the most\nintransient and with devastating\nresults I have followed these issues\nvery closely I have been involved in\nmany different uh efforts to make gun\nsafety legislation more meaningful and I\nwant to give you some examples of this\nhistory and some examples what's\nmeaningful to me of what true\nbipartisanship is I have benefited from\nbip bipartisan efforts very much I have\nappreciated the opportunity to serve\nprimarily um in the Judiciary Committee\nwhere there is an opportunity for shared\nviews real bipartisanship is based on an\nopen mind an intellectual honesty and\nmutual respect I learned those skills\nhad to learn those skills as a young\nlawyer in rural Georgia in many\ndifferent court systems the judge was\nalways in charge of my opposing\ncouncil's Behavior not me it didn't\nmatter where my opposing Council was\nreally bad showed up drunk slept during\nthe trial and knew less about the law\nand my hound dog Henry he is somebody I\nwas required to respect because only the\njudge was in charge of my opponent's\nBehavior not myself that gave me some\nreasons to believe coming down here that\nintellectual\nhonesty open mind and mutual respect\nwould be opportunities I could enjoy and\nI have enjoyed many of those David\nRoston and I came to the Senate on the\nsame day he he was on a committee I\nchaired he came to the committee every\nday and for six years we worked together\nwe both ran for a Statewide office we\nboth lost we both went home to our law\noffices and then we came back I've had a\nhouse in his district for 25 years and I\nreally missed him this week because I\nwanted to tell him that we have a bald\neagle on fighting Town Creek and I\nenjoyed sharing that with representative\nChastain here are the bills that we have\nnot enjoyed a bipartisan positive\nopportunity about that we should pass in\nthe issue of gun\nsafety red flag laws would prevent\ndeaths waiting periods would prevent\ndeaths not abolishing mental health\nrecords after 5 years as we do in\nGeorgia uniquely would prevent death\nbackground checks would prevent\ndeaths I served as a magistrate court\njudge for several years I was at the\njail on Friday night regularly I saw the\nsignificant impact of gun violence we\nlive in a gun violence society and\nladies and gentlemen it's gotten\nworse I will vote\n4.79 the tax credit benefit if I were to\nbuy was what is uh Amazon's most uh\nfavored gun safety would save me about\n$15 I think but I'm going to vote for it\nbecause it\nrepresents a little bit of change but\nI'm going to urge you in an effort to\npromote uh intellectual honesty and open\nmindness to let's follow the advice of\npeople like Warren Buffett and many\nothers that say we can educate ourselves\nno matter how old we are we need to\nconcentrate every week five hours of\nreading or a book every week I want to\nrecommend to you this is a little bit\nmore gratuitous advice that you read the\nAmerican Gun the true story of the\nAR-15 written by a Wall Street Journal\nreporter on the history of the\nAR-15 came out of the World War II\nefforts to improve guns to make safety a\nhigher priority for our\nsoldiers we need to understand more that\nwe have failed in the area of gun safety\nwe need to be more\nopen-minded and we need to pay attention\nplease pay attention to the reality that\nthe number one cause of death today for\nchildren is gun violence thank you Mr\nSpeaker I yield the well\nthank you the ladies are yielded the\nwell representative Roberts has\nrecognized speak to the bill up to 7\nminutes thank you Mr\nSpeaker today I rise in support of h79\nbecause I think we all can agree putting\na few tax dollars back in georg's\npockets for doing the right thing is\nalways a good thing and encouraging\ninvestment in safe storage is a step in\nthe right\ndirection that said I do hope it's not\nthe only step this body takes this\nsession and in the future because\nGeorgia is now fourth in the country for\nweakest gun laws and\ncorrespondingly has the fourth highest\nnumber of gun deaths per year we should\nall want to improve those\nnumbers especially when we recently\nexperienced what might have been a\nventable school shooting very close to\nhome right up the road in Winder Georgia\ntwo teachers and two students gunned\ndown by a\n14-year-old who was on law enforcement's\nradar known by his family to be a risk\nand had access to\nFirearms family members of the victims\nand survivors from from the appalache\nhigh school shooting have been at the\ncapital this\nsession I hope you all took time to\nlisten to their stories since you're not\nlistening to\nme one high school student School senior\nshared her story while she was\nhere she said and I quote the shooting\nstarted the minutes that followed would\nfeel like a\neternity in that moment I felt\nresponsible I still do many of us do I\nsat there Frozen terrified unable to\nmove unable to help if I had moved had\ntried I might have been\nnext let that settle for a minute a math\nteacher who was in the classroom next\ndoor to where the shooter killed the\nvictims recently shared with our caucus\nthat she is now suffering from PTSD and\ntwo days ago I know y'all are football\nfans Mike Hancock resigned as football\ncoach at appalache citing PTSD anxiety\ngrief and depression because one of\nthose killed was Richard aspenwall his\ndefensive\ncoordinator this session I have watched\nmany of you come to this\nwell pleading passionately and tearfully\nand I've cried from my chair with you\nsome of you have said you need us to\nvote Yes even though we can't understand\nbecause we haven't lived what you've\nlived through you're right I have not\nlived through a hurricane but I voted\nwith you I have not watched my child\nsuffer from a rare disease and I hope\nnone of us do but I voted with you\nevery year we have citizens from All\nOver Georgia come down to this capital\nand tearfully plead with you to pass\nCommon Sense gun safety legislation\nparents whose children died accidentally\nor committed suicide with a gun that was\nnot properly stored a\nSurvivor who has been in this capital in\nher wheelchair because her abusive\nspouse came after her and shot her\nmultiple times and families of victims\nwho lost L loved ones at the hand of\nSchool shooters who projected their\nintentions to others in advance of the\ntragedy instead of passing policies that\nmight prevent these tragic deaths some\nof you avoid the Rope line when the red\nshirts are in the capital and you won't\neven grant us a Comm Committee hearing\nwith a vote on the bills we file for\nthese grieving and scared\nGeorgians we know that none of these\nbills by themselves will prevent every G\ngun death but our constituents deserve\nfor us to try some of these policies we\nknow are working in other\nstates after the tragic Parkland\nshooting Florida Citizens pleaded with\nthe state legislature to pass Common\nSense gun safety bills and they did they\npassed a red flag bill they raised the\nage of who can own a gun and they\nrequired a mandatory waiting period a\nfew a few years later in response to an\nattempt to repeal that red flag law a\nBroward County Sheriff who was a self-\nproclaimed Law and Order\nconservative I remember the first time I\nshadowed somebody before I decided to\nrun for office and I have done politics\nin county and cities as a zoning\nattorney I was shocked at how rude this\nchamber is to talk when somebody's in\nthis\nwell I haven't talked when you been\ncrying from up here about your\nconstituents who are hurting and I would\nappreciate the same\nrespect that sheriff shared in an\narticle that he believed the red law\nflag laws were working he said he was\nable to stop tragedies before they\nhappened rather than just respond\nafterwards we've now had a tragic school\nshooting right here at home Georgians\nare suffering and pleading for us to do\nsomething HB 79 is a start but what's it\ngoing to take before this body will\nanswer the call of 80% of Georgians who\nsupport more impactful common sense\nSolutions respectfully a school safety\nbill that doesn't require safe storage\nis\nincomplete this issue should not be\npartisan bullets don't pick Democrats\nand Republicans the bills my colleagues\nand I file to try and address gun\nviolence are as important to us as yours\nproviding Hurricane Relief rather than\nreciprocate the empathy we show you you\nignore us year after year and then you\nclaim this issue this more innocuous\nbill as your own to claim credit for one\nof the first gun safety bills in more\nthan a\ndecade step too far many of you often\nsay to us in the minority party how\nhappy you are that we can disagree and\nstill be respectful of each other let me\nbe clear we respect this chamber and the\nhonor of this office we all hold but it\nhurts us deeply when you disregard our\npassionate pleas I will continue to vote\non your legislation with empathy and I\nwill vote Yes on this bill but we as\nmembers of this house deserve better and\nGeorgia families deserve\nmore memb yielded the will\nrepresentative Carter is recognized to\npresent the bill I get to present a bill\nyeah I guess you could speak to the\nbill you know what I\nmeant lady will speak to the bill good\nafternoon everyone I first want to let\nyou know that I have come in support of\nh79 I love the fact that we have a piece\nof legislation that is promoting uh not\nonly safety but\ntraining if if you're going to own a gun\nif you're going to own a firearm you\nneed to be trained a lot of us did not\ngrow up with guns but they've become\npopular the children want them the\nadults want them everybody wants them so\nthis piece of legislation will also\nprovide a tax credit for\ntraining we've talked a lot about the\nshooting but here's another reason why\nit's important that the training is\nincluded can you\nimagine\nmoms having your firearm in your\npurse you leave your purse in the car\nyou run in the store and come back and\nyour child has shot themselves because\nthey were rumbling in your\npurse well you know what if that Mom or\nthat cousin or that father or whoever\ndid that had firearm training maybe that\nchild would have lived so I hope when we\npass this piece of legislation that we\nwill will promote it we'll go out and\nencourage our is constituents to ensure\nthat they not only safe uh safely store\ntheir guns but get training because\nhere's the thing training ensures that\ngun owners are educated on responsible\npractices for handling and using\nFirearms storing them securely in your\nhome in your vehicle and I'm going to\nsay ladies in your purse\nis critical it's common sense and before\nusing a gun you should receive\ntraining gun owners can make their homes\nand communities safer by storing their\nguns securely this means storing them\nunloaded locked and separate from\nammunition research shows Secure Storage\npractice practices play a vital role in\nreducing risk of gun violence storing\nfirearms securely protects children and\nadults and prevented and prevented\nunintentional\nshootings you may not know this or you\nmay know this an estimate 54% of gun\nowners do not lock their guns\nsecurely\n54% every year nearly 360 children under\nthe age of 18 unintentionally shoot\nthemselves are someone\nelse 4.6 million children in the US live\nin a home with at least one unlocked and\nloaded\nfirearm guys if we don't do anything\nelse with gun safety this\nsession passing this piece of\nlegislation and offering a credit is a\ngood step because if we can get people\nto be trained to use their firearms and\nstore them safely I believe that we

relating to Elementary\nand secondary education cies for the\nsafety health and well-being of students\nand school communities this bill I refer\nto the committee on education that\ncommittee recommends that this bill do\npass by rules committee substitute\nmembers this house bill 268 is the first\nbill on our supplemental calendar we\nhave a a couple bills to hear this\nafternoon so hope you'll give the folks\nin the in the well your attention\nas we move forward through the afternoon\nso we'll begin with House Bill 268\nrepresentative Hol peringer is\nrecognized to present the bill\nrepresentative\nPinger thank you Mr Speaker good\nafternoon colleagues I rise today to\npresent for your favorable consideration\nHouse Bill\n268 but before I cover the contents of\nthis legislation I want to present each\nof you with the opportunity this bill\nrepresents\nthis legislation represents an\nopportunity to pass measures today that\nwill save lives and protect our students\nteachers and schools in every corner of\nthis\nstate this bill will put in place\nproactive early intervention measures\nthat support the mental health and\nwell-being of our children and provide\nresources for students in crisis\nensuring that we can intervene to make a\nmeaningful impact on an individual\nbefore A Mental Health crisis escalates\nto self harm or the harm of other\nstudents I urge you to keep that in mind\nas you consider this\nmeasure last September the bar County\ncommunity in our en entire State\nwitnessed an unimaginable tragedy when\nfour GE Georgians were taken from us\nduring a Despicable and senseless act of\nviolence those Four Georgians were\n14-year-old students Mason skir Horn\nChristian\nAngulo beloved math and dance teacher\nChristina iry and Coach Richard\naspenwall\nafter this tragedy speaker Burns along\nwith the members of this house committed\nthe championing of legislation that\nbolster school security mandate stronger\ncommunication between our schools state\nagencies and law enforcement and\nprovides critical Mental Health\nResources to our students that's exactly\nwhat HB 268 will\naccomplish first HB 268 creates\nincreased Mental Health Resources for\nstudents in every Public School District\nacross the\nstate these resources include new\npositions Behavioral Health coordinators\nin our systems as well as grants to fund\nthese\npositions secondly this legislation\naddresses several critical needs to\nstrengthen school security and filling\ngaps and communication that were\nrevealed following the events at\nappalache high\nschool HB 268 requires relevant student\nrecords including academic and\ndisciplinary records to be shared\nquickly and efficiently when a student\ntransfers between school districts we\nknow that a lack of information sharing\noccurred with the accused shooter at\nappalache and this measure measure\ndirectly addresses that breakdown in\ncommunication third HB 268 will require\na structured multi-disciplinary process\nto identify assess and mitigate\npotential threats while supporting the\nsafety and well-being of students and\nstaff this includes requiring schools to\nadopt behavioral threat assessment\nmanagement teams also called bams to\nidentify and manage potential threats at\nthe school\nlevel gima will also expand their\nStatewide behavioral threat management\noperational process to provide technical\nassistance and training to local school\nsystems helping them develop and\nImplement effective threat management\nteams and\npolicies this will help ensure that\nstudents who may be facing a mental\nhealth crisis receive the resources and\nsupport they need when they need it\nmost next to continue fostering inter\nagency communication and communication\nbetween school districts HB 268 creates\na Statewide information sharing system\nthat is used to collect integrate and\nanalyze data related to threats against\nschool safety the school and student\nsafety database are\nS3 this includes the incident records of\nstudents who have made a threat or engag\nin other threatening or criminal\nbehavior that members of a school's bam\nteam\ndeems Rises to a standard that would\ninitiate entrance into the S3\ndatabase I want to be very clear not\nevery student in our state will have an\nS3 data record in fact the vast majority\nof students will never have a record in\nthe S3 database\nBas S3 would also meet the highest\nsecurity standards and only individuals\non local bam teams and designated school\nand GMA Personnel would have access to\nthe S3 student record parents can also\nrequest to review this data at any\ntime next we know that students feel\ncomfortable in safe sharing information\nand voicing concerns on their devices\nthat's why HP 268 requires schools to\nadopt the use of an anonymous reporting\napp that meets certain standards\nfinally this bill increases the penalty\nfor terric threats and requires the\nimmediate removal and placement in\nonline learning of a student who makes a\nterroristic threat until law enforcement\nand the BAM team deem it safe for that\nindividual to return to\nschool this approach balances the\nimmediate need to secure the safety of\nother students while providing an\nopportunity for the student who made the\nthreat to be assessed and received the\nresources they may\nneed colleagues HB 268 is a result of\nmonths of collaboration between me of\nthis house state agencies Law\nEnforcement Officers Educators School\nadministrators and parents whose number\none concern is the safety of our\nstudents I will once again reiterate\nthis bill and the resources it creates\nwill save lives we have an opportunity\ntoday to change the narrative\nsurrounding mental health put in place\nmeasures that will have positive\nlifelong impact on Georgia's children\nand take proactive steps to ensure a\ntragedy like what happened at appalachi\nhigh school never happens again in our\nstate\nI'm honored to stand before you today\nand ask for your favorable consideration\nof House Bill\n268 Mr Speaker I'll yield the well if\nthere are no questions there is a\nquestion uh chair recognizes\nrepresentative Clark for a\nquestion to your\nleft thank you madam speaker does a\ngentleman yield I do so I received a lot\na lot of emails about this bill and one\nof the concerns that I received from a\nlot of parents was about the privacy of\nthe information that is being shared um\nyou know across these schools um I\ndidn't hear you really speak on the\nPrivacy part could you expound on how\nwe're making sure that this data is not\ngoing to get into the hands of people\nwho necessarily shouldn't see this data\nsure so all all the data records are um\nunder Hippa and furpa compliance and not\nevery person in a school system is going\nto have access to all the records it's\non a need to know so you're only going\nto have access to a student's records if\nyou're their classroom teacher or an\nadministrator somebody directly involved\nin the education of that child and does\nthe gentleman further you I do um what\nabout um students that have like a 504\nplan or an IEP um for um disciplinary or\nmental health um issues um how are we\nmaking sure that um they are I guess not\nnecessarily being labeled as the quote\nbad kid corre because of something that\nmight actually be diagnosed so thanks to\nrepresentative glaze we've had we mitted\nthe billing committee to directly\naddress that so similar to if they have\na behavioral issue now they have a man\nmanifestation meeting so in the ban\nmeeting if a child with a 504 or an IEP\nwere to be referred to the B Tam team\nsomeone um intimately involved in in\ncreating their 504 or IEP will be um a\nmember of that Team all right thank you\nvery much thank you the chair recognizes\nthe majority leader of stration for a\nquestion thank you madam speaker the\ngentleman yiel I do sir is it not true\nthat this legislation will provide local\nschool systems with the necessary\nresources and guidance to effectively\nmanage and mitigate potential threats\nthat's absolutely correct thank you for\nbringing the bill sir thank you there\nare no more\nquestions I yield the well gentleman has\nyielded the well the chair\nrecognizes representative\nMcQueen uh to speak to the\nbill okay at the speaker's discretion\nthe opposition will have 15 minutes\ntotal as will uh those speaking in favor\nof the bill\nthank you madam speaker colleagues I\nrise today to confess that I have read\nthis bill more than I've read any bill\nthis session I approach reading bills\nthe same way I teach my students to\napproach a complex test or assessment I\nread every bill at least three times\neach with a different purpose round one\nis for feelings with some of the\nlegislation we've seen this year that's\na necessary step for me I read the words\nI feel what I feel and I move on round\ntwo is for facts what is actually here\nwhat is this bill saying and just as\nimportant what is it not saying and\nfinally round three is for questions\nwhere are the gaps what doesn't add up\nnow usually that third reading wraps\nthings up maybe a fourth pass at most\nbut with House Bill 268 I lost count\nbecause the more I read the more\nquestions I had and the first question\nwas simple what what exactly are we\ndoing here we are being asked to create\na statun student surveillance database a\nwatch list for children readily\navailable for law enforcement access the\ntalking points meant to be reassuring\nare this isn't a watch list it's just a\nsafety tool we track attendance we track\ngrades why not this because this is\ndifferent this isn't neutral\ndata this is subjective labeling\ndeciding which children are considered a\nthreat Based On A Feeling a perception a\njudgment so then I wonder well who makes\nthat call and once a child is flagged\nhow long does that label follow them\ndoes a 10-year-old who gets written up\nfor acting out at fifth grade recess\nstay in this system until they're 18\napplying for college when they apply for\na job I went back to the bill looking\nfor guard rails looking for limits\nlooking for Clear criteria to answer\nthose basic questions and while the\nsupplement to this bill now includes an\nappeal process a path for parents to\nchallenge a recommendation to the school\nlevel behavioral threat assessment\nmanagement team\nbam what happens to the students who\ndon't have someone to make that appeal\nwhat about students in foster care the\nstudents whose Guardians are absent or\nunavailable the students navigating the\nsystem alone because an appeal process\non paper means nothing if there's no one\nto file it and I looked for language\nthat accounted for them protections for\nstudents without Advocates alternative\nsafeguards to make sure no child slips\nthrough the cracks and unfortunately I\nfound nothing and so then I thought well\nsurely there must be strict controls on\nwho can see this information because if\nwe're creating a list like this the\nfirst concern has to be privacy so I\nwent to the bill looking for answers\nlooking for Clear en forcable limits on\nwho can access this database on how the\ninformation is shared and on how long a\nstudent's name can stay in the system\nand and I found in lines 136 through 138\nof the original that quote any sharing\nof Student Records shall comply with the\nfederal family education rights and\nPrivacy Act furpa and it's implementing\nregulations in quote and that's it and\nthe concern here is that furpa has broad\nexceptions especially when safety is\ninvoked under furpa if a school official\nbelieves there's a threat they can share\nthey can share personally identifiable\ninformation from Student Records without\nparental consent and with nearly any\noutside party they claim has a\nlegitimate educational interest so under\nthis bill once a child is flagged what's\nstopping that information from\ncirculating between schools law\nenforcement state agencies and Beyond so\nI kept looking I searched for any extra\nguard rails this bill might put in place\nlimits Beyond furpa clear restrictions\nto prevent overreach or use I looked for\nlanguage that says who exactly can see\nthis information I looked for language\nthat says how long this data stays on\nfile and again I found nothing so now\nI'm wondering why do we even need this\nbecause here's the thing we already have\ninformation sharing tools between\nschools and law enforcement right now\nunder existing Georgia law if there's a\ncredible threat schools are fully\nempowered to notify authorities\ncoordinate responses and share necessary\nrecords to Pro to protect students and\nstaff and even when considering that in\nmany rural areas information sharing\nmight not be happening as smoothly as it\nshould that some districts May lack the\nPersonnel technology or relationships to\ncoordinate effectively the question\nbecomes whether this bill fixes these\nissues does this bill fund training to\nstrengthen Partnerships between school\nand law enforcement does it provide\nresources for Rural districts to develop\ncommunication plans does it offer grants\nto improve existing systems rather than\nforcing every District into a one- siiz\nfits-all state database I went looking\nfor those answers in the bill and once\nagain I found nothing no new protections\nno new powers no new resources just\nanother layer another government system\nanother database to maintain with all\nthe risk that comes with collecting\nsensitive data on children and none of\nthe benefit so even if we accept the\npremise that some districts need help\ncoordinating School safety responses\nthis bill does not address that problem\nit does not provide a solution it just\nbuilds a new system on top of the gaps\nthat already exist without actually\nclosing them so if the information is\nalready flowing where it needs to in\nmost areas and if this bill does nothing\nto improve coordination where it isn't\nthen why are we building this machine\nand who's paying for all of this because\nwe know this isn't free the technology\nthe training the maintenance the\nsecurity and yes school safety is worth\nthe cost we could find the money later\nand schools could just get started now\nbut we've heard that promise before and\nit's always the schools with the fewest\nresources who are asked to stretch the\nfurthest so I looked in the bill for\nfunding streams for grants for\nAppropriations for anything that\nacknowledges the cost we're dumping on\nthese districts and again nothing so\nwhen I went looking in the bill for the\noversight where is the back stop to\nensure this system isn't misused there\nare references to the Chief privacy\nofficer in lines 126 through 130 of the\noriginal but does the CPO have\nindependent Authority can they stop\nmisuse remove false entries protect\nstudents in real time yet again nothing\nto be found the Chief privacy officer\nadvises they consult but they do not\ncontrol this system they do not have the\npower to intervene when a student is\nwrongfully flagged they do not protect\nthese children from the consequences of\na label that may follow them\nindefinitely and all of this brought me\nto my one last question what happened to\nlocal control we hear about it\nconstantly in this chamber the wisdom of\nletting parents and local Educators make\nthe decisions closest to their students\nand yet here we are voting on a bill\nthat creates a one-size fits all\nStatewide mandate that forces every\nDistrict into the same system whether it\nworks for their students or not school\nsafety requires consistency but safety\ndoes not mean sacrificing local wisdom\nit does not mean stacking one system on\ntop of another and pretending that's\nprogress so colleagues I ask you this if\nthis bill does not protect privacy if it\ndoes not provide funding if it does not\nrespect local control and if it\nduplicates work that schools and law\nenforcement are already doing then what\nare we doing if the goal is real safety\nlet's fund the people who do the real\nwork let's hire more counselors more\nsocial workers let's invest in mental\nhealth care and conflict resolution but\nif the goal is simply to say we did\nsomething regardless of whether it truly\nworks then let's at least be honest\nabout that and to be clear I want to\nrecognize the work of the sponsor and\nthe committee I see the efforts to\nrespond to concerns raised about the\noriginal bill I see the Amendments I see\nthe attempt to build in some guard rails\nand I appreciate those steps but\ncolleagues there is so much more work to\ndo so I strongly urge you to consider\neverything I've laid out here as you\nmake your vote thank you speaker I a\nyield the well ladies yielded the will\nrepresentative Sanchez is recognized to\nspeak to the bill represent\nSanchez thank you Mr\nSpeaker I stand here today to oppose\nHouse Bill 268 not because I don't\nsupport the intent of helping our\nstudents in keeping them safe it's\nbecause I want to keep our kids safe\nthat I am opposing this\nbill as of one only two genz legislators\nhere and as someone who was in high\nschool in the last decade I have\nexperience what it's like to go to\nschool in the modern environment of mass\nshootings and the fears and anxieties\nthat that comes\nwith there are many things to speak up\non this bill including some things that\nin isolation I would\nsupport but of the over 60 Pages there\nisn't nearly enough on mental health and\nthere's too much on surveillance\novercriminalization and the invasion of\nprivacy of our students and their\nfamilies testimony was heard in\ncommittee from multiple parents who are\nafraid of what this bill could do to\ntheir children parents whose children\nhave already had to face racial\ndiscrimination in our schools some\nstudents have been labeled terrorists\nand bared for participating in student\nelections simply because a principal did\nnot understand a movie reference another\nstudent was simply discussing guns and\nhad to be suspended for 3 Days to\nappease racial animosity from other\nparents this bill will exacerbate cases\nlike this where ignorance man\nmisunderstandings and straight up\nPrejudice cause students to be punished\nfor doing nothing wrong this bill\nrequires records of disciplinary actions\nto follow students wherever they go even\nif they're not criminal actions it is\nalso makes it much easier for law\nenforcement in the government to have\naccess to these records and undermine\nparents rights to deny such requests\neven despite some of the Amendments\nmade as the Intercultural development\nresearch Association has noted\ndiscipline is very often conflated with\nsecurity the records being referenced in\nthis bill are discipline records not\nsecurity risk\nrecords and they are using these\ndiscipline records to label children as\nthreats we're talking about children as\nthreats idra states that the existing\ndisparities in school discipline\nprocesses and systems across the state\nmean that right now black children are\nthree times more likely than their white\npeers to be disciplined in Georgia\nPublic Schools even though black\nstudents are not more likely to\nmisbehave additionally students with\ndisabilities are one and a half times\nmore likely to be punished we cannot\nallow these unjust disparities to turn\ninto a permanent setback for students\nthrough the system this bill is trying\nto create and if I may I'd like to share\na personal story about my time in school\nin 2008 the recession made my family\nlose everything and we had to move to a\ncompletely different community and shove\nourselves into a small\napartment with a family of five it was a\nhard year for us and for me and in that\nyear I got into three fights at the new\nschool that I was in and I got written\nup for them mind you I was a straight A\nstudent and a year later I was in\nstudent\ngovernment but what would have happened\nif this bill was enacted\nthen what would have how would that have\nimpacted how my teachers viewed me or\nthe opportunities that I would have\nreceived\nbetween fourth and 10th grade I went to\nsix different\nschools and if this bill was enacted\nthen that record would have followed me\nthrough those\nschools why are we essentially creating\na criminal record for\nstudents you know what that would do to\nstudents who are struggling to better\nthemselves a study demonstrated multiple\nStudies have demonstrated the bias that\nhappens from Educators and they showed\nthat Educators that perceive students as\nlower performing treat those students\ndifferently than they do who students\nwho they perceive to be higher\nperforming to the detriment of those\nlower performing\nstudents so what do you think this bill\nwill do if you see a student who has a\nessentially criminal record attached to\nthem through this S3\ndatabase what do you think will happen\nto students who have one bad day follow\nthem for the rest of their educational\nlife we should not punish children who\nhaven't even committed a\ncrime this will disproportionately\nimpact students from working families\nwho are struggling to get by single\nparents who have to work and can't be as\ninvolved in their children's education\nor both parents who work to make ends\nmeet and as referenced earlier black and\nbrown students are traditionally overp\npoliced and marginalized and will\ndisproportionately be impacted by this\nlegislation this bill unnecessarily\npunishes students who are just trying to\ndo better and makes it even harder for\nthose who are behind to get\nahead and it also does not do nearly\nenough to stop school\nshootings I would speak in support of\nthis bill if it significantly expanded\naccess to mental health Cal\nProfessionals in our schools if it\nlooked as students as human beings that\nthey are instead of trying to\ncriminalize them for things they might\nor might not do in the\nfuture I would support this bill if it\ngave parents the ability and the tools\nto be more involved in their children's\nlives if teachers were given more\nresources in tackling the Mental Health\ncrisis if they were paid more for that\nwork if this bill was investing in\nprograms to help kids to help parents to\nhelp schools to help our\ncommunities I would fully support this\nlegislation but this bill does not do\nnearly enough of this instead of helping\nour students it hurts them it\ncriminalizes them it polies them it\ncurtails their civil rights their rights\nto a safe School environment and their\nrights to\nprivacy it also certainly ignores a\nissue behind the Appalachia school\nshooting which is guns I was 2 years old\nwhen the mass shooting a m High School\nhappened I was also two years old when a\nmonth later the Georgia the Heritage\nHigh School shooting happened in\nGeorgia and now nearly 26 years later\nhardly anything has been done around\nthis issue now I know we just passed the\nlegislation earlier and I am glad that\nwe passed House Bill 79 but we need so\nmuch more to ensure the safety of our\nstudents and of our\ncommunities our students are less safe\nnow guns have become the number one\ncause of death for our children and we\nhave all we've been doing is offering\nthoughts and prayers and bills that\ncriminalize black and brown children\nchildren like me when I was in\nschool so I please urge you to vote no\non this\nlegislation I am a example of someone\nwho would have been considered gentlem\nwe'll wrap up we have another speaker if\nyou don't mind thank you thank you Mr\nSpeaker I yield the well thank you sir I\nappreciate your\naccommodating represent representative\nRoman is recognized to speak to up four\nminutes the L's\nrecognized thank you Mr Speaker\ncolleagues today I rise in opposition to\nthis bill and I take no pleasure in\ndoing\nso when I was in high school\nspecifically when I was in driver ed I\ngot pulled out of class by my teacher\nwho proceeded to interrog me to make\nsure that I and my family was not part\nof any terrorist\norganizations and I kind of laughed it\noff because I didn't know what else to\ndo because you know when you're a kid\nyou don't know your civil rights\nnobody's given you a know your rights\nyou know seminar nobody's taught you the\nlaw nobody's told you how to talk back\nto your teacher that way which I never\nhad problems with it's just in that\nsituation I don't know what to do and I\nkind of laughed at off but I found out\nit was because he'd overheard about\nwhere my family and I come from that was\nit all it took took was for him to\noverhear a conversation by another set\nof students for him to think that I was\na danger to my\nclassmates I didn't have a record I\ndidn't have any trouble in school in\nfact I was one of those students that\nwas so obsessed with getting straight\nAIDS I stayed up all night studying I\nwas in the IB program I graduated I went\nto college and somehow I ended up\nhere and so when we talk about bills\nlike this and you've heard from my other\ncolleagues as well about how we continue\nto think that by further criminalizing\nstudents and further surveilling them\nand and further doing all these things\nthat will somehow fix the problems of\nOur\nGenerations I don't think we will in\nfact I think the more we Harden our\nschools the more we Harden our hearts\nthe more that we continue to perpetuate\nthis lack of trust this lack of care the\nmore that we are unable to address the\nmost fundamental reasons behind child\nneglect the more we are going to see\nthese issues so I don't want to belver\nthe point I just wanted to make sure\nthat you all understood why some of us\nare going to be opposing this piece of\nlegislation it's not because we don't\ncare it's not because we don't want to\nprevent any further tragedies it's not\neven because we don't think that there\naren't any good policies in this bill\nit's just because I know that sometimes\nwe want to rush and make sure we get\nsomething done anything done that we\ninadvertently hurt the most vulnerable\namong us so I hope you will reconsider\nand if not thank you for listening thank\nyou Mr Speaker I yield The Well the lady\nhas yielded the well the chair\nrecognizes speaker Burns to speak to the\nBelt thank you madam\nspeaker members I come before you\ntoday to speak to one of the most\nimportant bills we will consider I\nbelieve the most important bill that we\nwill consider this\nsession the safety of our children\nour school children an obligation that I\nknow each and every one of you in this\nroom takes very very\nseriously first I want to thank the two\ngentlemen and all of you who have worked\non this\nbill representative PR singer I know\nthis is personal to\nyou chairman Irwin thank you for your\ntime your efforts to hear from\neveryone in

and I very much\nrespect their thoughts\naddresses the issues that I've heard\nfrom a lot of different\nsources I believe this bill brings\ncommon sense to school\nsafety the security of our children\nwe're having a great conversation about\nliteracy you can't\nlearn if you're not in a safe and secure\nenvironment that's what we're about\ntoday that's what this effort is about\nyou will be in a few\nmoments given the opportunity to cast\nyour vote again on one of the most\nimpactful piece of legislation that we\nbegin the journey on begin the journey\non and that's on school\nsafety it's not the last time we will\nwork on this\nissue our\nchildren\ndemand that we address this issue\nthanks to this\nbody thanks to the governor thanks to\nthe\nSenate the general assembly has invested\nover aund will invest $150\nmillion into local control for school\nsafety that's a strong commitment\nthank you to the members of this body\nfor standing strong your\ncommitment putting your dollars where\nyour words are ensuring that we uh we\nreach\nout to all of the components of this\nproblem law\nenforcement parents and we've done that\nwe talked to parents from all over this\ncountry that have been been impacted by\nthe tragedies of school\nshootings we visited with the\nparents and law\nenforcement from appalache in Bara\nCounty so we could understand exactly\nhow we should address the\nissue we visited with school\nboards\nsuperintendents administrators from\nevery\nlevel all of them committed to school\nsafety today we have an opportunity to\nbe committed to school\nsafety our children demand no less our\nfuture demands no less\nCommunications sure Communications are\nimportant they're very important when\nthe student transfers into a new\nschool and the receiving school does not\nhave the information on that student not\nan invasion of privacy\nbut just information on how you deal\nwith the all the issues that young\npeople can face today that all people\ncan face there should be no Stigma when\nit comes to mental health issues this\nhouse has been committed and will\ncontinue to be committed to deal with\nmental health issues not only in schools\nbut in our society I'm proud of that and\nI bet y'all are too that effort will be\nno less in our school\nsystems as we allow systems to\ncommunicate again just good old common\nsense to know what issue what the issues\nare and what steps need to be\ntaken I do\nbelieve I do\nbelieve that\nGeorgia and\nGeorgians have a bright future when it\ncomes to\neducation I know that to be the case\nthat\nfuture our\nfuture your children your grandchildren\nmy grandchildren again deserve no less\nto to be able to drop be able to be\ndropped off at school by their parents\nby their\ngrandparents with\ntheity that they will have a safe\nenvironment to learn during the\nday and then to be picked up in be\npicked up when school ends and after\nafternoon this legislation will\nstrengthen our Mental Health Resources\nand our school systems allowing our\nschools to work together provide every\nstudent provide every student and what\nto help meet their needs when it comes\nto issues that may be impacting them at\nhome and in\nschool I\nbelieve this\nlegislation will usher in a new culture\nin our school systems\nwhere where we run\ntowards run towards our children facing\nstruggles whether it be mental health\nbecause we've done that we try to do\nthat but many times we've also run away\nfrom those issues it's time we turn that\naround we provide the resources we're\ndoing that we will do that in our\nbudgetary items would strengthen those\nSchool resources I see friends from all\nover the state that in different levels\nof of school administration\nthat understand these issues they've\nsupported what these gentlemen have put\ntogether what the committee has put\ntogether but we've work so hard\non I believe again it will provide this\nlegislation Pro provide every child in\nthis state with a safe and secure method\nto secure their concerns I truly believe\nthat's the\ncase in addition it will keep Georgia\nstudents safe\nand as members of this\nbody I don't believe we have any higher\nobligation if you will no high no higher\ncalling than to do just that Madam\nspeaker I yield the well the gentleman\nhas yielded the well is any objection to\nthe previous question being ordered the\nchair here's none the previous question\nis ordered the chair recognizes chairman\nIrwin for the Chairman's\ntime thank you madam chair let me first\nbegin today by telling you rarely in\nthis chamber do we get the opportunity\nto save lives this bill gives you the\nopportunity to save lives and we need to\ndo that in today's environment let me\ntell you in my whole career in education\nI've witnessed it not only as a student\nbut as an educator\nhow difficult it is to\nlearn and how much more difficult it is\nto learn if it's not a secure\nenvironment we must secure the\nenvironment of all of our\nschools we must have plans we must be\nprepared then we must move on to\neducating the children to the level that\nwe expect every single day for our\nteachers to\nwork I'm going to ask you to vote Yes on\nthis\nbill to save lives and those lives after\nyou vote on this bill you won't even\nknow you saved it because the team\nstepped\nup and were proactive with the\nsituation and they were able to either\nprevent it or catch it before it got in\nthe door and created the violence\nthat are so often seen within our\nschools\ntoday I'm GNA say it again our students\ndeserve a safe and secure\nenvironment what this bill does because\nI've heard quite a bit about what it\ndoesn't do and who it doesn't look at\nand who maybe they thought it looked at\nbut it assists students with the mental\nhealth and the behavioral health that\nthey need we're putting coordinators in\nthere for the first time in school and\nthey're going to connect kids to\nservices that they need when they're in\ncrisis school systems have been asking\nfor this and they've been paying for it\nfor themselves for years and bringing in\ngroups and bringing in the\nexpertise we're putting together the\nagencies that have the expertise in this\nstate\nto come coordinate with teams work with\nteams to secure that\nenvironment that could be GMA that could\nbe the sheriffs that could be gbi all\nthese groups are not only communicating\nfor the first time together as a team\nbut they're coming in to secure that\nenvironment one most important thing I\nthink this bill\ndoes it provides for the transfer of\nstudent data between schools at a very\naccurate good measure by which we know\nthose students that are moving between\nschools how we can help them immediately\nwhen they come in the door not two or\nthree weeks later when part of the\nrecords come\nin but immediately when they come in the\ndoor\nit develops that team I talked about\nwhich is a behavioral threat assessment\nmanagement team at each individual\nschool that can set a threat\nlevel and decide is that a credible\nthreat or is that just to sit down with\nthat student and have a conversation\nthreat that is preventative folks just\nlike the mental health is preventable\nand we can deal with it when it comes in\nand then we can assist those children\nthrough it well before they get their\nhand on any violence inside their\nmind colleagues I can tell you I I\nabsolute hated to have to travel around\nthis state today talking about this\ntopic and it was because of what I had\nseen that occurred not\nonly in bar County in that school system\nbut what I had seen some in my\ncareer but I will tell you the Educators\nall the agencies that we dealt with that\nwe called in Behavioral\nHealth um\ngima Everybody sat down and developed a\nplan that will\nwork we didn't leave anybody out\nwe asked everybody to get\ntogether and I could see it in the\nhearts of the people in the room that\nare parents that are\ngrandparents hey it's all about\nprotecting our\nkids and we need to do what it takes\ntoday to support that team to protect\nour kids in the future and save lives\nthat you don't even know you've saved so\ncolleagues I can't get more clear than\nthis Save a Life\nToday Vote for This Bill thank you Mr\nSpeaker the

enforcement safety\ndevices this bill I referred to the\ncommittee on motor vehicles that\ncommittee recommends that this bill do\npass representative Washman is\nrecognized to present the bill give the\ngentleman your attention\nplease well thank you Mr\nSpeaker and Mr Speaker let me say I\nappreciate very\nmuch if you give the gentleman your\nattention there a lot of communication\nnotot of\ndiscussion proceed now didn't thank you\nMr Speaker and Mr Speaker I want to\nexpress my appreciation to you for\nletting me bring uh this bill and\npresent it to the\nhouse house bill 225 ceased to\nrepeal the use of automated School\ncameras and school zones in\nGeorgia this bill seeks to reverse the\nbill that was passed in\n2018 which was well-intentioned but the\nevidence clearly shows now that this\nbill or this these operation of these\ncameras has not improved Public Safety\nbut have instead become a highly\nprofitable Revenue stream for private\ncorporations and local\ngovernments the evidence is they do not\nimprove safety that corporations take a\nmassive cut of the revenue and that it\nis often seen as very unfair\nticketing that praise don't sometimes on\nthe least uh able in our society to pay\nthese fines the other issue is as a lack\nof due process there's some\nconstitutional concerns that have been\nexpressed repeatedly and the truth is\nour people when they're ticketed have uh\nno they have no way to contest uh the\ntickets we believe there are better\nAlternatives uh for Public Safety let me\njust tell you I want to go off on my\nwritten comments for a minute and just\ntell you my history with this and why\nI've become so passionate about it\nbefore I tell you that chairman Allen P\nwill be presenting a bill in a few\nminutes that is more of a a fix it Bill\nto add guard rails to try to correct\nsome of the problems that exist I will\nbe voting yes on chairman Powell's bill\nI believe that my bill is a good\nproposal to ban these School cameras and\nI'm going to plead my case with you for\nthat but I will be voting voting yes on\nchairman Powell's bill because I want us\nto send two bills to the Senate and hope\nthat we can get something done to\naddress this problem let me give you the\nhistory a couple of years ago or about\nover a year ago I began to get\ncomplaints from constituents about these\nschools on cameras and ticketing they\nwere receiving at first I thought they\nwere just folks that were mad because\nthey got a ticket and then a weekly\nnewspaper in our area the Monroe County\nmaking reporter began to do some\ninvestigative work and I discovered that\nin bib County that they had issued uh\nfines or had collected fines of $6.5\nmillion and I began to hear more and\nmore complaints from my constituents\nabout it so as I began to investigate\nthat I decided I want to introduce the\nbill to call for the ban of these\ncameras when I did that I then\ndiscovered that it was not just a making\nissue it was a Statewide issue and the\nevidence is overwhelming by the work of\ntwo television stations in Atlanta done\na lot of Investigation\nwork um ANF I believe it is and Fox 5\nhave done a lot of investigative work\nlast year one of those stations did some\nwork that showed and they documented\nthat $12 million had been collected\nacross Georgia $112\nmillion over a year ago so today we\nthink I believe that we can safely say\nthat fines have been have been issued\nuh at a level of in excess of $200\nmillion the schools on cameras are\ntaking a percentage of that using a\nconservative estimate they've probably\ntaken $50 million out of Georgia and put\nit into their\npockets ladies and gentlemen these these\nuh the stories abound about the\nunfairness of the ticketing and how it\noperates and hide\nworks it is unfair and when someone has\na unpaid ticket they won't be able to\nrenew their\ntag after I made the announcement that I\nwas going to drop a bill to ban these\ncameras I had an email from a lady in\nMon and she said thank you so much for\ndoing this I worked with a lot of low\nincome people I have had to help four\nladies recently pay Their fines one of\nthem could not get their tag renewed\nbecause of an unpaid\nfine ladies and gentlemen I told the\nmajority leader in the Sation one day\nabout I said Mr leader I've had one of\nthese\ntickets I said but I can afford to pay\nthe\n$100 but ladies and gentlemen I'm going\nto ask you to look up here for a\nminute this is what I used to do when I\nT real estate when something's important\nI'd say please look up here for a\nminute I can afford to pay the\n$100 but there's a lot of little Waffle\nHouse waitresses and cleaning ladies and\nconstruction workers and even some\nschool teachers who have a hard time\npaying that $100 fine and for them\nthat's $100 that might be needed to feed\ntheir\nchildren ladies and gentlemen it is\nwrong to allow these camera companies to\ntake the kind of money they're taken out\nof\nGeorgia it is wrong for them to be\ntaking the money out of the pockets of\nGeorgians who are often entrapped with\nthese schools on\ncameras it is also wrong that they're\ntaking the kind of money they're taking\nout to put into their corporate\nPockets I urge you to vote with me or to\nvote for this bill to ban the schools on\ncameras in\nGeorgia I ask for your favorable\nconsideration Mr Speaker I will yield\nfor any questions the gentleman has a\ncouple of questions representative\nGriffin to your right is recognized for\na question represent Griffin with a\ngentleman y I will isn't it true that\nyou and I represent two of the the\ncounties in uh legislative district yes\nwe do and isn't it true that I support\nyou on this bill for a number of reasons\nand one of those reasons is that we\ndon't know where the money is going\nto and that there are a number of things\nthat should be done and put in place to\nto make\nthis uh from the standpoint of the the\nthe lights and the speed zones and Etc\nif they if we want to make that\nsomething that should be in the school\nzones then it should be better than what\nwe have seen at least in our\narea that is a good assessment uh\nSenator I appreciate your comments\nchairman Powell's bill will be coming in\na minute does seek to reign in some of\nthe problems and as I said earlier I\nwill vote Yes on his bill but I I do\nbelieve that the best course of action\nis to ban these cameras in\nGeorgia another question Mr Speaker yes\nsir the gentleman you represent Al\nWilliams to your left right up front is\nrecognized for a question thank you Mr\nSpeaker will the gentleman yield\nabsolutely for my friend is it not not\ntrue that had it not been for your\neffort and your\ntenacity that this discussion would not\nbe going\non well you're kind to observe that I I\nwon't take all the credit I appreciate\nthe speaker letting me bring the bill\nand others who have spoken for that is\nit with the gentleman you absolutely is\nit not further\ntrue that I don't know what's going to\nhappen but something is going to happen\nfar too too many Georgians have spent\nmoney when there was no problem during\n2:00 in the day of our children being on\nthe streets so no matter what happens\nhere thank you for your effort and\nmaking this a major conversation thank\nyou thank you sir and thank you for\nmentioning that I did not spend much\ntime on the abuses but there are many\nabuses and they reported often thank you\nfor that comment will park is recognized\nfor our question thank you Mr Speaker\ndoes the gentleman yield I do for the\nwhip um representative is it not true\nthat while I appreciate your passion as\nI've uh shared with you earlier you know\nI think this bill goes too far and\nrepealing all school's own cameras and\nis it not further true that I think\nthere may be a rule substitute on our\ndesk that may be something that provides\nappropriate safeguards to again ensure\nthat our schools um and our school zones\nand the children in them are protected\nis that not true it is true that I\nbelieve it is best to ban them it is\nalso true there's another bill coming\nthat seeks to rain them in and I should\nsay also I am never suggesting that\nevery community that is using these\ncameras is abusing them the way some are\nbut I do believe that at taking $200\nmillion uh what the estimate is and it's\na good estimate I think we cannot allow\nthem to be used in some communities\nwhere they are not being abused and the\nrest of Georgia be penalized at the rate\nthey're being penalized for\nthat gentlemen you go for another\nquestion or yes sir I will\nrepresentative SS is recognized for a\nquestion to your left there\nrepresentative Washton does the\ngentleman yield I do is it not true that\nI appreciate that the reason for the\ngentleman to bring this up is because of\nits misuse but that these public safety\ntools do have the potential to ensure\nthat officers aren't on the street Ure\na uh traffic laws are followed and\ninstead in the school system ensuring\nthat our targets are hardening and out\nin in the service in our community\nresponding to\ncalls I believe I understand the\nquestion and that is that these cameras\ncan be used effectively to to uh prevent\nthe need for police officers there I\nwill say that the evidence is clear\nthere are ways to control speed in in\nschool zones and often the case of\nflashing lights warning lights the\ntrouble is often tickets are being\nwritten when the lights are not flashing\nand so there are abuses there in place\nbut thank you for the\nquestion representative Dawson is\nrecognized for question to your left\nrepresentative Washman thank you yes uh\ndoes the gentleman yield I do is it uh\nnot true that I shared with you in my\ncity the city of South Fon which\nactually raises the most funds of any\nmunicipality using these cameras is it\nnot true that I shared with you that I\nwas on the scene the day that a young U\nMiddle School student was killed by a\nspeeding driver and that we have since\num initiated cameras that prevent these\ntype of\naccidents I don't recall that you shared\nthat with me but certainly it is is a\nterrible tragedy whenever a child is\nkilled but I will I must say that there\nare there is little evidence that the\ncameras would have prevented that\ntragedy thank\nyou gentleman has a couple more\nquestions yield is he I'll be glad to\ntake them Mr Speaker representative\nHefner right up that to your left in the\nback is recogniz Speaker this the\ngentleman y yes ma'am is it not true\nthat I support this bill because as the\nmotor vehicle registration director in\nRichmond County you and I had\nconversations about how much time and\nhow much money was allocated for me to\nhire outside attorneys to un mangle\nthese situations when those cameras\nissue tickets in error to Residents in\nmy County sir yes ma'am that is true\nthank you for your support yes sir\ngentleman has one more question\nrepresentative Scott to your right is\nrecognized for a\nquestion thank you Mr Speaker that's the\ngentleman Yi yes ma'am I do I would like\nto thank you for bringing this bill and\nI have one question Mrs speaker it is to\nyou um representative edner Jackson and\nI would like to vote twice on this bill\nbecause we have had two\ntickets\n$100 I think the lady need to slow down\nis what I'm thinking no Mr Speaker one\nbefore school started and one after\nschool ended but uh but we would just\nlike to vote twice on these bills and we\nwill feel some type of satisfaction\nthank you for bringing this Bill thank\nyou gentleman has I she'll have to vote\nher conscience that's all I can tell\nher gentleman has no further questions\nwell thank you Mr Speaker for your\npatience in allowing so many questions\nand ladies and gentlemen of the house\nthank you for listening to me on this\nbill and I would ask for your favorable\nconsideration thank you very much I\nyield the well gentleman has yielded the\nwell is there any objection to the\nprevious question being ordered

time\nthis state had a city called Ludy whsy\nthat had a terrible uh reputation and\nbrought uh a speed trap in this state\nand this body had to take measures to uh\nreduce it and stop it is that not true\nwhy are you looking at Trooper Hitchens\non that deal I think he's in that\npicture down there and I'm sure the\ngentleman knows of what he speaks for\nwhat purposes representative Evans rise\nthank you Mr Speaker parliamentary\ninquiry St your inquir Mr Speaker isn't\nit true that school cameras have been\nresponsible for a 92% decrease in\nspeeding around schools and that I don't\nunderstand a body that is so dedicated\nto school\nsafety passing this legislation\nespecially when we know that there's a\npiece of legislation that we're going to\nalso get to vote on that doesn't throw\nthe baby out with the bath water and\njust puts reasonable parameters around\nwhat is a very good idea to protect our\nkids and if people are mad that they're\ngetting tickets maybe they shouldn't\nspeed in front of our\nbabies I'm sure the lady knows and\nbelieves in what she speaks for what\npurposes represented chairman de\nrise inquiry Mr Speaker State inquir Sir\nMr Speaker

with that since\nyou represent them we want you to come\nback for what purpose does chair lady\nCooper\nrise parliamentary inquiry\nM isn't it true that sometimes when we\nconsider bills that are and when we're\nhad to solve a problem that we're having\nacross our state that sometimes we go\ntoo far from one side to the other\ninstead of solving the problem and\nfinding a compromise we just throw the\nproblem out and I am thankful that we\nhave another bill coming forth It's on\nour desk that has a more reasonable\napproach to try to really solve the\nproblem and still take care of the\nsafety Factor thank you Mr Speaker\nsure the lady knows what she speaks of\nnow all members voted all members voted\nif so Mr clerk will you lock the machine\non the passage of House Bill 225 the Y\nare 129 the Nays are 37 this bill has\nreceived a reest constitutional majority\nis therefore\npassed Mr clerk will you read a caption\nto House Bill 651\n651 House Bill 651 by re repr paollo the\n33rd and others to be entitled act to\namend Article 2 chapter 14 en title 40\nof the official code of George annotator\nrelating speed detection devices so to\nRevis Provisions relative to the use of\nautomated traffic enforcement safety\ndevices in school zones this bill and\nreferred the committee on motor vehicles\nthat committee recommends that this bill\ndo pass by rules committee substitute\nthank you members chairman Powell is\nrecognized to present House Bill 651\nchairman\nPowell thank you Mr Speaker ladies and\ngentlemen of the house you know that's\ngoing to be a hard act to\nfollow but I would certainly like to\npreface my comments before I go into the\nbill on this you know\nI appreciate uh my colleague\nrepresentative Washman and I told people\nwhen a lot of folks were asking me why\nhe was going to the extreme of banning\nthese machines or these this process\nwith the cameras and I told him that I\nsaid if I lived in his district where\nthey had plucked $65 million dollar out\nof the economy I'd probably be doing the\nsame thing I probably wouldn't be near\nas patient as he's been\nbut I will tell you and you a lot of\ny'all have been here a while have heard\nme say this but we come in we meet on\nthe second Monday of every January to\nfix\nbills that don't work that's gone a\nright and uh what he I have to take his\nword for it but uh in 2018 we passed\nthis bill as a matter of school safety\nto give local law enforcement a tool\nthat they could use with these cameras\nas a civil\ncitation granted was a lot of things\nover the years has changed that made\nthis even worse and not acceptable to\nthe\npublic now before I go any further I\nwant to thank the folks in my district\nbecause ain't a damn place got a red\nlight cam school zone camera in the\nThree Counties that I represent but we\nhave one that's just outside the\ndistrict and I know from where he speaks\nabout the unfairness of this the\noriginal Bill had a lot of parameters on\nit that got uh taken away over the years\nthrough different forms so then what\nwe've got to here with 651 is a second\nchoice representative Washburn has got\none to ban and this is one that's got a\nlot of strict parameters it puts these\nback under into play as a tool for law\nenforcement and I'm going to go over\nthis bill carefully but before I do it I\nwant to tell you why we're doing two\nbills and why the leadership has ushered\ntwo bills\nout I worked with uh the former chairman\nof Public Safety over the last couple of\nyears uh representative\nCollins and out of Public Safety we\ntried to fix this bill we tried to fix\nthis process and we sent a couple of\nbills over to the Senate and they didn't\ndo\nanything they did nothing they were\nbasically tossed in the trash and\nnothing was done he didn't run for\nreelection and somehow I got drafted\ninto bringing this bill up\nwhen I say draft it almost feel like I\nneeded one of them gun safs to hide the\ngun from me to shoot keep from shooting\nmyself but I want to go over this bill\nwith and I want y'all to pay attention\nbecause I'm going to try go through\nSection section and Line to Line on this\nbill so yall will understand the\nparameters that we put in and between\nthe two bills if this bill is fortunate\nenough to pass along with the\nrepresentative washburns that we'll send\ntwo bills over to the state senate cuz\nwe've heard the rep we've heard the uh\nthe words that come out of the Senate\nthat they've got no appetite for Banning\nanything so we want to give them a\nsecond choice and that's what 651 is all\nabout ladies and gentlemen of the\nbill school zone safety\ncameras section one defines the school\nzones between the state Master order in\nlocal school systems and this would\ndepend according to council what whether\nit's on State Highway or not section\ntwo 500 ft you put a sign they'll have\nto put a sign 500 ft prior to the\nwarnings and these signs will include\nnot just that 4x3 sign post but it's got\nto have flashing yellow lights and in\nthis they'll have to have one of these\nuh camera or one of these radar speed\ndetectors to warn the people when\nthey're coming into speed zone how fast\nthey're running\nthat should be a help\nhopefully uh the signs are very\nstraightforward with the flashing uh\nwith flashing lights\nand and these signs have to be on\nclearly on before citation can be\nissued section four 35% rule you know I\ndon't want to get into talking about\nLudi but in earlier life uh we had a\ngovernor who put up signs down in Ludi\ndeclaring a speed\ntrap and over the period of years this\nlegislature over the years put in what\nwas called a 35% Rule and the 35% rule\nbasically says that if a local\njurisdiction raises more than 35% of\ntheir\nrevenue yeah if it if they raise more\nthan 35% of their revenue\nthen they are subject to lose their\nability by Public Safety taking a good\nlook at what they're doing so the 35%\nrule has put into effect into this bill\nwhich a lot of people had asked about\ndoing section five does something that\nuh I don't know why it was never done to\nstart with but in this\nstate on radar the only people who can\ntag you with a ticket for the exact\nspeed on radar is a Georgia State Patrol\nwe have What's called the 10% rule\nalways have it had it in Georgia and\nthat's that if you running whatever that\nspeed limit is you've got extra 10 mil\nan hour\nvariance and that's what we put into\nthis so if a speed zone is 15 it's the\nyou would go 25 if it's 25 it'd be a 35\nmph before you're cited in this so we\nput that in the same uh the same system\nthat we do the radar with the 10 mph\nvariance probably one of the most\nimportant parts of this since uh we know\nthat all the complaints have come of be\npeople have gotten these\ncitations uh in the middle of the day in\nthe middle of the night different times\nother than what's supposed to be but\nwe're clearly saying again when these\ncameras are eligible to be run one hour\nbefore school 1 hour after it convenes\nand in the afternoon the same so we have\na 4H hour gap two in the morning and two\nin the afternoon and that's pretty\nclearly spelled out in this\nbill on line\n101 this deals with four lanes a lot of\npeople that ask questions about the\nforlane highways this gives the\nDepartment of Public Safety and and do\nthe right to take a look at these four\nlane highways if it's on the state\nhighway next we get on down into online\n10 one excuse me\n111 the monetary fine first offense is\n$75 second offense is 125 and we have\nstricken that $25 admin fee that we\nnever could figure out what that went to\nexcept just to raise more\nmoney\nso your fines are clearly spelled out no\nadd owns no admin fees or anything else\nif you'll look on the\nmoney well let's go on to the next line\non one on Line 120 this\ndefines this\ndefines what agency is sending you out\nof citation and remember these are civil\ncitations not traffic citations but on\nthat they have to clearly spell on the\nenvelope it's got to be displayed on the\nenvelope which city county including any\nseal that they may have so that there's\nno mistake whenever you would get that\nnotice in the mail\non\n144 through\n146 your rights is clearly spelled out\nand if you'll see on that line that you\nhave a right to contest the liability by\nContracting your local Court very\nclearly spelled out due process was\nalways involved in this process but I\nthink that it was a convenience matter\nto a lot of people that they didn't want\nto take it to court if they got a\ncitation because most people probably\nrealize in a lot of cases they might\nhave been\nspeeding but in this it clearly spells\nout take it to your\ncourt if you go to line\n212 and let that go down to somewhere\nlike\n235 I don't know when it was added in\nstate law but uh Somewhere Over The\nPeriod of time in the last 57 years\nthere was a clause that was put in it\nsaid if you received one of these civil\ncitations and you didn't remediate that\ncitation that that citation was turned\nover to the revenue department and you\ncouldn't get it you couldn't have get\nyour tags or titles we have stricken all\nof that\nlanguage so it'll no longer go to the\nrevenue department for any of these\ncivil\ncitations if you'll look on line\n241 and we tell you what this does\nbefore I get into where the money is\ngoing to be split we have described what\nis a school safety\npurpose school safety purposes for\npublic private elementary secondary\nschools and enhance and ensure the\nprotection of students staff visitors to\nsuch a school including but not limited\nto access control systems communication\nsystems cyber security measures\nperimeter systems surveillance system\nvisitor Management Systems employment\nCrossing guards safety protocol training\nnow I say that for your attention\nbecause when we get down to the real\ngist of everything it's always about\nthat saying follow the\nmoney and the follow the money is the\nlocal jurisdictions won't be able to\nkeep the bulk of that money anymore they\nwill divide that up into half 50% of all\nmoney will go to school safety within\ntheir school jurisdictions and they'll\nhave to show that every year of every\nquarter\nbecause they'll have to report it on\ntheir website and they'll have to report\nwhat schools and how much money is being\nsent to\nthem Mr Speaker that's the Gest of the\nbill there's a lot of guard rails\nthere's a lot of parameters put on here\num I tell people over the years to ban\nsomething has never been a there's never\nbeen a success in Banning it's always\nabout putting the proper guard rails\ninto parameters on things what happened\nin this leg legislature over the years\nit started out as an idea for school\nsafety and it got out of hand I've heard\neverything in the world about the C the\ncompanies that provide these cameras to\neverything else but at the end of the\nday what we have found is that roughly\n70 65 70 70% of all the money that has\ncome in has gone to the local cities and\ncounties that run these uh speed zone\ncameras so if you look at this ladies\nand gentlemen with a 10 mile variance\nthat puts them under the same guard\nrails as the state patrol and any radar\ncitation and you put all this other\nstuff\ntogether send this over to the\nSenate that way we will have sent two\nbills representative wason's Bill to ban\nand this one with extreme guard rails to\nclean it up the way it should be to give\nthe Senate an option to look to let it\nbe known that this House of\nRepresentatives is is very serious about\ndealing with this uh with this problem\nand this issue and that Mr Speaker is a\npresentation on this bill I thank I'll\nagain thank representative wasman for\nmaking an issue you know we'd made an\nissue over the years uh with\nrepresentative Collins did to no avail\nwe understand through the Great Vine uh\nthat they have no appetite for ban over\nin the Senate so hopefully with two\nbills that go forward hopefully with\nthese two bills that you will see the\nSenate actually deal with this issue and\ncome up with some ideas as they should\nhave done a few years ago Mr Speaker\nI'll be glad to stand for questions will\nyou have a couple I'm sure I do I want\nto recognize the minority leader of this\nhouse representative Carolyn hugley from\nover Columbus for a\nquestion thank you Mr Speaker does the\ngentleman yield certainly this is isn't\nit true that it's unusual that we would\nsend two bills on the same subject on\nthe same day over from this house to the\nSenate you could probably say that but\nyou know we have to deal with the state\nsenate I hadn't seen it in all these\nyears the great state of Utah has the uh\nInfinite Wisdom that they have a\nunicameral form of government but we\nhave a state senate that we deal\nwith would you further yield yes\nIAM is't it true I've never seen us\nyield to the Senate and in imply that\nthe Senate could make a better decision\nthan the\nhouse still it's got to go through the\nSenate takes two it takes two to\ntango gentleman y for another question\ncertainly chairman Corbett to your right\nrecognize for a question chairman\nCorbett thank you Mr Speaker does\ngentleman y yes sir is it not true that\nwe sent both of these bills to the\nSenate last year you know not back to\nback but we did send them both last year\nwe did we sent two bills over there that\nwould clean up this uh this Red Lake\nthis speed zone camera and they didn't\nso maybe out of these two bills this\nmight get their\nattention gentleman to your left\nrepresent Mary Francis Williams is\nrecognized for a question thank you Mr\nSpeaker does a gentleman yield yes ma'am\nthank you so much Mr chairman for\nbringing this bill I'm I'm lucky to be\nin an area where our speed cameras are\nturned off um when uh you know when you\nknow\nI at you know when school's not in and\nin the summer they're totally turned off\nso so we're lucky in that way we haven't\nhad the abuses and I although I am um\nsensitive to the fact that other\ncommunities are seeing those abuses but\nthe other reason I'm grateful to you for\noffering us options is um in in Marietta\nand cob our high school is on Dallas\nHighway Highway 120 and if anybody has\never driven that that's a major highway\nand without speed cameras to to slow\nthings down a little bit during those\nfew hours it would be a really dangerous\nsituation um and we've got other areas\nlike that um an area like Marietta and\nCobb we have we have schools that are in\nmajor you know on major busy roads and\nspeed cameras have helped protect our\nchildren so um I'm grateful to you for\nbringing this and for offering options\nand I hate to see us turn away from\nanything that protects children thank\nyou thank you ma'am is it not true I\nonly comment I would make that a lot of\njurisdictions do it the right way but\nthere are so many that don't do it the\nright way so many jurisdictions have\nopted out that this is a money uh money\nmaker for their various Inc departments\nso that being said this would clean it\nup for all\ndepartments Mr chairman you have a\ncouple more if I can recognize them yes\nsir uh representative yasman Neil to\nyour left is recognized for a question\nto your left Mr\nchairman thank you to the speaker thank\nyou to the chair thank you for the bill\nuh is it not true that in my county in\nmy district I've had countless erroneous\ntickets issued to my citizens to include\nthose that are in lower income\ncommunities um and they've had a lot of\ntrouble getting them rectified as they\nbeing they receive these tickets far\noutside the necessary hours um so my I\ndo have a few questions in relation to\nthe bill\nitself um if you look at lines 85 you\nhave to go to all of them I'll just tell\nyou what it is line 85 108 130 137 151\n153 we remove photographic\nphotographically and for instance like\non 153 law enforcement is to review\nphotographic images to determine guilt\nor\ninnocence my question is if we're\nremoving\nphotographic what are what is law\nenforcement supposed to use to determine\nguilt or innocence in these moments so\nlegislative Council chose to do that to\nclean up the bill my understanding is\nthat that these cameras take a snapshot\nand these camera and these photographs\nare on\na laptop or a video screen of some sort\nyes and that's where the images are\nbroadcast back to the to the offender\nyes so granted I do support both the\nbills I just find that we might have\ntrouble um if we don't clarify a\ndefinition or if we remove\nphotographically and don't put what we\nare replacing photo the photograph with\nwe might have trouble so it might be\nnecessary to adjust in the future I'm\nnot sure how they Define what the legal\ndefinition is of photographic but these\nare images that are taken by these\ncameras yes but we removed photographic\nin this\nbill that's how the council wrote it I'm\nnot I don't think that it I don't think\nthat it removed it I think that it so\nthese photographs are made or the images\nare then cast over the computer and\nthat's how they take those images and\nsend them out okay all right thank you\nsir remember that the local law part of\nthe part of the process is the local law\nenforcement agencies are supposed to\nreview every one of these and quite\nfrankly we know of a lot of cases that\nthey have it yes so granted I I support\nthe bill I'm just making a\nrecommendation as we move forward that\nmight be a good fix yes ma Mr chairman\nwe have a legal Authority that may have\nan opinion on that part love to hear\nrepresentative Leverett is recognized\nfor our question thank you Mr Speaker\nwith the gentleman yield yes sir to the\nladi's question my dear friend's\nquestion in uh over there is it not true\nthat a photographic image would not\nnecessarily include a digitally recorded\nor created image and thus that is for\nthe reason for the uh striking of that\nlanguage if the gentleman so States\nbecause that's the reason you're an\nattorney and I'm a real estate broker as\nas I'm sure it's a source of great pride\nfor your mother Mr chairman thank you I\nam as you are\nyours Mr chairman we need if you don't\nmind one more question from gentleman\nwho needs to defend himself on that Luda\nwhsy situation chairman Hitchens to your\nleft is recognized for a question yes\nsir gentleman y yes sir is it not true\nthat even though you get a civil\ncitation and you have to pay a fine you\ndon't get any appoints assessed on your\ndriver's like like you would with\nanother speeding citation you are\ncorrect Mr Speaker I hope I've answered\nmost of the questions I think everybody\nin here is they know what the drill is\non this um we have two distinct\ndifferent bills but both are hoping to\nget us to the same uh solution one is to\nban them in this entirety and the other\none put some very rigid guard rails\naround them to send them over to the\nSenate to see if the Comm over there\nwill'll take a look at them and realize\nhow serious this house is with that Mr\nSpeaker I'll yield the will and ask for\nyour favorable consideration

committee\nsubstitute chair recognizes\nrepresentative Kelly to present the\nBell thank you madam speaker members of\nthe house I know a lot of us in here uh\nboth personally and with our\nconstituents enjoy spending time in our\noutdoors and one of our you know\nGeorgia's most famous outdoor activities\nis turkey hunting and I the measure\nbefore you is aimed at helping to make\nsure that generations to come have ample\nturkey hunting opportunities and I'm\nproud that this is a measure that was\nbrought to me by some of my constituents\nuh back in P County Colton bosan Brady\nGarrett and Dave Owens who is a two-time\nNational Turkey coling Champion they're\npassionate about this Sport and they\nwanted to make sure that we preserve it\nfor future generations and so what this\nlegislation does is two things one it\ncreates a separate turkey permit from\nour big game permit this will\neffectively allow the Department of\nNatural Resources to calculate how many\npeople are hunting turkeys in Georgia uh\nthere will be no charge to our instate\nresidents there will be a $100 fee for\nout of state residents and then it will\nalso create a voluntary turkey stamp\nwhere the funds will go to uh preserve\nuh the turkey populations and their\nenvironment uh again that will be\nvoluntary uh and something that the DNR\nwill develop every year so um Madam\nspeaker I'll be glad to you for any\nquestions the gentleman has questions\nthe chair\nrecognizes chairman rhs for a question\ndoes a gentleman you certainly I will I\njust wanted to find out

education opportunity\nabout turkeys in our state and this is a\nstamp that will be designed annually by\nour Department of Natural Resources that\npeople can purchase voluntarily that\nwill help raise money for our uh turkey\npreservation chair recognizes\nrepresentative Canon for a question\nthank you m speaker do you yield uh\ncertainly awesome so here in Atlanta we\ndon't really have much of this help me\nunderstand so it says line 35 starting\nnext year anyone 16 or older to hunt\nturkey in this state has to have a\npermit what happens if they don't have\nthat permit so they already today have\nto have a permit but the permit is\nincluded in the big game license which\nincludes deer and others but there's\nfines and penalties if you don't have\nthat today this is just separating the\nturkey permit from the big game permit\nso that we can more accurately track uh\nthe uh individual turkey\nhunters okay how much is that fine\nI don't know off the top of my hand\nright now but we're not changing the\nfine with this bill and for any of my\nfriends in Atlanta that want to get out\nand Hunt some turkeys we'll be glad to\ntake you out in Ral\nGeorgia I'll be glad to take a few

companies that\nmany of our constituents are having to\ndeal with these days and and let me just\nsay private water companies have their\nplace but what this bill does is it\nhelps make sure that our

this what I want to\nclarify as far as the PSC actually\nhaving that hearing it says the\ncommission upon its election to enter\ninto a hearing does that mean that they\nwill automatically have the hearing or\nthey have to kind of get together and\ndecide whether to have a hearing on that\nrace I can't exactly hear you from the\nnoise in here but basically what but\nbasically what that what that means is\nif their hearing is Justified then they\nwill not have another hearing for\nanother three years if you just one more\nbut the the initial after the initial\nraise though does the PSC have a hearing\nat that time or do they decide whether\nwhether to have a hearing or not if they\nraise their rates 15% or more over a\nthree-year span then they will have a\nhearing in front of the PSC

Baptist\nChurch and if you would join me in a\nmoment of silence for miss busy\nthank you amen thank you members one\nmore condolences chairman n Williams\nspeak to us about our great\nagriculturalist in our estate that died\nuh thank you Mr Speaker um members I\nwould like to honor a great man from\ncordal Georgia you can see him up here\nhis name was Buddy leer he was very\ninstrumental in the watermelon and pcan\nIndustry um he was nominated he had a\nton of awards um um throughout his 93\nyears on this Earth he went home to be\nwith his Lord on Friday um he one of his\nmost significant things he did was he\nwas in the transition team between the\nReagan and Bush years and agriculture\nfor the state of Georgia um like I said\nhe was in college Hall of Fame from the\nUniversity of Georgia College of a in\n2012 and he leaves behind a wife\nmargerie and three children just a great\nman and a great American and I think\nthese two might want to say something as\nwell well I know buddy my whole career\nand when buddy was we were in meetings\nuh when buddy spoke everyone listened he\nI don't know of a person who had more\ncredibility and more honesty and could\nuh analyze a position better than buddy\nlir and he had a great impression on\nme Mr Buddy was one of the first people\nthat I met after I graduated from\ncollege and entered a career in politics\nand one thing about Mr Buddy and and the\nwhat chairman dicki just said is\nabsolutely correct uh when he spoke\neveryone listened and when you've been\nin the industry for more than 75 years\nin agriculture you've taught you've\ntaught some of the younger generation\nsomething and that was what Mr Buddy in\nmy opinion spent his career doing and\nthose of us that are still involved in\nagriculture stand on the should\nshoulders of those Giants and he indeed\nwas a giant in the agricultural\nCommunity when it came to watermelons he\nknew more about it than anybody else uh\nas well as pans but uh Mr Buddy was near\nand dear to my heart he actually called\nme back in December uh randomly one\nafternoon and we talked almost an hour\nuh but he was just one of those guys and\nfrom the look on that face you
