  "transcript": "you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you from the 168th House District Representative Al Williams, Representative Williams. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As I was getting up, I looked over to my right, and the RICU was holding in. I don't know what the indication was, because I don't read that kind of language. So I've only got a 30 minute introduction. So it's just great to be here. Too reasonable amount of time. Speaker has a way of making his point. But I am truly honored this morning, and I don't just say that. I'm honored to introduce the Chaplin for the Day, because I literally have known her all of her life. She is, I consider one of my dearest friends, and I'm extremely proud of her. And she's from Midway, and her mother, babysit me in church just a few years ago. And I want you to know, Mr. Speaker, her mother said, that I was the most beautiful baby she has ever seen. Each her heart's out. But what our minister today has been, and his associate pastor of the Cal remission Air Baptist Church, that we both attend, she lives in Liberty County. She has a varied background. She is, of course, a community leader. She's a member of the Board of Education. And she's not going to want me to say this, but she'll be announcing next week that she's running for Chairman of the Liberty County Board of Education, and well-qualified she is. She's a mother. She has two beautiful daughters whom I call my superstars. Shella and Dejana. And her husband is here with her. And this is the very first spouse that has been allowed on the flow in two years, and it could only happen for Liberty County. This is retired Air Force, a silent Randolph Jones. And he's here with us. And it's great to have you here with us, Randolph. History goes way back. I, most of the games, if I'm in town, I watch it their house. And it's just a joy to know them. She has started a new program called The Midway Project that will distribute books to first-time readers. And then she will have literacy classes for old of her. She has done a marvelous job. She's a state-form agent. Her agency is in Savannah, though she lives in Midway. And that explains, Representative Hucley, why you don't have any of my policies. But she has a word for us today. Because above all else, she loves the Lord. Without any further ado, I present to you, Minister Verdeal Jones. Good morning, good morning, good morning. Truly, this is the day that the Lord has made. And we shall rejoice and be glad in it. To the speaker of the house, the honorable David Rolson, and to my brother, my mentor, my friend, and my state representative, the honorable Al Williams. I thank you for the invitation to allow me to speak a few words and pray with you on this morning. Earlier this year, I was sharing with my staff that we have been through a rough couple of years. And it almost feels as bad as a storm or tornado. As those words fell from my lips, my mind went back to the old movie, The Wizard of Oz. You remember the story, right? There was a tornado in Kansas. And you remember that Dorothy and her dog got picked up and landed in a city called Oz. Dorothy was so sad and lost, and all she wanted to do was to get back home. Can we focus on home for just a moment? Home, that place where you live with your family, home, a dwelling place, a place where you feel like you belong home, a place that is safe and secure, a place that's full of love, joy, and peace. Really? That's what we all want when we think about home. On Dorothy's quest to get back home, she found herself on a yellow brick road. And on that road, she ran into three characters. I know you wonder, and why in the world is she telling us about a movie? Just stay with me for a moment. The scarecrow that she ran into needed a brain so that he could think the ten man of heart so he could love and the cowardly lion courage to fight. And Dorothy needed some faith for the journey. Today, as we look around, we are faced with all kinds of tornadic situations that try to keep us away from the place that we call home. We're faced with sickness and death and injustices and evils, poverty and lack. And in recent days, even war, Lord, have mercy on us. And all we want is a place called home, a place full of love, joy and peace. I remember when my husband and I were in Italy, and he was serving in the Air Force, so many days I longed for Georgia, sweet Georgia. Because Georgia was always on my mind, because that was home. I think of each of you every day, week after week. You leave your homes to come here and serve your communities, to serve 11 million people who call Georgia home. Thank you for your sacrifice. And I want you to know that God has not forgotten about you. And he says to you this morning, and my God shall supply all your needs according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus. As you continue your work, we realize that we don't have a yellow brick road to get home, but all of our roads lead to Jesus. We need a brain to think. So we find in James one and five, as if any man lacks wisdom. Let him ask God who gives to all liberally without reproach, and it will be given to him. We need a heart to love and care for people. And we find in Psalms 51, create in me a clean heart, a gentle God, and renew in me the right spirit, because the heart is the symbol of love. We need courage to fight for better homes for all Georgians, courage to make difficult decisions, and to stand for what is right. So Isaiah 41 and 10 says, We are not for I am with you. Be not dismayed for I am your God. I will strengthen you. Yes, I will help you. I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. Lastly, Dorothy needed some faith to get back home. Mark chapter 11, verse 22. So God answered and said, Have faith in God. There are many men, women, boys, and girls depending on you all to make their homes a better place. I encourage you that when tough times come, when you get tired and weary, when it seems like your backs are up against the wall, remember the words in Philippians 4 and 13, and it says, I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me. Let us pray. Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for this day. Lord, before we think of ourselves on today, we lift up the people in Ukraine. We ask that you throw your arms of protection around them and bind them, bind the hand of the enemy. Have mercy on them. Oh God. Now, Lord, we thank you for these great men and women that make up the Georgia House of Representatives. Thank you for their family, their staff, and especially their constituents. Lord, we acknowledge you as the head of our life. And we ask you to forgive us of our sins and all of our shortcomings. Lord, I pray that you give them wisdom, knowledge, and understanding to think like you, a clean heart and a renewed spirit to love like you, and then give them the tenacity, the strength, the firmness of mind to be fearless and fight like you. Give them the faith, faith, to trust you in every situation. Lord, remind us that there are many little boys and girls depending on us and believing that somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly and dreams really do come true. Bless our homes, O Lord, let peace, love, and joy abide and bless every home across this great state of Georgia and across this nation. Lord, if there is one whose soul is lost today, please help them find their way back home to you, O Lord. And Jesus name my pray, amen. Amen. Lord, keepers will unlock the doors. The members may greet the chaplain in the south any room. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Your committee on information and audits has read the journal of the previous legislative day and found it to be correct. And furthermore, Mr. Speaker, there are some people who always seem to be angry and continuously looking for conflict. Walk away from these people.

Ladies and gentlemen of the House, yesterday was Alpha, Alpha Day at the State Capitol and one of our honorees was not able to be present. He was in Washington. So our Legislator of the Year for this year is State Representative Billy Mitchell. We want to congratulate him this morning. Thank you, Pigeon. Thank you, Pigeon. Better come before the red light come on. No, you don't get to say anything. Holy word after they can see it. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I don't get to say anything. Chair recognizes Representative Mitchell. You got about 35 seconds. All right, I can do this in 35 seconds. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As I stand here today, our COVID protections in Georgia and the U.S. have changed fundamentally in the past week. I want you to look around you to the left and right and understand that all of your actions over the past two years have made this body and this community safer for your colleagues and their families. We need to continue to center community care in our responses. If you see someone taking more precautions than you are, it is unnecessary to question their reasons. If they want you to know, they'll tell you. And it might just bring you to tears. I recommend everyone be kind, be compassionate and be safe. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I yield the well. All right. We're going on now to the rules calendar. Moving on to the rules calendar. All members will take your seats and pay attention. We are going to be on a little bit of a tight schedule here this morning with our guests that's coming in shortly. The chair did want to, though, before we left morning orders, ask for your prayers for Representative Clint Crowe. Now, it's yesterday his mother was in very, very poor condition and she passed from this life yesterday afternoon. And so let's keep Clint and his family in our thoughts and prayers. Let's have a moment of silence. Thank you very much. We're on the rules calendar. The clerk will read House will 1292. House Bill 1292 by resident of Jasper, the 11th and others to be entitled to amend Title 20 of the fiscal year. The Georgia and Atlanta were laid in education. So as prohibits students who participate in 4-8 sponsored activities or programs from being counted as absent from school. This bill I'm referring to committee on education that committee recommends that this bill pass. Chair recognizes Chairman Jasper to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members who present House Bill 1292. This bill is for our 4-8 students across the state of Georgia. It will allow for an excuse absence when the attendant out of school event is certified by the extension professional. Like all absences, they've got to make up their work and all that good stuff.\n\nIt allows the school system to treat it as an educational field trip. And just for a little bit of knowledge, 4-H program is sponsored by us, the General Assembly, through the funds that go to the University of Georgia and also local funds that are provided by the school systems. And you'll see 4-H programs in the fifth grade up in our public education system. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. There's any questions I'd be glad to answer them. You do have a question if you care to heal. Yes, sir. Chair recognizes I'm sure this is an equal protection question. The Chair of the House Appropriations Committee, Chairman England, do you write for a question? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is gentleman yield. Absolutely, sir. I'm looking at this and we're sitting over here talking about it and trying to understand why you're favoring 4-H and you're not including FFA. Green and white, blessed versus blue and gold, just wondering. Well thank you, Mr. Chairman. We love both. And fortunately, FFA is an integral part of school systems through their CTAE program. And this just helps 4-H really get on equal footing. Very good answer. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, it's a great bill. Support the kids. I yield the will. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. What purpose does representative Wilson rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Speaker, isn't it true if the members of this body want to show their support for Georgia 4-H? They would vote green for 4-H? Look at all that green, Mr. Speaker. A brilliant observation. I've been telling them that you were smarter than you looked and acted. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 1292. The eyes are 162. The nasors zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1303. House Bill 1303, members of Dickey, the 140th and others to be entitled to amend part 3 of Article 6 of chapter 2, title 20. The official go to Georgia annotated relating an educational program. So it's to transition a pilot program for elementary agriculture education to an ongoing program. House Bill I refer to the committee on education. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes Chairman Dickey to present the bill. Dr. Ms. Speaker, I bring you HB 1303, a small bill just asking to remove the pilot program wording so that elementary education can be a full time option for our elementary schools in 2019. We passed legislation to start a pilot program to be established in Georgia the first in the nation. And so our Department of Education, staff work with pilot schools to develop the curriculum. And we thought we were going to start with six schools. We started with 25. And all across our state and urban areas and metro areas and rural areas. Started with 7,000 students. We're up to 14,000 students. A great program that's been very well received. They are teaching these young people to stem classes through ag education. And we just got a great model in our high schools and middle schools with not only full education, but FFA as well. And just want to start those young people young with this type of education. And it's just one of the fastest growing areas in our elementary education. It's great for our young people to learn agriculture. I had mixed the daily needs and how they can produce their own food. And Mr. Speaker, if there's any questions, if not... I'll yield the oil. There is a question. The chair recognizes Representative Clark for a question. Thank you, Madam Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? I do. So I just want to clarify just to make sure I'm understanding this correctly. This bill does not now require that all elementary schools have agriculture education. It's just extending it for the schools that currently have a pilot. This is very optional for our local school systems. They supply the teachers and develop the implementation part of it. Our Department of Education, Ag Department developed the curriculum. So it's no requirement. It's totally up to local school systems how they implement it. Sometimes it's... Once a week, sometimes it's a two or three week program. Some of the very ways they teach this high education. Does the gentleman further yield? I do. I guess what I'm trying to ask is does every elementary school... Now that we've crossed out pilot, does every elementary school in Georgia need to have some type of agricultural education or is it specifically just schools that choose to have? This bill, if it passes, will make it an option for every elementary school in our state. An option, though, not over part. An option. All right. Thank you very much. Okay. With that, I'll leave the oil. The gentleman has yielded the well. The chair recognizes representative Dukes to speak to the bill. Thank you, Madam Speaker. It is not without hesitation or reservations that I come forth in support of this legislation. You know, you are what you eat. Your health is your wealth. It is imperative and certainly a good idea for us to get young people in our state engaged in understanding agriculture. There is so much that they can acquire just from the knowledge of being able to understand how the vegetables are grown, how fruit is grown, and I think in the long run. It is certainly going to be good for our state. I can remember growing up on a farm and not only growing up there, but understanding how food is produced. We continually keep gardens and if you ever want to eliminate a food desert, grow your own tomatoes. Thank you, Madam Speaker. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee has agreed to show this bill now pass. All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill. The yes were 162. The nays were zero. The bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. The house will be at ease for about five minutes and the speaker encourages members to remain on the floor in the any room. Thank you.\n\nyou you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you now coach smart is only a very tight schedule, but I told them I said, you know there's not maybe not many times during my career here as a speaker that I'll have the opportunity to introduce a coach of the long long introduction here. Not really. I'm going to show a little clock management here, Coach. I like that. I'm not going to hold you or the members of the body. First of all I want to say that everything I know about leadership, I have learned from Coach Smarts half-time lectures in the locker room at football games since he's been at Georgia. Some great learning there. But out of respect for his schedule I want to say thank you for taking time out of your incredibly busy schedule to visit with us here today. I want to say thank you for the amazing job that you have done in establishing the University of Georgia as one of the very very top programs this year the top program in the nation. And we're all bulldogs now. I'm looking to make sure. And I want to thank you the team and the staff for a magical 2021 season that was kept off by Georgia winning the national championship by defeating Nick Saban and Alabama. It's it's leads me to say it is great to be a Georgia bulldog today. Please welcome Coach Kirby Smart to the podium. Order order please order. I said that. You say order. That would you say come to order. Yeah. Yeah. Hit that gal right there. Sit right there. Hey. It's an honor to be here. It's a privilege to be here. I'm honored to be the University of Georgia head football coach. Great pleasure to be that. That's something I've always tried to want to do in my career and we've got an opportunity to do it at a great place. But you don't win championships without support and you don't win championships without team effort. And President Morehead Josh Brooks have been tremendous support for all our athletic programs. I've been to bring this support for myself and our program and the people in this room that support this great state attracts a lot of players from all over the country as well as our state. They want to come to the state of Georgia. That's usually a good sign of leadership. The leadership in this room has driven the state for a lot of years. We're trying to do a lot of the same things you're doing over at our place in Athens. And we don't get that without tremendous support. We started our workouts towards next year. That's why I don't always like events like this because I want to be focused on next year not last year. And if you sit too long that guy over there across the state line will catch up with you. So the idea is to stay ahead. And the big thing for us is looking forward to next year. And that's kind of where we're at. We had 6 a.m. workouts this morning and our guys are out there grinding as hard as they can. But we want to keep University of Georgia growing both academically, athletically and every facet. And we can't do it without the support of the people in this room. So thank you so much for being here and go dogs! The House will come back to order. Mr. Clark you want to ring the bell a time or two? Let's get some order back here. Back to work. Till Coach Smart comes back next year to celebrate the National Championship. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1302. House Bill 1302 by Rose. At the bottom of the 72nd and others to be titled an act to manage after 7, 4, 80, the Fisher go to Georgia. And it's a related income taxes. So it's a provider one time tax credit for individual tax barriers who file income tax returns for both 2020 and 2021. Taxable years is bill haven't referred to the committee on ways and means. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes the governor's four-liter representative bonner to present the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I appreciate the opportunity to celebrate two historic thanks today. Not only the National Championship from University of Georgia, but now an opportunity to give the tax payers their money back. Mr. Speaker today I rise to present House Bill 1302. A key priority in Governor Kimps legislative agenda this session. House Bill 1302 presents a unique opportunity for our general assembly to put $1.6 billion back in the pockets of hardworking Georgians. This bill allows qualified tax payers who filed an individual tax return in 2020 and 2021 to receive a refund when they file taxes this year. Single filers will receive $250. Head of household filers will receive $375. And married couples filing jointly will receive $500. Georgians with a tax liability less than the amount I just mentioned would receive a refund equal to their 2020 tax liability. This refund would also be subject to set off debt collections such as delinquent child support payments. Qualified tax payers did not need to take any additional action to receive this refund besides filing of their 2020 and 2021 returns. House Bill 1302 is a fulfillment of our belief that when government takes in more money than it needs surplus funds should be sent back to the tax payers. Ultimately it is our citizens not our government who move our state forward and know how to best spend their hard earned money. Governor Kimps decision to reopen our economy has already let us to record low unemployment and record high job creation numbers. This refund gives our state another opportunity to lead in the great recovery. With that Mr. Speaker I will yield for any questions and ask your favorable consideration for House Bill 1302. Do you yield for questions? I do. Chair recognizes representative McLauren to your right for a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker. It does gentleman you. I do. I think you will hear Democrats say a lot. We are not going to object to putting dollars in the pockets of working people because of some of the reasons you identified but you also said that when the state takes in more money than it needs that it is important to give it back. Would you agree after watching the budget hearings listening to agency after agency talk about how star of their budgets have been historically how difficult it is to have retention policies in place to keep people to prevent 90% turnover in some cases. Would you agree with me that currently our government does not have the money it needs to operate at a basic level and that this type of measure is giving away money that actually the government does need to function. I don't agree with the premise. I do believe that we go through a budgeting process and we have shown a very successful budgeting process over the years and I would also submit that government would spend every dollar that they take out of the taxpayers' hands. I think it's important that it opportunities that are available to us to return that money we do that. Well Jim and you'll for one final question. Yes thank you I appreciate that.\n\nI mean, I guess my question would be outside of election year politics and the idea that we want to look like we're making a big investment in the public, whether we are or we aren't. I mean, is the governor committed to looking seriously at retention issues and agency budgeting issues over the long term to study them so that we can be competitive with the private sector so that we don't have correctional officers, juvenile facilities leaving because the conditions are that bad. I mean, can we get the commitment from the governor to study this issue and make sure the government does have what it needs? I would suggest that the governor studies that each and every year and that's again, that's why we have a process. He hears from all the department heads. We as a legislator, legislator hear from all the department heads and we take their feedback and work with our partners in the Senate to create a budget that makes sense and I believe that's borne out over the last few years. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Through that, Mr. Speaker, I will ask for your favorable consideration to return a historic amount to the taxpayers of Georgia. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered to chair here's none? The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee Substitute, the chair here's none, the Committee Substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here's none, the report of the committee. Is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. What purpose does representative dry or rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Mr. Speaker, I just want to clarify that this HV-1302 refunding money to taxpayers looks just like the Biden stimulus plan that was passed in March 2021. So I appreciate Governor Kent following that example of leadership. I want to show a great restraint here and say if the gentleman believes that to be true, it doesn't make it true. What purpose does chairman Houston rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Isn't it not true if these people who are talking about not the people of Georgia not needing extra money, apparently they haven't been to the grocery store or the gas tank and fill the car up? Isn't it not true? We've never seen inflation like this in 40 years and it's not our Governor's fault. He's trying to help the taxpayers of Georgia. Thank you. Okay. We keep this up. We're going to next go on to trying to solve the Russian Ukrainian war. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 1302. The eyes are 148. The days are 18. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. The clerk will read the caption to House Bill 389 was carried over from yesterday's calendar. House Bill 389 members, though Jones the 25th me title and act to amend chapter 8 of title 34 of the fiscal to Georgia and to interrelated employment security so as to change the definition of employment to include services before by an individual for wages. This bill I refer to the Committee on Industry and Labor that committee recommends a disbilled do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Todd Jones to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon, colleagues. Congratulations to the Georgia Bulldogs for those of you who are alums and fans. I say that as respectfully as I can. On HB 389, this is essentially if there was a title to a bill, it would be in my mind, it would be the small and medium-sized business bill. This is a worker classification bill providing for in section 1, I think a much more efficient way to be able to help our small and medium-sized businesses classify between the W2 and a 1099. Later on in section 1, we do have a carve out for the gig economy, primarily on the logistic side and the delivery side and the ride share side. Finally in section 1, what you'll see is we put at the very bottom of all the definitions, if you would read the entire statutes about eight pages long, we asked the department to look at all of the attributes in their totality as opposed to looking at one over the other. And then finally in section 2, one of the things that we consistently hear from our medium-sized businesses across the state is that there are no real penalties for someone who misclassifies, so we wanted to be able to provide the department with the ability to enact those penalties and of course give the department the leeway to be able to waive those penalties if they think that it was something that was done just strictly innocently or maybe it was just a first-time mistake with people who are putting together a business for the first time and we understand that they might be more focused on their core business versus what's happening in the back office. At that point, Mr. Speaker, that is the end of my presentation. I would ask for all of you to favorably consider what I call the small and medium-sized business classification bill. Do you yield for questions? I'll yield for a question. Chair recognizes representative Holly up in the gallery for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? The gentleman? Yes, sir. Sorry, the gentleman, excuse me. It's mass, kind of funny. But do you agree that by passing this measure forward, this is going to make it so that Georgia can at least foster a better business climate to ensure that every business pays his fair share in our department of revenue gets its due money? Yes, representative Holly and I think we're here from further speakers on this bill. This absolutely creates a level playing field. That's what we want in the state. We want all of our small and medium-sized businesses to understand that we've created the floor of the Roman Coliseum, but we made it level. We didn't basically weigh it to either side, but thank you very much for the question. At this time, Mr. Speaker, I know there's other people who would like to speak on the bill. I yield the well. The gentleman has yielded the well, Chair, recognizes Chairman Petrie to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And ladies and gentlemen, the House, I rise the day to speak to this measure and speak in favor of this measure from the perspective of an entrepreneur and to my good friend, representative, really, back there. That's a businessman. But my friends, I have spent my entire lifetime as an entrepreneur. It's all I've ever done and I've had the opportunity from starting with myself as the only employee to being a very large employer. And I've had the opportunity to live the American dream, my friends. But my first view of entrepreneurship was through my grandfather, my granddaddy, J.L. Petrie, senior, who was the son of a sharecropper and who became a bricklayer. And in the 50s sometime, well before I was born, he started a little company called J.L. Petrie Masonry Company. And he had nine children. My daddy, the oldest of nine, seven boys, two girls, I was the oldest of the oldest and all of us learned how to lay brick. I worked with my grandfather through school and I spent a lot of time with him. And I remember how important it was that he was able to raise nine children. He never employed more than about eight or nine people. But he raised nine children with no help from anybody but his own labor, no support from government because he believed he had lived the American dream, my friends. And I remember my grandmother doing the books on the kitchen table. She did her payroll and she was meticulous. And she'd show up on Fridays to hand out those checks. This was ingrained in me as a young man in high school and college as I worked my way through school, laying brick. And it was powerful to me. Anyway, I went off down the road. Obviously, I didn't want to lay brick in 102 degree weather in August, rest of my life. I have been able to live the American dream. But I tell you all that to say this, my friends. Nobody has more respect for the opportunity and the beauty of free market capitalism to rise everyone up than I think myself and many of us in this room. But that whole story I tell you to say this. Nothing so distorts the beauty of free market capitalism than cheating. Nothing. And when we allow employers to misclassify workers, we corrupt the system. Employers that are misclassified workers cheat their employees. Yes. But they don't just cheat their employees. They cheat their competitors. They cheat their competitors. They put them at an unfair disadvantage. They also, as was said earlier, they cheat taxpayers and they cheat our state treasury. My friends, the opportunity that is created by free market capitalism in this country is so important that we have to make sure that it's fair and that it is on a level playing field. And that in my opinion is just what this bill is about is about protecting the integrity of the system to make sure that we keep a free market so that all of those different employers, all of those Georgians out there doing business have an opportunity to succeed on the merits. But what you have today are a lot of folks that are cheating. And that's not good for creating opportunity for our people. My friends, I strongly encourage you to support this bill and Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted.

Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 389. The eyes are 162. The nays are six. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 961. Wrathff. Board Member Nogel. Republican in question. Board Member Nogel. The 25th law voted mode number 1. Prior to the bre\u0e44\u0e14 of Board Member Nogel. to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I bring to you today House Bill 961. This bill was introduced in response to the Supreme Court of George's opinion in Austin and Bird versus Hatcher Management LLC, which was issued in August of 2021. So the law as interpreted had been for several years that if a defendant is sued in a case in a jury, a portions damages determines that the defendants maybe, or even a third party, are percentage-wise at fault, that the ultimate amount that's to be paid in the judgment is dependent upon that percentage. And the Supreme Court's interpretation of Georgia law has changed that where now if only one defendant is sued, that defendant shoulders 100% of the cost, even if they had only a smaller percent of their responsibility. So the example I've been given to folks is if I say I'm at a business owners store and I'm the victim of a crime, I'm robbed in the parking lot and I sue the business owner and a jury decides that the person who committed the crime against me is 95% at fault. But the business is only 5% at fault because maybe there was poor lighting, lack of security, things like that. That business, despite only being 5% responsible, has to pay 100% of the damages due to this interpretation. So we've negotiated a resolution to that issue. It's presented here. I want to thank all the parties who were involved in the negotiations, which really started back in November of last year. And we bring to you today a solution that to my knowledge has no opposition right now from anyone. There was a letter that was put out on the desk as well. I have a copy of it here, but it had approximately 55 different organizations, businesses, insurers, chambers of commerce that all express support for the legislation. And I'd ask for your favorable consideration at this time. Mr. Speaker, I'd be happy to answer any questions. You have no questions. I yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair hears none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair hears none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote aye of those opposed to vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machines? What purpose does representative Rolinsky rise? Thank you, Speaker. I'd like to invoke the Chokis Rule. I'm sorry. Chokis Rule, please. Gentlemen, has that right? And the record will so reflect. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine. The passage of House Bill 961, the eyes are 168th and the eyes are zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 974. House Bill 974, by members of the governor of the 19th and others to be entitled to amend chapter 2 of the title 44. The official bill to George Antony relating in recordation and registration of deeds and other instruments so as to require electric filing. The spill ever referred to the committee on judiciary, that committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative Gullet to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. House Bill 974 requires that clerks accept e-filing of real estate documents. These are documents like deeds, mortgages, leans, maps, plats, things like that. It also creates a standardized page one that includes essential data needed for filing by the clerk. E-filing is more secure, more timely for both the filer and the clerk. It reduces rejected filings by alerting filers to common mistakes made and generally creates efficiencies in the clerk's office. This version of the bill also still allows walk-in filings that was an agreement and compromise in judiciary committee. And that's all this bill does, Mr. Speaker. I'm happy to answer any questions. You have no questions. I yield the bill. Thank you so much. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair hears none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The Chair hears none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair hears none. The report of the committee has agreed to.

If so, the clerk will lock the machines. On the passage of House Bill 974, the eyes are 164. The nays are three. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1009. House Bill 1009, motion of Jones the 25th to be entitled to amend the 40th of the fiscal to Georgia and to add a related motor vehicles and traffic so it's authorized use of personal delivery devices to transport cargo within this state. This bill has been recommended to committee on motor vehicles that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes chairman Todd Jones to present the bill. Good afternoon again colleagues. This is an exciting bill. HB 1009. This effectively drives Georgia further into the 4th industrial revolution. This is an opportunity for us to take a leadership position in personal delivery devices also known as robots. This bill has been recommended to pass by committee on motor vehicles that committee can actively if you can imagine logistics companies, delivery companies using robots on our sidewalks, our bite pass being permitted to crosswalks etc. That's what this bill does. It also provides for operator in terms of who can operate how they can be operated has a minimum threshold in terms of insurance and then ultimately has several safety mechanisms built in including but not limiting to flashing lights, strobes, emitting sounds etc. I truly appreciate your favorable consideration of this bill. I think this allows us to really take a step forward in terms of what we're doing not just with robots but ultimately with autonomous vehicles and eventually drones and I would appreciate your favorable consideration. You got a number of questions a lot. Do you yield? Mr. Speaker due to the time I'm going to yield the well right now. Thank you so much. I'm going to yield it to well. Chair recognizes the minority leader to speak to the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Before I get started first I want to say that I am a technology buff. I believe in automation and I think on the face of this bill it's a good bill up to a point. If you take a look at line 23 if you have in front of you the bill requires an unlatin weight of 500 pounds and I want you to move to line 95 of a speed no greater than 10 miles per hour when it's on a sidewalk so 500 pounds 10 miles an hour. The Newton's first law of motion a body at rest will remain at rest a body emotion will remain in motion unless it's act upon by an external force. So if I'm at rest I'm going to stay at rest if I'm in motion I'm going to stay in motion and less force pushes me up or slows me down 500 pounds at 10 miles per hour is equivalent to 50 pounds at 100 miles an hour. 50 pounds 100 miles an hour has the same force as 500 pounds at 10 miles an hour that's Newton's second law of motion. Imagine being on a small sidewalk and I know there's some provisions around how big a sidewalk could be but in many urban areas in many rural areas sometimes you don't have a sidewalk sometimes a sidewalk is not quite 48 inches on both sides it's small. And so I would like in this bill to what I would call the rich and the rest of us. If you live in a great neighborhood you have great sidewalks. This vehicle can go through to be just fine. Great communities even sidewalks no problem but if you live in some urban areas some rural areas it'd be pretty difficult to have this vehicle with the force of 50 pounds moving at 100 miles an hour. Moving at 100 miles an hour to get out of the way of that automated vehicles in this bill can go as fast as 20 miles per hour in a bike lane 10 miles per hour on sidewalks that's just too fast too fast. Georgia has the fifth most pedestrian fatalities in the nation despite having the eighth largest population as a matter of fact New York had less pedestrian fatalities than Georgia. Georgia is consistently ranked as having among the worst pedestrian infrastructure in the country and now we're going to introduce an object that has a force moving at 50 at 100 miles an hour or 50 pounds. Let me get into the infrastructure to the bill but I want you all to keep that tension in your mind. This bill will allow automated last mile delivery services using unmanned robotic vehicles traveling by sidewalk to deliver packages to individual customers. Further the bill preamps it preamps virtually any attempt at local governments by all county and municipal jurisdictions preventing local governments more familiar with their local infrastructure local control. Infrastructure capabilities and needs from providing any additional regulation of automated vehicles on their sidewalks. Now again automation not bad particularly in the logistics sector however our existing physical infrastructure sidewalks roads are not designed to integrate driverless personalized last last mile not last block not last three blocks last mile for many of Georgia residents. The pedestrian infrastructure is already worse for many folk in my community African American communities who themselves are more likely to be killed in pedestrian traffic accidents. The implementation of driverless vehicles on sidewalks is likely to impact pedestrians full stop. If you want to talk about jobs the last mile is when many folk you see your UPS driver your FedEx driver Amazon will come to your house deliver your package it will effectively eliminate some of the job market as this bill comes on again I believe in automation but we have to think about it holistically and I would I would offer I would posit to many of you that we start thinking about automation in this way as as the author the bill said. The fourth iteration of industrialization we should think about woven cities and not just piece milling it through and woven cities if you think about woven cities you can take a look at you all can Google it and take a look at Toyota they talk about woven cities a better way to deliver packages within this space. Automation needs to be integrated in a holistic matters what I just said but here's the thing where I think you could actually offer some substitutes and I would recommend that the author think about this require a permit for any company which seeks to use automated delivery permit. Limit the number permits an individual company may possess like gates at the airport how many you limit limit the number permits available in the state so as to prevent overcrowding a pedestrian infrastructure. Make sure these robots can only actually operate on six feet sidewalks and industrial areas and limit the speed limit the speed to three miles an hour if you want to sidewalk that lowers the force that can impact the public. I'm going to vote against this bill because I think it needs a little bit more work and I would encourage my neighbors and my friends to do the same thank you Mr. Speaker I yield a well. Gentlemen is yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered the chair here's none the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute the chair here's none the committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill. The chair here's none the report of the committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote I those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does representative bonner rise. Parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Speaker is it not true that one of the beneficiaries of this bill is a company is a grocery store called nourish and bloom market located right outside of Trillis studios which is described as the first contactless grocery store to open in the south and the first black owned autonomous market of its kind in the world. If the gentleman so states it sounds like he knows where off he speaks. What purpose does chairman carpenter rise. Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Is it not true that every member of this house wants to eat hot food and if you lower that miles per hour down then I'm afraid your food will arrive cold. I don't think I'm going to try that one.\n\nWhat purpose does representative McLeod rise? Parliamentary inquiry. I'm concerned about the accident with this particular device and who is responsible for coverage and who buys this? Is it not true? If the lady so states, I'm sure she is concerned about those things. Let's do about one more and then we're going to move on. What purpose does chairman Corbett rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not true that the author of the bill worked closely with ACCG and GMA? We sent this bill back to committee and they worked on all the issues that was objected to by the minority leader. And if you're looking section three that gives the local authorities the ability to enforce rules and regulations in reference to your concerns. Thank you. Gentlemen, so states have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines. On the passage of House Bill 1009, the eyes are 112. The nays are 53. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1188. House Bill 1188. The representative from the 122nd to be entitled to amend the Code Section 1664. The official go to Georgia and intending relating the child molestation and aggravated child molestation. So it was provided that each act of child molestation shall be charged as a separate offense. This bill emreferred the committee on judiciary and on civil committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes representative Lot to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I rise today to present House Bill 1188. It is unfortunate that we must address the issue of child pornography and child molestation at all. And yet because there are horrific people committing these heinous crimes, we must. HB1188 is a top priority for Governor Kim, as well as our GBI crimes against children unit. It is eight lines that clarify his language and code so that each child pornographic image or material, and each area of a child that is sexually touched during child molestation acts, will constitute separate offenses. Prior to 2018, this is how these cases had been charged. But in 2018, a Supreme Court judgment on a different matter decided that the word any currently in code would mean that no matter the number, only one charge would apply. That Supreme Court decision relating to the word any has since been applied to the way in which we charge those accused of child molestation and child pornography. No matter the number of images, one, ten thousand or more, or the number of body locations sexually molested or penetrated, only one charge could be applied with that new ruling. HB1188 clarifies language so that this newly created injustice to children is corrected. Without question, each body part or image will now be charged as a separate offense. There is no more heinous crime than those committed against children, and the victims of such horrific crimes are living a life sentence of trauma. Please support HB1188 so that our prosecutors and our judges may now appropriately apply justice for these victims. I yield for questions, Mr. Speaker. You do not have any questions. Thank you. We have another member that wished to be heard on the bill. The chair recognizes Representative McLauren to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'll get the surprise out of the way and go ahead and say I'm voting for this bill. But I want to take the opportunity briefly, hopefully, to say that in this type of a conversation, there's only two options on the board, right? Green or red, yes or no? When you're in committee for a bill like this, the mood changes, right? It's not like other bills. You hear the way that people relate to these issues, people who have personal experience prosecuting these horrific cases. And there's a dimension to these cases where every person who touches the case, right, or is, you know, related to the case, prosecution, defense, witnesses, victims, everybody suffers trauma in cases like this. A question I asked in committee was, after hearing, you know, prosecutors speak to how traumatic these cases can be even just to look at, right? I mean, you have to imagine to prosecute these cases you have to look at some of the images or hear some of those stories. The question I had in committee is, what are we doing about the mental health of the people who are involved with this system? Because I know that if I had to participate in a case like this, I would not be well. And here's my concern, and this is really the reason I got up here today. Our criminal justice system or criminal legal system is what we do when we have no other options. It's what we do when every other intervention has failed, right? Social, economic, health. And in this type of case in particular, we have no human tools or resources that are adequate to deal with this type of a problem. And so this is one of the most, you know, on point cases in which the criminal legal system's response to something is just, we don't know what to do with this. We just need to throw this person who committed this crime over here and throw them away, essentially. Because what this bill does is it returns to the previous state of the law, but it makes these acts more punishable. It increases the exposure to a point where, you know, imagine 10,000 images or multiple touches, you could basically get a life sentence for somebody if the prosecution and the judge both want it. Right? It's a way of just saying, if you make this type of a mistake, you know, your life is over. And if we do that, if we make that decision, and I'm telling you, I'm joining you in voting yesterday on this, I just think it requires a certain amount of conscience to know that that's what we're doing because we don't have a better alternative in our minds. Right? And so I guess all I would ask the House to do in line with requests I've made before is, let's think about the complex dimensions of a problem like this. And let's start with the mental health of the professionals who do this work on the front lines every single day because here's my wager to you. I wager that if we had more than just six or eight or however many appointments that lawyers get for free with the bar to go see a mental health professional. If we had more than that, if we had actual systems in place to provide mental health support to all the professionals in the system, and the type of family services we need to prevent this type of thing from happening in the first place. If we did that, we would have more confidence, maybe not supreme confidence, but more confidence that when we drop the hammer at the end of it, that it's proportional to what happened. That we're not just saying we're throwing our hands up, we don't know what to do with this tragedy, and we're just sort of throwing the person responsible away entirely. Into broken prisons, into the whole system that I've come up here a few times to talk about. So, like I said, I'm going to vote green today, but it's very hard, I think, for us to engage with this, and we need to embrace that it's difficult and embrace that there's several steps we need to do before we get to this conversation so that we're not traumatizing professionals, victims, members of the public, more than life makes inevitable. And with that, I thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I yield the well. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair hears none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair hears none. The report of the committee has agreed to shall this bill now pass. All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 1188. The eyes are 163. The nays are zero.
