  "transcript": "a civil thought in leadership at the University System of Georgia, 375,000, 41.15.5 reduced funds\nfor summer programming. That's a $2.5 million decrease due to decreased utilization and\neffectiveness. 41.15.6 was a reassignment of $3 million that was to go to two law schools.\n41.15.7 is a reduction of 700,000. That's due to delayed program implementation there.\n41.15.8 that's just a transfer of the 1.6 million in funding for the Center for\nWorld Prosperity and Innovation from the University System over to the Department of Ag. 41.15.9\nis an additional $600,000 that allows the Georgia Tech computer science program to extend into 10 additional counties across Georgia.\n41.15.10 has increased funds of $100,000 to the Georgia Youth Science and Technology Centers.\n41.15.11 is funds for the dental clinic a long time.\ncome at the, been, Misselle, dental clinic, 577,000.\nThat's used also to teach a lot of our dental college\nof Georgia students, which we are now about to expand\ninto a Savannah campus as well.\nUnder 41.17, 0.5, Skittaway Institute of Oceanography.\nThere's a $326,000 increase to reduce some of the austerity\nreductions that are still left over there\nat the Skittaway Institute on the state side\nfrom COVID reductions.\nAdditionally, some doc electrical and other work\nis $193,000 at 41.17.6.\nUnder teaching 41.18.6,\nincreased funds for Georgia capital history,\npublication of $125,000.\nAnd we will go on over to section 44\nUnder Student Finance Commission of Georgia, you'll see under 44.3.1, an estimate for the correct amount needed to increase funds for projected need that says $17 million, $436,000.\nUnder 44.5, there's a foster care scholarship pursuant to Senate Bill 85 that believes in the House Higher Education Committee.\ncommittee. That doesn't have a dollar amount, but it's contingent on us looking to do additional\nhelp for former foster students. If you're going down to the 44.7, there is a reduction\nof 50,000 in that program that currently have over a million dollars in reserve. So they\ncan fund it. Some changes based on their reserves. Over at 44.10 under hopes, scholarships\nfor private schools.\nThis is kind of related to 44.10 and 44.11 private\nand public.\nThat's an effort to move $10,147,000\nto make the Zell the Hope Private Scholarship Award\nto match the Zell Award in public.\nSo that's just a move of $10,147 million.\nNow at 44.13, that's just a new program of memorial grants.\nIt was originally the public safety memorial grant section,\nbut now that we're adding or potentially adding\nan HP 56 public school employee memorial grant,\nthat's a new program area.\nSo it just moves over $540,000.\nAnd it has a kind of a placeholder\nfor that public school employee memorial grant.\n44.16 is the other side of that $540,000 move\nUnder 44.18, the promised scholarship, there was a maximum amount by legislation of $141 million based on looking at other states and the uptake in the first year.\nTypically, it's around 1%. We, just to be safe, we estimated a 2% uptake of all the eligible students under the current formula, and that would be $45 million, rather than $141 million.\nSo that's the new amount is $45,646,000 there.\nDown at $44.21, that's a request to increase the tuition\nequalization grant from $1,100 to $1,150.\nThey currently have over $5,000,000 in reserves.\nSo it's believed that they can fund that out of their current reserves.\nAnd I believe there's on their technical college system,\nI don't believe we have any new additions or changes.\nI'd answer any questions from the subcommittee.\nIf not, is there a motion?\nI have a motion and a second, any further discussion?\nIf not, all in favor, aye.\nAny pose, likes on?\nWe'll adjourn this, could be on higher education,\nsubcommittee.\nYou\nYou\nGood morning and I'm going to call this meeting to order for the subcommittee on Transportation\nAppropriations and I'm just going to highlight the changes to the governor's recommendation\nstarting with section 47.1.3 and this is an increase to funds for airport aid.\nThis will be the first time in three years that the base funding for airports will have\nbeen increased and just for some perspective, we're still spending 10 times less than our\nneighbors in Florida and we have the same number of airports.\nI'm going to bring you down to second 47.11, the rail program lost $4.8 million in revenue\ndue to the sales tax, fuel tax suspension and the House would like to make them\nhold by zeroing that out and section 47.15 there's no recommendation to the\nchange in funding but we are asking the Atlanta Regional Transit link to\nprovide a report to us just due to the fact that ridership has drastically\nreduce since the pandemic and it's not returned to pre-pandemic levels so we\njust would like to understand better how those dollars are being spent and\nhear their thoughts on how they can make that transit program the most\neffective cost effective and meaningful for the riders they're using it but\nthere's a lot of empty seats on those buses now.

I think we have a quorum and most of you, many of you have been here\nthrough the entire presentation from all the subcommittees. As y'all know, there are\na lot of, we're doing a lot of good things, a lot of expenses in certain places. I just\nI just wanted to, before I did my official comments\nand presented the bill, I wanted to thank all of those\ninvolved in this process, all of those in the House\nbudget research office that have put in.\nY'all just don't know the hours they put in,\nespecially last week, we're getting this done,\nplus crossover and all the committee meetings,\nbecause we have people that work,\nour people in the budget office work,\ncommittees in the budget. So, before we even do anything, I want to thank Christine Murdock,\nall her staff for all the hard work they put in the last few years.\nAnd I'm going to turn it over to the Vice Chairman who's upset that something's not in the budget,\nso maybe he'll call for the vote.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman. I think we'll allow a vote this morning though, but I want to thank\nyou and let's give Chairman Hatchet a round of applause for his hard work.\nAnd I'll now turn it over to you, Mr. Chairman, to present House Bill 68.\nThank you. Two months ago, the Commissioner of the Department of Corrections stood before\nall of us at this podium to present the governor's amended FY25 and FY26 budget\nrecommendations for his department. That day was unprecedented for two reasons.\nFirst, the recommendations were released in advance of session. And second, it was\nan historic infusion of cash that was being recommended for the prison\nsystem. The advanced recommendations and cash infusion highlighted the\nsense of urgency share between both the executive and legislative branches and our need for\nswift action to address the pervasive problems within the prison system.\nYour appropriations public safety subcommittee, led by Chairman Hitchens and supported by\nCourtney George, has spent the last two months combing through the governor's recommendations\nfor the department.\nLast last week, we passed an amended budget that included an infusion of $345 million in\nnew funding for the department.\nMuch of the money appropriated was for staff, but it also included funding for some terms\nwe had never heard before, like Tiger Teams, Maximum Security, Modular Units.\nbudget ads were all designed to enhance staffing and increase bed capacity so that much needed\nrepairs can begin that will make our prisons safer for both inmates and for our officers.\nThe FY26 budget you have for you now builds upon those recommendations. Recognizing that agency needs\nare fluid and ever changing as new information becomes available.\nThe House version of the budget adds an additional $125 million on top of the governor's recommendation\nfor a total increase in next year's budget, the corrections department of $250 million.\nMuch of the funding and the corrections FY26 budget is an annualization of the needs\nwe recognize in the amended budget, included lowering staffing ratios and improving bed\ncapacity so that the department can implement life safety and security projects.\nThis budget also recognizes that salary enhancements are working to attract and retain staff\nin the prison system, and it includes additional salary increases to keep the staffing momentum\ngoing. It also addresses deficits in the corrections budget, where funding for vacant positions\nhas long been used to cover gaps in increased operational costs, including utilities and\nhealth services. Now that the department is having more success at retaining staff, these\nexpenses must be accounted for and made whole in the base budget. Finally, this budget includes\n$38 million in additional funding for private prisons and correctional institutions, recognizing\nthat these entities are in an essential part of the correctional network. Without them,\nwe would not have that capacity for all of our defend offenders.\nWhile this theme of the budget so far has been public safety, this is also very much an\neducation budget. The House supports the governor's recommendation for enrollment growth and\nfully funds the QBE formula, but we also include $98 million in additional education spending above\nthe governor's recommendation, primarily for students safety and mental health.\nThe House budget includes a $25 million investment in new school safety initiatives designed to\nassess and prevent school threats. It also includes more than $60 million for a\nknee program that I'm really excited about called Student Support Services. This\nknee program is a collection of ideas and requests many of you are likely from\nme or with that support our students in ways that the QBE formula can't. This\nThis new program provides $20 million for mental health grants for social workers to\ndo outreach, for mental health grant funding for middle schools and high schools, $5 million\nfor grants for social workers to do outreach and address chronic absenteeism, $10 million\nfor out of school care and programming or boost 2.0 as some of you may know it, and finally\n$28 million to implement a new source of funding\nfor disadvantaged students otherwise known\nas a poverty week.\nTogether, these programs aim to support the whole child\nwith needed services outside of the classroom\nto improve mental health and boost academic achievement.\nFinally, literacy has been a major focus of concern\nfor members in this body as well as in the Senate.\nThat's why the House is included in additional $10 million in funding to implement recommendations\nfrom the Georgia Council on Literacy, including funding for 116 re-sub-based literacy coaches\nto support teachers on the science of reading.\nOf course, in a $37 billion budget, there are numerous ads in other policy areas that\nI know many of you will agree are equally important, and this budget addresses those\nneeds to include a few eight million dollars to CJCC to offset the loss of\nvocal dollars. $6.4 million for a 2% provider rate increase for child\ncaring institutions, child placing agencies, foster parents, and relative\ncaregivers. $3.4 million for 150 new now comp waivers. $32 million in reimbursement\nrate increases for providers treating patients on Medicaid $8.3 million a new\nfunding for graduate medical education including $2.8 million for 150 new\nresidency slots and $5 million to establish a grant program to support new and\nexpanding residency programs and $23.5 million to provide and enhance\nsupplement to our state retirees. This is just a few of the highlights that you\ncan be proud of in the House Committee substitute on HB 68 and I would\nappreciate your favorable consideration. I will simple to answer any questions.\nDo any members have any questions? All right seeing none what's the will of\nthe committee. All in favor? Any opposed? Thank you again, Mr. Chairman, and this meeting\nis adjourned.\nYou\nYou\nYou\nYou\nYou\nYou\nYou\nYou\nYou\nYou\nYou\n",
