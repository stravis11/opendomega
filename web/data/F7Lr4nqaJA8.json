  "transcript": "Good morning.\n>> Good to see all you early risers for\nsure. What a great day the House is\nhaving. We're moving fast here and\nefficiently. So, let's get started on\nthe human resources\nbudget changes. 15.3.\nThis is under behavioral health and\ndevelopmental disabilities. And this is\nthe only change to the governor's\nproposal. This will be for one-time\nfunds for a behavioral health provider\nrate study. This focuses on the now and\ncomp waiverss.\nSo next,\nif you would look at the Department of\nHuman Services,\n28.3.1,\nthis will provide funds for an\nintegrated child welfare reporting\nsystem, something that we have needed\nfor a great time in Georgia, $15\nmillion.\nThe next is at 28.12.1\nfor out ofome care.\nThis will increase the funds for\nutilization growth and increased costs\nof care prioritizing\nreunification services assessments and\nthe specialized services for our high\nacuity youth. This will\nrebuild some of what is missing there.\nThis will be an ad of 82 thou 80. Excuse\nme. We're all running dashing. I'm\nsorry. Sorry. 82741347.\n28.13.1\nfor out ofome care. This is a special\nproject to restore the cancellation of\nstate office contracts for supportive\nservices\nand implement funds to place foster\nyouth closer to their biological\nfamilies as directed in the FY26 budget.\nThis is a million 599601.\nNext, if you would look please at\n28.25.3\n25.3\nto increase the funds to supply new and\nused durable medical equipment and\nassisted technology. This is for the\nfriends of disabled adults, children and\nyouth FODAC, a longtime partner with our\nstate of $125,000.\nThat is all of that budget. Now, if we\nwould look at veterans services.\nSo, there are a couple of things here\nand they are helping each other out. I'm\ngoing to look at some other notes that I\nhave here just a minute to make sure I\nsay this correctly. Okay. So, at 48.2.3\nand 48.3\nyou will see that there are funds moving\nthere.\nThe governor proposed transferring funds\nfrom nursing homes to the cemetery. The\nhouse is going to say no and actually\nadd straight up funds for um for the\ncemetery of a million dollars. This is\nthe funds to create the new veteran\ncemetery in Augusta, Richmond County,\npursuant to HR77.\nThat is 48.2.4.\nAlso at 48.3.4,\nWe're going to recognize savings from\nthe delay in the opening of new beds.\nThere's a cost savings here. There are\n17 beds that still remain open. And so\nwe are going to save a little bit of\nmoney there.\nThen if you'll look at 48.4.3,\nthis will be to provide funds for\ntechnology platform for our community\nservice referral. Unite us is a social\nservice platform that has been working\nvery successfully with our veterans and\nwe want to continue to support them with\n2,614\n$598.\nAnd then last at 48.4.4\nwe're going to partner with the Shepherd\nCenter initiative. They are doing great\nwork to help with some of our military\nveterans and wounded ser service members\nparticularly and mental health and brain\ninjuries. So, we will be um sending a\nmillion dollars that way in the House\nbudget. Thank y'all so much.",
