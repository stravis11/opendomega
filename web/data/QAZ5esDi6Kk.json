  "transcript": "They are convening, having arrived, all members of the House will please report to their assigned\nseats.\nAll members of this House will please report to their seats, the clerk will ring the bell.\nYou\nAll right, we're going to have the morning roll call.\nAll members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber\nand the clerk will unlock the machines.\nAll members voted have all members voted\nIf so the clerk will lock the machines\nDoorkeepers will please close the doors and keep them closed\nI usually begin by wishing you a good morning, and we'll do that, so good morning.\nBut I know this morning that I share with you the outrage and the shock and grief over\nthe senseless violence which claimed the lives, yes to afternoon, of eight people, most\nto whom were Asian-American.\nAs a society, we cannot tolerate this lawlessness.\nOnly evil can walk into a small business and wantonly gun down innocent people.\nThere will be plenty of opportunity to determine motive and all the circumstances surrounding\nthese hideous crimes. Our justice system will work. But today is a day to remember. It's\na day to remember the lives of eight people to mourn their loss and to lift up their family\nand friends in prayer. May God bless and comfort them during this most difficult time. Thank\nThank you very much.\nWe will begin our day now with Scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we\nwill pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.\nOur chaplain this morning will be introduced by the lady from the 131st House District\nRepresentative Beth Kemp, Representative Kemp.\nGood morning.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the House.\nPastor Billy Smith is a friend to everyone.\nHe is one of the most humble people that I know.\nWhen I asked Pastor Billy if he would come and speak with us\nand send me his bio, he simply sent me three sentences.\nLike I said, he is very humble.\nPainting on the wall of the massive entry space\nat the new church building, it was just finished last summer,\nis the phrase saved people, serve people.\nAnd it commands attention.\nPastor Billion, his team, and the members truly\nlived by this message.\nI came to know Pastor Billy because I\nwas a volunteer in the backpack program, which\nChristchapel orchestrates, it's a multi-faceted outreach program, and they help kids who\nhave food insecurity. Kids who don't have food on the weekends, and these volunteers\ncome and they love and we pack this food, they bring it to the schools, and very discreetly\nis this food given out via teachers and school buses. During the pandemic, Christchapel\ncovertly delivered many roles of toilet paper. Maybe not because people needed\nthe toilet paper, but as a way to show that they were being thought of.\nPastor Billy and his team wanted to share the good news even during the pandemic.\nSo one Sunday morning I received a text from a dear friend saying if you want\nto come to church come to the field across from the school. And when I got there\nI was shocked. There were hundreds of cars. Everyone had their windows down and they had every speaker they possibly could\nso everyone would have an opportunity to hear the good news of the gospel.\nChrist Chapel loves people and encourages community building by serving others as Christ showed through his example\nBoth spiritually and temporally. The scripture comes to mind, Matthew 7-20.\nwherefore, by their fruit, ye shall know them. Billy Smith does not have to tell\nothers about his church. He simply shows them. Billion his wife Tina started\nChristchafel Community Church in Zebulin in 2003. Christchafel has about 2,000\npeople attending in services. His family consists of his wife Tina, of course,\nand four beautiful children, Cole, Laney, Max and Ruby, and at this time I would\nto introduce Pastor Billy Smith.\nI almost had to hug my representative\nto make it to the podium there.\nHey, good morning everybody.\nIt's great to see you.\nThanks for the leadership\nfor allowing me to be here today\nand for my representative for the invitation.\nI'm a stickler for rules,\nsays five minutes. You can go ahead and start your clock. I'll be done on time.\nI was just asked by my church to make sure I took an offering up before I left. I said, I don't think.\nI don't think that's going to happen up there. Be careful if you want to be asked back, right?\nBut there is an old proverb. He who is short-winded shall be heard again.\nAnd that works for us on the weekends around our place.\nSeveral weeks ago I was upstairs at our house and I was given my two youngest\nchildren the what-for. They're 11 and 9. If you have kids at age you know that\nthey compete. Everything's a competition from who can dress the quickest, who\ncan eat the fastest, who can get the car in the car, you know first, then I was\njust talking to them about their attitude. They'd really been at each other and\nI told them some of these things that I think are important. I said hey you're\nattitude can make or break you. And your attitude can heal or hurt you. It'll make you friends or to make you enemies.\nYour attitude can make you happy or miserable. It can make you a success or failure. And when I got done talking to him, I felt really good about myself.\nI'm like, that's a good, bad moment. Until I went to descend the stairs back to the main floor of our house and I was overly convicted about talking to my kids about their attitude when mine had been pretty sorry lately.\nThere's a story of an old grandfather who was having a couple of his grandkids over\none weekend and he was going to take a nap.\nThey had been out playing but they came in and they found some Lynn Burger cheese.\nI don't know if you know about that but it stinks.\nAnd while he was napping they put it on his mustache and when he woke up he just kind\nof jolted and said, man this bedroom stinks.\nHe walked out into the hallway and slammed the door and then declared that the hallway\nstunk as well.\nWent into the parlor of the living room and said the living room stinks.\nWent outside to the porch and took a big breath thinking he would get a clean breath of\nair and then declared the whole world stinks.\nBut it didn't.\nThe grandfather stunk.\nHe had to own that.\nAnd often when it comes to my attitude, I'm pointing to people around me and I'm really\nthe problem.\nThere's some things about attitude today that I want to share with you just briefly that\nI think are important in our office every now and then somebody will come in in the morning\nThey'll have a rough day maybe a rough commute or maybe they had an argument with a spouse\nBefore they got there and and they say these words I just got up on the wrong side of the\nBed I love it when they say that because I'm always prepared. I want you to go home\nI want you to undress get in the bed\nroll over, get up on the right side of the bed, read, dress, and come back to work\nbecause we want to work with the attitude of Christ with all that we do at our\nchurch. Just three things quickly. Number one, your attitude reveals the real\nyou. I don't like that. I don't always like the way I respond, but that's what's in\nmy heart. Proverbs says this in the 23rd chapter, for a man thinks in his\nhard. So he is. My heart exposes my attitude. There was a guy in education, a teacher who was\ndoing an illustration for his class and he brought in a Mason jar, a canning jar for\ny'all who are in rural areas like I am. And he filled it up with water and he left the lid\njust loose on it. He walked into the classroom and he began to shake it violently and he said,\ndoes anybody know why does this water come out of this jar and one of the\nstudents raised her hand and said yes because you didn't tighten the lid and\nhe said you're right another student said it's because you're shaking it\nteach if you would just quit shaking it it would stop spilling out another\nkid said no it's science you know it's gravity you shaking the can and and\nwhen you shake it it rises and what rises falls it's just coming out and he said\nwell all of you are right there's a bigger picture water is coming out of the\nbecause water is what's in the jar.\nAnd unfortunately, when we're shaken in life,\nthe real attitude and the real heart is exposed\nduring those difficult seasons of our life.\nWhen we are shaken, what comes out of us is who we really are.\nThere was a man working on a project at his house one day\nand he had a bunch of people watching.\nThey were admiring his work and he was hammering away\nand he hit his thumbnail.\nI don't know if anybody's ever done that before,\nbut he hit his thumbnail and he kind of danced around\nand he kept saying, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.\nAnd I don't know that it would have been the first thought\nthat came to my mind, but that was what he was saying.\nAnd somebody asked him,\nhe said, why do you keep saying that?\nHe said, because that's what's in me.\nWhat's in us during difficult times\nis exposed on the outside of us.\nNumber two, attitude determines the success and failure\nof every relationship we have.\nWhether that's with our wives or husbands or spouses\nor kids or friends or coworkers,\nall of those relationships are either strengthened\nstrengthen or they're weakened by good or bad attitudes.\nAnd the Old Testament in the book of Numbers,\nthere's a guy named Moses, maybe you remember him,\nwho went up on the mountain, got the 10 commandments,\ncame back down, then the Israelites\nout of Egyptian captivity,\npretty important Old Testament guy.\nBut he had some family members\nwho had a really bad attitude, Miriam and Aaron.\nNow, their excuse for the attitude was\nthat he had married outside of their tribe,\nbut that was just their excuse.\nThey were really jealous that Moses had been given permission\nGod to lead. See, the leaves on the tree were, hey, you married outside of the\ntribe, but the root was jealousy. Here's what I'm trying to say today. Is there\nfamily relationships, our work relationships? All of those are determined where\nthey're going to be good, bad, poor, or healthy based off, based off our attitudes.\nThe third and final thing is this. Attitude is always our choice. Nobody controls\nour health and our emotions, but us. It's always our choice. Often you'll\nhear people say, I just had a bad day. Well, those circumstances don't determine\nyour attitude. We do. I love a guy one time who was asked the question about his\ncollege career, about his academics. They said, were you in the top half of the\nclass? And he said, no, I'm sorry to say I wasn't in the top half of the class,\nbut I'm happy to announce that I was in the part of the class that made the\ntop half possible. Right? There's summa cum laude and then there's thank you\nlotto. Has anybody with me this morning? Right? Just thankful I got out. But his\nattitude was this, you know what? I didn't finish in the top half, but I did\nfinish. There was a holocaust survivor named Dr. Victor Franco. Endured the\nunimaginable. When he got to the concentration camp, they took his clothes\naway from him. They took his watch. They took his wedding ban that his wife had given him on his\nwedding day and they tried to take his dignity. But what they couldn't take was his attitude.\nHe says he survived not because he was stronger than everybody else but because he had an attitude\nthat reflected joy, hope, and positivity. One last thing and then we're going to pray together.\nEvery morning, across this nation, two birds leave looking for a meal.\nOne's a vulture, and he's looking for things that are dead and rotten and things that smell.\nAnd guess what? He finds it.\nBut over the same deserts in our country every day, hummingbirds also leave looking for a meal.\nThey're looking for something that's sweet and something that's fresh and something that's good and wholesome.\nthem. And guess what? They find it. And I think today when it comes to my attitude and yours,\nit sounds like a, this sounds like a kids church sermon doesn't it? But the more I talk about\nattitude, the more I realize it isn't for kids. It's for grown folks like me. I'm just asking you\ntoday to evaluate throughout the day how you treat people, how you honor people, how you love\nand care for people. Today is the anniversary of my dad passing away. He passed away one year,\nwhen you're a go-to-day, have his towel in his honor.\nI wanted to do that today.\nOne thing my dad left me, we weren't rich,\nwe were just rural middle-class family,\nbut he taught me you get up every day.\nYou treat people fair, you treat people right,\nand you determine your own attitude.\nI'm just asking you to do the same today.\nLet's reflect the attitude, the heart, and the mind of Christ.\nThank you so much for an opportunity today.\nWill you battle and let's pray?\nFather, today, thank you for this house and what it represents.\nWe have an incredible nation and a great state, and I'm so proud of what's happened here\nover the course of the last year during a very difficult season.\nMaybe our country's most difficult.\nMan, but the hardship and the perseverance has done nothing but make us stronger and make\nus better.\nI pray for every house member who's here today.\nI pray for their families and their homes.\nI pray that you bless them and you keep them safe.\nAnd I pray those things in Christ's name.\nAnd we all say together, amen.\nWe're going to do the pledge.\nAllegedly, we just feel the flag of the United States of America\nand due to the Republic for which\nAnd one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\nDoorkeepers will unlock the doors.\nYou\nChair recognizes Chairman Hogan, the Chair of the Committee on Information and Audits.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nYour Committee on Information and Audits has read the journal of a previous legislative\nday and found it to be correct.\nAnd furthermore, Mr. Speaker, a cup of Irish blesses for you today.\nMay the good Lord take a liking to you, but not too soon.\nIf you're lucky enough to be Irish, you're lucky enough.\nWords to live by.\nChairman Hogan, the Chair of the Committee on Information and Audits reports that the\nThe journal, the previous legislative day, has been read and found to be correct.\nIs there any objection to the confirmation of the journal?\nThe chair here's none, and the journal is confirmed.\nThe clerk will read the resolution establishing the order of business for the day.\nMr. Brown's on a 59, who's following me establishes the order of business during the first\npart of the period unanimous consents, introduction of bills and resolutions, first reading in reference\nof House bills and resolutions, second reading of bills and resolutions, reports of standing\ncommittees, first reading and reference of Senate bills and resolutions, morning orders.\nIs there any objection to the adoption of the resolution establishing the order of business\nfor the day?

But before, before we have morning orders, the chair wants to recognize our newest\nHouse member, Representative Angela Moore from the 90th House District. Welcome to the\nGeorgia House.\nGoing on now to morning orders, Chair recognizes for a morning order.\nIf you have no interest in the morning orders, that's fine, but just step outside in case\nthere are people in here that wish to hear them.\nrecognizes for a morning order, Chairman Mandy Ballinger.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nYesterday, on March 16th, a violent disturbed man perpetrated a heinous series of murders,\nkilling six Asian women and two whites.\nAs a former victim advocate, my heart goes out to the victims of this senseless act.\nMy job at the time was used to be to assist victims of crime like this.\nI am intimately familiar with a sense of staggering loss and long road to recovery, as family\nand friends of the lost face.\nBut I have confidence that Georgia's prosecutors will hold this man accountable for these heinous\nacts.\nassisted by the tools given to them by the General Assembly,\nsuch as the hate law we passed last year.\nLet us have a moment of silence to remember the victims.\nThank you.\nChair recognizes representative Charlise Bird\nfor a morning order representative bird.\nGood morning. I stand here to bring light to the tragic events that occurred\nyesterday evening. It is heart-wrenching to think of the families of those\nmany of whom were women were killed and injured at the shooting that happened\nat the Asian-owned run business in Cherokee County, my own district.\nThis is a horrific event and I am thankful to the Sheriff's Office\noffice who quickly identified and apprehended the suspect. I too live not far from these tragic\nevents that happened. First and foremost, I am an American, but I proudly recognize my Chinese\nheritage and my culture every day. My dad, a full-blooded Chinese, married my mother who is Irish\nEnglish in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1949. Something very unheard of in those days.\nAnd in fact, it was called a mixed marriage. In fact, the Chinese population was\nrelatively small because of the Chinese Exclusion Act signed by the president\nauthor in 1882 and was not repealed until 1943. I really didn't think much about being Chinese\nuntil my siblings and I started elementary school. We didn't look like everyone else. Our skin\ncolor was different with dark, slanted eyes. At recess, the boys most cruel by pretending to\nshoot us with machine guns, that's what we heard on most days at recess hurtful\nyes painful yes scars yes we too suffered by the people who are ignorant and\nfilled with hate obviously kids back then heard discussions at home about World\nWar II and the horrible Japanese people, thus the beginnings of prejudice right in your\nown home with your own family.\nI certainly, my parents taught me to embrace our differences, stand strong and never let\nanyone get the best of you.\nI was also reminded this morning of words in our Bible study,\nsticks and stones may break my bones,\nbut words will never harm me.\nBevin Jean, my parents, taught us Jesus\nloves the little ones, red, yellow, black, and white.\nMy prayers go out to the family of the victims,\nAnd I hope they get the justice they deserve.\nPlease join me for a moment of silence\nfor all of these victims for the senseless crimes\ncommitted last evening.\nMr. Speaker, I will yield the well.\nChair recognizes representative Noel Williams\nfor a morning order.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nI rise today wanting to, of course, say how sick\nand we all were to what happened yesterday afternoon\nand in the evening.\nAnd I just wanted to commend my sheriff in Crisp County\nand the Georgia State Patrol of Eggs at 101.\nBy doing the duty that lies nearest, they protect us.\nAt 3 o'clock this morning, my sheriff had a phone call.\nThey apprehended the subject on I-75 this morning.\nAnd I just want to say to you all how proud we are of our law enforcement, our Georgia State Patrol.\nThere does not a day goes by that we do not need to thank them.\nAnd we are certainly certainly sickened by what happened yesterday.\nAnd may God hold them in the palm of His hands.\nThank you.\nto recognize his representative will wade for a morning order.\nGood morning. I rise today to pay honor to my father.\nHe passed on Thursday night but right now he's he's he's in heaven and to those\nreps that are from the Sumter County area and the making city of making and\nthen myself being in Dawson County that was the history that my dad and his\nlegacy had in this state his family settled in Sumter County in the 1700s but\nBut today I rise to tell you that I'm thankful for the man that taught me to feed love and\nstarve hate.\nHe showed students who lived in homes in my community that still had dirt floors in the\n70s and 80s that they could do anything that they put their mind to.\nHe was an educator.\nRoy Wade was the tallest man in Dawsonville.\nat six foot nine in his heyday, every child looked at him as a giant, but he was gentle.\nMy message is for you today, especially given the events of yesterday, ring true and what\nmy dad taught me.\nAnd I want to share it with you and remind every one of us of the message that he taught\nmyself and my brother and every student that ever had his fifth grade in my class.\ninto this. Good Lord made all of us in his image and what he made is beautiful. And I\nlook to each of you, each of you are beautiful because you are what God has made. Do your\nbest. Feed love, star of hate. Thank you. Let us pause for a memory of my father. Thank\nThank you.\nChair recognizes Chairman Petri and the Chatham County delegation for a morning order.\nYou, Mr. Speaker, we rise today to wish everyone a happy St. Patrick's Day.\nThis is the second time in history since 1824 that we have not had a St. Patrick's Day\nparade in Savannah, but the people of Irish heritage will always celebrate our patron\nSt. Patrick who brought Christianity to the people of Ireland.\nI also want to make a special thank you and recognition of the honorable Don Hogan who as I understand it was there with St. Patrick as he drove the snakes out of Ireland.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nChair recognizes representative win for a morning order.\nFifty seconds remaining.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nI'm here today to talk about the horrific and violent tragedy that took the lives of eight people at three different Asian businesses in Cherokee in Atlanta.\nOf those eight victims, six were Asian-American women.\nWe don't know the details of the shooting or the motives of the shooting, but we do know in the last year that hate crimes against Asian Americans have increased by 150%.\nAnd of those hate crimes, 68% of them are directed towards Asian-American women.\nThis is a result of xenophobic rhetoric.\nThe labeling of the COVID-19 virus has been longing to or as the fault of China and other\nAsian people.\nSo today, I want to remind us that there has been this history in this country of excluding\nAAPIs, including an exclusion act directed towards an entire continent, the incarceration\nof Japanese-American, the violence against Chinese real workers, and we have been taught\nas Asian-Americans to keep our heads down because our parents believed it was safer for us.\nBut what's happened is that we are now invisible, and when things happen to us, people don't\nspeak up until a tragedy like this one occurs.\nIt is invisibility that hasn't shielded us from hate crimes, xenophobia, or gender-based\nviolence.\nAnd we saw all of these intersections happening yesterday.\nIn the next few days, our priority is getting resources in support to victims of the families\nand respect their needs and their confidentiality.\nAnd we know there is a lot of fear in the Asian American community right now, and we're\nworking together to support the greater community as a whole.\nAnd my ask of this chamber is to stop and call out any xenophobic rhetoric to condemn hate\nagainst any community and to keep these victims and families in your thoughts and prayers.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nI yield the well.\nTime for morning orders, as expired.\nWe are going on now to the rules calendar, going on to the rules calendar.\nPlurker read the caption to House Bill 703.\nHouse Bill 703, members of the math, is the 144th being taught on that to provide the future\nElections for the office of probate judge of blackly county shall be nonpartisan elections\nThis bill I'm refer to the committee on inter-gobble coordination that committee recommends that this bill do pass\nChair recognizes representative mathis to present the bill.

Next Senate Bill 88 supports and enhances a pathway for our veterans to become\nalternatively certified teachers. This bill would also utilize an excess of observational\nresources for new teachers or teachers who need a little extra observation. Some of those\nhigh performing teachers that have had a history and long record of being a quality educator\ndon't need to be observed as much and they can use those resources for new teachers or\nteachers that need a little bit of help. It also improves differentiated instruction and\nreading instruction for future teachers, especially new teachers, with those at-risk\nstudents, some that may have learning disabilities or even for advanced students. And finally\nthis takes this enhances historically black colleges and universities role in teacher\npreparation and programs to make sure that the teachers that are standing in front of\nthe classroom are representative of what the communities look like where they're leading\nthese children. So Mr. Speaker, this bill speaks for itself. If there are no questions,\nI would ask for your favorable consideration. You do not have any questions. Thank you,\nMr. Speaker.

If the gentleman so states I will\naccept his comments there have all members voted all members what purpose\nis representative Bayes Moore rise thank you mr. Speaker\ncomment your inquiry is it not true that this bill will you serve local\ncontrol I think that's just a matter that each member is going to have to\ndecide for themselves all right one more parliamentary inquiry if that's what it\nis to what purpose is represented or chairman he's Clark rise parliamentary\ninquiry isn't it true the earlier we had some bills dealing with local control\ndeciding on how to do their elections and some of the people that are voting\nnow voted no then because they wanted a statewide mandate dictating to the\nlocal's how to run their governments.\nI'm sure the gentleman believes that to be true.\nHave all members voted?\nHave all members voted?\nIf so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of Senate Bill 182.\nThe eyes are 100 and three, the nays are 70.\nThis bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed.\nWe'll read the cap to the Senate bill 140, Senate bill 140.\nSenate bill 140 by Senator Mulles, the 53rd hatch of the 50th miller of the 49th harvest\nin the 15th walker of the 20th and others, be tunneled act to men, Chapter 3, Title 50,\nthe fiscal of the Jordan Annettate, everything in the state flag, seal in other symbols, so\nThose are provided replacement of the monument and honor of the honorable Zell Brian Miller\nupon the capital of grounds, the state capital building.\nMs. Bill Evans referred to the Committee on State Properties, that committee recommends\nthat this bill do pass.\nChair recognizes Speaker Ralston to present the bill.\nThank you, Madame Speaker.\nIt is my honor to bring before you today Senate Bill 140, sponsored by the Senate Rules\nChairman.\nThis measure enjoys a long bipartisan list of co-sponsors, including the President,\nProTIM, and the Minority Leader in the Senate.\nIt was unanimously passed by our colleagues in the State Senate.\nBill 140 would erect a statue or other monument on our capital grounds in memory of our 79th\nGovernor and former United States Senator, Zell Brian Miller.\nZell Miller has been called the Governor who gave Georgia Hope more than 1.9 million students\nhave been able to attend college through Georgia's Hope Scholarship Program.\nmore than 1.6 million four-year-olds have attended Georgia's pre-kindergarten program.\nIn total, the Georgia lottery has generated some $23 billion in funds for education in\nour state.\nZell Miller had a vision of a state where your opportunities were only limited by your\nwillingness to work for them.\nHe was a man who, both as an elected official in the United States Marine, was guided\nby resolute moral compass and an unyielding belief in the value of hard work and the power\nof education to change lives.\nFor those of us fortunate enough to have known him, Governor Miller had the heart of a line,\nAnd at the same time, the stubbornness of a mountain mule.\nBut in the mountains at Zell, and I call home, there are fewer traits, more praiseworthy,\nthan having the courage of your convictions, and having a good independent street to stick\nby them regardless.\nHe's the only individual, and probably the only individual who could have, he noted both\nthe Democratic and Republican National Conventions. And when I attended his funeral in 2018, along\nwith Dean Smiley, we saw him eulogized by three count of one, two, three former presidents\nof the United States from both political parties. In the last three or four years of his life,\nI made a point of visiting with him two or three times a year at his home.\nNot because he needed company, he had plenty of that, but because to be with him made\nme better, and I learned so much during those visits.\nIn the man from Young Harris, Georgia got a leader who stood above partisan politics and\nyet enjoyed as much as anybody, the give and take of the battle.\nAnd Zell Miller, Georgia, got a leader who looked down that dusty dirt road he often talked\nabout that ran through young Harris.\nAnd he saw that as a road to a brighter future for this state and particularly its children\nand a road that could take you all over the world.\nMadam Speaker, it is for these reasons and many more that I ask every member of this\nHouse to join with me in honoring a favorite son of our state, Governor and United States\nSenator, Zell Bryan Miller, and I ask for your favorable consideration on Senate Bill\n140. I know others want to speak to the measure and I yield the will.\nThe gentleman has yielded the well. The chair recognizes Representative Williams to speak\nto the bell.\nThank you Madam Speaker.\nThere are many in here that knew Governor Miller with the exception of probably the speaker\nbecause of his age.\nFew knew him longer than I did.\nI made him in 1972 on the floor of the Democratic National Convention when he was executive\ndirector of the party.\nThat was a volatile convention.\nThat was the very first convention that the governor did not pick delegates to the convention.\nAnd it was a tight rope to walk, the jail miller walked brilliantly.\nWe formed a friendship.\nA few years later he came and asked me to help him run for Lieutenant Governor, which\nI willingly did.\nThe pay was fantastic and occasional Coca-Cola in May, but Hamburg on a good day.\nBut he was, when he was elected, he did what had never been done before.\nHe made the Lieutenant Governor's office look like Georgia.\nI was the first African-American session aide to lieutenant governor in Georgia.\nIn that first session, I met a young guy who had a huge afro, a long car, and he walked\nin replaced Moses, I was Dean Smarrick, and then that group of us, he hired two African\nAmericans, administrative assistants, Elizabeth Martin, and Lillian Lewis, the widow of John\nLewis. He was a mountain populist, and I knew nothing about mountain populists until I got\nto know him. Yes, he was dubbing as a mule. But I was used as a sacrificial lamb a couple\nof times. When he was really hot and he and the speaker were a speaker murphy where\nat each at arms, he'd send me to take the message to the speaker. I think he knew I was the\nmost expendable person in the office.\nI'd go over, he'd give me this rip-raring message,\nnot written out, I had to repeat what he said and he'd say,\nyou tell him just like I said it.\nAnd I'd walk in and when I'd tell the speaker to speak\nand look at me and said, I know he didn't say it like that.\nAnd he'd said, see God of his mouth,\nbut you tell him just what I said when I got back.\nHe'd ask me what he said, not water it down.\nHe said, hell will you if you're a liar.\nBut he had a heart of gold, but he was a liar.\nIn his later years, many of you, particularly Democrats,\nwho remember only him speaking at the Republican National\nConvention in some of the candidates he supported.\nBut I remember the zeal miller that created an atmosphere that makes it possible in many\nways that this capital looks like it looks today.\nHe had a genuine love for people, and one of my most treasured items is the wedding gift\nhe gave to Olivia and I 43 years ago, this coming decently, but above all else.\nHe had one of the strongest wives I've ever known in my life, and that was Shirley Miller.\nNow you talk about a lady, she was strong.\nAnd because this state has always been like that, it didn't pay cost to law officers and\nespecially legislators, what they were worth, hand-hand.\nIt was a very low pay for Lieutenant Governor's.\nBut he was available.\ntime ever heard a country song was in his office and I didn't know what the\nworld that was he was playing and I said what is that he had a love for\ncountry music like you wouldn't believe I'm not going to ever forget him I know\nvery few people more deserving of a statue at this Capitol in Zell Brian Miller\nBut a giant of a man, or a dear friend, or my misforever, I urge you to vote yes to this\nresolution.\nThe fan, Madam Speaker, I yield the well.\nThe gentleman has yielded the well.\nThe chair recognizes Representative Smari to speak to the well.\nSpeak to the bell.\nHow you doing?\nThank you Madam Speaker, it's a pleasure for me to come today and speak on Senate Bill\n140, Zebra and Miller, and I want to say first that I talk with Shirley Miller maybe two\nor three times a year and his grandson, Brian, and have a relationship with the Miller's\nAnd one of the biggest honors I've ever received,\nI think you received it in 2018,\nthe Turtle on the Fence Pose award.\nAnd I received it in 2019,\nwith the Zell Miller Foundation.\nAnd I really got to know Zell Miller\nat the early, early time.\nI met him in 1975.\nIn fact, that gentleman right there, from the 168th district, set up the meeting.\nHe was a staffer at that time, Lieutenant Governor Miller.\nAnd I went to CM and we've had a relationship and a friendship since that time.\nAnd he's been said that he's been stubborn and we had a great, great relationship, Governor\nMiller.\nAnd sometimes we had some very, very spirited comments.\nHe was, that would be on the mile side.\nBut he is, in my opinion, one of the most consequential\ngovernors in the history of our state.\nAnd if you've never heard it, I think you ought to listen\nto his 1993 state of the state of dress.\nis one of the most courageous, timeless,\nand prophetic messages.\nI've listened to it maybe six or seven times.\nAnd in that speech, he talks about leadership.\nAnd he talks about the state in the fall of moving state.\nAnd he talked about, for the first time,\nchanging the Georgia state flag, which was very courageous.\nI could almost call him his election,\na one by 30-some thousand votes at that time.\nAnd after he won, he called us in one day\nand said, you know what?\nHe said, Georgia needs hope.\nAnd he came up with the Hope Scholarship Program.\nThat was not the first time I heard the word hope and lottery.\nGuy named John White, state representative down\nand all being a representative.\nWe just remember, talked us about a lottery.\nAnd, but Zeal talked about it.\nGov.\nAnd Moe talked about the lottery.\nAnd he said, what we ought to do is\ndesignated money for the future of our state,\nand invested in the intellectual capital\nof the young people in our state.\nWe keep our best and our brightest in our state.\nAnd so, Zell Miller, in his book written by Richard Hyatt,\nthe governor who gave Georgia hope,\nas one of the best reads I've read,\nand it talks about his entire life.\nAnd so I want to come this morning and say, in 1991,\nI remember I was on the committee.\nThat time, how you it was called\na University System of Georgia Committee.\nAnd I went on later to chair that committee.\nAfter Dubos Portal was, at that time,\none of his flow leaders, and he handled the legislation\nin hope, and I think Representative Joe Green\nrepresented Butch Parish, and represented Mary Margaret Oliver, and\nrepresentative Ellen Powell, I think, with the members that were here in\n19, in that time, I might have missed somebody I apologize, but\nthose are the ones I can remember that we're here when we passed, when we\nhad the committee, the bill in the committee, and the University System of\nGeorgia, and I went with ZL when he bought the first lottery ticket on\na great moment for the state of Georgia and the rest is history.\nSo, Mr. Speaker, I'm honored and delighted to come.\nAnd to give recognition to a giant of a man,\na man who gave a lot to this state,\na man who was historic in his governorship\nand remember going to the state senate,\ngoing to lieutenant governor for 16 years,\nyears going to governor for eight years and going to the U.S. Senate for six years.\nHe just was a tremendous governor and a tremendous person and I enjoyed it, rolled out together\nto his, you know, and having a conversation about Zell Miller.\nSo Mr. Speaker, this is very timely and very appropriate that we erect a statue in the\nhonor of a giant of a man, an individual who gave much for this state, and you've heard\nme say this a 100 times, you make your living by what you get, what you make your life\nby what you give, as the another made his life by giving, but that we all be very, very\nthankful.\nSo I'm asking everyone if you would please vote in favor of Senate Bill 140 so that we\ncan move on, get this done, and have the ceremony, and get this family over here, and salute\nto an individual that gave much of his state, and gave much to Georgia, and much to this\nnation.\nWith that, Madam Speaker, I will yield the well.\nThank you.\nThe gentleman has yielded the well.\nIs there any objection to the previous question being ordered?\nThe chair here is none.\nThe previous question is ordered.\nIs there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable\nto the passage of the bill?\nChair, here's
