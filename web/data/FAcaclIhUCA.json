That completes the order, Mr. President. I recognize the senator from the four speaks to the measure. Thank you, Mr. President. It is honored to be here today and this is the bill that we've been in the house working on real hard with the house. As you all know, we passed Senate bill 211 here a few weeks ago and I stated a few days ago, I think one of the key words coming out of this whole session for the House and Senate is literacy or more important ill literacy. So we weren't very close. We represented the way we represent Bauer, Representative Evans and the governor's office on this on on 538 House Bill 538 and also Senate bill 211. Now I'm very proud of our work and the sending efforts around literacy decision and we appreciate the bipartisan efforts and collaboration with the governor's office and the House. Today the House is taking up Senate bill 211 which we passed unanimously from this body. It forms the Georgia literacy council. This bill, 538 compliments Senate bill 211, working in partnership with their efforts. I'll bring before you the House bill 538 called the Georgia Early Literacy Act. This bill does, it defines educational literacy skills, high quality instruction manuals and the science reading as the evidence based practice is required for our students. This legislation also sets up the safety framework for implementation for the Department of Early Care and Learning, State Board of Education, Department of Education Professional Standards Commission and our local school systems. Section 2 in the bill refers to the decal requirements for implement an evidence based for the federal development for early learning required by teachers by July 1, 2025 and this bill has the civic dates in it. Starting on line 92, brief overview of the framework, State Board with Department of Education and Ghosts is a uniform, great appropriate metrics for measuring literacy. State Board will approve high quality instruction materials. State Board and Department will approve universal reading screeners to be used by schools by July 1, 2024. Department of Education working with the University of Assistant Georgia and the Professional Standards Commission will approve professional development programs for K-3-3 teachers. State Board will also provide technical assistance in implement training. If you will see on line 159, local board of education beginning of the 24 were used high quality instruction materials for K-3-3. You see this bill has a lot to do with K-3-3. Line 199 shall implement for public school system, tiered reading intervention plans for students K-3. Beginning July 1, 2025, Georgia assessment for certification of teachers or any other assessment required by professional standards commission shall be aligned with developmental approved evidence based literacy instruction. As you can tell, this legislation provides for the implementation of important evidence based practices and I appreciate how our Senate bill 211 set us up the Georgia Literacy Council to oversee and ensure that these policies are working. The Council will also make important recommendations for investments and funding needed to sustain these efforts. I am confident we are moving in a right duration needed so that all of our children will learn how to read. I'm happy to miss president. I'm happy to answer any questions. You do have some questions, Senator. Senator from the 42nd. Thank you, Mr. President. Will the Senate yield? Yes, ma'am. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, you may have mentioned this and if you did, I missed it so I apologize. Can you give me an update on the status of SB211 in the other chamber? Yes, ma'am. I understand SB211. Rips and Bellers in the back, I'll be here now and it should give me a nod. It has been passed in the house, correct? Yes, ma'am. Up today, she said. Up today is so bad. We certainly look forward to the house passing SB211. Don't we, Mr. Chairman? Yes, we sure do. Thank you, ma'am. Thank you for your work and thank you to the representative. Thank you so much, ma'am. You have no question, Senator. Thank you. Mr. President, I yield a will. We have a late coming amendment here. Secretary Reed, the caption.

The Code Section 20-2-206 provided, however, that the Commission's standards and procedures consider for in-state certification nationally accredited teacher certification programs outside of this state, which are state-sponsored and meet the academic accreditation and certification requirements of the Commission and that completes the order, Mr. President. We're going to add a sooner from 31st to speak to the amendment. Thank you, Mr. President, and apologize for the last minute amendment. Basically, what this amendment does is simply requires consideration of any nationally accredited educator prep program in this state. It meets the Georgia Academic Operations Standards established by the PSC.

The committee of the Senate on appropriations recommends that this bill do pass by substitute, respectfully submitted, Senator Tillery of the 18th District Chairman. The Senate committee of appropriations offers the following substitute to House Bill 611. A bill to be entitled an act to amend part one of Article 4 of Chapter 12 of Title 45 of the official code of Georgia annotated. Relating to management of budgetary and financial affairs, so as to provide for the disposition of all funds paid to the state from legal settlements. To provide for limited matters, to provide for an effective date, to repeal conflicting laws. That completes the order, Mr. President. We're going to ask Senator from the 17th to speak to the measure. Thank you, Mr. President. Understand how you got me mixed up with the Senate from the 19th. This bill came from an appropriations committee, but it's actually a judiciary bill. I think it was sent to appropriations because the Senate from the 19th no longer serves on the judiciary committee. I wanted to get a couple legal bills in his committee this year. But all this bill is doing is it's being consistent in saying that any funds that are obtained by our state, through any legal settlements will all flow through this body, through the process and go through our budgeting process. Of course, subject to any terms of any orders or agreements that are made, but just make sure that money actually flows through us as a buy that designates funds. But that happens to me questions. Do you have a question, Senator? Senator from the 13th. Sir, do you? Yes, sir. Could you tell us why the Senate from the 19th is not on judiciary anymore? I'd rather not get into that from everybody, but thank you. Thank you. You have no more questions, Senator. Ask for your favorable consideration of House Bill 611. Does any other Senator wish to speak for against the measure? Chair, here's none. Is there objection for the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none the previous question is ordered. Questions on the adoption of the committee substitute? Is there objection to the adoption of the committee substitute? Hearing none the committee substitute is adopted. Is there objection to agreed to afford a committee, which is favourable to the passers of the bill? Chair, here's none the\u02b2 the Committee is agreed to. Is there objection to the male question being ordered? Chair, here's none the maintaining and question is ordered. Questions on the passes of the bill? MSF suit, all those who takes out their flag? you I On the pass of the bill the Yez are 51 the nays are one this bill having received the rest of the constitutes majorities therefore passed by substitute You All right we're gonna stay in a recess for about 30 minutes We're waiting on a few things that happened over across the hallway with our friends. So we're just going to stand and recess for about 30 minutes. And the senator from the eight says he's got some peach cobbler or something back there for you. So, all right. Stay at Stanities. Thank you. You You You You You",
