  "transcript": "Morning everybody.\n>> Morning Dean Green. Good to see you.\n>> Thank you.\n>> Good morning everybody.\n>> If you will please take your seats and\nwe'll call the meeting to order and\nwe'll begin. Uh we're going to ask\nChairman Limson to open us up with a\nword of prayer this morning. Thank you.\nShould be on. Try it. Try it now.\nTry the one next to you.\n>> Yeah. Hold on. We get the wireless to\nover there.\nLittle technical difficulty here.\nYeah,\nthat's your button again there.\n>> Try it again.\nNo,\n>> try that one. Okay.\n>> All right. If you would bow with me,\nplease. Our heavenly father, we thank\nyou for this day. We thank you for your\nlove and your goodness to us and for\nwatching over us and caring for us. We\nthank you for the opportunity that you\nhave given to each of us to be here\ntoday. We just pray that you would bless\nour time together. Uh we thank you for\nthe uh position that you've placed each\nof us in. We just ask for your guidance\nand your wisdom as we uh look at doing\nthe things that uh come before us today\nto hopefully do good things for the\npeople of the state of Georgia. We just\npray that what we do would be pleasing\nin your sight and ask for your guidance\nand direction. We pray it in Jesus name\nand for his sake. Amen.\n>> Amen.\n>> Amen. Thank you, sir. Sorry about the\ntechnical difficulties there.\nOkay, let's go ahead and begin. Replace.\nThank you, chairman.\nI come before you with Georgia House\nResolution 1177.\nIt's a bipartisan resolution about\nsaving lives because when 84% of\npedestrians death happen at night,\nvisibility becomes a matter of life and\ndeath. That single fact tells us that\nthis resolution matters. Across Georgia,\npedestrians fatalities are rising at an\nalarming and an unacceptable rate. In\n2024 alone, 294\npedestrians were killed and the vast\nmajority of them were at night.\nThese are not just isolated incidents.\nThey are a clear pattern demanding\naction and house resolution 1177\nresponse to the crisis with common sense\ndatadriven approach focused on a\ncritical factor visibility.\nSo when drivers cannot see, lives are\nchallenged. Thank you.\n>> Okay. Thank you, ma'am. We don't don't\nsee any questions. Thank you. My\nsenator, Senator Burns.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning,\ncommittee. I have before you today\nSenate Bill 74. Senate Bill 74 protects\nGeorgia's children from being provided\naccess to harmful materials in\nlibraries. It repeals an exemption for\nlibraries and librarians from the\nprovisions of OCGA1612103,\nwhich is our obscinity laws, but it has\ncertain protections. I want to thank the\nuh Judiciary Non-Ivil Committee for\nworking with me on this bill. I want to\nthank the West Georgia Regional Library\nSystem for uh offering some friendly\namendments that we adopted and I\nappreciate the consideration for SB74.\n>> Okay, got a couple of questions for you.\nequip part.\n>> Um I don't know what's going on over\nhere. Just use that wireless. Try try\nthat.\n>> Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n>> Senator Burns, um why are you trying to\nWhy are you trying to criminalize\nlibrarians? You know, I I received the\nemails, you know, saying or implying\nthat libraries were these\nobscene material. Can you help me\nunderstand or demonstrate proof in which\nlibraries are have all these seen\nmaterials that would warrant the\ncriminal library in Georgia. Uh thank\nyou for the question. First of all, this\nbill in no way criminalizes librarians\nor libraries. This let me explain what\nit does not do. It does not change\nlongestablished Georgia statutes as it\nrelates to obscinity laws in Georgia go\nback to 1969.\nIt does not ban any book. No book is\nbanned. Number three, it does not\ncriminalize librarians. It does require\nthem to reatalog and place those books\nin the appropriate areas. I'm happy to\nprovide you with examples, and your\ncolleagues are happy to provide you with\nexamples of materials in Georgia\nlibraries in children's sections that\nare inappropriate.\n>> One more follow-up question.\nWould it not be more appropriate if\nyou're concerned with obscenity to ban\nthe internet from children with respect\nto their access as criminalizing\nlibrarians, which this bill does do?\nUh, I I appreciate your comments and I\nacknowledge the fact that the internet\nprovides access that is virtually\nunfettered, although we do have filters\nin libraries and schools to protect our\nchildren. I want to reiterate this does\nnot criminalize anything. It simply\nrequires all Georgians to follow\nlongestablished Georgia law. So you sir\nmust follow this law. I must follow this\nlaw. It does in no way criminalize\nanyone.\nChairman Hawkins.\n>> Okay. Took care of that. He waved. Uh\nRepresentative Miller,\ntry your mic. See if it works by chance.\nNo. She's a\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Um, just on\nyour point of of not criminalizing, just\njust so I'm clear, there's no provision\nin this bill that allows for the arrest\nof a librarian as it relates to\n>> there are certain provisions in the\nlegislation that gives protections to\nthe librarians. It's been there for a\nlong time. What this bill does is remove\nthe exception and places the\nresponsibility on the governing\nauthority of that library or that\nschool. The only way that a librarian\nwill be held accountable is if they fail\nto comply with their local board's uh\ndecisions on the materials. Again, the\nmaterials themselves are not removed.\nThey are reataloged and placed in\nappropriate sections for adults.\n>> Okay? And just so I understand the the\nremoval of immunity, the immunity was\nfrom criminal prosecution. Correct.\n>> That is correct.\n>> So if we are removing immunity from crim\nuh removing immunity from criminal\nprosecution, how is that not\ncriminalizing librarians?\n>> There's no difference between a\nlibrarian in a middle school and a\nseventh grade teacher in a middle\nschool. the middle school teacher is not\nafforded any protections from uh\nproviding harm from the children minors.\nWhat this does is place the school\nlibrarian in the exact same posture. You\nmadam are\n>> represent\n>> respons I'm sorry representative forgive\nme uh you representative are\nunder this statute as I am and so we're\nnot criminalizing anyone. We're trying\nto protect children. One followup. There\nwas a rationale for providing librarians\nthis this carveout. Is is that not true?\n>> Uh you're welcome to share with me that\nrationale. I failed to understand why it\nwas ever put in statute. Well, I I guess\nwhat I'm what I'm trying to make sure\nI'm clear on is if if you know that\nthere was immunity provided to\nlibrarians who do hold a special place\nin our society and in our community, um\nif we are stripping that immunity away,\nhave you not thought through why they\nhad it in the first place? We had that\ndiscussion extensively in committee\nand there was a great deal of input from\nboth libraries and librarians as well as\np the public. I think I spent five\nsessions in uh house judiciary non-civil\ndebating and discussing this issue.\nWhere we landed where where we finally\nagreed to on the language that you see\nin front of you now is based on a\nrecommendation\nfrom the director of the West Georgia\nRegional Library System. and we're\ntrying to protect children but also\nprovide librarians the flexibility to do\ntheir job professionally and we're\ngrateful for that.\n>> Thank you. I I think we can protect the\nthe the intent of your bill is certainly\nadmirable but um removing immunity does\nnot seem to be necessary uh for us to do\nthat. We we don't need to incentivize\nprosecution of librarians when we are\nobviously overrun uh in our society and\nour communities by violent crime and\nother criminals who deserve to be\nprosecuted. So um I'm I'm sorry I can't\nsupport this bill.\n>> Thank you for your\n>> waves. Okay. Don't see any other\nquestions.\nChairman Thomas.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm here to\npresent House Bill 1063. It's on page\ntwo, the bottom of the blue sheet.\nHouse Bill 1063 protects residential and\nretail electricity customers from costs\nassoc associated with data center\nconstruction and operation. Uh it does\nso at the very high level. It requires\nelectric utility contracts with data\ncenters to include terms protecting\nresidential and retail customers from\ncosts related to data center\nconstruction and operation. It mandates\nminimum billing requirements and\ncontracts to recover incremental costs\nof serving or preparing to serve data\ncenters. It allows contract terms to\nexceed the length of the standard\nutility service tariffs. It requires\nperformance and credit provisions and\ncontracts to protect retail customers of\ndata center defaults on the contract. It\nmandates termination provisions to\nprotect retail customers if electric\nservice contracts with data centers are\nended. Uh it applies the new\nrequirements only to contracts entered\nonto or after the effective date of the\nact and it grants the Georgia Public\nService Commission authority to\ndetermine compliance with these\nrequirements. That's the uh high level\noverview.\n>> Okay. Any questions?\n>> Don't see any questions. Thank you, sir.\n>> Thank you.\nrecognize Speaker Pro Tim.\n>> Thank Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I've got\na um rule substitute to House Bill 907\nthat I would request that the committee\nconsider it. Makes a\na very minor but meaningful change on\nin section two. Um the language needed\nmodifying um to make sure that an\nexisting completion school could offer\nservices in a region that does not\ncurrently have a completion school\navailable to students at risk for\ndropping out. There's one in particular\nthat wants to offer these services. It's\nFoothills which is based in the Athens\nregion and they want to offer services\nto Rockdale and the way the language was\nwritten earlier um they had to already\nbe offering those services. They do not\ncurrently offer those services and want\nto and I'd ask for the uh committee's\nfavor consideration.\n>> Okay, that's the committee sub. You\nshould have a copy. is LC 492636s.\nHave\na motion. Any discussion? Any questions?\nOkay. Have a motion to accept the\nsubstitute.\nMove.\n>> Move and second. Any opposition?\nSo ordered. Okay.\nUm,\nwe recognize\nSecretary Kelly for a motion.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would move\nthat House Bill 1066 be recommitted to\nthe Governmental Affairs Committee.\n>> Okay, we have a motion and a second. Any\nopposition is back in governmental\naffairs.\nOkay.\nOkay, let's set us a calendar for\ntomorrow, Wednesday,\nday 17,\nunder modified structure,\nHouse Bill 57.\nHave a move.
