He's also did entertainment. I am here to say to you that he currently serves\non the National Advisory Board of the NIH, that's the National Institutes of Health. He's\nalso on the Community Advisory Board of the Morehouse College School of Medicine. Now,\nI ask you to welcome me.\nWell, help me welcome Chaplin, Leland Jones.\nThe morning, sir, pleasure's mind, sir.\nThank you for the introduction.\nThank you for allowing me to feel welcome in this space.\nAnd now for a moment that matters more importantly\nthan anything else.\nWho I am is very minor, but what I have to say, we pray, makes a major difference.\nIf there is a scripture that reads to this particular moment, it simply would be 1 Samuel,\nchapter number 30, verse 6, where it says, and David was greatly distressed for the people\nspeak of stoning him because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons\nand for his daughters.\nBut David encouraged himself in the Lord his God.\nMaster, give me guidance.\nSo if there were words for consideration,\nit would simply be encourage yourself.\nLooking at this particular story,\nwe find where David is now being hunted by Saul.\nSaul has gotten to the point where his spirit has changed.\nAnd David, who was a Psalmist, for Saul is now turned.\nDavid was raised with Saul's son Jonathan.\nThey're like brothers, you know.\nBut when someone's heart turns against you,\nsometimes you've simply got to go.\nHere we find where Saul and his troops\nare not only dealing with trying to hunt down David,\nbut they are also battling of the forces.\nDavid knowing this.\nHas now had the reality of his life knowing\nthat I'm the one who beheaded Goliath and the Philistines\nrespect him, but guess what?\nIn this particular text, David to protect himself\nhas aligned himself with the Philistines.\nMan by the name of Akish is the king,\nand they join with other Philistines\nto get ready to go to battle against the Israelites.\nThe other Philistines said, he might work with you,\nbut he's not going to work with us.\nAnd so David and those few warriors that were with him\nhad to go back home and when they went back home\nthey found that where they lived was the land of Ziglaq.\nThe problem was in the south that the Amalakites had come\nand had burned their camp, burned their small city,\ntook their children and their wives.\nAt that moment when they returned they were crestfallen,\nthey were hurting and here we find\nwhere David has men who he served with\nwho are ready to stone him\nbecause they've lost everything.\nMy friends, there would be moments in your place\nwhere you might have to stand alone.\nAnd David in our text did one thing.\nHe encouraged himself in the Lord.\nThat being said, let's look at just three points\nand then yes, I am through.\nThe first thing is, in difficult times,\nyou might have to align yourself with strange partners\nthat when the common ground has been found,\ninvest in working together.\nOh my goodness, I hope you can see the power\nand the wealth that comes when you get on common ground.\nBut ultimately, David worked with those\nwho actually feared him with the Philistines.\nOh, please align yourself, but whatever you do,\ndo not abandon your purpose.\nSo my first point is partnership.\nPartnership does matter.\nThe second thing that matters is also perseverance,\nbecause even when we find ourselves in difficult situations,\ndon't allow temporary challenges\nto become permanent impediments.\nYes, distress will come.\nYes, the storms will blow.\nYes, frustrations will occur.\nBut whatever you do, do not give up.\nBecause we as a state need you to stay focused on your path.\nYou've been elected for that particular understanding,\nperseverance.\nThe last thing is, also with perseverance to dovetail is press on.\nGuess what?\nWe need each of you to lead.\nWe need each of you to not only reach the point to where you're serving your constituents,\nbut we need you to make a difference for those of us who serve in different capacities.\nWe all have our challenges.\nAnd so I simply say, every once in a while, like David,\nyou're going to feel like no one cares.\ngoing to feel like no one understands, but you're going to have to encourage yourself.\nThe suicide rates show us that people are sometimes disaffected by life.\nAnd that's a reality we have to face.\nI'm saying encourage yourself.\nSometimes when people get an argument over little things, it might be just little.\nYou don't have to get to the point to where you go to blows.\nWhy do we bring out guns whenever someone steps on my blue suede shoes?\nEncourage yourself.\nI want you to know, my friends, very simply this.\nour state needs you. Encourage yourself. Our cities need you. Encourage yourself. Every citizen\nof Georgia is depending upon you here today and throughout the session to make job producing,\nfood providing, relationships, strengthening, and forward-thinking choices. And even the rest\nof the globe is saying, what is Georgia going to do today? Your constituents are seeking your\nsupport. Your counterparts are seeking your collaboration. And even if I tell you nothing else,\nEncourage yourself, but you don't have much time.\nBenjamin Elijah Mays made it clear.\nI have only just a minute, only 60 seconds in it.\nForced upon me, can't refuse it, didn't sick he didn't choose it,\nbut it's up to me to use it.\nI must suffer if I lose it, give account if I abuse it.\nJust a tiny little minute, but it turn it tears in it.\nI am a soldier.\nI need to you to encourage yourself.\nI need you to work the difference.\nI need you to walk the aisles.\nI need you to kiss the babies.\nI need you to make the difference, encourage yourself, and lead us in the right direction.\nAnd while you are standing, let us pray.\nWe ask God that you simply take these kind moments and these opportunities to be able\nto share, to be able to say to these who have an authorized power of office, to look around\nand to know that we are counting upon them, we support the decisions they make.\nAnd for many of us in uniform, the fact needs to constantly be with us every time we put\non the uniform that we might have to shed the blood because of decisions made in this place.\nWe are looking to them to make the right choices and at the same time, I'm asking that you\nprotect them, but also, oh God, bless and protect our military, our families, those of us\nwho are here, sworn to support and to defend.\nWe leave ourselves with you, oh God, let it be for the better, amen.\npledge of allegiance.\nI pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for\nwhich it stands.\nOne nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all, also.\nOkay, y'all, the paperwork is ready in any room.\nIf you haven't been a member of the military, you can join now.\nIf you've been a member, you can re-up now, that's what I'm going to do.\nDoorkypers, please unlock the doors.\nMembers may greet the chaplain of the day in the south any room for photos and degree\ndetail.

It's a tremendous National Guard, our\nleadership works hard to serve you and our Guard is proud to serve you as our\nrepresentatives. We are glad to have you as our representatives in the House.\nWe want to thank you for your support, your continued support, especially a lot\nof the armory renovations that are ongoing throughout the state of Georgia.\nWe have representatives from our Army National Guard in every single community within the\nstate, and you are representing 100 percent of us, I can honestly say that.\nSo thank you for that, thank you for your continued support, and one last thing I do want\nto say is we're hiring.\nWe've got vacancies, and we're looking forward to you helping us recruit.\nAnd by the way, we need to go over to the leadership group that's over here and pass\nout some R&R signs, because that's another thing we can thank you for, because you support\nall of our students who come into the guard with a student loan repayment program, and\nThat is a tremendous opportunity for young people in every community within every inch of\nour state to go and get a higher education and graduate debt-free.\nAnd because of your support, our youth have that opportunity.\nSo again, thank you, thank you, Mr. Speaker, Chairman Bonner, Mr. Representative Bonner,\nin the entire house.\nThank you.\nSo, General Gentry, on behalf of the entire House of Representatives, we'd like to present\nyou with this resolution, establishing January 6th, as George and National Guard day here\nat the Capitol.\nThank you, General.\nI know all of us know how important the National Guard has been in the history of the United\nStates of America.\nAnd there work here in Georgia and around this world is your service to protect our lives\nhere, is most appreciated, and certainly we're so very humbled and pleased to work with\nthe National Guard, and that will continue.\nThank you all so much for being here today.\nMembers, thank you for your attention to these folks\nwho are dedicated to our safety and our protection.\nSo thank you all for that.\nWe're ready to go move on to afternoon orders.\nWe'll start with Representative Bentley for an afternoon order, Representative Patty Bentley.\nWith the later yield for just for a minute, members, let me have your attention just for\na moment.

You'd be having a lot of conversations that certain\nSubjects are breached and talked about here in the well.\nSo I would ask you if you need to have an important conversation,\nplease take it to the any room.\nBecause we need to pay attention to the member,\nthey would not be here if it were not imported.\nSo I would appreciate your cooperation on that.\nThat's important for all of us.\nIt's important for the integrity of this house.\nSo let's remember that as we do our afternoon orders today\nand in the future.\nThank you so much.\nRepresentative Bentley.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nColleagues, if you would please stay in.\nI come to you this afternoon, I ask that you focus your attention to the screens.\nI come this afternoon to offer our condolences to the families of Martavian time man of\nMacon County, Georgia and Jacob Jake Pounds of Taylor County, Georgia.\nTime man of Macon County passed away at the age of 30 and will be late to rest on this Saturday\nafternoon.\nTy was a 2010 graduate of making county high school and he was a son of Earl man senior\nand Reverend Anthony and first lady tapeth the man.\nJacob Jake Pounds passed away last week at the age of 23.\nJake was pursuing a degree in animal science from A-Bat College.\nJake was the beloved son of Russell and Michelle Pounds of Taylor County, Georgia.\nWe want the families of Ty Mann and Jake Pounds to know that the entire House of Representatives\nare praying with you and praying for you.
