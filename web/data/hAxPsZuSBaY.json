  "transcript": "Okay, we're running a little early. I\nhope I've got all my committee members\nhere, but uh I'd like to call the order\nof the public safety subcommittee on\nappropriations. And we're going to start\noff with uh Department of Community\nSupervision.\nUh 18.2.3,\nwe're going to reduce funds for personal\nservices. And you'll see this time and\ntime again in this uh in in uh this\npresentation. And all this is is last\nyear we had some new positions. When\nthey're not filled on July 1st, very\nobviously we're not going to have a\nsalary for the whole year. So whatever\nmonths it takes for them to get hired,\nwe take that money back. So we're going\nto recover\nuh $100,000\nin in that item. Moving on to the\nDepartment of Corrections\nunder food and farm operations. The\nDepartment of Corrections runs their own\nfarm down in Reedsville. They they\nprovide almost exclusively all the food\nfor 50,000 inmates in our penal system.\nUnder 19.3.4 provide funds for food\nservices across state facilities\ncontracted with Georgia Correctional\nIndustries due to rising food costs. Uh\nthere was nothing budgeted. We put in\n2,445,000.\nThat's one half of the request. They\nlost 4.8 8 million in fiscal year 25.\n19.3.5\nprovide funds for the purchase of meat\nduring processing equipment upgrades.\nTheir meat processor quit last year.\nThey had to buy uh meat patties outside\nwhile it was under renovation. That was\na million79,000.\n19.3.6\nprovide funds for food and farm\nequipment and software upgrades. they\ncan't grow the they can't grow the food\nto raise the livestock without the\nequipment. And for about the last four\nyears, we tried to upgrade and and uh we\nhaven't been able to fund it. So we put\nin a million $15,000 this year by a\npotato planter, two road planters, uh\nsome hog traps, combine, nitrogen\napplicator so that they can they can do\nthe job and and feed our inmates. Under\n19.4.3 4.3\nincrease funds for the physical health\ncontract for a PDM increase of\n10,946,000\n108.\nWe would we we're going to be able to\ntake back 16,72\nbecause we're paying them to from March\nwhen it was appropriated through July.\n19.4.7\nincrease funds for residential substance\nabuse treatment centers effective April\n1st. Uh there was nothing funded. We put\n$312,000\n500.\nThat's one quarter of the request.\nCounselor salaries are 20% lower than\nthe state average and and they have\ndifficulty hiring people. This a\nrecommendation for Gateway which is is a\nconsulting company that Department of\nCorrections hired to assist them uh in\nsome of their endeavors.\nMoving down to offender management 19.5\nprovide funds for rural local county\njail reimbursement where more than 20%\nof jail capacity utilization is occupied\nby detainees unable to make bail on\ncontraband or drone related charges.\nThey now have the capability to track\nthese drones when they come in. So they\ntrack them and they call the local\nsheriff's department. They run them\ndown, arrest them, and they put them in\ntheir local jails. And some of them sit\nthere for a while and they don't have in\nin some of these small counties, they\ndon't have the ability to provide the\nthe food and substance that's required\nto maintain them. So uh we're going to\nput in a,500,000\nto fund them for 30 the first 30 days\nthat they're in in the jail.\nMoving on to\n19.7.3\nincrease funds for additional correction\nofficer positions, approved staff to\noffender ratios.\nUh they put in $4 million. We upped it\nto 9 million. The projection between\nhiring promotion. There's a six-mon step\nand overtime cost. The actual need is 7\n19.7 to fully fund.\n19.7.5\nprovide funds for a pilot program at\nAltry State Prison to provide peer-led\nprogramming. This is came out of a a\ngroup that went to Texas and observed\nit, but uh we've got a lot of new\nprograms and we didn't get enough\ninformation, so we we didn't fund that.\n19.7.12\nincrease funds for operations at Lee\nArendale State Prison. They're shutting\ndown the prison. They were going to\nleave uh 200 inmates there uh because\nthey've got a uh packaging program\nwarehouse there for the GCI kitchen and\nmaintenance. So, what we're going to do\nis leave 200 more there so we don't have\nto pay for maintenance in the facility.\nWe'll have 200 uh additional inmates to\ndo the maintenance and upkeep and work\nin the kitchen. That's 3,879,000.\n19.7.13\nincreased funds for rent at Arnell North\nBasic Correctional Officer Training\nBuilding. Uh it was funded at $14,000\nfor the rent. That'll cover one month.\nWe put in $219,236\nto carry us through the year.\nMoving on to 19.7.14\nincreased funds for offender call\nmonitoring contract due to an increase\nin usage. We have two court cases that\nhave affected us this year. One it one\nis that u\nuh they uh\nthey can call anybody they want. the uh\nthe courts have said that they used to\nbe limited to their visitor list which\nis typically family. Now the courts have\nsaid they can call anybody they want. So\nwe we believe there's going to be a lot\nmore calls. And the other thing is the\ncourts have said that we can't charge\nthem. We used to charge them a little\nbit of money for their phone calls and\ndeduct it from their accounts. They said\nwe can't do that anymore. So we have to\npick up that. It's total comes to\n$764,000.\n9.7.15\nincrease funds or excuse me I was wrong\none 19.7.16\nincrease fund for contracted food\nservices due to rising food and labor\ncosts\nit wasn't anything budgeted we put\n284,000 in there funds one quarter\nrequest by error mark for the increase\nas for the last four years cost for\nlabor and foods up 8.4% 4%\n19.7.17\nincrease fund for central repair funds\nfor capital projects. There wasn't\nanything in the budget. We put $725,992\nin there. This uh replaces funds for the\nemergency repairs. They made the meat\nfacility repairs. They had to use money\nout of the central pair to do that. So,\nwe're going to replace that money.\nDefense Department. We had no changes.\nGovernor's office. uh the Georgia\nemergency management uh\nuh organization comes on under the\ngovernor's office and uh\nwe uh we're going to give them a half\nmillion dollars for one-time funds for\nlocal emergency management agencies for\nwhat they had to utilize during\nHurricane Ken that uh they're not\ngetting any federal or state money for.\nGeorgia Bureau of Investigation\nuh regional investigative offices 30.4\n4.4 reduce funds for personal services\nbe best on actual start dates. U this is\nanother true up we're going to take back\n203,000\nuh 30.4.5 eliminate funds for onetime\nconnectivity to the statewide gain\ndatabase management system. The budget\nsaid we were going to take back\n$800,000.\nThey say they really have to have that.\nSo we zeroed it out and going to give\nthem that million dollars they asked\nfor.\nUnder Criminal Justice Coordinating\nCouncil 30.5.4\nutilize existing funds. Uh we had a\nsavings of $133,000 on rent and we're\ngoing to add 301,000 to it so that uh we\nmake we'll be able to fund their grant\nsystem and make it compatible with\nGeorgia at work.\nUh 30.5.6 provide funds for eight child\nadvocacy centers and 19 satellites\noffice locations that meet minimum\nstandards. Provides specialized services\nnot currently state funded. Nothing in\nthe budget. We added 185,000.\nCriminal Justice Coordinating Council\nFamily Violence Center 30.7.2 two\nprovide onetime funds to domestic\nviolence shelters and sexual assault\ncenters for operational and facility\nneeds.\nThese things have been funded for many\nyears through federal grants and the\nfederal grants have pretty much been cut\noff. So we put 424,525,000\nthere. That funds 47 domestic violence\nshelters, 34 sexual assault centers at\n$50,000 each and 19 sexual satellite\nsexual assault centers at $25,000 each.\nJuvenile Justice Department of Juvenile\nJustice has no changes. The law\ndepartment 33.1.3 reduced funds for\npersonal services based on the actual\nstart date of new positions. This is a\ntrue up uh meant to recover 93,000. We\nonly recovered 43,000 because we had to\ngive them $50,000 for they didn't think\nthey needed to represent the JQC in a\ncase and they it was determined that\nthey did and it was $50,000 so we\nreimbured that.\nPardons of we have none. Department of\nPublic Safety uh the actual department\nof public safety we don't have anything.\nSome of the satellite\nadmin that are attached to them for\nadministrative purposes. the Georgia\nFirefighters Standards of Training\nCouncil.\nUh\n39.8.3\nincrease fund for startup cost for one\nsafety and compliance specialist. This\nis just the startup cost. We put in\n$60,000.\nUh they're going to they're going to add\none person in Atlanta, which means this\nis the last we've been doing this for a\ncouple years. This is the last one\nthat'll give us statewide coverage now\nwhen we hire him next year to uh to\ndrive the car. Uh\nBut uh this means that uh they'll be\nable to inspect every fire station in\nthe state every year, which is something\nrelatively",
