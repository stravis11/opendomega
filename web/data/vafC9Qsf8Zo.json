  "transcript": "music\na beautiful way to start the legislative session in the house with the reigning Miss Georgia,\nAudrey Cattilla, serenading house members with her voice and her violin. Good evening and\nWelcome to Lawmakers.\nI'm Donna Lowry in Atlanta.\nIt's the 158th session of the Georgia General Assembly and the 56th season of Lawmakers.\nIt's a campaign year and several lawmakers are running for higher office during the session.\nA few have departed to either focus on their campaigns and there are other reasons why\nthey've left.\nThat means there are some new faces under the Gold Dome.\nFor the next 40 days, expect bills in the areas of education, property, and state income\ntaxes, and artificial intelligence.\nPlus a major focus on affordability, looking for budget-friendly housing and health care\nlegislation.\nBut before getting in all that, let's find out what happened today from our own capital\ncorrespondence, Sarah Callis, who happens to be here for a change and not all the way\nat the dome, where I don't have to yell at you to get there.\nSo thanks for being here on set.\nthank you for having me always great to be we're we're happy to get into this\nsession our first day of lawmakers and it's somewhat busy there a lot of\nprocedural things yeah it was great to be back at the Capitol with the lawmakers\ncrew and today lawmakers got to work very quickly in a newly renovated house\nand senate chambers under the gold dome it's the first day of the past\nsession and as expected both floors gabbled out after accomplishing\nprocedural business. They welcomed new members in both chambers.\nLet's give our new Senator from Cobb County, Senator Howard from the 35th here. Let's give\nhim a big round of applause. And the Senate unanimously selected\nSenator Larry Walker III as the new president pro tempore.\nMy father taught me that, you know, while we sit on different sides of the aisle or come\nfrom different areas of the state or different perspectives were all bound by a common duty\nto leave Georgia better than we found it. He understood that leadership isn't about\nthe title you hold, but the people you serve. And as I take this guy while I hope to honor\nhis legacy by bringing the same spirit of steady, principal leadership to this role.\nWalker replaces Senator John F. Kennedy, who resigned his seat last year to run for\nLieutenant Governor in this year's election.\nIn the House, lawmakers debated the 2026 legislative calendar.\nThe issue is actually Friday, March 20th, which is the end of Ramadan, and usually there's\nlike prayers people travel, see family, and we do have staff that could be impacted.\nIs there any way that we could potentially shift the committee work day that week and\nthen just switch them out essentially?\nAs I understand it, religious holidays, such as this holiday that you've referenced,\nmay be over several days.\nWhat I would just say is that holidays that are celebrated maybe at different times of\nthe day, that that understanding and accommodation can be made certainly, so that if there's an evening\ntime celebration or something like that, we may not be in session.\nBut I would just say that this schedule has been very carefully vetted.\nIn the end, both chambers approved the full schedule as presented for the legislative\nsession.\nHouse members also paid tribute to Representative Mandy Ballinger, who passed away last year\nafter a battle with cancer.\nWhat a great member of this house, what a great advocate for children in this state, for\nthose great advocate for those who suffer from domestic abuse.\nNot only in this house, but in the South Eastern United States and in America.\nAnd they enjoyed a special performance from Miss Georgia.\nMeanwhile, people flocked to the Capitol for the ACLU\npack the Capitol event, advocating for communication\nbetween legislators and their constituents.\nTo our elected officials, we are here to engage,\nnot to disrupt.\nWe are here to educate, not intimidate.\nWe are here to work with you, like democracy should.\nLast week, we got a preview of some of the legislative\npriorities to expect this session.\nWhen Republican Speaker of the House, John Burns spoke with reporters.\nWhether it be health care, whether it be property taxes, whether it be income taxes, all\nthe things that impact our lives.\nSo what we want to make sure of, that when we address affordability issues in so many\nand a wide variety of instances across the board, that we want Georgians to keep their\ndollars.\nAnd lawmakers teamed up with agricultural and civic leaders to support area food banks,\neat some barbecue and talk with reporters at the annual wild hog supper last night.\nThey also welcome new legislators, including the youngest lawmaker under the gold dome.\nI feel very proud of what I represent and what I stand for.\nI especially want to come to the youth.\nI mean, we're seeing this wave incoming of just pressure blood, pressure ideas.\nIt's not so much of a matter of age with me in particular.\nWhen it comes to politics, it's more of a drive and energy.\nAnd you see this with the newer wave that we want to get things done on the foundational\nlevel.\nPractical level, I want to make sure folks know what's going on.\nSo when we talk about words, like affordability, what does it look like behind the scenes?\nWhat's the process to make sure things actually get done?\nWhen we have issues with home prices, when it comes to corporate landlords, when it comes\nto private equity distorting things or algorithms artificially inflating rents and food prices,\nWe want to go through the process to make things better here in Georgia.\nAnd another interesting aspect of this session is the number of new lawmakers who are running\nfor higher office while still serving in the legislature.\nThat's my Capitol report.\nAnd we're going to talk about that right now with you, because you're staying with us.\nIt's so wonderful to have you here.\nAnd with veteran reporter Ty Tagami with Capitol Beat New Service, and that's a GPB contributing\npartner.\nThank you for being here.\nOn this first day of the Georgia Legislative session, 2026.\nSo let's talk about this.\nAs Sarah mentioned, we have, it's an election year and then we have people running for\noffice who are, who did not step down during this time, explain, explain why some left\nmaybe and some are still around for people who don't understand that.\nYou cannot fundraise during the legislative session if you're in office.\nIt's a significant handicap and it's hard to get out there and beat the campaign trail\nif you have to be at the Capitol every day, so I think that that's a significant reason.\nBut we'll still see a lot of them talking about trying to get camera time, I think, and\ntalking about the legislation that they're supporting that they think will help.\nAnd so they're still there.\nThey want to have some good legislation to go back to their districts and say this is\nwhat I did.\nYeah, absolutely, this is the last chance to perform\nfor their constituents, right?\nThat's true.\nNot only are all 236 seats in both chambers\nup for election, but every constitutional office\non the ballot.\nAnd so there's a lot in terms of that too, in terms\nof how people are going to be looking at what they do.\nSo maybe do you think we'll see a lot\nof the cultural issues come up this time\nbecause there's so many eyes on them?\nWell, historically, that's been a big thing,\nthat we've come up, seen come up in election years.\nThat's something that certainly gets a lot of media attention,\nwhich we've said they often chase during these years.\nBut, you know, leadership in both the House\nand the Senate Chamber have said that this is going to be\na year where they're focused on the kitchen table issues,\naffordability being the biggest one\nthat I hear over and over again.\nOkay, I want to tell you about those,\nthe lawmakers who are running for office.\nSo, in the Senate, there is Lieutenant Governor Bert Jones.\nseeking the governor's office.\nThere are three Republicans and one Democrat running for Lieutenant Governor, two Republicans\nfor Attorney General, one Democrat hopes to become insurance commissioner, and a Democrat\nand a Republican have their eyes on U.S. congressional seats.\nIn the House, two Democrats are running for governor, a Republican is looking at the\nLieutenant Governor's seat, a Democrat is buying for the Attorney General's office, and\nAnd one person has thrown his hat in for Secretary of State.\nAnd then there's one making a bid for U.S. Congress.\nSo a lot of that going on.\nAnd as we mentioned, a lot of competition for making sure they're getting out there.\nAnd so the fact that they can't raise money, those who left are doing just that, right?\nYeah, they're out there.\nThey haven't, you know, we don't have any reporting required for fundraising yet anytime\nsoon, but I assume that they're out there beating the bushes and taking advantage of\ntheir free time.\nOkay.\nSo, let's get into some of the big issues that we're hearing about already affordability\non both sides of the aisle.\nThe speaker is pushing for property tax relief, so talk a little bit about what he's\nlooking to do.\nYeah.\nI mean, one thing that the speaker brought up in his pre-session press conferences is\nthat some Georgians feel like they're being crushed\nby increasing property taxes.\nAnd so he's looking to work with some of the local\njurisdictions who are the ones who control property tax\nfor an area to see what they can do to reduce that burden\non Georgians.\nBut we don't have any specifics yet on that.\nNo, not yet.\nWe're hopefully this week.\nWe'll see some stuff unveiled.\nAnd the Senate is taking a very different approach\nto the tax relief.\nYeah, so talk about that a little bit.\nYeah, so Senate leadership is saying one of their priorities\nis to reduce and eventually eliminate the income tax in Georgia.\nWe've seen it decrease the past few years,\nand they're hoping for another big cut this year.\nYeah, and there was a study committee\nover the summer led by Chairman Blake Tillery,\nwho was the appropriations chair and the Senate\nto look at all of this,\nand he has figured out a way to make that happen.\nTalk about that.\nIE has numbers.\nI'm not sure if they'll all pencil out in the end.\nYou're gonna need a lot of revenue to make this happen,\nbut he has an immediate short term.\nproject of cutting eliminating the entire income tax for people and the first $50,000\nbasically and then an individual makes and that would cost about $3 billion in the first\nhalf year which you know I think that we could swing that in with the current revenues but\nthen when it becomes a full year it'd be six billion bucks and so that's where they're going\nto be you know starting to dig and he wants to go farther than that he also wants to take the\nbase rate down to 4.99 percent, which, you know, there might be broader enthusiasm for\nthat.\nAnd one of the ways he wants to do all of this is by eliminating a lot of the tax breaks\nthat are out there.\nWell, that would be part of the discussion in the future for some of the deeper digging.\nYeah, he's talked about, there's $30 billion in tax breaks on the books, but some of them\nare for, you know, for the police benevolence fund or for schools.\nBut some of them also for data centers and for different corporations.\nAnd so I think that there would probably be some enthusiasm for eliminating some of\nthose.\nBut I don't know if they can eliminate, you know, they would need 10% is what do you\nremember the $3 billion for the other half of the six billion?\nThat's where he would get that, 10% of that 30 billion.\nAnd he's talking about doing this like phasing it in up until 2032 up.\nWell, that would actually be pretty immediate.\nIt would be January, it would be the next fiscal, well, the current, half way through\nthe current, the next fiscal year for the first half, the $50,000.\nBut then in the following fiscal year, it would be a full fiscal year.\nSo it would be $6 billion.\nThat's for the $50,000 alone income, your first tax bracket.\nBut they also want to reduce the overall, right now it's $5.19.\npercent and they want to cut that to 4.99% and so that's more money and so\nthat's a lot in play and he wants to bring that down to zero in 2032.\nThe main thing is there's still a lot to do to get to the point where people can\nsay I have no more income tax there's still so people were thinking that's\ngoing to happen right away it's not going to happen right away. Well and then\nyou have the speaker the house has an important role in the budget and the\nspeaker was asked and he's like well we're interested we want to see the\ndetails. That's true. The math. Yeah. So let's get on to something else. Education is always a big area\nfor legislation and it looks like high school students may never, they may be losing access to their\nphones in school. That's correct. We've seen it for the younger ones. Speaker Burns says that he's\nhoping the house will pass a ban on suffans in schools for 9th grade through 12th grade.\nAnd as you said, as you said, we've seen that ban for K through 8th grade already.\nAnd so now they're discussing extending that to high school.\nThey feel like they've really seen a lot of benefits for kids and for teachers with this\nK through 8th ban and they're hoping to see it keep going.\nOkay, we'll see how that one goes.\nBut I think there's some popularity there where the parents, we didn't know how was going\nto go for the 8th graders and younger, but it seems to be going well.\nThe Wellhust hog supper, which was last night, I talked to Democratic representative\nFloyd Griffin of Millageville.\nHe has a push of legislation to repeal the promise scholarship.\nIt's a $6,500 voucher that an eligible family can use for things like tutoring or private\ntuition.\non Amazon and, et cetera,\nbuying products that probably\ndidn't have anything to do with\nthem going to school.\nThere are some students going\ninto the private school,\nand for whatever reason,\nthey are being their parents\nare taking them out,\nand they're going back to public\nschool. See, that money,\nonce it goes to the private\nschool, it does not come back.\nSo he is saying that the system right now\nis being abused by some people,\neven though he is pushing back on that.\nThe Republicans want to even increase\nthe promised scholarship in some way.\nThey haven't said yet, but there's some\nwho are looking either to increase the amount of money\nor the number of students who can have eligible.\nThis has been on the agenda for years and years\nand they finally did after some very squeaky votes.\nthey finally did get the voucher into law.\nAnd yes, they're gonna want to expand it.\nSenator Greg Dolezal, who is one of those senators\nrunning for higher office for Lieutenant Governor,\nis Vice Chairman of the Appropriations Committee.\nSo he'll have a say in the budget.\nAnd he, this was his baby.\nI mean, he's been pushing vouchers for years.\nAnd so I wouldn't be surprised at all\nif he would like to see either an increase\nin the value of the voucher.\nIt's $6,500 right now.\nor in the total appropriation.\nSo more students could participate.\nAnd we always get the pushback on the other side\nthat this is hurting public schools.\nLawmakers are expected to revive some bills\nthat didn't make it through both chambers last year.\nAnd Sarah, one of those is SB 30,\nwhich would prohibit prescribing or administering\nhormone therapies or puberty blocking medications.\nTalk about that a little bit.\nSo this is an issue we've seen a lot of movement on\nover the past few years.\nSeveral years ago, we saw a ban on surgeries\nhormone replacement therapy. This bill was originally intended to ban puberty blockers as well,\nwhich are often given to transgender minors to prevent them from going through puberty.\nBut we've seen some amendments in the past year. It looks like now it's been watered down\nand just add a bunch of additional requirements before they're able to prescribe those drugs.\nAnd it passed the Senate, but it was stalled in the House last year. So we'll see if they pick it\nback up. Yeah, we're expecting to hear that. Now, the wildhog supper, I also spoke to\nrepresentative Matt Reeves of Duluth.\nHe is taking the baton to once again,\nonce again, try to get a vote on sports betting.\nWe're not asking House members to implement this.\nWe're asking House members to let the people of Georgia vote\non this question of online sports betting\nwith the money going to literacy\nand pre-K with the lottery.\nJust last week during the peach ball\nin the end, an organ came here to Georgia.\nBoth those states have legalized online sports betting.\nthey have a transparent, accountable with their lottery\nand the money's going to education.\nNot $1 in Georgia has gone to education\nfrom online sports betting.\nSo Ty, is this the year the sports betting gets a vote?\nWell, you know, all of this is like a big Rubik's Cube\nwhen you get into the budget and you push here\nand you have to pull there.\nSo something else we have is a hope scholarship.\nIt's very popular.\nIf people start spending their money on sports betting\ninstead of hope, that could have an impact on\nimpact on and that's a cherished you know that's a cherished fun so I think you\nand obviously we've seen pushback from religious communities in the past so\nyou know I don't know could happen but this is a perennial issue yeah so there's\nso much we didn't get a chance to touch on so we may have to have you back but\nthanks so much for getting us started on the first day of lawmakers thank you\nboth for being here thank you so coming up we will take a look at the amazing\nwork done to glam up the gold dome.

They were restored all this and then added some\nmore detail of adding gold into that.\nWe wanted a little Georgia gold everywhere, Georgia gold in here.\nUp to and a half stories were standing atop a complex skeletal framework comprised of\ntons of connecting pieces of steel, mass of scaffolding built on house floors so old\nthey needed showing up first.\nThe weight of the scaffolding is quite heavy, so we had to have a lot of engineering to\nbe done to make sure we didn't collapse this scaffolding to the bottom floor, so we replaced\nall the flooring that's in the building.\nThere were still, we went back to the original timbers that were from the 1800s.\nRefreshing every inch of the chambers required engineering precision, balancing preservation\nwith safety.\nIn that enormous wooden box.\nThis is our chandelier.\nThe chandelier will see downstairs as boxed up, protecting it.\nIt's been cleaned.\nThey're going to be putting new lighting in there.\nArtisan's meticulously restored everything to its original neoclassical look of the late\n1800s.\nThere have been over 60 painters that have just worked in this building.\nWe have artisan painters that are here doing the detail work.\nThey actually started on that detail work in their shop in New Haven, Connecticut,\nlast January. So they went through a selection process. There's probably three\nhistorical painters in the United States that do that work.\nKind of a knob color and that's one of the store colors that has been in the\nhair for a while. But it's been more pink. There's been a lot more pink. There's\nmore what we call it like a pepto bismal pink. That was an\nbrought in and so that was been more replaced with some of the ball.\nThe restorations not just cosmetic, it's comprehensive right down to the air\ninside the building. They repaired plaster damage from the humidity in the building.\nOriginally, the domed ceiling opened up to let out hot air inside the chamber.\nIn the building and from the people discussing things. I would imagine there was quite\na bit of hot air. Now, the HVAC systems last time it was replaced in the late 50s.\nSo it was definitely needed to be done. So we're proud to have that and have good quality\nair in here and try to maybe keep it a little bit cooler to keep\ntempers down if they need to.\nWe leave the house.\nWe're in the Senate chambers.\nSo we started the restoration project in the House of Senate\nChambers back last May, or this past May.\nAnd so we're wrapping up in here.\nOn this day, the scaffolding is gone,\nand they're working on wiring and new carpet.\nIn here, there's new stain on the wood.\nEvery piece of wire has been pulled.\nEvery item has been either touched in some way.\nWe have new HVAC and air systems in the building,\nhandling that.\nWe have a new stain on the wood, new paint on the wall,\nnew gold in the gilded areas,\nand the chandeliers have been cleaned.\nThey are putting new wiring in a building,\nnot built for the kind of electricity we use today.\nWhen we ripped up the floors,\nwe were able to do new duck work throughout here.\nSo just in the Senate chambers there's over 36,000 feet of\ncabling just in this small area that we have here and in the\nhouse chambers there's over 76,000 feet of cabling in there.\nLawmakers will have better access to computers and phones with\nUSB ports and chargers at their desk.\nAnd where are those desks on this day?\nThe desks are being restored down in the depot. We turn the depot,\nthe Georgia depot into a workroom. So we've been doing the\nthe restoration of the desk that had been on-site. We didn't let them leave state\nproperties so the workers have come in there to do that. Chairs were a little\nbit more of a challenge. The chairs have far outlived their usefulness so we\nactually have replica chairs that are coming in. Some of them are original\nchairs from the turn of the century. Not the most recent turn of the century, the\none before those long ago 1990s. Now to the carpet. It's very similar to the\ndesign of before. There's some modifications because I did not know this, but all the\ncarpets have copyright design on there. We've got this design. It's actually out of\nDalton, Georgia. So, Charles Carpet is our provider for that and very proud of what\nthey were able to produce for us. Georgia grown, of course. Contractors, architects\nand craftsmen, many Georgia taxpayers themselves, treating the capital as a shared legacy.\njust being part of this project,\nthis is more of a sense of pride\nin giving back to the state.\nThey've all taken this as their ownership\nand that they're all taxpayers here in the community\nand they're proud of what they're doing\nand you can just tell by the quality of work.\nModern systems carefully hidden,\nnow support a building first completed in 1889\nthat hadn't been restored in 30 years.\nAnd even then faced challenges\nunder House Speaker Tom Murphy.\nThe story goes that they were going through\na pretty extensive renovation\nand they had to cut off a few corners with them\nbecause Speaker Murphy got tired of all the time it was taking\nand so he told him to get out of this chamber.\nSo he was, that was one of the things\nthat Speaker Burns has been very helpful with us\nto make quick decisions.\nNew ADA access, open committee rooms,\nand redesigned stadium seating for the public.\nThis phase of restoration in the chambers began in May\nafter careful planning to finish everything\nby the end of October.\nWhat are you most proud of about this renovation process?\nBeing able to get it done in the timeframe that we have.\nPreserving history, restoring dignity,\nand preparing these revered historic chambers\nfor generations to come.\nIt was pretty cool to be up there\nand actually touched the ceiling.\nI can tell you that.\nSo you both were with Speaker John Burns\nwhen he showed it all off.\nSo what did you, what did he,\nHe seemed very excited.\nAnd he also announced today\nthat they did the entire project under budget,\nwhich I know all the lawmakers loved.\nBut it was so interesting to see\nthe different intricacies of the designs.\nYou wouldn't notice just walking through there\nand the significance of the DeLonica gold.\nThe carpet looks sort of like a Cherokee rose.\nThey would confirm that that's what the design was.\nBut of course, that's the state flower of Georgia.\nSo it was good to see all those details at close.\nAnd the carpet was copied.\nAnd the previous car, yeah, the previous car, but was copyrighted, so that was where.\nYou said you heard from some lawmakers, didn't you?\nYeah, and in the Senate, you can get up close and see them, you know, in their habitat.\nAnd they were like kids in a toy store, like, apparently the chairs were pretty rickety\nin the past, maybe even dangerous, and so they had musical chairs going on, so they'd\nswap out if someone wasn't looking, so they could have the chair that works.\nOf course, they're there for 40 days and nights, so they want something that works.\nAnd yeah, I saw them inspecting their chairs,\nkind of leaning back in them,\nmaking sure they worked.\nYeah, I even got a text from one of the senators\nof his USBC plug.\nHe loved it.\nI loved it.\nThank you both for being here,\nbecause that does it.\nAnd for lawmakers today, we'll be back tomorrow\nfor Legislative Day 2.\nSenate leaders from both parties\nwill join us to discuss their priorities.\nAnd we will explore how the rapid developments\nand artificial intelligence\nare prompting new legislation this session.\nLater this week, we'll have a one-hour show highlighting Governor Kim's annual State\nof the State Address.\nThat's his last one.\nWe'll have the Democratic response also.\nHave a good evening.\nKeep sure to all my mind\nI am safe\n",
