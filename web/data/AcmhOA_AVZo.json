Amen.\nThank you, Chairman Tarbon.\nI'll I will add to your comments before\nyour prayer. I just want to thank all\nthe members for all the work that's gone\non to this in this amended budget. Uh we\nhave done it in\nand I will speak to this shortly, but in\na very expedient time frame. And I want\nto thank all of y'all for participating.\nI know you have. I've seen you doing\nthat. And I just want to thank you. And\nthat I'm going to turn it over to our\nsecretary, Matt Barton.\nAll right. Chairman Hatchet. We are\nready for you. Present your bill.\nIs the mic on? Is the mic on? Just\nmaking sure it's not off.\nAnyway,\n>> all right.\nThought I'd kick off a little, lighten\nit up a little bit for the media. Uh,\ngood morning. House Bill 973, the\namended fiscal year 2026 budget is set\nby revised revenue estimate of 42.3\nbillion.\nIn addition to revenue growth, the\ngovernor's revenue estimate for the\namended FY26 budget includes $3.3\nbillion in undesated surplus funds for a\ntotal revenue adjustment of 4.5 billion\nor 11.9% over the original FY26 budget.\nWe are responsible stewards of taxpayer\ndollars.\nAnd unlike some other states that you\nmay read about, we do not spend\nneedlessly or wastefully.\nOur per capita state spending is the\nninth lowest in the nation. And we don't\nconsider revenue growth to be a blank\ncheck for more spending. Since 2021,\nwe've given back $9.7\nbillion dollar to our taxpayers through\nrebates, tax cuts, and other measures.\nWe'll continue that tradition by giving\nback even more money through this\nbudget.\nWhile the governor's budget\nrecommendation recognized funds to\nprovide income tax rebates, our amended\nfiscal year 26 budget reallocates\nthese funds to provide property tax\nrelief for Georgia's homeowners, funding\n$850 million for the homeowner tax\nrelief grant program. This grant will\nmean that this year's property tax bills\nwill be just a little bit easier to\nswallow. As we continue our work to\neliminate property taxes on your home,\nwe'll have the opportunity to address\nincome tax burdens for our citizens\nlater this session through HB 101, which\nwill bring our tax rate to 4.9%,\nkeeping Georgia one of the most\naffordable states to live and raise a\nfamily in.\nOn the spending side, the House amended\nFY26 budget responsibly appropriates our\n42.3 billion in revenue. Allow me to\nhighlight some of these key investments\nwe're making.\nOur budget has two statewide items that\nyou will see over and over in nearly\nevery program. The first recurring item\nis a one-time salary supplement of\n$2,000 to full-time regular state\nemployees and school personnel.\nOf this $624 million of total funds,\n$384 million is designated for preK\nthrough 12 teachers, school nurses,\nnutrition workers, bus drivers, and\ncustodians.\nThe governor's 2027 budget\nrecommendation does not include\npayraises.\nSo, these supplements will help us\nretain essential staff and teachers.\nWhile not directly related to these pay\nsupplements, I will also mention that\nwe're also taking care of our retirees.\nWe've included $50 million for the\nEmployees Retirement System of Georgia\nto strategically invest in increasing\nthe funding ratio to improve long-term\nfinancial viability to the pension\nsystem and support state retirees.\nThe second recurring item is related to\nthe state health benefit plan.\nSHBP currently has a healthy reserve\nfund balance which the governor\nrecognized in FY27 by reducing how much\nstate agencies pay per employee per\nmonth for health coverage starting in\nJuly.\nOur amended FY26 budget passes these\nsavings on to the state agencies a month\nearlier. Starting in June, saving $21.5\nmillion.\nRunning a growing state is not cheap.\nAnd this budget spends over $300 million\nin workload adjustments, including K\nthrough2, Medicaid, corrections, health\ncontracts, and DHS out of home care.\nThese additions are largely associated\nwith our growing population and an\nall-around increased cost of doing\nbusiness in most sectors.\nSince 2024, we've used $4.1 billion in\nsurplus revenues to fund capital\nprojects with cash, saving taxpayers\nover $3 billion in debt payments.\nThe House amended fiscal year 26 budget\nalso makes a significant $82 million\ncash investment in new capital projects.\nIn addition to funding most of the\ngovernor's recommended projects, the\nHouse budget also funds a few noteworthy\nadditional projects. We provided $220\nmillion for a private prison expansion.\nWhile the new Washington County facility\nwill bring much needed safety upgrades\nto the correctional system, it does not\nadd additional bed space.\nThis private prison expansion will\nprovide an additional 480 beds for a\nsystem that's rapidly approaching\ncapacity.\nOur budget also provides $27 million to\nbegin design and construction of a new\nGeorgia regional hospital to address\nmental health and forensic bed capacity\nin our state. We're projected to have\nzero forensic beds empty by 2034.\nAnd this funding is a down payment on a\nhospital that will help address this\nneed by adding 200 forensic and 100\nmental health beds.\nThe House budget also provides $29.8\nmillion to design, construct, and equip\nequip a building that will house the\nbrand new college of optometry at\nGeorgia Southern University. Filling a\ntremendous need for our state, Georgia\nhas long sent has for long since sent\naspiring optometrists to study in\nAlabama and Tennessee. And with this new\nschool, hopefully the best and brightest\nwill see fit to stay right here in\nGeorgia.\nThese examples represent just a few of\nour priorities. You've likely already\nread the budget in its entirety, so I'm\nnot going to rehash every line, but I do\nwant to give you a few more highlights\nfrom each of our major policy areas.\nTo help keep Georgia mobile, our budget\nmakes several investments in\ntransportation.\nIn addition to the big ticket items of\n1.7 billion for the I75 South express\nlane expansion and $200 million for the\nState Road 316 interchange conversions.\nWe also provide additional funds for\nairport aid, rural rural bridge rehab,\nlocal road projects, shortline rail\nimprovements, and various local\nresurfacing projects\nto help keep Georgia educated. This\nbudget contain continues to meet our\nobligations in K through 12 and higher\ned fully funding our formulas and\nprojections for QBE charter systems\npromise scholar and special needs\nscholarships AP exams dual enrollment\ncompletion schools hope scholarships and\ngrants provide $88 million for major\nrepairs and rehab projects at USG and\nTCSG.\nAnd finally, we include $300 million to\nprovide state matching funds for an\nendowment to provide needs-based\nscholarships\nto help keep Georgia healthy. We provide\nfunds for new rural medical and dental\nclinics, nursing home quality incentive\npayments, and GME expansion.\nWe also provide funds for rural\ncolarctyl screenings and we direct the\ndepartment of public health to develop a\nstrategy to promote awareness and\nprevention measures for colarctyl and\nprostate cancer.\nOur\nbudget adds additional funds to out\nofome care to fully fund the deficit at\ndefects and reinstate foster care\nsupportive services contracts that we\nknow make a difference. We also provide\n$15 million for a new integrated child\nwelfare reporting system to help enable\nearly detection, speed up service, and\nincrease accountability.\nTo help keep Georgia safe, this budget\nmakes several investments in the\nDepartment of Corrections. We allocate\nmore than $185 million for capital\nprojects to make needed safety,\nsecurity, and technology upgrades to the\nGDC infrastructure.\nWe also provide additional funds for new\ncorrectional officer positions to help\nus get nearer to our goal of 1 to 11\nofficers to inmate ratio.\nand we add significant funds for rising\nhealth and food and farm costs.\nWe've also included some one-time funds\nfor domestic violence shelters and\nsexual assault centers for operational\nand facility needs\nto help keep Georgia growing. This\nbudget provides $35 million to the\nGeorgia Environmental Finance Authority\nto establish a state financing and\nassistance program for natural gas\ninfrastructure improvements and $50\nmillion for rural infrastructure\nprojects. We also support the governor's\nrecommendation of $50 million for the\nstate housing trust fund. These funds\nwill help address homelessness through\nmatching reimburseable grants to local\ngovernments and nonprofits and they\nbring with them up to a 4 to1 federal\nmatch maximizing the impact of our state\ndollars.\nThese items are just some of the\nhighlights of the 42.3 billion budget.\nThis budget lives within our means and\nwill help ensure Georgia remains the\ngreatest state to live and raise a\nfamily.\nI'd like to close by saying thank you\nfor all of your hard work to our\ndedicated subcommittee chairs\nand Christine Kaki and Dave Lackley\nleading the charge of the incredible\nstaff of the House Budget and Research\nOffice.\nFriends, we're voting on a budget a mere\n3 weeks after it was initially\nintroduced by the governor. It's no easy\nfeat to turn around a budget this\nquickly, especially with much mother\nnature throwing two icy snow events at\nus. We've been able to stick\nto an aggressive timeline in order to\nquickly get this budget across the\nfinish line. I thank all of you for your\nwork and commitment to the task and I\nask for your favorable consideration of\nHB973\nand I will attempt to answer any\nquestions.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Appreciate all\nyour hard work, too. Are there any\nquestions?\nCome on.\nWow.\n>> Wow.\n>> Oh, hey,\nLeia.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr.\nChairman. Um, am I hearing you correctly\nthat we are fully funding the deficit uh\nin DHS?\n>> Yes. 82 plus million dollars.\n>> Thank you very much.\nMr. Chairman, I see no more questions\nat this time. Do I hear a motion?\n>> Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I move that\nHouse Bill 973 do pass by committee\nsubstitute.\n>> All those in favor?\n>> I Any against?\nAnd it passes. You're good to go. We're\nadjourned. Thank you'all very much.",
