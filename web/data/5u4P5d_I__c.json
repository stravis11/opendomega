Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 179th House District. Representative Rick Townsend. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It's my honor to introduce Pastor Timothy McDonnell III. He's a Brunswick native. Husband, father, and pastor. Reverend Timothy McDonnell III is a founder of the African American Ministers Leadership Council. And the president of the African American Ministers and Action of People for the American Way. And the senior pastor of the first Iconian Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia. Where he has served since 1984, Reverend McDonnell III has taken first Iconian 35 members to approximately 1500 members. Reverend McDonnell has appeared on Oprah Winfrey Show, Good Morning America, the Bill of Raleigh Show, Nightline. The National Press Club is often quoted in USA Today, New York Times, Washington Post, LA Times, National Public Radio, and other national publications. Reverend McDonnell received a BA from Berry College in Rome, and holds a Master's at Divinity from Emory University, and completed some doctoral work as well. He is married to Miss Shirley Neil McDonnell, and their proud parents of three children, Nikisha, Timothy IV, and Ebony. I know Pastor Timothy by accident, really. I met a sister. It's a long time friend, Audrey Gibbons, and she called me up during a freshman caucus meeting, and said, hey, Rick, can you pick up a few books for me? Well, they're written by Dr. Bernice King, and therefore Martin Luther King event by Coleman Brunswick. I said, sure, I'll be glad to pick up a few books. Ten cases later, Pastor McDonnell III loaded the books in my car, and that's where I first met him, and realized he had a servant's heart, just like his sister did. He was part of the first integrated class at Brunswick High, and I believe the first black student council president as well at Brunswick High. He's in Ministers since the age of 16, grew up in 88 Brooklyn Homes, and that was the projects. We kind of talked about that. I went to Lithonia High School myself, and I didn't realize I was in Section 8 housing at the time. Nobody told me, you know, it was Section 8. And so we had a common bond there, and I think we all can live by this next quote, or next passage in the Bible, Psalm 3723. The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, handed a life in his way. He got us calling early, and we're a better place. Brunswick's a better place, Atlanta's a better place, and George's a better place, because of Pastor McDonnell's. And it's my honor to introduce him and welcome him to this Go Oniles Day at the Capitol. Thank you. Good morning. Mr. Speaker, thank you so much, and Representative Thompson, thank you, and to all of you elected officials, thank you, and to those in the Galleys. We're happy that you are joining this morning to participate in this democratic process. I'm very honored to be here, happy to be here. My father in the ministry served here for some 10 years. Some of you may have known the Reverend EC Tillman, a state representative. He licensed me when I was 16 years old, and ordained me, and I consider him my father in the ministry, and he considered me one of his sons. And so I'm honored to be here. I've been here before, even as a champion for the day. But today seems to be very special, because our state is one of the leading states in this country. And I believe that, even as an African-American, I believe that the state of Georgia is a good state. I've never worked in any other state but the state of Georgia, went to Barry College in Emory, and I'm a Georgia band. And I'm very proud of that, and very proud to be here this morning. I'm a Baptist preacher, and they told me five minutes. And then they say five-ish minutes. And so we'll see how the five-ishness goes this morning. But I try to be true to my time. And I want to thank you for your service, even before I began this morning. It takes a lot to offer yourselves to be an elected official in these times. And I appreciate all of you for offering yourself, because it takes a servant to offer themselves for these political positions. I want to draw out attention just for a few moments, Mr. Speaker, to Micah, the sixth chapter in the eighth verse. Micah, sixth and eighth. He has shown the old man what is good, and what is it that the Lord require of the... but to do justice, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God. It's one thing that man requires of us. It is something totally other. What God requires of us. And I know that as you sit here day after day, doing the legislative session, perhaps you have thought about what is that God requires of me. What is that... my spirit is calling me to do. And I think that's a good place to be. I've learned in my 47 years of pastoring that it is one thing to know about God, and it's another thing to know God. That is one of the fundamental principles of our faith. I know about Michael Jordan. I do. I know about him. But I don't know him. I know about Governor Kim. He's good governor in my opinion, but I don't know him. When I was in Sunday school, I learned a lot about God, but that didn't mean that I know God. Because when you know God, you conduct yourself in a different way. You think differently. You treat your neighbors differently. You look at the poor, the disenfranchised differently. You look at the person sitting next to you differently when you know God. Because what determines how we see other people is the lenses through which we view them. And it's one thing to say I know, and it's one thing to truly, truly know. The newly elected district attorney in Glen County, Keith Higgins, I spoke at the M.O. King commemorative service in Brunswick last month. And he gave me a medallion that said the Maka VI scripture. What is it that God requires of me to do justice, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God? It doesn't mean as an elected official into the gallows to be one who proclaims to be a person of faith, to do justice, to do is a verb. And it requires action. A lot of us, a lot of people think they don't get to hear them by talking. Some of us politicians and preachers and lawyers, we great talkers. And we take great pride in listening to ourselves talk. I know I do, I do, I confess it. But it says, do. What is that we do that makes a difference? What is it that we do towards justice? Not only for ourselves, or certain clans, or certain people, but for all of God's children. All of God's creation. Those that we agree with, those that we disagree with, those who were raised in public housing, and those who were raised in mansions. What is it that we do towards justice that makes us one? That's why I love reading the Bible. And I find the Bible, so number one bestseller in the world. People may not know that. The number one bestseller book in the world is the Holy Bible. To do justice, to not just talk about it, to legislate justice, and not just justice for a few, but justice for all. That requires a certain type of person, a certain type of human being, a certain man, a certain type of woman, to have a desire to do justice. So that when people look at you, when people converse with you, they look beyond you, and they see justice. They see the symbol of God. They see the mark of God, to do justice, to love mercy. Some of you may be aware that today is what we call in the Christian tradition. To this in fact Tuesday, and right now, Mardi Gras is going on in New Orleans. Both of my daughters are over there right now. Mardi Gras is the last day before Lynn, where you put to get all your sin and out. All your reveling out, all of your bad stuff out. You're sitting there and they're reveling and having a great time with the speaker, because tomorrow is Ash Wednesday. For 40 days you're supposed to be repentant. For 40 days you're supposed to be forgiving, more forgiving. To love mercy. To love, Mardi Gras have an association with mercy. It's not just to have some knowledge of mercy. But as elected officials, you will call to demonstrate mercy, which means you have to get outside of yourselves. To get outside of yourself, Dr. King said, we need leaders, not in love with themselves, not in love with money, but in love with justice, not in love with publicity, but in love with humanity. That's what you are called to do. That's what you are called to be as elected officials in the state. To love mercy. To epitomize mercy. To embody mercy. Lynn is a very important part of our church. For 40 days. I ask people to think of some things they can give up for 40 days. And then I ask them to think of things that they can take on for 40 days, like trying to be kind to vote. For 40 days, not cursing anybody out for 40 days. I know that's kind of impossible, you know, some of us. But what can I give up? But what can I take on? I'm going to be nice to the speaker of the House of Representatives for 40 days. Oh no. To love mercy. That's what we're called to do. To exemplify, to embody. And then to walk, umbly, without God. Pride counts before, before. To walk, umbly. To be a servant, you have to be humble, representative, Township. And I think you embodied that as well. That's how we met. Delivering books for little children, underprivileged children. 300 plus miles away. As a daughter of Dr. Marlotha King, Jr. To walk, umbly, without God, is one of the best traits that a person could exemplify. You mentioned President Carter. I met President Carter when I was at Ebeneers' about this church. As a full-time assistant pastor there, Daddy King still living as pastor emeritus. President Carter came to speak. Mrs. King had invited him to speak. I was in my, I was 24 years old, 25 years old when I met President Carter. You talked about a man. In my opinion, who exemplifies with this scripture, what he talks about. To love God, to love mercy, and to walk, umbly with your God. We keep President Carter, his wife and his family in our prayers. I want to be the best of me in 2023. That was my thing for the year, new years. I'm creating the best for me. I'm a pretty good guy. I am. I know this. Nobody has to tell me this. I'm a pretty good guy. But I know I can be better. I know I can be more loving. I know I can be more compassionate. I know that I can be more generous. I know that I could be more caring. So I want to create the best for me in 2023. Joshua 1 to 9 says, be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discourage.\n\nFor the Lord thy God will be with thee, whether so ever you go with. No need to be afraid. No need to be discouraged. Know that God is with you. Always, whether so ever you go with. What does the Lord require thee? But to do justice, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God, let us pray. O God, our Creator, the giver of all humanity, we thank you for this day, for these elected officials, these your servants, who offer themselves in service to humanity. We pray for a covering upon them in this session, that God you will impure them with courage inside, fortitude that will cause them to dream impossible dreams, and to fight unbeatable foes. Thank you for their willingness. Thank you for their courage. Now we ask this day that you will shower them with your blessings, that whatever they do might be pleasing in your sight. Thank you for our speaker, for all of the officers, for all of these elected officials. Bless God and keep them as they legislate on behalf of all Georgians is our prayer. We pray this prayer in faith and in the mighty name of Him, who says the perfect example of us for us, how to love one another, Jesus the Christ we pray. Amen. Join me in the pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic of which is thanks, one nation on the God, indivisible, with liberty, justice for all. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, sir. And the pastor will come to you. Thank you, Pastor. That was a powerful, powerful devotion. Thank you so much. Doorkeepers will unlock the doors. Members may greet the pastor, the chaplain, in the south any room. Thank you. Thank you. Chair recognizes Chairman Tarvan, the chair of the Committee on Information and Audits. Mr. Speaker, your committee on information and audits has read the journals in the previous legislative day and found it to be correct. And just something else to think about, the only way to truly avoid criticism is do nothing, say nothing, or be nothing. Well, Chairman, that's very profound. And this body certainly will not avoid criticism, because they're doing a lot. And they are much appreciated. Thank you, Chairman Tarvan. Is there any objection to dispense with the reading of the journal, the chair here's none? The reading of the journal is dispensed with. Is there any objection to the confirmation of the journal? Chair here's none, and the journal is confirmed. Mr. Clerk, will you please read the resolution establishing the order of business far of the day?

So we'll make sure that our doctor is recognized appropriately when they're able to give it. Representative Lepton, you'll come up and tell us about our doctor of the day. Thank you so much, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I wish to represent and present to you, Dr. Richard Kaufman, our doctor of the day. Dr. Richard Kaufman was raised and educated in the Amish Mennonite tradition. Police has been just remote. Members, we need your attention. Members, this is important. These physicians give their time to come down to me with us and take care of us, unless properly listen to their public service and your credentials, if you will. Representative Lepton, please receive. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Dr. Richard Kaufman was raised and educated in the Amish Mennonite tradition, spending his younger years on an Amish farm in Montezuma, Georgia. He was an Amish dairy farmer until the age of 26, and his education up to that point was strictly parochial through the eighth grade. He did not receive any further formal education until 1970. Dr. Kaufman then went on to obtain his undergraduate degree at Berry College, graduating Magna Cum Laude, and then received his MD from the Medical College of Georgia in 1976. He is a member of Alpha Chi of the National College Honor Society, as well as Alpha Omega Alpha within the Honor Medical Society. Dr. Kaufman speaks three languages, English, German, and Spanish. This has greatly helped him on his travels around the world, engaging in mission trips with the United Methodist Church and giving his time to volunteer with Haitian earthquake relief in 2010. Dr. Kaufman is currently an associate professor of medicine at Mercer University, works at North Atlanta Primary Care, and is a member of the AIDS Research Consortium of Atlanta. We thank Dr. Kaufman for all of his work over the years in many areas all over the globe, including South Africa, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malawi, and of course the great state of Georgia. Thank you, Dr. Richard Kaufman. Thank you, Representative Lepton Boy. Dr. Kaufman is pretty qualified. I'm surprised he has time to come mess around with us. Goodness, he's a busy man. And we certainly appreciate Dr. Kaufman. Hopefully he'll be able to join us so we can recognize him, but if not, I encourage you all to stop by and just say hello and thank him for his service to us. That completes morning orders. We're ready to move on to the rules calendar. Ready to move to the rules calendar. You ready, Mr. Clerk? Ask the clerk to read the caption to HB242-242. Hospital 242 by Reps and Epochins, 161st and others to be titled an act to amend Article 10 of Chapter 21, a title 15 of the Fish Go to Georgia Antietta, really, and the Georgia Drivers Education Commission. So it's a provide for additional penalty for violation of traffic laws or ordinances under John Sweslaw. This bill haven't referred to the Committee on Motor Vehicle. Second committee recommends that this bill do pass. Thank you, Mr. Clerk. Chair recognizes Chairman Hitchens to present the bill. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. This is a bill that I had last year and it went all the way through the House, through the Senate. And actually was the number two bill on the agenda when the Lieutenant Governor decided to give his go on the way speech, so it didn't make it. So I'm running it again this year. It's a driver training bill. It I'm doing on behalf of the Governor's Office of Highway Safety. And in 2005 Senate bill 205, known as Joshua Law, created a search ards on all traffic citations in Georgia. Originally 5%, during the recession it was reduced to 1.5%. The assessment of the fee sunset on June 30th, 2022, which was last June. When the bill to increase the fee to 3% and to remove the sunset failed to be bought to descend at floor on sunny die. House bill 242 reestablishes the search ards collection on traffic violations at 3% and will collect an estimated 5.3 million annually resulting in 10,000 drivers education grant scholarships awarded annually. Scholarships are currently awarded on a tiered priority system. First priority is given to grant scholarship applicants who are a child or dependent of a public safety professional disabled or killed in line of duty. Dependents and children of members of the United States military, killed in line of duty. And as a result of this bill last year, we incorporated into the rules and the Governor's Office of Highway Safety that foster children in the custody of the state of Georgia through defects will also get first priority. Second priority is given to scholarship applicants who can demonstrate a need based on family income. Financial need, eligibility is currently based on 175% of the free and reduced price school meal eligibility. Currently, including each month the program runs out of money and denies student scholarship applications because the man for the scholarship is so high. If more grant scholarship applications are submitted and grant scholarships are available in each priority level, grant scholarships are awarded using a computer generated random selection method from the priority level applications. Grant scholarships are evenly divided among Georgia's congressional districts to ensure that all Jordans are considered despite geographical location. Rejected applicants are automatically reconsidered for the next two cycles. Program is open to public high school technical colleges, universities and other state-owned driver education programs and privately owned commercial for profit driving schools and nonprofit organizations and private schools. Program awards driver education grant scholarships to students ages 15 to 17 years old who seek to complete a 36 hour 30 hours of classroom instruction and six hours behind the wheel of the vehicle. With an approved driver's education program a recent evaluation of the scholarship program showed that students who received scholarships were in significantly fewer crashes had higher road skills and higher test scores. They also have fewer convictions, fewer crashes and fewer serious injuries and fatalities from precedents students did not complete the 36 hour course. In calendar year 2022 there were 1,792 fatalities on Georgia highways. That's the second highest number of traffic fatalities recorded since 1974 behind the 2021 high of 1,818. Only four states in the country are ahead of us in traffic fatalities. That's California 3. California, Texas and Florida all who have double the population that we have in the state. So we very obviously have some some difficult drivers. The annual collection of the driver training fund is steadily clients since fiscal year 2017 as fewer citations are issued throughout the state. There's less law enforcement presence in the state and there are a lot of diversion programs. I'd be happy to take any questions if there aren't any. I'd appreciate your favorable consideration. Gentlemen, you have a couple of questions. How you representing Williams to your left is recognized for a question. Gentlemen, you look like you wouldn't go yield. But I didn't know it was going to be you. Is it not true? This is a very good bill and I support this bill. It is it not further true that you explain so much of it. I'm confused now. And thirdly, says this is your second year bringing it and three years of charm will see you next year. I hope not. Well, I won't say I hope not either, but I'm going to see the chair recognizes. Representative Kenner for a question to your left, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, you'll. I am. Isn't it true that I have that must respect for the author of this bill and the intention. However, I voted no in committee because I was concerned about the unintentional consequences and disparate impact financial impact on the poor because of the increase. And the fact that the broader poor community does not have access to the scholarship because it's not needs based. Because it's what not needs based. It is need based. The first the first year at need base, but the second year is need based. There's a third tier for all others, but the applications of exceated ability to fund them and it's never gone to the third tier. So everybody that gets it is either the child or somebody's been killed in the line of duty of foster child or somebody that has financial need. Would you yield for one more question? Isn't it true that I'm going to vote yes for this hopeful that the Senate will perfect it even further? Well, I certainly hope it passes. I that's a green vote, Mr. Chairman, I'd take it. Yeah, yeah. I don't know about the Senate though. Well, there's that part. Chair Lady Dimps, he's recognized for a question of your yield. Does the gentleman yield? Thank you so much. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you so much for bringing this again. I know it's really hard when we get measures through here and they almost get out of the other chamber and don't. But I want to make sure that you and everyone in this chamber knows that Josh was mother is a friend of mine. Right. She lives in Rome. She's a great mom. Her heart was broken at the loss of her son and what this does to carry on and help with the healing and help prevent those outcomes is so very important. Thank you. And I appreciate that thought. I've never talked to the mother, but I've talked to the father previously of Joshua and he has the same same feelings about it. Chairman, you have one more. One more. We have some Jasmine Clark from the one hundredth and eighth to your left. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Is it not true that prior to this lapsing because the Senate failed to vote on it? The fee was actually one and a half percent. It was. It was to bill last year tried up to three percent because of the demand. Does the gentleman further you? Are you just to clarify this is just a one time fee that will be tacked on to violations. Track any traffic violation. Well, my perspective is that those people who disobey the traffic laws make a dangerous for everybody paid to train those or future drivers so that they'll do better. Thank you. I yield the well, Mr. Speaker. Appreciate your favorable situation. The gentleman has yielded the well and we have no one who's speaking to the bill. So is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agree to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor, the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. For what purpose does Chairman Prince rise? Make a motion. I move that house rule except House rule 133 and be excused from this vote. So recognized and so done. Representative Mottehan, do you have a preliminary inquiry? Just pursuing a House rule 133 and I have to be excused from the vote. We can accommodate as well both of your excuse from the vote. If all members have all members now voted, all members voted. So the clerk will lock the machines. On the passage of the bill, the yeas were 161, the nays 9. The bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, if you'll read the caption to HB 243. 243. House bill 243, by the way, Smith, the 70th and others to be titled an act to amend Code Section 161562, the official go to Georgia, annotated, relaying the number of judges and the spirit courts. So as we provide for an eighth judge of the spirit courts of the Queeda Judicial Circuit, the spill have referred to the committee on judiciary. And that committee recommends the disbilled due pass by committee substitute. Chairman Lin Smith is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the House. This bill is very similar to a bill that's already passed the General Assembly this year. It was House Bill 77, which is a Darty County Judicial Circuit. So to draw a comparison for Yawa, you consider this bill, think of me as Gerald Green's for Donald Twinn. So this bill emphasizes the need for another Superior Court judge, the eighth judge, for the Queeda Circuit. This judge is needed to help, as most of these cases, to deal with a serious case load in my circuit. It has passed all the budgetary considerations that has the support of the community. It passed out of the committee unanimously and I ask for your favorable support. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Lady has no questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Are you the well? Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of the bill, the yeas were 172, the nays 0. The bill, having received a requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, if you will read the caption to HB80. House Bill 80, by representative Leber, to the 123rd to be entitled to enact a amend, Article 1 of Chapter 14 and Title 24 of the Efficient Coated George Anitenter relating to general provisions regarding proof generally. So is the enact the Uniform Unspawn Declarations Act. Just to elaborate for the committee. I'm judiciary. That committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. Representative Leber is recognized to present the bill. Representative Leber, thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, the House. I'm pleased to present you today House Bill 80. This is part of the continuing initiative that we've undertaken as a general assembly to assist with making Atlanta and Georgia a Center for International Arbitration. You may remember last year we passed the Uniform Mediation Act, which takes great strides toward that goal. This is sort of continuing that same move. It basically, it's got a very limited impact though, but in doing so, it's very important. It authorizes a court to consider a written statement that has not been signed before a notary. Apparently in pre-trial proceedings, that is before the trial, matters have to be considered by the court and the court rules on motions and things of that nature.\n\nthat needs to consider written testimony it does so by affidavit. That's a signed written statement that's signed in the presence of an odory. Most of the time, that's not that difficult or logistical step, but if you're overseas, that can be extremely difficult because you've got to go before a consular vice consul to get him or her to sign in the place of an odory. And that requires an appointment. It may take a lot of travel. And oftentimes, the appointments are months out. And not only are they months out, when you show up, the consul doesn't completely control their own schedule. That's controlled more by international events. And so you may miss your, not be able to attend. The consul might not be able to make the appointments. You have to then come back three months later. So it can be a very, very difficult process and during that whole process, the case is delayed, the disposition and the final judgment is delayed. So this would allow another option. It allows somebody who was out of the country to sign a written statement that while it doesn't have to be signed in the presence of a odory, would have to be signed under penalty of purgery. And the document has to be in a certain form where there's a notice above the signature saying that you're signing it under penalty of purgery. That's basically the same end result as signing in the presence of a odory. It's under penalty of purgery. And if you're lying, you can be prosecuted for purgery. So we simply add that as an option for civil cases and arbitrations when there is a witness who is out of country and needs to submit written testimony to the court. So it's fairly limited in its application. And this is not something new. It is new to Georgia, but it's not new. Federal courts have allowed this for about 50 years and somewhere between 20 and 30 states allow this in some form or the other. Some even allow you to submit a written declaration if you are located in the US or in state. We're not going that quite that far. It has to be a statement where you're signing when you're outside the United States, but it would greatly assist the progress of these cases, would reduce costs. It's a simplifying a logistical step to achieve the same end. And it will help, especially in these international cases, where we have businesses overseas or witnesses overseas and they can submit written testimony in that way. So the bill is supported and was actually initiated by the Atlanta International Arbitration Society. It's supported by the Board of Governors of the State Bar of Georgia, and it will help us not only in terms of making sure that arbitrations and cases can be disposed of more efficiently and quicker. It will reduce the costs for the parties involved. So I would request that you please do vote in favor of this legislation, and I will yield the well for any questions. Gentlemen, you yield for a question. I yield. To your left, Representative Clark has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does gentlemen yield? I yield. So what type of cases are we talking about here? Are we talking about criminal cases? Are we talking about civil cases? Both. As we say in the game show business, I'm glad you asked that question. It would not apply to criminal cases at all. We initially as filed it would have, but we subsequently revised the bill to exclude criminal cases. It only applies to civil cases, civil administrative proceedings before some government agency, or an arbitration. Does the gentleman my further yield? I yield. So it says that it will be under the penalty of perjury, but if the person is overseas or in another country, how exactly would that penalty be enforced if they're not in the United States? Well, there could be enforcement through the auspices of the court in that initial proceeding. It could exclude the testimony or it could penalize the party that offered the testimony. And at some point, they might need to come to Georgia and then they would be subject to jurisdiction of the criminal law. Thank you. Thank you for your question. Gentlemen, you have one more. I yield. Representative Thomas to your right. Oh, can I, can I rescind my yield, Mr. Speaker? To late now. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Just, is it not true that I actually enjoyed your speech is a lot better when you put Yogi Bear quotes in the front? I'm sure it is. That always does spice it up. Actually, I want to say, I think this is a good bill and I appreciate you bringing it. Thank you. I appreciate that question, Representative Thomas. Thank you. Gentlemen, has no further questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would ask your favor of consideration of House Bill Aiden. I yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? Excuse me, the chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? Chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Child, this bill now passed. All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill. All the yeas were 174, the nays 0. The bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to HB 186? House Bill 186 represent a lover of the 123rd and others to be titled an act to amend Title V of the Fish Go to George Annotated, relating to appeal and error. So as to revise an exception applicable to the filing petitions for review in reviewing courts from lower judicatories. This bill have been referred to the committee on judiciary. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. I hope you won't disappoint. You'll have some quotes this time. The gentleman has recognized to present the bill. Representative Leveritt. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Yes. As Yogi Berra once said, I know having me come back up or seems like deja vu all over again. But I have another bill that just happened to make it on the calendar day. House Bill 186 amends the state and superior court of public practice act. This body passed it almost unanimous in last year and it actually was signed by the governor. As you recall, it made a very significant change in the way you can appeal a decision of a lower court to a state or superior court. There was a very old archaic process called petition for search or rory that we eliminated in that context and replaced with a thing called a petition for review, which is much is clearly set out in statute. We try to answer all the questions that sometimes arise in those kinds of appeals and try to provide a more uniform simple process so that cases could get hurt on the merits, which is sort of the goal, I think, of our system of justice. Because it was such a significant change, it was a judicial council bill that had been working on for about four or five years. We made the effective date this July instead of last July. In case we missed a few things and we missed a few things. There were some cross references and other parts of the code to petition for search that we had to change to petition for review. There was one other section where we had referred to some exceptions to some of the standards of review and we only referred to one of them and we came back and just made it a little broader statement to make it clear that we're not trying to change a standard review. We're just trying to change the process by which you invoke that review. So it's it is literally a very simple bill and it just simply fixes some cross references that we didn't catch the first time around. So I'll yield for any questions, Mr. Speaker. It's not a simple bill, but you did a good job. So you have no questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen. I appreciate your favor of support and I'll yield the well. Thank you. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? Have. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill. The yeas were 173, the nays 0. The bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is thereby passed. Mr. Clerk, if you read the caption to HB 221, HB 221. Hospital 221 by the way, Mr. Lumpson of the 12th and others to be entitled back to amend code section 33921 of the fish go to George annotated relating to maintenance and filing rates, writing plans, rating systems or unwriting rules and examination of claims. Mr. Lumpson, this bill will refer to the committee on insurance. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair, Mr. Lumpson is recognized to present the bill. Mr. Speaker, members of the House, I bring to you House Bill 221. This is a department bill that comes as a request from the insurance commissioner. It deals with rate filings for automobile insurance. This bill keeps the current filing use modeled in place for the state mandated minimum filings and adds a 60 day waiting period for all other filings. This is a compromised bill that all affected parties have agreed to. It provides adequate time for the department to review the filings and provides a guarantee of speed to market for the insurers. Mr. Chairman, that speaker, that's the bill. I would appreciate your favourable support. Mr. Chairman, you will for a question. I will. You will for a question. I would represent you, Bayes Moore, from the 60 nights you are left. How's the question? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, Mr. Chair. It's not true that I've had a similar bill for a couple of years and I appreciate you bringing this bill and I support it. It was similar to how I did address this attack in a slightly different way, but I appreciate your concern for this. Thank you. Appreciate you all working together. I see no further questions, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Man, I'll yield the will. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is done. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? Chair here is done. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair here is done. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? The clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill. The yeas were 169. The nays 2. The bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. The clerk will read the caption to House Bill 279. 279. House Bill 279, my brothers and gentlemen, the 15th and others to be entitled to amend chapter 32, entitled 33. The fish go to Georgia annotated relating to property insurance. Those to provide for an insurance premium discount or rate reduction for property owners who build a new residential or commercial property. This bill has been offered the committee on insurance that committee recommends the dis bill do pass. Representative Gamble is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House are rise today on House Bill 279. You may be familiar with this bill. It's the same bill that we passed last year. 174-0 and it made it all the way over to the Senate. Unfortunately, we ran out of time on sunny day. But basically, what House Bill 279 does is that it promotes an insurance industry program called fortified, encouraging people to build more resilient structures. It is a voluntary and will remain that way under House Bill 279. It's a voluntary program. This is for people who do build to a fortified standard and have their structures certified as such. It would require insurance companies to offer a reduction on adjustment or a credit of some kind that they determine on their own. The insurance companies get to decide that incentive and again, that's completely determined by them. Consumers can shop around for better rates if they are not satisfied with the reductions in premiums. But it will help to bring insurance companies back into markets that are riskier. So if you live in an area that's more susceptible to tornadoes or to hurricanes, it could potentially help to bring insurance companies back into those areas. The insurance companies support this legislation. The insurance commissioners good with this bill. And again, this is a unique concept that we're starting to see where homeowners or those individuals building commercial properties can build to this fortified standard. And we're hoping to encourage more people to do that. So Mr. Speaker, that's the bill and I'm happy to yield for questions. The gentleman has a question if you're yield. I yield. Refined to clerk to your left has a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? I yield, yes. So a lot of times when they are discounting one person, they make up the difference by charging another person a little bit more. Is there any protections for those who don't have the funds to retrofit or fortify their places where they live? Are there any protections from them bearing the brunt of the discounts offered to those who do? I appreciate your question and I would say that I think the spirit of this legislation is to encourage those that build this standard and again, it's completely voluntary. It can be a retrofit situation where you retrofit your residential or commercial property or you can build a new residential commercial property of this standard. The insurance company will determine that incentive on their own but we're just trying to encourage that through this legislation. So to speak specifically to your question, I'm not exactly sure that I necessarily agree that that would happen but that is not addressed in this legislation. Thank you. With that Mr. Speaker, I would ask this body's favourable consideration on House Bill 279 and I yield the well. The gentleman has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favourable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. The report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favour of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of the bill, the yeas were 172, the nays won. The bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is there for pass. Will the clerk read the caption to HB 280, HB 280? The council is to be entitled to amend chapter 24, Title 33. The officer goes to George Anandt and relates to the insurance generally. So to provide for additional value added products and services that are excluded from being unfair trade practices and unlawful inducements and insurance. This bill ever further, committee on insurance, that committee recommends that this bill do pass. The representative gamble is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, it seems like it's insurance day at the Capitol today. I'm back with House Bill 280, another insurance related bill. And I want you to go with me. We were in the property and casualty side of insurance. Now we're over on to the life and health side of insurance. This bill builds off of a piece of legislation that we passed last year that allowed a property and casualty agent to offer a smoke detector, water leak sensor in the sale of property and casualty. What this bill does is it would allow a insurer for a life or health policy to offer a blood pressure cuff, a fit bit, some type of personal health device in the sale of life or health insurance. The product has to be a value that's reasonable in relation to the premium so this cannot be an expensive item. But the thought behind this legislation is that if you have that technology, it might help to minimize or lower your risk for stroke and high blood pressure and things like that. So that's what this bill does is it would allow those products to be offered in the sale of life or health insurance. With that, I'm happy to yield for questions. You have a question if you're yield. How will yield? Representing Bentley straight in the rear to your left. That's a question. Representing Bentley. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? I yield to my good friend, yes. Representative, explain to me exactly how house bill 280 is going to impact the funeral industry because when I hear you talk about life insurance, that definitely impacts my industry. This bill going to affect my method of payment so that I can buy a new hat. They are still going to come to you. It just may take a little bit longer. So you're saying does the gentleman further yield? I yield. So you're explaining to me the house bill 280 is going to delay my payment for the funeral industry? It could, but it will also help your workforce crisis right now because it could help you with some employees to assist with the work that goes on in your industry. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well, you have one more question if the gentleman will. I'm going to go ahead and yield and ask for your favorable consideration, house bill 280. Good answer. I think this will help the funeral industry know that about that in the right kind of way and the right kind of way. Is there any objection to the gentleman's yield to the well? Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, you do, yes. If so, the clerk will lock the machines. From the passage of the bill, the yeas are 172, the nays 2. The bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Let's see. We do have insurance today at the Georgia House. We certainly do. Mr. Clerk, well you read the caption to HB 294, 294. House Bill 294 by the motion of the Lodge, 167th and others to be titled an act to amend Article 3 of Chapter 37 of Title 33 of the Fish Go to Georgia and Tateau relating to procedures for rehabilitation. So it's a provide for the administration of contracts re-insuring life, disability income or long-term care policies or annunities. This bill I refer to the committee on insurance. That committee recommends the disbill do pass. And the Lodge is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. For all of you that have long had a burning desire to know more about reinsurance contracts and seating insurers in liquidation, today is your day. House Bill 294 is model legislation from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. This is not a department bill, but the department does support the bill. This bill deals strictly with life insurance, long-term care, disability income and annuity products. But provides for a means by which a successor to a company in liquidation and by that, I mean there are three possible entities. It could be the Georgia Life and Health Guarantee Association, which was created by this body in 1981. It could be the liquidator, which would be the insurance commissioner. It could and most likely would be an assuming company, which would be another life insurance company that was willing to step up and assume the obligations in return for the premium income from these products. It does one thing and one thing only for each one of these three entities, whichever one is standing in the place of the company placed in liquidation. Guarantees them the right to continue an existing reinsurance contract. There are many instances where that's a great advantage to the policy holders and to the assuming company or whoever is standing in the place to protect those policy holders. They might want to continue this reinsurance contract. The other thing it does is should these entities elect not to continue that reinsurance contract, there is a provision for settling accounts, figuring out which entity owes, which entity. And that can be a fairly complicated process and it's spelled out clearly in this bill how that's to happen. If there's no agreement on that it provides for arbitration, that's what it does and it does nothing more. It does not change any contracts. Does not deal with property and casualty at all. And Mr. Speaker, if there are no questions I'll yield the will. Well, Mr. Chairman, you do have a question. You do have a question and I have a statement. I'll, if you'll take this question I might answer my question. Yes sir. Chairman Corbett to your right has a question. Does the gentleman yield? I do. The chairman hits you and says, have you write that explanation? No but I'll remember next time to ask him. I don't think the gentleman has any more questions. So I'll lay the way. Well yes we do have a question. Chairman Carson has a question. I'm sure this will be spot on. Yes sir. Mr. Chairman. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? I do. I appreciate you bringing this bill. Is it not true that this updates our policies that are relevant when an insurer goes into liquidation including reinsurance contracts? That is exactly right. It spills out the procedure and gives us some certainty about what's going to happen with that contract. Thank you for that. Is the gentleman further yield? Is it not true that this policy, this model bill is also from the NAIC National Association and Insurance Commissioners? Like you said earlier. The gentleman so staged. Thank you very much for bringing this bill. Mr. Chairman you have no further questions. But I will let you know I'll lay the way. Most of the night pondering these questions on this reinsurance last night. Thank you for clearing them up. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? If so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill. The yeas were 174 the nay zero. This bill haven't received the requisite constitutional majority. Is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk if you'll read the caption to hb315.\n\n315. House Bill 315. My representative Taylor the hundred and seventy third be titled an act to amend chapter twenty four title thirty three the fish go to Georgia and it's had a really an insurance generally. So it's a reward for the commissioner of insurance from Paul McGate rules and regulations regarding cost sharing requirements for diagnostic and supplemental breast screening examinations. This bill I refer to the committee on insurance and committee recommends a dis bill do pass. Chair and chair lady darling Taylor is recognized to present the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Today I bring you House Bill 315. I'm working off of LC 520242. This is a follow up bill from last year. It has to do with mammograms and when you need a follow up for identity it allows it to be paid as a preventive. It's adding some wording and allowing the commissioner to be able to make the decision what these decisions are based based on. It had been limited in the previous bill to the January 1st 2022 and those updates come frequently so this allows him to make those choices. I'll be happy to answer any questions. I don't see any questions. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I ask for your favorable consideration. Mr. Speaker. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to bringing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill that the chair has done? The report report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of the bill the yeas were 173 the nays won. This bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. That completes our rules calendar. That completes our rules calendar. We'll now move on to afternoon orders. Representing Sheila Jones is recognized. She's patiently weighted and she wants to talk to us about some folks she had here today. Representative Jones. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, I rise today to recognize today as clock Atlanta University day at the state capital. We have with us the president of CAU, Dr. George T. French Jr. First Lady, Dr. Bashan Welch French, Marsha Taggart Jr. and Joleen Butts Freeman. Please stand and join me as we recognize and command the clock Atlanta University for their many years of dedicated service to the higher education of Georgia citizens and for attracting young scholars from across the nation to our great state. Thank you. Thank you, Representative. Representative Willis has recognized for an afternoon order. Representative Willis. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. I bring greetings and rise today to pay tribute to one of my favorite quotes. One of which includes those that don't got it can't show it and those that got it can't hide it. Zoranio Hurston is regarded as a folk-lorist and African-American author and anthropologist. In 1913, the president of the University of Georgia was the president of the University of Georgia's Department of Justice and Department of Justice. She published one of the most prolific works entitled Their Eyes Were Watching God. At age three, her family moved to Eatonville, Florida, which she regarded as her home. It was one of the first all black towns incorporated in the United States of America. sowed with S\u05db\u05dcone and her monochrome Account Everything FaSore Cos \u043e\u0436aventShe raisede\u00fcber upside-by, boys sleep in a unparalleled book Phenix Zora spirit in her intellect and allowed her to give her gift to us in perpetuity. She began her collegiate studies at Howard University in Washington, D.C.. and a beacon of the Harlem Renaissance. Hurston fused anthropological folkloric and black experiences to make her literary mark. But often when we make our mark, it is not always received and regarded with favor or support. She was known as the genius of the South. And when she died, her papers were ordered to be burned. But an officer friend of hers stopped by her home and assisted in putting out the fire. Then her collection was given to the University of Florida. She was buried in an unmarked grave until the 70s, until her sister, writer and friend, Alice Walker sought out her unmarked grave where it now reads, Zorneal Hurston, genius of the South, folklorist and anthropologist, and in closing, Zorne Hurston wrote that there are years that ask questions and there are years that answer. May this house now be an obsession that answers. I thank you for your time. I praise the creator for writers such as Zorneal Hurston who inspired black women like me to stand before you today and Mr. Speaker, I yield back the well. Thank you. Thank you, Representative. Chairman Jasper has recognized for an afternoon order. All right. Thank you, members. First off, remember you have board DOT board elections this afternoon. I hope you attend. But Mr. Speaker and members, we're glad that you are a speaker. The 75th speaker of the house, and we appreciate your dedication to us and the state of Georgia. I'm from the home of Georgia Marble, Pickens County. It's the stone of choice since the 1850s. Our Capitol building has over two acres of white and pink marble on the floors and the walls. From Pickens County, but especially, take Georgia. Evan Howell and the family of employees at Blue Ridge Marble have created you, Mr. Speaker, a name plate for your desk. Now it's all a headstone, but a name plate. Because we appreciate you so much. Thank you, Senator. Thank you. Thank you. That's what it looks like right there. So. Thank you. And well, thank you, members, and I appreciate the Blue Ridge Marble Company. Thank you, Chairman Jasperes. And to one of the things that makes Georgia famous is our marble. That is beautiful. I humbled to accept it. And if you don't mind, just do your best to get it in my office. I don't know if I'm not sure I can handle that. But I'm. But yes, we have many beautiful Georgia marble stones and our little country church's cemetery. And they will last through eternity. And we have much appreciate this. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Chairman Bonner has recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today to honor a great Georgian and a great American. This past Thursday, Major General John King retired after 41 years of service in our National Guard. Now, many of you know Major General King. His story is a great American story and a great Georgia story. Immigrating here from Mexico at an early age, joining the Armed Forces and serving four decades. Over that period of time, he led soldiers into combat. He served in peacetime and in war. And I'll just tell you, friends, oftentimes in these halls, we are star struck by celebrity and athletes that come through these halls and petition. But if you want to recognize and meet a legitimate American hero, you will say thank you to Major General John King for his 41 years of service to the state of Georgia and to our country. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We're representing Kennerds, recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. For a black history month, I would like to spotlight the person who was born in Louisiana to emancipated parents in 1870. As a very young man, he felt a call to preaching ministry and ultimately took his preaching ministry to Los Angeles, California, where God used him in 1906 to start a very important revival in the states called the Azusa Street Revival. It lasted for nine years from 1906 to 1915. And it was highlighted by an outpouring of the Holy Spirit that mirrored that in the book of Acts with the gifts of the Spirit and operation as well as healing and miracles. It got such national attention that it drew 1500 believers every night in the small storefront church on a Azusa Street. And one of the hallmarks was that it was a very deep multicultural experience where believers from all over, black people, white people, Hispanic Asians, immigrants, American citizens, young, old, rich poor, they all gathered there. And that was against the social norms of 1906 in this country, of course. And so from there, it gave birth to the modern pinnacle stool movement. Unfortunately, as multicultural as the revival was, once it formalized denominations, it segregated again, and it gave birth to white pinnacles of denominations, namely the assemblies of God, the tradition in which I was raised, and also the Church of God. Black pinnacles of churches were also born, namely the Church of God in Christ or the Kojik Church, as well as several black apostolic face. These believers a hundred years ago that experienced this outpouring, they would often testify in a church service, which would finish up their testimony by affirming, I thank God that I'm safe, sanctified, and filled with the Holy Ghost, and you'll hear that in modern churches today. So we thank you for the memory of William Joseph Seymour, who is important to black history and also to church history. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representative, for that history. Now, members, I want you to pay attention, as you've done, been doing here since we were doing after-nordes. Chair recognizes Chairman Chokus for an after-nord. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As many of you know, President and Mrs. Carter are my two most famous constituents. I've been asked about the news that President Carter is receiving hospice at his home in Plains. Well, we are all keeping him and his family in our prayers. President and Mrs. Carter are woven into the fabric of our community, even through their political success. President and Mrs. Carter have remained good neighbors and are active in the community of Plains. Just in the last few weeks, they were seen riding around in the community, checking in the sites. For the last few years, their son, Chip Carter, has been making weekly trips to Plains to visit his parents and attend to the family business. President and Mrs. Carter are both, as you know, devout Christians with an unshakable faith. They are both passionate about making this world a better place and through the Carter Center here in Atlanta, that's exactly what they have done. Fighting disease, waging peace, building hope. Again, please keep President Carter and the Carter family in your prayers. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Chairman Chokus. Not much you can add to that. Thank you. Representative Butters recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm here to recognize three of our own. There was a busy weekend and several people were honored. I'll do ladies first. We are here to recognize and celebrate with Representative Hewglie. 30 years ago, she started the AK that A Day at the Capitol. And so we're proud of her being recognized for that and bringing those fine ladies into the Capitol. And also Kim Alexander was recognized as a legislator of the year by A.K.A. So it's great that they all receive recognition. And then we had great fun. My family and I going to an event at the Atlanta History Museum Saturday night. Back in the day when Roy Barnes was governor, he was very upset that so many people in Georgia had to leave the state of Georgia to get cancer care. And he decided at that time we needed to establish some opportunities for people to get their cancer treatment here in Georgia and have an NIH approved cancer research program projects and hospitals. And that was the beginning of Georgia Corps. And one of our own chairman, butch parish, was recognized as a trailblazer for helping with establishing Georgia Corps, making sure it's still on the front burner when it comes to funding. And he's being shy, but he was the only legislator that was honored. So it was a really big deal after 20 years, Georgia Corps has helped save thousands of lives and have helped a lot of people live a lot longer. And it was a great night and it was a great honor and I'm proud for him. Thank you. Thank you, Representative Buckner. And congratulations to those that were honored by the way that some very impressive. We know the House leads in many different ways. Thank you all. Representative Reese has recognized for an afternoon order. And friends. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, it is with profound sadness and a shattered heart that I reflect on the horrific events and our hometown of Columbus, Georgia this weekend. 17 people were shot, including a five-year-old who were permanently losing eye. Five people died, including a 15-year-old, and a father and son in the same location. Mr. Speaker, people tired, citizens are weary. And they're not looking to blame anyone. This is not a democratic issue nor a Republican issue. When we are losing our babies and they are being harmed, we are all failing our babies equally. We must work to stop the problems before they even start. We must accept, fund, and embrace early-end adventure programs so that we can get our own youth before they are grabbed by the streets. Mr. Speaker, if you will, I would like to have a moment of silence for the five lives that we lost in Columbus, Georgia and all the lives that we lost this weekend to gun violence. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the will. Thank you, Representative, and certainly our heart prayers go out to those who lost this weekend.
