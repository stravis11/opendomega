Mr President\nrecognize the senator from the 42nd\nspeak to the amendment\nState you're inquiring\num Mr President isn't Senate Bill 222\nengrossed\nis it not true that Senate Bill 222\nisn't grossed let me let me check on\nthat Senator I don't know\nthank you\nsenator\nokay\nso the senator from the 23rd\nis correct on Senate Bill 222 being\nengrossed and so the amendment that the\nsenator from the 42nd uh offered is out\nof order and so Senator you can speak to\nyou Bill\nthank you Mr President uh colleagues\nthis is Senate bill 222. it's the\nmeasure that we've debated in the past\nhere it requires that all funding of\nprimaries and elections in Georgia be\nprovided through lawfully appropriated\nfunds it would limit and prohibit the\nuse of any external funds for elections\nin Georgia that is section two the house\ndid provide a substitute through the\nrules committee that is in section three\nthat section creates a independent it\ncreates an independence for the state\nelection board so the state election\nboard is an independent budget unit that\nis associated or affiliated with the\nSecretary of State for administrative\npurposes but is not under the control of\nthe Secretary of State it provides for\nuh\nthe ability for the state election board\nto be an independent body and administer\nits own affairs with that Mr President\nI'll yield for questions\nyou do have a couple questions Senator\nSenator from the 26.\nbut soon as the year but absolutely my\ngood friend from I think it needs to be\ndirected to to the to the governor\nif\nif it was engrossed in the Senate\nthen they went to the house and they\namended it and it's back over here why\nyou can't amend it\nthat's a parliamentary inquiry I believe\nuh well I'm asking the Parliamentary I'm\njust trying to get it straight it if it\nwas engrossed in the Senate\nbut amended in the house and now you\nasking us to agree to the highest\nsubstitute to the Senate to to to why\nyou cannot amend\nthe highest substitute to Senate bill\n222.\nSenator I understand the question I\ndefer to the president of the Senate\nthe answer is obviously when it's\nengrossed in the Senate not it's it's\nengrossed even when it comes back from\nthe house but we can't we can't engross\na bill over in the house\nas I'm sure you know having served in\nthe house for so long\nbut once it got it when it when it\nstarts here and we engross it and if it\ncomes back it's still considered engross\nas far as the Senate is concerned\nthank you Mr President if there are no\nother questions I'll yield well I\nrecognize the senator from the 42nd\nthank you Mr President when\num we passed SB 202 and HB um I think it\nwas HB\n316 yes HB 316 when we purchased the new\nvoting machines and SB 202 when we did a\nthorough rewrite of our elections laws\nboth bills created a series of unfunded\nmandates\non local governments in running\nelections\nlocal governments including mine who are\nunder a lot of pressure\nare completely understaffed\nseeking workers in a tight labor market\nthese election workers often face\nthreats\nand there's a labor market\nin addition local governments including\nthe one I represent in DeKalb County\nour elections board as I'm assuming is\nthe case for most of your elections\nboards have to go to the governing\nAuthority\nour County Commission to get funding for\ntheir elections board\nfaced with all of these additional\nrequirements\nput upon the the local elections boards\nby the state of Georgia\nall unfunded mandates local governments\ndid what I would think Republicans\nconservatives would think would be a\nsmart thing\nthey went out and in the pandemic year\nwhen the election was going to be\nincredibly difficult to conduct\nnon-profits took a look foundations took\na look and said we're going to have this\ngrant system that people can take\ncounties can apply to take advantage of\nand red counties did that and blue\ncounties did that\nthe shame of this bill\nis you are raising taxes\non all the locals because this body has\nput all these requirements on the locals\nthey are all unfunded\nand now you're saying we will not let\nyou be enterprising be Innovative be\ncreative and try to that all red\ncounties could apply for too fill some\nbudgetary gaps\nwhen the general assembly considers the\nfiscal impacts of the laws it\ndeliberates we should be considering the\nfinancial impact\nof both revenues and expenses\nand sb222 seeks to reduce revenues from\nsupplemental funding to local\ngovernments causing the local\ngovernments to have to make a net\nincrease in expenditures\nthe waiving of the fiscal note\nrequirement the statutory fiscal note\nrequirement for HB 316 and for um and\ncertainly for SB 202 is currently being\nlitigated because\nwhen the fiscal the the statutory\nrequirement to have a fiscal a fiscal\nanalysis of the increased burden on\nlocal elections boards was put before\nthis body it was raised in the statutory\nprovision that it was it was\num out of order to consider the bill\nwithout having an understanding of how\nmuch it was going to cost local\ngovernments and then meanwhile we had on\nour desks reams of paper as to how much\nmore it was going to cost local\ngovernments\nthat was um dismissed by the president\nat that time and and overruled and\ntherefore it is now subject to a lawsuit\nwhich wastes more taxpayer money that\ncould be used to Simply provide the\nability for our local elections boards\nin these heavily populated densely\npopulated counties to be able to run\nelections with efficiency so that we\ndon't have to wait in line for four\nhours let me just tell you that when I\nwon its early vote in DeKalb County this\nlast election we they have again\nenterprising we have an app where you\ncan look and try to the website to try\nto see where you can go of the early\nvoting locations where the line is the\nshortest\ngood very smart so I landed at\nHartsfield and I was like I'm a the last\nday of early voting I'm gonna go do it\nand so I looked on the app to see where\nthe line was the shortest and by the\ntime I got there\nthe line was already two hours long\nmaybe some of you don't understand about\nthat\nbecause you live in rural counties where\nyou never would would maybe wait for two\nhours I don't know I'm not trying to\ndictate what happens in your county\nbut I would appreciate the same respect\nfor those of us who have to vote in\nthese large Urban counties and and and\nand if you say you don't really think\nunnecessary tax increases are a good\nidea I would appreciate you not foisting\nunnecessary tax increases on us\nor at least own it say yes we do want to\ncab and Fulton and Cobb and Gwinnett to\nhave to raise taxes to run their\nelections and we and we and we certainly\ndon't think that's going to be necessary\nin our counties it just smells bad\nbecause it really looks at what you're\ntrying to do is make elections much more\ndifficult to conduct in large Urban dare\nI say Democratic counties and it's\npatently obvious\nand it's offensive\nand if you want to do that I say provide\nthe funding that we are required to\nprovide under the statute or own the\nfact that you intend to make it harder\nin urban counties and raise taxes in\nurban counties just so we can go vote\nand one of the amendments\nwas a bill that was heard in the house\nan excellent uh bill by a new\nrepresentative who's an attorney and who\nhas worked extensively on voter\nprotection matters\nand that Bill said that\num women who are pregnant\nor parents with small children in tow or\na child with special needs would not\nhave to wait in the DeKalb County\nthree-hour line because there's\ninadequate Staffing and funding so that\nwas going to be a great amendment to\nshow that what you really do care about\nis letting people vote fairly\nefficiently and safely and not forcing\npeople to wait in line for four hours\nbut what it seems like is you really\nwant to wait people force people to wait\nin line for four hours in the hopes that\nthey'll just leave\nand not come back in Democratic counties\nso\nif there was any notion in this building\nabout fairness and safety we would see\nit reflected in some of the bills we\nfiled we we filed the bill so that\npregnant women don't have to wait for\nfour hours we filed the bill so that uh\nanother amendment I was going to present\nso that individuals who who sought to be\non the absentee ballot rollover list\nwould be able to do so we filed the bill\nthat there can be poll workers across\ncounty lines we filed the bill so that\non Election Day the early vote centers\nare still open because guess what\neveryone gets confused\nwhen they try to go vote at the early\nvote Center just to be told oh sorry you\nactually can't vote here today on\nElection Day You've Got to Now sit in in\nAtlanta traffic and drive over to your\nPrecinct none of that has anything to do\nwith Safety and Security it has to do\nwith making people wait in line and\nmaking it as difficult as possible to\nvote in urban counties and if there was\na good faith effort to engage on this\nstuff I would not be standing up here\nletting you know exactly how I feel\nabout this but there just isn't and it\nis offensive that the minute my County\ndecided you know what we're not going to\nraise taxes on everyone in our County\nwe've got this non-profit with a great\noffer where we have been straining under\nthe unfunded mandates and the lack of\nresources to conduct our elections for\nthe citizens of DeKalb County and this\nFoundation wants to help and now you\ntake that away\nit really just strains credulity\nso this bill is terrible and when y'all\nare ready to engage on actually being\nstraight about running elections then we\ncan have a conversation about that but\nuntil then I think I've pretty\naccurately called out exactly what's\ngoing on in this chamber as it relates\nto voting thank you Mr President I yield\nthe well\nSenators yielded well\nI recognize senator from 37th speak to\nthe motion\nlisten I'm going to try to bring this\nback down to earth and then we can we\ncan get on this motion I\nheard the passion plea by the center\nfrom the 42nd I appreciate her concern\nfor fiscal accountability and and\nkeeping taxes low and all those kinds of\nthings but uh this issue is one of basic\nfairness I was talking to a group of\nschool kids not long ago and I raised\nthis issue with him it was it was it was\nthe question\num that was raised by the senator from\nthe 42nd I said um I want you to imagine\nfor me this was this was a group of kids\nfrom a from an urban setting\num I want you to imagine for me these\nwealthy outer lying Suburban counties\nthat have the dollars to keep their\npolls open longer to have more density\nof drop boxes and polls and oh by the\nway there were wealthy billionaires from\naround the country that sent dollars\ninto these counties to help support in\nso many ways to have more access to the\npoles shorter lines all these kind of\nthings\nand poor or struggling counties\nperhaps struggling Urban counties didn't\nhave the dollars to do that is that fair\nto have this inequity if private dollars\npouring into some counties\nto make it easy to vote\nand and being stuck on only public\ndollars in other counties and the kid\nsaid no that's not fair at all so it was\nnot not fair so these those counties\nover here these conservative counties\nwith dollar private money pouring in\nshould never be allowed to do that it\nshould be fair for everybody\nI said that's exactly right and that's\nexactly what we're doing it's just the\ncircumstance is fair for everybody\nwhat the lady raised was the the\nmillions of dollars pouring into certain\nconstituencies engineered by\nout-of-state actors who are trying to\nbring about an electoral outcome in\nGeorgia\nshocks the conscience of people across\nthe political Spectrum\nall Senate Bill 222 does\nbut what it does very well is make sure\nthat any outside Foundation dollars that\ncome to this state are spread evenly\nacross the state\nso there's equal access to all people\nand that outside entities can't\nprivately fund election outcomes in one\nplace versus another to accomplish their\nengineered outcome to try to engineer\noutcome\nfor certain communities Senate Bill 222\ndoes it fairly Senate 222 is not filled\nwith the some of the hypocrisy we've\nheard referred to here in fact I think\nthe shoe may be on the other foot this\nis a fair measure and those that oppose\nit are simply trying to engineer an\noutcome by private entities trying to\ntip the scale\nfrom from one side to the other on that\nMr President urge members to support\nSenate bill 222.\num\nSenator has yielded the whale\nrecognize senator from the 53rd\nSenator if you senator from 36 if you'd\nlike to come speak in the well you're\nwelcome to after the centers from 53rd\nthank you Mr President\nI just couldn't believe some of the\nstuff I've heard from the well on this\npiece of legislation frustrated that\nwe're going to raise taxes or somebody\nmight have to raise taxes for a free and\nfair election\nare you suggesting that perhaps private\ndollars would be better used in an\nelection as it's been done in the past I\nthink this is a wonderful piece of\nlegislation and I can't wait to vote\ngreen on something today thank you Mr\nPresident\nI recognize the senator from the seventh\nthank you Mr President I rise in\nopposition to Senate Bill 222 there's a\nsaying that don't cut your nose despite\nyour face there were red counties in\n2020 that also participated in outside\nfunding for their election boards\nincluding Cherokee Paulding Columbia and\nLowndes County any County can apply for\noutside funding this is like we why are\nwe removing a tool to help our election\nboard officials run better elections I I\ndon't understand like why we're doing\nthis why is this body again I mentioned\nthis before why is his body making it\nharder to administer elections I oppose\nthis legislation I encourage everyone to\nvote no thank you Mr President I yield\nthe well\ndoes any other Senator wish to speak\nforward against the measure senator from\nthe 23rd would you like closed debate\nthank you Mr President you know\ncolleagues we've been here before we've\nhad the same discussions the same\ndebates the same complaints the same\nrhetoric and the same false information\nokay let's make sure we understand\nyou can get all the third party funding\nyou choose to through the state election\nboard\nso anyone who chooses to can make a\ndonation to the state of Georgia and the\nstate of Georgia can equitably disperse\nthose funds it's pretty simple second of\nall let's talk about how long it takes\nto vote\nwell my good friend from the 37th excuse\nme from the 42nd my good friend from the\n42nd showed up on a Friday afternoon\nthe last day of early voting well no\nwonder the lines are long how long was\nthe lines on voting day anybody want a\nhazard a guess\n10 minutes 10 minutes you have three\nweeks to vote three weeks to vote and we\njust passed a bill Senate Bill 129 that\neven expands that by letting you take\ntime off during early voting we're\nexpanding early voting\nyou know uh\nI get a little concerned sometimes when\nlarge Metro counties are compared to\nsmall rural counties\nnow I want to ask a question\nare the votes in DeKalb County more\nimportant than the votes in Toliver\nCounty\nto Oliver county is one of the smallest\ncounties in Georgia it's primarily a\ndemocratic County but I protect their\nright to vote there's no difference in\nwhether you live in a Metro region or\nrural region the vote counts the same\nuh I appreciate the comments from my\nfriend from the 37th\nand I

act to\namend title 16 in the official code of\nGeorgia annotated relating to crimes and\noffenses so as to provide for mandatory\nminimum penalties for violations of the\nstreet gang terrorism and prevention Act\nthe house offers the following\nsubstitute to Senate Bill 44 a bill to\nmean title and act to amend code section\n5-7-1 of the official code of Georgia\nannotate relating to orders decisions or\njudgments appealable and defendants\nright to cross appeal so as to provide\nfor the state's right to appeal the\nCourt's deviation from mandatory minimum\nsentencing regarding certain offenses to\namend title 16 of the official code of\nGeorgia annotate that completes the\norder Miss president\nWilliam Jackson I recognize the center\nfrom the 50th\nthank you Mr President\nI rise today and bring you Senate bill\n44. this is a bill that we have uh\npassed through this body already it\nreceived a lot of debate this is a bill\nthat I'm bringing on behalf of Governor\nKemp I want to thank the governor for\nhis efforts in uh\nfighting gangs throughout the state of\nGeorgia giving prosecutors the tools\nthey need to be more effective I want to\nthank the lieutenant governor for his\nsupport of this bill and the Attorney\nGeneral as well\nuh there there's no room for street\ngangs in Georgia\nthis bill is going to help prosecutors\nacross the state\nit's going to help children and it's\nit's gonna\nreally provide serious penalties for\nsomeone that tries to recruit a child\ninto a life of crime by asking them to\njoin a street gang\nalong with the effort to crack down on\ncrime\nthe governor also seeks to add very two\nstraightforward practical changes to\nGeorgia's unsecured judicial release\nstatute by codifying what should be\nregular practice amongst our judges\ntoday\num\nfirst it provides that a judge may not\nissue an unsecured judicial release on\nthe basis of his or her own recognizance\nbasically a signature Bond if the\naccused person has been previously\nconvicted of bell jumping or has\notherwise failed to appear in court for\nin the last five years so that's a\nchange that was made over in the house\nsecond this bill makes clear that prior\nto issuing an unsecured judicial release\na judge must consider the accused\ncriminal history so before a judge\nallows somebody to get off and get out\nof jail on their own recognizance he has\nto he has to at least look at their\nprevious criminal history\nMr President this is a like I said\nbefore this bill has already received\nextensive debate in this chamber and for\nthose reasons I will respectfully ask\nfor your favorable consideration and I\nwill yield the will thank you Mr\nPresident\nSenators yielded the well I recognize\nthe senator from the 14th\nthank you Mr President the governor's\nbill is a bad Bill and the reason it's\nbad let's put aside the discussion we\nhad on SB 44 when it was first in this\nchamber first in this chamber right\nbecause you know we all remember that\ndiscussion about gang activity and\nrecruiting minors you know we made an\nargument as a minority party that uh sex\ntrafficking victims should be excluded\nfrom prosecution under this bill which I\nthink was such an obvious bipartisan\nmove that multiple members of the\nmajority came with us on that proposed\namendment uh but here we are we're back\nwith the original version of this build\nbut plus more uh more Provisions now\nrelating to cash bail but these cash\nbail Provisions are not limited to gang\nactivity this is across the board a\nchange in cash bail now our colleagues\nin the house maybe not you know minority\nparty in the house is not maybe the most\ncredible source of information to appeal\nto in this chamber but they said the the\nname Nathan Deal a lot just like I have\nsaid the name Nathan Deal a lot and I've\ntried to say it as many times as I can\nfrom this well because again then for\nthe umpteenth time there's a trajectory\ntowards Progressive uh or common sense\nbipartisan uh bail reform and that Trend\nthat Governor Nathan Deal took us on we\nare no longer on we are now in the\nopposite direction uh moving to\nCrackdown on pre-trial release I went\nactually personally to a pre-trial\nJustice Conference a few months ago\nwhere stakeholders from throughout the\nstate uh prosecutors defense attorneys\nnon-profit employees folks who think\nabout this problem came together to talk\nabout what we can do on cash bail and\none of the things or pre-trial release\nin general one of the things that they\nthey you know remarked is that we've got\nrules on cash bail that don't match up\nwith the data and one of the reasons we\ndon't have the data we make a lot of\ndecisions on pre-trial release in here\nthat are not Based on data in jails and\nacross the state practices to determine\nwhat actually promotes Public Safety the\nmost so you now are in a situation where\nif you look at line was 159 through 170\nof this bill or 169 actually it's 170.\nif somebody\nmisses court because they simply forgot\nand there was a bench warrant issued for\ntheir arrest which by the way is a very\ncommon practice have you ever been to\nMunicipal Court somebody's not there\nduring the roll call a lot of Judges\nwill just say bench warrant bench\nwarrant bench warrant\nif somebody gets one bench warrant once\nand that not even necessarily arrested\nnot even necessarily convicted\nthen that starts a five-year clock where\nthey can never be released on their own\nrecognizance for any charge within the\nnext five years now it does exclude\nnon-serious traffic offenses\nbut there are lots of offenses trespass\nyou know criminal damage to property\nwhere you know there might be a\nmisunderstanding again it's just a\ncharge in this country you're innocent\nuntil you're convicted\nbut if you happen to miss Court\nthen you start a five-year clock where\nyou have to use cash bail for literally\nany charge that person could possibly\nhave I want you to think about that\nyou have lots of jurisdictions that\ndon't have text message reminders don't\nhave clear uh you know reliable mailing\npractices to remind people when court is\nit may be that when you're pulled over\nthe citation you get is the only\ninformation you get about when you got\nto go to court\nand what if you lose that paper right\nor maybe you have to go into work on an\nemergency and you think I'll lose my job\nif I don't go into work today I know\nthat technically I've got a court date\nbut hopefully I can figure something out\nI've got to go into work or else I lose\nmy job\nso then all of a sudden if that bench\nwarrant is issued\nnow mandatory cash bill I mean really\nthink about that by the way this bill\nexcludes non-serious traffic offenses\non the bench warrant aspect of it but it\ndoesn't exclude non-serious traffic\noffenses on the flip side of it during\nthat five-year clock\nso let's say you missed court for some\nreason and there are plenty of human\nreasons to miss Court I mean we it again\nit's easy to stand up in this well and\ndemonize people who Miss court but there\nare plenty I guarantee you of basic\nhuman reasons why people Miss court and\nagain going back to my little you know\nflag in the sand if we had\nadministrative Solutions like sending\ntext message reminders in every\njurisdiction to get people to come to\ncourt people want to comply 99 of the\ntime but anyway so let's say you missed\ncourt now all of a sudden you get\ncharged with the you know improper lane\nchange or uh or speeding or your tail\nlights out now all of a sudden the judge\ndoes not have discretion for five years\nto let you go on your own recognizance\nthey have to put a cash dollar value on\nyour bail\nand what have we discussed in here\nbefore when it comes to one dollar bonds\nfive dollar bonds sure you'll see them\noccasionally\nbut the whole point\nof the bill before you\nand bills that have preceded it is to\nmake it more difficult for judges who\nare elected officials to issue Bond\ndecisions that look lenient\nso even if the judge is looking at a\npathetic case in front of them somebody\nwho you know really is on the line with\ntheir work their employment situation\nreally struggles to find transportation\nto get to court to get to their job that\njudge no longer has the discretion to\nshow Mercy to show compassion\nand if that judge is worried about the\nOptics they might say 500 Bond a\nthousand dollar Bond they don't want to\nissue a one dollar Bond or a five dollar\nBond\nso again you know this is the type of\nthing where we trust judges with\ndiscretion why\nbecause they see the human Elements Face\nto Face they know firsthand\nwhat the human being in front of them is\ngoing through way better than anybody\nsitting in this room so to take it away\ncategorically a judge's discretion\nto be not lenient but humane\nin situations where people are missing\nCourt once or twice that's not good\npolicy and it's not what the state of\nGeorgia should be doing\nuh and you know\ncoming up here when the result is baked\non a Governor's bill doesn't feel great\nbut I'm not going to miss an opportunity\nto try to remind everybody and hear that\nthese decisions are going to have long\nlasting consequences that make it harder\nfor people to live their everyday lives\nand stay in compliance with a Criminal\nlegal system that in here we are not\ncalibrating right now to be responsive\nto what human beings really need\nanyway\n33-23 Mr President I'll yield for\nquestions you do have some questions\nSenator recognize senator from the 37th\nor question\nthis is Jim and you I do I'm just trying\nto ask some clarifying questions here\nbecause this is um\nyou know there are a lot of things we\ntalk about the details that really\nmatter in this place but I want to make\nsure you know these details that you\ndescribed seem like they can really\nreally matter to people so I want to\nmake sure I'm clear because I don't want\nto act in either way on this without\nbeing fully understanding so what you're\nsaying is describe the circumstance that\nyou talked about failure to appear you\nget your one shot but then on the back\nside minor traffic offenses are not\nconsidered walk through a fact pattern\nor what you mean so we can understand\nwhat exactly you're talking about okay\nimagine thank you actually for that\nopportunity imagine this scenario here's\na real case that I dealt with when I was\nin law school Clinic up in Connecticut\nthey do things a lot differently up\nthere but human beings are pretty\nsimilar so this was a real case that\nhappened when I was in law school there\nwas a handful of friends who got invited\nover to a friend's house\nthe property owner didn't like this is\nlike an apartment complex Property\nOwners didn't like that the residents\nwere inviting too many people over at\none time so they had a standing no\ntrespass order on that apartment complex\nthat basically invited police to come\ntake away anybody the property owner\ndidn't really want to be there now again\nif you live somewhere you have a valid\nright to invite guests to your house or\nyour apartment that's just part of\nliving and so you know what basically\nhappened is a few friends come over\nthey're chilling they're not doing\nanything wrong\nproperty owner sees that there's a\ngathering gets police on scene\nthe the in the person who lives in the\napartment explains the police officer\nyou need to understand these are just my\nfriends I'm having them over right\npolice officer says well too bad there's\na standing no trespass order it's not\ntrespass but they issued the no trespass\norder those are charges right trespass\ncharges that's not a non-serious traffic\noffense right so it's a trespass charge\nso imagine a scenario like that police\nofficer hands you a paper citation which\nis a second like a copy of the citation\nthey keep\nand you lose that paper citation or you\nhave work or one of these scenarios that\nI'm trying to evoke in terms of why a\nperson would miss courts so if you\nlegitimately miscourt you're wrong but\nyou missed Courtney yeah you know the\ncharge is a charge maybe you're Innocent\nbut you miss court on the first charge\nand it's one of these jurisdictions\nlet's say it's a rural Georgia\njurisdiction uh that only has court once\nevery you know three weeks or whatever\nand it's kind of just a calendar call if\ny'all ever sat in court you know how\nthis goes the judge just moves through\ncases really fast if somebody's not\nthere bench warrant they're not here\nbench warrant right so underline 166 no\nbench warrant has been issued for arrest\ndoesn't say that they were arrested\ndoesn't say they're convicted warrants\njust issued on a person's failure appear\nin court within the last five years\nright and the non-tier traffic offense\nlanguage doesn't apply because we're\ntalking about trespass all right\nnow all of a sudden that person for the\nnext five years is locked in if they get\npulled over for a broken tail light the\njudges forced to issue a cash bail bond\ndecision so so what you're saying then\nis if that condition if you miss Court\nyou're wrong\nyou're saying for five years after that\nif you're pulled over for a traffic\ncitation any traffic citation you're\ngetting arrested getting booked and\ngoing to jail for that and and then you\nhave to make paper unless you post bonds\nsir and there and the reason is because\nunsecured judicial release is the only\nremaining way in this state that you can\nget released without cash bail on your\nown recognizance so in that scenario\nlet's say the judge is in a circuit\nwhere they have to appear tough on crime\nwhich is many judges\nand they don't want to issue a one\ndollar Bond I mean we hear a lot in this\nbuilding well maybe they can just issue\na one dollar Bond but as I've said from\nthis well before the then chairman no\nlonger chairman of anything in the house\nJudiciary Committee uh said that's the\npoint the point is that we force them to\npurport a dollar value so that judges\nwill increase the number that they're\nnot really going to issue a one dollar\nbond in many cases so let's say that for\nthat traffic stop you get a one thousand\ndollar Bond now you're in the territory\nof what we like to talk about minority\nparty which is criminalizing poverty and\nputting somebody in circumstance where\nwe just wreck their life a little bit we\nmake it a lot harder for them to comply\nand do things we want them to do they\nmiss their job you know they lose or\nmiss work they lose their job they miss\na family obligation they're not a\ncompliance with family or child support\nobligations all that I mean you you\ncompound all those problems when you put\nsomebody in that trap so Jim and further\nyield I do so you know we may disagree\non some provisions of cash buying I\ncertainly believe most folks have to\npass have to post bond for what most\nfolks will think about crimes we may\ndisagree on that\nbut I do want to make sure we have\nClarity so because I think I think the\nbipartisan whole of this body would\nwants to understand the effect of what\nwe're doing so if someone has a failure\nto appear in court they're wrong for it\nadmittedly you're saying I want to make\nsure we're clear\nthat if you're pulled over for a traffic\noffense\nyou're going to the house you can't just\nbe you can't deal without a roadside and\nmove on with your business anything\nbecause every traffic offense in this\nstate is a misdemeanor so if you have a\nbusted tail light you're trying to get\nfixed the next day and the officer\ndecides that they're going to issue a\ncitation cash fail no unsecured judicial\nrelease we may disagree three on cash\nbail and other offenses and I know we I\nknow that we do I just want to make sure\nthere's not unintended consequences\nabout folks that think they're going to\nget released on the side of the road for\na speeding ticket they're going to get\nput in a cop car and taking away and\nthey're they're after their evening\nchanges dramatically and that's a really\ngood point and I wasn't doing a good\nenough job of putting a finer point on\nthis I'm thankful to the center for the\n37th when a police officer issues U.S\ncitation and lets you go that is a form\nof being on your own recognizance and\nthe risk here is that if cash bail is\nmandatory just for a charge again you're\nnot convicted yet you still could be\ninnocent legally you still are innocent\nlegally police officer may be forced\nunder a bill like this to put you in the\ncar take you to jail until you can post\nwhatever the bond is that the judge sets\none final question so does uh does the\ngentleman contemplated an amendment\nhypothetically that would say if if the\nsubsequent offense in the five years was\na standard traffic offense you could\nstill be released on your own\nrecognizance there but otherwise could\nnot be released because I do think there\nare members in this body that draw a\nhuge distinction\nfrom driving 12 miles an hour of the\nspeed limit or 16 miles an hour speed\nlimit from shoplifting I have no issue\nwith someone getting booked and going to\njail for shopping although you may\ndisagree but I do see speeding as\nsomething different I want to make sure\nthere's a there's a way forward Senator\nsadly and tragically I agree with you on\nthis but the procedural posture of the\nbill makes us unable to make an\namendment at this point we could have\nmaybe you know moved to agree as amended\nand changed this but I'm not gonna I\nplay some games because we're all\npoliticians I wasn't going to play a\ngame today and do an agree as amended\njust to make that point take it out\nbecause ultimately I'm not going to vote\nfor the underlying bill so it was it\nwould be in bad faith for me to make\nthat motion knowing that I was going to\nvote no but here we are on the debate on\nthe actual motion before us not subject\nto Amendment and and candidly we might\nbe stuck you know you vote for the\nGovernor's bill today I think you create\nthose sorts of unintended consequences\nand what I really wish is that the\ngovernor's office had had drawn the line\nat the the gang provisions of this and\nnot tried to put in this cash Bill stuff\nat the last minute senator\nsenator from the second\nSenator do you yield I do\nSenator does this bill reference the\nnumber of typographical errors that\nhappen when citations are entered into a\nsystem and a summons and a notice to\nappear may be sent out and the address\ncould be incorrect and so the intended\nparty didn't even get the notice and so\nis it not further true that while you're\ndriving you get pulled over and they say\nyou have a failure to appear for a\ntraffic offense for a summons that you\nnever received because somebody had a\ntypographical error in putting your\naddress on the summons is that not true\nCenter makes an excellent point you know\nthe Beatles said I you get by with a\nLittle Help from your friends and I'm\nthankful to the centers for raising\npoints I didn't address in my main\nspeech if you this provision here just\nsays a bench warrant has to be issued\nbased on failure to appear it does not\nhave an exception for an unlawfully or\nmistakenly issued bench warrant so to\nthe Senator's exact point if there is a\ndefense effect in the notice that you\nreceive to go to court for whatever\nreason typographical error mistake of\naddress that sort of thing then if the\nwarrant is issued in your name for the\nfailure to appear you are stuck under\nthis bill it does not matter that it was\nunfairly issued that five-year clock\nstarts to run\nuh further questions Senator yes what is\nthe remedy in the judicial system for\nsomeone who has received bad notice or a\nbad summons to appear before court\nbecause of a typographical era how would\none correct such a remedy in our\nJudicial System how would one fix that\nunder this bill there isn't a remedy\nCenter\nfor the question okay so if a individual\nwere to be held in another County\nbecause I drive up I-16 and let's say I\nget stopped in one of the counties on\nI-16\nand I had a ticket and I forgot about it\nand they mailed it to the wrong address\nwould I beheld and the Twigs County Jail\npotentially for a missed notice in\nanother County because I got pulled over\nthere and they saw that I was missing I\nhad a bench warrant Senator tyr point\nand it's what I've already said if the\nwarrant is issued in your name for a\nfailure to appear it does not matter if\nthere are any circumstances that lead to\nthat by mistake this bill is then\ntriggered and there is a five-year\nperiod in which you are unable to get on\nrecognizance release and final question\nSenator is there any way for the average\ncitizen to go and check to see if they\nhave a warrant anywhere I mean how do\nyou find out I mean I'm sure many\nmembers of this body don't even know\nthat if they may or may not have a\nwarrant somewhere how do we know I'm a\nmember of this body and an attorney and\nI cannot tell you off the top of my my\nhead if there is some comprehensive way\nin every jurisdiction to find out if\nyou've got a bench warrant for your\narrest when exactly your court date is I\nthink it varies by jurisdiction but the\npoint here is y'all this is look we come\nup here and we argue against your bills\nand we say hey this is a bad one vote\nagainst it this is a mistake I mean this\nshould not be in this bill and your leg\nto stand on in terms of passing a\nGovernor's Bill the gang stuff would be\nso much stronger if the house had not\nadded this Bond language it's a really\ntough position to be in I get it but I'm\nasking my colleagues sincerely please do\nnot let this happen today\nuh uh got one more question Senator\nfuture take it recognize senator from\nthe 53rd\nthank you Mr President will the senator\nyield I do you said 33-23 do you think\nthat might be changed to 31.25 I'm I'm\nsimply a humble man uh Senator and I\nwould not uh take for granted any of my\ncolleagues votes I was just making the\nrhetorical point that when it's a\nGovernor's Bill typically you get a\npartisan split but I think that there is\nsome interest in the body today just\nlooking at people's faces that this\nissue is a tough one senator\nthank you Mr President\nSenators yield to the well\ndoes any other Center wish to speak for\nagainst the measure\ncenter from the 50 50th you can close\nthe bay\nthank you Mr President uh once again I'm\ngoing to ask you to vote uh in favor of\nthis bill to address the concerns of the\nsenator from the 14th this was not a\nlast minute bill\nthis bill has been vetted this bill has\nbeen worked and\nif you do not show up for court and you\nhave a bench warrant\nlet's say you had work and then you go\nback to court you tell them hey I didn't\nshow up then the the warrant will be\nrecalled\nand once the warrants were called The\nFive-Year clock no longer applies that's\nwhat it says in the bill\nit says that this sub paragraph shall\nnot apply if such warrant was recalled\nsecond\nfor mistaken identity bench warrants\nif a person\nobjects to their criminal history\nthen the burden then shifts to the\nprosecutor to prove that the criminal\nhistory is accurate so the two concerns\nbrought up by the senator from the 14th\num while I respect you they have been\naddressed we have thought about those\ntwo concerns and I asked your favorable\nconsideration of this Bill thank you\nvery much the Senators yielded the whale\ndoes Indiana Senate which speak for\nagainst measure\nhearing none\nthe senator has moved\nto agree to the Senate bill\nand those in favor of his motion will\nvote yay those opposed nay secretary and\nlightning machine oh\nhow many Senator Mr President at\nDepartment of inquiry station inquiry\nwe've got 53 seconds to ask it\nI'm not clear what we're voting on I'm\nnot clear the effect of this bill and I\nI was just trying to ask the gentleman\nto say it's been addressed\nif someone's got a bench warrant I don't\nmind them going to jail but if someone\ndoes not have a bench warrant but\nthey've simply been had failure to\nappear in five years and they go to jail\nfor getting to speak they have an issue\nwith that Mr President and I don't know\nif parliamentary\nhow do we address that Senator I\nunderstand it but at the end of the day\nwhere the votes already started so it's\ndown to a red or green decision\non the paths of the measure the yeas are\n30 and the days are 20.\nand this having directs the\nConstitutional majority is therefore\npassed\nI recognize the procreations chair for\nthe 19th promotion thank you Mr\nPresident I move the center degree to\nthe committee conference committee\nreport to house bill 19.\nsecretary read the caption\nCommittee of conference on House Bill 19\nrecommends that both the House of\nRepresentatives and the Senate received\nfrom their Physicians and that the\nattached Committee of conference\nsubstitute to House Bill 19 be adopted\nrespectfully submitted by The Honorable\nLake tillary Center 19th

for the\nstate fiscal year beginning July 1st\n2023 and ending June 30th 2024. that\ncompletes the order Mr President\nrecognize the senator from the 19th\nspeak to the measure\nthank you Mr President I'll be brief\nthank you appreciate that\nI was going to ask whose grave he got\nthose off of but I think some people in\nthe out in the Halls may already be\npredicting that\nmight be mine\nuh Mr President I bring to this body the\nconference committee report\nto House Bill 19 the states fy24 General\nAppropriations budgets 34 32.4 billion\nit funds every agency\nfrom this body the legislature to\nVeterans at the end and the services\nthat we provide for our veterans\nthe big highlights you already are aware\nof we were able to maintain the Senate's\nposition on quite a few things\nthe 500 now comp waivers are reflected\nin this budget\nmoney oh yeah listen that's fine with me\ngo for it\nmoney concerning dyslexia is in this\nbudget I do want to point out it has a\ntrim remember that that\nthe effective date for that is fy25\nso there was a trim of about a million\nto try to balance out funds\nhope is that 100 percent\nThe Hope numbers the way we were able to\nfund hope public and private at 100\npercent was by using updated numbers for\nof students our USG population has been\ndeclining as you know\nso that helped us save a little with a\nlittle bit of savings there and by\nupdating those numbers we think we can\nmake both of those fit in the program in\nLottery funds\nshout out also to our commissioner at\nLottery who has done a tremendous job\nover the past three years of of\noutperforming revenues and we know\nthey'll do that again\nhoteling\na major focus of this body money's in\nthis budget address hoteling substantial\nfunding at DHS to begin to continue\npreparing for pandemic unwinding\nthe tasks that we have placed on DHS\nthough that's been placed on all states\nto unwind uh after that after the\npandemic though is daunting I am so\nappreciative of that staff of\ncommissioner Bros\neven with these increased funds\njust the man hours to do it are going to\nbe so difficult and we're we want to\nmake sure she has all the support from\nthis agent from our body that she can\nbut the task is not going to be easy\neven with funding sometimes there's\nthings dollars just can't do\nwe also took in and put into this budget\na policy concerning our child caring\ninstitutions\nbecause of changes at the federal level\nwhat's called Federal 4E funding is not\navailable to many of our group homes\nthat help foster children in the past we\nneed them to make a conversion so\nthey'll still be eligible for those\nfederal funds we provided roughly 18\nmillion dollars for them to get our 15\nmillion dollars now I think had to\nColeman in the conference committee to\nget ready for that and we hope we can\nincentivize and move those bodies\nquickly so that we can continue their\nFederal funding\nofficer pay most state officers receive\na six thousand dollar pay raise many\nothers receive a four thousand dollar\nPace a race at Regents and University\nsystem of Georgia there was a cut as you\nknow in this when it left this body of\n80 roughly 80 million to the teaching\nformula and 18-ish million or so too\num\nInsurance the insurance money was\nrestored the reduction at teaching is\nnow 66 million with the direction that\nthey focus on their carry forward funds\nto help cover that cost\nalso point out remember that to that\nenrollment's been declining\nwhen they can there's probably other\nways that businesses would use to to\nhandle that as well\nsomeone asked for a reporter carry\nforward funds is 504 million in October\nof 22 when we got the last report we get\na report roughly every October\nat dbhdd 117 million dollars towards\ninitiatives concerning mental health and\nin developmental disabilities the Senate\nthe conference commence Conference\ncommittee's Final version has 47\nadditional million dollars on top of the\nadditions that were made for the\ngovernor this body has focused on\nfunding\nconcerning mental health and I believe\nthat 117 million dollar addition for\nthis year shows our commitment\nbuildings\nget ready for the list\nwe have funded buildings at Valdosta I\nmean at Fort Valley State University\nNortheast North Georgia College sorry\nUniversity of North Georgia ffne\nGeorgia State University Kennesaw State\nUniversity Columbus State University\nDalton state O'Kelly Library the\nCedartown Library the Georgia Military\nCollege Denmark Library the

of\nCoastal Georgia and then a review of\nQuick Start facility for rivian most\nlikely Morgan County Georgia\nI told you this earlier that we may have\nto have a longer discussion about\nbuildings moving forward the planning\ndollars I cannot promise you that we're\ngoing to be able to fund the buildings\nfor next year with the planning dollars\nwe have now\nit's going to be a longer discussion we\nexpect to have with the governor's\noffice and with the house as we move\nforward after this budget hopefully\npasses\nbut that's one two three four five\ntwenty four buildings\nor planning and design for such building\nand the bonds that would cover that in\nthe next year would be substantial\nother highlights are going to reflect\nthe highlights you saw for the FY 24\nbudget\num\npreviously that I brought to you\nI think these are the high points that\nyou many of you are already aware of and\nmany of you have come to me and asked me\nquestions at my desk before we got here\ntoday\nMr President thank you so much for your\nleadership on this budget I appreciate\nyour trust in me your trust in our staff\nthank you for being so very involved\nfrom the get-go as we discussed\nparticularly issues concerning Mental\nHealth\nand hope and your commitment this body\nwould stay at 100 for the Hope\nScholarship\nI know our staff's listening I want to\ntell them thank you again I want to say\nthank you to Chairman Hatchett for his\nwork and to OPP direct OPB director Farr\nand his team for the work they've put in\nI hope this is a budget that you can\nfeel\nreflects matters in your district and\nthings that your constituents have\nbrought to you\nMr President with that I will yield for\nquestions or if there are no questions I\nwill yield thee will you do have some\nquestions Senator recognize senator from\nthe second\ndoes the distinguish Appropriations\nchair yield yes sir\nSenator I've got a just a few questions\nuh being a Freshman Senator I'm\nintrigued by what you said about the\ncarry forward balance from the\nUniversity system of Georgia and I'm\nalways ever concerned about the agencies\nthat have you know half a billion\ndollars like the lottery\nUSG can you talk and explain potentially\nhow they have so much money and how did\nthey get it because I thought all\ndollars had to be appropriated by this\nbody and so I'm just trying to figure\nout how did they get a surplus of\n504 million dollars yeah um well the\ncarry forward fund report which I\nbrought up here I think I might have to\nbring it up here and talk about it\nbefore it has been emailed out to each\none of you it is sitting in your inbox\nright now so if you want to look at that\nreport you can you'll see that the\nsecond page lays out each University\npage five lays out the balances and how\nthey got there some of them charge\ntuition some of them charge technology\nfees some charge indirect recovery costs\ndepartment sales and services and over\nand they're allowed to keep those funds\nwe passed a bill that you remember the\nformer senator from the 37th opposed\ngreatly uh Senator tippins I think we\ncan say his name if he's no longer a\nsenator who said hey we need to really\nfocus in on this and where this\nfunding's going and that those funds\ntotal right now about 504 million\nfurther questions sir uh with a carry\nforward funds does that money stay with\nthe university system or is it at the\ninstitution\num kind of can you explain that to me\nbecause when I look at\nsection uh article 8 section four\ndealing with the Board of Regents and\nthe university system could you explain\nthat a little bit too as well thank you\nuh it's at each University if you get\nthe carry forward report you'll see how\nmuch is at your University uh in each\none and I I know Savannah State is\nobviously on your lapel pin that's one\nthat would matter to you it's going to\nbe at page 80\n86 you can see how much they have in\ncarry forward funds some schools have\nmore than others and if you look at uh\ncarry forward funds for in October 2022\nfor Savannah State it's going to be\nroughly and I'm going to add them up\nacross the bottom 2.4 plus 720 it's\ngoing to be roughly 3.4 that 500 will\nleave it at three point uh six they're\ngoing to have almost 4 million dollars\nif I've Done Quick math and carry\nforward funds there now they're going to\nhave plans for using them but they have\nI'd say roughly 4 million dollars at\nSavannah State\narticle one section 8 that you asked\nabout specifically article one section 8\nis extremely clear and I'm glad you\nbrought that up\nthere's a lot of comments about that\nthis will be disproportionately\nimpactful to home smaller schools\nthat does not have to be the case\nyou see what you brought up article\neight\nsays that when we give money to the\nBoard of Regents the Board of Regents\nare in charge of how that will be done\nit's essentially a block grant so while\nyou do see budgetary items and titles\nteaching Skidaway Island other things\nunder the Regent's budget those things\nare program areas but we block Granite\nto USG they could spend it honestly any\nway they want if they come outside of a\nprogram area they will get an audit a\nding from the auditor they'll send them\na nasty letter and say you're supposed\nto be in this in this program area but\noverall they are constitutionally\nallowed to spend that money when it\ncomes to them as they please\nmy\nfinal question Senator so with what\nyou're saying uh from article eight is\nthat uh if the distinguished senator of\nAppropriations were to want to support\nSavannah State University and many of\nour other hbcus in the state of Georgia\nwe would just essentially be giving a\nblock grant of money to the university\nsystem of Georgia and they may or may\nnot spend that money as we intended is\nthat is that kind of what you explain it\nto me Senator that that's one way of\nsaying it I think it I think you're\nsaying it in the reverse that I was\nsaying it but both would be true that we\nnow in the past USG has we've separated\nout those program areas and they've\nstayed in those program areas but if USG\nspecifically in the teaching program\nwhich is where the 66 million reduction\nis if they wanted to say we're not going\nto apply this evenly across all schools\nwe're not going to apply it by the\nteaching formula we're not going to\napply it by square footage we're going\nto look at how much you have and carry\nforward funds and apply it commiserately\nto that they absolutely can do that\nwithin the teaching area and they won't\neven get an audit report on that but but\nwe can't tell them to do that\nthat's their constitutional building\nrecognize senator from the 29th\nthank you Mr President does The\nHonorable Appropriations chair yield\nthank you yes yes uh Mr chairman I\nappreciate the support of the Timber\nindustry that you and your staff and and\nthe house staff have have done in\ncreating this budget but look I'm just a\nsimple guy from Middle Georgia\nand when I look at the universities I\nthink about education so could you help\nme understand exactly how much money in\nthis budget do we budget for the\nteaching in the classroom the education\nthat we pay to send our uh kids to\nUniversity in the state of Georgia so\nyou're asking about University teaching\nspecifically that would be about that\nwould be about 2.8 billion dollars for\nteaching it's just teaching the just the\nteaching formula is 2.8 billion dollars\nso the reduction there of 66 it's\nactually if you want to get to specifics\nit's\n2.868 billion dollars so the reduction\nthat we're making is is in the third\ndecimals over there\num\nthe if you want to talk about USG as a\nwhole though it's going to be around 3.1\nbillion dollars thank you Senator that's\nright just to keep follow up on that if\nyou want to look at total funds not\nState funds it's going to be 9 billion\ndollars about 2.2 billion from tuition\nrecognize the senator from the 14th\nthank you Mr President as a senator\nyield yes sir uh I share some of the\nsubject matter interests of my\ncolleagues from like a comparative\nperspective I'm curious you know in\ncontrast to the Border Regents how much\nState funding goes to our technical\nschools good question it's actually\nabout a half a million dollars I think\nit's a half a million exactly this year\nso that would be if you're using State\nfunds to State funds so three billion\ndollar State funds to USG versus half a\nbillion dollars 500 million dollars to\ntcsg it'll be roughly 1 6. if you want\nto go further than that though you'd\nlook at total funds that's going to be\nroughly one billion one billion dollars\nat tcsg to nine billion dollars of T of\nUSG so it'd be a one to nine okay thank\nyou for that perspective Senator no\nproblem this is actually the questions\nwe ask in the back rooms I never thought\nI'd get asked up here let's keep going\nrecognize the senator from the 50.\nthank you Mr President does the senator\nyield yes sir could you uh kind of help\nme and go into just some detail about um\nthe other things that we fund at Regents\nsure we fund AG extension we fund\nlibraries we fund uh vet labs in Athens\nand Tifton we fund the Skidaway Island\nOcean research facility and at USG we\nfund forestry extension we fund teaching\nI think I already said Skidaway Island I\ncan keep going there's a lot of things\nrecognize the senator from the 21st\nand those are in addition to teaching\nthank you thank you Mr President\nchairman you yes sir chairman thank you\nfor all your hard work you the conferees\nand your whole staff\num just one question does the Board of\nRegents get hope money too\nYes actually so then if you turn in your\nbudget in student finance and you were\nto go to\num hope public that's going to be about\n885 million so on top of the 3 billion\nin state general funds The Hope public\nalmost all of that's going to come two\nregions it's going to go to the\nindividual schools based on tuition but\nyes sir that's an additional 885 million\nyeah freaking as a senator from the 53rd\nthank you Mr President will the senator\nyield yes sir uh isn't it true that\nRegents is the only Department that can\nretain its funds from tuitions and fees\nyes with a codicil let me give you the\ncottestyle so they are allowed by state\nlegislation that we pass in the former\ncenter from the 37th vehemently opposed\nuntil the end I think they may have made\na deal there at the end they get to keep\ntheir carry forward funds by Statute\nother agencies are going to have to ask\nOPB for permission to keep that\nauthorities keep their carry forward\nfunds like uh Georgia Congress Center\nand so those keep us just uh student\nfinance Authority they keep that but yes\nsir the Regents is different it's not an\nauthority and it does get to keep that\n504 million yes sir\nrecognize the senator from the 54th\nthank you Mr President Senator yield yes\nsir thank you my friend um are there any\nrestrictions on the Board of Regents\nsome is regard to spending\nas long as it's legal no and I'd go I'd\npoint you back to article eight when the\nmonies come to them they can allocate\nthem if they wanted to give every single\ndollar to South Georgia College they\ncould if they wanted to give every\ndollar to USG they could they obviously\nwon't but they have the ability those\nmembers who are appointed pointed by\neach congressional district and the\nchancellor and the USG central office\nhave the ability to allocate the funding\nthat comes to the teaching program\nspecifically but the Regents as a whole\nhowever they desire\nthank you thank you\nrecognize the senator from the 30th\nthank you Mr President this is a\nchairman yield yes sir so I'm trying to\nfollow you here I haven't heard anything\nabout foundations here\num yeah I know that there are some of\nthe schools are they at all the schools\nunder the regents\nthat's a great question I don't know I\nknow many of some have multiple\nfoundations but I don't know that every\nschool necessarily has a foundation I I\ndon't know that number I know some have\nmultiple\nokay that's the only thing foundations\nwould be the only way they the\nadditional way that the schools would be\ngetting Revenue into them that's a\nthat's an additional point so they would\nbe able to raise I know a lot of schools\nraise uh Foundation funds and they also\nuse Foundation sometimes to do real\nestate purchases Etc\na real estate like a sub entity under a\nfoundation\nor a sub entity under the university yes\nsir okay all right thank you yeah we we\ndon't I can't tell you how much in those\nfunds I'm not aware of any report of\nthat\nnot that I know of recognize senator\nfrom the 31st\nI think Mr President Senator we yield\nyes sir is it not true the region\nsubunits May owe more property than the\nactual regions themselves you must have\nbeen talking with the senator from the\n30th I I have heard that but I do not\nknow it uh but you're correct that I\nwould not have a way to know it I do not\nknow of a report that I have I may have\na report but I'm not aware of any report\nthat tells us about the subunits and the\nfoundations and what they own it could\nexist if it does I apologize I do not\nknow about it so there's so there's\npotentially not a report that tracks\npublic property\ngoing back to some of these institutions\nnow we're going to a great discussion\nthat we have in budget we actually have\nhad a discussion and a question raised\nfor us as to whether or not we have\nliability for those properties that are\nowned by foundations that might be what\nyou're getting at I don't know that has\nbeen raised for us because we don't know\nabout it we don't know but would the end\nuser be a university and thus the state\nof Georgia since it is owned by a\nsubunit of a university I think that's a\nvery good legal question that we would\nneed to know the answer to\nconsider you yield for one more question\nyes sir is it not true that yours truly\nused to cheer maybe not in the\nUniversity system but a foundation in\ntcsg and I in in one zone property\nthrough the merging of several colleges\nthis is not true that we've seen\nfoundations historically get out of the\nproperty business because of potential\nliabilities\num but senator may know of what he\nspeaks I don't I've never started on one\nof those foundations but thank you for\nthe knowledge you bring to the chamber\nrecognize senator from the 11th\nthank you Mr President uh Mr chairman\nyield yes sir\nMr chairman can the Board of Regents\nenter into contracts without the the\npurview or permission of the legislative\nbody yes\nthey can article 8 specifically allows\nthat I think that was part of the\ndiscussion that's been in this chamber\nthe only\nAvenue of involvement we have is the\nbudget\nrecognize senator from the six\nthank you Mr President does the\ngentleman in your yes sir uh related to\nthe senator from the 11th question\nthere has been talk about a mou between\nWellStar and Augusta University\nwould that come before the legislature\nbecause it's a state property like other\nstate property deals\nit would not it would never come here\nthe only purview we would have or the\nonly involvement we would have would be\nthe budget\nrecognize senator from the eighth\nthank you Mr President the senator to\nyou yes sir I've heard that there are\nover 25 employees of USG that make over\n750 000 a year is that true\nso you would be going back to an audit\nreport from 2020 or 2021 it's not\nopen.georgia.gov you can look up how\nmuch each one of us makes some of my\nconstituents do it and laugh at our um\nwell it's 17 000 salary not twenty two\nthousand dollar salary but if you ran\nthat report they're probably talking\nabout them running that report in 2021\nand in 2021 it would have showed over\n20. I don't know if it's over 25 uh\npeople at USG that make over 750 000 now\nthey're going to be some are going to be\ndoctors at auhs some are going to be I\nmean Kirby's smart will be one of them\num\nand then he's going to be paid by state\nfunds and then Foundation funds senator\nfrom the 30th talked about I think his\nState funds at the time was like 779\n000.\num but there were others as well that\naren't a UHS or uh or Kirby Smart\nsenator for the yield yes sir so those\nsalaries those are taxpayer funds right\nprobably\nsome could be at least with Kirby Smart\nyou know he's getting Foundation dollars\non top of that I don't know if those are\nall State dollars or not\num but there is a state dollar mix\nyes sir I guess that kind of goes you\nknow the thing institutions and I guess\nUSG set their own compensation policies\nso we don't have any purview into that\nrecognize senator from the 47th\nthank you Mr President I said then yeah\nwith the senator yield yes sir\none of the things I just got to ask when\nwe start talking about Coach smart don't\nyou think that's a great investment for\nthe state of Georgia to keep winning\nthat National Championship every year no\ndogs\nthey uh I'm not hearing a go dogs back I\nknow you you went school over there said\nthey uh twice twice they uh but one of\nthe things that uh several years ago we\nExempted the the university uh\nthemselves from from falling in as quote\nlobbyists but but don't most of these uh\nuniversities have somebody that's a\nprofessional that that's representing\ntheir interest because for me when I'm\nlistening to to this discussion I'm here\nand Time After Time After Time how much\nmoney we're putting into this and I\nthink it's working I think those folks\nthat are that don't most of these\nuniversities have an actual government\nliaison that is working for us\nSenator did you just ask me does do most\nuniversities have a lobbyist is that\nwhat you just asked me well in so many\nterms we don't call them lobbyists yes\nthey uh thank you Mr chairman said they\nuh uh just remember that that investment\nover in Athens it's worthwhile yes sir\nrecognize senator from the 17th\nthank you Mr President chairman yield\nyes sir\num chairman when it comes to the\nsecurity Ford funds is there any sort of\noversight or accountability as as to\nwhat happens that money spent by these\nschools\nnone to my knowledge and again the\nformer senator from the 37th spent a lot\nof time beating that point I think this\nchamber did too we do get that report in\nwe got in October of this year that\nshows how they spent the previous year\nit lays out how they intend to spend the\nnext year besides that that report we do\nnot have any say in that setting no we\ndon't if that's what you're asking and\ndo we have uh do we have the do we audit\nthem the next year to make sure they\nspin it the way they said the year\nbefore we we it will be just reading the\nyear's reports and seeing and comparing\nthe reports\nwe're gonna have a senator from the 52nd\nthank you Mr President with the chairman\nyield yes sir uh first of all we really\nappreciate the job you're doing for the\nSenate you make us proud\nthis carryover fund you and I were both\nCounty Commissioners and we had fund\nbalances which I kind of see this as the\nsame thing as a carry forward fund and\nsome gears we added to it some years we\ntook away\nhow much what percentage of this fund\nwould they have to use to fully fund\nwhat they're requesting for here the\nadditional 66 million\nso you can do quick math 66 million\nthey have 504 and carry four funds as of\nOctober I don't know if that number's up\nwith spring tuition or down uh it could\nbe lower could be higher but if you just\nuse the October figure and remember the\nOctober figure for this year was 504 the\nprevious year it was 550 so um\n66 million whatever percentage that is\nthe 504 is that going to be around 11\nish 12.\nyes sir put me on the spot doing numbers\nthank you\nrecognize senator from the 49th\nthank you Mr President do you yield yes\nsir\ncan we avoid that\nsenator from the 49th I think you've hit\non the point that uh many of the members\nhere I think are driving home with their\nquestions which is it does not have to\nand that question is left up to USG in\nthe Board of Regents if they want to\napply it across the board I'm sure\nschools that are smaller with less carry\nforward funds are going to be impacted\nmore but if they want to apply it\ndifferent differently they are not only\nallowed to they are constitutionally\nempowered to\nrecognize the senator from the 13th\nchairman you yes sir\nMr chairman uh Atco Cinemas everybody\nthank you and your team and uh\nAppropriations Committee for the work\nyou've done Mighty impressive question\nfor you yeah make me understand this so\nthe decision\nabout how teaching reductions will be\nmade are you saying it rests slowly with\nthe board of real regents yes it rests\nsolely with the Board of Regents yes\nthank you recognize senator from the\n22nd\nthank you Mr President Senator Yale yes\nsir first want to thank you for your\nhelp with the Augusta judicial circuit\nissue and hopefully next year we can get\nthat pushed through but thank you for\neverything you did there my question\ngoes back to block grants because I'm\nactually kind of still kind of wondering\nhow that process works is there ability\nfor the reasons to actually get blocked\ngrants from the legislature and how does\nthat kind of work there yeah I think\nagain we're still talking about that\narticle eight issue the funding that\ncomes from the legislature pursuant to\narticle eight is by article Eight's\nreading a block grant now if they do\nspend those items within different\nprogram areas of our budget that's laid\nout with the big thick black lines they\nwill get a nasty letter from the auditor\nbut in the line we're talking about the\nteaching line with the 66 million dollar\nreduction there's over there's what did\nI say it was 2.8 is a billion\nand at a 3.1\nso the percentage here I think we're\ntalking about is again\num\nmuch less than other agencies have seen\nrecognize senator from the 16th\nthank you Mr President chairman yield\nyes sir thank you for all you do great\njob of putting all the paperwork\ntogether and everything as I listen to\nwhat you've said and listened to the and\nwhat I can read the Board of Regents\nwould get roughly over three billion\ndollars plus another\n885 million from Hope is that is that a\ncorrect number yeah that's a fair way to\nlook at it it's 3 billion in state funds\nwhich when they run through other\nfederal funds and tuitions Etc ends up\nbeing about 9 billion and then and that\n9 billion would include the Hope funds\nhope public which is 885 million yes sir\nit's almost 4 billion yes sir close\nthank you\nand I hope that folks when they talk\nabout with our state spending over the\nyears has decline they will look at that\nhope number too those are I would say\nState spending\nrecognize the senator from the 28th\nthank you Mr President\nMr chairman do you yield yes sir to the\ndistinguished rules chairman so we've\nbeen throwing some numbers around today\nand I just if you will I want to make\nsure I understand this so\nthe Board of Regents is getting three\nbillion dollars\nin the budget\nand\nthey're getting\n885 million from Hope is that that'd be\nthe public hope number yes sir okay\nand if you'll further your yield so\nthey're also able to do this carry\nforward funds of what about 500 plus\nmillion dollars yes sir is that accurate\nokay so they get all that and then\nand then they get tuition on top of all\nthat\nyes\num two billion is 2.2 billion in tuition\nI I do think that though that tuition\nnumber and the Hope public number can be\nsqueezed together those might be kind of\noverlaying so I want to be fair to them\nthere but you've laid that out besides\nthe 885 sort of being in the tuition the\n885 hope public being intuition the rest\nof that is accurate\nwell thanks Senator that's a lot of\nmoney\nrecognize senator from the 56.\nthank you Mr President Mr chairman yield\nyes sir\nMr chairman I'm just trying to make sure\nI've got all the numbers together too I\nthink you mentioned that on top of three\nbillion dollars that we've spent in\nstate funds and 885 million more in Hope\nfunds\nand 504 million more in carry forward\nfunds aren't we also funding several\nbuildings for the University system as\nwell yes sir could you help elaborate\ntell me what that looks like yeah let me\ngo back to that first seat I let down um\nI'm gonna do rough numbers because I\ndidn't write these down I apologize and\nthank you uh Georgia state's roughly 50\nmillion Kennesaw State's roughly 50\nmillion Columbus State Dalton State\nUniversity of Georgia's main University\nof North Georgia's main campus Georgia\nSouthern East Georgia College Georgia\nSouthwestern\nUGA College of Coastal Georgia Albany\nState University of West Georgia Georgia\nCollege and State University uh\nall of those at least that's just this\nyear\nSenator final question if I added that\nnumbers together that seems like it's\nmaybe north of four and a half billion\ndollars is that not about right\ntaking the public hope\nUSG that that's I haven't done those\nnumbers yet but that sounds like it\ncould be fair\nrecognize senator from the 46.\nthank you Mr President will the chairman\nyield yes sir you don't mind it's gonna\nbe the last one for the University of\nGeorgia here in the universities system\nuh I've been hearing from my people back\nhome and I'm still an advocate that I\nmean y'all better not be messing with\nKirby Smart's money here I heard you\nmention him but I think our University\nsystem provides about the best\neducational opportunities in the country\nand yes sir with hope I know we're the\nEnvy of everybody I want to make sure\nwe're not\nunnecessarily harming\nour our entire University system here I\nkeep hearing all these numbers of course\nI was crunching them all afternoon when\nthis is on our desk is\nsomewhere North of 60 million they're\nclaiming our Cuts but y'all keep saying\nwe got 3 billion in the teaching budget\nyou got 800 and something million in\nHope\nyou got this 500 million that got in\nreserves what kind of percentage are we\ncutting from them if you\nI hadn't added on there's one line in\nhere said there's nine billion dollars\nin education I think that has federal\nfunds too\nthis treasure we have in our state\nthree billion 885 the 504 carry forward\n66 million dollar reduction of all those\nMr chairman I have that being at 1.5\npercent\ndoes the house agree with this these\nCuts this is a conference committee\nreport Mr chairman so yes sir is by both\nChambers\nall right we thank you for your efforts\nMr President there are no more

of the\nconference committee report on HB 19 all\nthose in favor of adopting the\nconference committee report will vote\nyay opposed nay secretary unlock the\nmachine\nalmost perfect again I tell you what\nmy good friend from the mountains up\nthere on the passage of the of the\nmotion the A's r54 the Nays are one the\nmotion has prevailed\nand the Senate has adopted the\nconference could be reported on HB 19.\ncongratulations senator\nsenator from the 14th what purpose do\nyou rise well Mr President I'd like to\nmake a motion\nwhat's your motion Senator well seeing\nthat the Senate has accomplished its one\nconstitutional Duty for the session I\nmove Mr President\nthat this Senate stand adjourned sign a\ndie\nyour emotion is in order senator\nsenator from the 19th what purpose you\nrise Parliament or anchor Mr President\nwhat state's inquiry bingo\nstand at ease I'm going to talk to our\nleadership team real quick\nSenate come back to order\nthe Senate could come back to order\nthe center from the 14th has made a\nmotion to adjourn and as he or Sani die\nuh and as he uh pointed out we have\ncompleted our only constitutional\nobligation here tonight so this is a\ndebatable motion and uh recognize the\nsenator from the 14th speak to it\ndistinguished members of the Senate\nthere Comes A Time In The Life and the\nworking\nschedule\nof every chamber\nwhen it's simply time to go home\nand further to that if you're a member\nof the minority in this chamber and you\nwatch with fomo\nevery time a member of the majority gets\nto make a special motion or agree to\nthis or disagree to that you think when\ndo I get to play when is it finally my\nturn when you look at a bingo card\nprepared by the Twitter ID and you see\nthat there is a blank that is yet to be\nscratched off it is in these moments\ncolleagues\nwhen young and enterprising Senators\nmust stand forward and do before 5 30 PM\nwhat few members are willing to do and\nthat is to move that this body adjourns\nSani die and that's why I did it and I'm\nnot sorry I did it\nMr President I'm happy to heal the\nquestions on this special motion\nyou have no questions Senator thank you\nMr President I yield the well and I urge\nyour favorable consideration\nI I reckon I recognize I recognize the\nproteom centered from the 18th speak to\nthe measure\nwell thank you I guess Mr President I'm\nnot sure\nso I find myself perplexed we don't\nusually get this kind of motion but he\nis a freshman the center from the 14th\nand sometimes he speaks as if he knows\nof which he's saying\nand sometimes he speaks as if he\nunderstands what he's saying even when\nwe don't understand what he's saying\nbut I think there are merits to this\nmotion we have done the one\nconstitutional duty of this body\nand I think we need to give serious\nconsideration to the motion\nbut then I'm really conflicted because\nthat would require me to agree with the\nsenator from the 14th\nand that causes me great angst\nbut the one thing that we would really\nthe burning question of on everyone's\nmind of every distinguished member of\nthis body is\nhow would the senator from the 53rd vote\nhow would he vote no\nand the possibility of gaining the\nanswer to that question almost is\ndelicious enough to make me want to\nsupport this motion and ask that we\nhaven't voted on\nbut with that I know we have other\ndistinguished members and Leadership\nthat may want to speak to that\nso as others have said\nyou know sometimes my friends are for it\nand sometimes they're against it but I'm\nalways for my friends so that would be\nmy answer to you senator from the 14th\nwhatever that means\nand I suspect that's about as\nunderstandable as some of the things you\nhave said from this well during this\nSith session thank you I do yield the\nwell all right\nall right\n[Applause]\nMadam leader do you would you like to\nspeak\nis the motion brought forward by your\ncaucus\nyes it was thank you Mr
