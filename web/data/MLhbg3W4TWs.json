Please\nwelcome the dean of the chapel, Reverend\nDr. Nishelle Gertie.\n>> Good morning.\nGreetings to President Bert Jones, to\nall present senators, especially to\nSenator Davenport for sponsoring\nSpellman Day today. I am Reverend Dr.\nMichelle Gidri where and I bring you\ngreetings from Spellelman College where\nI serve as the dean of the chapel and\nI'm so grateful to bring today's devote\ndevotion which reads as follows.\nOn a Judean mountain side, the one who\nwas the living word momentarily paused\nhis ministry of healing to teach a\nswarming crowd who were desperate to\nunderstand the kingdom he came\nproclaiming, the kingdom he embodied and\nthe kingdom he lived and practiced even\nin that moment. For in sitting with the\npeople that day rather than sending them\naway, in teaching them rather than\nleaving them in their spiritual\ndarkness, and in healing them rather\nthan than leaving them to languish in\ntheir sickness. The one whose name was\nJesus signified the coming of a new\ncommunity that was inclusive,\ncompassionate, and that sought to make\nthe wounded whole. This was his sermon\non the mount recorded in the Gospel of\nMatthew chapters 5-7. And some of\nJesus's most compelling, timeless, and\nalso some of his least popular teachings\ncan be found here in this gathering that\npreceded his church as we know it. That\nwas simply too good to be confound by\nwalls and antiquated norms of who\nbelonged and didn't. These were hungry\nand tired people. And in seeing their\ninherent value, Jesus taught them not to\njust follow him, but how to be like him.\nBlessed are the merciful, he taught\nthem, for they will receive mercy.\nBlessed are the pure in heart, he taught\nthem, for they will see God. Blessed are\nthe peacemakers, he taught them, for\nthey will be called God's children.\nAnd when you give charity, he taught\nthem. And when you pray, don't be\nhypocritical and do it for attention and\nacclaim. Do it in secret. And God who\nsees in secret will reward you openly.\nHe begs of us today, even from that very\nmountain side. Please do not be people\nwho are more concerned with your walls\nthan you are with extending welcome, who\nare more committed to your categories\nthan extending care, and who are more\nconcerned with exclusivity rather than\naccess. Please don't be so committed to\nyour own convenience that you can't stop\nto pour a little bit of what you have\ninto someone who is in dire need. And\nwhen you pray, he taught them, don't\nthrow up empty words to God. You don't\nneed to be loud. You don't need to be\nloquacious for God already knows what\nyou need before you even ask. And then\nJesus prayed for those people. The very\nprayer that I pray for you today. Let us\npray.\nDear God in heaven, hallowed be your\nname. Your kingdom come. Your will be\ndone on earth as it is in heaven.\nGive us this day our daily bread. And\nforgive us our trespasses as we forgive\nthose who trespass against us.\nLead us not into temptation, but deliver\nus from evil. For thine is the kingdom,\nthe power, and the glory forever and\never. Amen.\n>> Amen.\nThank you.\nif I can have everyone's attention. Uh\nit's always nice to have our elected\nofficials, our congressional leaders\nfrom around the state. And uh if I can\nget everybody's attention,\neverybody's attention.\nWe'd like to give all our congressmen\nand women the opportunity to address\nthis body and something we always take a\nlot of pride in and very happy and proud\nto have uh Congressman Rich McCormack\nhere today. He is in his second term as\nuh our congressman. hails from\nAlpharetta, Roswell area and uh he\nrepresents a a good portion of uh this\nthis fine state. He's done an\noutstanding job while serving in\nCongress. He he is a a medical doctor by\ntrade, proud graduate of Morehouse\nSchool of Medicine and former military\num military uh seal, right? Navy Seal.\n>> Marine pilot\n>> Marine Marine. I'm sorry. I'm gonna get\nhit now. I'm sorry. All right. A former\nMarine, just like the dean of uh of our\nfine chamber here, but uh Congressman\nMcCorm has is, like I said, has done a\ngreat job. He represents our state very\nwell. We're happy to have him here\ntoday, and y'all please give him a warm\nSenate welcome. Thank\nit. Is an honor to be here with you\ntoday. Thanks for uh participating. Uh,\none of the few things that I have hope\nin right now and and I guess there's a\nlot of things I could have hope in and\nthere are still commonalities amongst\nus. Sometimes it's the Marine Corps and\nthat transcends politics. I promise you.\nYou just want to know somebody's on your\nside, which is the bigger part of\npolitics in my opinion. We have plenty\nthat divides us right now. But if you\nlook at a guy like myself and you may\njudge me just by what I look like, and I\nget that. We do that to each other all\nthe time. But you probably didn't know I\nwas an associate professor at Morehouse\nSpellelman Clark Atlanta and Morris\nBrown at one time went to Morehouse\nSchool of Medicine and after four years\nwas elected student body president by my\npeers\nand my peers were about 60% female, 80%\nblack and about 95% liberal.\nSo how does a white male conservative\nget elected at that kind of school?\nbecause of our commonalities.\nWhen I give the uh commencement keynote\nspeech this year, you won't hear a\npolitical thing that comes out of my\nmouth because politics\ndoesn't really solve problems. Now, we\nthe people can solve a lot of problems,\nbut when you make any item political, it\nbecomes unsolvable.\nWhat do I mean by that? Tell me how\npoliticians have been the great solution\nto racism.\nYou can't because we're not going to\nsolve that. We're also not going to\nsolve education.\nWe cannot replace communities, churches,\nparents, families, and relationships.\nYou can't break down the barriers by\nmaking a law.\nYou break down barriers by having meals\ntogether, by praying together, by\ngetting to know each other. Because\nusually when you vilify somebody, it's\ncuz you don't know them very well. And\nquite frankly, the things that divide\nyou, whether it's inside your party or\ncollectively between two parties, those\nthings will never be passed into law.\nOnly those things that we agree on will\nbe passed. And that's the magic of our\ngovernment, that limited government that\nwe're supposed to have. Sometimes it's\nbest when you don't pass laws because\nsome of the worst things we have that\nhave affected our communities have been\nthe laws we passed with the unintended\nconsequences.\nI think the best thing we can do is get\nthe government out of the way of\nprogress.\nDepoliticize our problems so we can\nactually deal with them because it's not\nus against them.\nIt's us against evil, against prejudice,\nagainst the common foes that have been\nset before us by the great foe. And so I\nhope when you guys legislate and you\ndebate, realize that you can grandstand,\nyou can get a lot of publicity, you\ncould raise a lot of money, but only the\nthings that unite us are going to get\npassed.\nNow, you can really try to change\npeople's mind, and there's some people\nthat are swayable. A lot of people are\non the extremes. But can I give a piece\nof advice to anybody who maybe hasn't\nmade up their mind in life, who's still\nswayable or young enough that they\nhaven't made up their mind on what they\nbelieve is true. If you want to have\ninfluence\ninstead of trying to win an argument,\nwin a friend.\nAnybody who gets on on the internet\nknows that you don't see minds changed\nbecause of somebody's great and eloquent\nargument on the internet. It doesn't\nhappen. The more I try to convince you\nyou're wrong, the less you'll believe\nme. But if I can convince you that I\nlove you, which isn't a one-time\ninvestment, it's a multiple endeavor.\nIf I can convince you that I love you,\nyou might just believe what I have to\nsay next. And that's real influence. And\nwith that, that's not just advice.\nThat's just my experience.\nI love you. I want you guys to keep on\nrepresenting us the way you do because\nthis is where the real politics is. The\nmost representative government we have\nand anything I can do to push power down\nto you guys is going to be better off\nfor our state and for our great nation.\nGod bless you and seidelis.\n>> All right.\nIt is always nice to have uh the our\nphysicians that come down here and\nvolunteer their time\nand uh to the capital and all the people\nhere. And I u am glad to have uh the\northopedic orth orthopedic we're here\ntoday. Uh and to introduce our wonderful\nguest I will call on the senator from\nthe 38th to introduce.\n>> Thank you Mr. President. Good morning\ncolleagues. I am honored to welcome back\nto the chamber Dr. John Gleason who is\nan orthopedic surgeon with Resurgence\nOrthopedics.\nand he told me to keep this short and\nsweet. So, I'm just going to share that\nhe has 30 years of experience and 25 of\nthose 30 years he served with the gentle\nlady from the 32nd. So, I think we\nshould all hold that against him uh\nrather uh outside of anything. So, very\nhonored to welcome Dr. John Gleason back\nto the chamber.\n>> All right.\nAll right.\n>> Thank y'all. It's good to look out there\nand see a lot of friends uh and no\nadversaries. So, it's it's fun to be\nhere. Uh thank y'all for the work you do\nfor the citizens of Georgia and for\ntheir health. And good luck. You have 31\nmore days to do it.\n>> All right. Good job. Good job.\nAll right, if we could have everyone's\nattention, we have some very special\nguests here today. Every year we always\nis very proud and honored to have the\nladies of Spellelman College come and\nand be recognized for all the wonderful\nwork that they do that that historic\nthat they do at that historical\ninstitution. And u we once again have a\ngood group here behind us. Young lady\ngetting ready to graduate from theater.\nI'm I'm I got a good feeling we're\nprobably going to hear from her uh in a\nsecond here. But uh Secretary read the\nresolution then we'll ask Senator from\nthe 17th to introduce\n>> Senate Resolution 591 by Senator\nDavenport of the 17th. A resolution\nrecognizing Spellman Day at the Georgia\nState Capital and for other purposes.\nWhereas Spellelman College founded in\n1881 in Atlanta, Georgia is a nationally\nacclaimed private liberal arts college\nfor women and the oldest historically\nblack college for women in the United\nStates. And whereas Spellelman College\nenrolls approximately 2500 students,\noffers 34 academic majors and 39 minors,\nand reports that 86% of full-time\nfaculty hold doctoral degrees or the\nterminal degree in their field. And\nwhereas Spellelman College reports a 76%\nsix-year graduation rate, significantly\nexceeding the national average, whereas\nSpellelman College has produced a global\nnetwork of more than 20,000 alumni\nworldwide. Now therefore, be it resolved\nby the Senate that the members of this\nbody recognize Spellelman Day at the\nGeorgia State Capital and commend\nSpellelman College for its enduring\nlegacy of academic excellence,\nleadership, development, and service to\nthe state of Georgia, the nation, and\nthe world. Mr. President, that completes\nthe order.\n>> I recognize a senator from Oh, I'm\nsorry. That's right.\n>> Would\nis there objection to adoption\nresolution? Chair hears none and the\nresolution is adopted.\nRecognize a senator from the 17th.\n>> Thank you, Mr. President, colleagues,\nand guests. I am honored to recognize my\nalma mada Spellelman College. It's\nSpellelman Day at the Capitol.\nSpellelman College was founded in 1881\nand since that time has become a global\nleader in the education of women of\nAfrican descent and is the oldest\nhistorically black college for women in\nthe United States. Spellelman is\naccredited by the Southern Association\nof Colleges and School Commissions on\nColleges and we are proud members of the\nAtlanta University Center Consortium.\nToday, Spellelman enrolls approximately\n2500 students from 43 states and 10\nforeign countries. Spellelman empowers\nwomen to engage the many cultures of the\nworld and inspires a commitment to\npositive social change through service.\nWe are dedicated to academic excellence\nin liberal arts and sciences.

Thank you for the\nopportunity to be here with you today.\nWe are grateful for your leadership and\nfor the Senate's continued support of\nhigher education across the state of\nGeorgia.\nI am delighted to share Spellelman Day\nat the Capitol with members of the\nNational Alumni Association of\nSpellelman College Incorporated, the\nGeorgia chapters along with our\nstudents, our faculty, and our staff.\nThank you for recognizing Spellelman\nCollege today. Spellelman College plays\na critical role in Georgia's economic\nvitality, workforce development, and\nleadership pipeline. Our graduates live,\nwork, and lead across the state,\nparticularly in metro Atlanta,\ncontributing to key sectors including\nhealth care, education, public service,\ntechnology, and entrepreneurship.\nSpellelman's mission is especially\nrelevant today in its rapidly changing\neconomy. We prepare students to think\ncritically, work across disciplines,\nadapt to change, and lead with purpose\nand those qualities that serve Georgia's\nemployers, communities, and public\ninstitutions so well. We are proud of\nSpellelman's continued academic\nexcellence. Spellelman is ranked number\none H.B.CU CU for 19 consecutive years.\nRanked number two nationally for social\nmobility, number seven for learning\ncommunities, and number 37 among all\nnational liberal arts colleges by US\nNews and World Report. But most\nrecently, Newsweek named Spellelman the\nnumber one best college for women in the\nnation.\n>> These outcomes are made possible in part\nthrough Georgia's commitment to student\naccess and affordability. We are deeply\ngrateful for HOPE and other state\nfinancial aid programs, including those\nthat support students attending private\ncolleges. This support is critical for\nSpellelman students and their families\nand helps ensure talented Georgians can\npursue higher education here at home.\nWe are also grateful for recent\nphilanthropic investments, including a\n$16.5 million gift from the Arthur Blank\nFamily Foundation here in Atlanta, and a\n38 million unrestricted gift from the\nMackenzie Scott family, which directly\nsupports student completion, academic\nexcellence, and campus modernization,\nadvancing Spellelman's strategic\npriorities, and strengthening our\nlong-term impact. Our students continue\nto excel, earning nationally competitive\nscholarships, engaging in meaningful\ncivil service, expanding literacy\nthrough programs like Spell Reads, and\nstrengthening local economies through\ninitiatives such as the Center for Black\nEntrepreneurship. I am proud to lead\nSpellman during this important moment\nfor higher education. The world is\nchanging, but the need for\nwell-prepared, thoughtful, and capable\nleaders has never been greater. Thank\nyou for celebrating Spellelman College\nDay at the Capitol and thank you for\nyour continued partnership and support\nfor Spellelman College and the students\nwe so humbly serve.

So all right\nthank you ladies with ladies with\nspelling. Let's give them a round of\napplause again.\nWe're going to move on to points of\npersonal privilege\njust because we got started a little\nlate and things have run a little late.\nSo, we're going to go ahead and go right\nto it. I recognize senator from the 47th\nfor a point of personal privilege.\nThank you, Mr. President. I'd like for\nmy uh friends from from Jackson County.\nI've got a great group of uh Jackson\nCounty Youth Leadership Group to all\nstand up for me. We want to honor your\nvisit to the capitol. Said the the uh\nJackson County is a little unique in\nthat there are th three school\ndistricts, but we quickly added the\nfourth one last year. So there actually\nfour school districts in Jackson County.\nThree of them are represented here with\nthe Jackson County youth leaders. My\ncolleague from the 50th and I want to\nwelcome you to the Senate and we'd like\nto give you a big round of applause. So\ngreat to have you all here this morning.\nrecognize the senator from the fourth.\n>> Thank you, Mr. President.\nMany of y'all know the term rolling\nthunder, right? Oh yeah, we all know\nthat term. But today at the capitol is\ncalled strolling thunder thunder, excuse\nme, strolling thunder. So let me tell\nyou a little bit about that. Um, you may\nhave noticed a buzz of activity around\nthe capital today of the gold dome\ntoday. Our friends at the Georgia Early\nEducation Alliance for Ready Students,\ncommonly referred to as Gears, are\nhaving their annual event, Strolling\nThunder, where young children, birth to\nfive, and their families join us at the\ncapital. I've already seen many children\nout there already this morning. Early\nchildhood is an incredible window of\nopportunity where brains are developing\nmore rapidly than at any other point.\nOur youngest children are our future,\nand we know that. Please say hello to\nany t any of our tiny constituents if\nyou see them in the halls and join gears\nand their families across the street\nlater on today at the freight depot for\nlunch. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield\nwell.\nRecognize senator from the 41st.\nGood morning, colleagues. This is really\nfor my son who has gone back to the\noffice to watch on TV because this place\nwas a little more hectic than a\n5-year-old could handle. But I want to\nwish Reese a happy fifth birthday,\nso honored.\nI thank you all to this body. You all\nhave welcomed him with such\ngraciousness. But I'm deeply honored to\nbe able to be his mom. So many of you\nall know he came into our lives when he\nwas just two years old um in a really\nsudden moment and we have gotten to love\nhim and care for him with so much\npassion. So um happy birthday Ree. We\nlove you and I'll see you soon.\n>> Thank you, Senator. And wish your son a\nvery happy birthday. It's hard to\nbelieve he's already five.\nAll right. We're going to center from\n33rd.\n>> Thank you, Mr. President, my fellow\nsenators, colleagues, friends, and\ny'all.\nUh, I am pleased to share with you that\nthe senator from the 48th and I will be\nserving as the bipartisan co-chairs of\nthe newly created Senate India Caucus.\nThe Senate India Caucus is a bipartisan\ncoalition that promotes a relationship\nbetween India and the state of Georgia\nbased on mutual trust and respect to\nincrease close collaboration across a\nbroad spectrum of strategic interest\nsuch as promoting democracy, economic\ndevelopment, and cultural partnership\nalong with friendship. You will today\nreceive an email inviting you to join\nour caucus. We hope you will reciprocate\nby answering yes. Thank you very much.\nAnd Mr. President, I yield. Well,\nthank you, Senator. Recognize Senator\nfrom the third.\nThank you, Mr. President. colleagues. Um\nyou'll notice on your desk you have an\ninvitation from the Brunswick Golden\nIsles Chamber of Commerce for their\nstate leadership appreciation dinner.\nIt's on February the 17th about 3 weeks\naway. The reason I'm giving you this as\nearly as I am is to give you a chance to\nRSVP so that we can figure out how much\nshrimp we need to bring. And I will\nremind you of this a little closer to\nthe date, but put it on your calendars.\nFebruary 17th at the depot 5:00\nuh tons of wild Georgia shrimp. Thank\nyou.\nAll right, Senator, we'll have to mark\nour calendars. Always a good day.\nRecognize the senator from the 28th.\nSenator, you want to speak from there?\nThe floor is yours.\nI think so. Thank you.\n>> Okay.\n>> Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you very\nmuch.\nYesterday\nI was driving home from here\nand heard on the radio about what was\nhappening in my neighborhood\njust a few blocks from my house.\nWe witnessed another instance\nof Donald Trump's egregious attempts to\ncontrol the narrative on that 2020\nelection by sending the FBI\nto God's country to forcibly take\nevidence from the Fulton County Election\nOffice. He once again proved\nthat he will stop at nothing to get what\nhe wants. No matter how shocking, no\nmatter how dangerous, no matter how\nunlawful.\nEverybody knows this is nonsense.\nWe are four years past the 2020\nelection. That election was counted,\nrecounted,\naudited, reviewed by the courts, and the\nlist goes on.\nThere was no rigging. There were no fake\nvotes. There was no secret stash hiding\nin a the county office.\nIs there even one person in the capital\ntoday who still believes that the 2020\nelection was rigged?\nSo, let's not be let's be honest about\nwhat's going on and what we're watching\nand what we're hearing on the radio.\nWhen state officials follow the law and\nrefuse to hand over protected voter\ndata, suddenly we see the federal\ngovernment intervening. When they don't\nget what they want, they come and they\ntake it. That should worry everybody in\nthis building. The FBI exists to keep\npeople safe, to stop violent crime, to\nstop terrorism, to protect the public.\nIt is not supposed to be the president's\npersonal play thing, using federal law\nenforcement to chase political\ngrievances of 2020.\nThis is wrong. It tells voters that the\nrules only matter when they're\nconvenient.\nIf the federal government wants\nsomething, there's a process.\nThey should think they're entitled to\nit, the real process, and not what they\ncome up with. There's a court.\nWhat there should be\nshould not be is intimidation\ndressed up as enforcement.\nActions like this undermine trust,\nintimidate election workers, and pull\nGeorgia backwards. We should be\ngoverning in 2026, not replaying 2020\nlike it never ended. This body should\nreject chaos, reject political theater,\nand reject using our law enforcement\nas a personal tool, as a weapon.\nGeorgia has been a national model for\nelection integrity.\nWe do not need federal\nraids to protect our democracy. We need\nleaders with a moral clarity to defend\nit. History teaches us that democracy\ndoes not vanish overnight.\nIt is not dismantled slowly, legally,\nand often with\napplause from their those who believe\nthat it will benefit them.\nUh ladies and gentlemen, we must not\nbecome\nthat casualty.\nIt is too late to reverse democracy.\nIt's time to move forward. So, Georgia,\nlet's move forward and not backwards.\nThank you.\nI\nrecognize Senator from the 38th for a\npoint of personal privilege.\nThe man in the brand new three-piece\nsuit. Senator, that didn't that suit\ndidn't come off the rack now. I know\nthat. You had to get measured for that.\nHuh?\nThank you, Mr. President. We're going to\nget you one. Uh colleagues, uh\nyesterday, Senate District 38, my\ndistrict, became ground zero for the\nlatest assault on American democracy. An\nassault that did not begin yesterday,\nbut one that began to unfold in 2020.\nColleagues, no matter what you saw on\nthe news, I want to share something with\nyou. I was there. And here's what I know\nto be true. The federal government\nseized 2020 Fulton County election\nballots, not 2024,\nbecause that was an election that Donald\nTrump already won in Georgia.\nThey weren't securing an election. They\nwere revisiting the past to control the\nfuture. We still don't know where these\nballots were taken.\nAnd even more disturbing, we don't know\nhow this information will be used. What\nwe do know without dispute is that this\naction was taken without the consent or\nknowledge of Georgia election officials.\nSecrecy is not law enforcement. Secrecy\nis intimidation.\nI have deep respect for the debates in\nthis chamber, but yesterday we were\nreminded to remember that we are Georgia\nstate senators.\nAnd I must share that this is exactly\nwhy we speak about what happens across\nthis nation. This is why this chamber\nand our voices matter because yesterday\nis what happens when power goes\nunchecked and silence becomes\npermission. This is not abstract. This\nis not theoretical. This happened in my\ndistrict, seven minutes from my home, in\nyour backyard, in the state of Georgia.\nThese are my constituents. These are\nGeorgia voters, and they are the ones\nthat are being targeted.\nYesterday, I heard claims that the\nminority caucus does not respect due\nprocess. Well, there is nothing more\ndisrespectful to due process than\nseasoned ballots in the dark. Let me be\nclear. Yesterday was not about a sore\nloser. This isn't about 2020. It's about\ncontrolling 2026.\nThis is about a president who knows that\nhis grip on power is slipping and who is\nwilling to weaponize the federal\ngovernment to hold on to it. We have\nwatched this unfold across the country.\nAnd now it is here in the state of\nGeorgia.\nThis should concern every Georgian, not\njust those here in metro Atlanta, white,\nblack, Democrat, Republican,\nindependent, urban, and rural alike. I\nam sounding the alarm because democracy\ndoes not collapse all at once. It\nerodess when good people are told to\nlook away. If ballots can be seized\nwithout transparency, if election\nworkers can be sidelined without\nconsent, if fear replaces trust, then\nthe question is no longer who wins\nelections, but whether elections still\nbelong to the people. This chamber must\nchoose, our state must choose, this\ncountry must choose. Silence or the\nconstitution, fear or freedom, power or\nprinciple?\nHistory is watching what we do next. I\nfor one refuse to be silent while\ndemocracy is dragged away from the\npeople it belongs to. And with that, Mr.\nPresident, I yield the well.\nRecognize the senator from the fifth for\npoint of personal privilege.\nYesterday, the FBI raided the Fulton\nCounty Election Board. There were once\nagain searching for materials related to\n2020 presidential election. An election\nthat has been audited, litigated,\nreviewed, reaffirmed, and yet years\nlater fairy tales and conspiracy\ntheories refused to loosen their grips.\nThese fantasies have already done real\ndamage.\nThey have poisoned trust,\nfractured communities, and now they\nthreaten something even bigger.\nConfidence in 2026 election and in our\nability to govern ourself.\nOur people deserve more and they and\nthey deserve better.\nThis year mark the 250th anniversary\nof American\nfounding.\nI wasn't born into it like so many here.\nAnd choosing America mean choosing the\nideas it was built on. A government of\nthe people by the people\nproviding that free citizen can govern\nthemsel.\nWe do not need a king who treat law\nenforcement like personal errand boys\nchasing imaginary nightmares dreamed up\nto clinch to power.\nToday we must condemn this. We must\nstand up clearly and courageously\nfor the values America was founded upon.\nThank you. I\nrecognize center from the seventh.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nI rise to talk about what happened\nyesterday. Federal agents executed a\nsearch warrant at Fulton County's\nelection facility and took records and\nballots from the 2020 election. And I\nwant to begin with what should be\nobvious, but apparently still needs to\nbe said out loud in 2026.\nThis is not about 2020. This is about\n2026. This is about who controls what\ncomes next. Because nearly six years\nafter Georgia voters made their choice,\nsome people are still trying to keep the\nstate trapped in a permanent argument\nabout the last election so they can\njustify rewriting the rules for the next\none. This is not random. This is not\nisolated. This is not just one more\nheadline. It is part of a larger scheme,\nan intentional campaign to manufacture\ndoubt, flood the zone, and then claim\nthat the only solution is takeover. They\nwant Georgians exhausted. They want\nvoters confused, and they want the\npublic so overwhelmed that people stop\nasking the most important question of\nall. Who benefits from keeping Georgia\nin chaos? Because when you can't win an\nelection fair and square, you try to\ncontrol who runs it. When you can't\npersuade voters, you try to control the\nprocess. And when you can't accept the\ntruth, you try to bury it under noise.\nAnd that noise has a purpose. It's the\nsame play every time. Step one, call it\nan emergency. Step two, say the locals\ncan't be trusted. Step three, replace\nlocal control with political control.\nAnd if that sounds familiar, it's\nbecause we've watched versions of it\nunfold across this country where the\ngoal isn't security. The goal is power.\nThe goal is power. Now, let's talk about\nsomething that should alarm every\nGeorgian, no matter what party you\nbelong to. The US Department of Justice\nhas been suing for access to Georgia's\nunredacted statewide voter registration\ndata. Data that includes sensitive\npersonal information, including your\ndriver's license numbers, impartial\nsocial security numbers. This is not a\nsmall request. This is not routine. It\nis not normal, and it is not harmless.\nThat is a demand for an enormous amount\nof personal data. Information that could\nexpose Georgians to risk if misused or\nmishandled and information Georgia law\nis designed to protect. So pair that\nwith what happened in Fulton County and\nthe picture becomes clear. This is about\ninformation. It is about leverage. It's\nabout control. Because once you convince\npeople the system can't be trusted, you\ncan justify almost every anything.\ntaking authority away from local\ncommunities, centralizing control,\nchanging rules in the name of\nconfidence, and setting the stage to\ninterfere with elections that haven't\neven happened yet. And let me say this\npart in plain English. Georgia is a\nswing state. Georgia is ground zero and\nGeorgia will be targeted. We're not\nguessing anymore. We're watching it\nhappen in real time. And the question is\nwhether we are going to pretend it's\nnormal or whether we are going to name\nit for what it is. This is the politics\nof pretext. the politics of manufactured\ndoubt. The politics will accept\nelections only when we win them. And\nwhile they are trying to keep Georgia\nlocked in a never- ending fight about\n2020, real people are living in 2026.\nFamilies are paying more and getting\nless. Hospitals are closing. Rent is\nrising. Insurance premiums are rising.\nWages are not. And that contrast matters\nbecause it tells you what this is really\nabout. When leaders have nothing to\noffer on affordability, nothing to offer\non healthcare, nothing to offer on\nstability, they reach for the oldest\ntrick in politics, keep people afraid,\nkeep people angry, and keep the\nspotlight on anything except the bills\npiling up on the kitchen table. So\nhere's my message today. We will not let\nthe future of Georgia elections be\ndecided by people who are still trying\nto relitigate the last one. We will not\nlet Fulton County be turned into a\npermanent scapegoat so as so someone\nelse can justify a takeover. We will not\nlet confidence become a code word for\ncontrol. And we will say clearly over\nand over until nobody can pretend they\ndo not understand this is not about\n2020. This is about 2026.\nThank you.\n>> Recognize the senator from the 29th.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nUm, after our conversation yesterday,\nI went back and and looked at some of\nthe comments that were made.\nAnd the one that struck me the most was\nwas made by my fellow Police Academy\ngrad\nwho said that rhetoric\nand the misidentification of the men and\nwomen that wear the badge is dangerous\nbecause they become targets.\nAnd I guess a recent example would be\n9:30 this morning when a Warner Robbins\npolice officer responded to a 911 call\nof domestic violence.\nAnd as he was exiting his vehicle, he\nwas shot five times.\nOther officers responded.\nThe bleeding was stopped. Some of the\nrounds went under his vest, nicked some\nvital organs,\ngot him stabilized. He's been\ntransferred to Mon\nfor for greater attention and care.\nThe suspect\nbarricaded himself in his house.\nOnce other law enforcement resources\nwere brought to bear, he surrendered.\nHe'll be taken to the Warren Robbins\nPolice Department.\nHe will be mirandized.\nAnd if you don't know what that means,\nhe'll be read his rights under the\nMiranda decision to make sure he doesn't\nincriminate himself. He'll be made aware\nof all of his constitutional rights. If\nhe's hungry, he'll be fed. If he's\nthirsty, he'll be given something to\ndrink. He'll be provided with legal\ncounsel, and the wills of due process\nwill start.\nNow, that officer had no due process\nthis morning.\nHe responded to help somebody\nand somebody saw him as a threat,\nas a threat to what they wanted to do.\nAnd this is why the words we speak in\nthis chamber are important.\nAnd this is why\nthe late great comedian George Carlin\nsaid, \"When your ideology becomes your\nidentity,\nthen you no longer matter.\nThis officer mattered. What we say in\nthis chamber matters. And Mr. President,\nI would ask for a moment of silent\nsilence as we think about this officer,\nhis family, his loved ones, and his\nfellow officers\nas he's as he fights for his life.\n>> The senator has requested a moment of\nsilence. Let's please stand and give him\nthat moment. And all our prayers go out\nto that family there in Hson County.\n>> Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the\nwell. Thank you, Senator. Bringing on a\nsenator from the 44th for a point of\npersonal privilege.\nThank you, Mr. President. Today,\nGeorgians woke up to a stunning and\ndisturbing headline. The FBI rating of\nFulton County Elections Facility seeking\nballots from the 2020 election. An\nelection that was decided, audited,\nrecounted, litigated, and certified more\nthan five years ago.\nThis is not normal.\nThis is a man and a political party\ntrapped in a fever dream.\nThis is a political party terrified of\ntelling one man the truth. I really\nshould not have to repeat this truth,\nbut for the sake of history,\nJoe Biden won the 2020 election. Donald\nTrump lost. Here in Georgia, we counted\nthe ballots three times. We conducted a\nfull hand recount. Courts at every level\nhere and around the country rejected\nclaims of fraud. Republican- elected\nofficials, including our Governor Kemp\nand Secretary Raffensburgger, certified\nthe results, and that should have been\nthe end of it. But here we are again\nwith new chapters to this tired, old,\ndesperate story.\nIt disturbed me that\nRepublicans in this chamber could not\nsummon the courage to stand up to Donald\nTrump after the murder of Alex Prey.\nBut now,\ncan we not bring ourselves to say aloud\nwhat every American already knows? That\nDonald Trump lost the 2020 election.\nBut of course, it's more than that. He\nmay have lost his mind.\nThis endless indulgence of Trump's\nfantasy is tearing our country apart and\nour democracy apart.\nIt fments violence against election\nworkers and politicians with all too\nreal consequences. I know I was not the\nonly elected official in Georgia who had\nto have security after Rudy Giuliani's\ntraveling circus was given a hearing by\nthis body.\nAs Donald Trump tried to overturn the\n2020 election, Ruby Freeman, Sheay Moss,\nGovernor Kemp, Secretary Raffensburgger,\nformer Lieutenant Governor Duncan, they\nall had it far worse.\nAnd I am astonished\nthat we are reliving that sorry episode,\nthat stain on this body, on this state\nsenate, that that was permitted here in\nthis capital.\nThe message that we're sending voters\nis that truth is optional, facts are\npartisan, and elections are only\nlegitimate when Republicans win.\nThe people of Georgia were ready to move\non from 2020 in January of 2021. They\nwant better schools, affordable health\ncare and housing, safe communities, and\neconomic opportunity.\nInstead, they're watching as their state\ngovernment is dragged backwards into\nconspiracy theories and grievance\npolitics.\nThe number of swing voters in Georgia\nthat care about Fulton County ballots\nfrom 2020 is zero.\nWhat they care about is whether their\nleaders can govern responsibly in 2026\nand 2027.\nAnd I'm sorry to repeat what many people\nare thinking, but the answer from\ntoday's Republican party to that\nquestion increasingly appears to be no.\nBecause a party that cannot front\nreality cannot govern.\nRepublicans should really be ashamed\nthat Georgia has become ground zero for\nthis national spectacle of denial.\nOnce upon a time, not so long ago, in\nfact, when I was first elected in 2010,\nthe parties differed over taxes,\nthe and the size and scope of\ngovernment,\nabortion maybe, and those were serious\nconsequential debates among people who\nloved their country.\nBut what we're witnessing right now,\nthis is not the country or the\ngovernment that I grew up with.\nToday, federal law enforcement resources\nare being consumed to chase down\nconspiracies that were debunked years\nago. The Secretary of State is being\npressured to violate the law.\nRepublicans should be ashamed, and I am\nsure that many are, that our democracy\nis being treated like a toy to soothe\none man's wounded pride.\nColleagues, we make progress for\nGeorgians\nand this great state when we work\ntogether on things that actually affect\ntheir lives. Let's quit the repetitive\nnonsense on 2020 and get to work.\nThank you, Mr. President. I yield the\nwell.\nWe're going to have a senator from the\nninth.\n>> Okay. First, uh, thank you, Mr.\nPresident. First, I want to recognize\nbefore I get off on another topic, uh,\nthey were just in the chamber. It was\nBuilding Babies Gwynette. They are here\nto visit us today. And Gwynette Building\nBabies is a community that collaborates\nto focus on ensuring that our children\nenter kindergarten ready to learn and\nthrive. They're a group of businesses,\nvolunteers, and community nonprofits.\nUm, and they are asking for our support\nand asking for our support in the\nlegislature so they can continue their\nprogram. So, I'm going to pivot from\nthere um because I did want to recognize\nthem because they were guests here. And\nfirst of all, I want to say that I am\ntruly sorry, Senator from the 29th,\nabout the officer that lost his life. I\nmourn the death of any of our highly\ntrained local law enforcement.\nAnd I want you all to know that\nDemocrats stand behind our highly\ntrained, highly vetted local law\nenforcement not wearing masks. And\nthat's who we're talking about.\nSo I I came up here so we can make that\ndistinction\nbecause I'm unhappy with that narrative.\nAnd we've been very clear about who\nwe're talking about.\nWe're talking about\nmass\npoorly trained because they were trained\nto cut corners so they could get through\nthe process and get a get a badge to be\nICE.\nThey're the ones terrorizing our\ncommunities. That's what we're talking\nabout. Our local law enforcement and\nthey are servants and we understand\nfully that they are working to protect\nus and make our communities feel safe.\nICE is not making our communities feel\nsafe. So please, if you're going to\nquote us, I'm making sure today on the\nrecord you quote us properly. We're\ntalking about Trump administration,\nICE\nrunning around with badges and names and\nmasks and we don't even know who they\nare and they're not being held\naccountable for murder.\nThat is not what our local law\nenforcement does.\nI know personally our Gwynette County\npolice go through rigorous months of\ntraining about how to dis deescalate\nsituations.\nSituations that if they have to be in\nfront of a car,\nhow to deescalate that.\nNone of you have made the distinction\nthat maybe we've cut corners on how ICE\nis being trained and maybe some proper\nprocedures have not been fulfilled.\nSo, I'm going to say it again. I and my\nparty, I fully respect\nand thank\nour trained law enforcement\nthat give their lives every day to\nprotect our community. And with that,\nMr. President, I yield. Well,\n>> senators yielded. Recognize a senator\nfrom the 27th.\n>> Thank you, Mr. President.\nI want to remind everyone what happened\nyesterday as it relates to the actual\nfact pattern of law.\nAnd a warrant was issued\nby a magistrate judge\nbased on probable cause after evidence\nwas submitted.\nNot a Trump appointed judge, a\nmagistrate judge. That is the way that\nthe law enforcement process works in\nAmerica. But we have heard repeatedly\nthat everything was perfect with 2020.\nIn fact, I think we probably at this\npoint could trademark the most secure\nelection in American history. What\nqualifications we use to measure that, I\nhave no idea. But let's go back to what\nactually happened in 2020 if we're going\nto have the conversation. Dropboxes\ninvented out of thin air, nowhere in\nGeorgia law. Mobile voting units moving\nthrough Fulton County to 80% Democrat\nprecincts. 81% Democrat precincts to be\nprecise. Nowhere envisioned in Georgia\nlaw.\n6.8 million absentee ballot request\nforms with a first class stamp sent to\nevery registered voter in the state of\nGeorgia. Nowhere envisioned in Georgia\nlaw.\nIf you count the same ballots three\ntimes, in theory you should get numbers\nthat match. But that didn't happen\neither. Let's talk about the recount\nthat happened.\n3,930\ndouble scan ballots in Fulton County\nalone.\nThousands of those have been confirmed\nby the state election board. Governor\nKemp actually raised the concerns of the\nMona Mona report and we now know that\nthere were double scanned ballots. But\neven after the ballots were double\nscanned at Fulton County, did the\nnumbers match on the second recount?\nNope. They were still off by 850\nballots,\nnot one person here can answer the\nquestion of how that happened. And that\nis a legitimate question. We know that\nballot images were deleted. We know that\ntest ballots were included in the\nrecount process and we have that\nconfirmed. But I want to take just a\nminute and talk about what the Democrats\ndid in response to legitimate questions\nover the 2020 election. A former\nconstituent of mine, Derek Somerville,\nformer FBI agent, ran data analysis\nalong with another gentleman named Mark\nDavis. And remember the 6.8 million\nabsentee ballot request forms that were\nsent out? They had a first class stamp.\nSo that means if you filed the national\nchange of address form, that was\nautomatically forwarded to your new\naddress. And they identified reasonable\ncause to question the validity of 39,141\nof those ballots that were cast.\nThey knew that 160 people had been\nregistered to vote from a single UPS\nstore. 2,138\npeople had been registered to vote from\none church in Fulton County. 1,391\nhad been registered to vote from a\nshuttered 1,000qt building in Fulton\nCounty. Unless you lest you think Fulton\nCounty has cleaned up their voter roles,\ntoday thousands of people are registered\nto vote in Fulton County at UPS stores,\nstorage units, pack mails, homeless\nshelters that haven't been open for over\n5 years. The Fulton County voter roles\nhave been and continue to be a mess. But\nwhen Derek Somerville and Mark Davis\nfollowed the law and filed objections to\nthose voters, what did the Democrats do?\nWell, Stacy Abrams sued him in federal\ncourt\nand they won. Not Stacy Abrams, but\nSomerville and Davis won. Judge Jones,\nnot a Republican judge, ruled in their\nfavor. What have we learned since then\nabout those 39,000 voters? 12,000 of\nthem have been removed from the voter\nroles because Somerville and Davis were\ncorrect that they no were no longer\neligible to vote. 9,500\nhave updated their address to a new\naddress outside of Fulton County,\nproving once again that Somerville and\nDavis were correct and those people were\nineligible to vote. Ultimately, 84%\nof the votes that of the eligibility\nthat Somerville and Davis challenged\nwere proven to have been invalid voters\nin the 2020 election. So, let's stop\nthis charade of the most perfect, most\nsecure election in history. But more\nimportantly, and I would agree with my\ncolleagues on this, let's look forward\nto the future elections, and it's darn\nnear past time for Fulton County to\nclean up their voter roles.\nSenator's yielded recognized Senator\nfrom the 35th. You wish to speak at the\nwell.\n>> Yes.\n>> Got to go around. Senator,\n>> I would pick at you, but you got a\nserious look on your face. So, you might\nbe you might have a serious conversation\nright now.\nAll right.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nTrust in our government is at an\nall-time low.\nTrust in our institutions at an all-time\nlow.\nThe cost of everything is all all-time\nhigh.\nKing Jesus is still on the throne.\nrelease the Epstein files. I yield the\nwell.\nRecognize Senator from the 37th\nMr. President, ladies and gentlemen, the\nSenate, I rise today in a spirit of\nsomber\nhopefulness.\nI'm somber today for a different topic\nthan has been talked about, but one that\nhas been plaguing us for decades and\nones that we can no longer ignore.\nThe epidemic I'm talking about is the\nepidemic of fatherlessness in our\nculture. The condition in which either\nfathers or in many cases mothers are not\nin the lives of their kids because our\ncurrent laws in Georgia give no\ndirection to the judiciary\nfor shared parenting.\nI bring this before you today,\ncolleagues, because Senate Bill 404,\nwhich is not before you today as a\nproposition, but it will be before the\nSenate uh shortly, raises this question\nof the powerful data we've seen from\nother states, we've seen from other\nnations of the power of shared\nparenting.\nThere's a recognition that in Georgia\nlast year, 46%\nof all children born across all\nsocioeconomic categories, 46%\nwere born out of wedlock.\nAnd with a divorce rate that approaches\n50%.\nI suggest to you friends,\nthe most important decision in the lives\nof many of our Georgia's children is the\ndecision of\nwho gets custody and how much custody\ndoes mom have and dad have. How much\ntime is mom and dad going to spend in\nthe lives of their children?\nI say this because the stakes are high.\nOn your desk, senators, is a is a chart\nthat I brought for you today that shows\nthe amount of time that children spend\nwith their non-custodial parent.\nIn fact, Georgia as a state among our 50\nstates is in the bottom five of the\namount of time children spend with their\nnon-custodial parents. The bottom five.\nThis affects moms as non-custodial\nparents and dads as non-custodial\nparents. But when you look at the\nstatistics here, you see states that\nhave gotten this right, that share as\nthe default condition 50/50 between mom\nand dad include Florida,\nKentucky,\nMassachusetts,\nMouri,\nArkansas, and others. In fact, what\nwe've seen in those states is is in\npassing shared parenting where the\ndefault condition in our courts is that\nthere's a 50/50 sharing between mom and\ndad in a custody hearing. And if judges\nin the best interest of the child decide\nby simple proponents of the evidence\nthat it ought to be something other than\nthat, they can certainly order that and\nthey will. This is not going to create a\ncircumstance where a bad parent is going\nto have an undue influence in a child's\nlife. But what shared parenting, Senate\nBill 404 does is it says for good\nparents, the default will be a 50/50\nshare.\nThe data is clear, friends. You look at\nthe research on this, 30% involvement in\na child's life for a non-custodial\nfather is defined as fatherlessness.\nIf so, that means if 30% of the time a\nkid spends with a parent is with dad, if\nif it's 30% or less, that's considered a\nfatherless child for academic research.\nWe recognize when that's the case, the\nthe the circumstances of crime and and\nall kinds of problems spike in the lives\nof kids.\nOur prison system is filled\nwith fatherless men and women, people\nwho weren't raised with dad in their\nhome. And again, equal parenting that\nsupports non-custodial moms and dads. We\nrecognize the impact of this. And I will\ntell you we are the bottom five states\namongst the bottom five states in the\nnation in terms of the times\nnon-custodial parents have with their\nkids and that is contributing to our\nepidemic. Friends, Senate Bill 404 uh\nwhich will be before this body shortly\nis supported by data. We saw the divorce\nrate in Kentucky decrease by 18% in the\nyears after passing their bill. We've\nseen domestic violence go down by 20%\nacross the states. In fact, even in\nSpain that they some of the provinces in\nSpain implemented this. Those that\nimplemented shared parenting, they saw\ndomestic violence go down 20% compared\nto those that did not. It's true in Ohio\nversus Kentucky. It's true across our\nstates. And friends, I would propose to\nyou today that if we care about our kids\nand we're trying to solve systemic\nproblems that have been plaguing our\nculture for decades,\nshared parenting is a critical part of\nthat solution. And that's why I raise to\nyou today these somber statistics,\nbut I raise them with hope that we, the\ngeneral assembly, can do something about\nthis and do something about this. We\nshall. With that, Mr. President, I yield\nthe well.\n>> Senator's yielded. Recognize the senator\nfrom the 34th for appointed personal\nprivilege.\n>> Of course not.\n>> Thank you, Mr. President.\nGood morning, colleagues.\nYesterday's raid on Fortune County's\nelections headquarters\nwas not an isolated incident.\nIt was the latest conspiracy\ntheory surrounding the 2020 elections.\nIt was a theory continued to roll the\nfoundation of our democracy.\nEvery time we indulge of the fantasy\nthat the elections were stolen,\nevery time we repeat this excuse, we\nchip away at the very system of\ngenerations of Americans that defend our\nvery lives.\nI've served this country until\nretirement.\nI wore the uniform.\nI stood watch.\nI defended the principle of government\nfor the people,\nby the people, for the people.\nI did not defend a king.\nI did not swear to an oath of a strong\nman who treated the law enforcement like\na personal play thing.\nsent chasing conspiracies better than\nsuit the oppressive state than the free\nsociety.\nDemocracy is not a suitable for loyalty\nto one man.\nIt is suitable by truth,\nresistance, and the respect of the rule\nlaw.\nWe could do better.\nWe must do better. I yield the well.\n>> All right. Senators yielded.\nUh I'd also like to\nThere was a uh someone senator asked\nthat uh unanimous consent be given to\nSenator from the 55th to be excused. And\nwithout objection, Senator from the 55th\nbe excused.\n>> Oh, he's back. All right.\nWell, it's wonderful to have you,\nSenator. I don't know how I missed your\n65 self walking in here. So,\n>> you have before you a consent calendar,\na privilege resolution. Does any senator\nwish to remove a resolution from the\nconsent calendar? Is there objection to\nthe adoption resolution on the consent\ncalendar? Chair hears none. And the\nresolution on the consent calendars are\nadopted.\nSecretary, read the resolutions.\nSenate resolution number 645 by Senators\nWalker\nWalker the third of the 20th and others.\nA resolution calling a joint session of\nthe House of Representatives and the\nSenate for the purpose of hearing a\nmessage from the Chief Justice of the\nSupreme Court, inviting each other\njustice of the Supreme Court and each\njudge of the Court of Appeals to be\npresent at the joint session and for\nother purposes.\nMr. President,\n>> Mr. President, Senators Walker, the 3rd\nof the 20th offers the following\namendment. Amend SR, Senate Resolution\n645 by striking clerk of the House on\nline 15 and inserting in its place\nSecretary of the Senate. Mr. President\nthat completes the order.\n>> Recognize the prom speaks of the\nresolution.\n>> Thank you, M. Thank you, Mr. President.\nUh, Senate resolution 645 is a just a\ntraditional thing we do every year about\nthe joint session. There was a scribers\nera saying the clerk of the house on\nline 15 and it needs to say secretary of\nthe senate. So I would ask for unanimous\nconsent on the adopting the amendment so\nwe can correct the scrier's error. Thank\nyou.\n>> Senator yielded.\n>> Is there objection to the adoption of\nthe resolution?\nThe question on the adoption of\namendment one by the senator from the\n20th.
