  "transcript": "all right good afternoon\neveryone good afternoon and thank you\nfor all of you for being here my name is\nJason Estes the proud state senator from\nSenate District 35 and I'm joined by my\ncolleagues in the house in the Senate\nI'm joined by school board members by\nparents and\nstudents I'm joined by members of the\nlegislative black caucus by the Asian\ncaucus and the Hispanic\ncaucus here to talk about an issue that\nimpacts every community in Georgia our\npublic education system and how we fund\nit this year marks the 40th anniversary\nof the Georgia quality basic education\nfunding formula\nQBE over those four decades the world\nhas changed dramatically but our funding\nformula has barely evolved when QBE was\ncreated there were no smartphones\nno internet in classrooms and mental\nhealth support for students was not even\na\nconversation yet we continue funding\neducation as if time has stood\nstill this outdated approach has real\nconsequences schools struggle to meet\nmodern demands teachers who are already\nnot paid enough spend their own money\nfor supplies and in rural districts\nacross this state they face shrinking\nbudgets unless they raise money through\nproperty\ntaxes as a former Middle School social\nstudies teacher I constantly found\nmyself thinking about how to remove\nbarriers for my\nstudents this Antiquated funding formula\nshouldn't be one of those barriers we\ncan't limit ourselves to providing a\nquality basic\neducation our children deserve more our\nchildren deserve an education that\nprepares them for success and for the\nfuture that's why I'm advocating today\nfor full revamp of the QBE formula to\nmeet the realities of\ntoday but we also need to make an\nimmediate change Georgia is one of six\nstates that does not account for poverty\nwhen funding schools we must move\nquickly to change that teachers and\ndistricts and low-income communities\nacross the state face unique challenges\nand we must provide additional resources\nthrough a poverty weight or an\nopportunity Grant what increases the\nurgency for change is the shifting\nNational Dynamic where federal education\nfunding is at risk es especially for\nschool districts with Title One schools\nlike many of the schools school\ndistricts in this state with President\nTrump and Elon Musk threatening to\ndismantle the US Department of Education\nGeorgia must be proactive and take\ncontrol of our educational future\nI am calling on my colleagues in the\nstate senate to adopt Senate Bill 128 to\nadd an opportunity grant that would\nsignificantly benefit rural and urban\nschool districts across the state by\nadding around $2 billion in funding for\neducating students living and lowincome\ncommunities there's a similar bill in\nthe house sponsored by my friend Phil\nlaer that my colleagues in the house\nshould pass as well regardless It is\nWell passed time to modernize how we\ninvest in our children's future and give\nevery student regardless of their zip\ncode a real chance at success with that\nI will now pass it to my friend\nrepresentative\nalalia well good afternoon everyone I'm\nrepresentative Phil olalia it's a\npleasure to join you all here as my\ncolleague just mentioned the opportunity\nwaight and our uh Focus here to finally\nafter almost 40 years adjust our quality\nbasic education funding formula to get\ndesperate resources into the hands of\nEducators and students is top of mind\nand we don't have to go any further but\nto think about what it feels like to be\na young person on an empty stomach\nsitting in a classroom trying to learn\nor a young person whose family uh has\nuprooted three times in the span of one\nschool year because of rising uh house\nprices I'm proud to have\nintroduced the Georgia Ed Educational\nOpportunity Act a bipartisan bill which\nwould create an opportunity weight to\nprovide additional school funding for\nstudents living in poverty as my\ncolleague Senator Estes mentioned we are\none of Six States let me repeat that one\nof six states that currently does not\nprovide additional funding to support\nstudents our children living in poverty\nand as we all know poverty is the\ngreatest impediment the greatest barrier\nstanding in between our young people\ntheir academic success and their\nlong-term\nFutures the Georgia Educational\nOpportunity Act gives every student\nregardless of their background or their\nfamily's financial situation the\nopportunity to\nthrive and our state's funding\nformula was instituted and rolled out a\nyear after I was born which was quite\nsome time ago and I'm sure nobody here\nis driving a 1986 Camry or\nVolvo uh I would like to think that as\nthe times change uh so do our approaches\nand our policies to meet the unique\nneeds that our students our Educators\nand our families have\ntoday and so this bill and we have uh a\ncurrent bill number it's 245 the Georgia\nEducational Opportunity Act uh would\nupdate that funding formula for the\nfirst time and provide those local\nschool districts with additional\nresources uh to lower those barriers uh\nfacing our young\npeople poverty impacts us all this is\nnot a Democrat or Republican issue it's\nnot uh a rural or Urban issue it's not a\nblack or white issue the opportunity\nthat this solution provides would\nbenefit all Georgians especially our\nchildren there are almost 2 million\nchildren prek through 12th grade who are\nbeing educated in classrooms across the\nstate almost half a million our children\nlive living at or below the poverty\nline and so this weight would meet those\nyoung people where they are it would\nprovide schools in rural Georgia for\nexample uh with additional resources to\ntransport students to dual enrollment\nprograms or provide wise Wi-Fi spot\nWi-Fi hotspots to Young Folks who lack\nit for Suburban schools it would address\nour growing Mental Health crisis and\nsupport hiring additional counselors to\nmeet those needs\nheadon while urban districts would have\nadditional resources to pay for school\nmeal programs and provide critical\nwraparound\nservices in my day job I run a local\nnonprofit that works in our local uh\ntital one high schools and I see\nfirsthand the benefits that come from\nhaving additional resources to meet our\nyoung people where they are and lower\nbarriers to\nopportunity and so I'm proud uh to be in\nlock step with my colleagues pushing\nthis effort forward in the\nhouse and I'm hopeful that my Republican\ncolleagues are well are open uh to this\nidea and this solution that is long\noverdue and so thank you all for being\nhere I want to thank Senator Estes and\nmy colleagues for joining us I want to\nthank the parents the Educators and the\nstudents here today who are here to lend\ntheir voice to this cause and I'd like\nto pass it over to my colleague\nrepresentative long\nTran thank you rep representative Phil\nit's my honor to be here as chair of the\nAPI caucus my name is Long Tran uh state\nrepresentative for house District 80 and\nI stand with my Representatives with my\ncolleagues from the house and the Senate\nthe cons the misconception of our API\nCommunity is that we're all affluent and\nwe're all successful in the schools the\nreality is we have demographics that are\nstruggling with poverty whether it's the\nVietnamese Farmers up in Gainesville or\nthe Filipino workers down in south\nGeorgia or the Cambodian Le ocean\nfamilies throughout Metro Atlanta and of\ncourse the recent immigrant families up\nalong Buford Highway poverty is a\nchallenge that we have to address in\nproviding a poverty weight is a way to\nequalize we C these students they look\nat their peers and they see their peers\nwith parents who can provide them with\nthe latest tools latest tutoring systems\nto give them a chance at achieving\nacademic success while these students\nare left to try and pull themselves up\nby bootstraps that they just frankly\ndon't have I was fortunate my parents\nwere refugees from Vietnam and we grew\nup poor but I grew up in a school\ndistrict that adjusted for poverty that\nunderstood why Blue Collar kid Blue\nCollar children who were laid off from\nplants like GM needed assistance to be\nequal with their peers to find academic\nsuccess so for us to become competitive\nas a state and not be among the worst in\nthe nation with academic outcome for us\nto be competitive with New York and\nCalifornia the successful States we must\naddress poverty by providing a weight a\npoverty weight for our schools thank\n[Applause]\nyou good afternoon everyone my name is\nSenator Nikki marett I am the chair of\nthe Georgia legislative Black Caucus and\nI am thrilled to stand in solidarity\ntoday with our Tri caucus members of the\nHispanic caucus and the aapi caucus to\ndemand the long overdue Investments um\nin our school and it's Investments that\nour schools desperately need right now\nand for decades our state has neglected\nto update this funding formula and each\nyear we delay our students pay the price\nyou heard my colleague he I we are\nsupporting or I'm in support of Bill sb1\n128 and we also have a house counterpart\nof that bill HB HB\n245 and we are here in Tri caucus\nsolidarity for both of those pieces of\nlegislation and to really highlight how\nimportant this is no matter what\nbackground you come from it's important\nto those we represent in all of our\ncaucuses every every child in Georgia\ndeserves access to high quality\neducation from from all walks of life\nbut we know especially those areas that\nare the most underserved and education\nis the one tool that anyone in this\nstate can use to better their\ncircumstances better schools benefit\neveryone in a community regardless of\nage or economic status and research has\nproven this time and time\nagain despite this our state once again\nhas dropped to the bottom of a list when\nit comes to taking care of our students\nwhy must Georgia be one of the last\nStates in this nation to prioritize the\nwell-being of our\nchildren every year we see this same\nstatus quo play out we still have not\nupdated the qbn\nfunding and each year that we do it we\nfail thousands of Georgian CH children\nwhen we have the solution right in front\nof\nus I will also remind everyone here that\nmost of these children are still dealing\nwith with the consequences caused by\neducational disruptions related to the\npandemic and this is our chance to do\nright by them in this moment in this\nyear by getting them the help that they\nneed for\nEducation we have a budget surplus of\nover 16\nbillion yet we have not taken this\nsimple step to provide additional\nsupport for children living in\npoverty we we can't claim to be a\nfamilyfriendly state in a bus in a state\nthat's number one in business when this\nis the current state of affairs when it\ncomes to our\neducation we stand here today United on\nthis issue as do the vast majority of\nGeorgia residents our state leaders need\nto understand the urgency of this moment\nand pass this legislation this is\nneither a democratic problem or a\nrepublican problem\nthis is a state\nproblem and this is our opportunity to\nshow students who are our priority that\nwe are willing to invest in our state's\nfuture and invest in them and with that\nI'm going to bring on some from our\ncommunity uh we have some teachers and\nstudents here today who would also like\nto talk to you um first we're going to\nhave sh Bates she is a parent and uh\nshe's going to come up and speak to you\nall thank you\n[Applause]\nhello as she said my name is Char Bates\nI am a\nmother a community advocate of over 14\nyears and the founder of breaking the\nchains due to the poverty in\nGeorgia that has affected so many\nstudents has led\nus to teach teach Advocate and provide\nfor students in six different\ncounties providing everything from food\npantries to graduation fees for over 150\nstudents to clothing\npantries many\ntimes they may be afforded\nopportunities but still can't afford the\nattire to take advantage of the\nopportunity because of their current\ncurrent Financial\nState children don't ask to be born into\npoverty that's not something that they\nhave a choice to be born\ninto\nalso many children are forced to provide\nfor their families before they even turn\n18 many children are also at a place\nwhere they're living with their\ngrandparents these grandparents are on\nfixed incomes many times we have\nprovided food for\nstudents and then turn around and the\nfamily members and the parents or the\ngrandparents will then come back and ask\nfor food for the\nfamilies sometimes these are this is the\nonly food that they have over the\nweekend it's a lot of kids the only\ntimes that they eat is at\nschool it's hard to study when you don't\nknow where your next meal is coming\nfrom\nalso poverty is also the root cause of\ncrimes and\nliteracy so by solving even a portion of\nthe poverty crime we also will be\ndecreasing the amount of crimes as well\nas\nilliteracy the fact that\nGeorgia is one of only Six\nStates but as a previous colleague said\nthat we claim to be a a family loving\nState I mean it's kind of contradictory\nthe amount of money that we spend on\nthings that we don't really need but\nit's all for show when we have students\nin need and families that can be\nprovided for should be behind us after\nthis\nyear the fact of the matter is is that\nwe have an opportunity to change the\nlives of these students we have an\nopportunity to put them in a position to\nwin we have an\nopportunity to change their future not\nallow the financial state that they were\nborn into to determine their future so\nwe ask that you stand behind us we ask\nthat you\nsupport we ask that you advocate for\nthose who can't advocate for themselves\nthank\n[Applause]\nyou good afternoon everyone um my name\nis Rebecca maatu and I am currently a\nsecond year public policy student at\nGeorgia\nTech I am also a product of Gat County\nPublic Schools and I owe so much of My\nSuccess to the teachers counselors and\nopportunities that shaped me but my\njourney also showed me the cracks in the\nsystem literally and\nfiguratively ultimately it is still a\nsystem that like so many others is\nstretch thin today I want to talk about\nwhy fully funding public education is as\nimp erative of an investment in our\nCollective future this is about the\nstudents who are being left behind and\nthe potential we are losing as a\nstate throughout my time in public\nschool I I made use of multiple\nresources such as counseling and school\nbuses in order to bridge the gap between\nFinancial circumstances and\nopportunities from sixth grade all\nthrough high school I was heavily\nreliant on school buses to get to school\nmy parents worked long hours and the bus\nwas practically my only option to get to\nschool every\nday and for many students including\nmyself the school bus was the bridge\nbetween home and opportunity without it\nI wouldn't have been able to attend\nschool consistently and neither would\ncountless of other students across\nGeorgia along with that I was also\nfortunate to attend a school where\ncounselors had the time and resources to\nmake a real difference my senior year of\nhigh school school I found myself\nvisiting the counselor more often than I\never had\nbefore and she really helped me through\nthat college application process\nbuilding organizational habits and also\nhelping me become more mentally\nresilient her guidance helped me\nnavigate my struggles and helped me\nlearn the valuable life lesson of\nadvocating for myself not only did her\nsupport help me through a year of so\nmuch\nuncertainty but she also taught me how\nto ask for help and believe in my own\nability to overcome\nobstacles but even with reliable\ntransportation and exceptional guidance\ncounseling students can succeed in their\nschools if their schools lack resources\nthey\nneed in Georgia funding inequities\nbetween districts are Stark wealthier\ndistricts can afford state-of-the-art\nfacilities and Cutting Edge technology\nwhile poorer districts struggle to\nprovide basic necessities like updated\ntextbooks and safe buildings\nduring the covid-19 lockdowns my high\nschool completed construction on a new\nfacility designed to accommodate our\ngrowing community and prevent\novercrowding this new addition was meant\nto symbolize progress within our\ncommunity however after just one year of\nreturning to school and resuming\ninperson learning I noticed something\nalarming in the girls bathroom on the\nsecond floor there was a large crack in\nthe wall spanning from the ceiling all\nthe way down and it made me wonder was\nthis building safe did it have the\nproper funding it needed to ensure this\ndidn't\nhappen I had these concerns coming from\na relatively well-off public school\nwhich begs the question what the\nconditions must be like in lower income\nschool districts education should not be\na privilege determined by ZIP code and\nwe need Equitable funding to ensure\nevery student no matter where they live\nhas access to Quality\neducation so that's why I'm here today\nto ask leaders to fully invest in our\npublic education system not only just\nfor the students of today but for the\nfuture of our state we must invest more\nand allocate our funds effectively so\nevery child can have proper access to\nSafe schools reliable transportation and\nguidance they need to\nsucceed we have the power to close the\ngaps that hold students back and unlock\ntheir potential to of an entire\ngeneration this is about the child to\ndream of being the first in their family\nto go to college this is about the\nteacher who spends their own money on\nschool supplies and this is about the\nfuture of\nGeorgia as I close I stand here today as\nliving proof of what public education\ncan achieve when we choose to invest in\nit but I also stand here as a reminder\nof how much more we can do as a state so\nlet's not talk about change let's\nactually make it happen\n[Applause]\ngreat\nday I am cozy M Walker the 5th of the\nCarver cluster listed as one of the\npoorest poverty\nlowincome and actually perfect for SB\n284 also I'm a\nGeorgian and\nI I would like the added weight so that\nour families can be made whole in those\nareas as well that\nadded like the Surplus that our governor\nhas and I believe in him so I believe\nhe's smart enough to know to look into\nto see that we need that added weight\nand anyone that's looking sees where\nthere's more education is better where\nthere's less education is worse over on\nmy side so I'm asking to help make our\nstudents whole to give them the chance\nto actually make it through to be\nproductive not be left behind and to be\nGeorgians proud families just like yours\nGovernor we want to look like you help\nus and go ahead and add the extra weight\nthank you thank\n[Applause]\nyou and Jana will be our final\nspeaker\nhi Georgia may be the number one state\nto do business but it comes at the cost\nof our most vulnerable communities young\nGeorgians like myself and our state's\nrefusal to provide specific funding to\neducate children living in poverty as\none of only six states that fails to do\nso I showed up here today because I am a\nproud graduate of public schools in\nGeorgia I was born in Atlanta an\nelementary school I attend in Cedar Hill\nin gwet county and 3 years ago I\ngraduated from decar high school after\nmy family moved closer to my mom's job\nat the Center for Disease Control next\nyear I will graduate from Georgia Tech\nin my home county of dcab alone 18.2% of\nresidents live in poverty just below the\nStatewide rate of\n18.8% but 15 of Georgia's 159 Counties\nhave a poverty rate higher than the\nstate rate overall and recent data\nsuggests as many as\n232 232,000 children across our state\nlive in high poverty areas Decades of\nresearch confirmed that growing up in\npoverty directly affects learning over\nthe last two decades it has become clear\nthat Georgia students who live in\npoverty are being pushed further behind\ntheir wealthier classmates compared to\nstudents in other states the data is is\nclear We are failing Georgia's children\nno matter our background Faith or color\nmost of us believe that our future\ndepends on every child from every corner\nof Georgia receiving a great education\nwhile certain decision makers provide\nhandouts to the wealthiest few so many\nneighborhood schools that nurture most\nof our kids' dreams lie struggling to\nmake ends meet but while our work has\nmade America Prosper a greedy few have\nrigged the rules to redirect resources\nfrom our communities to their country\nclubs from our classrooms to their\nballrooms and from our public parks to\ntheir private jets now they stir fear\nbased on what we look like or where we\ncome from hoping that we'll blame\nEveryday People for the hardship those\nwealthy few create they hope to divide\nand distract us so we don't join\ntogether to demand that our shared\nresources actually deliver the programs\nschools and support that all of our\nchildren need together we should demand\nand we are demanding that our lawmakers\nupdate Georgia's school funding formula\nwhich is twice as old as I am and pass a\npoverty weight so that every public\nschool provides every student with the\ntools and unique resources we need to\nlearn grow and Thrive thank\nyou all right so we've heard from\nstudents we've heard from parents and\nwe've heard from legislators doing the\nwork in this area and we hope that our\ncolleagues join us\nin uh revamping the QB formula to\nincluding an opportunity weight or an\nopportunity Grant and we look forward to\nthose discussions with that I'll open up\nto a few questions\nwell the fact that and we just heard the\nstudent talk about 115 counties uh have\na significantly large uh population of\nthose in living in poverty uh the fact\nthat school districts have had to resort\nto raising property taxes in order to\nfill budget gaps and the fact that in my\nexperience as a teacher or uh as a\nSchoolboard member I've seen how much\nmore it cost to educate uh and and care\nfor and support those who are living in\npoverty we have school districts across\nthe state that have to provide\nadditional resources to to uh to\nstudents and their families and it is\nincumbent on us as a state to support\nthose school districts to reduce class\nsizes to provide additional supports\nlike tutoring and counselors and mental\nhealth supports uh to ensure that that\nwe can remove those barriers that we\noften see in low-income communities\nacross the state so there are studies\nthat show that reducing the class size\nuh would dramatically help with those\nliving in poverty unfortunately too many\nschool districts can't do that because\nof those budget gaps that they\nhave yeah so the state right now is\nactually not dedicating any money in the\nQB formula to those living in poverty\nand that's because we're one of six\nstates that does not account for poverty\nwhen Distributing money to school\ndistricts and that's what we are calling\nto change uh with these with these\nlegislative bills my bill would would\nadd an additional $2 billion that would\ngo to school districts and be dedicated\nto students living in poverty uh\nrepresentative Al I don't know if you\nhave a fiscal note same\nway so so we're looking at roughly 2,000\nper student um if you're uh using most\nrecent figure of half a million\nuh students who will be eligible for\nthat weight it's it's a significant\namount of resources that we' be going\nback into the hands of school districts\nEducators and\nchildren and when we think about going\nback to to the\nquestion from from before when we think\nabout reducing class sizes we have a\nliteracy crisis in the state where 60%\nof our children at third grade are not\nreading on grade level they're not\nproficient in Reading in fourth grade we\nshould be doing what we can to reduce\nclass size sizes and a big start is to\ninfuse those resources into the State\neducation\nbudget no we we are asking for this to\nbe a\na permanent dedication of resources and\nand make sure that moving forward\nGeorgia is a state that takes poverty\ninto account when it comes to educating\nhis\nchildren uh yes there there are are a\nfew different ways free and reduced\nlunch there's a there's several\ndifferent definitions of students living\nin poverty but\nit's mainly relies on free and reduced\nlunch\nclassification uh well right now I'm\nfocused on this legislative session I'm\nfocused on addressing the issues that we\nhave before us and like I said the fact\nthat we have a literacy crisis in the\nstate that has gone uh\nunaddressed I I think we need to move on\nthat now and I think by ensuring that we\ninclude poverty as a consideration when\nit comes to QBE we'll be making progress\ntowards that so I'm going focus on that\nI'm going focus on my constituents in\nfton and cob\nCounty thank you all so much",
