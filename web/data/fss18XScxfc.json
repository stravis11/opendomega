Thank you, Mr. Speaker.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning,\nmembers of the\nHouse. It's my honor to share with you\nthis morning the Reverend Dr. Hugh Ward\nfrom Moltry, Georgia. Reverend Ward, or\nas most of us refer to him as Hugh B,\nwas born in Jackson, Mississippi in\n1940. He graduated from high school in\n1958, went on to graduate from Asbury\nCollege in Wilmore, Kentucky in\n1962. Soon after, he joined the United\nStates Marine Corps.\nin 1966 and was sent to language school\nto become an interrogator. Uh later\ndeploying to Vietnam with the Third\nMarine Division in\n1968. Reverend Ward later received a\nmaster of divinity degree from Columbia\nTheological Seminary and a doctor of\nministry degree from the Graduate\nTheological Foundation. He served 22\nyears as the senior pastor at First\nPresbyterian Church, uh, my family's\nchurch in Moltry, where members of my\nfamily have been long-term members.\nThere are a multitude of honors and\naccolades that Reverend Ward has\nreceived over his many years of service.\nAside from those many honors, the most\nimportant to me is that he married Beth\nand me over 20 years ago. He's baptized\nboth of my children, and he prayed for\nme during some of my most difficult\ntimes in my deployments to the Middle\nEast. Reverend Ward at the very youthful\nage of 84 continues to serve his\ncommunity on a daily basis. His wife of\nmany years died could not join us today,\nbut she still sings in the choir every\nSunday morning in Moltry. They have two\ndaughters, Mandy and Katie, and five\ngrandchildren. Ladies and gentlemen, I\ngive you Reverend Hugh Ward.\nPleasure. Thank you.\nThis probably is one of the greatest\nhonors ever bestowed on me in my\nlifetime. And Mr. Speaker, I've watched\nyou on\nTV. Uh but you look a lot better in\nperson.\nLove you, man.\nAnd second, I have to say how\nheartwarming it is to see the way that\nyou obviously have held Terry England in\nyour prayers and thoughts and such a\nwarm welcome this morning. Sir, it does\nme good to see that here in the state\ncapital. Well, Mr. Speaker and members\nof the house, I'm grateful for the\nopportunity to speak to you this\nmorning.\nI'm grateful to my state representative\nCharles Cannon or as we call him\nChaz. Chaz himself had a distinguished\ncareer in many venues in the\nclassroom on the athletic field as\ngraduate of West Point the military\nacademy on the battle on the battlefield\nin the Middle East and now in the public\narena. He's retired Army officer. His\nwife Beth is a registered nurse. His two\nbrothers-in-law also served with\ndistinction in the United States Army as\nwell. But thank God their pastor is a\nUnited States\nMarine.\nHurrah. And then this is a word about\nyour work, not my work. Here I bring\nwords of gratitude for my president and\nCEO of Conquer Regional Medical Center,\nDr. James Matney and from our foundation\nstaff. Thank you for your unwavering\nsupport of the Georgia hard program.\nThis program has enabled Cocket Regional\nMedical Center to expand its service\nlines to bring several capital projects\nto fruition and assist with the care of\nour indigent patients. Our rural\nhospital has a feisty effective Georgia\nheart administrator named Gina Horn\nMcDonald. She has out hustled every\nother healthc care facility in South\nGeorgia as she spread the good news\nabout supporting our local\nhospital. I also applaud the work of my\ngood friend Sam Watson who's across the\nway there. Former father, husband to\nEmily, and an effective and devoted\ncitizen. I want you to know something\nabout my county where I've been a part\nof for 35\nyears. It has given birth to some of our\nstate's greatest endeavors.\nthe Sunb Belt Expo. And if you've never\nbeen there, I hope you'll come and see\nthe great things that happen there. The\nMoose Moss Diving\nTigers, Saxby Chamblas makes his home in\nMoltry. a YMCA that comprises\n65,000 square feet of space, the\nbirthplace of Ameris Bank, which we knew\nas ABC Bank in the early days, a\nnationally recognized hospital, and the\nPhiladelphia College of Osteopathic\nMedicine and some of the finest churches\nthat excel in reaching out to a needy\nworld. I love living in Cockwood County.\nRepresentative Cannon's father-in-law,\nFrank Harrison, kidnapped me from\nDecatur and brought me to an island of\ntranquility in Conquort County to pastor\nthe First Present\nChurch. But speaking to you this morning\nenables me to give you a\ntestimony that I did always plan to be a\npreacher and a\npastor. No, I'm here to confess to you\nthat at one time I actually worked for a\nliving.\nI pedal chemicals for a major\ncorporation, Ashlin Chemical Company.\nOne of my favorite purchasing agent was\na man named Larry Moore at Masonite\nCorporation in Laurel, Mississippi. He\nhad been a Saberjet pilot in Korea. But\nI'll be honest with you, when I met him,\nhe weighed as much as a saber\njet. And over lunch one day in a small\nbarbecue joint in Laurel, Larry looked\nover an ear of corn dripping with butter\nonto his paisley tie and he said, \"What\nwould you be doing if you weren't\ncalling on me?\" I said, \"I'd be playing\ngolf.\" And he said, \"No, you idiot. What\nwould you be doing with your life?\" And\nI said, \"That would be a different\nquestion. I would resign from Ashlin and\nbecome a Presbyterian\npastor. If you resign now, he said, this\ntime next year you'll have a year behind\nyou. And so I here I am 53 years later\nbefore you. God speaks to us in a\nplethora of ways and sometimes we\nlisten. You, ladies and gentlemen, are\none of the largest congregations I've\never addressed in my whole life as a\nminister. And ever since Mr. Canon\ninvited me to be your chaplain for this\nday. I have prayed mightily that you all\nwould have wisdom and courage to serve\nthis great state faithfully. I believe\nyou will all work for the welfare and\nhappiness of all to see that justice and\ncompassion are allotted to your folks\nback home and throughout the entire\nstate. Look, I know and you know we live\nin a beautiful but burdened world. And\nat times it appears that our poor\nbleeding world is stumbling from one\nblunder to\nanother. But we, the citizens of your\nstate, have elected you, whom we believe\npossess a broad vision for tapping the\nwells of wisdom, a wisdom that leads us\nin these challenging days toward a\nfuture of peace and prosperity.\nAnd so, though I am not your personal\nspiritual guide, I'm here to encourage\nyou in your labors, praying you will\nhelp us all pass on to our children a\nbetter world than the one we received\nfor God's good and God's\nglory. I pray that this day in your\ndaily\nadventures, you'll love the Lord your\nGod with all your heart, with all your\nsoul, and with all your\nstrength, and your neighbor as yourself.\ntime. You\nstand. I'd like to ask you to pause for\na moment of silent\nprayer as you pray for\nTerry, as you pray for your\nconstituents, as you pray for our state\nand our nation. Would you pause with me\njust for a quiet moment?\nOh Lord our\nGod, your love is unfailing and your\nmercies are renewed every\nmorning. At this moment, we lift up our\nsouls to you as honestly and completely\nas\npossible. As we're able to do this, oh\nLord, fulfill in us what you long to\naccomplish, our freedom from sin and\nselfishness, our release from anxiety,\nlives tuned to truth and beauty,\ndevotion and\ngoodness. We know, Lord, that you're the\nbeginning and the end. You see the end\nfrom the beginning, and you have seen\nhave seen us and been with us in all the\nordinary moments of our life. You have\nlaid your hand upon us in ways that are\nbeyond our comprehension. And because of\nthis, we have seen for ourselves the\nextraordinary ways you're involved in\nthe most ordinary moments of our\nlives. And we come to you. We come to\nyou thinking of the rhythm of our lives,\nthe daily routines we have here, of\nsleeping and waking, of washing and\ndressing, of eating and saying goodbye.\nWe come thinking of our work and the\nboredom and excitement that comes from\nour daily toil here in this hallowed\nplace. In the midst of our thousands of\nwakings, in the course of meeting our\nconstituents, and even in the fractured\nmoments of our life, we know, oh Lord,\nif you speak anywhere, it is here in the\nmidst of our living. But it is in the\ncracks and crevices of our existence, in\nthe hairline fractures of our life, we\nare not alone. We have come to know that\nyou're the God of victory for us, for\nall of us. You're victorious over sin\nand death, those things which have a\nstrangle hold on humanity. Because of\nyou, we're awakened to a living hope\nthat after every cross comes a\nresurrection. After every winter, there\nis a spring. As we commit ourselves to\nyou, let us go forth from this place\nwith our confidence restored. That\ncompassion is able to conquer greed,\nthat peace can overcome war, that love\nis stronger than hate, that life is\nmightier than death. With that\ninspiration, let us arise and go into\nthe world to find beauty and simplicity,\nto find riches and plain living, to find\nself-worth and self-giving. For your\nsake, O Lord, we pray. Amen.\nI pledge algiance to the flag of the\nUnited States of America and to the\nrepublic for which it stands. One nation\nunder God, indivisible, with liberty and\njustice for all. Awesome.\nGreat message.\nDoorkeepers, you may unlock the\ndoors. Members, you may join Brother\nWard, Dr. Ward in the South Annie room\nalong with along with U.

This bill referred\nto the committee on health. That\ncommittee recommends that this bill do\npass.\nChairman Hawkins is recognized to\npresent Senate Bill 72.\nSpeaker, uh Senate Bill 72 is also known\nas the Hope for Georgia Patients Act. It\nis an addition to chapter 52, which is a\nGeorgia right to try act. This\nparticular bill deals with experimental\ndrugs and devices for folks that are\nterminally ill and have no way to\nsurvive with typical treatments. Um, if\nyou look on page five, and I'll quickly\ngo through this. Uh, the first section,\nit deals with proof of need. Of course,\nit must be\nlife-threatening. And it's also uh\nthere's an analysis done of the\npatient's genome. These will be DNA and\nRNA uh type active drugs. Next section\ndeals with uh release of\nresponsibility.\nUm bottom of page six, manufacturers\nflexibility. Uh top of page seven, this\nis not a mandate. It's not an insurance\nmandate. Um and then at the bottom of\npage seven, the docs are not held liable\nfor trying these uh techniques, methods,\nand\nmedications. Then the next section\nspeaks to the release of manufacturers's\nliability. Next comes the personal\nliability release. And again, it\nreiterates this is not a mandate. This\nbill is the last hope for some patients\nto have a chance to live a little bit\nlonger. That's the bill. Mr. Speaker, if\nthere's no questions, I will um\nrelinquish the well and vote for your\nfavorable consideration.\nThey might have a chair and sit down.\nYeah,\nyou have a question to your right.\nRepresent Chairlady Silcox is recognized\nfor a question. Does the gentleman\nyield? I do. Isn't it true, Mr.\nChairman, that this bill will allow\ncancer patients that have drugs that\nbeen have totally not been approved by\nthe FDA to try experimental drugs as a\nlast chance on their life? That's very\ntrue and I appreciate the question. Some\nof these drugs take many, many years to\nbe able to make it to market. This will\nallow a patient to a shortcut for a drug\nand probably the only drug that will\nwork for them and a chance for extended\nlife. Thank you for the question. Thank\nyou for bringing the bill. I appreciate\nit. Thank you. Thank you, Chairman. Dr.\nHawkins, you have no further questions.\nThank you. The gentleman's yielded the\nwell. Is there any objection to the\nprevious question being ordered? Hearing\nnone, the previous question is ordered.\nIs there any objection to agreeing to\nthe report of the committee which was\nfavorable to the passage of the bill?\nHearing none, the report of the\ncommittee is agreed to. Shall this bill\nnow pass? All in favor of the passage of\nthe bill, we'll vote yes. All those\nopposed will vote no. And Mr. Cler, will\nyou unlock the machine?\n[Music]\nHave all members\nvoted? All members voted. If so, Mr.\nClerk, will you lock the\nmachine? On the passage of Senate Bill\n72, the yays are 161, the nays are zero.\nThis bill having received the requisite\nconstitutional majority, is therefore\npassed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the\ncaption of Senate Bill 63 63?

This bill referred to the\ncommittee on education that committee\nrecommends that this bill do pass by\ncommittee substitute.\nThe lady from Columbus, Representative\nCarmen Rice, is recognized to present\nthe bill. Representative\nRice. What Senate Bill 63 does is it\nwould allow it was a provision to allow\nhomeschool students to take um their\ntests their senior year getting ready\nfor college. Those tests would include\nPSAT, SAT, preACT, ACT, the AVAB, and\nadvanced placement test in their locally\nzoned schools. And so, um, and it also\nrequires a provision that the school\ndistrict would announce and put online\nthe information for the registration for\nthese tests. The homeschool students are\nwilling to pay any fee that a student in\ntheir zone school would have to pay. and\nthen the school district would pay the\ncost that they would of any student\nthat's within the school. And with that,\nMr. Speaker, I will take questions. You\nhave no questions.\nThank you. And I ask for your favorable\nsupport of this bill. I appreciate it. I\nyield the well. Ladies yielded the\nwell. Is there any objection to the\nprevious question being ordered? Hearing\nnone, the previous question is ordered.\nIs any objection to adopting the\ncommittee substitute?

On the passage of Senate\nBill 63, the yays are 166, the nays are\nzero. This bill, having received the\nrequisite constitutional majority, is\ntherefore\npassed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the\ncaption to Senate Bill 8585?\nSenate Bill 85 by Senator Brass the 6th\nand others to be entitled act to amend\narticle 12 of chapter 3 of title 20 of\nthe official code of George annotated\nrelating to post-secary education grants\nfor foster children and adopted children\nso as to establish a grant program. This\nbill referred to the committee on higher\neducation. That committee recommends\nthis bill do pass by committee\nsubstitute.\nRepresentative from Swainsboro, Georgia\ndown in Emanuel County, Representative\nButch Parish. Mr. Chairman's recognized\nto present the bill.\nThank you, Mr.\nSpeaker. Ladies and gentlemen, Senate\nBill 85 establishes the Georgia Foster\nCare Scholarship Act and it provides\ngrants to former foster youth for\nundergraduate education. It sets\neligibility based on age and and\ninvolvement with the Department of\nFamily and Children Services. The\nfunding for this program is subject to\nannual appropriations and a former\nfoster youth is eligible for for the\nfoster care scholarship. If the young\nperson is under the age of 26 and is in\nfoster care or was in foster care for\nsix months after the age of\n14, the scholarship will be in an amount\nto cover the students tuition, room,\nboard, books and deducting any\nscholarships or tuition waiverss or\nfederal and and state financial grant uh\ngrants available to them. No scholarship\nwill exceed $30,000 per year. Uh the\nscholarship may be used at any hope\neligible Georgia institution to which\nthe student has been\nadmitted and the scholarship is\navailable for no more than 10 years\nthrough the completion of a bachelor's\ndegree or a total of 190 hours or 127\nsemester hours. And I'll remind you that\nthe appropriations for this is subject\nor the funding is subject to annual\nappropriation. Mr. Speaker, if there's\nany questions, I'll try to answer them.\nIf not, I'll ask for your favorable\nconsideration.\nGentleman has a question or two. Okay.\nYes, sir. Representative Moore to your\nleft is recognized for a question. Good\nmorning. Does the gentleman yield? Yes,\nma'am. Isn't it true that as a foster\nparent, I'm excited about this bill?\nWhen it came to committee, I almost did\na backwards flip. Isn't it also\ntrue that I wish this bill had been\nwritten 10 years ago? So many children\ncould\nhave have uh had a course change of\ncourse in their life just from this\nbill. And I look forward to seeing\nGeorgia's foster children attend and\ngraduate college. Congratulations. Thank\nyou so much for your comments. I\ncertainly think it can have a positive\neffect on many of the youth in this\nstate. Thank you.\nRepresentative Chastain to your right is\nrecognized for a question. Mr. Chairman,\ngentlemen, yield. Yes, sir.\nIs it not true that by establishing a\ngrant program for the foster children\nthat this Senate Bill 85 directly\naddresses the financial barriers that\noften hinder uh vulnerable youth from\npursuing a higher education. Yes, sir.\nGreat program and thank you all. I know\na lot of you have interest in what DeFax\ndoes with our foster kids and this will\ncertainly be a great handout to help a\nlot of folks. Thank you very\nmuch. Gentleman has yielded the\nwell. We did have a speaker that is\nsigned up to speak in favor\nrepresentative Park Cannon, but I don't\nsee Representative Cannon.\nThere she is.\nTake your time.\nRepresentative Cannon is recognized to\nspeak to Senate Bill 85. Give the lady\nyour attention, please.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you,\n[Music]\nmembers. I'm here to speak in support of\nSenate Bill 85. I wanted to just bring\nto attention that I feel this\nlegislation addresses really the future\nof our state and a commitment that we're\nmaking to our future. I think it's not\njust a policy, but it's actually a\npromise to countless young people who\nhave navigated the challenging impacts\nof the foster care system. I have spent\na lot of time with individuals who aged\nout of the foster care system what we\nconsider too young before we changed it\nto 21. um establishing this scholarship\nfor those in the Georgia foster care\nsystem for eligible students currently\nenrolled under the age of 6 26 really\nhelp us with our statistics surrounding\nyouth in the Georgia foster care system.\nIf you've looked at them, you know that\nthey are quite sobering. They face many\nobstacles that can make educational\nattainment seem insurmountable. With a\nlack of family support, financial\ninstability, and the emotional scars of\ntheir experiences, these young\nindividuals often find themselves at a\ndisadvantage. However, this bill gives\nus a chance to change that narrative. It\nactually provides these grants to the\nfoster care youth who meet specific\nrequirements. The requirements I believe\nhelp us ensure that the financial\nbarriers do not hinder their pursuit of\nhigher education. I think it's essential\nto a note that this program is subject\nto appropriations, meaning that we all\nhave to remain committed to ensuring\nthat these funds are available. It's our\nlegislative responsibility not only in\nthis measure but in the budget to\nresponsibly advocate for the necessary\nresources to support our youth.\nMoreover, I believe for the adopted\nchildren, just as generally\nrecognizing that whether they've been in\nfoster care or whether they've actually\ngotten adopted, they deserve the\nopportunity to thrive, we as legislators\nand parents should really see this bill\nthrough to the end. I'm hopeful that the\nfoster care youth that are listening\nright now and that are outside know that\nwe are committed to your opportunities\nto succeed. I want us to all vote in\nfavor of this bill. Thank you, Mr.\nSpeaker.\nA lady has completed her remarks and\nyield to the\nwell. That completes all those that\nsigned up to speak to the bill.

Mr. Cler, will you read a caption\nof Senate Bill 233?\nSenate Bill 233 by Senator Brass of the\n6th to be entitled an act to amend\narticle 6, chapter 1, and title 37. The\nofficial code of Georgia annotator\nrelating to behavioral health reform and\ninnovation commission so as to revise\nthe subcommittees. This bill\nhaven't this bill haven't been assigned\nto the committee on public and community\nhealth. That committee recommends that\nthis bill do pass.\nAll right, members, if you'll all please\ntake your seats and uh give the lady\nwho's coming to the well your attention\nas she presents Senate Bill 233.\nRepresent Sharon Cooper is recognized to\npresent Senate Bill 233. Chair Lady\nCooper. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies\nand gentlemen of the House, I'm bringing\nSenate Bill 233. Uh this was requested\nby Commissioner Tanner as he runs our\ndepartment of uh behavioral health and\ndisabilities. U this is about a\ncommission that is housed there under\nhim, the behavioral health reform and\ninnovation commission. it has been made\nup of 24 members and he uh asked that be\nextended to 30. Uh when he took over the\ncommission was made up of mainly of\nhealth professionals uh psychiatrists\ndifferent kinds of doctors uh forensic\npsychologists licensed clinical\nbehaviorists and what they found out\nthey were really lacking. and people who\nhad experienced mental health problems\nthemselves or they have family members\nor they had lost a family member uh due\nto fentanyl or drugs and this bill\ncorrects that. It adds six members and\nthey are specifically listed as someone\nhas lived experience having survi\nsurvived the disease of addiction or\nsomeone who has lost a member of his or\nher immediate family to drug overdose or\nfentanyl poisoning. Uh so I would ask\nfor your favor consideration. I believe\nthat will make the commission more\ninclusive and it did extend it for a\nyear. So with that, Mr. Speaker, I will\nleave the well if there are no\nquestions. You have one question. Yes,\nma'am. Representative Gamble, to your\nright, straight out in front of you.\nDoes the gentle lady yield? I do. Is it\nnot true uh that Commissioner Tanner and\nthe Georgia Council on Recovery have\nbeen very instrumental working with you\nand so many of us on this piece of\nlegislation. This is good for all of\nthose Georgians, over 900,000 Georgians\nthat are in in recovery and we certainly\nwant to see that number increase, and\nthis will help to do that. I I\nappreciate the uh question from the\nmember. You what you say is certainly\ntrue and Commissioner Tanners has been\ndoing a excellent job not just about on\nmental health issues but also with our\ndisability community. So once again I\nwill yield the well and ask for your\nfavorable vote. Thank you\nladies yield to the will. We have a\ncouple of speakers. I'm going to\nrecognize Representative Park Cannon and\nRepresentative Mary Margaret Oliver.\nRepresentative Cannon, I gave\nRepresentative Oliver heads up about\nfive minutes. Max, can you do it in that\nlength of time? Go for it.\nRepresentative Park Cannon is\nrecognized.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker. You're excited\nabout this bill. Really looking forward\nto having some more members who are able\nto help us on this innovative\ncommission. I do think that it's\nimportant that we consider possibly in\nthe future adding paranatal providers to\nit since we are dealing with mental\nhealth outbreaks of those who have\nrecently been pregnant. But I am here in\nsupport of it. I have spent time with\nmany individuals who unfortunately have\nbattled addiction, who have experienced\noverdose, and who are impacted by the\ndecision-making here today because the\nchallenges surrounding behavioral health\nare multifaceted. We must draw the\ninsights of those who have navigated\nthose challenges firsthand. Their\ndiscussions will enrich our lives and\nmake our policies more compassionate.\nIt's necessary to commit continue this\nimportant work towards meaningful\nbehavioral health reform that we have\nstarted many years ago. Many of you will\nsee this is not a sprint. This is a\nmarathon. It requires our sustained\nefforts, our commitment, and our\npatience with these individuals. I think\nthis legislation does have some\nstructural changes, but it's really\nfostering a culture of support and\nunderstanding for those experiencing\naddiction. I'm just grateful for this\nbill and invite you to vote yes with me.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nThank you for your comments. Ladies\nyield as well. Representative\nRepresentative Mary Margaret Oliver is\nrecognized to speak to the bill.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker. I also rise in\nsupport of Senate Bill 233. I've had the\nprivilege of serving on this commission\nfor several years. And for those of you\nthat might be new to the House, I'd like\nto tell you why this particular effort\nhas been uniquely successful with the\nsupport of the governor, with the\nsupport of the speaker, and with the\nsupport of the lieutenant governor. You\nmay be aware, I think you are aware that\nthis effort began under David Rston who\ncame forward and told us members that he\nwas tired of not being able to help the\nfolks in his district with serious\nmental illness. He always said the same\nthing. He always said he was tired of\nnot being able to help people. He said\nthat his wife always told him that\nyou've got to help people and not only\nthink about elections. He said, \"We're\ngoing to pay for what we do as we go.\"\nAnd he said, \"It's going to be\nbipartisan.\" And he stuck by that. And\nothers have stuck by that, too. The\nreason this has been successful is that\nthere was a unified effort of\nleadership. We have over the last four\nyears contributed over half a billion\ndollars of new mental health monies.\nThat's prior to whatever we'll make some\nprogress with hopefully in this fiscal\nyear 26 budget. It also gives credit to\nthe structure which we're changing a\nlittle bit in this bill, a positive\nchange. The structure was not based on\npolitical appointees. There only one or\ntwo House members, only one or two\nSenate members that's not changing. It\nwas the professionals in the field from\nyour districts in different categories\nof caregivers. and the substantive work\nthat's gone on through the subcommittee\nprocess has been extremely strong based\non professional expertise and not\npolitical agendas. The additions to the\ncommission as set forth in 233 are\nrecognizing the very strong\ncontributions necessary contributions\nfrom the addiction community across\nGeorgia. This has always been a mental\nhealth and addiction commission effort\nand the addition of additional addiction\nrelated professionals and addiction\nrelated family members is strong. We\nalso are having an ongoing discussion.\nThis is coming out of CHOA. It's coming\nout of your health care providers.\nWhat's the difference between the\ndevelopmentally disabled and the\nmentally ill? And that conflict in some\ncases that combined diagnosis in other\ncases has reach has reached us and we\nare particularly with uh leadership\nthat's coming in a wide variety of ways\nfrom the settlement of the civil rights\ncase in relation to the services to the\ndevelopmentally disabled. This is a\nstrong addition to the very strong\nhistory and basis. We're extending the\ncommission for one year. Many\ncommissions I've served on, I've only\nserved one year. They may or not even\nmet. But this commission is unique and I\nask for your support. Particularly the\nsupport of uh Commissioner Kevin Tanner\nwho as a good leader does many many\nhours of work if not most of the work on\nthis commission. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.\nLadies yielded well. Thank you for your\ncomments. That completes our discussion\non Senate Bill 233. Is there any\nobjection to the previous question being\nordered? Hearing none, the previous\nquestion is ordered. Is any any\nobjection to agreeing to the report of\nthe committee which was favorable to the\npassage of the bill? The hearing? None.\nBoard of committees agreed to. Shall\nthis bill now pass? All in favor of the\npassage of the bill, we'll vote yes. All\nthose opposed will vote no. And Mr.\nClerk, will you unlock the\n[Music]\n[Music]\nmachine? Have all members voted?\nall members voted. If\nso, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the\nmachine? On the passage of Senate Bill\n233, the yays are\n164, the nays are two. This bill has\nreceived the requisite constitutional\nmajority is therefore\npassed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the\ncaption to Senate Bill 9, SB9?\n[Music]\nYeah, it was just sitting there a minute\nago.\nThat's the confusion. You gave me\nSenate Bill Nine by Senator Alberts, the\n56 and others be titled act to amend\npart one of article 3, chapter 12 of\ntitle 16 of the official code of Georgia\nannotated relating the general\nprovisions relative to obscenity and\nrelated offenses so as to repeal and\nreplace code section\n161280. This bill haven't been referred\nto the committee on technology\nand and infrastructure innovation. And\nthat committee recommends this bill do\npass by rules committee substitute.\nThank you, Mr. Clerk. Chair recognizes\nRepresentative Brad Thomas to present\nthe bill. Representative Thomas. Thank\nyou, Mr. Speaker. Today I rise to\npresent Senate Bill 9. Uh this bill was\npassed through technology infrastructure\ninnovation committee. Uh and it was a\nhouse priority last year as\nHB986. Unfortunately, it didn't quite\nget across the line in the Senate. So,\nlet's start by discussing this the crime\nthat's listed in this bill. In order to\nbe found guilty of of uh fraudulent\nelection interference, you have to do\nmeet the following criteria, and I'm\ngoing to talk through them by line\nitems. Line items 38 for 43 defines who\nthis applies to and is specific to\npolitical organizations. We've roughly\nestimated that this actually would apply\nto somewhere between 2 and 4,000 uh\npeople statewide. It has to be\nmaterially deceptive. In order to do\nthat, one, it has to depict a real\nindividual that speech or conduct that\ndid not occur in reality. And it has to\nappear to a reasonable observer to be\nauthentic. Three, it has to be uploaded\nand disseminated with the knowledge of\nits falsity, which is one of the highest\nstandards that you would have to prove\nin court. Uh, it again it also has to be\nin line 46. It has to be within 90 days\nof an election, which is really\nimportant. This is a piece of\ninformation that 90 days tightly\nprescribes it to the election process,\nwhich makes sure that it it doesn't hit\nany constitutional\nissues. Say you do meet all those\ncriteria. If you do, this is the major\nuh major change from last year's bill is\nthe first offense is a misdemeanor. The\nsecond offense is a felony. Last year,\nthe first offense was was a felony.\nUh, so what's not covered as a crime in\nthis\nbill? Lines 55 through 57. First\namendment protected speech is not. And I\nwant to make that very clear. First\namendment protected speech, such as\nsatire and parody as listed on line 56,\naka memes, are explicitly written as not\napplying in to this bill.\nUm, if you create any media and provide\na disclosure of its generated, you can\ncreate a a a image or um a video or\ndeceptive media is but it's not\nconsidered deceptive if you just put a\ndisclaimer on it that simply says it's\nAI generated and it defines what that\nis.\nUm, so here's another one that I got.\nI I hate to tell y'all, but people like\nme might need a little bit of help\nlooking good um\nvisually. Thank you. U and we may use AI\nto make us look a little bit better in\nparticular\nmedia. This is explicitly once again\nlines 134 136 minor editing is excluded\nfrom this bill.\nAnd again, if you can create content 97\ndays out and it's not affected by this\nbill. And I want to make something else\nclear. This is about visual and audio\nfiles. So text that you would create.\nSay you use an AI and you create text\nthat is not included in this bill. It's\njust visual and\naudio. So let me boil this down for for\ny'all. If you\nget accused of a misdemeanor first\noffense in this, this is what you would\nhave to do. You'd have to be one of\naround a couple thousand people in the\nstate that are specifically tied to\npolitical action campaign or committees,\npolitical compi committees, or as\ndefined in the bill. You'd have to\ncreate an AI generated video audio and\ndistribute it with the intent to deceive\nand throw an election. You'd have to\nupload it within 90 days of an election.\nyou you didn't put you didn't put a\nsimple disclaimer on it that said it was\nAI generated and it had to be the level\nof quality that it was to deceive other\nvot uh to deceive electorate and with\nthat Mr. Speaker I feel like I've\npresented the bill I'd be happy to take\nquestions\ngentleman has a couple of questions uh\nrepresentative Lisa Campbell to your\nleft is recognized for a question thank\nyou Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman\nyield? I do. Um, can you just uh verify\nfirst uh what LC number we're looking\nat? Uh 492385s.\nNo,\nI'm I'm honest. Okay, I got the it's\nmaybe LC. You know what? I'm sorry. I\nknow grabbed the wrong one.\nIt's a different Thank you,\nRepresentative Williams. Although I\nwould tell you my my bill number is\ncorrect that I presented. It's LC56041S.\nOh 1s. Okay. Thank you. And um will you\naccept another question please?\nAbsolutely. So I just want to make sure\nI understand any and all use of AI and\ncampaign materials regardless of the\nscope and span is allowable as long as\nthere is disclosure. Um I wouldn't say\nit's even more tightly prescribed than\nthat. um within 90 days of an election.\nIt is completely fine. It's not\ndeceptive if you put a label on it that\nsays it's AI generated. So, thank you.\nAnd then um and then minor editing. Um\nwould something like if you are using AI\non yourself or someone else uh say you\nedit um a facial feature, would that be\nconsidered minor editing or not? No,\nbecause it doesn't change the substance\nof the actual image in and of itself. uh\nthat that and that is I can find the\nline item in here where it's explicitly\nwritten but it is explicitly excluded.\nOkay. Thank you. I just wanted to\nclarify what I'm reading is line 140\npart B minor editing of a piece of\nexisting audio or visual it which is a\nlittle broad. So I'm just trying to\nunderstand maybe in a practical example.\nUh, I I would say if you've seen some of\nmy campaign mailers, um, it I need a\nlittle minor editing that doesn't\nsubstantially change the the observer's\nunderstanding of such media. And that\nthat that's the point of making sure\nthat a lot of Photoshop is regularly\nused. And I don't mean to use Photoshop,\nbut it does have an AI component in it\nnow. And let's make sure we don't we\ndon't inadvertently capture that. And\nwould you allow just a a tiny bit of a\nfurther clarification on this? Sure. Um\nmy question is really trying to\nunderstand um in past C campaigns we've\nseen in opposition oppositional\nadvertising changes to your opponent's\nfeatures not your own your\nopponents would that be considered minor\nI I wouldn't say that it substantially\nchanges the observer's understanding of\nthe media meaning like if they change it\nto the point where they've now have that\nindividual committing some crime that\nthey didn't commit then that would be a\nsubstantial change, but minor image\nchanges wouldn't apply to this bill.\nThank you. Yep.\nGentlemen, you representative Rice to\nyour left is recognized for a question.\nThank you, speaker. Do you yield? I do.\nIs it not true that by defining and\ncriminalizing the use of materially\ndeceptive AI generated media and\ncampaign advertisements, this bill helps\nprotect the integrity of Georgia's\nelections and ensures that voters\nreceive accurate information? I I I\nwould agree with that and and you know,\nwe we talked a lot. What people don't\nrealize is we spent a significant amount\nof time on this last last session um\nwith regards to making sure that we did\nnot feel in any way we infringed on some\nfirst amendment rights. But if we have\nmultiple videos of of elected officials\nthat have deceptive material in it and\nthere's no possible way to identify\nwho's who actually I would ask you whose\nfirst amendment rights have been taken\naway. If no one can believe what you\nsee, then then whose first amendment\nrights has actually been taken away?\nIt's been the person that did something\nthat was proper or you know operated\nwithin the bounds of what the law is.\nThis is just simply to say this it's to\nlet the electorate know that what they\nhave is AI generated or it happened in\nreality and I think that that's an\nacceptable place to be in a first\namendment situation.\nAnd thank you for the question.\nYou have one more question if you if you\nwant to take it and then we have some\nspeakers on the bill. Uh yes, Mr.\nSpeaker, I'd be happy to take any\nquestions. Representative Jasmine Clark\nto your left is recognized for a\nquestion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does a\ngentleman yield? I do. All right. So,\nwe've had this conversation a couple of\ntimes. we did um about the 90 days and I\nunderstand that the um I guess\nexplanation for why you would um say if\nit's 91 days you can do all these things\nbut as soon as you hit the 90-day\nthreshold it does I understand that it's\nsomething about legally how you can tie\nit to an election but could you not tie\nit to elections based on the content of\nwhat is being presented and doesn't this\n90day days really handcuff us from\nprotecting people because\num yeah, we're already seeing ads for\n2026 now and I'm just a little worried\nthat this still allows that deceptive\nmaterial into the frey. Are you So, it's\na it's a fair question. Uh the 90 days\nhas been something that we are now have\n21 states that have adopted some version\nof this bill. Um I would say that the\n90-day rule typically is in there to tie\nit to make sure it's specific to\nelection, but it also gives at within 90\ndays. You know, a lot of campaigns don't\nhave a lot of money. They're not a a US\nsized race that have the campaign funds\nto be able to to combat this type of of\nfalse or deceptive media. So, uh,\nkeeping it at 90 days at least gives an\nopportunity for time for the campaigns\nto come back and put something out\ninstead of it just being a last minute\nthing two days before the election day\nand it throws an election and that's\nreally what this is about. So, thank\nyou. Did you further yield?\nReal quick question. Absolutely. I\nunderstand that but I think what you\njust said is what my concern would be.\nIf a campaign that is very well funded\nhas 300 days or whatever 365 minus 90\nis, I don't feel like doing math. They\nhave that many days to make deceptive\nmaterials about you and then it's just a\n90-day moratorum. How do you undo that\ndamage? And a lot of times in the in the\nlaw we use the word reasonable and why\ncouldn't we just say if it could be\nreasonably\num assumed I don't assume is not the\nright word but you know tie it to a\nreasonable expectation that this was\nabout an election so therefore you\ncannot do it this way. I'm just\nwondering is there a workaround to I\nthink that again we get into this really\nquestion about first amendment rights\nand we want to make sure that we're\ndoing everything we can and by tying it\nto an election of the date we did it\nonly further tightens the\nthe I guess guard rails to make sure\nthat if if it does go across to the\njudicial branch and they want to take a\nlook at it it's very tightly prescribed\nwe feel like it can survive uh and it\nwill eventually we will get some more\nguidance from the judicial branch on\nwhat's acceptable and what's what's not.\nBut right now, I have to tell you this\nis one of the most tightly prescribed\nbills in the United States. So, thank\nyou for the question. Thank you.\nUh with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield the\nwell.\nGentleman is yielded the\nwell. That completes the uh initial\ncomments on the bill. We have some folks\nsigned up in favor of and those are\nopposed. I'm going to recognize repres\nRepresentative Charlie Bird to speak to\nthe bill. Representative Bird.\nGive the lady your attention, please.\nGood afternoon. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.\nMy fellow\npatriots, I rise in fierce opposition to\nSenate Bill Nine, a bill straight out of\nGovernor of California's\nplaybook, designed to crush free speech\nand silence. We the people. It isn't\njust bad policy. It is\nanti-MAGA, anti-America attack on our\nrights. Last year, Georgians stopped\nHB986. Now the radical left is back with\nSB9, sneaking it through procedural\ntricks because they know we would never\naccept this tyranny\noutright. It's California's liberal\nstyle censorship criticizing,\ncriminalizing deceptive media within 90\ndays of an election. Who decides who's\ndeceptive? Win 90 days of the election.\nWho decides who's deceptive? A\ngovernment board picked by the same\nestablishments that's used to us before.\nThis isn't freedom. It's Soviet style\ncontrol.\nSB9 could jail you for so-called\ndeception, exposing\ncorruption on felony charges up to five\nyears. We already have deception laws\nfor lies that harm. This is silencing\ndisscent plain and simple. If it passes,\nGeorgia becomes like California.\nthe centers in\nhandcuffs. To my Republican colleagues,\ndo you want to be the ones who brought\nCalifornia liberalism agenda here to\nGeorgia? This is about liberty itself.\nIt is not moving voting no. I'm\nrejecting this\nunconstitutional assault on the first\namendment with everything I've got. When\nwe come for our first speech, free\nspeech, I am never going to stop\nfighting. Mr. Speaker, I yield the well.\nLady has yielded the well. We have\nseveral other speakers on the issue.\nI'll recognize Representative TR for\ncomments on Senate Bill 9.\nRepresentative Tran. Thank you, Mr.\nSpeaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I rise\ntoday in favor of SB9. And to clarify, I\nmay look like an AI deep fake of the\nminority whip and the only Filipino\nmember of the House, but I am indeed not\nan AI deep fake of these members.\nIn all\nseriousness, just a year ago, we saw New\nHampshire during the New Hampshire\npresidential primary, a voice robocall\nwent out to Democratic voters that\nimitated President Joe Biden's voice and\ntold Democratic voters not to go out and\nvote. And that is the danger of AI that\nposes us today. As we are in an arms\nrace within the election campaign\nseason, those with the best technology\ncan generate AI at the fastest levels,\nwith the deepest of fakes, with the most\nrealistic renderings of ourselves. And\none day we are going to reach a point\nwhere technologically AI can generate\nthese deep fakes at a speed where in a\nmicroscond they can generate 365 days\nworth of campaign material to be used\nagainst us or used to defend us. So, we\nhave to be concerned because I'm\nconcerned about the human element of our\nelections, the most important part of\nour elections where we go out to voters\nand we shake their hands, we listen to\ntheir concerns, we meet with them one\nonone. But if we hit a point in which we\nbase our elections and win our elections\non AI technology, we will lose that\nhuman element. we will lose the most\nprecious part of our democracy and that\nis hearing from our constituents. So\nwith that, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well\nand ask the members to vote in favor of\nthis bill.\nThe gentleman has yielded the\nwell. Representative Sanchez is\nrecognized to speak to the bill.\nRepresent Sanchez.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise also to\nuh speak in favor of Senate Bill 9. I\nbelieve this is a great bill that helps\nensure elections are not riddled with\nmisinformation, distractions, and\ninterference. In fact, uh I was actually\ntalking to my family just the other day\nabout this, how why we don't have\nlabeling of AI when you see it on social\nmedia. And this I'm glad that this bill\nhas this measure in it uh to help with\nthat because a lot of people struggle to\ndifferentiate between something that's\nAI and something that's real. and that\ncan have a huge impact not just on our\nelections but on daily life in general.\nAnd so I'm glad to have this measure in\nthe bill for our election process at the\nvery least. Uh I know some of my\ncolleagues brought up legitimate\nconcerns about the 90-day window and I\ndo agree that it should be longer, but I\ndo think we have to start this now\nbecause we are currently have elections\nright now in my county. We have a\nspecial election in less than a month,\nright? And so we need and we have\nelections this November as well. So we\nneed to do something as soon as possible\naround this issue because it's it's a\ngrowing in intensity and danger and just\nin general when in regards to artificial\nintelligence we have to remember that\nyou know there's a lot of great uses for\nthis technology medical uses efficiency\nin certain sectors but we always have to\nmake sure when new technology emerges\nthat we balance with the good and the\nbad that comes with every new\ntechnology. We have to make sure that we\nkeep Georgians safe and well informed,\nespecially in the times that we're in\nright now. I believe we need to make\nsure we target our use of AI to only\nwhere it's truly needed because as many\nof you know, AI has become a huge drain\non our energy and resources,\nspecifically when it comes to\nelectricity demand and water\nconsumption. And so it is a great tool\nbut some studies have actually shown\nthat just to train the model of this\nkind of uh technology like open AAI's\nGBT-3 it consumed over 1,200 megawatt\nhours of electricity which is the\nequivalent of powering 120 homes in one\nyear a carbon dioxide emission of 552\ntons. The study was funded by Google who\nis implementing their own AI program. So\nit might even be\nunderounted. Throughout our history, we\nhave\nseen new technology emerge that makes\nlife easier. But with every invention,\nwe must learn the consequences of\nunchecked unregulated use. Our\nenvironment, our air, our water cannot\nbe disregarded in the pursuit of turning\nour family photos into studio Giblly\ncharacters. If you get that reference,\nyou're a real one. Once again, I support\nthis bill as a great first step in\nsetting up guardrails for this important\nemerging technology. I hope that we\ncontinue working on this issue to\ncontinue to ensure the safety and\nwell-beings of Georgians and I urge you\nto vote yes on SB9. Thank you. I yield\nthe well, Mr. Speaker. Thank you. Thank\nyou. The gentleman's yielded the well.\nRepresentative Beckles.\nThe lady's recognized to speak to Senate\nBill 9. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.\nToday I rise in support of Senate Bill\n9, a common sense measure to protect our\nelections from AI\nmanipulation. This\nbill this bill does two simple things.\nFirst, it makes it illegal to knowingly\npublish fake AI generated videos or\naudio that falsely show candidates\nsaying things they never said, but only\nwhen done to deliberately deceive voters\nwithin 90 days of an election.\nSecondly, it creates clear rules for\ncampaigns that want to use AI content.\nThey can still use it, but must include\na disclaimer that clearly identifies\nwhat is AI\ngenerated. This isn't about restricting\nfree speech, political satire, parody,\nart, or journalism remains fully\nprotected. As technology advances, our\nlaws must keep pace.\nThis targeted bill protects voters from\ndeception while preserving our\nfundamental freedoms. I urge your\nsupport. Mr. Speaker, if I may, full\ndisclaimer. I did ask my AI cousin\nClaude to generate a floor speech that\nyou guys can understand. Thank you, A.\nLuell.\n[Music]\nThanks, Claude.\n[Music]\nWhoever Claude\nis. Representative Williams, you know\nwho Claude is? I didn't think you\ndid. Chairman Todd Jones is recognized\nas speaker of the bill. Representative\nJones.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker. Vance, I have\nyour blue sheet up here. I'll bring it\nback for\nyou. This is a serious subject and a\nserious day. I'm just going to take a\nfew minutes of your time, but there's\nbeen a couple of things lobbed here that\nneed to be addressed. The fact is is\nthat we are responsible in so many\ndifferent ways to 10.7 million Georgians\nto ensure that when they go into the\nelection box, they can trust that the\nelection box is in fact filled with 100%\nintegrity. We always argue about whether\nor not there should be paper ballots,\nmachine ballots, machine score. We talk\nabout audits. We talk about everything\nabout what the voting process is. But I\nwould argue with you, the most important\nthing we can do for our constituents is\nto ensure that when they go into that\nbox, when they are saying to themselves,\nI'm going to cast the ballot for this\nindividual or for this referendum, the\nmost important thing we can do for them\nis make sure that we have given them\naccurate information.\nWe cannot live in a world where our\nconstituents, 10.7 million Georgians,\nalmost 6 million voters are asking\nthemselves, \"What I just saw, is it real\nor is it not real?\" At that point, the\nintegrity of the election, no matter you\nif you fall on paper ballots or machine\nballot, is\ngone. We have to be able to vote towards\nwhat we know to be right. And let's talk\nabout\nAmerican. We talk about the\nconstitution. The constitution speaks to\nthe idea that if an individual is\ncharged with something, they will face a\njury of their peers. This does that. But\nit does it in such a way that it has the\nmost loftiest bar. They must do it with\nspecific intent. It must be proven that\nthey knew the falsicity of it. They must\nhave taken the action to download that\nvideo or that image. And it must be done\nin such a way that a reasonable person,\na reasonable individual would say this\nis in fact something that would affect\nthe election or infect the integrity of\nthe election or the administration of\nthe election. So, I ask you\nthis. Alabama, our sister to the West,\nand 21 other states, but I'll focus on\nAlabama, have taken the exact same\nlanguage and unanimously put it through\nboth chambers, and a Republican governor\nsigned\nit. A previous speaker spoke to the idea\nof liberty.\nWe can all go on and on and I'm sure\nmany of you have in your election, in\nyour town halls, and any comments that\nyou make to your peers and to your\nconstituents all about liberty and the\nfact that you've been called to serve in\nthis chamber. You were called because\nyou believed in the Constitution and you\nbelieved in making sure that everyone\nhas the opportunity to in fact pursue\nlife, liberty, and the pursuit of\nhappiness. What this document does is\nensure that everything that our\nconstituents see is in fact something\nthey can in fact take to the bank. And I\nask you to to support this bill. I ask\nfor your favorable consideration and Mr.\nSpeaker, I yield the\nwell. Gentleman has yielded the well.\nThat completes our discussion on Senate\nBill\n9. Is there any objection to the\nprevious question being ordered? Hearing\nnone, the previous question is ordered.\nIs there any objection to withdrawing\nthe committee substitute? Hearing none,\nthe committee substitute is withdrawn.\nIs there any objection to adopting the\nsubstitute offered by the committee on\nrules? Hearing none, the committee the\nrules committee substitute is adopted.\nIs there any objection to agreeing to\nthe report of the committee which was\nfavorable to the passage of the bill?\nHearing none, the report of the\ncommittee is agreed to. Shall this bill\nnow pass? All in favor of the passage of\nthe bill, we'll vote yes. All those\nopposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk,\nwill you unlock the\nmachine? Have all members voted? For\nwhat purpose? Representative\nRepresentative Al Williams rise.\nParliament for inquiry.\nState your inquiry. Sir, is it not true\nthat the last speaker I wanted to make\nsure mentioned that that leftleaning\nradical liberal state of Alabama passed\nthis br this bill? That's what I heard\nhim say. Thank you, sir. Gentleman's\ncorrect. He he'll have to correct that\nin the media. I won't correct it for\nhim. Now, we have great friends over\nthere. Specled better is a fine man. And\nI'm certainly he does a great job in\nthat Alabama\nHouse. Have all members\nvoted? All members voted this. So, Mr.\nClerk, will you lock the machine? On the\npassage of Senate Bill 9, the yays are\n152. The nays are 12. This bill having\nreceived the requisite constitution\nmajority is therefore\npassed. Mr. Clerk, will you read a\ncaption to SB69, Senate Bill 69?\nSenate Bill 69 by Senator Kenny the 18th\nto be entitled an act to amend title 7\nand article five of chapter 11 and title\n9 of the official code of Georgia\nannotator relating to banking and\nfinance and depositions and discovery\nunder the Georgia civil practice act\nrespectively so as to regulate third\nparty litigation financing practices in\nthis state. This bill having referred to\nthe committee on rules that committee\nrecommends that this bill pass by rules\ncommittee substitute LC 49\n2394S. Representative James Burchett is\nrecognized to present Senate Bill 69.\nRepresent Burchett.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon,\ncolleagues. I rise to give you my\nsupport and ask for your vote on Senate\nBill 69. Senate Bill 69 seeks to fill a\nhole in the code. Currently, there are\nno provisions whatsoever that outline\nregulations on um litigation financing.\nNowhere in the code will you find it.\nSo, what this bill seeks to do is put\nsome guard rails and regulation on the\nindustry. Um, for some of you that don't\nknow, there are companies out there that\nwill finance litigation\num, and they will seek a um, interest in\nany judgment that is had in that\nlitigation. And there has been testimony\nthat suggests that some of these\nlitigation financeers\num, will influence how and how a piece\nof litigation is litigated. and and in\nin my opinion that is, you know, not not\ncorrect, not right. Um the the uh\nfinance here should not uh weigh in on\nthe decisions that the lawyer uh and the\nclient make. And so what this seeks to\ndo here is uh put some guard rails up\naround this industry. And so I'm going\nto run through some of of what the bill\ndoes here. Uh first off, it defines what\na litigation finance seere is. Currently\nthere is no definition in code. Um and\num also defines what a litig litigation\nfinancial agreement is or financing\nagreement is. It also uh puts in um uh\nwhat provisions are required in a\nlitigation uh agreement. Some of which\nare the recital of what I just said is\nthat the um uh litigation financeier\ncannot weigh in on the process of\nlitigation. cannot uh for instance\ncannot say all right if you guys are\ngoing to settle I don't want you to\nsettle this is not enough to settle for\nthat's one of the um um claims that I\nheard in testimony some of the other\nprovisions it requires in these\nlitigation agreements is um that there\ncan be no amendment um of the contract a\nwithout written agreement um obviously\nthe the clear um uh name and principal\naddress of the finance here and it\nrecites um that uh again um finance\nyears cannot inject themselves into the\ndecisions of the parties or the\nlitigators. Um what the bill also does\nit um it defines who can be a financeier\nlitigation financeier and it's in line\nwith our financing institutions. In\nfact, it's in the code section for banks\nand banking. And what it requires is\nthat for instance, if uh much like a\nbank or financing institution, if you\nhad a felony in the past uh 10 years,\nyou cannot be a financeier uh under this\nbill. One of the other things and I'm\nsure we'll hear about uh if you're a\nforeign adversary of the United States\nas dictated by the federal government,\nthen you cannot also be a\nfinanceier. Um, one of the the largest\nprovisions in the bill is that it\nrequires registration uh of these\nfinanciers with uh the department of uh\nbanks and financing and um also gives\nthe ability of the commissioner to deny\num a financeier if they don't meet the\nrequirements of this code section while\nat the same time allowing for some due\nprocess for that uh financeier if they\ndisagree to uh request in writing a\nhearing. to make their\ncase. Um it exempts u importantly I\nthink um an agreement that it's uh\ntaking a case on contingency between a\nparty and um a litigator or lawyer. So\nif I want to take a case and essentially\nI'm financing my u fees and and my work\nthroughout the case then it exempts that\nuh sort of arrangement and that\narrangement is um pretty customary in\nsome of these um civil cases.\nUm it's one of the the provisions in\nhere is any if if if the financing\nagreement or the finance year does not\ncome in line or comport with the\nprovisions in this bill then that\ncontract is void or um non-actionable\num discoverable. And then lastly it it\nsays that any of these agreements uh are\ndiscoverable in litigation. So as a\ndefendant, if a plaintiff is utilizing\nfinancing, then they can discover both\nthe terms of the contract and what the\ncontract is. So, um, if if I'm litig\nlitigating against the party as the\nplaintiff, then I could discover whether\nor not, uh, excuse me, as a defendant,\num, I can discover whether or not the\nplaintiff is utilizing a finance here\nand then how much that financeier is\nfinancing of, uh, this litigation. I\nthink what this bill does is puts a\nregulation and parameters around an\nindustry that is frankly wide open at\nthis point. Um, I know there's been u\nmany hours of of testimony and debate\nover this subject matter and um I'm\nasking excuse me my colleagues to uh\nplease favorably consider uh Senate Bill\n69. Um and the LC I'm reading from is LC\n492394s. And with that, Mr. Speaker,\nI'll yield for questions. Gentleman has\na question. Representative Raman, right\nup the center aisle on your left.\nDoes the gentleman yield to my friend? I\ndo. What's with the face? It's a It's a\nfine question, I promise. Um, just to\nconfirm, this will not apply to bail\nfunds, nonprofits, things like that.\nCorrect. That's correct. Yes. Uh, there\nis a provision that I just spoke with\none of my colleagues about that exempts\nnonprofits that um, uh, it's on\nline 372.\nGentleman, yield for another question.\nYes, sir. One more. Representative Rice\nto your left extreme way to your left is\nrecognized for a question. Thank you,\nMr. Speaker. Do you yield? I do. Is it\nnot true that prohibiting entities with\nforeign affiliations from acting as\nlitigation financeers safeguards our\njudicial system from potential external\ninfluences? I I can't I can't agree\nmore. uh representative. I think this um\npreserves the sanctity of our civil\njustice system as well as gives\nprotections to consumers and litigants\nin the process. And with that, Mr.\nSpeaker, uh I will yield the well. The\ngentleman is yielded the well. We do\nhave one speaker signed up to speak to\nthe bill. Chairman Todd\nJones. Chairman Jones is recognized to\nspeak to SB69. Representative Jones.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker, and my apologies\nto the body. I don't typically get up\nand speak and now twice in a row, but I\nthought this was so important because of\nthe conversations that we've had over\nthe last two years about third party\nlitigation funding. If you think about a\nphraseology that you hear from our\nconstitutional officers consistently is\nwe're number one business, pardon me,\nthe number one state to do business. You\nhear that over and over that 11 straight\nyears we've been the number one state to\ndo business. I want to try and make an\nargument with you very quickly that what\nwe should really be looking for is to be\nthe number the number one in innovation,\nthe number one in thought leadership\nbecause here's a piece of data that I\nthink should concern this entire body\nand our friends across the third\nfloor. We are eighth in GDP. New Jersey\nis ninth. North Carolina is 10th. The\nchallenge is our growth rate is\nliterally a third of North Carolina's\nand a half of of New Jerseys, which\nmeans by about 2030 we will drop to 10\nand possibly by 2035 drop to 11. We have\nto be thinking of different ways to get\nmore innovation into our economy, into\nour industries. One of the ways that we\nprotect innovation is to ensure that bad\nactors don't capture trade secrets,\npatents, and other intellectual property\nthrough bad actors and the litigation\nprocess. Third-party litigation funding\nhas a purpose, and I agree with the\nwhip, but it also could be used as a\nsword against our nanotechnology\ncompanies, our logistics technology\ncompanies, our cyber companies. How do\nwe ensure that that doesn't occur? SB69\ndoes that. So, I ask for your favor\nconsideration for all the reasons that\nthe majority whip laid out for you. But\nI would also ask you to add just one\nadditional component. And that component\nis about the future of Georgia. It's not\nabout 2025 or 2026. It's about 2030 and\n2035 and 2040. We must protect the\nintellectual property of not just our\nlarge corporations, but what I hope to\nbe the next Apple, the next HP, the next\nGoogle inside of some garage here in\nAtlanta or in North Georgia or in South\nGeorgia. Let's protect them. Let's\nprotect the future and let's make sure\nthat we keep Georgia on a pathway not\njust to be eighth in the union in GDP,\nbut hopefully one day jumping up to\nnumber one and unseeding that that state\nthat sits on the West Coast. Thank you\nvery much and I yield the well. Number\none. I like the way that\nsounds. That completes our\ncomments. Discussion on Senate Bill 69.\nIs there any objection to the previous\nquestion being ordered? Hearing none.\nThe previous question is ordered. We do\nhave a minority\nreport up to minority report is\nwaved. Thank you.\nIs there any excuse me is there any\nobjection to withdrawing the committee\nsubstitute? Hearing none the committee\nsubstitute is withdrawn. Is there any\nobjection to adopting the the substitute\noffered by the committee on rules?\nHearing none, the rules committee\nsubstitute is adopted. Is there any\nobjection to agreeing to the report of\nthe committee which was favorable to the\npassage of the bill? Hearing none, the\nreport of committee is agreed to. Shall\nthis bill now pass? All in favor of the\npassage of the bill bill will vote yes.\nAll those opposed will vote no. And Mr.\nClerk, will you unlock the machine?\nHave all members\nvoted? All members\nvoted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you\nlock will you lock the\nmachine? On the passage of Senate Bill\n69, the yays are a 98. The nays are 69,\nthis bill, having received the requisite\nconstitutional majority, is therefore\npassed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the\ncaption of Senate Bill 105105?\nSenate Bill 105 by Senator Anna Devarte\nthe 31st and others to be entitled act\nto amend chapter 50 and title 43 the\nofficial code of Georgia annotator\nrelating to veterinarians and veterary\ntechnicians. So as authorized license\nlicensed veterinarians and veterary\ntechnicians to practice\nveterary tea advice. This bill have\nconferred the committee on agriculture\nand consumer affairs. That committee\nrecommends that this bill do pass by\ncommittee substitute.\nTransportation chair Jasper's recognized\nto present the bill. Representative\nJaspers.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, Senate\nBill 105 is for the expansion and the\nuse of tele medicine in the veterary\npractice. And when I was asked to do\nthis bill, I kind of went sentimental. I\nhave two great veterinarians in my life\nthat have taken care of my kids animals,\nmy 4ers, my FFA kids, and our community,\nMike Christopher and Dr. Mike Zagger.\nAnd I hope they're\nlistening. What this bill\ndoes is enforces the veterary client\npatient relationship that is the bedrock\nof a veterary practice. This means\npractically for you that every veterary\npractice will have to have a\nrelationship with your\nanimal before they can diagnose it using\ntele medicine. It's the same way they do\nit now. We've had many bills that over\nthe past few years using tele medicine\nand medicine and dentistry and all sorts\nof things and the veterinarians have\nworked hard on this. So if your vet\noffers tele medicine, you'll be able to\nuse your phone, your iPad to communicate\nwith your\nveterinarian. Now this is really very\nimportant in large animal veterary\npractices where there's a shortage of\nbig shortage of veterinarians and many\nmiles between them in your care. This\nwill help a lot in improving that care.\nIn the bill you'll notice there's a lot\nof language guiding the use of tele\nmedicine. These veterinarians are very\nthorough in writing a bill. Also in this\nbill you'll see telet triage and tea\nadvice. Teletriage is used to determine\nwhether or not immediate referral is\nneeded to a licensed veterinarian.\nYou'll be able to call and have that\ndone. Now just like I said a moment ago,\nsince you don't have the veterary client\nrelationship, they cannot\ndiagnose. Tell advice is what it says.\nIt's I like to say it's call a vet.\nyou'll be able to ask general questions.\nThe key thing in all three of these\nsections is it's Georgia licensed\nveterinarians are doing the work and\ntheir associates in their offices.\nSomeone asked me about pay a few minutes\nago. This bill does not address pay.\nThat's these are small businesses.\nThey'll do pay as they choose, but it\ndoes create a very clear framework. In\nsection four, you're going to see House\nBill 91 that was done by Chairman Cooper\nbefore crossover. So, we've seen it and\nvoted on it and passed it easily. This\nwill allow those who have graduated from\na foreign school of veterary medicine a\npathway to practice and most importantly\nteach in Georgia. these we are shortage\nof many of these specialties across our\nstate or in our state education and\nthey'll be able to do it but they have\nto be licensed in Georgia this gives\nthem a pathway to do it this legislation\nis the work of Georgia veterary medical\nassociation the cattleman's association\npleasure animals all the different ones\nhave had their input in it and Mr.\nSpeaker and members, our veterinarians\nare very serious about the care of pets,\nyour pleasure animals, and our food\nanimals, and they've worked very hard to\nimprove the ability of care in this\nmodern age. And I ask for your favorable\nconsideration and vote on this measure\nfor our veterinarians. Mr. Speaker, I'll\nbe glad to answer any questions if there\nare any.\nYou have at least one. Representative\nBarnes to your left. Represent Amati\nBarnes is right. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.\nDoes a gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am.\nUm, you said we had a shortage of\nveterinarians. Do we also have a short a\nshortage of vet techs as well? Oh,\nabsolutely. All right. Thank you. Well,\nI hope this uh helps out for our\nshortage in the state. Thank you. Yes,\nma'am.\nProfessor, gentleman has no further\nquestions. Thank you. It's your\nfavorable vote. Thank you. Thank you for\npresenting the bill. I know you know a\nlot about animal husbandry. That's where\nyou came from. So, thanks for your work\nand your career and thanks for bringing\nthe bill. Is there any objection to the\nprevious question being ordered? Hearing\nnone, the previous question is ordered.\nIs there any objection to adopting the\ncommittee substitute? Hearing none, the\ncommittee substitute is adopted. Is\nthere any objection to agreeing to the\nreport of the committee which was\nfavorable to the passage of the bill?\nHearing none, the report of committee is\nagreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All\nin favor of the passage of the bill?\nWe'll vote yes. All those opposed will\nvote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock\nthe machine?\nHave all members\nvoted for what purposes? Representative\nBuckner rise.\nAre you trying to say something? She\nwaves. All members\nvoted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock\nthe machine? On the passage of Senate\nBill\n105105, the yays are\n1688. The nays are zero. This bill\nhadn't received the requisite\nconstitutional majority. Is therefore\npassed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the\ncaption to Senate Bill 5656?\nSenate Bill 56 by Senator Anna Dearde of\nthe 31st and others to be entitled act\nto amend part one of article five of\nchapter nine of title 45 of the official\ncode of Georgia annotator relating the\nGeorgia state indemnification fund so as\nto authorize the department of\nadministrative services to purchase\nannuities for the payment of\nindemnification\nclaims. This bill referred to the\ncommittee on public safety and homeland\nsecurity. That committee recommends that\nthis bill do pass.\nChairman Gullet is recognized to present\nSenate Bill 56. Representative\nGullet. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Senate\nBill 56\nuh is related to the identification\nfund. Um currently the Georgia State\nIdentification Program provides a\nfinancial benefit for designated public\nsafety officers who are disabled or\nkilled in the line of duty. These\npayments are made through the Georgia\nState Identification Fund, which is\noverseen by the Georgia State\nIdentification Commission and\nadministered by DOAS. This bill\nestablishes a presumption of\nqualification for identification related\nto CO 19 for deaths occurred on or\nbefore April 15th of 2022. Yes, sir.\nYes, sir. Um, we know that there were 68\nCOVID 19 deaths that would qualify and\nthe state was only able to pay 39 of\nthem. Uh, this bill would pay the\nremaining 29. The money was already\nappropriated in the amended budget that\nwe passed and was signed by the\ngovernor. Uh, and I'm happy to answer\nany any questions. Mr. Speaker,\ngentleman has no questions. Thank you so\nmuch. I urge your favorable\nconsideration. You the well. Thank you\nfor your work on the bill. Is there any\nobjection to the previous question being\nordered? Hearing none, the previous\nquestion is ordered. Is any objection to\nagreeing to the report of the committee\nwhich was favorable to the passage of\nthe bill? Hearing none, the report of\nthe committee is agreed to. Shall this\nbill now pass. All in favor of the\npassage of the bill, we'll vote yes. All\nthose opposed will vote no. And Mr.\nClerk, will you lock the\nmachine to receive it? Christ's got it\nready. Do you want it out? Yes.\n[Music]\nHave all members\nvoted? All members voted? If so, Mr.\nClerk, will you lock the\nmachine? On the passage of Senate Bill\n56, the yays are 165, the nays are a\nzero. This bill haven't received the\nrequisite constitutional majority is\ntherefore passed.\nMr. Clerk, will you read the caption of\nSenate Bill 40?\nSenate Bill 40 by Senator Hatchet to the\n50th and others be titled an act to\namend article 14 in chapter one of title\n10 of the official code of Georgia\nannotated relating\nsecondary metals recyclers so as to\nprovide for applicability of the\ndefinition of the term used detached\ncatalytic converters. This bill I\nreferred to the committee on regulated\nindustries that committee recommends\nthat this bill do pass by committee\nsubstitute.\nRepresentative Lauren McDonald is\nrecognized to present the bill.\nRepresentative McDonald.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and\ngentlemen of the House, I bring you\ntoday Senate Bill 40.

This\nis a very good friend of mine. And uh I\nwant you to do something. I want you to\nremember this name. His last name is C O\nF I E L D Koffield. Charles Koffield\nfrom Chadzsworth, Georgia. I want you to\nread his\nobituary. It's a good read.\nvery\nunusual. I want to tell you a little bit\nabout Charles. He's uh first I want to\ncondolences to Bernita, his wife and his\nfamily. Some special friends in his\ncompany that are very special to me.\nThey know who they are. As I heard about\nthis and read, I thought of things in\nCharles life that I knew. Boys Life\nmagazine, of course, Boy Scouts, a\nNorman\nRockwell painting, Tom Sawyer, N\nRockchy, Thomas\nEdison, John Wayne, and Father Knows\nBest.\nEach time I left with Charles, left\nspeaking with him, if I rode in a car\nwith him on a hunting trip or spent time\nwith him playing\ncards, I never\nleft that I didn't feel better about\nhumanity and I didn't feel better about\nmyself. Charles was a mentor, a\nmotivator, and built character among his\nemployees.\nHe will be greatly\nmissed. And I will finish by\nsaying I'll see you again someday\ncuz sorry. Every community has people\nthat make it a better place. Charles\nKoffield was one of those people. He was\nvery accomplished. But what made him\nspecial was his presence when he walked\nin a room. Whether it was surrounded by\nmillionaires or ditch diggers, Charles\naka John Wayne had the unique ability to\nmake you listen. His wisdom and his\nstories never got old. He invested in\npeople he was having a conversation with\nand mentored countless of business\nowners in Northwest Georgia and around\nthe world, including myself. It was an\nhonor to be his breakfast cook for 25\nyears. his wife and family employees all\nhave a huge void to fill and we could\nnot let this day pass. Today's the day\nof his funeral without paying homage to\nthis one-of-a-kind individual. Rest in\npeace, John W.\nThank you, members. Sounds like a very\nspecial\nman. A ripsity\nbail has remembrance if\nyou remain standing on a passing of a\nloved\none. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for being\nacknowledged. Colleagues, I feel like\nI've been keeping a secret. Uh, my\ngrandmother passed on March 9th, and I\njust would like to give her a moment of\nremembrance.\nReverend Church was deeply influenced by\nher family's values of hard work and\neducation with her laboring father as a\nPullman porter that provided for her\nfamily and her mother ensuring that she\nhad an academic foundation beginning at\nExpelment College Nursery School. She\npursued her education through\nsegregation, excelling at Ashby Street\nSchool, Booker T. Washington High School\nand later earning a bachelor degree in\narts and m in bachelor degree in biology\nand a minor in mathematics from\nSpellelman College at the age of 20 and\nearned her master's degree in library\nscience from the Atlanta University as a\nfellow of the Andrew Carnegie Library.\nShe embarked on a distinguished career\nin library science beginning at Howard\nUniversity. Reverend Church was a\ndedicated civil rights advocate\nsupporting her husband Dr. Roy C. Bell\nand her cousin Dr. Martin Luther King\nJr. specifically in the work of the with\nthe Southern Christian Leadership\nConference and instrumental to the\ndesegregation of Grady Memorial\nHospital. But her life kept unfolding.\nAt 57, she became a real estate broker.\nAt 74, she became an ordained minister.\nAt 77, she earned a doctorate in m a\ndoctorate in ministry. And at 90, she\nwas still driving the church, housing\nthe unhoused, and dancing through life\nwith style and grace. Even in her final\nyears, she minded. Even in her final\nyears, her sharp mind and humor and\nquick and her faith was unwavering.\nReverend Church has left no dreams\nunpursued, no lessons unlearned, and no\nlove unexpressed. Her tenacity and\nprayers and legacy live on as as live on\nwith us. She kept unfolding until the\nday of her life and had completed her\nmasterpiece. Earlier this year, I gave\nyou all a book. And if you if you will,\nplease continue to stand with me. If I\nread a\nprayer, please assume the posture of\nprayer. Dear Lord, you said in your\nword, out of the abundance of your heart\nand the mouth speaketh. Father, it is\nout of the abundance of my heart that I\nspeak love. I speak\nappreciation. I speak thanks. I speak\njoy. I speak blessings. I speak peace. I\nspeak good success. I speak victory. I\nspeak prosperity. I speak hope. I speak\nfaith. I speak these things by the power\nof the Holy Spirit. Thank you, Lord, for\nliving within me. For your words say,\n\"Greater is he that is in me than he\nthat is in the world.\" Thank you Lord\nthat I can do all things through Christ\nwho strengthens me. I know the Lord is\nin you. I live I know the Lord in you. I\nlive and move and have the being and\nhave my being. I give all the glory and\nhonor to you. It is it is in the\nprecious name of the Jesus I pray. Amen.\nThank you Mr. Speaker. I yield the will.\nThe memorial service will be tomorrow at\nthe Word of Faith Cathedral at 11:00.\nThe visitation will be at the Murray's\nbrother's funeral home this afternoon.\nThank you. Thank you.\nThere's nothing like having a wonderful\ngrandmother and sounds like you had one\nas\nwell. Our condolences to the family.\nRepresentative Park Cannon is recognized\nfor and after an\norder\nmembers got some folks joining\nyou. Representative Cannon and friends\nis this condolences represent Cannon.\nNo, it's\nnot. Y'all may be seated.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker. Four years ago,\nmy life changed here at the state\ncapital. Um, there was a two-page\nelection bill that overnight became a\n20page election bill, Senate Bill 202.\nOur chamber adjourned for the day. Many\nmembers went out to the right down the\nstairs and I got a text message that\nsaid that that bill was being privately\nsigned in the governor's office. I went\ndown the lefthand stairs here and\nshortly after was unlawfully arrested,\ntaken to Rice Street Jail, given two\nfelonies, which I would have had to\nserve eight years. When I came back that\nnext day with my arm in a sling because\nof the treatment that I received, there\nwere some members who disagreed with me.\nThere were many members who stood with\nme. I want to thank those who stood with\nme and I want to thank those who\ndisagreed with me because it has really\nmatured me as a person. It has helped me\nto understand that I am in this work for\ngood trouble. I'd like to thank Dr. King\nand his family. His family actually came\nand walked me back into the state\ncapital. There were a number of\ncommunity members who wore shirts and\ncame and lined the halls so that I felt\nsafe that day coming in the state\ncapital. And even right now as we speak\nwith uh John Lewis up in heaven, I can\nhear him being so proud of me on that\nday. He used to always say, \"Part,\nyou're so young. Park, you're doing it.\nPark, keep going. Park, keep the fight.\nKeep the spirit.\" And so today, I come\nto you to let you know, I started a\nphrase then on which I knocked on that\ndoor that we will keep knocking. and I\nhope that you too find a way to keep\nknocking in your community. Sometimes\nthose doors shut in front of you and\nsometimes they open. As an update on my\ncases, um I am now unfortunately having\nto sue the state of Georgia. I had my\nday at the Georgia Supreme Court in May\nand found out unfortunately that I was\nnot successful in my case. And so now I\nhave a few other cases and a few other\ndivisions seeking justice in the state\nof Georgia. And until we seek justice,\nwe keep knocking. Thank you very much\nfor your attention today.\nI yel the representative Roman is\nrecognized for an afternoon\norder and friends. Thank you, Mr.\nSpeaker. colleagues, I grew up here and\nwords like liberty and freedom and\nprotection from tyranny actually deeply\nmean something to me personally. They're\nnot rhetorical devices I use to appeal\nto the other side. They are actually\nthings I grew up sincerely and deeply\nholding as a priority in my life. And\nafter today's conversation, it made me\nkind of realize we are in a bubble right\nnow because next week session ends and\nso we're all trying to get our bills\ndone and I get that. But right now\naround the country there are people who\nwhen they are walking down the street\nare being approached by masked\nunidentified people put into unmarked\ncars and disappeared sometimes for weeks\non end. This is not an\nexaggeration. Many of you have spoken to\nme about various policies as it relates\nto immigration enforcement and reassured\nme that whatever we do here is all about\ngetting the criminals. Well, I can tell\nyou right now that I know plenty of\npeople who are not criminals that are\nliterally being disappeared. That is not\nan\nexaggeration. And in addition, those\nthat we know of are legally here under\nvisas, under green\ncards. And the administration has\nexplicitly said they are not charging\nthem with crimes. And yet somehow we\nhave now found a way to criminalize\nspeech because anybody who stands with\nme as a Palestinian or my community is\nnow being deemed as a terrorist\nsympathizer. The thing about liberty is\nthat it is actually much easier to lose\nthan we think. And a lot of times we end\nup being manipulated to willingly give\nit away.\nSo today, I was frankly inspired to come\nto this afternoon order last minute\nbecause I really sincerely hope that in\nour in weirdly sort of mediadriven world\nthat we can for once look and critically\nassess the decisions being made with our\nsupport and what they could mean across\nthe board and as I always say the\nunintended\nconsequences. I am deeply deeply deeply\nfearful of the road that we are on right\nnow. When somebody who is unidentified\ncan just put you in a car, that to me is\nterrifying. So, colleagues, please, keep\nan ear out on your constituents, keep an\neye out for your\nconstituents because unfortunately, we\nare now hearing these cases regularly,\nmultiple times a day. Thank you, Mr.\nSpeaker. I yield the well.\nThat completes our afternoon\norders. Mr. Clerk, would you read the\ncaption to a group of privileged\nresolutions?
