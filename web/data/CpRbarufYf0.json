  "transcript": "you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you get into the devotion that COVID testing today is going on until 12.30 pm downstairs. If you have not tested, remember our policy. No test, no admittance. So you got until 12.30 to be tested. We will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the lady from the 56th House District Representative Misha Maynard, representative Maynard. Thank you, Speaker. It's my honor to introduce today Reverend Anthony Motley. Reverend Motley is the senior pastor at Lindsey Street Baptist Church. Lindsey Street Baptist Church has been in existence for 109 years. Its oldest member is mother Savannah Williams. She is 102 years old. The church is located in my district in the English Avenue neighborhood, which is very close to the Mercedes-Benz stadium. Reverend Motley began his journey preaching the Lord's Word, First and Telepusa, Georgia, at Mount Sinai. And then second, he went on to Cedar Town and Rome, Georgia. He has a beautiful daughter by the name of Shanei, a granddaughter named Sanei. And when I asked him, how are things going during COVID? He said that the church has responded beyond his expectation, even more so, glorifying the Lord's name in adversity, without further ado, Reverend Anthony Motley. Speaker, Rostin, my host, representative Misha Maynard, a wonderful legislator who was just simply tailor-made for District 56. She will distinguish her district, herself, her people, this black history in Moth, as a black woman, an African American woman, to all of the members of the black carcass and my dear friends. Many of whom I see with us today, representative Al Williams and others. I've met many of them this morning, whom I've had the pleasure of meeting. Of course, you are, I'm sure proud of your own representative stays Abunds with Nobel Peace Prize people, all of the, my dear legislative friends and to all of the representatives from all over Georgia. I'm sure every district of Georgia, when we, when we turn to pledge allegiance to the flag, we will do so not simply with the mere colors and cloth in mind. But with what, of course, the flag represents and points to and stands for, our allegiance is pledged to the republic for which the flag stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all of her citizens, citizens of the United States of America, across all lines, racial, religious, regional, sexual orientation, national origin, citizens, age, color, creed, citizens. We dare not reduce our allegiance to color and cloth. We belong to something higher, something nobler. We have a higher loyalty. But when does that loyalty, when does our allegiance, our commitment to that higher authority kick in? In his book, a higher loyalty, FBI director James Comey-Sites, the dinner meeting between he and former president where he says he felt pressured, pulled and some kind of an alien power emanating from the president to persuade him not to reaffirm his allegiance to the Constitution, or to the flag or to the Lord for that matter, but to pledge his allegiance to him, to President Trump, I need your loyalty, I expect loyalty, President said to him, by refusing to do so he made himself public enemy number one, was of course relieved of his duties, there comes a time when party politics, and the partisan divides must give way to what Robert Reich and David Hume referred to as the greater good of the common good. It's a time when the nations and legions must shift from democratic and republican party labels, those labels must lose their meaning and decisions must be made based on what's good for the democracy as a whole. On January 6th, we dodged the domestic terroristic bullet, no matter your politics, when the Congress was in the process of certifying the election of Joe Biden as president Kamala Harris as vice president went in a tipped a coup to destroy our democracy and installed a Soviet style dictatorship was attempted and almost succeeded, but for the intercession of our merciful God. Through officer Eugene Goodman and a host of others, we saw some notable persons who answered the call to shift their allegiance to a high authority, and representative Liz Cheney, a conservative conservative, who nonetheless harness the courage to say the president of the United States some of this mob, let the flames of this attack, none of this would have happened without the president. The president could have intervened to stop the violence, he did not, has never been a greater betrayal by President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution, I will vote to him, peace the president. We saw it in our own Secretary of State Brad Raphson Spurger, who's allegiance to a higher loyalty kicked in to overcome the almost unbearable pressure, presidential power to find the desperate command and chief 11,780 votes. One addition of votes to put him over the top, the Secretary of State and manager Gabriel Sterling made the shift to this higher loyalty, vice president Pence, the most loyal of the former president's loyalists, who because he embraced a higher loyalty. We would not disrupt official procedures to do what the Constitution would not permit him to do, who running for his very life, because his boss set him up for the kill, who the mob sought to hang, refused to embrace. The big lie that the former president won the election by landslide, our governor responded in kind, when by the certification of all 50 states, 61 courts, Congress of the United States of America, Joe Biden won 45 laws, all three are passionate conservatives. We're the opponents of Democrats under normal circumstances, but who nonetheless, at that critical historical moment, shifted gears, laid down the garments of partisanship and wrapped themselves in the garb of a patriot in order to save the Republic. We're never cadenies are attempted with that huge image of himself looming over the city of Babylon to force Daniel and the three Hebrew boys to change their allegiance. They pledge to their God and under the threat of death by the red hot fires of the furnace, maintaining their allegiance to Israel God, Israel's God. They responded with these words, we will not bow because our God is able to deliver us. But if he chooses not to deliver us our allegiance, our devotion, our loyalty, our commitment, our ties that bind our hearts in Christian love and the fellowship of Kenton minds that is like to that above won't permit us to bow down to any other gods. Because he said he's a jealous God. We'll have no other gods before and thou shall not bow down to them. He said, and I serve them. I will visit the iniquities of the fathers upon the children, the third and the fourth generation, but we'll show mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments. Our loyalty is to a higher power, a higher authority, a higher deity because he's able to deliver us. He requires full commitment and he rewards the faithful. So when you find yourself standing between the opposing forces of your allegiance to God and the allegiance to men and women legislators, say with Peter, we must obey God. Rather than men, you find yourself between love and hate, choose love, between light and darkness, choose light, between a higher loyalty and a lower one, take the high ground. Between high up or low down, go higher and get seminary's garden Jesus requested the removal of the suffering cup. But when the answer was not in the affirmative, there was a higher loyalty. He responded nevertheless, not my will, but thine be done. Those who are members of Christian churches will be familiar with the words of this old hymn. I'm pressing on the upward way new heights. I'm gaining every day still praying as I own what bound Lord, plant my feet on higher ground. Lord, lift me up and let me stand by faith on heaven's table and a higher plan that I have found Lord, plant my feet on higher ground. My heart has no desire to stay where doubts arise and fears dismay. Those who are made dwell where those are bound Lord, plant my feet on higher ground. Lord, lift me up. Let me stand by faith on heavens table and a higher plan that I have bound Lord, plant my feet on higher ground. Let us pray. For all that you do for us, our Father, which art in heaven, we give you thanks. For your kingdom brought us by Jesus Christ of Nazareth. That will one day come on earth as is in heaven. We give you thanks. In that day when the kingdom of this world shall become kingdoms about God and of his Christ, we shall he shall reign forever.\n\nAnd evermore we give you thanks for our citizenship there because of him your blessings upon this body, these decision-makers, these lawmakers, rest them that they will always do those things that are based on a higher loyalty to a higher power, to a higher God, to a higher deity. In the name of the carpenter of Nazareth, even your son Jesus, we pray for his sake. And it is all safe. Amen. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America. And this is a result of a rich Spanish, one nation under God, who is visible, who is led to a good news, not not to fall in love with him. Doorkeepers will unlock the doors. Thank you.

The recognizes for a morning order, Chairman Bonnie Rich. We're going to have one minute each for morning orders today. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This on the screen is Henry Smith with his grandchildren at our local Welfel House in Swanee for their Christmas morning tradition. Henry was a devoted grandfather and husband and he had a goal to live to 100. He faithfully saw his doctors and took his medicine. He was mentally alert and living well when he became sick and he was hospitalized shortly. Unfortunately, he was separated at the door from his family and he was alone and scared. This once confident World War II veteran began calling his son fearful about what was happening to him. He didn't understand. He wanted his son to come be with him and when that couldn't happen, he asked his son to come get him. On the ride to home, he told his son that this hospital's day was one of the worst things that had ever happened to him. Days later, when he got into trouble, his home nurse pleaded with him to go back to the hospital, but he said he would never go back, that he didn't want to relive what he had experienced before. He chose to stay home and be with his family rather than to seek treatment because he didn't want to be separated from them. The time for this to stop has come. Thank you. Chair recognizes representative Bernal for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. A March 2nd, we will celebrate Dr. Susan's birthday known as Read Across America Day. In honor of that day, I'm asking that each of us record ourselves reading a Dr. Susan's book and send it to the elementary schools in your district to be shared with the students on March 2nd. I am also asking that members in the house celebrate that day by the men wearing red tie or bow tie and the ladies wearing red and white. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes representative Moore for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As we observed President's Day yesterday in the middle of Black History Month, I wanted to share my favorite memory in recent history that combines the two. You see on September 12th, 2019, I watched as 26 members of the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus publish a letter in support of the man who would eventually become the 46th President of the United States. Now remember this was in the middle of a crowded field. There was no clear front runner at the time. And admittedly I'd hitched my wagon to a different candidate. But these 26 members of this legislative body had the wisdom to know that experience matters. The foresight to pick a winner out of a crowded field and the leadership to put their name on the line for the man who had become the leader of our party, our state, and our country. So I want to celebrate these members and thank them for their leadership. Chair recognizes representative Scott for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. From one female veteran to another, I salute you today. We served in the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines, Coast Guard, Army reserves, and National Guard. We fought in all the wars and we are still fighting today. Women veterans in this great state, I salute you today. I had the honor of recognizing Nancy Gail Hemp, Jacqueline Perry, Blade Lock, and Better Turner to all the women veterans in this great state of Georgia. I salute you today. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes representative Scott Field for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am a black woman, although the nation honors black history for one month, I am proud of my history 365 days strong. Today I present Alice Coachman. Alice Coachman became the first black woman from any country to win a gold medal in track and field. Coachman had come from a poor background in Albany, Georgia, and due to segregation, she was restricted, had restricted access to top quality training facilities and was also often denied the opportunity to train for or compete in organized sporting events. However, that didn't stop her from continuing to develop her strengths and talents. Coachman ran barefoot on dirt roads and used old equipment to train. Then she was taken under the wing of the boys track coach at Madison High School, Harry E. Lash, who recognized her talents. She broke high school and college AAU track records for track and field barefoot. In 1939, she received a scholarship at the age of 16 to Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee, Alabama. As she continued to dominate the AAU competitions, in 1946, she enrolled in Albany State College. She won the national champion in the 50 and 100 meters races as well as the 400 meter relay and high jump. Despite her back industry, engineering, Coachman set a record for the high jump with a mark of five feet, six and one eighth inches, making her the first black women to win an Olympic gold medal. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I leave you with this word that she said, her quote is, and I grabbed it to my heart. I paid the way for them all. Alice Coachman. Thank you. Chair recognizes representative Derek Jackson for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Founded 112 years ago on February 12, 1909, the National Association for Advancement of Color People was formed. It is the nation's foremost largest and most widely recognized civil rights organization. It has over 500,000 members and supporters, and this organization continues to fight the good fight to ensure that this true aim that it was created for. And it was created for all people, the rights guaranteed in the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments to the United States Constitution, which promised to end to slavery and the equal protection under law, under the law. The NAACP is a great example when we all come together. Nearly 60 Americans came together, whites and blacks to fight a common cause. And that is a true moment of black history. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We had one more member who had signed up for a morning order. Representative Hopson, she's waived. We are now going on to the rules calendar. Going on to the rules calendar. Mark will read the caption to House Bill 146. House Bill 146 by members of the Gaines, the 17th Cooper, the 43rd, and others to be entitled to amend Article 20 and Title 45. The fiscal to George annotated relaying the general provisions regarding personnel administration. So it's a provide for paid parental leave for eligible state employees. This bill ever referred to the Committee on Health and Human Services. The Committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes representative Houston Gaines to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I bring before you this morning House Bill 146, which is a piece of legislation that this House passed 164 to one last year. And so everybody in this body who was here last year voted for it because the one is no longer with us. So I just want to ask for your support on three weeks of paid parental leave for state employees who apply upon birth adoption or foster care placement for full-time state employees. This is something that President Trump and Ivanka Trump have led on at the federal level, including 12 weeks of paid leave for federal employees. And so we feel like this is a positive step forward for our state, Mr. Speaker. I want to thank you for your leadership on this issue in particular. So happy to answer any questions and would appreciate this body's continued bipartisan support of this measure. Any questions? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the will.

This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 93. House Bill 93 by motion of Cooper, the 43rd to be entitled back to amend Title 31 of the fiscal to George Anatetti relating to health. The Chair goes to eliminate duplicative state licensure and regulation of clinical laboratories as bill ever further the Committee on Health and Human Services. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by Committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Cooper to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I bring to you the Committee's substitute to House Bill 93. We have the federal government regulates labs in our state. But for 4% of our labs, our state bureaucracy has added even higher regulations on them. And so this makes it an even playing field by saying that all our labs will be regulated by the federal standard and the federal regulatory system. In the state, they will still have to report any infections diseases to the state and the state can step in if they are not following federal guidelines. That is the essence of the bill and I would appreciate your positive vote on this measure. And if there are no questions, Mr. Speaker, I will yield the well. You do not have any questions. Thank you, sir. I yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair hears none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee's substitute? The Chair hears none. The Committee's substitute is adopted.

Have all members voted? So the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 93. The eyes are 161, the nays or zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 254. House Bill 254, Representative Lomston of the 12th and others being tied on knack to a menarch on 1 on chapter 23, a title 33 of the fiscal to George Anaceta relating the licensing of agencies, sub-agents, counselors, and adjusters. This bill I refer to the Committee on Insurance Committee recommends that this bill do pass by Committee substitute. Chair recognizes the Chair of the House Insurance Committee. Chairman Lomston to present the bill. Reporting Mr. Speaker, members of the House, I bring to you House Bill 254. This is a department bill that comes as a priority request from the insurance commissioner. House Bill 254 addresses the laws governing the operation of public adjusters in our state. Whenever an insured person files a claim for a law, an insurance adjuster is involved in investigating and coordinating settlement of the claims. Larger companies may use a company adjuster while smaller companies often use a public adjuster. In a natural disaster such as a hurricane or tornado, public adjusters play an important role for many people. Most public adjusters are professional and perform a valuable service in helping those who have suffered loss to obtain repairs and coordinate settlement of their claim. However public adjusters are one of the most consistent sources of consumer fraud. The Georgia Department of Insurance deals with every year, costing consumers millions of dollars. The majority of this fraud is aimed at the elderly, the disabled, or those who are in the most need after a natural disaster. This has been a common problem in most coastal states for many years because like Georgia, they deal with natural disasters and have laws governing the operation of public adjusters that are broad and lacking in specifics. House Bill 254 changes Georgia's public adjuster law to align with similar changes made in Florida as well as Texas, both states that deal with natural disasters and public adjusters. The changes include new licensing requirements, higher standards of conduct, introduces new consumer protections, governs how a public adjuster can present themselves, requires the use of department-approved contracts, specifically bans the public adjusters from serving in multiple capacities, specifically from serving as a contractor as well as the appraiser. It gives the department the authority to adopt rules and regulations necessary to implement this legislation. Mr. Speaker, that is the bill. I'll be glad to answer any questions if there are any. I would appreciate your favorable consideration. You do not have any questions. Thank you. I yield the web. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of House Bill 254 will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. The clerk will have all members voted if so. The clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 254. The eyes are 160. The nays are three. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 200. House Bill 200 by Representative Powell, 32nd to be entitled to amend Title 40. The official go to Georgia and attend every lady, motor vehicles and traffic. Associate of the provide for the issuance of the Class C driver's license to operators for certain three-wheeled motor vehicles. This bill ever referred to the committee on motor vehicles. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes Chairman Allen Powell to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House. You heard about simple bells. This is one that we continue to have to bring up every so many years. Technology that has changed so many of the types of vehicles we deal with back a few years ago because of the driver's license classification. We had to redefine the difference in a three-wheeled motorcycle and a three-wheeled vehicle. We did this a few years ago with that certain definition. Now the changes have been made in these three-wheeled vehicles a little bit more. What we've done is that we have changed the definitions on the driver's license classification and it clarifies the difference between a three-wheel motorcycle and a three-wheel motor vehicle. Excuse me. That was my ex calling me. You want me to take that call for you? No, sir. But if you look on lines 1837 and 45, the definition we've given is that if these vehicles have seat belts in a frame, departure, or fully enclosed, the operator, then these would be considered a three-wheeled vehicle. Thus, they would be exempt from the seat belt in goggles. Mr. Speaker, that's quite simply, I said, as a simple bell, and that's what it is. And I would appreciate your favorable consideration. I'll be glad to answer any questions if there are any. You have some questions. Did you yield? I will, sir. Chair recognizes Chairman Petrie to your left for a question. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, sir. Can you tell us, sir, which ex was it that was calling you? That was the original. You have some coastal confusion, Mr. Chairman. Chair recognizes Representative Al Williams to your left for a question. I could assure you I've never had an ex from that in coastal Georgia. Gentlemen, yield? Yes, sir. There's still time. But I assure you so far, we're kind of happy about that. Very seriously, you know, there might be multiple. What does the current ladies' ex think about the bill? I'm sorry, what does what? Your ladies' ex, not from the coast. Think about your bill. And does she ride three wheels? There's a few of them with mine. What I rode as long as I rode the right thing. Mr. Speaker, this is pretty well self-explanatory bill, and I would certainly appreciate your favorable consideration. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair hears none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair hears none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machines. All members voted. Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 200. The eyes are 128, the nays are 35. This bill, having received the requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed.

So as a reminder, electronic submission of certain documentation required of manufacturers, distributors, dealers, secretary, and recyclingers, use motor vehicle parts, dealers, and scrap mental processors. This bill, having further committee on motor vehicles, I've committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Corbett to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, I'll bring before you House Bill 207, LC 392861S. With the new drive system that Department of Revenue has, documents that previously had to be mailed in, can now be filed electronically, which is easier and more cost effective for the business community. And it brings the state up to date with the way business is being done today. Basic section one of the bill provides that manufacturers, distributors, dealers, engage in the manufacturer's sale, or at least in the vehicle's shower, file this registration electronically, section two of the bill, anyone that cancels a certificate of title where there'd be a scrap mental dealer or an insurance company where they've told the car, that shall be filed electronically. Then the third section of the bill deals with when a court ordered sale, either be it from a repair facility or a tow truck that towed it in and it's been abandoned.\n\nThey have to submit a bill of sale to the Department of Revenue and this shall be done electronically.
