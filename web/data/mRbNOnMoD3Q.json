serve our Middle Georgia area\nas Representatives thank you for your\nsupport of the ongoing mission of Robins\nAir Force Base a great economic engine\nfor our entire State and especially\nMiddle Georgia and a vital point for the\nsecurity and peace of our nation and\nworld I live so close to the base that\nevery morning I hear I hear Reveille\nevery afternoon the national anthem and\nevery evening at 10 o'clock taps and\nthose are the sounds of freedom and also\nthe sacrifice that makes that freedom\npossible\nI want to give a special greeting to one\nof our keepers of the door today Tom\nBrown\nis here and at the back door and he is\nuh the older brother of my\nbrother-in-law Paul and I wanted to\nmention that and he and his wife Betty\nare here today\nand to all of you in the house thank you\nfor your labors of love and and\nsacrifice and all that you do to keep\nGeorgia growing the United States and\nthe world we collectively impact it's a\nvery special honor to be with you today\nI wanted to read from Exodus 15 verses\n22-25 then Moses LED Israel from the Red\nSea and they went out into the desert\nashore for three days they traveled into\nthe desert without finding water when\nthey came to Mara they could not drink\nits water because it was bitter that is\nwhy the place is called Mara\nso the people grumbled against Moses\nsaying what are we to drink then Moses\ncried out to the Lord and the Lord\nshowed him a piece of wood and he threw\nthat wood into the water and the water\nbecame sweet\nyou know the setting of that text is not\nunlike the world in which we live and\nthe sphere of influence in which you\nwere called to operate in this house\nthe children of Israel had just come off\na mighty victory in Egypt but only three\ndays out into their Journey their\nattitude was what have you done for me\nlately\nwhether in the church or in the state we\ndo serve people but on any given day we\nmay hear the people Grumble and if it\ninvolves something essential the\ngrumbling can escalate into a bitter\nchorus of complaining and blaming\nI think we're living\nin some of the most bitter times in our\nnation and in our world what can we do\nto make those better well enter Moses\nyou know Moses was a a great leader but\neven great leaders can get frustrated\nmy oldest granddaughter Olivia loves to\ntell me jokes and stumped me with\nriddles and last week she asked me this\nquestion who is the greatest sinner in\nthe Bible\nthat's in my wheelhouse I thought I\nshould know that my thoughts quickly\nwent from the Old Testament Jezebel to\nthe New Testament Judas but her answer\nwas Moses\nand I asked her why and she said because\nPapa he broke all the Commandments\n[Music]\nand indeed\nwhen he came down off that mount\nwith the law of God codified in stone\nand he saw what the people were doing in\nhis absence he became angry and\nfrustrated and threw those on the ground\nfiguratively breaking every law you know\nI think that's a parable for our times\nwe're hearing and seeing lived out a lot\nof bitterness not just because of\nessential needs not being met\nbut essential laws that are not being\nkept\nwhen we hear and read again about gun\nviolence and mass shootings it seems\nwe've forgotten a simple law you shall\nnot kill or more accurately you shall\nnot murder in watching the\ndisintegration of the family we've\nforgotten honor your father and your\nmother truth has become even more of a\nrare commodity because we've forgotten\nand not understood the words you shall\nnot lie and you shall not bear false\nwitness against your neighbor\nand whether it involves a petty theft or\nthe violation of the boundaries of a\nSovereign Nation we have forgotten laws\nlike you shall not steal and you shall\nnot covet what belongs to your neighbor\nwe must revisit these shattered laws and\nreteach them to our children that the\nNext Generation May understand the\ndifference between right and wrong but\nwhere do we start you know when I look\nat Moses in our text today the first\nthing he did was cry out to God\nhe prayed\nand prayer is always essential thank you\nfor having this time of prayer and\ndevotion every day when you meet in\nJeremiah 33 3 God says call upon me and\nI will show you Great and Mighty things\nyou know not of\nwithin our story Moses calls upon the\nLord he prays and the Lord shows him\nsomething great just a piece of wood\nand he took that piece of wood and he\nthrew it in the waters and the waters\nbecame sweet and the people could drink\nI think a point is in facing the\nbitterness of our times if we pray\nGod will show us something close at hand\nsomething within our reach to take in\nhand and help turn bitter Waters sweet\nagain in our society\nmaybe it's uh kind words spoken or\nwritten acts of kindness or a hand\nthat's reached across this aisle or\nmaybe across an ocean in cooperation\nit may become your life's work\nI'm going to mention someone today who's\non all of our minds and his former U.S\npresident and former governor of our\nstate Jimmy Carter you know he's kind of\nlike a Moses figure in our state and\nreally in our nation Jimmy Carter became\npresident at one of the most bitter\ntimes in our nation's history and it did\ninvolve water Watergate\nand for a short season President Carter\nentered into the bitter Waters of our\nnation at that time and helped us turn\nthe page from that bitterness and make\nthings sweet again\nduring his presidency like Moses he had\nand he was an intermediary between Egypt\nand Israel helping to uh broker a piece\nat Camp David of course we know the last\ncouple of years of his term of service\nwas filled with domestic and\ninternational crisis and it engulfed the\nlatter part of his presidency and he\nsuffered a very bitter defeat for\nre-election and then going home to\nplanes he found the family business in\ntatters it was a bitter time\nbut being a man of faith\nJimmy Carter cried out to God and God\nshowed him a piece of wood\nJimmy Carter is a wonderful Carpenter\nand God transformed his avocation as a\ncarpenter into an ambassador for Habitat\nfor Humanity building homes for the\nhomeless\nand this is only the beginning of the\nmost prolific post-lude in United States\npresidency which included a Nobel Peace\nPrize Jimmy Carter\nis a wonderful example of someone who\ncould enter the most bitter of waters\nand make them better and we're praying\nfor president and Mrs Carter amen\nin what appeared to be his last days\nunder hospice care may they be sweet\nindeed\nbut in closing let us be reminded of\nanother Carpenter whose initials are JC\nJesus Christ entered into the bitter\nWaters of this sinful world two thousand\nyears ago he came to embody and live out\nthe very laws of God that God gave us\nand after three years of Earthly\nMinistry he cried out in the Garden of\nGethsemane and God showed him a piece of\nwood\na tree\nan Old Rugged Cross\nand facing that bitter cup\nJesus said not my will but thine be done\nand in this season of Lent let us be\nreminded of his sacrifice his blood shed\nfor us his life given for us that the\nbitterness of sin but might be removed\nand we might be forgiven\nand just as the Israelites were three\ndays in the desert Jesus was three days\nin the Tomb\nbut he rose victoriously over death that\nwe may experience the Living Water of\nabundant life on Earth and eternal life\nin heaven in the Sweet By and By Jesus\nis the ultimate example of turning\nsomething bitter into something better\nand sweeter and that is why in the words\nof the hymn writer Jesus is the sweetest\nname I know\nand he's just the same\nas his lovely name and that's the reason\nwhy I love him so for Jesus is the\nsweetest name I know\nwould you join me in prayer\ndear heavenly father I thank you for the\nopportunity to speak to this\nrepresentative body for our state\n180 seats filled with strong men and\nwomen\nbless them as they often serve against a\nbackdrop of bitter complaining and\nblaming\nyet help them to know that it is within\ntheir reach to say something and do\nsomething positive to transform bitter\nWaters and make them better if not sweet\nand help them to know that their\nCollective potential to empower our\nstate and even our nation to do a 180.\nand turn the people away from bitterness\nand division toward goals that make us\nall better\nand we do thank you today for President\nJimmy Carter and his precious wife\nRosalind and their family as they count\ndown precious final days together may\nyou comfort them and help them to know\nof our love\nLord bless our great state of Georgia\nand God please bless these United States\nof America in the sweet name of Jesus I\ndo pray it\namen\nI pledge allegiance\nof the United\nRepublic for which it stands one nation\nunder God indivisible with liberty and\njustice for all\ngreat job great job wow\nthank you Pastor

a\nmuch needed incentive to recruit and\nretain medical examiners to the state of\nGeorgia\ncurrently the state is staffed with nine\nfull-time medical examiners two\npart-time serving a population of almost\n11 million people\nthis is impacting every community in our\nstate\nmany of us have received calls asking\nfor help of some kind in resolving this\nissue\nthese nine Georgia Pathologists are\ncarrying an overloaded caseload because\nof the shortage this is not just a\nGeorgia problem this is a national\nproblem\nthe governor and the Georgia legislature\nare now working together on

any questions\nyou do have a question if the gentleman\nyields generally else\nrepresenting Byrd from the 20th right\nout in front of you has a question\nrepresentative Byrd\nthank you very much this is gentleman\nyield Jimmy yields is it not true all\nstudent loan forgiveness is paid by\ntaxpayer money\nthat is true if the lady so States but\nit's also this this loan repayment is an\ninvestment back in our medical examiners\nit's not it's kind of a bonus that that\nstair stepped over five years that they\nhave to stay here and complete those\nfive years to be able to get the fleet\namount\nand is it not excuse me for the yield\nand is it not true that everyone outside\nthis gold Dome who has student debt\nwould like forgiveness as well if the\nlady feels oh thank you\ngentlemen yield for a question from\nchairman\nBill Hitchens to your left\nwell gentleman yield yes sir is it not\ntrue that uh in Georgia now we have no\nforensic Pathologists in Macon or\nSavannah and we're we're direly short\nand it it inhibits the criminal justice\nsystem for moving forward when you can't\nget the evidence you know not only\ninhibits that but it also hurts these\nfamilies they're waiting on their loved\nones to get back because the time that\nit takes from traveling from Savannah\nfrom Valdosta and the cost to those\ncommunities we refer to you yes sir is\nit not true that there are over a\nthousand medical examiner positions in\nthis United States and there are only\n500 certified forensic pathologists that\nis true\nthank you thank you gentlemen yield for\na couple more yes sir\nthe gentleman from the 172nd he's been\nhere a short time but he's uh has some\npretty good questions\nChase cannons recognized for a question\nthank you Mr Speaker does the gentleman\nyield generally yes is it not true the\ncounty coroners and the southern part of\nthe state have to drive or spend one or\ntwo days or three days\ntransporting bodies to Atlanta rather\nthan to make it\nas gentleman States yes is it further\nnot true does the gentleman yield yes\nfurther not true that this this bill\nwould potentially lower the cost for\nCounty coroners uh exponentially\nthe gentleman knows what he speaks\ngentlemen yield to representative Al\nWilliams right out in front of you\nrepresentative Williams The Man From\nMidway yes sir for the gentleman yield\nyes sir is it not true that an\ninvestment of this nature would return\ngreatly\nthe Forgiveness that's given\nthe gentleman knows what he speaks is it\nnot further true that many times the\nhuge delays and funerals and it's very\ndifficult because we've not been able to\nget the information needed back from the\nmedical examiners and it's a desperate\nsituation and we certainly can't put a\ndollar amount on this you're so correct\nsir for your community it's it's good\ndoing this is going to change everything\nin the state of Georgia and recruit and\nretain these these medical examiners\nlet's hear a question from the gentleman\nthe chairman from which this issue arose\nrepresentative Martin has a question\ngentleman yield for a question yes sir\nisn't it true while this does uh involve\nloan repayment the state is getting a\nvalue for in in exchange for that yes\nsir Jim know what he speaks for the\nyield yes sir isn't it true that that's\nquite a bit different from a blanket\nloan repayment just because I went into\ndebt you owe us the money that is true\nsir it is for the Yale yes sir isn't it\nfurther true that the governor's plan to\ndo this and make it a loan repayment has\nthe money go straight to the loan\nrepayment rather than paying it to the\nmedical examiner so one couldn't take\nthat money and do something else and\nstill claim I have debt this is a direct\nrepayment for Val isn't it true this is\na direct repayment for Value to the\ntaxpayers of Georgia and is an\ninvestment into this uh profession so\nthat Georgians can be better served that\nis true and that's why it's going to\nthis Georgia student finance committee\nso that that doesn't happen in this\nthese loans and or paid back and\nprotected\nwe have another speaker on this subject\na couple of questions out there but um I\nsaw the questions right now for you Mr\nFloor leader so so uh we'll move on to\nanother speaker if you were if you will\nyield the well Jim

sewing he was a\ngraduate of scared and was a designer\nthe only reason that we found out who\nshot my grand nephew was because the\nyoung man that took the car\nwas caught trying to change the plates\non the car but we thank God that he's in\njail\nit took us\ntwo weeks\ntwo weeks before we could get a coroner\ntwo weeks because they were not\navailable\nnot only that they had to take the

review of\nAssessments and appeals this bill\nhaven't referred to the committee on\nways and means that committee recommends\nthat this bill do pass by committee\nsubstitute\nrepresentative Vance Smith\nis recognized to present the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker\nladies and gentlemen House Bill 264\ndeals with taxpayers when they have an\nappeal process on their property tax\nworking with the tax assessors and the\nclerks if you look at section two first\nall the way through the bill worked on\nall of those items the dates how many\ndays you're allowed is a 180 day period\nsome of the dates in there have been\nadjusted to try to equalize and\nadequately appoint that time for the tax\nassessor's office and clerks and Board\nof Equalization there's a the section\nnumber one\nit was an addition so that's the reason\nyou have a substitute but if you looked\nat line 241 through 246 if if there's no\nhearing officer or they don't get a\nhearing schedule doing the required time\nthen that section one\nitem c will take effect and if you look\nat that it will give a stipulation that\nthey will the taxes on the property\npresently will remain there successive\nfor two years there are three exceptions\nif they uh taxpayer has a valuation on\ntheir return that's higher or different\nor if the tax assessor goes out and\non-site visit looks at the property and\nsees that there's been an addition\ndeletions to the property on\nimprovements to the property or if the\ntaxpayer himself presents evidence to\nchange that whether it goes up or down\nso that's basically your bill I think\nthis will help the tax payers or speed\nthat process up by adequately adjusting\nthat time and I would certainly ask for\nyour favorable consideration thank you\nMr Speaker there are no questions I'll\nheal the will\nthe gentleman yields he has a question\nto your left yes certainly Jasmine Clark\nhas a question yes ma'am thank you Mr\nSpeaker this is gentleman yield yes\nma'am so um on in section two you say\nthat we're equalizing the time\num but it shows that we're actually\ndecreasing the amount of time that the\ncounty has to I guess reach out to or\ncorrect changes by half\nhow are larger counties like Gwinnett\nand Fulton how do you think this might\naffect them as they might have more on\ntheir plate than maybe some of our\nsmaller counties\nI think an equalizing that time and\nthere again the tax assessors and the\nclerks work together\nhand in hand on section two which that's\nwhat you're talking about\nbut in some instances as I was\nexplaining some the tax assessors might\nuse of that 180 day period they might\nuse 130 140 days therefore leaving the\nhearing officer or maybe a clerk of\ncourt that lasts remaining 50 40 or 50\ndays so we're trying to make it even so\nthat they get as much time for the\nhearing part as the tax assessors do um\nand uh this gentleman for the yield yes\nma'am um also I think in the same\nsection\nand line 104 where we change the\nrequirement for them to set a date for\nhearing to them holding a hearing again\nmy concern is for the larger counties\nnow making it mandatory that they get\num\nan actual hearing done in this amount of\ntime have you spoken to any of these\nlarger counties to see how they feel\nthis might affect their ability to just\ndo their job yes ma'am thank you for the\nquestion there again the tax assessors\nthere was a meeting here at the Capitol\na few weeks ago and they sat down with\nthe clerks and they they worked out that\nwhole section too and they were all in\nagreement now I'm not going to say\neverybody in the whole State's\nabsolutely satisfied because I don't\nknow if we ever get Perfection but they\nagree to those date changes\nyes ma'am thank you representative Smith\nwill you yield for another question yes\nsir\nWhit burchett right in front of you has\na question if you'll yield\nthank you Mr Speaker uh thank you for\nbringing the bill representative Smith\njust to for clarity's purposes\num isn't it true that 180 days is still\nthere it's just separated between the\nBoard of Equalization and the uh the\nfirst first portion of the appeal\ncorrect yes sir so you still got 180\ndays it's just uh which board has to act\nunder those 90 days and then\num isn't it also true that where before\nthe Board of Equalization had 15 days to\nset a date now they have 90 days to hold\na hearing that was the that was the\nchange that\num in that section isn't that true\nabsolutely yes sir thank you mister I\nappreciate that thanks for bringing the\nbill\nand that was on actually on line 103 it\nwent from 15 days to 90 days\nif no further questions from the speaker\nI'd ask you a favorable consideration on\nHouse Bill 264.\nthe gentleman has yielded the well

16 and the official quoted\nGeorge annotated relating to crimes and\noffenses so survived for the offense\nof criminal interference with critical\ninfrastructure this bill ever referred\nto the committee on Judiciary non-civil\nthat committee recommends that this bill\ndo pass\nby committee substitute\nchair recognizes representative leverage\nto present the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker ladies and\ngentlemen house I'm pleased today to\nbring to you house bill 227 a bill that\naddresses a very timely topic of concern\nto all of us\nI'm sure you all saw with me on the news\nback during the December around the\nholiday period when somebody is yet\nunknown damaged a power substation in\nNorth Carolina and plunged about 45 000\npeople into absolute darkness and cold\nduring one of the coldest times or cold\nspells that I remember in my life\nwell that's not the only time that's\nhappening these days it's becoming more\nfrequent all over the country apparently\nsome people have decided that it's open\nseason on critical infrastructure in our\nyou for our utilities and they're using\nthat\num for whatever reason\nwe currently have some tools to deal\nwith that kind of conduct we have\ncriminal damage to property statutes and\nwe also have domestic terrorism\nbut of course not everybody does this\nwith an intent to be terrorism\nterroristic to everyone there are times\nwhen it's just simple damage and we\ndon't really know for example in North\nCarolina if that was just two people\nseeing who was the better shot and could\nhit the shiny thing in the substation\nwith our shotgun or if it was truly\nsomeone trying to call commit an act of\ndomestic Terror so House Bill 227\nwould address these issues by allowing\nprosecutors a mid-range charge right now\ndomestic terrorism of course requires a\nlot of proof elements with respect to uh\nyour your state of mind and your intent\nyour purpose\num domestic the criminal damage to\nproperty statute does not require that\nbut it only has a penalty up to 10 years\nso we're amending in House Bill 227 the\ncriminal damage to property statute and\nadding some additional elements if you\ncan show that the damage to the property\ninvolved critical infrastructure or\nvital services and it was done\nintentionally by force or violence or if\nit was done to electronic infrastructure\nby electronic means then that that\nconstitutes a special category of\ncriminal damage to property and first\ndegree and can be punished by an\nadditional 10 years it's two to twenty\nyears as a penalty so that's what the\nbill does and I feel like this is\nnecessary at this point to send a\nmessage to those who would try to damage\nvital infrastructure which can have such\na more far-ranging impact than just\nsimply damaging a piece of property if\nyou if you damage the utilities\num you know truck Depot well that's\nthat's that's bad but that generally\nisn't going to put 45 000 people in the\ndark and absolute cold during right the\nweek before Christmas so this would\nwould give prosecutors an additional\ntool in their toolbox if you will and\nallow them to make a charge that has a\npenalty that's commensurate with the\nscope and breadth of the impact these\nkinds of crimes have I think you may\nnotice on your desk there are quite a\nnumber of organizations the Georgia\nChamber supports the uh this this\nlegislation as does a a wide group of\nutility companies who are concerned\nabout this very alarming Trend and we\nhope this will help send a message to\nfolks that might be contemplating that\nthat they don't should not do it and for\nthose who committed and aren't deterred\nwe can punish them to a degree that's\ncommensurate with the impact and the\nharm they're causing to our citizens so\nthis will protect we believe this will\nprotect Georgia Citizens from these\nkinds of Acts and will help deter them\nso that's that's the bill uh Mr Speaker\nI'll yield for any questions\ngentlemen yields for questions the chair\nrecognizes representative Kennard to\nyour left for a question\nthis is gentleman yield I yield yes sir\nhas there been any been any incidents\nlike this in Georgia today I'm not aware\nthat there have been any yet but I\nsuppose my my goal is let's let's not\nwait for a few of them to happen let's\ntry to be proactive and prevent them now\ndo you further yield yes sir so an 18 19\nyear old that accidentally hits a\ncritical piece of infrastructure just\nshooting their gun what happens to them\nwell it's unintentional well if it's\nunintentional the the bill does require\nsome kind of intent or intentionality\nwith that with the act so I don't\nbelieve that would fall under this this\nparticular crime it might fall under\nsome others but not under this one thank\nyou thank you for that question\nrepresentative Earhart is recognized for\na question straight in front of you to\nthe back thank you representative we\nyield for a question yes ma'am is it not\ntrue that Georgia is an amazing place to\nlive and the number one state in the\nnation to do business\nyes ma'am I would agree wholeheartedly\nwill you further yield I will yield for\nthose this is a piece of legislation\nthat will provide a much needed extra\nlevel of deterrent to protect this\namazing state that we live in and to\nprotect our citizens that is certainly\nour intent yes ma'am thank you thank you\nfor the question\nrepresentative Collins chairman Collins\nis recognized for a question if you will\nyield for one yes sir\ngentleman Neil yes sir absolutely is it\nnot true that throughout this state you\nknow there have been a lot of folks over\nthe years who have probably went on\npower lines and went mudding and went\nthrough the four-wheel drives and do\nthat kind of thing and it's not true\nthat this bill does a lot to discourage\nthat type of behavior and hold some\npeople more accountable for Reckless\nBehavior Uh with with this type of\nissues where you have people that might\nbe on a on a power line and they got\nguns and they're shooting and and they\ndo damage to this type of critical\ninfrastructures it's not true that this\nbill is going to help discourage that\ntype of behavior throughout this state\nwell I certainly hope it will\num and I think the degree of\nintentionality that would require that\nwould suffice the support of prosecution\nwill have to be determined in each\ncircumstance based on those facts but I\ncertainly hope it will discourage any\nkind of Reckless Behavior and certainly\nintentional behavior that would would\ndamage that infrastructure\nyield for a couple of more questions I'm\nI'm trying not to Mr Speaker but I will\nyeah if you don't mind take a couple\nmore representative Tran has a question\nto your left\nthank you Mr Speaker that's the\ngentleman yield I do yes sir so as the\nowner of a cafe in a shopping center\num I'm wondering critical infrastructure\nif the bar in the shopping center couple\ndrunks get really drunk and they're\npissed off at the bar owner and they\nknock out the Transformer and takes out\nthe entire shopping center would that be\npart of critical infrastructure well\num Mr representative to me the bar would\nbe critical infrastructure\nbut I'm not sure it was not your\nquestion\nI'd be willing to accept that as\ncritical infrastructure no in all\nseriousness I\ngiven my personal preferences the\ndefinition would not include the bar and\nI believe again that it would get back\nto the degree of intent\num and frankly I don't profess to have\nenough knowledge of criminal law and\nintent in in Maine Sharia to know but I\nthink if you are\ndrunk and commit an act like this you\nprobably wouldn't have the requisite\ndegree of intent but again I think it\ndepends on the totality of circumstances\nthank you sir\nand I look forward to visiting your Cafe\nand trying out the other businesses in\nthe vicinity sometime soon sounds good\nif the gentleman will take one more\nquestion that would be awesome Mr\nSpeaker I would be delighted to do that\nrepresentative Maynor is recognized for\na question thank you Mr Speaker does the\ngentleman yield yeah I yield yes ma'am\nfor the pleasure of the body I would\njust like to point out that this is a\nminimum of two years sentencing for\narsene of a police car it's a minimum of\nfive years sentencing for\ntwo or more people to do a riot it's a\nminimum of five years sentencing and\naggravated assault with the attempt\nintent or attempt to rape\nis one year if this body please\nrecognize that\nthank you thank you\nyou have one last question and it's\nrepresentative donohoo over to your left\nthe gentleman from the 31st\nthere's a gentleman yield I yield is it\nnot true the worst whipping I think I\never had when I was 12 years old I took\na 12 gauge shotgun I shot the power line\nto control the telephone to my house\nluckily my father worked for Southern\nBelle and could fix that\nbut this builds a great bill because\nwith ill intentions we can hurt a lot of\npeople and I think it's very much needed\nthank you thank you and I'm I'm sure the\nrepresentatives whipping was much worse\nthan two years in any any state\nInstitution\nif the gentleman will yield I said one\nmore but this one's um I think this\none's important as well chairman Martin\nto your right is recognized for a\nquestion\nyou may have mentioned that but I want\nto highlight it again if I may on line\n36 of the bill you add electronic means\nisn't that true yes and isn't it true\nthat we we found nationally and\ninternationally that's one of the\nbiggest vulnerabilities to our critical\ninfrastructure is cyber intrusion that\ncan take out not only forty thousand\npeople not a hundred thousand people but\ncould it potentially take out half of\nthe United States because of the\ninterconnection between the electric\ngrid and your address and that in the\nbill and if for no other reason isn't it\ntrue that's a great Improvement for the\nprotection of our citizens in Georgia\nThank You chairman Martin I would agree\nwholeheartedly and I wish I could claim\ncredit for that great idea it was\nbrought to me after we filed the bill\nbut it seemed like such a good idea we\ncouldn't resist it so we did include\nthat in the in the bill that's before\nyou today for your approval thank you\nfor that question\ndone a good job all right if I have no\nfurther questions Mr Speaker I will\nyield the well and ask your favorable\nconsideration of house bill 227.\nthe gentleman has yielded the well is\nthere any objection to the previous\nquestion being ordered the chair hears\nnone the previous question

that\ndove hunting is one of the favor\npastimes in the state of Georgia\nI've heard that isn't it also true that\nthis bill would help some of my friends\nin south Georgia that can't hit them\nflying

relating to restraining orders\nand protective orders so to provide for\nthe issuance of a temporary or permanent\nprotective order by the court\ndisability refer to the committee on\njudiciary non-civil that committee\nrecommends that this bill do pass\nrepresentative Franklin from down in\nStatesboro is recognized to present the\nbill\nthank you Mr Speaker\nthis bill is to amend the code relating\nto protective orders in regards to\nstalking it basically gives the judges\nthe discretion at the time of its\nordering\nto allow it to be temporary or permanent\nat that time\nand that is basically all that is to the\nbill but I tell you as I started looking\ninto this I had no idea the frustrating\nthe frustrations surrounding this issue\nand I've come to learn that many people\nor many of us in this chamber have\nactually dealt with it and if you\nhaven't dealt with it personally you\nmore than likely know somebody that's\ndealt with this issue\num\nso I feel like it's time that we do\nsomething about it stalking in its core\nmanifests itself in intimidation control\nand fear\num\nand I think we could all agree in this\nchamber that there's no place for that\nin Georgia so as for your considerable\nfavorable consideration on this bill and\nI yield for any questions you may have\ngentlemen yields for questions\nrepresentative Kendrick to your left is\nrecognized for a

minutes so let's um let's move\non and give your attention\nto uh HB 273 the clerk will read the\ncaption House Bill 273 by representative\nDeLoach the 167th to be entitled knack\nto amend article one of chapter 2 title\n12 of the official to Georgia annotated\nrelating to General Provisions relative\nto Department of Natural Resources so\nit's extend the date by which rules and\nregulations prescribed by the board of\nNatural Resources must be in effect for\npurposing purpose of establishing\ncriminal violations\nthis building refer to the committee on\nnatural resources environment that\ncommittee recommends that this bill do\npass\nmembers this bill was on yesterday's\ncalendar\nand we postponed until today and the\ngentleman is patiently waited to present\nthe bill\nchairman DeLoach is recognized to\npresent the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker this mic was up\npretty high I don't know it was here\nbefore me but it must have been pretty\ntold\nthis is a Natural Resources Department\nof Natural Resources Bill section one\nsimply moves forward the date from\nJanuary 1 2022 to January 1 2023 so the\ndepartment can continue to enforce their\nrules and regulations the section 2\ndeals with the cephalo island Heritage\nAuthority it's simply\nchanges the makeup of the authority very\nslightly\nit allows the gut the governor currently\nserves and it allows the governor or his\nor her designee to serve\non the board the commissioner continues\nto serve on the board the executive\ndirector of State Properties commission\ncontinues to serve\nformerly the commission on human\nrelations in the governor's office had a\nseat and that Commission on human\nrelations in the governor's office has\ngone away so we take that seat and give\nit to a resident of the hog hammock\ncommunity on Sapelo Islands so they now\nhave two residents serving the only\nother thing this bill does\nis removes the governor as the chairman\nof the authority and he becomes the vice\nchairman and the commissioner of Natural\nResources becomes the chair with that Mr\nSpeaker I'm on yield of well and go to\nlunch\nyou're a smart man but we do have a\nspeaker\nto assist you before you go to lunch\nchair recognizes representative Al\nWilliams to speak to the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker\nand I certainly thank the author for\nthis bill\non saplo Island\nhog Hammett\nis the last remaining\ngullage\nin the entire United States\nfor many many years the residents there\nhave been able\nto identify themselves with a direct\nlineage to the west coast of Africa\nmany many good things have happened\nthat's why it is a beautiful pristine\nplace\nand the reason for this bill and the\nreason for the commissioner becoming a\nchairman as as the as the author said is\nbecause the governor is just not able to\nmeet often enough\nbecause of other responsibilities and\nthe commissioner and we have several\nRangers over there is able to do this\nand the people over there need to be\nheard\nthere are many things they need\nand and as you know by our bill that has\nbeen introduced also by the author\nMcIntosh County is economically a very\ndepressed area\nand it is vitally important\nthe county is doing some things but it's\nimportant that the state is able to hear\ndirectly particularly from The\nDescendants\nof\nsaplo org Hamlin\nI support this bill\nthere's no such thing as a perfect Bill\nI've seen very few come out of this\nhouse every once in a while we do get a\nperfect one but there there are some\nthings that that\nwould have liked to have seen\nbut this is probably as good a bill as\nwe're able to get out of here and give\nthe kind of representation and audience\nto the members of hog Hammett that is so\nnecessary when I first came to the\nlegislation I represented since Simon's\nIsland and I told some folk this morning\nat that time there were 23 votes\non that island\nI got 22 of them I'm still looking for\nthat one traitor but\nthis is an extremely important bill\nand I asked for your support of it thank\nyou\ngentleman has yielded the well\nis there any objection to the previous\nquestion being ordered the chair

last\nbill we're going to take up House Bill\n244\nMr Clark where you're either caption the\nhouse bill 244.\nhousehold 244 by representative Petrie\nis 166 to be entitled an act to amend\nchapter one and title 27 the official go\nto George annotated relating to General\nProvisions relative to Game and Fish\nso it's extend the date by which rules\nand regulations prescribed by the board\nof Natural Resources must be in effect\nfor the purposes of establishing\ncriminal violations\nthis bill ever referred to the committee\non game fish and parks that committee\nrecommends that this bill do pass\nby committee substitute\nthe gentleman from the coast chairman\nPetrie is recognized to present the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker ladies and\ngentlemen house bring your house bill\n244. great to follow my good friend\nrepresentative Loach from the coast with\nanother Coastal bill for those of you\nthat weren't here in 2019 we were able\nto pass the oyster mariculture bill that\nyear most of the provisions in here\nrelate to that but I want to go through\nthe bill try to very briefly explain to\nyou what's in here the first thing I\nwant to point out was an amendment made\nin committee which is section 2 which\nbasically now will allow electronic\ncalls for hunting bobcat and fox in this\nstate that would be during season we\nalready have a season as most of you or\nsome of them maybe in more urban sites\nmay not be aware there are game species\nand um we are going to expand and allow\nelectronic calling for hunting that game\nanimal when you leave that section you\ngo to the real uh\nI kind of meat of the bill as it began\nwhich relates to Coastal issues and\nyou'll see on lines 40 uh 45 to 48 there\nwhat we're doing here Seafood dealers\nhave to report\nto the Department of Natural Resources\nCoastal Resources Division all of the\nHarvest and the sales of uh uh\nshellfish and shrimp things of that\nnature all Seafood has to be reported\nmonthly to the department so they can\ntrack\nthese these sales and populations we\nhave some\ndealers who have decided that if they\ndon't have any activity they simply\ndon't have to report and of course the\nconundrum for the Department is they\ndon't know whether they're not reporting\nin violating the requirement or if they\nactually have no activity at all so what\nwe do right here is make it very clear\nthat if you have no activity you still\nhave to monthly report that non-activity\nso that is what we do in the first part\nof the bill in section four we we re we\nredefine cage so when I pass the\nmariculture bill and here in 2019 what\nwe the the the industry generally uh\nremember we grow oysters when we Farm\nthem in the intertidal zone in cages and\nat the time we used individual cages the\nnew technology to use that term is that\nwe have a multitude of smaller cages\ninside one aggregate larger larger cage\nand so you see a change of definition\nthere in section five you see we're\nbasically dealing with our Master\nHarvesters and then our Harvesters that\nwork under master Harvest Harvesters to\ngrow and harvest shellfish and what\nwe're doing here on line 81 you'll see\nthere here and then on the other section\nas well we're changing shall Language by\nthe department to May language the\nreason we're doing that is to give the\ndepartment the ability\nto determine whether or not they need to\ndeny a permit or in the next section to\nrevoke a permit based on an infraction\nthere are smaller infractions the\ndepartment would not want to uh be\ncompelled to remove someone's permit for\nso we're given discretion to the\ndepartment very important I poured out\npoint out however because we're talking\nabout oysters on line 85 to 87 you'll\nsee the Shou language remains on\ncertification from the Department of\nAgriculture so anything that relates to\nfood safety those violations loss of\ncertification they would still lose\ntheir permit and then finally section 7\nMr Speaker eliminates the cage fee\naltogether and the original Bill we put\na one dollar fee on each cage and we're\neliminating that all together because of\nthe new system Mr Speaker that's as fast\nas I can go through that bill and I'm\nglad to answer any questions if I wasn't\nclear in any way\nI think you were clear but you do have a\nquestion Representatives representing\nsayings chairman Sainz from the coast\nmy good friend does the gentleman yield\nI do indeed as this bill is vitally\nimportant to the Vitality of Georgia's\nSeafood industry would the gentleman\nclarify that the best seafood in this\nstate can be found in the Golden Isles\nwow\nwell at risk of uh let me do this at the\nrisk of losing your vote the best\nseafood in this country can be found on\nthe Georgia coast we can agree on that\nrepresentative that's for certain\nuntil we came up got to defining areas I\ndidn't have this question I've been\nlooking for it though\nthe gentleman knows probably more about\noysters than anybody in this house\nrepresentative Al Williams has a\nquestion I will agree with that David\nspeaking with the gentleman yield yes\nsir is it not true that this bill helps\nresurrect the oyster harvesting business\nin Georgia that for years has been\nalmost dominant yes sir I I believe that\nto be true sir is it not further true\nthat there's never been a question that\nbest tasting oysters in America\nare found on the coast of Georgia\nrepresentative you are correct and is it\nnot true that with this we will be able\nto have an oyster that is even more\nrestaurant quality because we're not\nknown for our Beauty just our taste and\nis it not true that\nthe Macintosh to the deserve at the\nOcean Air is picked in McIntosh County\nby Ernest McIntosh\nI believe that is true representative\nand I I agree wholeheartedly with all of\nyour comments\nMr Speaker I have to take one more okay\none more and that's from another\ngentleman from the coast\nyet but um chairman DeLoach finish this\none off\nthis gentleman yield I do I do sir let's\nget a little more specific if you don't\nmind about oysters isn't it true\nthe finest

only\nthing keeping us I want this body to\nknow this the only thing keeping us from\nfarming oysters today everything we\npassed has been implemented is the Corps\nof Engineers the federal

body\npassed and the governor signed the\nsurprise Belling patient protection act\nwithin that piece of legislation\narbitration was developed between the\npatient and the excuse me between the\nprovider and the insurer which took the\npatient out of the dispute which then\neliminated those costly medical bills\nthat would arrive six and eight months\nlater\nthe bill you have before you today HB\n295 was drafted at the request of the\nDepartment of Insurance to address some\nof the issues occurring in the\nadministration of the arbitration Act\nthis legislation primarily does six\nthings one it extends a response dates\nfor the arbitration Center sections from\n30 to 60 days\nit also addresses the failure of the\ninsurer to designate whether the health\ncare plans are subject to the erisa\njurisdiction this is important because\nif it's narissa plan then the\narbitration goes to the federal side if\nthe non arrest of the arbitration stays\nin the state and is judicated by DOI\nit also clarifies that ensure payments\nare made directly to the provider or\nfacility within 15 working days when a\nsubmitted electronically and 30 calendar\ndays for paper claims this is presently\nin Georgia Code already\nit also addresses the issues of\nnotification for complete payment this\nis important because it that is the\ntrigger that starts the arbitration\nwhen the provider challenges the payment\nor the denial or procedure by the\ninsurer\nit also creates penalties for failure to\nrespond to the DOI requests this is for\ninsurers and providers\nand finally it provides\nfor doi to develop future policies to\nensure and improve the arbitration\nprocess\nthis legislation is a result of several\nmeetings over the summer and fall\nwhich represented there were insurers\nproviders hospitals and the Department\nof Insurance\nand through thoughtful deliberation all\nparties agreed to this carefully warded\npiece of legislation\nso legislation is very important

congratulations\nMr clerk if you read the caption to\nHouse Bill\n348 348\nHouse Bill 348 by representative Collins\nthe 71st being titled back to amend\nchapter 14 and title 40 the official\nquoted George annotated relating the use\nof speed detection devices and red light\ncameras so to provide for standards for\nsign warnings of the use of automated\ntraffic enforcement safety devices as\nBill Levin referred the committee on\nmotor vehicles that committee recommends\nthat this bill do pass by committee\nsubstitute\nchairman Collins is recognized to\npresent the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker House Bill 348 has\nbeen a work in progress for quite some\ntime ladies and gentlemen this deals\nwith the automatic\ntraffic enforcement devices what I would\nrefer to as the school camera\nuh bill or devices that capture someone\nwho exceeds the speed limit in a school\nzone\nit's a good program that I really feel\nlike we need to keep in place because we\nneed to make sure and protect our school\nzones from Speeders during the\nappropriate times one of the things that\nwe're addressing in this piece of\nlegislation\ncurrently right now we have a lot of\ndistricts that are running these devices\nall through the day and we want to bring\nsome guardrails in place this\nlegislation if you pass it today ladies\nand gentlemen it'll only allow these\nschool zones to be enforced with this\ntraffic device for 30 minutes before the\nbell rings in the morning 30 minutes\nafter the bell rings in the morning so\nthere's an hour in the morning\nthere's an hour in the afternoon 30\nminutes before dismissal 30 minutes\nafter school has been dismissed so\nthere's two hours a day also we're\nproviding some more transparency in this\npiece of legislation before these\ncameras can operate and be enforced you\nhave to have the lights flashing have to\nhave the yellow lights flashing there\nhas to be a warning sign notifying those\nfolks that they're coming into that area\nso it's not something that's going to be\nused and abused throughout the day it's\ngoing to be specifically timed to be\nused in operation now for some of you\nback home who have a school like my in\nmy district\nI have a campus that is bisected by a\ncity street and I have a carve out in\nhere if you have a campus that's\nbisected by by a city or county Street\nand you have students and faculty\nthat'll be going to be going across uh\nthat street during the hours of school\nyou can run these cameras during that\ntime but again they have to be yellow\nlights flashing there has to be signage\nthat warns you of that the other piece\nof this piece of the legislation I think\nis very important is we have had an\noutcry I know many of you have from a\nlot of folks who have purchased cars\nwhere the previous owner did not pay the\nCivil monetary penalty and there was a\nlien on the title so the folks that\nbought the car or you traded a car to a\ndealer and didn't clean up these these\nfees the person who bought the car had\nto do that I spoke with a gentleman this\nmorning down in south Georgia who told\nme he spent thirty thousand dollars of\nhis money from an auction house clearing\nup titles on cars that came through his\nauction house so this cler this cleans\nup a tremendous piece of tremendous\nloophole that we're going to be able to\ngo back home and say that we fixed the\nother thing that this does it also caps\nthose fees associated with those civil\nmonetary penalties at twenty five\ndollars my good friend Jason Ridley had\na piece of legislation earlier in the\nweek uh that that tightens down on that\nbut this also does the same thing it\ncaps those administrative fees\nprocessing fees at 25 dollars\nso Mr Speaker with that I will be glad\nto answer any questions it's a good\npiece of legislation that's been thought\nthrough uh vetted through committee a\ncouple of times and I think it's a good\npublic policy that we can all go home\nand be proud that we fix something that\nneeds to be fixed\ngentleman yield for a question yes sir\nto your left chairman Parsons has a\nquestion yes sir\nthank you speaker gentleman yield yes\nsir isn't truth I've just gone through\nthe bill here I had I had not read it\nbefore now and I'm in complete agreement\nwith you as far as the school zones and\nthen the time period that they it could\nbe in effect I think what 30 minutes\nbefore and Thursday yes sir and I've\nlooked through and uh based on what I\njust read and what you have presented\nthere are no other changes to regarding\nthe school bus stop arm camera other\nthan what you have presented just now is\nthat true right I meant to mention that\ntoo thank you for bringing that up in\nsection 10 of the bill uh we're just\ncodifying there also if you if you don't\ndo not pay that civil monetary penalty\nfor overtaking a school bus your\nregistration cannot be renewed uh and\nand there's no lien on the title so\nwe're making those both uh the same all\nright thank you sir yes sir thank you\nrepresentative Buckner to your left has\na question Charlie the ladies recognized\nthank you Mr Speaker does the gentleman\nyield yes ma'am to my friend I do I\nheard you say that when someone went to\npurchase a car that if someone owed back\num for tickets and things that the the\nthe the dealer had to pay that big\nbusiness at the auction house so how's\nthat going to be resolved in the future\nwith this bill I'm having trouble\nfinding that well uh what's going to\nhappen is is if you have a civil\nmonetary penalty that's issued and you\nhave a a hold on your registration\nmeaning you cannot renew your\nregistration if you have not cleaned\nthat up so you know the thought behind\nthat was if someone trades that vehicle\nthat that person that uh that obtained\nthat car whether it's a auction house or\nan individual they're not responsible\nfor that\ndoes the gentleman further you yes ma'am\nso does that mean that the locals don't\nget those fines or and it gets cleaned\nup that way or they find the person well\nunfortunately uh it's been my experience\nlooking at this uh you know most people\ndon't trade cars on a regular basis so\nthat that's going to be the the way that\nwe enforce this uh I guess I I want to\nsay that if someone doesn't pay this\nthen it basically just drops off of that\nregistration\nokay\nit's not a perfect fix but it's a fix\ngentlemen you go for one more question\none more question then I know the day is\ngetting late and this is representative\nAl Williams is recognized for a question\ngentlemen yield to my friend yes sir is\nit not true that I'm holding a picture\nthat my wife sent me\nshe can get a little heavy footage but\nshe got this speeding cost me a hundred\ndollars\nand it's 11 34 in the morning and a\nschool zone so if this passes can I get\n75 of that money back\nthere's nothing there's nothing in the\nbuilding here that's retroactive but uh\nwe we can always come back next year and\nlook at something\nMr Speaker that's all I have about this\nbill I would ask for this body's\nfavorable consideration and thank the\nmembers who have given me positive input\nin making this bill what it is I yield\nwill\nthe gentleman has yielded the well is\nthere any objection to the previous\nquestion being ordered the chair hears\nnone the

404 by representative\nCarpenter IV and others to be entitled\nan act to amend chapter 7 title 44 the\nofficial go to Georgia annotated\nrelating to landlord and tenances to\nprovide for a duty\nof habitility for certain rental\nagreements to provide for an exception\nto such Duty and to provide for an\nexception to the landlord toward a\nliability\nthis bill I haven't referred to the\ncommittee on Judiciary that committee\nrecommends that this bill do pass by\ncommittee substitute\nchairman Casey Carpenter is recognized\nto present the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker ladies and\ngentlemen of the house I come before you\nto present house bill 404.\nthe safe at home Act is a measured step\nto ensure that tenants across Georgia\nhave certain rights written into Georgia\ncode for the first time\nbefore I go into this bill I want to\nexplain a little bit about my childhood\ngrowing up in Whitfield County\nmy family moved 16 times in 18 years\nwe on sometimes we rented it but we\nrented a lot when I was 17 we spent a\nthree-month period around Christmas\nwithout heat\nso I understand the issues that tenants\nface but I also understand the\nissues that landlords face\nthis bill seeks to balance the interest\nof both while admitting that livability\nis a foundational piece of a tenant\nlandlord relationship\nHouse Bill 404 creates a warranty of\nhabitability For the First Time In\nGeorgia code\nit makes it clear that when elise's\nsigned the housing must be fit for human\nhabitation and it must be maintained\nthroughout that lease\nHouse Bill 404 also provides the right\nto cure to tenants across Georgia\nthis provision will provide tenants with\na three business day chance to pay their\nrent\nwhile I feel that most landlords provide\na grace period now this would ensure\nthat individuals are given some time to\nto rectify and and find necessary funds\nto pay their rent\nit would also require that such notice\nbe tacked to the door and delivered by\nany agreed-upon manner in the rental\nagreement\nHouse Bill 404 also caps security\ndeposits in the state of Georgia\nfor the first time across the state of\nGeorgia we have a cap of two months in\nthis legislation\nwe all want to see that the families\nhave the financial ability\nto move into safe and stable housing My\nHope Is that the horrific stories of\nschool children living at Extended Stays\nfor extended for years on end will be\nremedied by this cap\nfinally House Bill 404 seeks to ensure\nthat when a tenant is going through the\neviction process the air conditioning\ncannot be turned off\nthis bill is an important piece of\nlegislation to begin a conversation\nabout about what rights We Believe\nGeorgia's tenants have\nobviously we all understand that stable\nand safe housing is Paramount for the\nchildren of our great state\nI think it's also important to\nunderstand that not all landlords are\nbad\nmany in fact go above and beyond the\nmeasures that we're addressed in this\nbill\nbut my hope and hopefully your hope is\nto address the Bad actors that give\nlandlords a bad name and the Bad actors\nthat Prey Upon the least in our state\nI look forward to your support on this\nbill and I will be glad to take any\nquestions\ngentlemen yields for a question\nrepresentative hugely to your left has a\nquestion representative hugley is\nrecognized thank you Mr Speaker does the\ngentleman yield yes ma'am thank you for\nthis important legislation in your uh\nevaluation of this problem did you all\naddress when there's a dispossessory\num\neliminating the possibility that\nlandlords just put people's stuff out\nall over the\nall over the the front yard uh causing\nharm and distress to other people who\nlive in those neighborhoods uh I mean I\nthink that's already addressed in code\nbut this bill did not address that no\nma'am\ngentlemen further yield yes sir\nrepresentative yokoye is recognized for\na question\nthank you Mr Speaker that's gentleman\nagain absolutely all right\num is the cap on the deposit two months\nor three months two months it was the\noriginal legislation was three through\nthe process the Judiciary through\nmultiple hours in the Judiciary\nCommittee we we changed it\nthank you thank you\nrepresentative Maynor has a question to\nfuel yield representative Maynard to\nyour right real quick speaker you notice\nthat I know where everybody sits when\nyou sit in the back you see where\neverybody's at so I'm already I don't\nhave to look for you I know where you're\nat well I was wondering if you're paying\nattention to what we do in this house\nbarely just barely\nevery now and then when it's convenient\nthank you Mr Speaker does the gentleman\nyield absolutely I have a few questions\nfor my friend and I want to just make\nsure I'm reading this correctly so if\nsomeone does not pay their rent within\nthree days\nthey can go to court and the process\nthey will be evicted instead of\nimmediately is that what it says that's\ncorrect it basically it's three business\ndays right so you have three business\ndays once you've been notified hey you\ndidn't pay your rent which you should\nprobably already know but anyway once\nyou've been notified that you that your\nyour rent was due and it wasn't paid it\nprovides you with a three business day\ngrace period before that process can\nbegin and what was the number before\nzero\nzero days correct yes ma'am so this is\nthe first time in Georgia code that\nyou've established this grace period so\nright now landlord does the gentleman\nfurther yeah absolutely yep\num so before landlords were giving Grace\nperiods\num like being nice yeah so some some\nlandlords gave Grace periods and that\nwould still remain right this doesn't\neliminate the landlord's ability to\nprovide great spirits this just says\nthat in the state of Georgia we're going\nto require you to at least provide a\nthree business day grace period if you\nwill thank you and does the gentleman\nyield for one more question yes ma'am\nso right now I love that you have in\nhere that the landlords must keep the\npremises up to date\num or in good repair\nwhat does the bill do for the landlords\nthat do not do that that would be a\nbreach of the contract that would\nprovide the tenant with the ability to\nexit the lease\nthank you thank you\nchairman Prince has recognized for a\nquestion go right to left\nyes sir\nis it not true that this\ngrace period that you spoke of will not\naffect late fees\nfor the for the uh the renter of this\nproperty that's correct it doesn't\naddress the fees obviously when you\nrinse late you rinse late but it does\njust say look give these folks three\nthree business days to help before the\nprocess begins of eviction because once\nthat process begins it's hard to get\nthat it's hard to remedy\nand it's and it's really a Scarlet\nLetter moving forward uh as you as if as\nyou try to rent other housing\nrepresentative fry right in front of you\ntwo years do Republicans have any\nquestions I'm just kidding hey Mr Frye\ngood to see you Spencer Hey this is kind\nof one-sided here\nI'm kind of feeling like I'm under\nattack there go ahead my friend\ndoes thank you Mr speakers gentleman you\nknow absolutely\num just to clarify you said that is\nthere a clause in there that talks about\nnot turning the heat off yeah all that's\nalready in code so the cooling piece was\na was a clarification many felt that\nthat was already the case but we we felt\nit was important to solidify that okay\nis the gentleman further you yes sir I\njust want to thank y'all and thank the\nspeaker for bringing this legislation\nthere's a lot more work isn't it true\nthere's a lot more work that we need to\nbe doing to protect our tenants from uh\nout of state predatory landlords and uh\nthank you very much like most items\nthere's always more we can do\nwhere your wish will be fulfilled here\nchairman sayings to your left has a\nquestion sir headed down to the coast\nthank you Mr Speaker I'm glad I qualify\nfor uh his request does the gentleman\nyield absolutely is it not true that um\nI'd be hard-pressed to find a member of\nthis house who shows more care and\ncompassion throughout his day than the\ngentleman at the well and that this bill\naccurately reflects that to the George\nto the housing needs of Georgians all\nacross the state I appreciate that\nagree with a compliment thank you sir\nrepresentative Roberts is recognized for\na question\nthank you Mr Speaker

clear but\ncould you speak a little bit too yeah\nyeah so we wanted to leave it uh open to\nthe judges at this point we were afraid\nif we started getting into specifics\nthen it would we're running

Todd Jones to present the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker\ncolleagues I want to talk to you today\nabout aspirational thinking and about\nwhere and why\nnot only did we think about running for\noffice but why we did and why we sit\nhere today\nwhy it is we convene why does it we talk\npolicy and why it is that we have\ndiscourse and also agreement\nwe think about the 10.7 million citizens\nthat are within the state of Georgia and\nwe think about what is the best path for\nus to be able to assist them\nwe know a fundamental fact about this\nstate and that's 80 percent of every\nGeorgia family is impacted by either\nmental health or substance abuse\nevery day\neach of us is getting phone calls every\nday each of us is getting emails and\nevery day each of us are getting\nrequests from constituents asking us\nwhat can I do\nI don't know where to put my son\nI don't know how to help my daughter and\nI don't know how to make sure my cousin\nis accounted for\nthere's no place for me to put them\nmy son's been in rehab three times my\ndaughter's been there too\nthese are the things that we hear as\nrepresentatives and I know that our\nfriends across the third floor hear the\nsame thing\nevery day when we come here for the 40\ndays and I hope the nine months that we\nsit aside and think to ourselves what's\nthe best thing that we can do for the\nstate of Georgia\nwe know that 80 percent of the families\nin this state are struggling\nthey need a place to turn\nthey need to know that we're there for\nthem\nso we put ourselves into the public\nArena\npresident Teddy Roosevelt told us about\nthat\nhe said it's better to get into the\narena it is better to toil that it's\nbetter to fight it is better to have the\nconversations that are needed in order\nto be successful\nit's better to sweat\nbleed\ntoil\nand get to where it is that we need to\nget to and whether or not you won or\nlost the fact is we got on the field\nto not get on the field is to absolutely\nworst thing we can do so the question\nbecomes is do we let the perfect be the\nenemy of the good\n1013 got us halfway there\nit's like building the pyramids we got a\nfoundation 520 gets us a little further\nwe got to Everest to first base camp\nLet's Get Closer to the second base camp\nand that's what 520 does\n520 gives us the opportunity to look at\nthings that we didn't have the\nopportunity to before 10 13.\nit sounds simple we need a bed study\nwho thinks we need a bed study why would\nyou think in 159 counties with 10.7\nmillion people we need to study beds but\nwe do\nwe don't know the type of beds we have\nwe don't know the workforce that aligns\nto that bed\nwe don't know the rates we don't know\nthe conditions we don't know things and\nwe need to know that and section 6 does\nthat for us\nwe have to take care of all Georgians\nthat come into our Stead\nthere is data that exists across all of\nour agencies the entire alphabet soup\nbut the question becomes is data sitting\nidle is data that does not help us\nwe need to look at that data we need to\nunderstand the analytics that can give\nus the Predictive Analytics but most\nimportantly the care\na child within defects is not a child\nthat basically has the ability to go out\nto the doctor and find out can I get all\nyour records\ndefects is the last point\nMom and Dad aren't there grandma and\ngrandpa and uncle and all the cousins\naren't there for that child so the\nquestion becomes is where is defects\nturn\nhow do they get the records that they\nneed\nwe can't have the agencies basically\ngetting into a squabble in terms of\nwhose date it is who should get it who\nshould see it absolutely not and this\nbill will absolutely ensure that that\ndata is catered to so little Johnny or\nLittle Sally is going to be able to be\ntaken care of by defects within our\nstate\nit is super critical that we understand\na very small population within this\nstate\nyou will hear the phrase familiar\nphrases pardon me familiar faces a\nhundred times\nthese familiar faces are absolutely\ncritical to us getting mental health and\nsubstance abuse under control in this\nstate\nI can't give you exact numbers but they\nprobably make up point one percent of\nthat population but they probably take\n50 percent of the resources of this\nstate so the question becomes is do we\nlet it just keep going do we kick it\ndown the street or do we say no\nwe're going to do a study that's it\na study\nwe're going to try and understand how\nall these agencies how health care the\nDepartment of Corrections law\nenforcement can work together\ncan come together and know that we're\ngoing to have the ability to understand\nthis population better than we ever have\nknown this population and what can we do\nto help them\nso yes in this bill\nwe ask the agencies we asked the doc we\nasked law enforcement we asked health\ncare we ask a series of different\ndepartments to come together and say\nWhat's the definition and what could be\nsome of the pathways to help the\nfamiliar faces\nbecause ultimately when President\nRoosevelt's asked when President\nRoosevelt asked us\ndo you want to get into the arena will\nyou get into the arena the question\nbecomes is\nI know so many of you so well I know me\nand I think you're like me\nI'd rather be on the field than lose\nthan win by forfeit\nso to me\nI hope that you can have a favorable\nconsideration of this bill but most\nimportantly I hope you know that getting\nonto the field today means we got into\nthe arena\nwe got into the arena to fight and we\ngot into the arena to be able to make\nsure that we perfect this\nnot just for the people in this chamber\nand the families that touch us every day\nnot just for our constituents and the\nSenate's constituents and the governors\nbut rather to make sure that today and\ntomorrow Georgia is taken care of\nto make sure that the foundation that\nwe're going to create with 520 getting\nus up just a little bit further up the\npyramid is going to be there for each\nand every one that comes through Georgia\ntoday and tomorrow\ncolleagues I ask you for your favorable\nconsideration of this bill\nand I'll yield the well to Mary Margaret\nOliver\nthe gentleman has yielded the well\nrepresenting Mary Margaret Oliver is\nrecognized\nthank you Mr Speaker\nwell chairman Jones brings a lot of\npassion to this issue and I'm grateful\nfor that passion I'm also grateful for\nall of the other contributors that have\ncome forward really in the last two\nyears to make Georgia move forward to\nallow Georgia to move forward to serve\nthe families who face the crisis of\nmental illness every day\nit I think it'll be helpful I hope it'll\nbe helpful to those who are new here but\nalso to those who participated with us\nlast year in 1013 to do a very short\nreview\nof the progress we made as you know\nabout two years ago the Behavioral\nHealth commission\nchaired by Kevin Tanner became an\nintensive through subcommittee action to\ndevelop a legislative proposal for your\nconsideration in 2022 and ultimately\n1013 passed in 2022 unanimously\nbipartisan obviously by both Chambers\nspeaker ralston's leadership was\ncritical\nlet me say that again\nspeaker ralston's leadership was\ncritical\nand speaker Burns has stepped forward in\na very strong way in a way that's been\nenormously encouraging again in a\nbipartisan way to bring additional\nreforms and additional helps to the\nfamilies of Georgia\nin 1013 you called for the appropriation\nof grants for assisted outpatient\ntreatment for that population that\ncircles between the ER the jail and the\nstreet those guys across the street from\nour chamber right now are part of that\nintensive population five assisted\nOutpatient Treatment programs have been\nfunded across the state all of which\nhave been in rural areas\nyour support in 1013 for co-responder\nprograms which allows mental health\nprofessionals to go out with law\nenforcement has grown from about 15\nteams to 49 teams funded again through\n1013.\nyou know Justice Boggs chief justice\nMichael Boggs of the Georgia Supreme\nCourt has become a national leader on\nthe issue of this jail Criminal Justice\nReform jail homeless ER population and\nnumber of the matters that we are\ntalking about in 520 today our\ncontributions he has made based on\ngrants he has brought to Georgia based\non this leadership\nif you look at a number of different\nproposals to do a study to do an\nanalysis and to report by December 1st\nall of that relates to accountability\nit relates to accountability from our\nstate agencies and in every case where\nwe've asked for these reports in this\nwork we have gotten cooperation from\nState agencies I want to applaud those\nagencies for working with Advocates and\nworking with the commission to come\nforward and say we need this work effort\nwe will be accountable and because it is\nin this statute we will be able to\nreceive grants again national grants and\nfunding and give to you a good product\nto take the next step\nfor instance in 1013 we funded a study\nof Transportation we've heard so much\nfrom the sheriffs about the difficulty\nof transporting mentally ill folks in\nand around these emergency crisis\nsituations based on that report that\ncame forward commissioner Tanner is\nimplementing a pilot program in\nSouthwest Georgia because that is an\narea where they need the most based on\n1013 we reported on for the first time\nalthough we had statutorily called for\nit several times a prescription\nformulary that now gives us the\nopportunity to understand in our\nprocurement contracts how families can\nbe treated we represent to you a report\nof progress based on 1013 and 520 is the\nnext step\nthrough the study subcommittee process\nof the Behavioral Health commission all\nof the meetings from this summer and all\nthe reports are available to you online\nwe come to the realization that I think\neveryone in this body knows that\nWorkforce is our biggest challenge\nin 520\nSection 3 beginning on page eight we\ntalk about the Staffing level analysis\nthat must be conducted in relation to\nthe salaries we are paying our Mental\nHealth Service delivery folks it's about\n20 percent vacancy rate right now across\nthe state along with that\nStaffing level we also have an\nAppropriations process going forward\nthat tells us about the Medicaid\nreimbursement rates that we are\nanalyzing that will be a part of the\nsteps forward on section 12\nwe're asking the governor's health\nstrategy commission headed by Grant\nThomas\nto take the 25 to 35 different specific\nrecommendations our Workforce study\ncommittee made for licensing board\nreforms and make an analysis by December\nas to what statutory changes we must\nmake to make our licensing board more\nfriendly\nmore modern and more workable for the\nmental health professionals across the\nstate that's section 12 on page 20.\nsection 14 on page 22 offers to nurses\nand other mental health professionals\nthe same opportunity that's provided for\ndoctors across the state and 13 other\nhealth care providers to perform with\nthem an alternative disciplinary process\nif a professional license holder has\nfound himself or herself in trouble\nperhaps by substance abuse or perhaps by\ndepression they can voluntarily enter\ninto an alternative disciplinary program\nto protect their license keep them\nworking and serving Georgians but also\npay for they will pay for it the\nmonetary monitoring of their treatment\nprocess this has been enormously\nsuccessful in the doctor community and I\nbelieve it will extend the professional\nlives of many other professionals like\nnurses and clinical social workers\nwe also in section 19 on page 38 are\nexpanding the loan forgiveness program\nfor mental health professionals who are\nserving Georgia Citizens today last year\nin 1013 we created an educational loan\nforgiveness program for students and\nthis year we're extending it to\nprofessionals\n1013 has been a success for folks in\nyour District\nI believe and I hope that you will join\nwith us in me making the promises of\n1013 accountable\nbut 520 is essential for us to move\nforward for additional services and\nadditional accountability the taxpayers\nof Georgia expect us to apply when we're\ndelivering delivering service to\nfamilies in crisis\nI am very grateful for all of your\ncontributions we've made many changes to\nthis bill and will continue to listen to\nyou and understand what your priorities\nare and I thank you for the opportunity\nto do this work\nMr Speaker I am happy to answer\nquestions and Mr chairman Jones I'm sure\nwe'll be willing to do so also\nbut we'll allow you two to work together\nto answer any questions we do have one\nquestion a couple of questions at this\npoint chair recognizes representative\nKenner\nKennard for a question to your left\nthank you Mr Speaker does the gentle\nlady and gentleman yield\nisn't it true that most who abuse\nsubstances of drugs and alcohol are\ndoing so\nbecause there's an underlying mental\nhealth condition that's untreated\nand therefore substance use is not\nreally a criminal issue it's a health\nissue and isn't it further true that a\nlot of people thousands in our\ncorrectional system are not inherently\nwrongdoers they are simply ill\nI I want to recognize another area where\nGeorge is yes is to answer your question\nanother area where Georgia is a leader\nin peer specialist and this bill\naddresses specifically a greater\nparticipation in peer specialists in our\nleading our changes the co-diagnosis of\nmental illness and substance abuse is a\nreal issue for the gentleman outside on\nthe street and in our jails and in our\ners\nBased on data we know Circa 80 to 85\npercent is due to that in terms of dual\ndiagnosis mental health being the\nunderlying issue in terms of\nself-medicating in terms of what we see\nfrom them so I would concur in terms of\nthat and then I think also the data\nshows us in all 50 states unfortunately\nthe doc or I'll say the criminal justice\nsystem has become the biggest provider\nof either substance abuse or mental uh\nhealth services so thank you will you\nyield for one more question please\nisn't it true that I am and we are\neternally grateful for your work on this\nissue and it's an honor to serve with\nyou in this chamber thank you\nrepresentative Byrd is recognized for a\nquestion straight in front of you\nthank you very much do you yield\nis it not true you just stated 80 of\nGeorgian families have mental illness\nuh no ma'am\num representative bird what I said was\napproximately 80 percent of the families\nin Georgia face a mental health or a\nsubstance abuse problem\nso that would mean 80 percent of\nGeorgians no well 80 percent of the\nGeorgia families have either a mental\nhealth or a substance abuse issue yes so\nshould all of them behold into G facts\nuh representative Byrd I was using\ndefects as as an example uh what I was\ntrying to get at was we have a myriad of\ndata and a volume of data within the\nI'll just say number of alphabet soup\nagencies and what we're trying to do is\nmake it where we have that data sharing\nthat allows us to be better customer\nservice and better service to our\nconstituents that was an example to be\nable to provide you where the rubber\nwould meet the road in terms of that\napplication and I use defects as an\nexample but I'm happy to give you a DC a\nDCH a dbhdd example there's several\nother examples that I could provide\noffline\nand do you further yield\nyes\nregarding um loan forgiveness\nthis body normally would say excuse me\nBernie Sanders would call this\nsocialists when we wanted to give away\nstudent loans but yet we are doing this\nin the state of Georgia thank you\nis that a question ma'am\nyou have another question let's see\nrepresenting Maynor\nis recognized for a question\nMr Speaker does the great two\nlegislators yield for a question\nokay these are easy questions I\nappreciate the bill and this is really\nso I can go back to the people that also\nsupport mental health I can answer those\nquestions for them so under each\ndifferent section when it's listing\ndifferent professions so for example\n572-579 it basically says that we're\ngonna practice HIPAA and then in\n582-585 it says we won't hold these\nindividuals liable but it since it does\nsay on 584 if performed in accordance is\nthat basically saying that um\nthis statute says we must practice these\nHIPAA guidelines and if someone does not\npractice the HIPAA guidelines they then\nin turn would have given up their\nimmunity to liability\nabout the alternative disciplinary\nprocess in section 14 and 15 am I\ncorrect yes those sections mirror\nexactly the alternative disciplinary\nprocess that set forth in for doctors\nand 13 other professionals and the\nimmunity deals there with exactly what\ntracks the federal HIPAA language I\nthink that every every time we've talked\nabout data sharing in this bill and and\nother bills we always cite specifically\nthe Paramount Authority requirements of\nHIPAA and the code of federal\nregulations so I don't think there's an\ninconsistency in the way we've set it\nout\nokay so just for clarity I'm I'm\nagreeing with you but I just want to\nmake sure I'm reading it right so line\n584 if you further yield\nit says if performed in accordance so\nthey if they don't perform it in\naccordance then they will be liable for\ngiving out people's information when\nthey should not have been\nI think that we are required to follow\nfederal law in relation to privacy as\ndefined by HIPAA there's a lot of case\nlaw on that and there's an emerging code\nof federal relations and we are required\nto follow it and if we don't we're in\nviolation of the federal law\nthank you\num line 680 if you further yield if\nthat's okay Mr Speaker\none more and so since we are doing these\npilot programs I'm assuming that's why\npilot study programs that's why we're\ninstituting the institutional review\nboard is that are we instituting them\nbecause their research subjects and we\nneed to do that to apply for the federal\nfunding\nI think you're still in the alternative\ndisciplinary section am I correct and\nthat's the specific section for nurses\nand I think there are there is some\nfederal research that goes on about how\nyou help people keep their license and\nkeep working for Georgia Citizens it's\nsection 16. 16 yes about the alternative\ndisciplinary process for nurses\nthank you\nchair lady Cooper is recognized for a\nquestion all the way in the bacteria on\nthe right thank you Mr Speaker will the\npresenters yield for a question yes okay\nthank you is it not true that unlike the\nproposed plan for loan forgivement in\nWashington that is a blanket plan and\ndoesn't look into what the student was\nmajoring in or where they live\nour plan is very specific to areas that\nhave no one to treat\nour mentally ill and that it is very\nspecific to people that are majoring in\nfields such as psychology or social\nworkers that would be of great value to\nhelping us meet that major lacking need\nof professionals\nthat we need to treat the mentally ill\nand much of our rural areas all over the\nstate of Georgia\nchairman Cooper I think you're spot on I\nthink one of the things that we need to\nremember is this uh for those of us who\nI'll say are fortunate enough to live\npossibly in Forsyth County or Cherokee\nCounty or other places like that where\nI'll say professionals are abundant this\nis something that is not nearly acute as\nit is in Lanier County and Eccles County\nand Ware County so the fact of the\nmatter is this program is nowhere near\nas broad as something that we would see\ncoming out of DC but rather a strategic\nhit in terms of making sure the roles\nthat we need in order to apply to the\nplaces that we needed to most to hit the\nunderserved so that we are putting those\nproper investments in this body has\nabsolutely done that with Mercer it's\ndone with Augusta in terms of the MDS we\nhave seen the way that we have been able\nto hopefully shift our resource and\nshift our priority so that we are able\nto put more I'll say resources more\ncapabilities into the areas that need it\nmost your Birthright within this state\nwhere you live and where you were born\nshould not define whether or not you get\nproper health care and Health Care is\nphysical and mental and substance abuse\nso we need to be able to attack those\nand attack those strategically\nrepresentative Roman is recognized for a\nquestion on the center Island left\n[Music]\nthank you Mr Speaker\num does the general lady and gentleman\nyield for a question thank you\num is it not true that our EMS Personnel\nare called to help someone with mental\nhealth concerns much too often putting a\nmassive strain on an already over\nstrained system and that this bill could\nhelp with that\nthe law enforcement folks I talked to I\nasked them what percentage of your of\nyour 911 calls coming from a family\ncrisis or mental health issue and they\ntell me between 20 and 40 percent\nand they have found enormous Savings in\nsending mental health professionals out\nit's also safer\nit's safer for law enforcement it's\nsafer for the patient it's safer for the\nEMS to have someone with that expertise\non a family and psychiatric crisis\nif I could just add to that one of the\nthings that representative Oliver and I\nhave learned over the course of this\ntime is that we've also seen the\ndecriminalization of effectively mental\nhealth and substance abuse so by having\nthose type of professionals go out they\nare being effectively taken to a medical\nfacility as opposed to a jail first and\nwe saw for instance in a pilot in\nForsyth County Georgia we saw a rest go\ndown by 96 percent for this population I\nthink it's important that we understand\nthat that's important\nwe have another question we're going\nfrom a new member who had a great\nquestion to the dean of this house\nchairman Gerald Green for a question the\ngentleman's recognized thank you thank\nyou Mr Speaker to the representatives in\nthe well I guess that's the way to\napproach that\nI think\nuh is it not true that\nchairman Cooper has hit\nthe nail with a hard Hammer about\nSouthwest Georgia\nthat the sheriffs of those areas\nwere calling representative Joe Campbell\nand myself one night about 11 30 12\no'clock and saying I don't want to put\nthis person in jail but we have no other\nplace to put him\nand that goes to the heart of this\nand I want to thank you all for the work\nthat you have put forth because we have\na lot more is that not true\nthank you Dean\nGerman makes is recognized for a\nquestion to your extreme right over here\nthank you Mr Speaker to the presenter's\nyield yes I just wanted to follow up uh\nrepresentative Jones or chairman Jones\nand I've had a conversation about\nsection one of the original version of\nthe bill that is no longer in this\nversion of the bill but would ask you to\naddress that on incompetency for uh\nquickly please thank you\nchairman Meeks thank you so much there\nhas been a significant amount of\nconfusion amongst our Collective\nconstituents about I'll say today's\nversion of the bill versus the original\nversion of the bill the original version\nof The Bill had a section one that dealt\nwith a code section that is in law today\nthe challenge is it's 13 Pages or was 13\npages long and we needed to change about\n10 words but according to legislative\nCouncil we had to literally take out and\nthen put back in simultaneously so it\nseemed as if we were changing uh the\ndefinition of mental incompetency it\nseems as if we were changing the\nstandards in terms of how long they\ncould be held we were changed this we\nwere changing the standards in terms of\njuveniles adults Etc in fact that is not\nthe case at all the law as it stood on\nJanuary 9th when we were sworn in to\nthis August body was there and that law\nwill be there when we quote gavel out\ncyanide\nrepresentative Hutchinson is recognized\nfor a question thank you Mr Speaker to\nthe presenters yield\nyes is it not true that for mental\nhealth professionals like me when I go\nto hire for rural parts of Georgia such\nas Banks Stevens white counties that\nthis loan forgiveness program will be\ntremendously helpful to attract talent\nto those areas\nyes thank you very much and thank you\nfor this work it's it's wonderful\nrepresentative gamble is recognized for\na question\nthank you Mr speakers to the presenters\nin the well do you yield yes\nisn't it true that house bill 520

questions that I'm getting\npretty consistently from back home is\ndoes this create any type of additional\ntax burden for the taxpayer\nthe short answer of that is no no there\nis no new tax burden on a taxpayer in\nany of the 20 sections\nand if we could save just 20 percent of\nthe money we spend on multiple\nincarcerations multiple ER visits and\nmultiple law enforcement interactions we\nwould be ahead of the game\nthank you I appreciate the response\nwe have one more question and I want to\nrecognize represent representative Wade\nfor a question to your right inner\ncareer\ndid

David\nRalston is smiling down on this body\nright now\n[Applause]\nthank you for your courage\nMr clerk will you read the caption tool\nto house bill 470-470.\nHouse Bill 470 by representative Cooper\nthe 45th and others to be entitled an\nact to amend chapter 12 of title 24. the\nofficial go to Georgia annotated\nrelating medical and other confidential\ninformation so it's allow for voluntary\nopen Communications related Health Care\nUnder The Rules of Evidence this bill\never referred to the committee on\nJudiciary that committee recommends that\nthis bill\ndo pass\nchair recognizes chair lady Sharon\nCooper to present the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker ladies and\ngentlemen of the house this afternoon\nyou're going to be voting on several\nother tort reform bills that are coming\nforward\nand House Bill 470 known as the Georgia\nCandor act brings a little bit of a\ndifferent approach to tort reform\nbut a part of that of those that are\ngoing to be presented today\nwe have a current system of Shame and\nblame\nwhen there's been an adverse Health Care\noutcome and that has led to deny\ndefend delay and litigation\nCandor is a significant step in changing\nthat culture\nto what of working together in a\nstraightforward honest and transparent\nmanner to help the patient find a timely\nand positive resolution for themselves\nand since I'm talking about the fact of\npeople working together\nI want to thank the Georgia trial\nlawyers\nMr Snipes and Jordan I want to thank a\ngroup of citizens related and you know\npart of the medical community that came\ntogether\nand also the hospital Association that\nover the past two and a half years we\nhave worked on this issue so it's truly\nworking together for the betterment of\nGeorge's\nlet me tell you it's a briefing what\nhappens in Candor if there is an adverse\nHealth Care outcome\non a prompt matter you know the hospital\nwould notify or the or the doctor the\npatient and ask them if they wanted to\nparticipate in Candor\nif they did they would be strongly\nencouraged to get an attorney to\nrepresent them\nthe hospital or the doctors they would\nhave their attorney\nthey would meet together\nand in a manner of transparency the\npatient would get their records if it\nwas a doctor and had made a mistake they\nwould admit their mistake you know and\nthen and express their remorse for it\nhappening and believe it or not most\ndoctors if they ever make a mistake or\ncome close really are truly remorseful\nand it hangs over their head\nand they would try to come to a\nresolution\nin a more timely manner litigation is\nextremely expensive and it can take\nthree four five years to come to a\nconclusion for a patient what does the\npatient do during that time\nand the litigation bills are extremely\nand that causes many people who are\nharmed\nto be unable to resolve their problems\nbecause what happened to them\nwould never rise to the to where they\nwould have enough money in recovery\nto make it worthwhile what it cost to\nbring their complaint to litigation\nso when they do candor\nit is not in the court system\nthey meet together they discuss what has\nhappened and they try to come to a\nresolution where a settlement can be\noffered there and they do it in a timely\nmanner there's a hundred and five a\nhundred and\nI've lost it 150 days\n150 days from the time the incident\nhappened\nor they should have known it happened to\nhave been heard for them to enter into\ncandor\nif they do that then they try to come to\nresolution in 60 days\ncan you imagine coming to a positive\nsolution and having a settlement in that\nshort period of time\ntakes longer if it takes longer to get\nthe hospital records if the patient in\nthe hospital or the patient the doctor\nagreed that time can be extended\nif it's a voluntary\na procedure if the patient doesn't want\nto do it they don't have to if the\nhospital doesn't want to do it they\ndon't have to if the doctor doesn't want\nto it is strictly voluntary but if they\ndo enter into candor\nlet's say they decide that they're not\ngetting resolution they can leave at any\ntime and proceed with litigation\nthe doctor or the hospital can drop out\nand what Candor does if they do that\neverything that has been said in Candor\ncannot be used in the court process\nthis is what Candor does it will not\nwork in every situation but I can tell\nyou one of the states that's had Candor\nworking now for about a year and a half\nhas done well over a hundred cases where\nCandor was used\nand all but three of them\nwere they were resolved and and you know\nand came to a resolution and the patient\nand issue was resolved and only three\nwent on to litigation\nthis is not a Panacea it's one tool in\nthe toolbox to change our culture and\nwith that Mr Speaker I will answer a few\nquestions\nand I hope everybody will remember I'm\nnot a lawyer and I might have to have\nhelp from\none of our lawyers in case you get real\ntechnical\nthe lady yield for a question if I need\na lawyer help me\nrepresenting Becky Evans to your left\nhas a question\nthank you Mr Speaker does the gentlelady\nyield\nthe lady will yell yes\num yeah I just want to ask what state\nwas that and is this a term if we look\nup like if we wanted to if we wanted to\nsearch on Candor yes you can you can you\nwould see other states where where and\nyes where this has been done and then\nwhat was the other state you were\nreferring to just I was referring to\nColorado okay and I will tell you it's\nuh it's in three states now that have\npassed it since other states are\nconsidering it\nColorado and Iowa pass Candor with no\ndissenting votes one of those States is\nRepublican the other one is Democrat and\nthey pass Candor with no dissenting\nvotes\nat the for that election it's coming\ntogether to help patients it also helps\nour doctors when we talk about trying to\nkeep our doctors nothing weighs more\nheavily on a doctor than to have the\nthreat of a lawsuit hanging over their\nhead and it helps to lead to burnout\nit's not the total call cause but they\nwill tell you that it does add to their\nwish to quit and not practice as long\nand certainly you know patients that go\nyou know with something unresolved I\nwill tell you now I still have feelings\nabout Tom's death I think there was a\nproblem I wasn't after money but if we\ngo through this and we look back I have\nunresolved issues about what happened in\nhis last hospital admission and I'm a\nnurse so I know a lot about it\nand I would have appreciated being able\nto enter into a Candor discussion about\nwhat happened and I think if you ask\nyour friends and family there many of\nthem will tell you that they have things\nhappen to them that have been unresolved\nand that still concern them\nlady yield for another question yes sir\nchairman Martin Newton to your right has\na question\nThe gentlelady Guild I will\nis it not true that I have great respect\nand appreciation for your work on this\nand and the medical field in general\nreally loves the idea of a an\nalternative to the adversarial role that\ngoes on for years and that that your\nwork on this is going to make a great\noption against that adversarial policy\nto try to allow both patients and\ndoctors\nto learn and to move on and make things\nsafer for all thank you and and that's\nthat's one Posse things\nabout resolving for the patient but\nthat's first and then the doctor it's\nabout changing the system so that the\nmistake is not made again what if it's a\npatient was in surgery and they needed a\nthousand CC of a certain fluid and the\nnurse goes to where that's stored and\npicks up a thousand CC bottle takes it\nback in and hooks it up to the patient\nand it's the wrong fluid and this is a\nlittle far-fetched from that because you\nknow one with sugar and one was saline\nprobably not going to cause a problem\nbut let's say the patient had a real\nadversary reaction and they were harmed\nand it kept them from working for you\nknow and they were the hospital three\nmonths or something like that so they've\nbeen affected about it and they've lost\nthing\nfinding a resolution for that patient\nbut also when that comes to light and\npeople are honest about what happened\nthen they can go look at the system and\nsay you know that could happen again we\nneed to separate those bottles and one\nneeds to be on one side of the you know\nthe room and the others need to be on\nthe other side so it's much less likely\nthat a nurse will ever pick up the wrong\nbottle again and have the same adverse\nreaction\nthank you for this legislation I look\nforward to supporting it thank you ma'am\nthank you very much for your comments\nlady yield for a couple more yes sir\nrepresented sharper to your left and the\nback thank you Mr Speaker with a\ngenerator yield yes I will is it true\nthat I was on a committee where we heard\nfrom experts all across the country and\ngot great information and I fully\nsupport this bill because I believe in\nwhat it's saying and what it can\nactually do for our citizens thank you\nrepresentative Trapper I appreciate that\nwe\nexperts we we bring we brought in people\nworking with Cantor and trying to teach\nhospitals about it because it is a\nchange and it will be an education\nprocess but we also brought and had\npeople testify who had lost one lady\nlost a child uh another another family\nmember so thank you representative\nsharper\nlady has one more question if you'll\nyield yes sir I will representative\nReese from District 140 I think over in\nColumbus area is a question thank you Mr\nSpeaker does the lady Yale I will for a\nvery good uh new member of my committee\nI will representative thank you madam\nchair isn't it true that this bill is in\na fly-by-night bill that it was some\nhard work and collaboration between the\nlegal entity and the medical entity to\npull together to a compromise that\nworked for all people and is going to\nmake this a solid Bill not only for the\nlegal field but for the medical field\nand as a practicing attorney I support\nthis Bill thank you sir that is true it\nwas a collaboration between all three\ngroups the lady has no further questions\nthank you Mr Speaker I would ask the the\nmembers for their positive vote on this\nand I will yield The Well the lady has\nyielded the well we have no speakers is\nthere any objection to the previous\nquestion being order that you're here\nhas done the previous question is\nordered is there any objection to\nagreeing to the report of the committee\nwhich was favorable to the passage of\nthe bill that chair hears none the\nreport of the committee is agreed to\nshall this bill now pass all in favor of\nthe passage of the bill will vote Yes\nall those opposed will vote no and the\nclerk will unlock the machine\nhave all members voted\nhave all members voted\nif so\nthe clerk will lock the machine\non the passage of the bill the yeas were\n163 the Nays are one\nthe bill having received the requisite\nconstitutional majority is therefore\npassed Mr clerk will you read the\ncaption to house bill 530 5 3 0. house\nbill 530 by representative 176 to be\nentitled an act to amend Article 5 or\nchapter 11 a Title IX of the official go\nto George annotated relating to\ndepositions in Discovery so as to\nprovide for protective orders for\ncertain high-ranking officers\nthis bill ever refer to the committee on\nJudiciary that committee recommends that\nthis bill do pass\nthe gentleman from the\n176th house district burchett is\nrecognized to present the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker\nand uh just got some good news my son\nhe's a wrestler and they just got new\nleotards and he sent me a picture so I\nwas just checking that out\nso\nwell uh thank you colleagues I know it's\nbeen a long day and this is not not too\nterribly uh contentious of a bill here\nuh this is House Bill 5 uh 30 I'm\nreading from LC 44 2300 what this bill\nis commonly referred to as the Apex\nDoctrine and\num what we've got here is a a very\ngentleman will suspend\nthese issues are important to Georgians\nimported to us all the gentleman will\ncontinue\nthank you Ms speaker so\nwhat we've got here is a very narrowly\ntailored compromise so that is a reform\nfor folks in civil litigation and what\nthis does is for it defines what an\nofficer is and an officer of a\nhigh-ranking organization\nlike a large corporation or a large\nDepartment need not be called in for a\ndeposition unless they have unique\nknowledge\nthe the impetus for the bill is there's\na court case out there that involved a\nlarge automaker and and that automaker\nthe CEO of that automaker was requested\nto be deposed and naturally the CEO of a\nlarge corporation here in the United\nStates or pretty much probably anywhere\nin the world has significant scheduling\nextensive scheduling\ndemand fans and unique scheduling\ndemands and for that reason unless they\nhave unique knowledge the argument was\nmade why do we got to bring the CEO in\nwhy do we have to bring the CEO in this\nthe argument they made was that you're\nbringing this Co in just a badger\nessentially Badger the company\nand what this would do would say that a\nprotective order would be issued in the\nevent that there is no unique knowledge\nfor a large for an officer of a large\ncorporation or a large department and it\ncodifies\nstatutory legislation at the federal\nlevel our Discovery rules in the state\nof Georgia are very Broad and this\nnarrows it up a little bit gives some\nprotection to the business\nCommunity this is sought after by the\nboth the chamber and many many of your\nbusinesses will be happy about this and\nand also it's a so it's narrowly\ntailored enough that the litigants will\nalso be in support of this and that's\npretty much the Crux of the bill and\num Mr Speaker I'll stand for questions\nif anybody has any questions\nforeign\nyields\nrepresentative Jasmine Clark to your\nleft has a question\nthank you Mr Speaker does the gentleman\nyield legitimate yields um so on line 45\nit says that um this will be an officer\nof an organization that is large and\ncomplex yes ma'am what\nwhat is the difference between large and\ncomplex and medium and maybe simple or\nsmall and simple I guess I'm just trying\nto figure out who would this apply to\nand who would it not apply to oh that's\nvery astute of you to find those words\nthere these words so this is part of the\ncompromise to assure that\num\nwe don't cast too broad of a net here\nthat we that you can't bring in that\nthis applies to every company so much\nlike everything in the code you would\nhave to argue what large and complex is\nI mean I think I could give I could come\nup with a\num an example for you I would say that\nGM a Fortune 500 company with I think\nyou know\ntens of thousand employees would be both\nlarge and it would be complex because it\ndoes business across the United States\nacross the world\nand I would submit to you that is as\nlarge and complex\nand so to the to the Other Extreme I\nwould submit to you that the CEO of a\nhot dog stand\nthat delivers Hot Dogs or or serves hot\ndogs would neither be large nor complex\nand this is going to be a discretionary\ndecision by the judge that two lawyers\nare going to have to stand up and argue\nis it always going to be exactly the\nsame I don't expect it will be but I\nthink that we've got to use a little bit\nof Common Sense here and understand that\nthere is a difference between you know\nthe hot dog stand and GM\ngentlemen you yield for another question\nthe gentleman yields\nchairman Bill Hitchens to your left has\na question\nnow you're ready\nwell the gentleman yield gentleman\nyields I'm about forgot what I was going\nto talk about now but uh\nno really wait a minute that might take\na long time if you forgot what you're\ngoing to talk about\ndoes this um would would this affect the\npublic and the private sector yes sir it\nwould affect the public and private\nsector so for instance uh I know the\ngentleman\nhas a history of serving the great state\nof Georgia in many capacities and in his\nformer capacity\num\nthis would protect you if you did not\nhave\num unique knowledge\nwould you further yield of course and\nand I just want to give a\nnickname of something that happened one\ntime that I it probably happened\n15 20 years ago but I had to give a\ndeficit I gave many depositions over my\ncareer but I had to give a deposition\none time about something that occurred\nabout three years before I I went into\nthat position I wasn't even in the\nagency and I always thought I was\nimproper would discover that\num if you didn't have unique knowledge\nand the court decided that you were a\nofficer of a large organization large\nand complex organization then yes it\nwould apply to you\nthank you thank you representative Roman\nhas a question right up the front\nhey does the gentleman yield gentlemen\nyields\num is it not true that this could\nprevent the deposition of Bad actors in\nhigh positions potentially eroding the\nconcept of rule of law because the idea\nis that if this is meant to stop\ndeposing people that might not have\nknowledge of something\npeople do have the concept of plausible\ndeniability so couldn't that potentially\njust serve as another tool in that\ntoolbox representative I heard like\nnothing you said I couldn't hear\nanything you said I'm sorry can you hear\nme I didn't hear you yes ma'am okay is\nit not true that this could prevent the\ndeposition of Bad actors in high\npositions potentially eroding the\nconcept of rule of law\num I I don't know if I agree with your\ncharacterization I think that under the\ncurrent law\num is is Justice always given is is the\nright decision always made I don't think\nI don't think that's we can no one here\ncan say yes or no to that question I get\nyour point\num this this hinges on\nterms of art if you have knowledge if if\nI can convince the judge that you have\nknowledge and you're an officer you have\nspecific knowledge that nobody else has\nunique knowledge to you then I should be\nable to get your deposition now if\nyou're if you're being represented by an\nattorney an attorney is astute enough to\nconvince the court that\nthe knowledge that you have is not\nunique to you and someone else could\nhave it and you qualify as an officer\nthen the information could be sought\nafter from someone else but to your\nquestion I don't think anybody can\nanswer that question\num you know honestly\nthank you Mr Speaker the gentleman has a\ncouple of questions that I'm interested\nin\nand it comes from the two members that\nsit on sit on both sides of you so I'm\nwondering I want to find out what y'all\nhaven't spoken about so I'm going to\nrecognize the majority leader of this\nhouse lead our illustration for a\nquestion\nfamous Spears Gentleman Jim and yields\nthis whip isn't it true that we often\ntalk about George the best state in the\ncountry to do business and through\nreally countless hours you have put into\nthis Apex legislation this bill helps to\nfurther that cause and that message that\nwe can send nationally and\ninternationally for our state isn't that\ntrue Mr leader I I believe that to be\nwholeheartedly true and appreciate the\nleader pointing it out to everybody\nthank you for your hard work we're the\nnumber one business to do number one\nstate to do business I almost none in\none business uh\nthat's not fair\nsorry Miss figure we we are the number\none state to do business and you know\nfor those of my friends\num in this chamber that are seeking out\nuh a day to uh\num you know have equal justice under the\ncivil litigation system in the state of\nGeorgia this is your day you should vote\nproudly with a green here and I would\nencourage you to do so\nokay you have a couple more if you want\nthem Mr Speaker\num the hour is late and I am ready as\nmany of my folks are here I'm going to\nyield the well if you don't the\ngentleman has yielded the well if you\nhad a question I didn't get to you\ncome see the whip right down front is\nthere any objection to the previous\nquestion being ordered the chair hears\nnone the previous question is ordered is\nthere any objection to agreeing to the\nreport of the committee which was\nfavorable to the passage of the bill\nthat Jerry hears none the report of the\ncommittee is agreed to shall this bill\nnow pass all in favor of the pastor of\nthe bill we'll vote Yes all

Council\nof insurance legislators recommended a\nfew changes with the new language\nincluded in this legislation\ntncs are required to carry uninsured and\nunderinsured coverage of one hundred\nthousand dollars per person for bodily\ninjury 300\n000 per accident for bodily injury and\ntwenty five thousand dollars for\nproperty damage\nlike I said this was worked on both\nsides of the aisle we had attorneys and\ninsurance companies agreeing on\nsomething they were all singing Kumbaya\nso this is a great bill we can get it\npassed and get it over across the hall\nwith that Mr Speaker I'll yield for any\nquestions\nyou have a question if you will yield\nuh yes sir representative Jasmine Clark\nto your left has a question\nthank you Mr Speaker does the gentleman\nyield yes ma'am all right so in this uh\nprocess who is the the Uber and Lyft\ndriver\nthen the lady will suspend just for a\nmoment\nback with the vibration of the\nvibration go ahead\nnow I can hear you\num there's a gentleman yield once more\nokay yeah yes\num so in this situation I just want to\nbe clear on Whose uninsured or\nunderinsured it's not the Uber or Lyft\ndriver correct that is correct it is a\nper the person in the car with them the\npurse the person in the car is uninsured\nor under they're uninsured or\nunderinsured the motorists because no no\nyou're right I'm sorry the Lyft driver\nyes because Lyft is required to carry\nthat coverage on them and this is making\ntheir rates seem to be higher and we're\nhoping you know once we get this bill\nimplemented this will help with our\nrates as well so\nUber and Lyft can hire drivers without\nproving that they are insured\nwell it's underinsured and insured\nmotorist and this is just helping and\nwe're one of 42 States\num of the 42 States we're one of the\nworst ones for this because we're\ncovering that a million dollars and what\nwe're seeing is we're going to cover\nthem down to 300 000 instead of a\nmillion if something were to happen in\nan accident like that there's still a\nmillion dollar for the regular but for\nthe uninsured or underinsured it's a\nhundred thousand three hundred thousand\nor twenty five thousand this was fully\nvetted in the insurance Committee in\nboth subcommittees and then we had\ntestimonies and everyone was was in\naccordance in agreement and we've worked\non this for a

official go to Georgia annotated\nrelating to Barbers and cosmetologists\nso it's a lot of individuals and\nFacilities deprived to provide blow dry\nstyling braiding threading and the\napplication of cosmetics without being\nlicensed by the State Board of\nCosmetology and Barbers this bill\nhaven't referred to the committee on\nregulated industries that committee\nrecommends that this bill do pass\nby committee substitute\nrepresentative Jenkins is recognized to\npresent the bill\ngood afternoon Mr Speaker members of the\nHouse\nI Rise to present house bill 212.\nHouse Bill 212 amends title 43 by\nrepealing and replacing chapter 10. this\nchapter relates to cosmetology and\nBarbers this bill was brought as an\nagency Bill to reorganize modernize and\nclarify current regulation\nadditional Provisions were added\napproximately line 237 to 264. these\nProvisions allow certain Niche Beauty\nservices\nto uh to be performed without licensing\nif a health and safety course is\ncompleted\nso the niche Beauty for uh services\naddressed are essentially what you do\nwhen you get up in the morning get ready\nto go\nso this is blow dry styling\nthis is the practice of washing drying\nand arranging hair this isn't cutting\nthis isn't dying this isn't using\nchemical processes to alter the\nstructure of the hair\nthreading\nis a traditional form of hair removal\nfrom South Asia in the Middle East it is\na practice of using only a piece of\ncotton thread to form loops around and\nremove unwanted facial hair makeup\napplication\nthis is the practice of applying\nCosmetics to a person's face\nso this bill actually corrects\ninconsistencies in the regulation about\nthis currently our cosmetology laws\nuh basically regulate makeup application\nbased on what you do after the makeup's\napplied so what I'll as an example for\ninstance if you're uh if you're doing\nfilm television or entertainment a\nlicense is not required if you're doing\ncosmetic counter sales a license is not\nrequired it even makes uh exceptions for\nspecial events so our this law modifies\nthat just to exclude that from licensure\nsince most practices are already\nexcluded anyway\nso these things we're talking about this\nis not the first time we've addressed\nthis back in 2006 this body Exempted uh\nhair braiding in much the same manner\nwe're doing here so this is this is uh\ninconsistent with what we've done in the\npast uh what we're doing with these\nthese certain safe practices\nso in order to do this we addressed\nhealth and safety concerns by requiring\na four-hour annual health and safety\nclass\nthese classes are approved by the\nGeorgia Board of Cosmetology it's what\nlicensed cosmetologists already take\nso this is an entrepreneur's bill this\nbill creates opportunity\nthe most likely people to benefit from\nthis bill are women\nsingle moms those who do not have higher\neducation those that can't afford higher\neducation uh people of color immigrant\ncommunities\nunder Georgia's current cosmetology laws\nto do these safe Niche practices you\nhave to complete one of three licenses\nthese licenses take between a thousand\nfifteen hundred hours of training costs\nabout seventeen thousand five hundred\ndollars so again with low income\nuh Georgians it becomes not only a\nquestion of the cost of this training\nbut also\noften the larger question is is being\nable to to devote the time to it when\nyou're trying to to make ends meet\nso these exceptions are common uh 32\nstates\nexempt these practices in some form or\nanother\num there are examples that show\nderegulation of these practices create\nopportunity\nin Mississippi once they deregulated\nHair Braiding they have 1200 registered\nbraiders Louisiana you have to have a a\ncosmetology license to do hair braiding\nthere's only 32 registered braiders in\nthe state of Louisiana so and this and\nthere is a larger African-American\npopulation in the state of Louisiana so\nthat either says that I mean what that\nmost likely says to me that these\npractices are occurring unlicensed and\nagain without any health and safety\ntraining\nso five states have had to change their\nlaws as a result of lawsuits and I just\nimplore this body not to require the\ncitizens of Georgia to to seek seek\nrelief from the Judiciary in this matter\nthis is something we can take care of\nhere and create Opportunity by creating\ngood public policy\nso I was raised by I'm the youngest of\nfive children I was raised by a single\nmother and I I know all the sacrifices\nshe had to make and and as well you know\nall the juggling she had to do from day\nto day to make ends meet you know quite\nfrequently the the dinner we ate was the\nmoney she made to to buy that for us may\nhave been earned in the last 24 hours so\nremoving\nthese barriers uh they're they're\nthey're they're liberating for for our\nlower income Georgians you know as a\nsimilar story I have I recently retired\nfrom the Army about seven years ago\nand uh I you know I have a I'm a\nhelicopter pilot but but when I retired\nI retired into a very bad job market and\nuh\nyou know the\ncomp what's common with military people\ntransitioning to the civilian world is\nyou have a skill mismatch ultimately if\nthere's an abundance of applicants the\napplicants from the civilian Community\nwill always have the experience that\nthat more closely aligns with the job\nmarket so it took me a while to\ntransition like a lot of veterans that\nwas about a year before I was able to\nget back into into my profession so\nduring this time you know although I was\nretired you know that's about a third of\nmy salary uh disability came much later\nI was in a period of having to make ends\nmeet I didn't need a new profession I\njust needed to make some money for a\nwhile and uh so I you know I had a\nbulldozer I did mechanic work I built\nfences whatever I could do and\nthankfully I had opportunity because I\nwasn't regulated out of the ability to\nto to earn a living and that's that's\nwhat we need to think about\num\nin closing this bill creates opportunity\nbirth death marriage divorce recessions\ndisability life happens these events\nparticularly affect low-income Georgians\nwhere we can we must reduce the burden\nof Occupational licensing so people have\nthe flexibility to support their\nfamilies uh you know and and here we can\npontificate how this license will help\nGeorgians and I'll tell you the answer\nto that question is about as infinite as\nthe 11 million Georgians out there uh in\nin my military career I've had the\nopportunity to live in country where\nbodies just like this make the financial\ndecisions and they decide where the\nrestaurants and the hotels and\neverything goes and you know that's\nthat's not what we do here here our job\nis to create create opportunity and I\nencourage you to do this\num in this case the liberty and the\nopportunity we create here today\nuh is not for the Georgians that have\nlobbyists out in the hallway I know we\ndo wonderful things for uh for industry\nevery day but the people we help here\nthere's no lobbyists in the hallways\nForum uh they're not as organized as\nperhaps some people opposing this their\nvoices may not ring as loud in this\nchamber but their voices are important\nand I encourage you to listen\num and and let's let's create\nopportunity here and I encourage you to\npass house bill 212.\ngentlemen yield for questions I do yield\nfor questions just for informational\npurposes\nwe have about 10 people signed up to\nspeak to the bill all right and we have\nabout\num\nI can't count that high with my shoes on\njust to have to have questions on the\nbill\nwe all recognize representing more for\nthe first question to your left\ngood evening\nisn't it true\nthat you know absolutely nothing about\na woman of Colors Hair and is it also\nnot true that I am highly offended that\nyou would want to take away a license to\npotentially would give me a disease or\npull the rest of my hair out\nokay I'm not want someone licensed okay\nso I'm not proposing taking a license\naway what was the other thing that that\nyou mentioned well that's what this bill\nis all about uh it's actually not this\nuh this building the state of Georgia\nWestern announcement if the lady will\nyield we'll have a question and the\ngentleman in the well needs to answer\nthat question\ntwo\nthat this bill would require\nwomen who spit on thread women who know\nnothing about taking care of edges and\nchemical reactions to threading and\nbraiding\nto take away a license just so that the\nstate of Georgia can make money\nso Georgia currently doesn't license\nbraiders so this bill has nothing to do\nwith that so it won't take away a\nlicense for braiding\nyou're required you're not requiring a\nlicense for it there's not a license\nrequired for braiding hair in Georgia\ntoday prior to the passage of this bill\nfrom reading this the lady has a\nquestion stated question isn't it true\nthat you're requiring no license for\nthis or for braiders or for uh stringers\nand the peep threaders who do your\neyebrows and they thread they thread\nhair they thread your eyebrows they\nthread your your mouth your chin so this\nBill does exempt threaders from\nlicensing\nRaiders are currently exempt from\nLicensing in Georgia uh currently and so\nthis bill doesn't change that you're not\ntrying to ask for a license for this\nno I'm not changing to ask for a license\nfor braiders\nand isn't it also true that you're\nasking for\nfor this bill to pass so that the state\nof Georgia can make more money off of\ndoing something that's a little illegal\nin IU\nI'm I'm not I don't understand how the\nstate of Georgia would make more money\nbut I do hope it creates opportunity\nfor Georgians to support their families\nand make more money\nyield for a question represent gentlemen\nyield I yield representative Barnes has\na question\nto your left\nthank you Mr Speaker this is gentleman\nyield I yield\nis it not true that if an unlicensed\nperson washes my hair and it falls out\nthat I\ncannot file an illegal uh\nany legal ramifications for them making\nmy hair fall out\nso if someone could wash your hair and\nmake it fall out your legal recourse\nwould be no different than than with a\nlicensed or unlicensed person\nif that was possible\ndoes the gentleman yield I yield thank\nyou\nis it not true that\nI take pride in my hair and I and I\ntake really good care of my hair and if\nan unlicensed person does not take\ncourses or classes to take care of my\nhair and my hair falls out that I can\ntake legal actions\nwell\nagain I'm sure you do take good care of\nyour hair and if if having a licensed\nperson wash your hair would make you\nfeel comfortable that's still going to\nbe a choice that you can that you can\nmake so we're not gonna we're not uh\nremoving licensure from washing hair you\ncan still choose a licensed person to\nwash your hair and if and if somebody if\nyou choose to have someone without a\nlicense wash it it really doesn't change\nyour legal recourse if if that you know\nif if if that something happens does the\ngentleman yield for one more question I\ndo thank you\num\nready will suspend\nthe member asking and the member\nanswering the question can't hear each\nother so thank you Mr Speaker we hope\nyou members will\ncertain respect this process lady will\ncontinue thank you is it not true that\nif this bill passes it not only helps uh\nlow-income single families minorities\nbut it helps everyone who wants to move\ninto this business unlicensed\nso the the the parts the things that we\nare we are exempting from license would\nwould allow them yes to do that uh\nwithout a license yes I don't know quite\nwhat you're asking there\ngentlemen Geo for another question\nI'll yell for one more representing\nMaynor to your right has a question\nthank you Mr Speaker does the gentleman\nyield I yield is it not true that this\nis definitely a complicated bill it has\nsome good points and some bad points\num do you further yield\nuh I would say I disagree that it has\nbad points but uh go ahead so the bill\ndoes not have a minimum age and so my\ndaughter Alexis who's 10\nshe thinks it will be really cute to\nopen up a parlor and wash girls hair\nbecause now she can but\nisn't it also true that that requires a\nlot of liability insurance so whether it\nwere my ten-year-old daughter or a 40\nyear old person if you're going to wash\nhair\nand it falls out as someone said and\nhopefully it won\nisn't it further true that\nliability insurance is important for\nthose things liability insurance is is\nimportant\nfurther true that this is a business\nopportunity because\none of the things that you mentioned\nearlier braiders are not licensed\nand they're also not required to take\nthat four hour course that is now\nrequired that is a current part of\nGeorgia law that this bill did not\naddress so so this this bill doesn't\naddress braiders\nI mean it's already legal for break for\nbraiders to be exempt from licensing so\nthat that is this bill does not change\nthat is it further true that if they\nwash the hair though they have to take\nthe four-hour course\nthis bill requires a health and safety\ntraining in order to practice these\nServices thank you\nso with that I Mr Speaker I yield the\nwell\nthe gentleman has yielded the well\nnow we have some speakers lined up here\nto speak to bring some clarity\nto this issue\nwe're first going to recognize chairman\nParsons to speak to the bill I'm sure he\ncan offer some insight here\nchairman Parsons\noh thank you speaker I appreciate the\nopportunity to come up here gentlemen\nyield\nthat any room's empty\nI can't see any if the gentleman will\nreceived from the well\nthe gentleman will step down from the\nwell\nMr chairman if you'll step down for a\nsecond oh I'm sorry\ny'all know I want to go home you all\nwant to go home so let's be respectful\nunless we've had a good good day\nso let's be respectful and hear the\nmember in the well and hear the\nquestions from\neveryone present here so we can move on\nwith this important issue\nI would certainly appreciate it and\nwe're going to do just that back door is\nopen that door is open\nand that one's open my mama told me not\nto point so I'm sorry but that's what\nwe're going to do let's move on Mr\nchairman you'll recognized to go back to\nthe well all right thank you speaker\nBurns I signed up to speak on this bill\nI'll be very brief when you sign up you\nhave to sign up to I mean I guess they\nalways ask you speaking in\nin favor of the bill or opposed to it\nand I know I can tell you I'm going to\nvote against it I'm not going to try to\nto influence anybody one way or the\nother the way that they vote but I would\njust say that uh you know I hadn't\nlooked at this bill I heard about the\nlast couple of days and I'm pulling out\nof the book a while ago\nand I know it went through committee I'm\na I greatly respect the committee\nprocess so I know there's been vetted in\nthe in a committee process uh so I'm not\ngoing to try at all to pick things apart\nin the bill because I know it's already\nbeen vetted but I would point out that\nit it does\num actually repeal a whole chapter of\ntitle 43 repeals it entirely so if you\nlook at the bill\nall you see is new language now I don't\nknow what the old language was you know\nif I had time and if I really wanted to\ncome up here and talk specifically about\npoints of this bill I would have I would\nhave to go pull the the code up and see\nwhat that current chapter says but it's\nnot in here I notice that they're\nwriting more bills like this I believe\nbut the whole bill if you look at this\nit's like 19 Pages 18 or 19 pages of new\ncode that's what it shows all underline\nnew code\nso I would just say uh\nI'm going to vote against it I would\njust uh caution anyone before you cast a\nvote to really consider this and been\nmentioned about the lobbyists down in\nthe hall\nuh\nI've never talked to any lobbyist about\nthis and I've carried some cosmetology\nbills years ago never have talked to the\nlobbyists about it but who I do talk to\nabout these a lot of times are the\nladies who have cut my hair and the\ngentleman who've cut my hair over the\nyears and they have opinions on this\nkind of thing and they they've gone\nthrough the training to either cut hair\nor to style hair or whatever and they've\ngone through either going through school\nor they've gone through a training\nprogram there at you know one of the\nstyling or barber shops themselves are\ngoing through the proper training to do\nthose things\nand I think it's very important to them\nthey're professionals\nthe people that cut your hair style your\nhair whatever it is they are\nprofessionals and they work very very\nhard\nyou know it's until at some point and\nthey didn't all come from some kind of a\nprivileged background I can tell you\nthat\nand they've gone into it and put in the\ntime put in the training put in the\nstudy\nthe experience to get their licenses\nand I think we need to take into\nconsideration that but I guess the main\nthing I would say\nif you vote Yes on it\nyou know you might have some questions\nabout it you know this weekend or next\nweek when you when you get your hair cut\ngo get it styled or whatever because\nthey don't have lobbyists out here\nthese are the young ladies and the men\nwho cut hair and style it they don't\nhave lobbyists out here those are the\npeople are going to talk to you about it\nif we do something that they that they\nfind that we've\ndone some irrational\naction down here but they didn't ask us\nto do\nI don't even know who did ask for this\nto be done\nbut I would just ask that you uh you\nthink about that\nand you might look up\nthe current language\nyou're replacing a whole paragraph like\n18 pages\nso before you vote you might want to\nthink about what it is what is it that\nyou're replacing\nand that's all I've got to say about it\nI yield well\nthe gentleman has yielded well thank you\nchairman\nrepresentative Jasmine Clark\nis recognized to speak to the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker today I Rise to ask\nyou to vote no on this bill and while I\ndo not necessarily think that the entire\nbill\num is is bad I do have several concerns\nso there are a lot of new faces in here\nso I will um I'm only saying this part\nfor those who don't know already I have\na PhD in microbiology and so I know a\nlittle bit about bacteria fungus and\nthings like that that you could possibly\ncome in contact with at a hair salon or\na nail salon or getting your makeup done\nand things like that and so one of my\nmajor concerns with this bill is the\nfact that we say certain people don't\nhave to be licensed and one can argue\nokay they're not dealing with chemicals\nthey're doing things that someone could\ndo at home so yes\num they don't they shouldn't need a life\nsince to do these things however in the\nprovision that asks for them to take a\nhealth and safety course\nthey are only required to take up to\nfour hours of health and safety ever\none else in this profession has to get\ncontinuing education credits and the\nreason why is because things change as\nthe industry change as we learn new\nthings as different things you know 20\nyears ago MRSA might not have been as\nbig of a deal as it is now when it comes\nto antibiotic resistant bacteria\nand so we want to make sure that\nindividuals are getting up-to-date\ninformation and so I think that\nsomething that is critically missing\nfrom this bill is a requirement that\nthose health and safety courses be\nrenewed ever so often I don't think\nthat's too much to ask for and I think\nwe're dealing with people's faces we're\ndealing with people's hair\nwe don't want people being subjected to\nfungal or bacterial infections on their\nfaces that can't be treated with certain\ntypes of antibiotics\nwe don't want people's hair falling out\nand these are things that could be\num these are things that we need to\nconsider when we're having people so\nintimately in contact with our bodies\nand so that's one thing that I would say\nwe need to have renewal requirements for\nthe health and safety course if in fact\nthey're going to have to take one and\nanother thing the gentleman\num in the well the sponsor of the bill\nmade an attempt to describe threading\nand he did kind of a good job so I'm not\ngoing to take that away from him however\nI have been to a threading salon\nand I'm not sure how many people in here\nhave been to a threading salon but one\nof the things that happens when they\nthread they take the thread and they\nbasically roll it up against the hairs\non your I'll just say your eyebrows and\nthen they rip that from your skin\nand so they're ripping it from the\nfollicle\na lot of times when they do that as\nthey're doing it they hold the thread\nright here in their mouth\nbefore as they're holding it\nthat\nintroduces the potential\nfor some type of bacterial or fungal\ninfection\nI think it would it's important that\nindividuals that
