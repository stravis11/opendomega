  "transcript": "All right, if y'all can start finding\nyour way to a seat, please.\nWell, who are you?\nOkay, guys. We're going to try to get\nback on schedule.\n>> We know you're excited to see your\nfriends.\nHope you enjoyed lunch. Thank you for\nbeing back quickly. Let's get back on\nschedule. Superintendent Woods\nis our next presenter. He's already got\nthe podium.\nThe mic is on. Superintendent, the the\nfloor is yours. All right. Ready to go.\nMr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, again to all\nthe members of the joint uh budget\ncommittee, it's a pleasure to be with\nyou today. Um, as we begin\nfrom my house in Tiffan, Georgia, it\nroughly takes me 12 and a half hours to\nreach a place called success. And that's\na place called success Missouri.\nAs I meet today with you, I want to\nstate that all of our 1.7 million\nstudents can reach a place also called\nsuccess. Today I will share with you a\nfew updates on the progress made on that\njourney. But more importantly, I will\nshare the steps that we need to ensure\nthat every student arrives at a\ndestination called success.\nThis journey has been one that we have\ntaken together since I took office in\n2015.\nAnd I want to personally thank each of\nyou for investing in public education.\nThank you for providing support for\nschool safety, mental health, poverty\nfunding, afterchool and summer learning,\nliteracy, teacher raises, and much, much\nmore.\nBut what are investments without\npositive returns?\nBecause of your investments, we have\nseen tangible positive outcomes for\nGeorgia students. We have positioned our\nstudents to not only arrive at success,\nbut to experience success.\nFor the eighth year in a row, Georgia's\npublic school students significantly\noutperform their national counterparts\non the SAT.\nGeorgia's class of 2025 scored 33 points\nhigher on higher than the national\naverage for public school students. In\ndoing so, they beat the reading and ro\nand and writing national average by 18\npoints and the math national average by\n14 points. For the ninth year in a row,\nGeorgia students beat the national\naverage on the ACT, outperforming the N\nnational average in reading, English,\nand science.\nWe continue to see improvement in\nGeorgia's high school graduation rate.\nLast year, we experienced an all-time\nhigh graduation rate of 87.2%\nacross the state.\nThe rise of our state's graduation rate,\nI I believe, can be correlated to our\nmove from insisting that students must\nattend a 4-year university.\nBy investing in both career tech and\nwork-based learning education\nopportunities and expanding the\ngraduation diploma options, we achieved\na 98.45%\ngrad rate for our career pathway\ncompleters.\nRelevance, practicality, and the pursuit\nof one's passion are necessary to reach\nsuccess.\nThat's why I'm calling for support or\ncontinued support to outfit CTA Labs for\nhigh demand career programs. This is a\ncrucial element of our statewide efforts\nto ensure that Georgia is the top state\nfor talent.\nRemember, we are preparing our students\nfor their future, not our past.\nAfter replacing Common Core Math with\nour new math standards, we've seen two\nconsecutive years of extremely strong\nmathematic increases in our ma in our\nmath milestone scores. In fact, several\ngrades have already recovered to\nprepandemic levels.\nThis year, we will eliminate Common Core\nreading in the state of Georgia as we\nroll out our new literacy standards and\na renewed emphasis on cursive writing.\nRegarding literacy,\nI am in strong agreement with Speaker\nBurns proposal to place a literacy coach\nin every Georgia elementary school. We\nhave seen this model work in Mississippi\nand in other states to achieve\nsubstantial reading improvement.\nThis model is also working in Georgia.\nCurrently, we have placed a school level\ncoach in all of our lowest performing\nelementary schools in the state, and the\nresults have been incredibly clear.\nWe saw a 15% improvement in reading\noutcomes in one year based on universal\nscreener results. Some schools in\nGeorgia on the Georgia milestones had\ngrade level reading increases as high as\n29%\npoints.\nThis model is only being used, however,\nin the lowest performing elementary\nschools. These coaches are only being\nfunded with federal school improvement\ndollars. Both limit the ability to reach\nall students and prevent them from\nhaving the opportunity to reach and\nexperience success.\nSchool safety remains a fundamental\nkeystone of our priorities this year.\nWith both the with the support of both\nGovernor Kemp and you, a line item for\nsafety and security funding has been\nprovided to make our schools safer.\nMoving forward, we're calling on you to\nmaintain that light item line item for\nsafety funding.\nOn the issue of distraction-free\nlegislation,\nI'm asking you to expand the K12 cell\nphone limitation to grades 912.\nThis is a recommendation that mirrors\nthat offered by the stud by the Senate\nstudy committee on social media and AI\nled by Senator Harrell. It is a priority\nof Speaker Burns as well.\nThis is both an academic and mental\nhealth issue. Studies show the negative\nacademic impact and emotional strain\nplaced on exa excessive cell phone\nscreen time usage. Both my student\nadvisory and teacher advisory councils\nconsistently rank mental health\nstruggles as the number one issue faced\nby students. In addition to the above,\nit is our duty to model appropriate\nusage of electronic devices.\nTeachers and staff must set the example.\nSchools must focus on reunification\nprocesses with parents for any unseen\nsituation.\nWith that being said, this year on my\nstudent advisory committee,\nI have a young student that was shot at\nAppalache High School.\nin listening to the student.\nI do believe that we can protect\nacademic integrity\nof the classroom and address concerns by\nboth students and parents.\nBut I do believe this process should be\nanswered by our local districts.\nI know that you share our concerns over\nfinancial crisis in Dublin City. For\nseveral months, the department has been\nworking with members of the general\nassembly, many who are in this room\ntoday, to determine the best course of\naction to prevent such an occurrence\nfrom happening again.\nYou can view a few li a full list of our\nproposals by scanning the QR code.\nto our school districts. There is no\nintent to create an overburdensome and\noverly compl compliant process that will\nunnecessarily impact\nall due to the inter irresponsibility of\na few.\nIt is simply about ensuring that\nstudents, teachers, staff and families\ndo not bear the cost of financial\nmismanagement.\nIf every student is to achieve success,\nthen they must have the correct vehicle\nto take them there. And that of course\nis our teachers. To recruit and retain\nthese individuals, we must invest in\nthem and their careers.\nI want to thank Governor Kemp for\nincluding a 2001 time supplement for\neducators in his budget proposal.\nThis is a very appreciative first step.\nTo continue this step of progress, I'm\nasking for the following. A $10,000\nsalary raise increase over the next five\nyears. An expansion of the 21-year\nteacher salary cap. A call for all\nteachers to receive a duty-free lunch\nunless they receive extra compensation.\nA guaranteed five personal days for\nteachers and classified staff.\nsupport for a statewide expansion of the\nGeorgia Department of Education's\nteacher apprenticeship program along\nwith Georgia Best, a program offering\nfree advanced degrees to eligible\nteachers.\nAnd we are advocating\ncontinuing the return to work\nlegislation that helps fill teacher\nvacancies. That legislation will sunset\nthis year if no action is taken.\nThese recommendations\nare not solely aspirations on my part,\nbut they fully align with the\nrecommendations that have come out of SR\n237.\nBoth Governor Kemp and you have taken\nhistoric action to invest in Georgia's\nteachers over the past eight years.\nI am very grateful for the steps you\nhave taken, but I am also very hopeful\nthat we will see the momentum continue\nin the years to come.\nI encourage you to review the full set\nof the 2026 legislative priorities from\nthe agency. You can access them using\nthe QR code on the screen.\nBut ultimately behind every policy\nproposal\nare students, educators, and families\nwhose lives are shaped by the choices we\nmake.\nStudents will be arriving at school\nseeking the opportunity to arrive and\nexperience success.\nWe will either derail that process\nor we will set up guard rails that will\nset that will assure a safe arrival.\nI'm asking all of us to come together\nand make success a reality for 1.7\nmillion children in the state of\nGeorgia. At this time, I'll turn this\nover to Russ Rome and he'll go over the\nQB budget. Russ.\nThank you, Superintendent Woods. Thank\nyou, Chairman Tiller, Chairman Hatchet,\nmembers of the General Assembly.\nI appreciate the opportunity to present\nthe governor's recommended uh FY26\namended budget and the FY27 budget.\nStart off Whoops. There we go. Start\noff. I want to uh kind of talk about\nsome of the items that have been put\ninto our budget and kind of give you an\nidea of where we're at with those. Um we\nwe do plan on providing a much more\nindepth analysis once the school year is\nover and we can we can start to gather\nwhere some of these districts have spent\nthese funds. Um but first off in the\nstudent support services you we we got\n$19.58\nmillion for mental health grants. Uh\nthis included 968 schools, 938,864\nstudents. Uh this was $20,000 for every\nmiddle and high school. Uh the\ndepartment provided guidance to systems\non the allowable use of funds that\nincluded contracts with local mental\nhealth agencies, contracts with\ntelemental health providers, contracts\nwith individual mental health\nprofessionals, and to purchase\ncurriculum and intervention materials.\nWe had uh a little over 15 million in\nour economically disadvantaged for\nstudents grants. Uh this reached 70\nschool systems and 94,180\nstudents uh for at risk student\ninterventions. uh to also extend\nlearning opportunities after school or\nsummer during the summer after school or\nduring the summer. Uh access to advanced\ncoursework such as AP, access to\nopportunity funding such as STEM, arts,\nand music and targeted teacher training.\nWe also had a little about 2.3 2.4\nmillion for social worker grants. This\nserved 114 school systems which\nqualified for this grant. uh this\nbasically funded uh systems that didn't\nhave enough funds to provide a school\nsocial worker. So any district that had\nless than 2475 FTEES was prrated in\namount so that each district should now\nwith these funds have a school social\nworker. We also received 12,500,000 for\nout of school grants uh which allowed us\nto fund 60 community grantees with\nawards between 25,000 and 300,000. These\ngrant allocations were awarded by the\nstate board of education in September of\n2025 and are in the district's hands.\nWe also have a little over almost $ 109\nmillion, which we're very appreciative\nin school safety and security grants,\nwhich is 47,125\nper school to 2311 schools.\nUm this these expenses for these include\nsalaries, benefits, training for\npost-certified law enforcement, cameras,\nalert systems, door controls, fencing,\ngates, and security vestibles.\nWe also got just under $7 million for\nstudent advocacy support specialists.\nThis system level position is to\ncoordinate efforts by the local school\nsystem to provide appropriate\nintervention for students with or at\nrisk for mental health services. Uh this\ndollar amount represents one half of the\nfunding outlined in House Bill 268 of\nthe 2025 session. Um and it is half the\nfunds because due to the job description\ndeadline which was December 31st of\n2025, we reached this deadline. We have\nprovided the job description to the\ndistricts and we have alerted them that\nit's now available for reimbursement.\nAll right. Next up, I want to talk about\nthe state's largest expenditure QBE. And\nin order to talk about that, I have to\ntalk about the largest cost driving\nfactor, which is our full-time\nequivalent student or FTE. These are\nobtained each uh March and October in\nstudent counts provided by the\ndistricts. These counts record the\nactual class the students are attending\nfor six segments of the school day.\nThere are 18 different QB programs and\nQB is weighted uh funding formula based\non cost differentials of each one of\nthese programs.\nThis next slide just shows the the FTE\ncollection process. I won't go through\nall that.\nThis next slide is our FTEEs from FY19\nto amended 26. When I first saw the\nnumbers, I they kind of jumped out at\nme, too. As you you'll note in 2026\ncalculation, uh there is a reduction of\nFTEEs of just over 34,000 or 1.95%.\nThe state has not seen a reduction in\nFTEEs at this high since COVID in 2021.\nAs you can see, when we had an FTE\nreduction of just over 36,000 students,\nwhat we what we noticed is based by\nprogram is that most of these FTE\nreductions were in the three uh general\nschool whether elementary, middle, and\nhigh school. We did see some increases\nin some of the higher cost area, but\noverall it was an FTE decline and it was\nacross districts. It wasn't we we\nresearched, we checked to make sure it\ndidn't pinpoint certain districts to\nkind of find out this is an across\ndistrict FTE decline\nsystems indicated when we reached out to\nthem to find out as you can imagine with\n34,000. We wanted to make sure the\nnumber was right before we came to you\nguys. Um what indicate indicated the\ndeclining enrollment? There was not one\nspecific item as actually several uh\ncontinued birth rate declines impacting\nkindergarten class sizes. Uh aging\ncounting population uh including empty\nnest households not moving out due to\nthe housing market uh increased private\nand homeschool attendance.\nI included this next slide to kind of\ngive you an idea as one of the key\nfactors with the kindergarten outpac uh\nthe 12th graders exiting outpacing the\nkindergarteners entering. As you can see\nin 2011,\nwe had a lot more kindergarters coming\nin than we had 12th graders graduating.\nAnd that has slowly declined all the way\nto the FY 26. As you can see, there's a\npretty good differential now in students\nleaving versus the kindergarteners\ncoming in.\nAll right. Now, I want to talk about\nsome of the uh highlights in the amended\nFY26 and 27 budget. Um,\nfirst off, we got 300 just under 367.7\nmillion in our amended fiscal year\nbudget. As the superintendent mentioned,\nthis is for a $2,000 one-time salary\nsupplement. Uh this supplement funding\ndoes include FICA and it is the same\nmethodology as the supplement that we uh\ngot in amended fiscal year 2024 and it\ndoes include classroom teachers, central\nand school administrative positions,\nnonQB teachers and staff, lunchroom\nworkers, custodians, bus drivers.\nWe're also very appreciative that QB has\nbeen fully funded out of seven of the\nlast eight years.\nThere's funding in there for 270 new\nschool buses and just over 38.5 million\nin pupil transportation operational\nfunding which keeps that percentage\naround the 40% that was established in\nprior years.\nWe got an additional 750,000 in high\ndemand career equipment grants for a\ntotal appropriation now of $2 million.\nthe CTA program. When this funding came\nin, the original 1.25 million, we\nreceived 199 applications, including\nabout 20.4 million. We awarded 17 awards\nfor 1,250. This 750,000 will assist us\nin awarding some more applications. The\ncommon uses for these funds were\nindustry grade equipment and labs,\nsoftware and technology, credentiings\nand certifi credentiing and\ncertification, workbased learning\nexpansion and recruitment and student\nengagement.\nIn our amended fiscal year 26 budget, we\nalso received 750,000 for mental health\nservices reimbursement maximization\nproject.\nAnd as I mentioned earlier, the 109 just\nunder 109 million in continued support\nfor school security.\nAll right, up next I'll mention a couple\nof the F amended FY26 budget\nrecommendations. As you can see in the\nmidterm adjustment for growth of just\nover 43 million. Uh this is due to, as I\nmentioned in that FTE slide, a lot of\nwhile there was a decline in the\nelementary, middle, and high school,\nthere was some increases in some of the\nhigher cost areas. And as most of you\nknow, with the amended budget, districts\nare held harmless for the FTE decline.\nThat's why there's a $43 million\nincrease. Um there's a little over 14\nmillion for this special needs\nscholarship fund. This is a uh projected\namount based on the first two quarter\npayments. We make these payments\nquarterly and then project it out. And\nwe'll need an additional 14.4 million to\nfinish out the year and provide those\nscholarships. And then I'll uh mention\nthe uh social worker grant the 1.3 as I\nmentioned earlier. Uh this grant is the\nadditional funds needed in order to\nensure that we keep funding one social\nworker in each district.\nIn our FY27,\nI'll mention a few of these\nrecommendations.\nUm the enrollment growth and training\nand experience of just over 9.2 million.\nUm in years past uh with a relatively\nfat flat uh FTE count we would have\nprobably been standing up here asking\nfor you know two 300 million. So that is\nsignificantly lower due to the FTE\ndecline. Uh the special needs\nscholarship another 14.4 a little over\n14.4 million. We're very appreciative of\nthe governor putting this in the base.\nUh this amount\nuh has not been adjusted in several\nyears. So this will significantly reduce\nthe amount we have to come back and ask\nfor in the midterm. And then the state\nhealth uh benefit plan per member per\nmonth um just under 200 million that is\nto increase the per member per month\nfrom 1885 to 2028 per person effective\n71 2026\nthe I won't go through this slide most\nof these items that are other\nsignificant are 27 or were in the\npresentation earlier\nand the last item that I have on here is\nthe U for the amended and the FY27 seven\nbudgets. We are going to be asking for\nan additional amount of 1.4 million for\nthe AP and the PSAT tests. Uh we were\ngiven 750,000 in FY26 for increased AP\nand PSAT exams which gave us about 5.67\nmillion. We did receive the invoice for\nPSAT which is 1.42 million, a little\nless than what we had in the budget for\nthe PSAT. However, we're projecting an\nincrease to 5.62 62 million for AP\nexams. So with the savings of the PSAT\nand the uh with the additional expense\non the AP exam, we need another 1.4\nmillion in order to provide um the\ndistricts with one AP exam for all STEM\nstudents and for free and reduced lunch.\nThat's all I have. Thank you.\n>> Thank you all. All right. I want to\nremind everybody, we're really glad\nthere's so many people here, so many\nmembers of the committee and others that\naren't members of the committee. And I\njust want to remind you that today,\nbecause we're running behind and a lot\nof questions, we're only taking question\nfrom members of the committee. That\ncould change tomorrow and Thursday\nbecause sometimes\nthe non-members may be the only ones\nhere. Um, so that being said,\nuh, Representative Ballard\nOkay. Um, thank you, Superintendent. Um,\nthis fall at a conference, um, you said\nthat you'd heard a lot of noise about\nthird grade reading, but we had a\nreading proficiency rate of 65%.\nYet, I'm looking at the milestones\ndashboard and it said proficient 20 for\nthird grade. proficient 24%\ndistinguished 11%. So that's 35%.\nSo what are the discrep what's the\ndiscrepancy in those numbers?\n>> I would have to I mean the numbers I've\nlooked at again is specific your reading\nsome of the information again I have to\nlook at the dashboard you know really is\na combination of of ELA scores as a\ncomposite score. So that may be what\nwhat's being referenced. Uh again\naccording to Dr. for Timberlake. The\ninformation that that I've been\npresented with, the proficiency rate for\nthird grade, just looking at reading,\nyou know, should be around 65%.\n>> Okay. Well, maybe you want to look at\nyour dashboard because it doesn't say\nthat.\n>> Okay,\n>> Chairman Higgman.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr.\nSuperintendent.\nThis is not a direct budget question. I\nthink we can't let this meeting go by\nwithout go without talking about the\nDublin city school system.\n>> Sure.\n>> And the travesty that's happened there\nand the back behind and the fact that\nthey there they were 14 months behind in\nstate health plan benefit payments. I\nknow we've had some great discussion on\nthat. Would you kind of bring the bring\nthe group up to get up to date on what's\nhappened with Dublin city schools and\nand then also what is the projected\ndownfall or shortfall for June 30th this\nyear for them.\n>> Okay. Rusk, I'll let you kind of address\nDublin City.\n>> Yeah, thank you, sir. Um, yeah, I don't\nwant to mess up my dates, but I want to\nsay it was back in August, we were\nalerted around that time frame of a\nsignificant deficiency in the Dublin\nCity School System, uh, specifically\naround their state health benefit plan.\nUm, I believe they owed around 7.4 4\nmillion which was a combination of both\nuh employee and employer contributions\nfor uh since the beginning of 25 and\ninto to FY 2026\nbefore we made our first meeting they\ndid catch up all their employee\ndeductions\num which has caused so they were now at\naround 6.5 6.6 six million in state\nhealth benefit plan. When we first went\nout to the district, we were projecting\nand started looking at their books, we\nwere projecting close to a 10 10.3\nmillion, I think was the original um\ndeficit\nand some significant staffing issues. Um\nwe've been working with the district.\nWe've got, I believe,\nThere you go. You got it.\n>> Mark, we got doctor on the way. And\nwe've got uh\nback to your seats. Obviously,\nwe're blessed in the general assembly to\nhave quite a few medical professionals.\nAnd so\nthe medical emergency you just witnessed\nwas obviously attended to by three\nphysicians within a less than a minute\nfor\nthank you for your courtesy and allowing\nus to to take the obviously necessary\nbreak. But um as you know the general\nassembly is is blessed to have many\nmedical professionals in our midst and\nand those of you who witnessed this just\nnow realize that there were four medical\ndoctors around the individual within\nless than a minute. So we are blessed uh\nto have a citizen legislature who has a\nlot of expertise and I'm really thankful\nfor those medical professionals who were\nhere.\nJust take a brief moment of silence.\nThank you all.\nCommissioner Woods was um and Mr. Russ,\nsorry for the interruption.\nUm I honestly don't remember if we were\nasking a question or you were answering\na question.\n>> City Dublin city question. So I was kind\nof giving a brief.\n>> That's a good one to fall out on.\nCan we say next question? No, that's all\nright. Just\n>> um Okay, as I was saying, I think um\nthey had about 6.6 6 million in SHBP\nwhich uh sparked us to get in there and\nas as we got started to uncover we\nuncovered a lot worse. It was anywhere\nfrom 10 to 12 million in a de a cash\ndeficit. Um they were also behind in\nseveral audits. Um we have employed five\nteam members from the department of\neducation and they've been there ever\nsince to assist with uh with these.\nWe've had numerous meetings with the\nlegislature to kind of keep everybody\ninvolved. And what what uh we've been\nworking through with our the\nsuperintendent's goal, you know, was to\nmake sure that students finished the\nschool year and the teachers got paid.\nUm, with that being said, um, we did\nwork very hard next to the the current\nDublin city, uh,\nand with the current Dublin city staff\nto, uh, help them identify areas that\ncould be reduced to try to reduce this\nthis uh, significant deficit. Um, we uh,\nthey renegotiated their repayment plan\nof the $6.5 million. So, they start in\nFebruary, actually next month, on a\n24-month repayment plan of the employer\nportion that they owe for FY25. They\nhave been current on their FY26\nuh state health benefit plan reductions.\nUm they instituted numerous cuts, as I\nsaid, um some extremely necessary, some\nkind of harder to swallow. But um with\nall that being said, they should finish\nthe uh current fiscal year with about a\n$2.3 million surplus. Now, that number\nchanges monthto monthth as we provide\nadditional documentation. Now, when I\nsay they're $2.3 million surplus, we I\nalways preface that by saying they're\ngoing to need those funds to operate\nnext year as well. So, they they um one\nof the items we did advance QB funding\nto them. So, they still have one more\nmonth of QB funding, but it should\ncoincide with their property tax\nrevenues coming in. So,\n>> is there any other specifics?\n>> There's He's got a couple other\nquestions and we're going to try to\n>> that I'll sorry Senator H. I think what\nhe was asking you was u we know this\nhappened at one system, there's 181\nothers. Do we expect this will happen\nanywhere else?\n>> We do. We have received the\nreconciliations from the state health\nbenefit plan. Um we have reviewed all\noutstanding balances. There were a\ncouple of districts that um did have\nsome significant uh deficiencies.\nHowever, none none of them were even in\nthe realm of the Dublin city one. The uh\none of the other districts, I won't\nmention by name, but they already had a\nrepayment plan which actually should be\ncompleted this March. Um the other\ndistrict it was a\nuh they had sent the payments but they\nweren't cash. So we're we're working\nwith the state health benefit plan to\nclear up those reconciliations. I do\nalso know that in meetings with I think\nthe superintendent has released some\nfinancial priorities earlier in the\nslide that could also address that we're\nsuggesting to help you know mitigate\nsituations like this in the future.\n>> Representative Hugley.\n>> Thank you Mr. Chairman. Uh thank you all\nfor the presentation. Um\neach time that we do something for\nemployees, our local school districts\ncome back to us because not all of their\nemployees are covered by what we do. So\nwho are we leaving out with this $2,000?\nUh so I'll know what I'm going to hear\nwhen I go home.\nI believe we just got the documents from\nthe governor's office to who and we're\nkind of sifting through them, but as I\nstated on that the other slide, it\nappears everybody that you know I do\nthink there was some folks that might\nhave been left off back in the 24 that\nwe learned from and that we've tried to\npick up. So\nnot specific, you have a specific area,\nI could answer that, but\n>> So let me just ask you then. Are\ncustodians included on here? I see\nnurses, nutritional workers, bus\ndrivers. Are custodians included on\nhere?\n>> Okay.\n>> Uh the on the AP exams, how many are we\nallowing for?\n>> I'm sorry.\n>> Your AP exams, how many are we allowing\nour students to take?\n>> So, it's one free AP exam for all free\nand reduced lunch students and then one\nuh free STEM class for all students. And\nsuperintendent mentioned uh contracted\nemployees would not be considered.\n>> Contract employees are not. Okay.\n>> Uh one last thing. Um you\ntalked about the number of private\nschools students have increased and\nhomeschool students have increased. Can\nyou send us those numbers?\n>> Yes, ma'am. We can do that.\n>> Thank you very much,\n>> Senator Burns.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Uh thank you,\nSuperintendent. appreciate your work. My\nquestion relates to virtual education\nsecondary level. Can you tell me how\nmany virtual students we have in grades\nK through three and do you feel that\nvirtual education is appropriate at that\ngrade level?\n>> At that time we'd I'd have to get the\ninformation. I don't have that on\nRussia. You have we'd have to document\nthat. I know depending which areas. I\nmean we have a very large um charter\nvirtual school that's out there. So we'd\nhave to see if we could document those\nnumbers and plus the numbers we have. So\nwe'll get those to you. U I think\nvirtual again is it for everyone? No,\nit's not. And I think you have to kind\nof look at what are what are the um u\nresults that we are seeing. Uh for some\nof those we could see the milestones\ntesting. So again we do have some\ndocumentation that we can rely on that.\nUh but it's a it's an individual call.\nIt's onetoone with that. But uh really\nit ultimately comes down what type\nprogram is being offered because all\nvirtual programs are not equal.\n>> Chairman Irwin,\n>> thank you chairman. Um first of all, Mr.\nSuperintendent, thank you for work with\nour students and uh our our future I\nwill tell you with those students. Um I\nwant to step back for a minute. I'm in\nagreement with the leadership degree\noverhaul that that we need and that and\nlooking at the tiered system that we\nhave by which they attain that\nleadership. Um have you done any look at\nyour recommendation on the compensation\nabout how much that would be so that I\ncan figure some return on our\ninvestment?\nDo we have any on that on the staff\nincrease?\n>> How many uh\ncurrent\nleaders that have degrees\n>> that are not getting compensated?\nSo, what would that cost us when we\nstart compensating them and they're not\na leader yet?\n>> Again, we might have to check with\nPSC or Brett, see if we can get that\ninformation off hand. Uh because again\nto say how many individuals who\ncurrently have a degree this is what\nyou're talking about but are not\nprobably in leadership and getting paid\nfor leadership. Would that\n>> is that correct?\n>> About a thou okay Mr. Rome says about a\nthousand educators.\n>> See that also indicates that we're going\nto have a shortage somewhere down the\nline because we just don't have enough\nthat have that certification to be able\nto step into it.\n>> You you're correct. What's that?\n>> Uh let's see. Let's see. Go ahead. share\nwith you\n>> and the cost is just under $8 million.\n>> Okay.\n>> But to to your point about the you know\nthe the deficit of of leadership again\nthat is a very uh large reality we face\nover the past several years. We've seen\na high turnover in our our local\nsuperintendent. Um so again that means\npeople are rolling up. We continue to\nhave deficits especially at the\nprincipal assistant principal level as\nwell.\nSuperintendent, I know you asked for\n$10,000 pay raise across the next few\nyears. What What is average teacher pay\nin Georgia now?\n>> Um the average I know the starting\naverage is about 43 44,000\n>> starting what's the average though?\nObviously\n>> we have\n>> just over 70\n>> 70,000. Okay. Just over 70,000 would be\naverage.\n>> That's what we thought it was right at\n71,000.\n>> Okay. Um thank you. There are a lot more\nquestions. As you know, we're a half an\nhour behind right now. We're going to\ntry to catch up with it. So, please try\nto grab the superintendent on your way\nout. Uh, while the next presenter is\ncoming up, thank you so much,\nsuperintendent.\n>> Thank you, sir. While the chancellor's\ncoming up, I do want to take a m minute\nto remind you of something that the\nsuperintendent showed you. Our student\ncount is decreasing, but we're going to\nbe going up $43 million in the QB\nformula because we hold schools harmless\nas people are moving in and out of\ndifferent school systems. Keep that in\nmind as you debate things for the next\nfew weeks.\nI would like to remind anybody if\nthey're standing, do not lock your\nknees.\nPlease lock. Don't lock your knees. Come\non up, Chancellor.\nGood afternoon,\nChairman Tiller, Chairman Hatchet,\nmembers of the committee. I appreciate\nthe opportunity to stand before you\ntoday to talk about our university\nsystem of Georgia. Also want to thank\nyou for the investment that you've made.\nThank Governor Kemp for the all that the\nsteady support of USG. And I think\nthings that I follow, you're going to be\nvery proud of the investment that you've\nmade to help us to teach and conduct\nresearch and uh serve communities and\npartner with employees and more Georges\nso they can thrive and our state can\nthrive as well.\nYou probably know that the University\nSystem of Georgia is one of the largest\nstate public education systems in the\ncountry. 25 institutions that serve\nevery region of our state. And simply\nwhat we do is straightforward. Educate\nstudents, meet workforce needs,\nstrengthen communities, and steward\ntaxpayer dollars responsibly. So, we're\nfocused on how we can better serve the\npublic, be more efficient, and\ndemonstrate value, which is, I believe,\nis what you all are after with investing\nthe taxpayer dollars of Georgia. So,\nwhen we talk about higher education,\nwe're talking about opportunity for the\nstudents, the families, and the credit.\nAnd I want you to know that the credit\ngoes to you. The word you see on the\nscreen is probably one you're going to\nhear a little bit this year. It's the\nWebster definition of the word of the\nyear, affordability in that regard. And\nI want to show you all what you all have\ndone to make higher education in the\nUniversity System of Georgia affordable\nfor its students over the last several\nyears in that way. We're talking about\naffordability.\nIn the national conversation, you often\nhear here in Georgia and nationally that\neducation, higher education costs too\nmuch. And to some degree that is uh\nthat's\nprobably a concern that many people\nhave. But I want to show I want to give\nyou the facts today about how the wise\ninvestment you all have made how it has\naffected the students from Georgia here.\nWe worked long hard the board of regents\nhas worked hard to keep tuition and fees\nin check. The board of regents has held\nthe line on tuition for most instate\nundergraduates in seven of the past 10\nyears. And with yours and Governor\nKemp's help, we've eliminated the\nspecial institution fee, thereby\nreducing the cost for Georgians to earn\ntheir degree. I've sat where you sat and\nmany times I thought as as you move\nforward, agencies move backwards and\ncontinue to want more. And I want to\nshow you some numbers today that show\nyou that I believe the border regents\nand uh the system of Georgia has\nactually stepped forward with you in\ngetting a better value for that. When\nyou look at the\non the screen, these numbers on the\nscreen, those are facts there. And the\ngood news is we've been working on that\nfor years because we take our\nresponsibility seriously to be good\nstewards of your taxpayer dollars and\ndeliver real value for Georgia families.\nIn that regard, on this slide, you can\nsee that the tuition and fees from TW\n2021 today. I imagine if you in your\ndistricts, you said, \"Do you believe\nyour students are paying more for\ntuition fees today than in 21?\" I\nimagine the answer would be\noverwhelmingly yes. These are the facts\nbased on the Department of Audits there.\nThey've got the report, but honestly, I\nthought I'd give all of you this handout\nbecause you can respond to your\nconstituents who talk about the cost of\nour education has gone up. The cost of\nliving has definitely gone up.\nObviously, food, transportation,\ninsurance, health care, all those things\nhave gone up. housing, room, board,\nthose have gone up. Well, your tuition\nand fees based on what you all\nappropriate over the last seven years.\nThese are the facts on the screen we're\nhere today. So, we're trying to help\nstudents keep lower lower cost by\nfinishing faster as well. I know that uh\nseveral of you asked about with the\ninvestment that you are all making in\nthe dual enrollment, how has that\naffected the return on investment for\nour university system? We're we're\ncontinually asking our presidents, what\nis your under four graduation rate for\nyour dual enrollment students? And that\nwe just finished 25 budget hearings last\nFriday and many of those were reporting\nuh graduation years of under four under\nfour years for their dual enrollment\nsystem. So we're trying to harvest that\ninvestment that you're making in dual\nenrollment that come on and metriculate\nin our university system as well. So\nreducing total cost strengthen the\nreturn on your state's investment and\nthat will guard. So as we focus on\naffordability, efficiency and degree\ncompletion, our efforts in workforce\ndevelopment keep Georgia's talent\npipeline strong and set graduates up for\nsuccess. I've long said since even since\nGovernor Miller started and with the\nhope scholarship that as higher\neducation goes, Georgia follows two\ngenerations later. And because of\nGovernor Kemp's continued investment\nhere and recruiting jobs, talent has\nbecome the key word and the and the\ncount to talent to workforce is what we\ndo and we take it very seriously. Across\nUSG, every campus plays a role in\nGeorgia's competitiveness from research\nbreakthroughs to teacher preparation to\nwork for work workforce aligned\ncredentials to nursing and healthcare.\nEmployers tell us they need talent. They\nalso need problem solvers who can\ncommunicate, adapt, and think\ncritically. We're committed to producing\ngraduates who can do both. In fact, you\nmay have heard me tell our presidents\nthat the degree that I'm most interested\nin is an FIO degree. And they say,\n\"Well, I've never heard of that. What is\nthat degree?\" I said employers and the\ncommunities and the come tell me they\nwant students who can come out walk that\nstage and come to work on Monday with a\nfigure it out degree and that's what\nwe're trying to train our schools across\nthat figure it out how you can think and\ncontribute to the challenges and\nsolutions in the workforce so it's when\nwe educate talent here that talent's\nmore likely to stay here as you know and\nthat's how communities and businesses\ngrow together so the impact is\nmeasurable immeasurable USG represents\nIt generates a $23.1 billion economic\nimpact and supports more than 168,000\njobs statewide. The return return for\nstudents here is clear as well. Our\nbachelor's degree earned about $1.4\nmillion more than a lifetime than they\nwould with a high school diploma. That's\nnot our numbers. That's kind of uh uh\nprofessor Jeffrey Hump, Dr. Jeffrey\nHumphers of the University of Georgia\nand his economic output every year. It's\nstill and growing $1.4 million career\nearnings over a lifetime. So, here's a\nheadline that ma matters most for\nGeorgia's workforce in our budget\nenrollment. And you can see that\nnationally, Georgia colleges are\ncompeting for fewer traditional age\nstudents and you saw that in the\nprevious report about high school\ngraduates and kindergarteners starting.\nYou've heard about the demographic\ncliff. Our solution to the demographic\ncliff is is uh mar is uh getting more\nmargin, more market in there and getting\nparticularly adult learners coming back\nthat have maybe have some credits, some\ndebt and no diploma. Those are the 1.4\nmillion Georgians that we're also trying\nto recruit to finish their degrees as we\ngo forward. This fall we en enroll more\nthan 380,000 students across our\ninstitutions. That's a record. That's\nmore than 17,000 students above last\nfall's total and a yearover increase of\n4.8%.\nThat's in the light of the democratic\nclip demographic cliff that began last\nlast summer. We're also being growth\namong firstear students, transfer\nstudents, dual enrollment students, and\nas well as adult learners. Part of the\nsuccess is due to the funding that you\nall did for Georgia Match, which helps\nstudents understand their options and\nencourages them to take the next step.\nThose students who may not have even\nthought they could attend college or\ncompete have now tried it and over\nincreased over 10% of our applications\nlast last year. These will be productive\nstudents who are successful going\nforward. So USG is meeting students\nwhere they are offering clear clear\npathways to and credentials and degrees.\nEnrollment growth is not just a victory\nlap. I want to stress that we we've kind\nof grown out of the COVID downturn, but\nwe don't think enrollment is just the\nvictory lap. That's not where we're\nasking. It's our responsibility because\nwhen we get them in the door, when more\nstudents say yes to USG, we must deliver\non student success, affordability, and\ncompletion. That means progression from\nthe first year to the second year.\nmoving on from the second to the third\nand then from the third to that diploma\nin the fourth year in that way.\nI know many people like to talk about\nsix-year graduation rate. I'm kind of a\nfour-year graduation rate guy. So,\nthat's what we're telling the presidents\nas well. And that means 15 hours per\nsemester for eight semesters. See you.\nHere's your diploma. Go to work. Our our\ngoal is not only to enroll students, but\nour goal is to graduate them in fiscal\nyear 2025. USG institutions regard\nrecorded a record 82,67\ndegrees, a 7.9%\nincrease in degrees, the largest\nyear-over-year rise we've seen over the\nlast decade. That is the goal. In fact,\nsome of our presidents have diplomas in\nall of their faculty's offices showing\nthat is the goal. As students come in\nfor meetings, look there. I'm glad\nyou're here. We want you to have a good\ntime and a great campus experience, but\nthat's the objective. If you don't\nfinish up with a diploma, we've not\nwe've not succeeded and you've not\nsucceeded. So, let's focus on that. So,\neven better, since 2011, listen this\nnumber. The number of degrees awarded\nhas increased by more than 50% since 11\nin in just 15 years. We're also seeing\ngrowth in master's degrees, other\nadvanced credentials that directly\nsupport workforce needs, including\nteachers seeking deep deeper\nspecialization and professionals moving\ninto leadership roles, which was one of\nyour questions earlier. Ladies and\ngentlemen, these are not just\nstatistics. They are nurses, teachers,\nengineers, scientists, big business\nleaders, and and public servants that go\nout among us and create this vibrant\neconomy that we have in the state of\nGeorgia. That's what we're looking for.\nThat's our role. That's our\nresponsibility to USG. So, keeping\ntuition and fees down matters, and we've\nworked hard to do that for many\nstudents. But the real pressure isn't\njust tuition, it's the full cost of\nattendance. As you well know, hope is a\nmerit-based program that has changed\nGeorgia's trajectory and as Governor\nKent mentioned, is a model all across\nthis country. It literally I was sitting\nin your seat when we did that. It\nliterally changed the whole culture of\nUSG going forward in that way and we\ncontinue to attract the best and the\nbrightest not only here at home but from\nacross the country and to want to come\nto metriculate at our USG institutions.\nSo the reality is frankly that you well\nknow many of our students have a\nfinancial need in order to attend\ncollege. For students who demonstrated\nfinancial need, the gap also includes\nhousing, meals, transportation, books,\nand unexpected expenses. I'm grateful\nand very appreciative to Governor Kemp\nfor his recommendation to you all to\ninvest 325 million in the US Dream SC\nUSG dream scholarship program with the\nexpectation that USG and our\ninstitutions will privately raise\nmatching funds. This is a one-time\nendowment that I've committed to the\ngovernor that we're going to go back and\ntry to match it one, two, three times\nhere with philanthropic funding across\nthe country with national foundations\nthat can provide an ongoing endowment\nfor need-based scholarships in Georgia.\nI believe it is a historic investment in\nGeorgia students by funding funding the\nfirst state needed scholarship of its\nkind. You all probably remember some of\nus have had to apologize that Georgia is\nonly one of two states in the nation\nthat don't do not have a needs-based\nscholarship. This will take us off that\nlist and demonstrate that we're serious\nabout providing higher education for all\nof our students regardless of their\nability to pay or not. But I want to say\nclearly, I want you to hear me clearly.\nThis is not a handout. It is a hand up.\nStudents will have the parameters that\nare expected to earn this by their\nservice, by their workforce, by doing\nwhat they can to provide for themselves,\nnot just having a gift to come in and\napply and get money. This is uh\nthis is important. And I want you all to\nhear that we we are making those\nparameters very clear and communicating\nthat to all of our campuses that way,\nwhich that may include public service or\ninternships here and other places in\nthat way where they're earning and\nworking on campus and other places to\nmake their way as well. The data,\nhowever, is clear.\nDid you realize that students who avoid\nstopping out because of financial\nsetbacks are three and a half times more\nlikely to graduate? Once a student stops\nout, and sometimes it's just a few\nhundred dollars, 300, 400, $500, Georgia\nState has shown through their Panther\ngrant. Sometimes money as less as $1,000\nmeans a difference between them getting\na diploma or stopping out, going out of\nschool with some credit hours, a lot of\ndebt, and no diploma. That's what we're\ntrying to stop here with this dream\nscholarship.\ninvestment gives us the momentum to\nbring private donors alongside the state\ncommittee commitment and open doors for\nmore Georgians. As I visited with\nphilanthropic groups, very substantial,\nwealthy philanthropic education groups\nacross the country, do you know what\nthey asked me? What's Georgia doing\ntoday? You've got the opportunity this\nyear to do something to demonstrate to\nthem that we're putting our money, the\ntaxpayers money, where our mouth is\nabout all students in that regard. And I\nhope you'll consider this very seriously\nin that regard. I'll be happy to answer\nany questions about that. We've already\nnoted and seen small instances of where\nneed-based support can move the needle.\nThe Georgia College completion grant\nlaunched just two years ago thanks to\nthe work of chairman Chuck Martin. I\ntold him he shouldn't leave a while ago.\nI was going to call him out, but uh\nokay, he got back in. Thank you, Chuck,\nfor that. That helps students bridge the\nfinancial gaps that might otherwise\nprevent them from graduating. And we\nwant to just continue to do more of that\nwith this dream scholarship. Enrollment\nand affordability mean little if\nstudents do not progress and complete\ntheir studies. We're on it, folks. I'm\ntelling you, the presidents are tired of\nhearing me. What's your retention rate?\nWhat's your graduation rate? What's your\nfour-year graduation? What's your under\nfour-year graduation? What is your\nfiveyear graduation? I don't want to\nhear about your six-year graduation\nrate, but we're on it and try doing\nthat. We're using data to identify\nstudents who need help earlier, connect\nthem with advising and tutoring, and\nremove barriers that delay graduation.\nWe're also simplifying the transfer\nprocess so students don't lose time or\ncredits when they move from one\ninstitution to another, including our\nour friends and cousins in the TCSG.\nBetter transfer pathways are good for\nstudents and good for efficiency and\nbetter graduation rates earlier. In\naddition, as the governor mentioned at\nuh eggs and issues, we're partnering\nwith his office and sister agencies to\naddress career navigation, getting\nstudents in the right place at the first\ntime, enabling students to connect with\nacademics that apply to their career\naspirations earlier. It's something I've\nbeen advocating since I became\nchancellor, knowing that our high school\ncareer counselors are there dealing with\nmany other issues rather than college or\ncareers going forward. So this will also\nenable that. So uh it will provide\nstudents with personalized guidance to\nhelp them match academic pursuits with\ncareer goals. We're also aligning\nacademic programs with workforce needs\nthrough a more agile program review\nprocess that includes clear evidence of\njob demand and expected outcomes. One of\nthe state's most urgent workforce needs,\nas you well know, is health care. Across\nUSG, we're expanding capacity in nursing\nand other high demand health care\nprofessions while maintaining quality\nand clinical readiness. That means more\ncapacity where we can responsibly grow\nit as well as stronger clinical\npartnerships and simulation experiences\nthat prepare students for modern\npractice on day one. It also means\nstrengthening faculty pipelines and\nclinical placement capacity because\nquality depends on instruction and\nsupervised practice. Georgia has only\ncurrently only one medical school today\nyou know at Augusta University and uh we\nare grateful for the valuable work that\nmedical college has been doing for\nalmost 200 years even as we recognize\nthe challenge that creates that that\ncreates for physician supply. So, thanks\nto you all, Governor Kemp's support,\nwe're moving forward with the University\nof Georgia School of Medicine, which is\nbuilding a new medical education\nresearch facility scheduled for\ncompletion in just December of this\nyear. That's moving fast, folks. As we\nexpand medical education, we must also\nexpand residency opportunities so\ndoctors can train and stay here in\nGeorgia. Georgia, as you know, retains\nphysicians at higher rates when they\ncomplete their residency here. So our\nfocus is on a full pipeline medical\neducation, graduate medical education\nand the clinical partnerships that keep\ntalent in state.\nObviously\nMDs are not the only medical\nprofessions. Dental health is also\nimportant and that's why that oral\nhealth is where Georgia must grow its\nworkforce especially in rural\ncommunities. You know those some of\nthose stats sad statistics about healthc\ncare availability in some of our rural\ncounties. That's why Augustus\nUniversity's d uh dental college of\nGeorgia uh Georgia the university system\nand Georgia Southern and St. Joe's\nCounselor are collaborating on a new\ndental education facility on Georgia\nSouthern's Armstrong campus in Savannah.\nThanks to the state, your investment of\n$178 million in this project, we'll soon\nsee more clinical care rooms, labs,\nclassroom, and facility space, faculty\nspace, all designed to expand training\ncapacity, and helping Georgia address\nGeorgia's dental shortage. We're\ntargeting the first class of 50 students\nin the fall of 28, building the\npartnership that's already established\nthe Medical College of Georgia's\npresence on Armstrong campus. So let me\nshare some encouraging news from one of\nour key health partnerships. This should\nexcite all of us. This is really again I\nappreciate and thank you all for\ntrusting us just about three years ago\nas we moveg into partnership with\nWellStar. In late December, WellStar\nannounced a transformative $50 million\nphilanthropic gift from Tom Gulasana to\nthe Wellstar Children's Hospital of\nGeorgia which is affiliated with Augusta\nUniversity's Medical College of Georgia.\nThis is one of the commitments we\nnegotiated when we talked about this\npartnership is that the children's\nhospital would remain vibrant and\nstrong. This is just adding fuel to that\ncommitment. This is the largest gift in\nboth WellStar and the children's\nhospital history. In recognition of that\ngift, the hospital will be renamed the\nWellstar Golden Stana Golden Sana CH\nChildren's Hospital of Georgia. It'll jo\nit'll join the Golens Alliance, a\nnational consortium of 12 leading\nchildren's hospitals. It will be the\nonly consortium's only member hospital\nin Georgia. The first step will be a new\nstate-of-the-art ped pediatric cardiac\nintensive care unit. From there, this\ninvestment will expand innovation,\nimprove access, and deliver world care\nclass care for children and families\nacross Georgia. Just like for the state\nstrategic reserves or our rainy day\nfund, and you'll hear more about that\nthis year, they save Georgia taxpayers\nmoney by using dollars that we've\nalready earned, typically from indirect\ncost recovery from federal grants. We\nroll over a limited amount of funds from\nyear to year to cover one-time needs\nwithout borrowing or relying on new\nappropriations. And make every October\nwe give you an extended uh paper\nregarding each institution where they\nare, what they've spent the money for,\nwhat their intentions are in order to\nmake sure you all are informed about\nthis these monies. We track these\nbalances annually and again to you all\ndefine how they're going to be used and\nwhat they're for. In that regard\nincludes funds for equipment, technology\nreplacement, startup costs for new\nprograms and facility needs.\nI need to admit I've got a little bit of\nhistory here. When I became governor, I\nwanted to improve government and uh we\ncreated the commission for New Georgia.\nOne of the recommendations is why don't\nwe force departments in some places to\nspend all their money? I think that\ncreated a use it or lose it. You ever\nheard about that budgeting premise? Use\nit or lose it because they won't give us\nmoney next year. This is the whole\nthought, folks. 50,000 students, even\nless, create a small city out here. And\nthat though, you can't just cut that off\nat the end of the year. I want you to be\ncomfortable in how these funds are being\nused. They're limited. Uh 3% of tuition\nand then other things that contribute.\nAnd we want you to be part of that and\nhelping that. But this is saving\ntaxpayers money. And it's critical in\nthat regard using sound business\nprinciples where we make our operations\nmore efficient and effective. One of the\nrecommendations that came out of that\ncommission was to allow both USG and\nTCSG the ability to carry forward\nunspent funds at the university system\nand TCSG. Why?\nStrategic reserves are planning tool.\nThey're not money taxpayers are on the\nhook for. It avoids that use it or lose\nit mentality of spending and helps us to\nbe better stewards, which I think when\nyou look over those reports, that's\nexactly what you will see. Doing that\nprotects our investment and enables us\nto remain one of the most affordable\nuniversity systems in the nation. The\nlegislation providing that authority\nthat you all have granted us to\nstrategically reserve unspent funds from\ncertain funds sources was first passed\nin 2003.\nIt was renewed in 2006, 2009, 2012,\n2015,\n2018, 2021.\nLadies and gentlemen, we need your help.\nAgain, it expires this July, and I\nsincerely appreciate the fact that you\nwant to be mindful of that and\nresponsible for that, and we will commit\nthat. But we need that strategic reserve\nrenewed this year. Also critical to\nlong-term planning is our use of our\nphysical spaces and classrooms. This\nties into efficiency and student\nsuccess. That brings me to a basic\nstewardship question. How do we make the\nbest use of what we already have? That's\na foundational financial question. How\ndo we take what we've got? It's a great\nuniversity system and every president\nwants more and more more. But what I ask\nthe question, what are you doing with\nwhat you have now? That's the question I\nknow that you all are asking of us as\nwell. If we expand access and make\nsmarter use of our schedules,\nwe are strongly encouraging campus to\nsupport a imagine this strange\nphenomenon, a full week of classes, five\ndays. That's horrible, isn't it? We're\nsuggesting that Friday works as well on\ncampuses and and people love to come to\nclass on Friday so we can serve more\nstudents without expanding square\nfootage.\nRenovation isn't just cheaper, it's\nsmarter as well. Across the system,\nwe're repurposing underused buildings to\nmeet modern needs. that helps us to\npreserve historic assets, reduce\ndeferred maintenance, and improve\nstudent access impact while still being\ncareful about what already makes sense\nto renovate and what doesn't make sense.\nWe're also looking at things where it\ndoesn't make sense in a strong\ndemolition aspect. Get it out of the\nway. Stop the square footage charge that\nyou all are paying for when we're not\nusing a building. We're doing that as\nwell. Institutions manage their own\nspace dayto-day, but at the USG office,\nwe conduct system level reviews to make\nsure projects align with the strategic\ngoals. We share best practices so\ncampuses can learn from one another. The\npoint simple, our facility strategy is\nbuilt on stewardship and efficiency and\nutilization.\nHere's what else we've learned. I think\nto mention we we're demolishing wisely,\nmaintaining strategic business and\nbuilding with a purpose. Spatialization,\ncost control, and enrollment trends all\ninform our capital decisions. Databased\nfacts based database decision making.\nWhen we prioritize prior renovation,\nadaptive reuse, we preserve value, award\na necessary new construction, and\nprepare our campuses for the future.\nEvery dollar spent is a step toward a\nstronger academic environment and a\nbetter experience for the students that\nwe serve. Mr. Chairman,\nI submit to you that the University\nSystem of Georgia is delivering for the\npeople of this state. We're growing\nenrollment in a in a national\nenvironment. We're awarding more degrees\nthan ever before. We're keeping college\naffordable and providing transparent\ninformation about cost and value. And\nwe're strengthening Georgia's health\ncare pipeline through nursing growth,\nthe University of Georgia School of\nMedicine, dental education expansion,\nand major clinical partnerships. I want\nto thank you all, the members of this\ncommittee, the general assembly, and the\ngovernor for all of your support in\nallocating the investment of taxpayer\ndollars to the university system. And I\nwant to thank you for your questions and\nyour partnership. And uh since this is a\nbudget here, and I probably ought to\nturn to some numbers now, if you don't\nmind, I'll turn to specifics of the\ngovernor's recommendation for the\namended and next year physical budgets\nand capital budget recommendations.\nWe look forward to working with each of\nyou this session. Appreciate your\ncontinued support of higher education\nuniversity system of Georgia. One of the\nmajor items that you may notice was a\n$325 million in needs-based funding aid\nthat I previously mentioned. I want to\nfocus on now on the cash funded capital.\nThat again is an environment endowment.\nIt's a one-time type of commitment, not\nsomething you'll be expected to to fund\nnext year. That's on our shoulders and I\ncommit to do that. One of the major\nitems is that you'll see in the cash\nfunded additions in the amended Georgia\nTech the 88.2 million for a new\naerospace engineering building. One of\nour major industries in Georgia. If you\ngo to that building, you'd vote for that\nin a heartbeat. If you looked at what's\ngoing over there, UG is 5.6 million for\nnursing school design at the University\nof Georgia, 11.4 million for medical\nschool equipment. And I appreciate we\nhave wisely used the additional MR money\nin helping deferred maintenance over the\nlast couple years. We appreciate that.\nThe governor's recommended it again and\nwill continue to do and relieve us of uh\nin older campuses of buildings that need\nhelp. Again, our total operating budget\ngrows to 3.87 billion, 7.5% higher than\nFY26 due to enrollment growth. So to\ntotally increase roughly $27 million $70\nmillion\n216.5 million as for formula enrollment\ngrowth university system of medical\nschool in Georgia also has that you know\nhealthc care insurance and retirement\nadjustments over 36 million 4 million\nfor retirement rate increases\nother notables are 2.8 8 million to\nestablish the Institute of Civic Thought\nLeadership at Georgia Tech. And you\nknow, many other states have done that.\nWe think it's time that Georgia again\nstarted something where we can help\nstudents to understand civil debate and\ncreate a culture of western civilization\ntaught here in the state of Georgia.\nNow, on to some of our capital requests.\nThe slide, this slide shows the\ngovernor's capital recommendations for\nFY26, which include $118 million.1\nin support of capital projects. For\ntime's sake, I'm not going to go through\nall the list, but I'm happy to talk with\nyou about any of these as we go forward.\nThis concludes the overview and\noperating and capital budget\nrecommendations, Mr. Chairman. So, thank\nyou again to you all, Governor Kemp and\nthe General Assembly for your continued\nsupport of higher education university\nsystem of Georgia. I hope that you\nbelieve as I do that you're getting a\ngood return on the taxpayers's\ninvestment in higher education and\ntalent flow. I look forward to any your\nquestion, Mr. Chairman.\n>> Thank you, Chancellor. We got three or\nfour. Uh Leader Hugley.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Uh Mr.\nChancellor, I'm on on the other side of\nthe room over here. Um, I want to uh\ncongratulate you all on this dream\nscholarship, but I do have a question in\nterms of how did you come up with a\n$3,000 amount and is there a maximum\nover the course of a student's career\nthat they can receive under this\nscholarship?\n>> That's the $350 to $3,000 is a per\nannual type of thing. And the that would\nbe no more than that per year.\nYes, but you talked about four years,\nfive years, four years.\n>> So, it's just for four years.\n>> Uh the other the other thing um\nis I'm glad that you mentioned the uh\nthat we need to get out of the use it or\nlose it mentality and allow our\ninstitutions to use strategic carryover\nfor planning. And I hope that we will uh\ndo that. that that's something that our\nlocal university and technical schools\nare very concerned about that. So, thank\nyou for championing that.\n>> Thank you, ma'am.\n>> Chairman Burns.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chair, and uh thank you,\nChancellor. I appreciate your leadership\nhiding in the corner. U I especially\nappreciate your focus on degree\ncompletion and uh your measurements of\nless than four years, four years, and\ngreater than four year graduation rates.\nDo you have a baseline that we can begin\nto measure the progress in that area? Do\nyou have a baseline for under three,\nexcuse me, under four, four, and more\nthan four?\n>> I think Senator, the best thing to do is\nlet me provide you every institution's\nuh uh numbers on those. There's no\nbaseline. For instance, I' we've asked\nthem all to report what it is. So I\nthink the best way we can do to provide\nit to you and others who are interested\nover what there's under four, the four,\nthe five, and the six is for graduation\ncompletion. But that's the goal. And I\nappreciate you being a stalward in and\npressing that issue of of harvesting\ninvestment that we're making in dual\nenrollment in that regard. And uh we\nwant to we want to we're delighted to\nshow you those numbers.\n>> Thank you,\n>> Chairman Newton.\n>> Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chancellor, thank you\nfor your stewardship over the system and\nuh for so many years of service. Um you\ndid mention,\n>> can you speak up, Chairman Newton?\n>> You did mention a few things about um\naffordability, which I think was was\nhelpful in particular the the the\ndecrease after adjusting for inflation\nand tuition at least tuition and fees\nthat have gone down. Can you tell us any\nmore about that? You mentioned how the\npresidents are encouraged to look at\nfour-year graduation because the number\nof years you're you're paying that\ntuition obviously matters if it's five\nor six instead of four. Uh what are some\nideas that you're doing? Is there a\nparticular goal? Does it vary for all\nthe different schools? I know we have 25\ndifferent ones. Sure. But can you tell\nus any details on how that encouragement\nis going?\n>> A great question. Honestly, one of the\nthings we're really looking at is there\nsome magic about 120 credit hours and\nand is that what qualifies as a\nbachelor's degree? So, we're we're\nseriously investigating that. We're also\nfocusing on shorter term credentials,\num, badges, certificates, and things\nlike that where people can come and, uh,\nmaybe already in the workforce getting\nupskilling, uh, efforts that way. But,\nuh, obviously the completion is what\nreally what we're on. And, uh, as I I\ntell the president what I told you, I'm\nnot really interested in your six-year\ngraduation rate. I'm interested in your\nfouryear and under four-year graduation\nrate.\n>> Thank you, sir.\nChairman Watson,\nhold on.\n>> Thank you, Chancellor. Certainly is\ngreat to see the tuition decrease over\nthe years. I I just wanted a\nclarification on the the line item you\nhad said showed a I think it looks like\nit was a reduction of 4.6 million of AU\nMCG uh campus. Uh can you just help me\nunderstand that a little bit?\n>> Yeah, that was the money that was put\nahead before they earned with the\nexpectation that money now will be\nearned in that regard. So that's why\nit's taken about out of the base there\nat the four million mark that you\nmentioned there because you would put\nthat in for the last two years and help\nbefore the earning of the credit hours\ncome about.\n>> Representative Glaze.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chancellor. I wanted to\nask on the dream scholarship, is it\nstackable and is the dream scholarship\nwill it be the priority?\nIt is uh PEL will continue and any other\ncontribution they made it is it is on\ntop of that it's a gapbased funding that\nway that will help them not stop out\nbecause of finances.\n>> Thank you for\nrepresentative Evans.\nIs that you?\n>> Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you,\nChancellor, Secretary, Governor. Good to\nsee you. Um, on the needs-based\nscholarship, you mentioned, and I think\nthe the budget says match, I think the\ngovernor said this morning, a billion\ndollars in private funds. And I was\nwondering, is that something that the\nregents are raising? Is that something\nthe member institutions are raising? And\nhow far along are we and who do we have\nto thank for those private funds?\n>> Well, we're just beginning since the\ngovernor's announcement. Obviously, I\nwas not able to talk about a match prior\nto that time, but u that's on me and\nthat's on our development. That's on our\nUSG foundation, that's on our regents,\nand that's on the philanthropic\ncommunity of Georgia, but nationally as\nwell as I've gone to national\nphilanthropic educational foundations.\nThe question I mentioned to you earlier\nwas what I get. What is the state doing?\nNow, I can take this $300 million and\nsay, here's a state speaking up. Now, we\nneed you to come alongside. My goal is\nto probably\nmy personal goal is about five times I'd\nlove to have a million billion and a\nhalf in there as an endowment that would\nthrow off cash for the foreseeable\nfuture need-based scholarship.\n>> And one followup, there's currently\nabout 2.5 billion in unrestricted\nlottery reserves. Has there been any\ndiscussion of pulling any funding from\nthat? Um last year we allocated an\nadditional 163 million I believe. Um but\nwe also put back 105 million. So we're\nwe're really not spending down that\nextra reserve. And I was wondering if\nthat had been thought of as a source.\n>> Uh it had been considered obviously uh\nwe need to be very jealous of the hope\nscholarship that continues. Those lines\ncan cross very quickly. the government's\nconcerned about that and I I been to his\njudgment and the OPB's judgment about\nthat in that way. I'm very uh I'm very\nhigh on Gretchen Corbin and the\ncontinued advancement of the of the\nGeorgia Lottery and uh obviously that\nwould be for your discussion. I'd like\nto raise this money privately with the\nstate's step up of $300 million. I'd\nlove to raise the rest of the money f\nprivately across this country for the\nbenefit of our students. I think it's\ngoing to be well received.\n>> Thank you,\n>> Representative Edna Jackson.\n>> My voice is gone. Thank you very much. I\nthink it's a wonderful program. My my\nquestion is will this operate through\nthe financial aid office on each of the\ncampuses and will there be criteria for\nthe me for those students need that that\nyou get a need based uh grant will it be\ndetermined by the staff and how is the\ncriteria going to be set up set up would\nit be the same for every institution or\nevery institution determine the need to\nbase students through their financial\naid office or or how else they do it.\n>> If I understand your question, Mr. Ed,\nit will be administered by the state by\nthe in local institutions who are used\nto dealing with financial aid. They're\nthe ones with the FASA that understand\nwhat the needs are and they can uh they\ncan calculate the unmet need that every\nstudent has. We will prorrate and\nallocate based on a formula of capacity\nand uh enrollment out to institutions\nover where that money would go in that\nregard. But they would be responsible\nfor administering that. We don't want to\nspend any money setting up a new\nbureaucracy in the foundation anywhere\nelse. It would take money away from the\nstudents.\n>> Chairman Carpenter,\n>> thank you. Uh Chancellor, thank you for\nthis. Um, I I do want to ask you as far\nas setting up I'm over here. Okay. First\nthing I would say is don't hold the\nUniversity of Georgia at hostage because\nthey have like four and a half year\ngraduation rates because a lot of people\nlike that extra fall uh because of\nfootball. So don't don't penalize them.\nIt's not a slap. Um the question is uh\nas far as setting up those parameters\nfor for this uh needsbased scholarship\nwhich I think is needed um concern that\nthat maybe the legislature wouldn't have\na lot of involvement in setting up those\nparameters. So that's my question is\nwill will we be involved in that\nconversation?\n>> We we would welcome your feedback. uh\nhonestly these uh parameters will be\ntransparent and communicated but we\nthrough the session as we develop this\nit would obviously be um starting you\nknow July one but we would welcome any\nany ideas and feedbacks uh that could\nhelp in that regard going forward\n>> chancellor I think you have completed\nthe board\n>> thank you chairman Hatchet thank you all\n>> thank you\nNext up is Gresian Corbin with the\nGeorgia Lottery Commission.\n>> Oh, I skipped somebody. Greg Doer,\nTechnical College System of Georgia.\n>> Sorry.\nAll right, let's\nbring the rumble down, please.\nCommissioner, I didn't forget about you.\n>> I didn't either.\n>> Must a fauxa.\n>> Commissioner Doer, thank you for being\nhere and the floor is yours.\n>> Am I on? Yep. Thank you, chairman and\ncommittee. And it's an honor to be here.\nUm, do want to share we have a new\nchairman of the TCSG board, Mr. Buzz\nLaw, and he has sent most of you, I\nthink all of you, an email. So if you\nsee a an email from our new board chair,\nhe's very excited to serve and willing\nto listen to you and serve you as well.\nSo very proud to have Buzz serving in\nthat and an honor here to represent our\nagency, our 22 colleges, our great\npresidents and those that work in\nworkforce across the system. Um, as you\nknow and we are very proud, we have a\npretty singular focus on what our\nmission is. Our mission is to have a\nglobally competitive workforce for this\nstate. And our vision is equally as uh\nfocused to make sure that everyone in\nthis state has the opportunity for\neconomic prosperity by obtaining a skill\nwhich gives them a job which changes\ntheir life, their family's life in this\nstate.\nthis this summer when we got together\nwith leadership across the state, all of\nour local boards and our local\nfoundation boards and we talked about\nthe state of the system. I want to tell\nyou that it was a great day and I'll\nshow you a few things in just a minute\nand I want you guys to share in that. Uh\nwe're going to show you some stats that\nwe could not say we had without your\nsupport both here in this capitol but\nalso back home in your communities. And\nso as we celebrate, I hope you\ncelebrate. Um it's plain and simple. The\nmessage that technical education is\nconnected to prosperity is really\nhitting home. And we talked in that\nconference about do we believe? Do we\nbelieve we're meeting that mission? Do\nwe believe we're changing lives? And do\nwe believe that others believe? And I\nthink today uh this next chart will show\nthat your effect on our college system\nand our future is strong.\nWe have had a enormous number of\nmilestones, but I chose just a few\nhopefully to celebrate with you today.\nBut this current fall semester that we\nended, first time this agency has seen\nover a million credit hours in one\nsemester.\n159,280\nwas the actual headcount enrollment, the\nhighest since the Great Recession in\n2013.\n47,496\ngraduates.\nThat's the highest we've ever graduated\nin one year.\n81,400\ncredentials earned. the same year, which\nwas last year, for the 47,000\ngraduates, the highest number of\ncredentials in a single year. And of\nthose graduates, a 92% placement in\nfield, 99% placement overall.\nThis has been a result of your support,\nthe governor's support, and our\ncommunity support. people understand the\npower of technical education and the\ninvestment that has been made in this\nsystem is paying dividends.\nAs we look at a few of those milestones\nthat you guys have had your hands in,\none jumped out and that was the dual\nachievement program and I want to thank\nPresident Pro Tim Jan Jones for helping\nus still perfect that. It's in a pilot\nstate right now and we're still looking\nhow to make it better. But in those five\ncolleges that have a pilot high school,\nover 4,179\nstudents who are going to drop out of\nhigh school transferred into the pilot\nhigh schools and are still enrolled in\neducation with over 727 students\ngraduating with a high school diploma.\nYou guys appropriated 1.4 million in\napprenticeships, the high high demand\napprenticeship program, making\napprenticeships in the Georgia the\nfocus. and we continue to grow and move\nto levels we haven't seen before in\napprenticeships.\nThe governor funded 10.6 million in\ngrant funds during the co time to\nimplement an e-learning platform which\nwe call TCSG connect. That's cross\nregistration and use of our instructors\nacross all 22 colleges making sure\nstudents can get classes no matter where\nthey are across this state.\nWe have implemented a statewide digital\nbadging and microcredential\nprogram. Chancellor mentioned and he has\nbeen a great partner and I'll talk more\nabout that in a minute on articulation\nand so many other things. Then he\nmentioned short-term programs and micro\ncredentiing showing that someone has a\nskill. We implemented a badging solution\nwhere people can apply for jobs and\nthat's easily seen.\nfew years ago you you funded two\nadditional officers for every uh police\ndepartment we had in our colleges. With\nthose 22 officers, we have enhanced\ncampus safety, but we've also become the\nfirst state system to become fully state\naccredited all 22 police departments.\nTop State for Talent executed for the\nfirst a first in its kind nursing\narticulation agreement with USG. I\ncouldn't thank the chancellor more, but\nwe've talked about the 900 plus\narticulations from college to college.\nWe've talked about opening up pathways\nas the chancellor just mentioned, and\nthe chancellor and his team stepped\nforward and said, \"We want all of your\nnurses to have the easiest pathway to\nsuccess on a BSN. Couldn't thank him\nmore and his team more.\" We're currently\nworking on three more of those\narticulations.\nIn addition, we took the standard 28\narticulated classes from system to\nsystem and grown that to over 35. Now,\none last thing on this page, we\ndeveloped the first ever state workforce\ndevelopment board approved high demand\ncareer list. This was legislation that\nyou guys asked for and the governor\nasked for. Empowered the state workforce\nboard to have one common term on what a\nhigh demand career path is. And the\nstate workforce board has implemented\nthat. and we're applying that across all\nitems such as the high demand\napprenticeship program.\nYou guys are trusting us. We're\nexecuting and you saw the results. It's\nmaking a difference.\nLooking at the overall numbers last\nyear, your technical college system as a\nwhole served over 592,000\ncitizens. Across that, if we just start\nat the uh the gold 44,000, that's adult\nlearners. Most of these individuals did\nnot graduate with a high school diploma,\nbut they're coming back and either\ngetting that high school equivalency or\ntoday we can actually issue a high\nschool diploma to someone who gets those\nnine core credits and two technical\ncertificates.\nLast year we served 41,000. So we're\nseeing that uptick. If we go in uh the\nrotation, the green area, 159,280\ntechnical education students, those that\nare working on a credit pathway that\nproduces a credential or a diploma.\nWe went up from 148,000 students last\nyear. The next area is our workforce\narea. We owe our title three money.\nThat's train training or retraining\nthose that are unemployed or\nundermployed as well as serving with\nresume and employment services. Last\nyear we served 133,000 individuals. This\nyear, as you see, 173,000.\nThe next one, the dark blue is our\neconomic development. That's our\ncustomized training. That's a nonredit\npathway, but teaches a skill. mainly our\nemployers come to us and ask to help\nwith their employment and their\nspecialized needs in in your\ncommunities. Last year we did serve\nmore. We served 147,746.\nThis year on the charts 129,000.\nThe caveat on that, we all have caveats\nwhen the numbers go down, right? We\nchanged the counting systems of how we\nactually number um those that we served.\nWe did not have a unified system and\neverything was self-reported. We\nimplemented a unified system that counts\nit daily and I believe that we changed\nup how we count those numbers. This year\nwill be the first test but that number\nwill go up. And the last area is our\nquick start services. Last year we\nserved 65,92\nand this year 85,954.\nSo when you look at those served in your\ncommunities in every area for the most\npart we're touching the lives in\ndifferent ways and at greater numbers.\nI'll spend most of this presentation\nbecause the appropriations state\nappropriations is primarily funding the\nteched that green area. So you'll see a\nlittle bit deeper dive into the green\narea on our technical education.\nIf we just look at the growth across\ntechnical education, because of the\ngovernor's efforts and your efforts,\nthis state rebounded quicker than other\nstates. And so, while other states still\nhad a negative growth in their two-year\ncommunity colleges or technical\ncolleges, in 2022, we were ahead of the\ncurve. We had a 3% growth. We then last\nyear saw a 10.6% growth or year before\nlast year. And last year, we saw a 9.4%\ngrowth. Just a reminder, the\nappropriations acts based on enrollment.\nWe get funded basically a year and a\nhalf to two years behind on our\nenrollment. So when we get to the budget\nin a minute, last year you funded us on\na 10.6% growth in the appropriations act\nlast year. This year our request when we\nget to the formula be based on a 9.4%\ngrowth that you see on this chart. I'll\nalso show you what we're currently doing\nin the current semester in just a\nminute. just to give that in a credit\nhour in a headcount. You guys fund us on\na credit hour. So that's where you saw\nthe 9.4, but our headcount's up also at\n7.1.\nAnd if you dive into strategic\nenrollment, those high demand areas,\nwhile we've had an incredible year\noverall, it continues to grow in the\nareas we want it to in the state of\nGeorgia. 7.4% growth, almost 19% in\nmanufacturing, little bit 2% in cyber.\nThat was huge last year. So, we're happy\nwhere that is. Love to see more,\nobviously. Aviation 17, CNA 17, and\nnursing and ADN is 20%. In a minute,\nI'll show you a reduction in the budget\nrelated to nursing. I'll go ahead and\nhit it now since you're seeing that\nincrease in numbers. We had a decrease\nbased on rewriting the curriculum where\nwe have more students in nursing, but\nour credit hours went down in nursing.\nSo, when I get to that in a minute,\nit'll look a little odd. You'll probably\nthink, well, he just showed me an\nincrease and now he's talking about a\ndecrease. We had an increase in\nstudents, a slight decrease in credit\nhours. We'll talk about that more in\njust a minute.\nBut this current fall, what will you see\nnext year in the appropriations process?\nThis is just a little test. Obvious\ntaste, obviously, we haven't finished\nthe year, but this current fall over\nlast fall was up 7.9% in student\nheadcount. It's up 9.2% 2% in credit\nhours, which is what our funding is\nbased on. And as I've already mentioned\non that first slide, we had a,6,925\ncredit hours. Students are showing up\nand they're taking more and more credit\nhours, meaning they're getting out\nfaster. It's an incredible story and it\nshows well for our workforce of the\nfuture. Diving into those fall numbers a\nlittle little deeper, we talked about\nthe enrollment already, credit hours\nover a million. we already talked about,\nbut I often get asked about dual\nenrollment versus traditional. So, I\nwant to make sure you saw that our\ngrowth is in both areas. Our traditional\nstudent went up from 79,000 to over\n85,000\nfall over fall. Our dual enrollment\nstudent also went up 33,000 to 36,000.\nAnd our high demand areas that we track\nhave gone up from 25 to 27. I believe\nwhat this shows you is is we're getting\nthe word out to everyone across the\nstate of the power of technical\neducation. They're finding us and\nthey're focusing in on the right areas.\nVery excited about the work of our\ncolleges. We have 22 dedicated\npresidents and a staff out there that's\nreally reaching everybody across our\nsystem.\nLooking at our adult learner so far this\ncurrent fall, you notice last year we\nserved around 40,000. We will continue\nto serve and and break that record this\nyear. But current year to date, 20,000\nenrolled IETS, you may go, what is that?\nIET is an integrated educational\ntraining pathway. That's a lot, right?\nWhat's that mean? It means you leave\nwith a credential. Not only are you\ngetting your high school education\neither through a equivalency or a\ndiploma, but you're leaving with a\nwelding certificate, you're leaving with\na diesel mechanic certificate. The\nstudies, I've shared this, but just to\nrepeat it, the studies show that we're\ntrying to change lives. Getting the high\nschool diploma, most people go back to\nthe same job they have. That's where\ntheir comfort is. But if you give them a\nskill, they'll go get a higher paying\njob. And so, not only are we educating\nfolks in getting that high school\nequivalency and diploma, but we're\nempowering them with confidence to go\nget a job that changes their life. Those\nIETs we want to see go up. 357 is not\nwhere I'm happy with. Our goal is to\nhave everybody that graduates out of\nthere with an IET. And so we're pushing\nthat and pushing it. Our high school\ncompletion, a little over 1,400.\nI mentioned dual achieve, the five pilot\nhigh schools that we're still working\non. We'll continue to work with this\nbody on perfecting that and hopefully\ntaking that pilot off at some time. But\njust the numbers in themselves,\nenrollment this year we're over 1,600\nenrolled. College credentials over 900\ndiplomas this year was 400. But just as\na reminder, the three years it's been in\nin uh in in operation, we've had over\n700 high school diplomas graduated.\nThat's folks that were going to drop out\nof high school that continued and got\ntheir high school diploma. I'll add in\nthey also got a credential. Just\nremember that 900's powerful.\nGeorgia match. We could not be prouder\nof the governor's focus on the top state\nfor talent. One of the first initiatives\nin that was Georgia match. One of the\nareas that I keep driving and hoping\nthat we change and we're seeing it\nchange is high school graduates.\nThe state of Georgia has stayed around\n7% for eons, decades. 7% of those\ngraduating come to your technical\ncollege system. We did not see movement\nin that until Georgia Match. When we\nsent Georgia Match out and made folks\nrealize their opportunities before them,\nwe have jumped from 7% to nearly 10%.\nThe national average is around 12 to 15%\ndepending on what year it is. We have a\ngoal to see that go up to 10 to the 15%.\nAnd so we are so happy about Georgia\nMatch is making a difference. We're\nseeing the impact. Folks at a younger\nage are finding their pathway.\nA few other things that are in Top State\nfor Talent, the accelerated career path\nin high school with our superintendent\nthat was here earlier. We continue to uh\nnavigate our young folks toward a skill\nin high school that navigates to your\ntechnical college and then your\nuniversity systems. Our articulation\nagreements I've already mentioned just\nphenomenal with our university system\nbut also our independent colleges. The\ncareer navigator is on its way as you've\nheard. Georgia match we've implemented\nthe high demand apprenticeship program.\nWe've spoke about the high demand career\nlist and our micro credentials. All of\nthese are making a difference for the\nemployers in our state. So what does the\nbudget look like? kind of as the\nchancellor said, we probably ought to\ntalk about those numbers, right? So,\nhere we are. When you look at this, I'd\nask you to look at the uh second column.\nThe second column in our amended budget\nsays onetime salary supplement, and\nthat's that $2,000 onetime supplement\nthat the governor mentioned in his uh in\nhis state of the state. That equates to\n13.9 million for TCSG, and it fully\nfunds our positions. The other singular\nchange in the amended budget is the next\ncolumn where you see other changes. It's\na reduction of one position for\n$225,000.\nThis is a position that was funded in\nthe uh appropriation act to help with uh\nrecruiting and employing folks for the\nHyundai uh operation. It's anou with our\npartners over at Department of Economic\nDevelopment and they just haven't hired\nit yet. So the money is going away here,\nbut they will continue to move forward\nwith hiring that position.\nThe last item in the amended budget is\nwe do have one capital project and that\nis 48 million for MR&R for systemwide\ncritical infrastructure projects. Just\nto let you know, uh this is something\nthat's been greatly needed. So very very\nthankful to the governor. We have over\n13.5 million square feet across our\nsystem. When you look at that, we have a\nhigh need for roof replacement, HVAC\nprojects, uh, parking lots, plumbing,\nfire suppression. All of the items on\nthis are at end of life. Of those, 48%\nof the projects in the 48 million are\nHVAC projects, 25% are roofing, and the\nrest are fire suppression, plumbing, and\nparking lots. We'll be happy to provide\nthat breakdown as we get into the\nbudget.\nLooking at the big budget, it'll be over\nthe next two pages, so I don't have a\ntotal on this one, but the first item is\nthe statewide spreads that you see in\nthe first column by program. Those\nstatewide spreads are just over uh $20\nmillion, $20,9.99.\nMost of that, as you've already heard\nfrom other agencies, is in the healthc\ncare insurance premiums going down. A\nlittle over $21 million of that is\nhealthc care premiums going down. It's\ngoing up in TRS. It's going up in our\npremiums to DOAZ, GTA, Telkom, and our\nGeorgia Works program. So, $21 million\ncut for healthcare. The rest is adback.\nThe offset at the bottom of the line\nwhen we get to the next page will be a\nlittle over 20 million for those\nstatewide spreads. Looking at the\nworkload and other adjustments, you'll\nsee that that cut again, the 225 for the\nposition I've already mentioned. and\nthen we'll flip to the next page and\ntalk about some new items.\nGoing down the workload and other\nadjustments formula, I mentioned to you\n9.4% increase in credit hours in my\npresentation. That formula results in a\n$33.5 million ad to our budget. In\naddition, in our formula, we have a\nsquare footage based on how we do our\noperations. So, our formula is based on\nthe credit hours covers our personnel\ncost. The square footage covers\neverything else. So if you think about\nplumbing, brake fixes, contracts for\ncustodial, landscaping, all of that, we\nhad a 0.92%\nincrease in that square footage. It\nresulted in a 553,000\nad in in that part of our formula.\nThe next part is the one I've already\nmentioned. I'm sorry, it's not the one\nI've already mentioned. I'll get to it\nin a minute. The next one is a decrease\nof 4.7 million for our dual achieve uh\npilot project. That is the five high\nschools I mentioned. When those five\nhigh schools were originally introduced\nto you guys, it had no funding mechanism\nand the governor and the general\nassembly funded this 4.7 million. There\nwas changes to the legislation that\nconnected the folks in that program to\nthe QBE formula.\nSo the money goes away that's state\nfunded and we're supposed to work with\ndepartment of education on how we get\nmoney to continue this program. There's\nbeen issues around that funding formula\nand we hope this session we're working\nwith a legislative fix on that to keep\nthis program going. But this change is\nbased on the legislative change on where\nthe funding comes from and we're still\nworking on that. So I appreciate your\nsupport on this program as we move\nforward.\nAs we look at the next item, I mentioned\nto you we were very blessed and I want\nto thank this body. Um gosh, four years\nago, Mr. Chairman, uh this body started\ngoing down the road of really looking at\nsome high demand areas that needed\nadditional funding for expansion. Those\nhigh demand areas that were identified\nto make a difference was nursing, CDL,\nand aviation.\nAnd so, as we look at those areas, we've\ndone a great job on making sure those\nareas are fully funded. so the colleges\ncan expand and grow them. Last year I\nmentioned the nursing went down, number\nof students went up, but because of some\npill changes and also getting folks to\nthe workforce quicker, the number of\ncredit hours went down. So majority of\nthis decrease is related to nursing. We\ndid have a real decrease in CDL though.\nOur numbers dipped has come back this\ncurrent fall. So we'll be up again this\nyear. But that's why you see this\nreduction in that high demand area of\n748,000.\n>> So it's not really a reduction in the\ndemand. It's just fluctuating.\n>> Yes, sir.\n>> Yes, sir.\n>> Mr. Chairman, that's the uh that's the\nconclusion of the cash part of it. Uh\nbut we do have a very nice budget\nrecommendation from the governor on many\nprojects going to impact your\ncommunities in capital outlay. The first\nseveral are a continuation of last\nyear's funding. So the first one is the\nfinal funding for the furniture and\nfixtures and equipment for the Atlanta\nTech renovation of the Henry Lewis Hank\nAaron Academic Complex. That's 4.4\nmillion. That was uh an additional\n48,000 square feet for advanced\nmanufacturing.\nThe next item, last session, we're\nblessed to get the design monies of 2.1\nmillion for an advanced manufacturing,\nengineering, technology building in the\nbudget. This year, we're asking for the\n26.5 million in construction. As you can\nsee, the governor recommended half of\nthat at 13.2 million. So, we'll\nobviously be working with you guys,\nhoping that we can fully fund that.\nThe next item is Georgia Pedmont\nTechnical College building B, the\nsimulated training hospital where we\npartner with G with Pedmont Hospital.\nThis is the furniture fixtures and\nequipment for that project. It was a 11\nmillion project of which this is the\nfinal funding for the project at 1.5\nmillion.\nWet wet technical college has been our\nkind of premier automotive uh college.\nThey have a partnership with Mercedes,\nFord, Mazda, and a host of others. This\nis an expansion of over 17,000 square\nfeet for that project. The total cost\nwas 8.6 million, of which this is the\nfinal part for the furniture and\nfixtures at 1.4 million. And the final\nproject that was a carry forward from\nlast year's funding was West Georgia\nTechnical College building a renovation.\nThis is electrification and transport\ntransportation center in Troop County.\nThis is a renovation of over 37,000\nsquare feet, a total project cost of\naround $12 million, and the final part\nfor the furniture and fixtures at\n565,000.\nThe next projects will be all new\nprojects as in this budget that we're\nhoping to kick off with your support and\nthank the governor for his support. The\nfirst one is at Chattahuchi Technical\nCollege, a manufacturing and diesel lab\nrenovation.\nThis is a design and construction in\nBarto County of $ 8.8 million. The total\nprojects just over 10.2 million, which\nmeans if this is funded next year, we'd\ncome back to you on the furniture and\nfixtures at 1.4 million. The next item\nis Georgia Northwestern Technical\nCollege, the industrials, technology,\nand renovation phase two. Last year you\nf you well the last couple of years you\nfunded phase one. Phase one ended up\nhaving a total redo of the\ninfrastructure. What was found out is\nthe uh wastewater treatment part of that\nand the HVAC was just dilapidated and\nfalling apart. So with that money, we\nwere able to actually do all of the\nrenovation to the infrastructure and\nfund uh building C, I mean building uh\nD. And in phase two, we'll come back in\nhaving done all of the infrastructure\nand be able to renovate building C and F\nfor $13.3 million in Floyd County.\nThe next project is at Gwynette\nTechnical College, the North Fulton\ncampus, building two. Many years ago, we\nbuilt a building one there and it is\nmaxed out. It primary focus is on\nhealthc care and IT. This will be the\nsecond building that was planned years\nago when the first one was. We have the\nparking lot there and the space is\nsitting and waiting. But this will be\nthe design money for that at 2.2 million\non that Alpharetta campus. The total\ncost of that project will be over 33\nmillion with us coming back next year\nasking for the 26 million for\nconstruction.\nThe next project is a fall lines. Okone\nfall lines is a diesel lab edition. This\nwill do all of it, the design,\nconstruction, and FFN there in\nWashington County for $5 million there\nin Sandersville.\nThe next project is Oichi Technical\nCollege. It's an automotive and EV\nrenovation and expansion there in\nBulock. The total project cost is 15.7\nmillion. It's over 19,000 square feet.\nAnd the design part of that is a million\ndollars that we're asking for this year.\nAnd the last college project is Savannah\nTechnical College and it's an expansion\nto the aviation campus building there in\nChadam. We have a huge uh partnership\ndown there and we need to expand it\nbecause we have maxed out. This will\nallow us to do three times the students\nwith over,200 students being served in\nthat. It's a $19 million total cost\nfacility with over 26,000 additional\nsquare feet. And the design part of that\nis 1.3 million. We're also blessed, and\nthis is the last item in my\npresentation, that the governor\nsupported an additional college and\ncareer academy at $3 million. As you\nknow, each year that this is funded, we\nrun a competition for folks to actually\ncome in with their communities, their\nlocal communities, their local K12\npartners, their technical college\npartners put together a plan on actually\nimplementing this, and this gives them\nthe seed money to make this happen.\nWe've been very successful across this\nstate. That facility remains in in the\nK12 environment, but has obviously a\ngreat partnership with your technical\ncollege on the skill side. And this\nwould be the 57th, I believe, uh, career\ncollege across this state if it's\nfunded. Mr. Chairman, I'd be happy to\nanswer any questions if there are any.\n>> You got a couple. Uh, Chairman Lynn\nSmith.\n>> Thank you. I'm right in front of you.\nAnd this also goes to my colleagues in\non this room today. Several years ago in\nKawa County, we had our largest industry\ntell our school system they could not\nhire anybody who graduated from our high\nschool. That led to indepth study and it\nwas determined that there were silos of\neducation that prevented this learning\nthat was necessary. The silos were your\ntechnical colleges, your K through2 and\nyour university systems. So the birth of\nthis is why I'm bragging here started in\nKawita County.\n>> It did.\n>> But what happened last week is a credit\nto what our three presenters are telling\nus. The US Secretary of Education\nvisited our third district, Congressman\nBrian Jack. She's visiting all of the\nstates, but she came to our area because\nno one else in the United States has\nbeen able to do what the leadership has\ndone for the past 25 years. So, it's\nphenomenal. And I'm shouting out to you,\nbut to all of our other presenters as\nwell. Our general assembly took the\nbullets when we passed the ones where\neverybody was really mad at us. And so,\nit um it's amazing that now we are the\nleader for the country. It's a it's an\nincredible partnership and Mr.\nWhitlock's done an incredible job out\nthere and it was a great meeting.\n>> Chairman Hickman,\n>> hey, my my board went blank.\n>> Chairman,\n>> too. Two two quick things. Um, when will\ny'all release the high demand um\ninformation y'all give by recent\ndistricts? So, we know, you know, you\ntell us what the high demand for Georgia\nis.\n>> Yes, sir.\n>> But we had a bill a couple years ago\nidentify by recent districts. So we\nwe'll get that to you. We have we have\n12 different if I remember right 12\ndifferent high demand regional areas to\nmake sure that the state high demand is\nnot singular. So we'll get that to you.\nYes sir.\n>> And and the second second question you\nmentioned about overall growth. Are are\nall school do all schools have growth or\ndo we have some that's decreasing or\nwhat what's\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Year to year um all schools\nhave had growth since the last three\nyears. Year to year, it's been up and\ndown, but I can tell you last year we\nhad 21 of 22 colleges have increases,\nand the one that did not was slight.\nThis year, they're already showing\ngrowth. Now, we do have a couple\ninvolved that have a little decrease,\nbut not much. But overall, uh, pretty\nmuch it's all 22 colleges have really\nexperienced growth.\n>> Yes, sir.\n>> Chairman Alan Powell.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to\nsay I'm over here I just want to send my\ncompliments to the agency and all the\npersonnel over there. I've long since\nsaid that the best money in postsecary\neducation is our tech schools in\nGeorgia. And given the fact we don't\nhave a football team over there, then\nthat puts it far above a lot of other\nareas. So, thank y'all for what y'all\nare doing.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Appreciate your\nsupport.\n>> Chairman Burns.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Uh thank you,\nCommissioner. I appreciate TCSG. Uh I I\nwant to get your insights on\napprenticeships and how we might\ncontinue to enhance that method of\ntechnical and adult education.\n>> Yeah, I I think that uh you know we've\nbeen very blessed that this this body\nseveral years ago saw fit to incentivize\nuh companies to spend their time and\neffort on apprenticeships and it's\npaying dividends. And what I mean by\nthat is for the first time and unlike\nmany states uh this body put in 1.2 2\nmillion several years ago and then\nincreased it to 1.4 million uh last year\nto help companies who are applying to\nhave apprenticeship support. Um the\nfederal government sends down federal\ndollars to help pay for training of\napprenticeships. But when you do that as\na company, it takes a lot of paperwork.\nIt takes a mentor. It takes a\ndedication. And sometimes you got to\nspur folks on to see the benefit of\nthat. The result has been is that little\nbit of money has extrapolated into more\napprentice. Meaning um as we look at our\npower companies,\nthey went all in on the opportunity and\nnow that they had the opportunity,\nthey're hiring far more apprenticeships\nthan the state actually supported\ninitially. And so as we look going\nforward, there's a few things. Uh we do\nnot have one entity that actually counts\napprenticeships in this state. TCSG, all\n22 colleges are apprenticeship sponsors,\nmeaning that if a local company wants to\ndo a USDO apprenticeship, they have to\nhave a sponsor to support them and help\nthem navigate that process. All of your\ncolleges do that, but so do a lot of\nnonprofits and other things. And so in\nthe state of Georgia, we actually can't\ntell you exactly how many\napprenticeships we have because there's\nnot one entity that actually counts\nthose. And so as we move forward, if we\nwant to actually profess what I think we\nare, I think we're the best, but I\nreally can't put my finger on it to say\nwe're the best. We'll have to figure out\na way to actually support that. But if\nwe can continue supporting our\nindustries uh as far as supporting them\non actually understanding the power of\napprenticeships, I think that goes a\nlong way, Mr. Chairman. And obviously,\nwe've had a few discussions and I owe\nyou a follow-up discussion.\n>> Representative Evans.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you,\nCommissioner. Um, I couldn't help but\nnotice that the needs-based aid is only\nin the USG part of the budget, and I'm a\nlittle concerned because I know that\nstudents that attend our technical\ncolleges are more likely to be lower\nincome. And while the grant is stronger\nthan it's been, there's still a gap in\nthat cost of attendance. And so, I\nwanted to ask you, couldn't your\nstudents use that as well? Well, and has\nthere been any discussion about\nincluding TCSG as a place where students\ncould use those funds?\n>> Yeah, great, great question. Uh, I'm\ngoing to have to follow up with you. We\nhave not had discussions with the\nchancellor or the governor's office on\nthat yet. Um, but obviously um we're\nalways looking at how to help our needs\nbased uh folks. We have a lot of\nopportunities, you already mentioned in\nthe hope grant. Uh we have 18 pathways\nthat are fully funded both tuition and\nuh fees and so there's a lot of\nopportunity in our system already but\nthere are some students that go through\nthe gaps and we'll have to follow up on\nthat and get with you.\n>> Yes ma'am.\n>> Senator James.\n>> Thank you.\nUh, Commissioner Doer, I didn't hear you\nsay anything about um special education\num students.\n>> Yes, ma'am.\n>> Who uh with all of the money? We have uh\nsome some students who are on the\nspectrum who can learn a lot and others.\nI want to know if if uh you have any\nprograms with the monies that we're\ngetting from the lot lottery\n>> and\nmany of the people who actually play the\nlottery and use the lottery\n>> they have children who need the help and\nso they can become self-sufficient. So\num they need space definitely.\n>> Sure. and uh some of the apprenticeships\nlike the film industry and you know they\ndon't want to hire people from New York\nor from California. They want to hire\npeople right here and some of those 400\njobs that that they have to hire out.\n>> They they have apprenticeships for them.\nI was just wondering if we have any any\nplans on the table to help these uh\ncitizens because they're growing up now.\nAnd you know, they even driving cars\nsome.\n>> So anyway,\n>> yeah, I I'll have to follow up with you.\nI can tell you that we we serve and do\nhave programs, but I can't give you\nspecific today, but but be glad to sit\ndown with you and walk through that.\n>> I would like that.\n>> Yes, ma'am.\n>> Representative Liberty County, how we\n>> All right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I\nwas beginning to wonder this beautiful\nblack was invisible today.\n>> You good to close it out.\n>> Good to see you, Mr. Commissioner.\n>> Yes, sir.\n>> Thank you for your presentation. I just\nwanted to bring to light and I know it\nobviously did not make the chopping\nblock or it made the chopping block and\nis not on the list but in Liberty County\nat the technical college Savannah area\ntech campus there we have of course the\nlargest single base as far as money into\nthe economy in Georgia over$5 billion\ndollar.\n>> Yes sir. We I I got a lot of complaints\nfrom military people. The CDL training\ncenter there, it it got to be it can't\nbe the worst because I know I hadn't\nseen the worst, but it's got to be one\nof the worst facilities you have in\nGeorgia. We literally are running\nextension cords from one building to the\nother because of the light fixtures.\nSighting is falling off, the heating is\nterrible. And they have photo pots,\nphoto toilets for the students there.\nAnd the military folk primarily come\nthere to try and get CDL license are\nhighly disciplined.\nWe want to keep them in Liberty County\nover 400 a month exit out. And it's a\nterrible picture to have the best state\nto do business business in America have\nfacilities that look like that.\n>> Yes, sir. I hear you. And obviously,\nit's something we've had on the list and\nwe need to get it back on there. Yes,\nsir.\n>> Yes, sir. We do.\n>> Commissioner, I got one final question.\n>> Yes, sir. Are there any classrooms\nyou're trying to fill right now that you\ncan't get a professor for?\n>> Mr. Chairman, we we struggle with that\nevery day across the whole system.\n>> Can you tell me what those fields would\nbe where you're having trouble getting\nteachers?\n>> Generically, it's all of the high demand\nareas where folks can go make a better\nliving doing the job versus teaching it.\nSo,\n>> can you list some of those for me?\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Welding.\n>> Welding.\n>> Aviation. Okay.\n>> Electrical.\n>> HVAC. It's just about all of the ones.\n>> What about your nurses? Are you\n>> nursing? Yeah,\n>> very much so.\n>> Yes.\n>> Hygiene fall in that. Are you okay with\nthat one?\n>> No. No. Hygiene falls into it. We're\nstruggling down in Vida with that one\njust here recently.\n>> What\nwould have been easier for me to last\nask which ones you're not having a hard\ntime filling?\n>> Well, you know, the reality is is\nyou know, you may see me not answering\nspecifically because it's a fair\nquestion. That's kind of become the\ndaily grind of our colleges of making\nsure we have the instructors. And so\nwhile it's not easy, we just keep on and\nkeep on and keep on. Every now and then,\nuh, we do have a case. A couple of years\nago, we shut down nursing up at Chatt\nbecause we lost all of our instructors\nand it took us about six months to fill\nthem back. Since then, we've been able\nto keep it going.\n>> Do those folks have to have a degree or\ncan they what? And I'm I'm not trying to\ngo into a 20-minut explanation here, but\nif I would think if someone's got 20\nyears doing HVAC,\n>> I'd rather have that guy teaching me\nthan the person.\n>> No. No. It depends on the discipline. Uh\nnursing, yes. HVAC, no.\n>> Uh but yes, if it's if it's a nursing by\nthe state board requirements, it\nrequires a master's level uh instructor\nin those nursing programs. At the HVAC,\nelectrical, all of those. No sir, it\ndoes not. If there are things that we\ncan clarify and make easier for you,\neither through a licensing point or\nthrough a just they've got the on job\ntraining, that's the person you want us\nto be doing. If you guys could make a\nshort list of that, we would be happy to\ntry to knock that off your list this\nyear.\n>> Thank you. Appreciate that.\n>> Mr. Commissioner, that's it.\n>> Thank you, sir.\n>> Thank you, sir.\nNow,\nGretch and Corbin\nwith the Georgia Lottery Corporation.\n>> Okay. Right.\n>> Yes.\n>> Okay.\n>> Thank you. Thank you, Justin.\non the run.\nI like how y'all sit so nicely next to\neach other.\n>> All right, let's move on.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Thank you. Thank you,\nChairman Hatchet and Tillery for the\ninvitation to join you all and for all\nmembers of this esteemed committee.\nWell, good afternoon. My name is\nGretchen Corbin. I'm the president and\nCEO of your Georgia Lottery and it is\nalways a pleasure to be with you at the\nbeginning of the legislative session.\nMany thanks to all of you for your\nincredible work on every day and days\nlike today. It's um and for the lottery\nfor the support that you provide all\nthroughout the year. We sincerely\nappreciate you. on behalf of Governor\nKemp, the Georgia Lottery Corporation\nboard of directors, our team, and\nespecially the hope and prek students\nand families who have benefited from the\nGeorgia Lottery in the past 32 years.\nI'm excited to provide an information on\na milestone year with you today. Mr.\nchairman, as you know, the good news is\nthe Georgia Lottery does not receive\nappropriations, so you can kind of take\na breather um for requests and but we\nall obviously our purpose is to generate\nrevenue to send back to you to allocate\nalong with the governor to education for\nhope and prek.\nSo, jumping in a quick a quick snapshot\nupdated of the Georgia Lotteryy's\nrecord. It's been a big year of\nmilestones. With our quarterly transfer\nin October, we have now returned over\n$30 billion dollar to the state of\neducation since our inception. Mr.\nChairman, when I say we, I mean we. That\nwas 30 years. Many of you in this room\nwere there when the lottery started or a\nfew of you were in the room. Um, and\nthen also all of you have been\nsupportive and I want to thank you as\nwell as not just being supportive but\nalso possibly being players. Thank you.\nSo, we have now returned over 30 billion\nto the state um for education. We hit\nthe milestone of our 10th consecutive\nyear of returning over a billion dollars\nto the state with this last fiscal\nyear's return of 1.471 billion to\neducation.\nSince inception, 2.2 million\nfour-year-olds have jumpstarted their\neducation by attending a lottery funded\nprek program. And there have been 2.25\n25 million hope scholarship and grant\nrecipients n since 1993 and growing.\nChris may have um an even more updated\nnumber. In fiscal year 25 we made 75 new\nmillionaires.\nAnd in this fiscal year in 26 just\nrecently we had our largest prize winner\never in Georgia lotteryy's history. So\ncan you imagine this? I have to say\nthank you for the great pleasure and\nhonor of meeting with this winner. A um\na one ticket winner of 983 millions Mega\nMillions jackpot win from Nunan ticket\nsold in Nunan.\nAnd not only was this national I have to\nstep back. This was such a great day and\na great week, wasn't it?\nUm, and I just want to I do want to back\nup and make sure that I share with this\ngroup what the winner said to to me as\nto please share with Georgia. Thanks to\nall of you. He this winner had the\nability to stay anonymous. But the\nGeorgia winner did say, Gretchen, please\nlet everyone in Georgia know how\nthankful our family is. That our family\nhas had hope scholarships or SC hope\nscholars who have benefited from the\nGeorgia Lottery. That we have\ncontinuously played the Georgia Lottery\nto support the Hope students. We saw\nyour advertising on a billboard um when\nwe were driving down the interstate. And\nthere were a couple more pieces that it\nwas just minute by minute by minute that\nmade this win happen for this winner.\nMost importantly, um, this winner said,\n\"We plan on making this a generational\nwin and giving back to Georgia.\" And so\nI look forward to watching this as\nchills just went down my body um because\nI had the opportunity to sit with this\nwinner and hear from them um exactly\nwhat they planned in regards to the\ngenerational um longevity of this prize\nas well as giving back. And I could see\nin their eyes just how how smart and how\nstrong they wanted to um they wanted to\nmake sure that their winnings were. They\nwanted to make sure that they did well\nby these winnings. So, I wanted to make\nsure that I just stopped and shared that\nwith you because you made that win\npossible the largest win possible for\nGeorgia, for a Georgia player. And with\nthat win, because it was a Georgia\nwinner, um we also had $23.5 million go\nback into taxes on just that win. in\naddition to the jackpot roll which on a\nlarge jackpot roll that one specifically\nbought brought in 27.9 million for hope\nand prek.\nSo how do we return over a billion\ndollars every year? You all know it's\nall product selling our lottery product.\nOur job is to develop the strongest\nproduct possible to go to market to make\nall of our players aware of it through\nthe strongest marketing possible and to\nsell the product in the most responsible\nfashion ever and specifically to\ngenerate the most money possible to send\nto you and the governor to allocate for\nhope and prek. We continue to be\ninnovative with our instant product,\nlaunching four to six games every month,\nmaking investments in digital menu\nboards, placing vending in in market to\nassist retailers,\nand as well with our draw products,\nwhich are some of our most popular along\nwith our poss our popular nationwide\ngames. um our our statewide games, Cash\nThree, Cash 4, Fantasy 5, Cash Pop,\nGeorgia 5, all of which have seen\nincreases year-over-year. Our\ninteractive platform, which was launched\nin 2012, continues to grow\nyear-over-year. Our interactive platform\nis made up of internet and mobile\nchannels, and we are currently in the\nmiddle of a year-long interactive\nplatform upgrade, which we are excited\nto share with our players this fiscal\nyear.\nWe have regulatory responsibilities for\nco-am coin coin operated amusement\nmachines which includes the licensing of\nowners and operators for co-ams the\nissuance of permits permits for co-ed\nmachines the collections of license fees\nfor co-ams collections of net receipts\nfrom class B machines and compliance\nCOAM is growing licensing numbers as of\nthe end of Q1 fiscal year 26 were 40,875\nmachines in market at over 7,000\nlocations. For fiscal year 25, $192\nmillion was generated from co-en play\nreturn to education. The industry\ninvests well and they do their best to\ngenerate the most for education. We're\nincredibly appreciative of their work.\nUm, Chairman Powell, I want to thank you\nalso. Beginning July 1st, um, thanks to\nChairman Powell's leadership as well as\nall of your leadership, COAM redemption\nwill now, um, go to just lottery product\nand gift cards. Um, Chairman Powell\nalong with all of you have been very\nadamant about making sure that cash is\nout of the market and we think that that\num, will go far. So, Chairman, thank\nyou. And to your committee's leadership,\nthank you as well.\nUm the proposed budget we do not have a\nask but just wanted to note that um\nlottery is um noted on pages 15 and 37.\nOur year-to- date results as the lottery\nworks towards our return. I wanted to\nshare that we are off to our strongest\nstart in our 32-year history. And a\nquick snapshot of Q1 fiscal year 26. It\nwas the best Q1 with $414.8\nmillion transferred to the lottery for\neducation account. That profit was 51.3\nmillion higher than Q1 fiscal year 25.\nAnd with that, again, as I've mentioned,\nnot only did we top 30 billion, but now\n30.2 billion for education programs in\nGeorgia with this last transfer.\nUm, I enjoy joining y'all for\nCommissioner Doers and Chancellor\nPurdue's presentations.\nAnd I have to tell you that when we go\nto work at the Georgia Lottery every\nday, we go to work with the students own\nmind. Casey Carpenter, we go to work\nwith your son own mind. We go to work\nwith many of the interns that are in\nyour offices own mind. Whether they are\nin a public school, whether they are in\na private school, whether they are at\nH.B.C.U. you receiving hope. We are so\nthoughtful of these students. We think\nabout the families that are taking their\nprek student to school in August for the\nfirst time ever and how important that\nis. We know that everything that we do,\nevery dollar we make, every dollar we\nspend wisely and every dollar we don't\nspend,\nwe do this with students in mind and\nmaking sure that we are providing the\ngreatest amount of revenue back to this\nlegislative body and the governor to\nallocate for education. And so with\nthat, we're having a banner year\nbarreling toward a positive fiscal year\nreturn. And as always, support\nappreciate your support in championing\nus. And I have to say, Chairman\nWilliams, I hear about you talking about\ngames. And so I want to make sure before\nI left that you all know that our\nMegaillions Jack fought for tonight is\n$250 million. We hope that you will go\nto your local retailer and purchase it\nthere. Mr. Chairman, if this hearing\ngoes a little long, they can pull out\ntheir app and and play there as well. We\nso appreciate you, Chairman Hatchet and\nTillery. Thank you for this opportunity\nto present and as always happy to answer\nany questions.\n>> Any qu any questions?\n>> I think everybody's ready to get out of\nhere and go buy buy a ticket.\nThank you, Gretchen.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n>> Thank you.\n>> Thank you.\n>> All right.\nNext up is Chris Green with the Georgia\nStudent Finance Commission.\nMr. Green, welcome to the committee.\nWe'll give these folks a few seconds to\nclear out. We're going to go ahead and\nget going again. So, if you don't mind\ntaking your conversations outside of\n341,\nPresident Green, go ahead.\nGood afternoon. Thank you, Chairman\nTiller, Chairman Hatchet, and members of\nthe Joint Appropriations Committee. Uh,\nmy name is Chris Green. I have the\npleasure of serving as president of the\nGeorgia Student Finance Commission. Uh\nthank you for the opportunity to appear\nthis afternoon to discuss the governor's\namended fiscal year 26 and recommended\nfiscal year 27 budgets for GSFC.\nUh since Governor Kemp appointed me to\nsucceed President Lynn Riley back in\nMarch, we've been working diligently to\nensure GSFC continues to live up to its\nreputation for excellence in expanding\naccess to education for Georgians. Uh we\nare very grateful for the resources that\nyou all provide to us and my goal this\nafternoon is to highlight how that trust\nhas enabled us to expand access to\neducation, support degree completion,\nand make sure Georgia continues to be\nthe top state for talent. Uh thank you\nfor entrusting us with this important\nmission.\nYou know, when I tell people I work for\nthe Georgia Student Finance Commission,\na lot of Georgians may or may not uh\nimmediately recognize our agency name,\nbut when I say, \"Oh, we administer the\nHope Scholarship.\" The reaction is\nalways the same. They say, \"Oh, you\nknow, my my child received Hope\nScholarship or I received Hope\nScholarship.\" And they say, \"Thank you\nso much for what you do and for help\nmaking college more affordable for my\nfamily.\" Uh, I know we have some new\nmembers with us today. And so I wanted\nto briefly highlight how our agency is\nreally made up of three different legal\nentities that help us accomplish our\nmission. Uh the Georgia Student Finance\nCommission is the umbrella state agency\nuh which is the name most often used to\nrefer to all three entities. But the\nGeorgia Student Finance Authority and\nthe Georgia Education Savings Authority\nare separate legal entities, but the\nthree work together uh to help us\naccomplish that mission.\nWe'd like to begin with a few agency\nhighlights that demonstrate the scale\nand responsibility of our work. GSSC\nsupports hundreds of thousands of\nstudents across the state through\nscholarships, grants, outreach, and\nadministrative services. Over the past\nyear, we have continued to modernize our\noperations, improve system performance,\nand strengthen internal controls to\nensure we continue to be good stewards\nof public funds. These operational\nimprovements allow us to focus resources\nwhere they matter most, directly\nsupporting students and families. As you\ncan see here, there continues to be\nstrong growth in the dual enrollment\nprogram, which exceeded 71,000 high\nschool students, taking more than\n736,000\ncredit hours during the last academic\nyear. In October, we launched the third\ncycle of the nation's largest state-run\ndirect admissions program by mailing\nmore than 136,000 letters to high school\nseniors as part of the Georgia Match\ncampaign. I'll speak more about Georgia\nMatch in just a moment. We take our\nmission seriously, utilizing a\ncombination of technology and individual\nface-to-face engagements to disperse\nmore than 635,000\nscholarships and grants last year. Thank\nyou. To do that, we conducted 1,600\noutreach events drawing more than 92,000\nparticipants.\nGafutes.org, our one-stop college\nplanning website, attracted more than 5\nmillion visits and over 230,000\nnew accounts created. We owe that\ntremendous success to more than\nmarketing efforts. We partner closely\nwith high school counselors, teachers,\nand administrators in your districts uh\nto make sure that students h are\nconnected with these financial resources\nthat you provide uh to make sure they\ncan continue their education here in the\nPeach State.\nFinally, our Reach Georgia scholarship,\nwhich combines need-based aid with\nmentoring, academic coaching, and\nadditional community support, exceeded\n5,400 students since this program was\ncreated by Governor Deal. For each of\nthese categories, there are numerous\nstories of lives changed and improved\nbecause of your investment in access to\neducation. We wouldn't have the talent\npipeline available to the businesses in\nand industries here without this\ninvestment. So again, I say thank you\nfor your support of GSFC and these\nprograms.\nLadies and gentlemen, this slide\nreflects the magnitude of your\ninvestment and how we administer those\nfunds to students. In the most recent\nfiscal year, GSSC dispersed more than\n$1.1 billion dollar in program funds to\nGeorgia students. These dollars support\na wide range of programs, including hope\nand zelmiller scholarships, need-based\ngrants, and targeted workforce related\ninitiatives.\nBy far the largest portion, nearly a\nbillion dollars, was distributed through\nhope programs like the Hope Scholarship,\nthe Zel Miller scholarship, Hope Grant,\nHope Career Grant, and others. I know we\nare all proud of the legacy that hope\nhas had on our state which has\npositioned us to become a national\nleader in the amount of aid awarded to\nstudents. This is due in large part to\nthe good work of the Georgia Lottery\nCorporation under the leadership of\nPresident Corbin. Uh and so I just want\nto formally say thank you again to the\nGeorgia Lottery for the historic\npartnership that makes this possible.\nBeyond the hope programs, you can see\nthe commitment to dual enrollment\nfollowed by the tuition equalization\ngrant which goes to students attending\nour independent colleges.\nThe next largest slice goes to other\nprograms such as the inclusive\npost-secary education grant or IPSY\ngrant uh which goes to students with\ndisabilities uh the scholarship for\nengineering education reach and the\npublic service memorial grant among\nothers.\nThe Georgia College completion grant is\nnext and it helps eliminate the gap in\naid and cost of attendance as students\nnear the completion of their degree.\nI'll also say more about that program in\njust a moment. And the focused\ninvestment you all continue to have in\nour military programs includes the\nGeorgia Military College State Service\nScholarship, the Georgia National Guard\nservice cancel loan, uh the Georgia Hero\nScholarship, and multiple programs at\nthe University of North Georgia. Uh the\ntakeaway here is not just volume but\naccountability. Every dollar represents\na commitment to transparency,\ncompliance, and measurable impact.\nI know you all have heard a great deal\ntoday about the Georgia Match program\nand could not agree more that Georgia\nMatch is one of the strongest examples\nof how our agency supports the state's\neducation and workforce agenda. Uh\nthrough this program, eligible high\nschool seniors receive direct admission\noffers from Georgia public colleges and\nuniversities based on that high school\nhope GPA. For the class of 2026, more\nthan 136,000 students received letters\nacross our state. Uh the heat map here\nuh shows where students received a\nletter as represented by the light blue\ndots and where students claimed a spot\nas indicated by the dark blue spots. Uh\nthanks in part to Georgia Match, there\nhave been enrollment increases for USG\nand TCSG. While many states faced\nenrollment declines, USG enrollment has\nincreased for three consecutive years,\nreaching an all-time high of 382,000\nstudents. TCSG also set new records this\nyear with 159,000 students who took more\nthan a million credit hours last\nsemester for the first time.\nThe quality of institutions in Georgia\nand their excellent reputation certainly\ncontributes to our growth, but the\nimpact of the Georgia Match program is\nundeniable. Governor Kim's vision when\nhe convened the leadership of the\nstate's education agencies, and your\nsupport for Georgia Match makes this one\nof the most successful and largest\ndirect admission programs in the\ncountry. Georgia Match reduces barriers,\nsimplifies the transition from high\nschool to post-secary, and sends a clear\nmessage to students. There's a place for\nyou in Georgia's education system.\nFor those of you who have not had a high\nschool senior in your home recently, I\ndid just want to share a quick copy of\nwhat the letter looks like. Of course,\nit shows not only uh which institutions\nthe students automatically meet\nadmissions requirements, but we also\ninclude information about financial aid\nand trying to start that conversation\nearly. And I could just uh you know ask\nyou to imagine for a moment when you\nwere thinking about what to do after\nhigh school, what if you had received a\npersonalized letter from the governor\ntelling you where you automatically are\neligible for admission and just what a\ngame changer this is taking the fear and\nanxiety out of the college application\nprocess.\nAs you've been hearing from the governor\nand other state agencies today, uh the\ntop state for talent initiative unifies\nour approach to education. Through\nGovernor Kemp's leadership, we are now\ncollaborated to an unprecedented degree\nwith the governor's education and\nworkforce strategy team. This is the\ngroup where that collaboration happens.\nIt is made up of the agency leaders from\nthe Department of Education to the\nDepartment of Labor and all of us in\nbetween who helped develop the talent\npipeline, the Technical College System\nof Georgia, the University System of\nGeorgia, the Governor's Office of\nStudent Achievement, and the Georgia\nStudent Finance Commission. Because of\nour role in implementing the Georgia\nMatch program, we have an opportunity to\nrepresent students and families in\nconversations about the best way to plug\nthem into the state's workforce.\nThe governor's workforce summit this\npast October at the World Congress\nCenter drew more than a thousand\nbusiness, education, and government\nleaders in attendance.\nWe had the opportunity to introduce that\nimpressive audience to three students\nwho benefited from GSFC programs. West\nGeorgia Technical College student Reagan\nBearden and Valdasta State University\nstudent Abigail Gilbert shared firsthand\nhow Georgia Match helped them claim\ntheir spot and continue their academic\njourney toward high demand careers in\nhealthcare.\nStudent Jeffrey Lowe studied at both\nGeorgia Pedmont Technical College and\nGeorgia State University as he prepares\nfor a career in the music management\nbusiness. The Hope Grant and the Hope\nScholarship made college possible for\nhim. These students are just three\nexamples of how the Georgia Student\nFinance Commission is participating in\nthe shared effort to make sure Georgia\ncontinues to be the top state for\ntalent. And I could say thank you again\nfor your support of House Bill 192 last\nyear. this was the top state for talent\nact. Uh this new law calls on high\nschool students to create that GA\nfutures account beginning in nth grade.\nUm and so to help facilitate that, we've\ndeveloped a new module in GA futures so\nthat high school counselors can see uh\nthe students progress with doing this as\nwell as offer personalized assistance.\nUh Mr. Mr. Chairman, the career\nnavigator, the last bullet point on the\nscreen. I I know this is not in GSFC's\nbudget, but if I could add my voice and\nask for the committee's favorable\nconsideration of this recommendation in\nthe Office of Student Achievement\nbudget. So much of what we do is trying\nto get the best information to high\nschool students quickly so they can make\nthose plans for after high school\nwhether it's military workforce\npost-secary and the development uh this\ngovernor recommendation for a career\nnavigator stands to be a gamecher for\nour students.\nUh as you all know uh our agency\noperates a team of outreach\nrepresentatives across the state. Uh I\nlike to think of these heroes as our\nrecruitment team to make sure that\ntalent stays in Georgia. Uh these\ndedicated professionals are the main\npoint of contact for us in your high\nschools. Um and so throughout the year\nthey're providing workshops and\nin-person trainings to help students and\nparents begin thinking about college\nplans. Uh as I mentioned last year they\nmet with nearly 92,000 students at over\n1,600 events. And so if you're ever\ninterested in hosting an event in your\narea, uh please call on me and we'd be\nglad to connect you with your outreach\nrepresentative.\nWhen I assumed this position last\nspring, I challenged my team to focus on\nthree topics. How to better serve\nstudents, to be known for exceptional\ncustomer service, and to promote\nfinancial literacy. Uh I know in my\nrelationship with many of you for so\nlong that part of our mission in\nproviding access to education is also\nmaking sure that Georgians are making\nsmart financial decisions. And so I'm\nproud that this year we'll be launching\nan enhanced portion of our website uh\njust in time for financial literacy\nmonth in April. Uh responsible borrowing\ncan provide access to post-secary\neducation and we want families to be\nequipped to navigate that process in a\nway that sets students up for future\nsuccess. Um educating them about the\nbest career choices for their interests,\ntalents, and financial needs goes\nhandinhand with identifying scholarships\nand grants to help them pay for a\nmeaningful credential.\nUh, financial literacy also complements\nour aid programs by helping students\nmake informed decisions about budgeting,\nborrowing, and completion.\nUh, those of you with high school\nseniors or college students know about\nthe FASA. And like most Americans, you\nprobably have some choice words to\ndescribe your experience with this form.\nUh, but the FASA or the free application\nfor federal student aid is the gateway\nto free financial aid. and supporting\nFASA completion is one of the most\ncost-effective strategies we have to\nincrease access to federal financial aid\nfor Georgia students. Uh we're very\npleased that because of GSFC outreach\nand marketing efforts alongside those\nfinancial literacy resources, Georgia\nincreased our FASA completion rate in\nfiscal year 25 and we continue to rank\nabove the national average.\nPictured here is one of our FASA\ncompletion events uh at Collins Hill\nHigh School in Gwynette County. Uh, I\nthink these students are smiling because\nwe're helping them get through that\nFASA. And so, uh, simply put, every\nadditional FASA completed represents\nfederal dollars coming into Georgia at\nno additional cost to the state. And\nthis is a clear example of how targeted\noutreach can leverage significant\nexternal resources.\nMr. Chairman, before I dive into our\nbudget numbers, I want to shift briefly\nand highlight some of our financial aid\nprograms that you all have invested in\nrecently. Uh so with a maximum award of\n$2,500, the Georgia College completion\ngrant targets students who are otherwise\non track to graduate and the goal is\nsimple, to prevent small financial\nobstacles from becoming permanent\ndropouts. Uh this program has been\ntremendously successful in helping\nstudents get across the finish line,\nearn their credential, and join the\nworkforce. During the last legislative\nsession, you all expanded this program\nuh to help students when they have just\nthat relatively small gap between what\nthey owe and what they can pay for their\neducation. Uh that was House Bill 38\nduring the 2025 session.\nSince the program began in 2023, we have\nmade more than 28,000 awards to students\ntotaling more than $32 million. uh grant\nawards are based on program requirements\nand are available uh allocated funds at\nthe institutions. This is at USG, TCSG\nand uh nonprofit independent colleges.\nAnd so thank you again for your support\nof House Bill 38.\nAnother program we are proud to\nadminister is the Reach Georgia\nscholarship. REACH is a statewide\nneed-based aid program launched by\nGovernor Deal in 2012.\nUh, REACH is unique and that is a public\nand private partnership. So, the\ngenerous appropriations that you provide\nmake up $9,000 of each $10,000\nscholarship and then local school\nsystems raise the remaining $1,000 uh to\ncomplete that student scholarship.\nStudents must meet program requirements\nrelated to academic achievement,\nbehavior, and attendance to be eligible\nuh for that college scholarship. And uh\nyou know, one of my favorite things\nabout this program are these signing\nceremonies in the fall. I had the\nopportunity to attend a reach signing\nceremony in Carol County uh along with\nour commissioner, Linda Mcuarter. The\nthese are so much fun because the\nstudents are there with their commitment\npapers and their parents and it feels\njust like a collegiate uh athletic\nsigning ceremony. Just so much positive\nenergy in the room. And so, um, if you'd\nlike to become more involved, um, in\nyour local school system, please get in\ntouch with me and we'd love to connect\nyou with your local REACH coordinator.\nThe newest program we are privileged to\nadminister is the Georgia Promise\nScholarship, an education savings\nprogram enacted by the General Assembly\nduring the 2024 legislative session.\nYou all gave us one year to build this\nnew program and develop the\ninfrastructure so that we be could begin\nawarding funds for the first time this\npast summer. The Georgia Promise\nScholarship is for eligible families\nenrolling in private schools or\nparticipating in a course of home study.\nIn FY26, the scholarship award amount\nwas $6,500.\nIn this first year, we have over 7,700\nstudents participating in this inaugural\ncohort. Of those, three out of four\nstudents come from families below 400%\nof the federal poverty line threshold.\nWe had an outstanding fall semester and\ncontinue to learn from our experience as\nwell as other states who have\nimplemented educational choice programs.\nThanks to your diligent focus while\ncreating this legislation two years ago,\nall of the scholarship funds that are\ndispersed to families must be utilized\nwithin a secure closed marketplace. This\nrobust vetting of schools and vendors\nhelps ensure funds are only spent on\nqualified education expenses.\nThis slide shows how Promise scholarship\nfunds are being used by eligible\nstudents. As you can see, over 70% of\nexpenditures support tuition and fees\nwith the remainder covering other\nqualified educational services. This\nbreakdown demonstrates that funds are\nbeing used as intended within statutory\nguidelines.\nLadies and gentlemen, I know today's\npresentation is supposed to be about the\nnumbers, but we mentioned earlier how\nevery Georgian has a hope story and\nwe're starting to collect promise\nstories, and I felt like I would be\nremiss if I didn't share some of the\nfeedback we have received on this new\nprogram. The message on this slide comes\nto me from a mother of a Georgia student\nwith special needs. Since launching this\nnew program, the families who have\nreceived promise have underscored for me\nand my staff at GSFC that two things can\nindeed be true at the same time. Georgia\nis blessed with outstanding public\nschools and there are times when\nfamilies have extenduating circumstances\nand need another choice. The Georgia\nPromise Scholarship gives them that\nopportunity and we're grateful for your\nsupport of this program.\nTurning now to the budget. The\ngovernor's amended fiscal year 26\nrecommendation supports the continued\nadministration and oversight of these\nprograms. You can find GSFCs in section\n44 of your track sheets. The first item\nis 44.2.1\nin commission administration. This\nchange of 245,000 is the governor's\nrecommendation for the one-time $2,000\nsupplement for our employees. The next\nitem is 44.3.1\nin dual enrollment. This change reflects\nthe governor's recommendation of an\nadditional 18.5 million to meet the\nprojected need.\nNext is 44.4.1\nwhich is a reduction of 160,000 in the\nengineer scholarship. This item reflects\na one-time trueup request from Mercer\nUniversity based on the actual number of\nawards made in FY26.\nNext is 44.5.1\nin Georgia Military College Scholarship.\nUh to meet the projected need, the\ngovernor is recommending an additional\n440,000 to serve those students.\nThe next item is 44.9.1 in Hope\nScholarships private schools. This\nrecommendation is to increase funds by\n927,000 to meet the projected need to\naccommodate the projected growth and\nawards.\nIf you'll turn to the next page in your\ntrack sheet, we'll discuss item 44.10.1\nin Hope Scholarship Public Schools. The\ngovernor is recommending an increase of\n11.3 million to meet the projected need.\nOur next item is 44.12.1\nin North Georgia Military Scholarship\nGrants. Like uh the increases at Georgia\nMilitary College, uh to meet the\nprojected need, the governor is\nrecommending an additional 555,000\nNext is 44.14.1\nin promise scholarship. The governor is\nrecommending a one-time reduction of 86\nmillion. Again, this is a one-time\nreduction that represents a program\ntrueup based on the actual number of\nparticipating students we saw in the\nfirst year. The final item for GSFC is\n44.18.1\nin tuition equalization grants. Uh this\nitem is a yes caption directing the\nagency to utilize program reserves to\nmeet the projected need.\nUh lastly, committee members, I'll\nmention 44.19.1\nfor INPEC. Uh the Georgia nonpublic\npostsecary education commission is\nadministratively attached to GSFC. Uh\ntheir executive director, Dr. Cook Kirk\nShook, is here and we'll be happy to\nanswer any questions you have. but uh\ntheir item reflects the governor's\nrecommendation for the $2,000 onetime\nsupplement.\nAnd so now we turn our focus to the\ngovernor's budget recommendations for\nfiscal year 2027. Once again, you can\nfind us in section 44. Uh the first item\nis 44.1\nin college completion grants. Uh\ngovernor is recommending an additional 1\nmillion for TCSG students specifically.\nUh this increase is related again to\nthat House Bill 38 that you all\nsupported during the last session uh\nincreasing eligibility for TCSG\nstudents.\nThe next items are in commission\nadministration 44.2.1\nthrough 44.2.4.\nUh these items are the same statewide\nchanges my colleagues have mentioned\nbefore me, so I won't spend too much\ntime here. Uh the total change\nrecommended by the governor is a\nreduction of 475,000.\nThe next item is 44.3.1\nin dual enrollment. Uh like the amended\nbudget, the governor here is\nrecommending an additional 27.6 million\nto meet the projected need.\nNext is 44.5.1\nin the foster care scholarship. Uh and\nif I could say thank you so much to all\nof you who have been working on this\nissue tirelessly uh for so many years.\nUh very proud to partner with you all to\nimplement this new program. Uh the\ngovernor is recommending an initial\ninitial funding level of $2.5 million\nfor FY2027.\nNext is 44.6.1\nin Georgia Military College scholarship.\nUh to continue fully funding this\nprogram, the governor is recommending an\nadditional 756,000.\nNext on 44.10.1 10.1 in hope\nscholarships uh private schools. The\ngovernor's recommendation for FY27\nuh fully incorporates uh the hope award\nequalization item that you all have been\nworking on and the total recommended for\nthese changes is 3.2 million.\nThe ne next item is 44.11.1\nand hope scholarships public schools.\nThe governor is recommending an\nadditional 55 million for hope public\nand FY27 to meet the projected need.\nNext is 44.13.1\nin North Georgia Military Scholarship.\nTo continue fully funding the program,\nthe governor is recommending an\nadditional 672,000.\nAnd if you turn the page one last time,\nyou'll see 44.19.1\nin tuition equalization grant. Um to\naccommodate the continued growth in this\nprogram, the governor is recommending an\nadditional four million in state funds.\nAnd then the final item is our attached\nagency INPEC. Items 44.20.1\nand 44.20.2\nreflect the relevant statewide changes\nfor a reduction totaling 53,000.\nUh colleagues, thank you for the\nopportunity to present the governor's\nbudget recommendations for the Georgia\nStudent Finance Commission today. Um,\nand thank you for your support of these\nprograms and of Georgia students. Be\nhappy to answer any questions.\n>> Senator Burns, is that did you not have\na question? Wave. Uh, Senator Oric.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chair.\nappreciate your presentation today and\nyour uh leadership as you're getting uh\nuh deeper and deeper into your uh fairly\nnew uh tenure uh as this commissioner.\nUh I would the the uh match grants. Do\nyou have the numbers? You know, we that\nthis is a relatively new program that's\nbeen very received very well and and\nvery successful. And are are we able to\nget some numbers now on that? uh slice\nof students that never respond after\nthey get the letter. That may be where\nwe're going to be finding the the folks\nthat will now benefit from this uh new\nuh needs-based uh uh funding that uh is\nrecommended in the governor's budget.\n>> Uh Senator, thank you for the question.\nOne of the graphics I wish I had to\nshare with you all uh the office of\nstudent achievement puts out a pie chart\nshowing what happens to our students\nafter high school graduation. And uh you\nknow we can see the percentage that\nstays in state, we can see the\npercentage that goes out of state, we\ncan see the percentage that enters the\nworkforce, but there is a significant\nportion of that pie chart where we have\nno idea what happens to our students\nafter high school graduation. We\nabsolutely think that Georgia match will\ncontinue to be a gamecher. And so the\nnext time we uh see my colleagues from\nthe office of student achievement, I'll\nask them about the latest pie chart to\nsee if we have moved the needle on those\nstudents who didn't think college was\npossible for them. And I hope what\nyou've heard from Commissioner Doer and\nChancellor Purdue, uh, you know, both of\ntheir enrollments are up. And so, uh,\njust really proud of the impact that\nGeorgia Match continues to make. Yes,\nma'am.\nWell, thank you for testifying to the\ncommittee when we were looking at the\nneeds-based uh options that are are now\nappearing in our budget. Thank you so\nmuch. Yes, ma'am.\n>> Leader Hughley.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you so\nmuch for your presentation. Uh can you\ngive us a number of completion grants\nthat you had this past year?\n>> Yes, ma'am. And while I'm looking for my\ndata point, I'll tell you um the agency\nproduces three annual reports. Uh one on\ndual enrollment, one on college\ncompletion grant, and one on STEM\nwaiting for the hope scholarship. And so\nwe just published those in December. And\nlater today, I'll be sure that you get\nthat. Um for college completion grant,\nuh we have awarded\nuh more than 28,000 awards. And the\nreason I say awards and the reason uh we\nuse awards when we're making projections\noftent times a student may receive an\naward in the fall and an award in the\nspring. And what's so neat about the\ncompletion grant and what you all were\ndoing was uh focusing on completion. So\nif we know that a student needs just a\nlittle extra financial help to get them\nacross that finish line, that's where\nthese have been targeted. Um and thank\nyou. I can't say enough about our\npartner institutions. Uh the uh\nprofessional staff in the financial aid\noffices at these institutions are really\nwhat makes this possible. They have the\nrelationships with the students and can\ntell us uh who needs that additional\nhelp.\n>> One other one, Mr. Chair, uh can you\ntell me or how do you anticipate the\ndream scholarship to coordinate with the\ncollege completion?\n>> Yes, ma'am. So, you know, I think we\nhave multiple tools in the toolkit. My\nunderstanding from the vision with the\ndream scholarship is that uh that will\nbe perhaps geared more towards access.\nSo, with students that need some\nadditional help starting their college\njourney and then if we can blend fund\nsources and we can support them with the\ncompletion grant towards the end of\ntheir high school, excuse me, college\nexperience. Um, and so I know as a\nformer employee of the university\nsystem, all of those colleagues are\nlaser focused on student success and\nanything that we can do to support the\nsuccess of the dream scholarship. Uh,\nwhat an honor to be the state of hope\nand dreams.\nI\n>> think that all your questions. We do\nwant to point out a few things though.\nPresident Green, it's your first time\nbeing here. Hope you enjoyed it.\nThank you for the information. And your\npredecessors obviously in the back.\nPresident Riley, thank you. Commissioner\nRiley in the past. Thank you for your\nyears of service, not only there, but\nalso to Fulton County and the House of\nRepresentatives. We're so glad you're\nhere. One last question, though, before\nyou're gone. Uh, you mentioned uh on one\nof your previous slides, you had a I\nthink her name was Reagan Bearden.\n>> Yes.\n>> Do you think she gets her intelligence,\nshe was one of your people you had\nspeak, you think she gets her\nintelligence from her mother or her\nfather? This might be the most difficult\nquestion you answer today. And do\nremember that one of them is an\nappropriator.\nUh, I'm so grateful for the Bearden\nfamily for being such champions of the\nGeorgia match program and it's been a\njoy working uh with Reagan.\nThank you, President Green. I hope you\nhave a good afternoon.\nNext up is\nCommissioner Amy Jacobs with Department\nof Early Learning\nCare.\n>> Hey, um just so everybody knows, all the\npresentations today will be online\nor probably some of them are already um\nbut will be done by the end of the day\non our legislative site under the House\nbudget research tab.\nAll right, turn it over.\n>> Okay, thank you. Well, good afternoon,\nMr. Chairman and members of the\ncommittee. I know you all have had a\nvery long day, so thank you for sticking\naround and hearing about uh the state of\nchild care in our state. uh we know how\nimportant it is for working families,\nfor young children, and of course for\nthe local and state economy to have\naccess to high quality early learning.\nSo over the last five years, we have\nseen a modest increase in our licensed\ncapacity. We've actually seen an\nincrease in our childcare learning s\ncenters of about 4%. We have seen a\ndecrease in our family childcare\nlearning homes. These are smaller\nlearning environments that care for six\nor less children. Uh and that's a\nnationwide issue uh that nationally\nwe're trying to figure out, but overall\nlicense capacity uh has increased by 6%\nover the last five years. So as we end\nuh June of 2025, Georgia had over 3,200\nlicensed childcare centers, over a\nthousand family child care homes, and\n387,000\ntotal licensed capacity for children\nbirth to five. And of course, uh, Decal\nlicensed and monitors each of these\nprograms to make sure they're meeting\nhealth and safety standards. So, our\nchild care and parent services program\nor CAPS is one of our largest and\nprobably most impactful programs. This\nis Georgia's childare subsidy program\nthat provides scholarships for working\nfamilies so that they can send uh their\nchildren to high quality early learning\nwhile they either work or attend school.\nthis uh this program were able to serve\n51,000 children. Uh this is a large\nbudget, so I'm going to point it out\nspecifically. It's $385 million made up\nof both federal CCDF dollars and state\ngeneral funds. In Georgia, we are very\nfortunate to have a very robust quality\nrated system. So this is our system that\ndetermines, improves, and communicates\nthe quality of early learning in\nGeorgia. We have about 2900 child care\nprograms that have received a one, two,\nor three star rating. 98% of children in\nour CAPS program a 10 a quality rated\nprovider. And I point that out because\nwe know that high quality early learning\nis good for all young children, but it's\nreally really impactful for children\nwith low incomes and quality. We have\nquality rated programs in 154 of our\ncounties throughout our state. I know\nyou're all very familiar with Georgia's\nprek program, which remains a national\nleader when you look at quality and\naccess. Since 1992, Georgia PreK has\nserved over two million children, and we\nknow from research that it prepares kids\nfor kindergarten. This school year, uh,\nGeorgia PreK is serving over 68,000\nfour-year-olds. We were able to provide\nover 138 new classrooms. Over 70% of our\nclassrooms have more than 18 students\nand we've been able to reduce the rate\nweight list um from last year to 3,300.\nIf you will remember back in FY25, you\nsupported a historic investment in\nGeorgia PreK of over $97 million. So I\nwanted to touch on uh some of those\nsuccesses. So uh we are in the second\nyear of a class size reduction. Uh we\nwere serving 22 students. Now we have\nclass size of 20. So that's allowed us\nto add over 300 new classrooms all\nthroughout the state over the last two\nyears. And we know smaller class sizes\nare better for young kids. Uh this\ninvestment also allowed us to do teacher\npay parody with our K12 colleagues. Our\nlead teachers uh received a 13% increase\nbecause of this and our assistant\nteachers received a 27% increase. Better\nthan that in my opinion is what we're\nseeing in teacher retention. Due to\nthese increases, we retained about 82%\nof our lead teachers last year and 77%\nof our assistant teachers, and that has\nincreased since this investment was made\ntwo years ago. This investment has also\nallowed us to increase our startup\ngrants for new classrooms. Again, we\nfunded 319 new classrooms, which was a\n$9.6 million investment. We also provide\nrefurbish refurbishment grants for\ncontinuation classrooms. We've done that\nfor over 1500 classrooms over the last\ntwo years. Operation funding has\nincreased by 27% and for transportation\n9% increase in sites that are actually\nproviding transportation which we know\nsometimes can be a barrier to attending\nGeorgia PreK.\nYou may remember Georgia's preK also has\na summer transition program. We operate\ntwo models in the summer for five weeks.\nUh one is our rising prek and this is\nfor children that are Spanish speaking\nor children with disabilities that we\nknow need a little extra support before\nthey even enter preK. So, we offer that\nfive weeks before they start their pre-K\nyear. We also offer rising kindergarten\nbecause there are students that are\nidentified as needing additional\nsupport. Maybe they came in late during\nthe year. Uh maybe they have been\nidentified by their teacher as needing\nextra support. So, we provide them with\nfive weeks after pre-K before they enter\nkindergarten. This is a smaller program,\nbut it is part of our prek program. It\nis funded with lottery dollars. Our\nrising prek program, we have 69\nclassrooms and our rising kindergarten,\n326.\nWe also operate two nutrition programs.\nWe know how important food is for young\nkids. We offer we administer the child\nand adult care food program, which is\nCACFP,\nuh which allows us to reimburse for 65.7\nmeals throughout our state in 157\ncounties. And we also offer a summer\nfood program which is Happy Helpings uh\nwhich reimbures for meals for nonprofits\nto serve meals during the summer when\nkids school age kids do not have access\nto meals. This last summer they served\n2.9 million meals in 109 counties.\nSo I'm going to move on uh to our\nbudget, but I always like to show uh our\nfund source split. We are heavily funded\nby federal funds. 48.7%\ncomes from federal funds, which are two\nfederal funding sources. CCDF childcare\ndevelopment fund in USDA. We receive uh\nover 45% from the state lottery to fund\nour Georgia prek program and 6.2% of\nstate general funds. All of which goes\nto our subsidy program.\nSo, uh this is real quick. We don't have\nany changes the amended, but I did want\nto acknowledge the $2,000 supplement uh\nthat the governor added for all state\nemployees and for prek lead and\nassistant teachers. I know our team is\nvery appreciative of that. And then for\nFY2027 for the governor's budget\nrecommendation, our changes are all in\nthe preK program. So all lottery\ndollars. This is page 165. Uh number six\nis a actual decrease in $125,000.\nAs as I said, um our teacher on the T&\nschedule just like K12 teachers and this\nis just how it ended up this year. So\nthere's a slight reduction of $125,000.\nUh number seven is an increase in the\nper member per month SHBP increase. We\nhave about 50% of our classrooms are in\npublic schools. So they are part of\nSHBP. And this is to reflect that\nincrease an increase from 1885 to 2028.\nSo an addition of $5.8 million that will\ngo directly to those school systems to\npay those SHP bills. And then number\neight, we are in our third year of a\nfour-year phase in of reducing our class\nsize. So, we asked for four years to do\nthat because we knew we would need to\nadd 400 classrooms to reduce the class\nsize to 20. So, this is an additional\n$12 million to add an additional 100\nclasses next year.\nSo, that was um I tried to be brief. I\nknow you've been here a long time, but\ncover it all. So, I'm happy to answer\nany questions.\n>> Thank you. Uh director, I have my first\nquestion is this. if you don't mind\ntaking a minute. One of the questions\nwe've got a lot is, of course, the\nissues that are going on in Minnesota\nrelating to child care facilities.\nObviously, we feel like we're in a lot\nbetter position in Georgia. You spent\nmuch of your December talking to us\nthrough that. But if you would, for the\nsake of edification for the other\nmembers who maybe did not get that\ninformation, let them know why. We at\nleast feel like George is in a much\nbetter position.\n>> Absolutely. Um, so we believe we have\nseveral levels of safeguards to prevent\nuh fraud and to detect fraud. When we\nthink about sending money out the door,\nespecially as it relates to our\nchildcare subsidy program or our CAPS\nprogram, our first level of defense is\nour childcare licensing staff. They\nvisit licensed programs a minimum of two\ntimes a year unannounced. Also, when we\ngrant a new license, we actually visit\nthe center and make sure or the family\nchildcare home and make sure that they\nare up and operating. they have staff\nhired. Um they have a director on board\nwho's done the training. So that's our\nfirst level of defense. Um but we also\nrequire providers to track attendance.\nSo they have to have a sign in sign out\nsheet of a a parent or a guardian sign\nthose children in and out and then they\nhave to submit that attendance to us on\na weekly basis to be build. Then we have\na billing system in place which would\ncheck for any type of irregularities.\nFor example, if a provider is billing\nfor more children than their actual\nlicense capacity, or if a if a two\nproviders are billing for the same exact\nchild, our system would pick that up. We\nwould flag it. Uh our CAP staff would\nwork on that. But we also have a\ndedicated audits and compliance division\nthat work on this on a regular basis.\nSo, of course, they take any type of\ncomplaints. They would investigate, but\nthey also use a risk assessment model uh\nto identify any programs that might need\na little extra attention from us. And\nthen anyone can can uh report fraud to\nus through our website, through our\nemail, and then we have a 1-80088GA\ntip line to uh report fraud.\n>> Thank you. Just to summarize that up,\nfirst we don't open up a facility unless\nwe personally visited it to begin with.\nSecond, we do two unannounced visits a\nyear. We even did those during COVID. We\nalso require signin signout sheets of\nthe parents before payments ever issued.\nAnd we issue payments in a rears. That's\nbeen something that's come up time and\ntime again of whether or not we should\nissue payments on the front end for\nchild caring child care placing\nagencies. We do it in a rears again as a\nfight against fraud. I hope that helps\ny'all understand that and provides you\nwith some ammunition when you're talking\nback in your districts to to um your\nconstituents. Thank you for that.\n>> Yes, sir.\n>> Senator Sims,\n>> thank you.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you uh\nCommissioner for your words of wisdom.\nGeorgia spends a lot of money on child\ncare. Uh that has a curriculum that\nembraces\num an academic\num what do I want to say? An academic\naura that is not very challenging. Um\nwhat are we going to do? Because when we\nhave these children in these classrooms,\nthat's a captive audience right there.\nWe can strengthen the literacy rates. We\ncan strengthen STEM. We can strengthen\nanything. So by the time they get to\nkindergarten,\nthey're prepared for learning. Okay. But\nwe still tend to have a curricula\nthat is very weak. What are we going to\ndo to embrace? That's number one. Number\ntwo, and tell me about the pay\ndiscrepancies between rural, urban,\nmetropolitan providers because I get a\nlot of complaints from providers in my\ndistrict. Thank you.\n>> So on your curriculum question, I will\nsay specifically for Georgia PreK, we\nhave a Georgia early learning and\ndevelopment standards, which are\nlearning standards for birth to five\nthat align directly with our K12\nstandards. They were just updated to\nmatch our K12 standards. They just did\nan update around literacy and math, I\nbelieve. And then we have a list of\napproved curricula that match those. So,\nI don't know that I would say our\ncurricula is is weak in Georgia. I'm\nhappy to talk more about specifically\nwhat you mean by that because you\nprobably have better examples than I do,\nbut we go through a very rigorous\ncurricula\nthat meet all of the standards that we\nwould want to meet in Georgia PreK.\nspecifically\n>> who's responsible for creating the\ncurricula? Is it uh do we have statewide\nadvisors or\n>> So we go through a curricular review\nabout every five years and vendors\nsubmit those to us. We usually have an\noutside body. Sometimes it's the\nUniversity of North Carolina FPG which\nis a leader in in reviewing things like\nthat. Sometimes it's the University of\nGeorgia. But we also have we always have\noutside reviewers to make those\ndecisions on those approved list.\n>> Thank you. Well, what we've done was we\nspent a lot of money in education. I\nwant and I think all of us would like to\nsee a better return on the investments\nthat we make in education. We are\nspending so much time on literacy\nbecause our children can't read. We're\nspending a lot of that. There's not only\nand there's math literacy as well. If\nthe the earlier we begin with children\nlearning academically and not just play\nplay every day. I think the better we're\ngoing to be.\n>> I completely agree with you. I think the\nearlier we start the better which is why\nI'm proud that we have 2900 childare\nprograms that are quality rated. So we\nknow that those children that attend\nthose programs are experiencing that\nhigh quality learning environment which\nis the crucial part for brain\ndevelopment. Your second question was\nabout different rates in different parts\nof um the state. So, we do have\ndifferent rates for our cap subsidy. I\nthink that might be what you're\nreferring to. And that's based on a\nmarket rate study that we do every two\nto three years. We're required to do\nthat. It basically looks at all of the\ncost um all around the state and we set\nthose rates based on that. So, that's\nbased on rates we collect throughout the\nstate.\n>> Excuse me. One more thing,\n>> Mr. Spe Mr. Chair,\n>> last time. Okay. Do you mind if I speak\nwith you about the provider pay because\nit is really a problem?\n>> Absolutely.\n>> Without our providers being able to stay\ncompetitive.\n>> Absolutely.\n>> Thank you,\n>> Chair Lady Dempsey,\n>> Mr. Jacobs. Yes. I just want to say\nthank you. And sort of along the lines,\nI think of what Senator Sims was trying\nto say is um the way I see it is that\ny'all are doing an incredible job.\nyou're doing much with little at times\nfor little people. There has been a long\num thought process that much of this is\ntaken care of in home or in other places\nbut in today's world most of our parents\nneed to work must work so those children\nare left for hours without the brain\ndevelopment that is so crucial at that\ntime. I would say that I hope you can\ncontinue to do the curriculum and the\nwork you are doing and that we can\ncontinue to find ways to invest earlier\nand earlier and increase the number and\nthe capacity I would say so that we are\naddressing the literacy rate at the time\nthat is most crucial from\n>> really pre-birth until five.\n>> Yes, I agree. Thank you,\n>> Leader Heagley.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you\nfor your presentation. Um, along those\nlines, do you have uh any idea and your\nthoughts or dreams of when we will be\nable to get to three-year-old prek in\nthis state?\nUh, and we have a great track record\nwith four-year-old prek. And so whenever\nthe investment is there, we're ready to\ngo. Um I do think a small way that we\ncould look at that, which is not as\nexpensive as a universal 3K program, is\nour rising prek program, which is for\nthree-year-olds. It's five weeks during\nthe summer, but at least it gets five\nweeks before you start pre-K. Because\nwhat our research shows us is that those\nchildren who come in with low language,\nmeaning children from poverty, dual\nlanguage learners, or with disabilities,\nthey're coming in behind their peers.\nThat's why we start five weeks early\nwith our rising prek program. They make\nhuge gains during that pre-k year, but\nthey're still leaving behind their\npeers. So, if we can get them earlier\nand earlier, I'm in full support of\nthat. And I think we have the track\nrecord to do a successful program.\n>> One last thing.\nCan you tell us what the impact of the\nfederal budget is having on your budget?\n>> Yes. So, uh, a couple things. There was\nobviously a federal government shutdown\nuh that we went through. Thankfully, we\nwere still able to uh access our funding\nsystem. So, we were still able to draw\ndown our federal dollars. So, there was\nno interruption any in any of our\npayments. Most recently, uh the federal\ngovernment did enact what they call\ndefend the spend. Uh, so we're required\nto provide additional justification when\nwe ask for our weekly draw downs from\nthe feds, but our finance staff has been\nable to provide that level of detail in\na thousand words or less, and we've been\nable to get our funds on time. So,\nthere's been no delay of payments for\nthere.\n>> Representative Glaze,\n>> thank you so much for this wonderful\npresentation. As you know, our children\nare the best of what we have to offer\nthis world. And so what I'm concerned\nabout is um expanding the four-year-old\nso that there is no four-year-old left\nbehind in Georgia trying to get in the\nprogram. We still have many. Speak to\nthat. And also tell me a little bit of\nwhere and how we choose rising prek,\nwhere it's located, and then the rising\nkindergarten. How do we know how many\nthere are and where to locate?\n>> So, let me start with your last\nquestion. So, Rising PreK is an\napplication process and we work with\nexisting preK providers and they're able\nto identify those children that are\nalready identified to enroll in their\npre-K program in the fall with those\ntype of demographics that I talked to\nyou about. So, it's a very based on the\nfunding, that's how we identify them.\nSame with our rising kindergarten. We\nwork directly with programs that have\nthe need for children to attend an\nadditional five uh weeks after\nkindergarten. I'm happy to get you a\nlist of those. It's not as widespread as\num prek, but I'm happy to get you a list\nof those. There has been an expansion\nover the last few years. And you talked\nabout four-year-olds. So, um we are\nseeing a decrease in our enrollment in\nfour-year-olds. Um it sounds like that's\nwhat they're seeing in K through 12. Uh\nthat's what they're seeing nationally.\nPart of that is a decline in birth at\nfive population in Georgia. We we've\ntracked that and it's down over 1%. I\nthink that's part of it. Uh I think\nfamilies are using prek differently. I\nthink some folks are maybe staying at\nhome. So what we're doing is looking at\nany type of barrier. PreK is free, but\nthere are a couple costs. Uh they can\ncharge for meals, especially if they're\nin a childcare center that doesn't have\na food program. And then of course it's\na school day so there's before and after\ncare cost uh that could be there for\nworking families as well. So we're\nlooking at those barriers. We're also\ngoing to increase our marketing. We've\nnever had to do marketing for Georgia\nPreK. Uh so we're going to increase our\nmarketing and uh we have just contracted\nwith the Carl Vincent Institute of\nGovernment at UG to do an even bigger\nstudy. So we can actually ask the\nparents that are not attending Georgia\nPreK why to see if we can um address any\nof those issues. So, a couple things in\nthe works.\n>> Thank you, Commissioner Jason Jacobs.\n>> Thank you.\n>> Thank you.\n>> All right. Chairman Tiller, you want to\nhand over that?\n>> I can.\nNext, we're heading over into a little\ndifferent area. Our Chief Justice Nells\nPeterson, Georgia Supreme Court. It\nlooks like he's bringing somebody for\nbackup there with him.\nwork.\n>> Justice Peterson, we we didn't start the\nincrease for judicial safety yet, but I\ndo see you've uh you've chosen on your\nown. Judge Chief Judge Brown, it's nice\nto see you. Thank you for joining.\n>> We got you turned on. Go ahead.\n>> Well, thank you very much. Thank you,\nuh, Chairman, uh, members of the\ncommittee. Appreciate the opportunity to\nbe here. I know you're running uh behind\nand so I will try to hit the high points\num and obviously we'll answer whatever\nquestions y'all may have. Um the court\nof appeals and and the Supreme Court\nhave worked really closely together uh\nin arriving at these budget requests to\ntry and be as aligned as possible. Um\nour budgets are fairly simple. Uh and so\nthere are two kind of key policy issues\nthat both of our budget requests share\nand we thought it would be a good idea\nfor me just to start by talking about\nthose two policy issues before we go\ninto the budget specifics. And the first\nis security. Um\nthere is a critical security gap for the\nappellet courts, the statewide courts\nthat needs to be closed. Um and the\nthreat environment over the last uh few\nyears has really changed. The threat\nenvironment used to be focused on\ncourthouse security. Think to the Brian\nNichols case for example. But the\nincidents that we have seen the last\nseveral years and there have been far\ntoo many of them including one yesterday\nin Indiana where an Indiana judge and\nhis wife were shot through his front\ndoor. um have all been at home and so\nthe security environment and the threats\nthat we are looking at that the system\nneeds to be able to address are\ndifferent and require different\napproaches. Um almost every trial court\njudge in this state has a local law\nenforcement agency that is responsible\nuh for providing security when necessary\nfor for local judges um including\nsuperior court judges who are state\njudges just at you know for the the\nlocal circuit. Um, but there are 25\nstate judges who do not have a law\nenforcement agency responsible for their\nsecurity outside of the courthouse. The\neight justices of the Supreme Court who\nare not the chief, the 15 judges of the\ncourt of appeals, and then the judges of\nthe statewide business court and the new\ntax court. The Georgia State Patrol does\nand continues to do a terrific job of\nprotecting the Nathan Deal Judicial\nCenter. Uh, and their executive\nprotection division has done and I have\nrecently learned continues to do a great\njob of protecting the Chief Justice.\nBut it is not the State Patrol's\nresponsibility to provide general\nprotection for any of the other\nstatewide judges, nor do they have the\nresources to do it. During Chief Judge\nBogs's tenure, uh, a new judicial\ncouncil standing committee on judicial\nsecurity was created. Uh, that's led by\nJustice Sean Ellen Lrua and Court of\nAppeals Judge Brian Rickman. And that\ncommittee had a team of high level law\nenforcement and security experts review\nsecurity for the statewide courts. And\nthat that team's conclusion was that\nserious gaps existed and needed to be\nclosed.\nAs part of addressing that conclusion,\nwe used existing funds to contract with\nStan Cooper from the Department of\nCorrections in the back. Many of you all\nknow him. Um, a longtime security expert\nwith the Department of Corrections. And\nwith substantial support from the\nDepartment of Corrections, Stan has been\nworking and has done great work to help\naddress those gaps. Uh, but he is\nretiring from corrections, which is\nbrought an end to to their uh their\nassistance with that. I am very grateful\nto the commitment the Department of\nCorrections has had and the support they\nhave offered. So that's problem number\none. Problem number two is for as far as\nI can tell for the history of Georgia,\nthere has been no statewide coordination\nor data collection for judicial security\nissues across Georgia's 1600 judges. On\nthe federal level, the US Marshall\nService tracks very closely threats\nagainst federal judges. uh over 500\nthreats against federal judges in FY25,\nbut we have had no statewide tracking or\ncoordination of those sorts of issues on\nthe state and local level. Um much less\ncoordination on things like training and\nbest practices, um identification of\nresources across jurisdictions. And so\npart of what Stan has also been doing\nhas been establishing a a threat\ntracking process for the judges. Um and\nalong with Justice Lagura, Judge Rickman\nand wonderful state law enforcement\npartners, especially at GIPstick,\ncoordinating statewide training and\nidentifying and establishing best\npractices across the state and across\nall the classes of court. These\nfunctions have been sorely needed and\nare making an enormous difference across\nthe state already. But Stan's role has\nbeen as a temporary contractor. um we\nneed to make permanent his role as\ndirector of judicial protection services\nand provide that role the resources it\nneeds. So the budget requests you see in\nboth of our budgets are a coordinated\neffort for the two courts to combine\ntheir efforts to do that and to do it in\nas efficient and as cost-effective a\nmanner as possible. The request is for\nwe have equal amount requests because\nthe plan is we will share the costs\nequally but it's for two positions. the\ndirector of judicial protective services\nand then an operations coordinator.\nThere's a separate request just over\n50,000 in each budget for a vehicle for\neach. Those two positions are\nprincipally about coordination, threat\nassessment and mitigation uh training,\ninvestigations, proactive policy work\nand protection services. And many of\nthese functions will pay dividends not\njust for the statewide courts but for\nall of Georgia's 1600 judges. The other\npart of the request is for a $100,000\nfund from which in the event of a\nspecific threat that requires a security\npresence for a judge or justice for a\nlimited period of time, the director can\nhire offduty local law enforcement\nofficers to provide that security for\nthe time that it is needed. If you will,\nthis approach is really just the the\nsecurity equivalent of just in time\nlogistics.\nIt does not involve creating new law\nenforcement positions beyond these two,\ndriving judges around in black SUVs, or\nproviding constant security for\nstatewide judges when it's not needed in\nresponse to a specific credible threat.\nBut it does ensure that when, not if, a\ncredible threat comes, we have the\nresources and protocols in place to\naddress this threat swiftly and\nefficiently. And whatever part of that\n$100,000 fund isn't needed for that\nwould be returned at the end of the\nyear.\nThat's the security pitch. And then the\nsecond piece, um, which y'all have\nalready recognized is critically\nimportant because you invested in it\nlast year, is is our crisis for staff\nretention, particularly among staff\nattorneys uh, at the two courts. And our\nrequests there are just to annualize\num, the six-mon salary increase that\nthat you funded last year. Uh but both\nof our courts have experienced roughly\n75% staff attorney turnover over the\nlast five to six years. That is\ncatastrophic for institutions like like\nappellet courts. It is unsustainable and\nit is it is new. It is not the historic\nexperience. Um and it really is critical\nto retain those people who who are the\nengine uh of the courts. Last year you\nfunctioned you you funded two retention\ninitiatives for our courts. We're very\ngrateful for that. Um the lion share was\nfor salary enhancements for staff\nattorneys and other critical\nprofessional staff. Um\nthe FY26 budget made those enhancements\neffective January 1st of this year. And\nso the the FY27 budget just uh seeks to\nannualize that. And also, um, if you do\ndecide to fund the governor's\nrecommendation of two $2,000 bonuses for\nstate employees, obviously we didn't\nrequest that in our budget, and we would\nwe would ask that our staff get to\nparticipate in that as well. Those are\nthe two big policy high points uh that\nuh we were asked to touch on uh and I\nhave I am happy to go line by line\nthrough the Supreme Court budget if you\nwould uh like that. I'm happy to We're\nboth happy to take questions at this\npoint. What would you prefer us to do?\n>> If you'd hit the high points of the\nbudget, I don't need to know every line,\nbut\n>> Sure.\n>> Um, so in the amended budget, the only\nrequest we have is a pass through from\nDPS that that we do every year. Um, the\nhigh points of the budget, um, there's a\n604,000 $65,000\nnumber there. Uh the majority of that is\nannualizing\nthe increase in judicial uh compensation\nthat y'all very generously uh enacted\nand funded last year. It was funded\neffective January 1st and so we have to\nannualize that judicial salary. The\nremainder of that line is just the\nannual request that we will make for a\nsalary increase up to the maximum\nauthorized amount that the salary model\ncontemplated in the statute\ncontemplates. Um, and that's entirely up\nto to y'all's discretion as as are all\nthings uh in this space. Um, and other\nthan the security piece, that is the\nhigh points of the of the Supreme\nCourt's budget.\n>> Chief Judge Brand,\n>> I don't know that I have any high\npoints. Welcome to field uh any\nquestions. Really, if you look at the\nFY26, the amended budget, the only thing\nthat we asked for that's a larger ticket\nitem is the 197 197,000 where we're\ntransitioning from a uh a hardware\nredundancy in our IT program and into\nthe cloud. Uh that's anticipated that\nthat will be a yearly expense, but\nthat's the first of that. Uh the 625 in\nthe amended budget is basically our\nshared cost of the security director and\n$40,000 not really a high point. We uh\nour last judge required um commuting\nfees. Um\nlike the chief justice said in the high\npoint is the salary increase. We're\nlooking to uh annualize not only the\njudges and we certainly appreciate uh\nthe the salary enhancements that we\nreceived last year. We are going through\na crisis. The numbers should shake you\nto your core when you when you think\nabout the few people who are able to\nserve as our very talented staff\nattorneys. There's only few that are\nable to do that and there's fewer still\nthat are willing to do that. and we're\nlosing them at a faster pace than we can\ntrain them right now. Um, we don't\nexpect they don't expect to make the\nmoney that they're going to make in\nprivate practice. We just got to get a\nlittle closer. A lot of what we're able\nto offer uh to work with us as opposed\nto private is starting to balance out\nbetween us and the private sector.\nThere's even there's areas of the public\nsector that we now compete with that\nthey're actually taking some of our\nstaff. Um\nI don't there's really nothing else in\nhere unless there was a specific\nquestion about anything on our budgets.\nWe again we appreciate the the salary\nenhancements. We hope that you will\nannualize those especially for our staff\nand and staff attorneys.\nWelcome answer any questions.\n>> Chairman Gullet.\n>> Thank you. Uh thanks for being here.\nThanks for what you do for our state. Um\nthe $40,000 commuting budget. Tell me a\nlittle bit about that. I'm not familiar\nwith that.\n>> So, uh the the judge that Judge Davis\nreplaced was a judge that worked within\nthe metro area. So, she did not have a\ncommuting budget. When he came on, he\ndoes commute. So, we have to add to the\nbudget to replace or actually fill the\nthe need.\nThis is about $40,000 a year.\n>> Every judge or justice, I'm assuming\nthis\n>> outside of outside of 50 miles outside\nof 50 miles were able to get per DM as\nwell as mileage once a week.\n>> Okay. Thank you.\n>> So that's $40,000\nper judge that lives outside of 50\nmiles.\n>> The way I understand it is that's the\nmaximum. If someone comes in every\npotential day, 35 days, uh, per term,\nthree terms, a year, uh, plus mileage,\nthat it maxes out at about 40,000. And\nthat judge probably lives as far away as\nyou can.\nSo, most likely if he takes advantage of\nall the days that it would be about\n$40,000.\n>> And so, in the amended, is it in the\namended you're asking for 40,000? So,\nthat's half a year. So, is it 80,000?\nNo. 40,000. Uh he came in January one,\n>> right?\n>> So that's for\n>> six months,\n>> right?\n>> Well, we've had to pay it out as well.\n>> Okay. But it's $40,000 annualized.\n>> $40,000 annualized.\n>> Do you know how many\n>> I'm not hold you to it. How many live\noutside the\n>> Are we half\nare we\nprobably seven or eight out of 15?\n>> Okay. Thank you.\nChairman Carpenter,\n>> is there a possibility to do like a line\nitem veto on a few of the judges that we\ndon't think near as highly of as the\nothers?\n>> I thought you had a real question.\n>> Been a long day, coach.\n>> I wanted to start out with a motion to\nrecuse uh Chairman Carpenter, but I I\ndidn't.\n>> Justice and judge, thank you. That's all\nthe questions. Appreciate y'all coming\ntoday.\n>> Thank you very much. Appreciate your\ntime and appreciate your commitment.\n>> Members, we are done. We'll see you back\nat 8 a.m. in the morning right here.\n>> Casey's bringing breakfast.\nOh, and tomorrow, hey, uh the rural\ncaucus has invited us to lunch tomorrow.\nU Mary Max. So, so keep that in mind in\nthe morning. We need to have plenty of\ntime for lunch when you're asking your\nquestions. Have a good night.",
