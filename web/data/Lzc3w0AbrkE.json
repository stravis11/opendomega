Good morning.\n>> I have the honor and pleasure this\nmorning of introducing the Reverend\nGeorge Wilcox Brown III.\nAlso happens to be my first cousin.\nHis father and my mother were brother\nand sister and grew up in with their\nother two siblings in Griffin, Georgia.\nAnd as the only boy in my family will\nwas a brother I never had. And I think\nwe got a picture of him somewhere here.\nSo I'm the one on the left, cool and\ncollected, and he's on the one on the\nright, you know, acting a fool.\nAnd he still does that today a good bit.\nSo um born only seven days apart. Um\nMarch 31st, March 23rd, we spent our\nyouth terrorizing my sister. Um hunting,\nfishing on the farm. Every weekend we\ncould spend together. We tried to over\nholidays. great childhood and I was his\nbest man in his wedding a few years\nback. But he was born and raised in\nGriffin, spent his high school years in\nVirginia, uh attended the University of\nthe South at Swany and Yale Divinity\nSchool. He was a Thomas J. Watson fellow\nand spent a year living with Christian\nmonks in Europe, Africa, and the South\nPacific.\nHe was ordained a priest in the\nEpiscopal Dasis of Georgia in 2006. He\nserved for 12 years in Dallas, Texas and\nhas been a priest at All Saints\nEpiscopal Church in Thomasville, Georgia\nsince 2018. He's published a book on\ntheology and conservation, worked for\nseveral years as a consultant in the\narea of marine fisheries policy at both\nthe state and federal levels. He's an\navid hunter and outdoorsman and\nfisherman. He's married to Kate. They\nhave two children, George Tucker and\nStella May, and an English cocker named\nGeneral Borgar. His great great great\ngreat-grandfather James Epinger was a\nmember of this body, George House, from\n1837 to 1841. Friends, I give you the\nReverend Will Brown.\nGood morning. This is uh biggest church\nI've ever been in, I think. Uh it's an\nhonor to be here and thank you, Mr.\nSpeaker, and thank you, cousin\nrepresentative.\nUh some of you know uh Representative\nCannon got his start in field artillery.\nUh and it's fair to say I think that he\nreally got his start when we were kids\nand we used to shoot each other with BB\nguns and bottle rockets and that went on\nuntil he shot me in the eye one day and\nthen our parents put a quick halt to\nthat. But I think that's how he got his\nstart in artillery. That's probably how\nI got my start as a man of peace.\nFirm believer in peace now. It's one of\nthe few things I have in common with\nSaddam Hussein's army as I've been shot\nat by Colonel Cannon.\nOn a serious note, I want to uh\nacknowledge everybody here who served in\nour military and our law enforcement and\nemergency services. All the people here\nwho willingly have put themselves\nbetween us and the things, the powers in\nthe world that would do us harm. I never\nserved myself, but I've told my wife I'm\na veteran of a thousand psychic wars.\nAnd that's a good place to start with\nwhat I want to say to you today in\nbrief. We are at war. If you look at the\nnews, I think you'll intuitively know\nwhat I'm talking about. We are at war.\nIt's a spiritual war. And we, I think,\nreflexively think that spiritual means\nnebulous and sort of unreal. But in\nfact, the opposite is the case. And\nlately, it's kind of starting to break\nout into the material order and not\nleast into the domain of our politics.\nMy dear legislators,\nin a certain sense, you are on the front\nlines of this war. And I want to distill\na little bit of wisdom from God's word\nfor you this morning.\nFirst, St. Paul said, \"We're fighting\nfor an immortal crown.\" Which means the\nstakes in this world, in this war. The\nstakes are eternal stakes.\nSecondly, our enemies are not who we\nthink they are. We fight not against\nflesh and blood, not against people, but\nagainst principalities, against powers,\nagainst the world rulers of this present\ndarkness, against spiritual wickedness\nin high places.\nWe're fighting against three things. A\ncorrupt and deathbound world system,\nagainst Satan, and against the lusts of\nour own flesh.\nIn his great work, which some of you\nhave probably read, the Gulag\narchipilago,\nAlexander Sultaniten contemplated how\nRussia in his day became such a\ntotalitarian hellscape and he came to\nthis conclusion. He said, \"Grdually, it\nwas disclosed to me that the line\nseparating good and evil passes not\nwhere we think, not between nations and\nstates, not between classes of people or\nraces, or even between political\nparties. But the line separating good\nand evil runs through the middle of\nevery human heart.\nWe all have the potential to do good or\nto do evil.\nThree, that puts your work as\nlegislators into a pretty important\nlight.\nOur Georgia Constitution says that our\ngovernment exists to perpetuate the\nprinciples of free government, to ensure\njustice to all, to preserve peace, to\npromote the interest and happiness of\nthe citizen and of the family, to\ntransmit to posterity the enjoyment of\nliberty. That's a pretty good\ndistillation of the principles of\nliberal government everywhere. But\nhere's the thing. In 1798, John Adams\nwrote to the Massachusetts militia. His\nwords are as apt or more apt perhaps\ntoday than they were in 1798.\nsaid this, \"We have no government armed\nwith power capable of contending with\nhuman passions unbridled by morality and\nreligion. Our constitution, and this\napplies to our Georgia Constitution as\nwell as to our federal constitution, our\nconstitution was made only for a moral\nand religious people, and it is entirely\ninadequate for the government of any\nother.\nThat means that your work as a\nlegislature is hard and I think it's\ngoing to get harder as time goes on. But\nit's also crucially important.\nAnd it means your work has to begin in\nyour own heart and in your own home with\nyour own family and your own\nrelationships with other people.\nAnd only with such a beginning, only\nwith such a grounding, will your work in\nthis place be a radiant blessing to your\nconstituents and to the rest of our\nstate and to our nation as God intends\nit for to be.\nIf you'll bow your heads, I want to pray\nfor you.\nStand if you're able.\nAlmighty God, fountain of all wisdom,\nyour statutes are good and gracious, and\nyour law is truth. We thank you for the\nstate of Georgia, our home. You've given\nthis good land to us for our heritage.\nWe humbly ask you that we may always\nprove ourselves a people mindful of your\nfavor and glad to do your will. Bless\nour state with honorable industry, sound\nlearning, and pure manners. Save us from\nviolence, discord, and confusion, from\npride, and arrogance, and from every\nevil way. Defend our liberties and\nfashion into one united people the\nmultitudes whom sin, Satan, and\nself-interest would seek to divide.\nGuide and bless this house. endo its\nmembers with the spirit of wisdom\ntogether with the Senate and with our\ngovernor and especially today we pray\nfor the judiciary\nall of whom we the citizens have\nentrusted with the authority of\ngovernment. Grant that this body may\nobtain may ordain for our governance\nonly such things as please you to the\nglory of your name and the welfare of\nour people. Grant that there may be\njustice and peace throughout Georgia and\nthat through obedience to your law we\nmay show forth your praise among the\nstates of our nation and among the\nnations of the earth. In the time of\nprosperity fill our hearts with\ngratitude and in the day of trouble\nsuffer not our trust in you to falter.\nAll of which we ask through Jesus Christ\nyour son our Lord. Amen.\nIf you'll remain standing and join me in\nthe pledge. I pledge allegiance\nfor all.\nDoorkeepers, you may unlock the doors.\nNow, that was that. You didn't you\ndidn't even the score with him when he\ntalked about that photo of you as\nbabies. But I can look at these two and\nI know who won the battles when they\nwere growing up though. Don't y'all\nknow? No doubt. Brother Will, thank you\nfor those words. They are inspiration to\nus. We appreciate you being here. You\nmay join Brother Will in the South Annie\nroom and give him your thanks for being\nhere. U Chairlady Taylor.\nChair lady Darlene Taylor, would you\njoin us up on Chair Lady Taylor?\nWould\nyou join us?\nmembers. Our doctor of the day is Dr.\nShami Das\nand Dr. Das is brought to us by\none of our own representative Mary\nMargaret Oliver. Thank you for bringing\nour doctor of the day today.\nChairman Hilton, the chair of the\ncommittee on information and audits is\nrecognized. Chairman Hilton.\n>> Good morning, Mr. Speaker. Your\ncommittee on information audits has read\nthe journal the previous legislative day\nand we found it to be correct.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

But for those in\nCamden County, the trimmers didn't just\nshake the earth. They shatter families,\nsilenced a generation of mothers, and\nleft a scar on our state's history. On\nFebruary 3rd of 1971, theo Chemical\nCorporation building one M132 wasn't\njust a factory. It was a place where\ndreams were being built. At a time when\nopportunities were scarce, hundreds of\nlocal residents,\nprimarily black women, went to work each\nand every day. But at 10:53 a.m., a\nspark in a curing room turned the\nbuilding into a furnace. The fire was\nswift and the explosion took 29 lives.\nAnd Mr. Speaker, if I can have everyone\nto stand as we remember these heroes and\nshurros,\nuh, Georgians that died on February 3rd,\n1971.

And now to introduce our chief\njustice here. And it gives me great\npleasure to introduce honorable Nell SD\nPeterson Chief Justice Supreme Court of\nGeorgia. Justice Peterson was appointed\nto the Supreme Court by Governor Nathan\nDeal in 2016 and assumed office as the\nChief Justice of the Supreme Court on\nApril 1, 2025. Prior to his time on the\ncourt, he served in a variety of other\nroles in Georgia state government,\nincluding as a judge on the Georgia\nCourt of Appeals, general counsel to the\nUniversity System of Georgia, Georgia's\nfirst solicitor general in the attorney\ngeneral's office, the executive counsel\nto the governor. Before entering the\nstate government, he practiced law in\nAtlanta and clerked for Chief Judge\nWilliam H. Prior Jr.\nof United State Court of Appeals of the\n11th Circuit. He is a proud graduate of\nKennesaw State University and Harvard\nLaw School. He serves on numerous\ngovernment nonprofit boards and\ncommittees and has received a variety of\nhonors and awards. He lives with his\nwife and two children in Cobb County.\nAnd it is my honor to present you today\nthe Justice of the Supreme Court, the\nHonorable Nails Peterson.\nLieutenant Governor Jones, Speaker\nBurns, President Prom Walker, Speaker\nProm Jones, members of the General\nAssembly,\nPresiding Justice Warren, and my fellow\njustices, Chief Judge Brown and my\nfriends on the Court of Appeals, other\njudges and fellow Georgians.\nEvery year, the governor reports on the\nstate of the state, and that report\nalways includes the announcement of\nsignificant policy proposals and budget\npriorities. The subjects of that speech\nare critical to your work as\nlegislators.\nThis speech is different. Unlike the\ngovernor, the courts have no formal role\nin the legislative process.\nSometimes chief justices use this as a\ntime to brag on the good work of Georgia\ncourts or talk about promising judicial\nbranch policy initiatives. And I'll do\nsome of that because there's a lot of\ngreat work to tell you about.\nBut today, I principally want to talk to\nyou about what the judicial system is\nfor and to remind us all of the role we\nmust each play to support and defend the\nrule of law.\nCentral to the rule of law is the idea\nthat no person is above the law's\nrequirements or beneath its protections.\nIt's the idea that law applies equally\nto everyone and the courts apply it\nimpartially and independently.\nAnd today I can proudly report that the\nstate of Georgia's judiciary is strong\nbecause Georgia's commitment to the rule\nof law is strong.\nThe state of our judiciary will remain\nstrong only so long as we remain\ncommitted to the rule of law. The rule\nof law has always required defending and\ntoday is no exception. The judicial oath\ncalls Georgia judges to do equal rights\nfor the poor and the rich. In other\nwords, for the weak and the powerful. Of\ncourse, the rule of law is rarely tested\nwhen the powerful or the popular win in\ncourt. Results that go the other way can\nsometimes be a different matter. The\nrule of law has always been fragile\nbecause by its very nature, it requires\nthe strong and the rich to accept\nresults in favor of the weak and the\npoor. It requires popular majorities of\nall kinds to accept outcomes in favor of\nsmall unpopular minority groups. It\nrequires the most powerful of all, the\ngovernment, to accept and obey limits on\ngovernment power.\nThis rule of law that we enjoy as\nAmericans has rarely happened throughout\nhuman history. What we have had in this\ncountry for 250 years, as imperfect as\nit has been, especially here in the\nSouth, is so rare. And yet, we often\ntake it for granted. If we are to\ncontinue to enjoy the many blessings\nthat flow from the rule of law, we\ncannot continue taking it for granted.\nEach of us, all of us must do our part,\nwhatever that may be, to defend the rule\nof law. A critical part is this. When\nyou hear about judicial decisions whose\noutcomes you don't like, don't\nreflexively question the court's\nlegitimacy. It's okay to disagree, even\nto protest. But the rule of law will not\nsurvive when the legitimacy of judicial\ndecisions and those who make them is\nroutinely questioned every time there's\nan unpopular outcome.\nAnd here I should add a word on what the\nrule of law is not. The rule of law is\nnot rule by judges.\nThe law's constraints fall most strongly\non judges. If we push against those\nconstraints, we ourselves undermine the\nrule of law. We must not stray out of\nour limited scope of deciding the cases\nbefore us according to the text of the\nlaw that other people make.\nJudges talk about the rule of law all\nthe time, but it's also critical for the\nlegislature.\nNeither of our branches has the\nauthority or the ability to exercise\nforce. That function is reserved for the\nexecutive. Instead, the work product of\nboth of our branches is just our words.\nJudicial branch words come in a jury's\nverdict or in a written judicial\nopinion. We expect that these mere words\nwill control the outcome of criminal\nprosecutions, decide which parent gets\ncustody of their child, resolve matters\nwith millions of dollars at stake, and\neverything in between, one case at a\ntime.\nLegislative words work a little\ndifferently. One of you puts words on a\npage, and after a lot of work, the rest\nof you press red or green buttons. And\nwith enough green buttons, those words\nreshape Georgia law for everyone.\nThe words on the pages of both branches,\nalthough they operate differently, share\nthis in common. The rule of law is the\nonly thing that give any of our words\npower.\nWithout the rule of law, you are all\nwasting your time and we judges and\nrobes are just playing a strange game of\ndress up.\nThis state capital is a building for\npolicymaking and sometimes even\npolitics. Policymaking and politics are\nteam sports. But judges don't play for a\nteam. We wear robes, not jerseys.\nExcept, I suppose, for the occasional\nSaturday in the fall.\nBut the rule of law depends on judges\nfollowing the law impartially and\nindependently.\nOne key opportunity you have this\nsession to strengthen healthy judicial\nindependence and impartiality is by\npassing House Resolution 251 sponsored\nby Representative Kimberly New. This\nconstitutional amendment would end the\npartisan election of probate judges.\nLast year, you passed House Bill 426,\nalso sponsored by Representative New and\nby Senator Rick Williams, which ended\nthe partisan election of magistrate\njudges, and we thank you for that.\nTaking this final step with HR 251 will\nensure that all elected Georgia judges\nare elected solely on a nonpartisan\nbasis.\nJudges must be impartial and we must\nalso conduct ourselves in such a way as\nto be perceived as impartial.\nRequiring any of us to publicly and\nformally align ourselves with a\npolitical party can only undermine the\npublic's perception of the judiciary is\nimpartial.\nI am grateful to former governors Roy\nBarnes and Nathan Deal for recognizing\nthis truth and for jointly endorsing\nthis constitutional amendment.\nAnother important step that we are\ngrateful you took last year was\nreforming Georgia's judicial\ncompensation system. Representative Rob\nLeverett and Senator Bo Hatchet carried\nHouse Bills 85 and 86, which modernized\nan archaic and splintered system of\ncompensating Georgia's statewide and\nsuperior court judges. And Chairman Matt\nHatchet and Chairman Blake Tillery\noversaw the funding of this system\nconsistent with the new model. We are\ngrateful to you all and we look forward\nto this new model strengthening the\njudiciary over time.\nAnd what better way to transition from\njudicial compensation than to talk about\nhow hard your courts are working. And we\nare. Annually collected statewide trial\ncourt data is not without limitations,\nbut I'd like to highlight case filing\nincreases in a few specific circuits\naround the state. For example, in the\nSouth Georgia circuit between Albenny\nand the Florida border, case filings\nincreased nearly 44% between 2023 and\n2024.\nNe just next door in Dicab cases have\nincreased 17% during the same time\nperiod. And in the Chattahuchi Judicial\nCircuit, which includes Columbus,\nthey've gone up 14%.\nAnd we know that trial courts are\nworking hard across the state because\nappellet court case loads have gone up\nyear-over-year. The Supreme Court's\ndirect appeal case load has gone up 25%.\nThe Court of Appeals direct appeal case\nload in the same time period has gone up\n24%.\nBecause trial courts have to decide a\ncase before an appellet court ever sees\nit. Our appellet trend suggests that the\ntrial court's workload and output has\nbeen trending upward over time.\nNow, while deciding cases is the core\nfunction of the judiciary, there's only\nso much we can say about that. Judicial\nethics rules prohibit us from talking\nabout specific cases. So, our public\nfocus is often instead on judicial\npolicy initiatives. And I'm about to\nshift my focus to some of those. But I\nwant to preface that shift with the\nacknowledgement that our work deciding\ncases is the critical work that courts\ndo. And all the policy stuff is\nsignificant only to the extent that it\nenables and improves our work of\ndeciding cases.\nIn recent years, we have worked to\nimprove the quality and reliability of\ndata related to juvenile courts and\nfoster care, an area of great importance\nand interest to our branches. And I hope\nyou are seeing in the data that you\nreceive uh those results. Our court\nimprovement program in partnership with\nthe Department of Family and Children\nServices is piloting a new model\nintended to reduce the time from removal\nto reunification for Georgia children in\nfoster care. This joint project is\noperating in Cobb Dab Fulton and Gwynet\nand we hope will provide lessons and\nopportunities for expansion.\nAdditionally, the juvenile courts in\nAthens, Clark, Gwinet, and Troop\ncounties are serving as pilot sites for\nGeorgia Thrive, Georgia's new infant\ntoddler court program. The product of\nthe work of many partners across the\nhealth care, child welfare, legal, and\npublic policy communities. This\nmulti-year initiative seeks to address\nthe unique needs and opportunities\nrelated to children from birth to age\nthree who find themselves in our\njuvenile courts\nthrough obviously no fault of their own.\nWe are grateful that legislators\nregularly lend their time to our branch\non on initiatives like this in the\ninterest of helping improve the\nadministration of justice.\nAnd with that service in mind, I want to\ntake this opportunity to publicly extend\nthe condolences of the judicial branch\non the passing of a remarkable woman who\ncommitted her time to serving on our\ncourt's committee on justice for\nchildren and was a tireless voice for\nyoung Georgians, Representative Mandy\nBallinger.\nHer\nlife of service has left a legacy that\nwill echo for generations.\nWe have recently concluded two important\nstudy committees in the judicial branch.\nThe first is the Judicial Council Ad Hoc\nCommittee on Artificial Intelligence in\nthe Courts, led by Justice Andrew\nPinson, Vice Chief Judge Elizabeth Goil,\nand Superior Court Judge Steve Kelly. As\nAI's power and reach continues to\nadvance rapidly, we all have to keep up.\nAnd AI poses both risk and opportunity\nfor the judicial system. On the risk\nside, the most publicized problems are\nlikely the least significant.\nYou may have heard stories about lawyers\nfiling briefs that are AI generated that\ncite non-existent cases because the AI\ntool invented them. That has happened\nhere in Georgia. It shouldn't. And the\nlawyers that have have done it expose\nthemselves to serious discipline under\nexisting rules. But the risk that kind\nof misconduct poses the system is\nrelatively minimal as long as judges\nread the cases that are cited in their\nbriefs. The more significant risks that\nwe know about anyway are things like\nfabricated evidence. AI's capacity to\ngenerate false recordings or images\npresents a serious challenge to the\ncourt systems historic approach to\nauthenticating evidence. We don't yet\nhave answers to these problems, but we\ncontinue to work on them. AI may also\noffer opportunities. As a reminder, a\ncore part of the rule of law is that no\none is beneath the law's protections,\nbut in 2023,\nover 420,000\nGeorgia civil cases involved at least\none party without a lawyer.\nThat's over one-third of the civil cases\nin Georgia's superior state, probate,\nand magistrate courts. And while\nGeorgia's Constitution guarantees the\nright to represent yourself in court,\nit's a safe bet that most of those\n420,000 unrepresented parties lacked a\nlawyer because they couldn't afford one.\nAnd in some counties, even if you can\nafford a lawyer, there may not be one to\nhire. 54 Georgia counties have 10 or\nfewer attorneys and eight counties, up\nfrom seven last year, have no lawyers at\nall. The rule of law cannot be available\nonly to those with access to lawyers.\nAnd as AI tools,\nI agree,\nand as AI tools improve, it may be that\nAI has a role to play in closing that\ngap. But we're not waiting for AI to\nsolve this problem for us. The second\nstudy committee that recently completed\nits work is the Supreme Court Study\nCommittee on Legal Regulatory Reform,\nled by Justice Carla Wong McMillan and\nPresiding Judge Steve Dillard. It's easy\nto look at the problem of unrepresented\nlitigants and decide that the government\nshould just throw money at it. That is\nnot what this committee did.\nThe Georgia Constitution vests the\nexclusive authority for regulating the\npractice of law in the Supreme Court and\nwe do that through the state bar, an arm\nof the court. This committee studied our\nregulation of the practice of law to\ndetermine whether restrictions and\nlimitations\non that we have imposed on non- lawyers\nassisting with legal issues might be\nmaking this problem worse.\nThe committee recommended that the court\nconsider a pilot project in which we\npermit trained non- lawyers to perform\ncertain limited legal tasks.\nOther states have been experimenting\nwith similar models and we have the\nopportunity to use what worked for them\nand to avoid what didn't. As we evaluate\nthis recommendation, I am hopeful that\nour creativity in lifting regulatory\nlimitations may be a useful tool in\nclosing the justice gap and ensuring\nthat no Georgian is beneath the law's\nprotections.\nAnd just as the rule of law requires\nthat all people enjoy the law's\nprotections, it also requires that we\nprotect judges from those who would do\nthem harm because of their rulings.\nThreats against judges have received\nnational attention the last several\nyears. Just a couple weeks ago, an\nIndiana judge and his wife were shot\nthrough their front door by a criminal\ndefendant with a pending case in front\nof him. And the US Marshall Service\nreports more than 560 threats against\nfederal judges during FY2025 alone.\nGeorgia, on the other hand, has never\nhad a process for tracking threats\nagainst Georgia judges comprehensively,\nthanks to the great work of the Judicial\nCouncil Standing Committee on Security\nLed by Justice Shan Ellen Lrua and\npresiding judge Brian Rickman and\nsupported by strategic investments that\nyou have made. We are working toward\nsuch a process. And even with the\nexisting limitations, we have already\ntracked 35 threats against 30 justices\nand judges since late 2024,\nresulting in nine arrests.\nThis year, we will look to build on the\nprogress that we have already made. As I\nmentioned in greater detail several\nweeks ago to the joint appropriations\ncommittees, the Supreme Court and the\nCourt of Appeals budget requests seek a\nmodest increase for funding for a joint\neffort to enhance judicial security that\nif funded will pay dividends across the\nstate. I thank each of you for the\nsupport that you have given us in\nimproving judicial security and I ask\nthat you continue to make it a priority\ngiven all of these challenges. Why do\nGeorgia judges persist in the hard work\nof making the rule of law real for\nGeorgians?\nI think the answer is the same answer\nfor you members of the General Assembly.\nYou too face threats to your security.\nYou too face all sorts of challenges in\nyour community through your service.\nBoth judges and legislators face a lot\nof the same challenges. We are all in\nthis together\nand we all face those challenges headon\nbecause we care about our communities.\nWe care about the people we serve. We\ncare about doing the right thing. And\nabove all, we are committed to\nfulfilling our oaths.\nYour oath is a bit different from our\noath because our roles are different.\nThe judicial oath promises independence\nand impartiality.\nIn contrast, the legislative oath\npromises the exercise of judgment in the\nservice of the interests and prosperity\nof the state. But despite these\ndifferences, both the legislative and\njudicial oaths are rooted in the promise\nto uphold the Constitution of the State\nof Georgia and the Constitution of the\nUnited States. When we take these oaths,\nwe make a promise to our communities. We\nmake a promise to those who elected us.\nWe make a promise to our families. And\nfor many of us, we also make a promise\nto God.\nThis aspect of the oath as a promise to\nGod has shaped the history of our legal\nsystem.\nIn fact, in colonial England and for\nmost of our history as a state, criminal\ndefendants were prohibited from\ntestifying under oath, lest in their\ndesire for a quiddle, they brought upon\nthemselves divine judgment. Georgia was\nthe last state in the Union to change\nthat rule. We didn't change it until\n1962.\nIn the Catholic tradition, St. Thomas\nMoore is the patron saint of lawyers.\nBut he wasn't just a lawyer. He also\nserved as speaker of the House of\nCommons\nand then Lord Chancellor of England\nunder Henry VIII. He's a great example\nof both judges and legislators to\nemulate. He ultimately gave his life to\navoid breaking his oath. His commitment\nto keep that promise to God is reflected\nno matter the cost is reflected in his\nlast words which characterized himself\nas the king's good servant and God's\nfirst. That's pretty good. But of\ncourse, as we like to remind our British\nfriends every July 4th and especially\nduring this 250th anniversary of\nAmerican independence here in the United\nStates, we don't have a king. As the\nConstitution makes clear here, the\npeople are sovereign.\nAnd so as\nAnd so as you return to your legislative\nbusiness and we return to our judicial\nbusiness, let us all commit to keep our\noes to the Constitution and the rule of\nlaw it embodies. If we do, we will truly\nbe the people's good servants as we seek\nto be God's first. Thank you. May God\nbless each of you, our great state of\nGeorgia and the United States of\nAmerica.\nThank you, Jess Peterson.\nThoroughly enjoyed that. We greatly\nappreciate that and we greatly\nappreciate all the judiciary members\nhere. Uh and thank you all for your\nservice and dedication to the state of\nGeorgia.\nMr. Doorkeeper,\nplease escort the Chief Justice of the\nJustice Supreme Court and the judges of\nthe Court of Appeals for the Chamber at\nthis time.\nrecognize the proim for a motion.\n>> Thank you, Mr. President.

So be respectful of\nthe member in the well, Representative\nJackson recognized for an afternoon\norder.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker.\nMy moment of black history is one of our\nown, Julian Bond. He used to sit right\nover there where Representative Edna\nJackson sits today. I am a product of\nthe civil rights movement. I was born\ninto a story that was written in in the\nfires of resilience. On January 10th,\n1966\none day before I would enter this world,\nthe Georgia General Assembly uh did not\nallow for Junior Bond to be seated. Uh\nthey refused to seat him because he had\nthe audacity to follow his conscience.\nUh they call his descent unpatriotic,\nbut Junior Bond knew the truth. Uh\nthere's a famous picture that's on the\nfourth floor um that recognized this\nvery thing. But Junior Bond said, \"True\npatriotism is demanding that your\ncountry live up to its own promise.\" And\nwhile he fought for his seat, he didn't\njust give the opportunity for him to not\nbe seated. He picked up his pen. He\norganized. He understood that the\nstruggle for civil rights in Georgia was\ntied to the struggle for human dignity\nacross the globe. But nearly 100 years\nprior to that, September 1868, Henry\nMcNeel Turner, another moment of black\nhistory, stood before the same Georgia\ngeneral, Georgia legislature and protest\nhis expulsion of black representatives.\nIn closing, here we are in 2026, 60\nyears later since Bond was denied, 158\nyears since Turner was expelled. And yet\nwe continue this fight to be heard, to\nbe seen, and to be uh recognized. My\nbirth date, Mr. Speaker, was not a\ncoincidence. It was a commission. And I\ndon't just admire Junior Bond's legacy,\nbut I embrace it every time. time I\nrefuse to be silenced, I am honoring the\nman who was told no so one day I can\ncontinue to say yes. And with that, I\nyield the well.\n>> Thank you, Representative.\nRepresentative\nAli,\nmost important morning order, afternoon\norder, excuse me. Give the gentleman\nyour attention, please.\n>> Mr. Speaker, members of this house,\nthank you once again for allowing me to\ncontinue uh this streak and this\ntradition.
