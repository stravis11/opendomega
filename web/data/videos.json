McLaurin held a press conference to discuss the impending deportation of journalist Mario Guevara by the Trump administration's Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), an executive agency. This is seen as part of a broader pattern of the administration's attacks on free speech and the press.\n\n**Key Actions:**\n- The BIA has issued an order to deport Mario Guevara, a journalist who has been legally residing in the US for decades, with no notice or explanation other than a 13-year-old deportation order that had been paused.\n- Guevara has an active federal court case seeking habeas relief, which the BIA is proceeding to ignore.\n\n**Bills Introduced (First Reading):** \n- None detected.\n\n**Notable Moments:**\n- Sen. McLaurin is joined by Richard Griffiths, a representative of the Georgia First Amendment Foundation and former immigrant journalist, who speaks about the troubling pattern of attacks on the press under the Trump administration.\n- Griffiths expresses how \"dispiriting\" it is to see a journalist thrown out of the country for doing their job.\n- There is an emergency hearing underway in federal court, with the ACLU and other organizations seeking a temporary restraining order to stop the deportation and allow Guevara's case to play out.\n\n**Votes:**\n- None detected.\n\n**Attendance:**\n- No quorum notes.\n\n**Adjournment:**\n- No adjournment information provided.",

Wicks and other legislators condemned as unconstitutional and a threat to democracy. The speakers strongly opposed using the military against American citizens.\n\n**Notable Moments**\n- Sen. Wicks, a retired Army officer, passionately argued that the National Guard uniform should \"never be used to intimidate or divide\" and that its purpose is to \"protect and serve,\" not be misused against the people.\n- Rep. Bell compared the current situation to the dystopian FX series \"American Horror Story\" and urged the National Guard to \"come not with rifles but with rations\" to help the poor and suffering, not oppress them.\n- Rep. Jackson, another veteran, warned that using the National Guard for domestic law enforcement would violate the Posse Comitatus Act and disrespect the distinct roles of the military and law enforcement.\n\n**Opposition to Guard Deployments**\nThe legislators strongly condemned any potential federal deployment of the National Guard in Georgia, calling it unconstitutional, dangerous, and a violation of states' rights under the 10th Amendment. They called on the Governor and all Georgians to resist this \"federal overreach.\"\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe speakers passionately defended the principles of democracy, freedom, and the Constitution, urging resistance against any actions that would \"trample on the dignity of free men and women.\" They declared that \"this is not Nazi Germany\" and that Georgia must remain a \"beacon of democracy.\"",
