brother,\nand friend to many, and he would be surely missed.\nJoe was survived by his wife, Jennifer, his four children, Alexis, Ariana, Landon, and\nLiam, and two grandchildren.\nJoe was a graduate of Roswell High School\nand decided from an early age\nthat he wanted to follow in his grandfather\nand his great-grandfather's shoes in law enforcement.\nHe began his law enforcement career\nat the

officer,\nthen he was a street patrol officer.\nHe next became a detective in our criminal investigation unit.\nAnd then he assisted in multiple cases across the state\nand also in cases with the FBI and the DEA.\nHe was most recently promoted to the status of Lieutenant.\nAs you can see, Joe knew in his heart\nthat service to our Roswell community was his calling.\nHe was the definition of a servant leader in our community.\nHe gave his all to our community,\nbut was also known for his easy smile,\nhis infectious laugh,\nand his love of the legendary rock band Pink Floyd,\nwhich was

There's a gentleman you. Yes. Is it not true that what I'm\nabout to say is I see you. Is it not true that what I'm about to say is not a\nquestion but more so a comment just for awareness purposes. I believe that to\nbe true.\nAnd my comment is that although I am going to support this bill to allow at more members\nto the nursing home administration board, we're in the funeral industry just want to make\ncertain that nursing homes across the state are aware that it's very important that they\nare very mindful of when they make those very sad calls to families when someone passes\naway and the family give them the name of a mortuary to call that they are very mindful\nof making sure they call the right mortuary because that creates a lot of problems for\ntheir families going forward when the wrong funeral home is contacted.\nIs that not true, Mr. Representative Lehu?\nI believe that to be true and I believe that would be a great best practice for providers\nto do that.\nThank you.\nThank you.\nMr. Speaker, I yield the well.\nGentlemen, as yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?\nThe chair here is none.\nThe previous question is ordered.\nIs there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable\nto the passage of the bill?\nThe chair here is none.\nThe report of the committee is agreed to.\nShall this bill now pass?\nAll those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye.\nThose opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines\nHave all members voted\nhave all members voted if so the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 1049\nthe eyes are 159 the nasor 1 this bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is\nis therefore passed.\nClerk will read the caption to House Bill 412.\nHouse Bill 412 by Representative Dempsey\nof the 13th and others to be entitled back to amend\nTitle 43, the official go to Georgia Antietta\nrelating to professions and businesses.\nSo as to provide for the licensure of individuals\nin the practice of applied behavior analysis,\nthis bill I refer to the committee on regulated industries.\nThat committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute.\nChair recognizes Chairman Dempsey to present the bill.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nGood morning, friends, here in the House.\nToday, I bring you an important measure as we all continue to deal with the issues\nconfronted by behavioral health in our communities and with people you love.\nThis is something that can greatly help.\nHouse bill 412.\nI want to direct you to the piece of paper on your desk\nfrom Marcus Autism Center,\na trusted source and resource within our state.\nIt breaks down very specifically what a behavioral\nanalyst does and how important it is.\nThe practice of applied behavioral analysis\nis a distinct profession requiring\ndistinct training and competencies.\nIt treats autism, geriatric patients,\ntraumatic brain injuries, developmental disabilities a word.\nI should be able to say better than that after all of this time.\nBut it deals with those measures.\nThis is a consumer protection and public safety measure,\nwhich also allows for Medicaid billing.\nAs an increasing number of private for-profit providers\nare moving into Georgia and establishing businesses.\nThis will protect not only the person who is being served,\nbut the parent or loved one who is making sure\nthose services are appropriate to make sure\nthat they are licensed, credentialed,\nthey have studied, passed the appropriate exams,\ntake regular certification steps to do that.\nIt allows for an assistant behavior\nand an analyst as well.\nAnd if you, just an example of this, and this is one that I think of so much, and it does\ngo back, because I know it's confusing when you start talking about these measures.\nSomeone who has autism, a young child, I remember the first time I visited Marcus, I watched\nsomeone working with a child who was not able to eat.\nThey had a feeding tube, that sensory deprivation that exists for many people who have brain\ndifferences. That behavioral analyst works in a positive way, reinforcing step after\nstep, but with great patience. This one was particularly teaching the parent as well.\nAt the same time, how you can introduce and keep working and keep working, and eventually\na child who has never eaten may take a long time, but will be able to do that. It is a\nThe slow, arduous, very sensitive process, and we need to treat it that way.\nThis measure went through Gork, it was introduced last year, it was approved by Gork, it was\nalso approved in committee, and I hope that you will support the licensing, the development\nof the board, which also will create for penalties for those who come into our state and are\nare not certified and the limited reciprocity that will allow for temporary licenses.\nIf there are any questions, Mr. Speaker, I will take them.\nIf not, I will yield the wealth.\nYou have a number of questions if you care to yield.\nI will.\nChair recognizes representative Wolenski.\nDo you are left for a question?\nThank you, Speaker.\nDoes the gentle lady yield?\nI do.\nIs it not true that I thank you for carrying this bill and the creation of a certification\nfor behavior analysis is very much needed.\nAnd we'll definitely make it safer\nfor individuals who use this services in their home.\nThe gentleman knows of what he speaks.\nThank you.\nThank you.\nYou further you?\nI do.\nChair recognizes representative Al Williams\nto your left for a question.\nThank you for speaking with the lady.\nYou.\nI certainly will.\nIs it not true that I support this bill?\nAnd the only question I have, and I don't expect you to answer,\nthey haven't read the whole bill,\nbut the qualifications, what are they to,\nthere are a lot of unqualified counselors around.\nThere are, and you know, and I will say this too,\nhaving ABA therapy does not mean that you might not\nalso need other therapies.\nSomeone might need speech, they might need occupational,\nas well, but they are specifically listed in the bill,\nthe training, the education, the testing,\nand it is in compliance with the national rating\nof this as well, the national certification.\nWell, the general lady, for the guild.\nI will.\nIt's not true that my niece and Goddaughter is artistic,\nand I think this is a great build\nto make sure everybody talks,\nknows what they're talking about.\nThank you so much.\nIt has saved many a young life and made life better\nfor those who are in their senior twilight years as well.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nI will yield the well and ask for your favourable consideration.\nIs there any objection to the previous question being ordered?\nThe Chair, here's none.\nThe previous question is ordered.\nIs there any objection to adopting the committee substitute\nto Chair, here's none.\nThe committee substitute is adopted.\nIs there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee,\nwhich was favorable to the passage of the bill.\nThe chair here's none the report of the committee has agreed to.\nShall this bill now pass?\nAll those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye.\nThose opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine.\nI have all members voted, I have all members voted.\nSo the clerk will lock the machine.\nOn the passage of House Bill 412, the eyes are 158.\nThe nays are three.\nThis bill having received the requisite constitutional\nmajority is therefore passed.\nClerk will read the caption.\nThe House Bill 430.\nHouse Bill 430, Governor of the Senate,\nApollo 32 to be titled back to amend chapter 26\nTitle 43, the Fisher-Coda, Georgia, annotated relating to nurses,\nso as to provide for a licensure of advanced practice registered nurses.\nThis bill then referred to the Committee on Regulated Industries.\nThat committee recommends that this bill do pass by Committee Substitute.\nChair recognizes Chairman Allen Powell to present the bill.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker and the ladies and gentlemen of the House to bring you this morning\nHouse Bill 430.\nPretty simple bill, ladies and gentlemen, that allows for the state nursing board to do\nspecific licensure for APRNs.\nRight now, currently the licensing board, the nurses licensing board, authorizes LPNs\nand registered nurses.\nThis takes it a step forward to allow those that have credentials that are considered\nto be APRians and those other nurses that fall within that guideline to be specifically\nlicensed as an APRian.\nGeorgia has about 19,000 APRians as I understand it and we're only one of 11 states that does\nnot allow for specific licensure for those nurses.\nthat I think speaks well because probably one of the unsung heroes that we have in this\nhealthcare delivery system are the nurses or as somebody all may have heard me say over\nthe years they're the ones who keep the doctors from killing us.\nBut because of the lack, because of the shortage of medical practitioners, these APR answer\ncritical just as the PAs are in this day and time. Except for you, Doc. This bill also\nhas one other issue to it. This would allow APRNs and physicians assistance to issue the\nhandicap placards for those people to the Department of Revenue for them to sign off on that\nfor those who are eligible to have a handicap placard. Mr. Speaker, that's pretty well\nwhat it does and I think this would do honor to all of those able-bodied men and women\nacross this state that serve as the nurses and the advanced practice registered nurses\nacross this state.\nI'll be glad to stand for questions and if not, I don't know if you have one question.\nYou care to yield?\nI will yield for one question.\nChair recognizes representative Maynard to your right for a question.\nThank you, Mr. Chair.\nChairman Powell is not sure that physical therapists get a doctorate degree and they\ntoo should be allowed to give persons with disabilities and a handicapped ticket.\nWell, I don't have an opinion on that, but if the latest state so, then it'd be the will\nof the body in here, and God knows what to send it to do.\nMr. Speaker, I would certainly not sure he knows what they'll do either.\nMr. Speaker, I would certainly appreciate your favorable consideration,\nshow honor to those men and women who practice medicine as APR-Ns,\nand I'll be certain to yield the will.\nChair, have another member that wish to be heard.\nChair recognizes Chairman Nicks to speak to the bill.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nI'll be very brief.\nI can't pass up an opportunity to share some love\nwith our nurses as you know my daughter\nis a nurse practitioner.\nAnd I wanted to just point out the people\nwe're talking about here.\nWe're talking about, when we talk about\nthe advanced practice registered nurses,\nwe're talking about certified nurse midwives,\nCertified Nurse Specialist in Psychiatric and Mental Health,\nCertified Registered Nurse Anethasist.\nThese are highly trained and well-qualified people.\nOne thing to think about quite often,\nthe first person that sees someone who's\ncoming into the health care system as a nurse,\nwe need these good people there.\nThey're a critical component of our health care system.\nThey work in a team, as was mentioned earlier, with the doctors.\nI don't know that they keep them from killing people,\nbut they are part of that critical team.\nDr. Newton and I have talked about that a number of times.\nAnd they feel that need that we need.\nThey can be there when the doctor's not there.\nAnd I just wanted to come and say I support that.\nAnd any way that we can encourage and give positive\nrecognition to these very dedicated professionals,\nI really want to do it.\nThey carry a lot of load in that health care system, and I hope that we will continue\nto give them the professional recognition that they deserve.\nAnd Mr. Speaker, with that I'll yield the well, thank you.\nGentlemen, as yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being\nordered?\nThe chair here is not in the previous question is ordered.\nIs there any objection to adopting the committee substitute?\nThe chair here is none.\nThe committee substitute is adopted.\nIs there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable\nto the passage of the bill.\nThe chair here is none.\nThe report of the committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass.\nAll those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye.\nThose opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines.\nHave all members voted?\nHave all members voted?\nIf so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 430.\nThe eyes are 162, the nasor zero.\nThis bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed.\nClerk will read the caption to a group of privileged resolutions.\nHonoring the life and memory of Tamara Natalie Madden.\nHonoring the life and memory of Ernest Clyde Charles.\nin the life and memory of Dr. Arthur Linton,\nA.L.
