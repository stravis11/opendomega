Thank you very much.\n>> Thank you, Senator Watson. I appreciate\nit. Thank you, Mr. President, for the\nopportunity. I'm glad to be able to be\nhere and I'm thankful that my family can\nbe here. I was here a couple of years\nago and uh my wife came along and uh\nit's always good when she comes along.\nShe helps keep me in line and but I'm\nglad that my children can be here today.\nUh my greatest joy outside of Jesus is\nmy family and I thank the Lord for them.\nI think what you all do in this room has\na great impact on families.\nI spoke a couple of years ago in this\nroom on the subject of beginning with\nGod because it all ends with God. Today\nI want to look in the book of Psalms\nwhere the Bible gives us this passage\nchapter 14 or Psalm 14. The Bible says,\n\"The fool hath said in his heart, there\nis no God. They are corrupt. They have\ndone abominable works. There is none\nthat doeth good. The Lord looked down\nfrom heaven upon the children of men to\nsee if there were any that did\nunderstand and seek God.\" The Bible says\nin verse number two of this passage that\nthe Lord looked down from heaven upon\nthe children of men at the conclusion of\nthe verse to see if there were any that\nseek God. I have been pastoring the\nchurch that my dad pastored for 34\nyears. I have been pastoring it for the\nlast 10 years. And there have been many\ntimes throughout the last 10 years that\nI have said to myself, uh, how many\ntimes has my dad looked over heaven and\nseen what I am doing or what we're\ndoing? And I wonder if he's proud. I\nwonder if he recognizes. I wonder if\nhe's able to see. People ask me, do you\nthink they can see what's going on? The\nBible tells us, we're compassed about\nwith so great a cloud of witnesses. Let\nus lay aside the sin that does so easily\nbeset us. Let us run with patience the\nrace that is set before us. And I'm sure\nthere are many in this room that have\nloved ones who have gone on before them\nand they said to themselves, \"I wonder\nif they look over heaven what they see.\"\nMay I encourage you with this thought\nthis morning? There is one that looks\nover heaven and his name is God. The\nBible says he looked down from heaven.\nAnd my question to us this morning is\nwhen God looks down, what does he see?\nWhen the Lord looks into this room, when\nthe Lord looks at the direction of our\nstate, the leadership, uh the agendas\nthat are being promoted, when God looks\ndown, is he pleased?\nIt's easy to look at that corporately\nand say it's important, it's vital. But\nthat begins with us understanding as an\nindividual, we have a responsibility to\nplease God first.\nIn all things, the Bible says, he might\nhave the preeminence. Whenever you begin\nto put pen to paper, whenever you begin\nto stand and address the issues that are\nput forth in this room, may you know\nthis truth that God is looking down.\nThe Bible teaches us that every man will\ngive an account of himself. Every person\nin this room will stand before God with\nthe opportunity that they've been given.\nAnd you have to answer to one. It's not\nthe preacher.\nIt is God.\nHe's looking down today.\nAnd every thought, every action, every\ndeed, every word,\nevery step in our life, we ought to\nconsider God is watching. The Bible\ntells us this, that the eyes of the Lord\nare in every place, beholding the evil\nand the good. God sees it all. I had an\nolder pastor explain to me that verse\none time. He said, you know, when God\nlooks at your life, we we view our life\nby moments.\nBut when God looks at our life, he sees\nit as a picture that is painted on a\ncanvas complete. He sees it the\nbeginning from the end. He sees all the\ndetails. And today, he is watching. He's\nwatching what we do in this room. May\nGod help us to do our best for his\nglory.\nThe greatest thing in my life that I can\ntell you about me is that I as a\n13-year-old boy, I understood that God\nloved me. There's no perfect people in\nthis room.\nAnd God loves imperfect people. And he\nsent a perfect son to die on a cross\nthat we might be redeemed.\nJesus said to those that were confused\nabout where he was going, he said, \"I am\nthe way, the truth, and the life. No man\ncometh unto the father but by me. You\nmust know Jesus as your savior.\nI understood as a 13-year-old boy that\nif I died without Jesus Christ, I had to\nbe separated from him for all eternity.\nBut Jesus made a way. He made a way on a\ncross when he died and shed his blood\nfor your sin and for my sin. And that,\nmy friend, demands that we consider\nhim.\nGod look down from heaven.\nAnd my question to you this morning is\nas he looks, what does he see in this\nplace? I pray I pray that each one of us\nunderstand the responsibility we have\nbefore God.\nAs I close in prayer this morning, I\nwant to say to each of you, our church\nprays for you.\nWe are grateful for the leadership in\nour state. We are grateful for each of\nyour services.\nYour willingness to be a public servant\nis an example, and we're thankful for\nthat.\nI appreciate your willingness to help\nour state be what it should be. Thank\nyou for the opportunity to be here.\nLet's pray together, may we?\nOur Father, I do thank you today for\nyour love, for your grace, and for your\nmercy. I thank you for giving us another\nday of life. I thank you for blessing us\nbeyond what we deserve. Lord, you are\ngood.\nSo Lord, I pray today as we bow our\nheads, I ask for wisdom. I pray that\nyou'd grant every individual in this\nroom the strength and the courage and\nthe wisdom to do what is right. May we\nunderstand, Lord, that you are looking\ndown from heaven and we have a\nresponsibility\nto be pleasing to you. May we allow the\nword of God to guide the principles of\nour life. May the steps of every person\nbe ordered by the Lord in this place.\nMay you protect. May you grant wisdom,\nstrength, and Lord, we say to each\npublic servant this morning, thank you\nfor your willingness to serve. We thank\nyou for our state. Bless it. Grant us\nprosperity and strength. May we be an\nexample to all those around us. And we\nwill give you the glory for it because\nGod, you alone are worthy. We ask this\nin Jesus precious name. Amen.\nGood job.\nWe have a very special guest here today.\nWe have doctor of the day,\nbut the doctor of today is uh has a\nunique tie to this body right here. So,\nuh, I'll let the senator from the 19th\nwho's introducing her today explain that\nto everyone. So, Senator,\n>> thank you, Mr. President. As you know,\nwe have a doctor of the day every\nlegislative session day here, and today\nwe have one back from my district. I've\nmet her once. The uh uh doctor of the\nday is Dr. Ashley Nicole Tillery. She's\nhere today. She's an OBGYn\ndelivering her group delivers around a\nthousand babies down in Videlia, Georgia\neach year. She has clinics in Vidilia\nand in Hazelhurst. She studied at NIH,\nstudied at the Medical College of\nGeorgia, uh was in the partnership at\nthe University of Georgia where she met\nthe love of her life.\nThank you. Thank you. And made her best\ndecision ever at that point in time. Uh\nbut let me tell you about the other\nthings she does, too. She's on the\nlibrary board back in our home county\nbecause she understands that literacy\nmatters. She takes care of our boys all\nday, every day. John and William, 20\nmonths old and four years old. She takes\ncare of Jeremiah who's sitting there in\nthe back while that allows me to be up\nhere and she's more than just a\nphysician. She's someone who cares about\nour community and she's absolute love of\nmy life. So, baby, thank you for being\nour doctor of the day.\n>> All right.\n>> Oh, thank you. Thank you guys so much\nfor having me today. I just want to tell\nall of you, thank you. I know that\ncoming to do this job, you take a lot of\ntime away from your own families, your\ncommunities, and your careers as well.\nSo I certainly appreciate the work that\nyou come um to the capitol to do for all\nGeorgians and because of the work you do\nthe future of medicine in the state of\nGeorgia is incredibly bright. So thank\nyou guys so much.\n>> All right.\nWe have some very special guests here\ntoday and uh glad we're able to\nrecognize these fine ladies here behind\nus.

Mr. President, that completes\nthe order.\nRecognize Senator from the 25th to speak\nto the measure.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nLadies and gentlemen, come before you\nwith uh Senate Bill 146. This bill\ncodifies what cemeteries are and how\nthey're to be treated. Defines what\nabandoned cemeteries are. And it also\nprevents disturbance of cemeteries. And\nuh this is something that u would also\ndefine what an abandoned cemetery is.\nBut it sets out something that's uniform\nthroughout the state for rural counties\nwhere people are trying to set up a\ncemetery on their property. They cannot\nsell these spaces. This would be for a\nfamily only if it was um cemetery spaces\nfor sale. Then they would register under\nthe Secretary of State's office through\nsecurityurities division to form a\nperpetual care cemetery. I ask for your\nfavorable consideration and I'll be glad\nto take any questions if there is any.\nMr. President,\n>> you do have one question, Senator.\nRecognize Senator from the 37th.\n>> Yes, sir.\n>> Does Jim yield?\n>> I do. I I appreciate your short\npresentation. I was um just wanted to\nask just kind of in plain language, if\nyou're if if a church is running a small\ncemetery, what thing what provisions\nthis bill change the status quo of our\nlaw today? That that that was my only\nquestion.\n>> I'm having trouble hearing you. I'm\nsorry. U but I think you're referring to\na church cemetery. This would not affect\na church cemetery unless it became\nabandoned. Okay. And then they would\ngive definition of an abandoned cemetery\nand how it is treated and how it is\nclassified.\n>> But this in no way changes the the the\nrights, responsibilities, duties, legal\nstatus of church cemeteries in any way.\nCorrect.\n>> Right.\n>> Thanks, sir.\n>> Uhhuh. Thank you.\nI ask for your favorable consideration.\nThank you, and I yield away.\n>> Senator has yielded. Does any other\nsenator wish to speak for against the\nmeasure? Chair hears none. Is there\nobjection to the previous question being\nordered? Chair hears none. The previous\nquestion is ordered. Question is on the\nadoption of the committee substitute.

The Senate\nCommittee on Retirement recommends that\nthis bill do pass by substitute by\nSenator Williams of the 25th Chairman.\nMr. President\nCenter from the fourth\nOne second.\nThe Senate Committee on Retirement\noffers the following substitute to\nSenate Bill 150, a bill to be entitled\nan act to amend article 7 of chapter 3\nof Title 47 of the Official Code of\nGeorgia annotated relate to retirement\nallowances, disability benefits, and\nspouses benefits so as to extend the\nprogram to permit public school systems\nto employ certain beneficiaries of the\nteachers retirement system of Georgia as\na classroom teachers in a full-time\ncapacity June 30th, 2034. and for other\npurposes.\nFiscal note has been attached.\n>> Senator Hick.\n>> Thank you, Mr. President.\nI'm here today to present Senate Bill\n150 and it's return to work bill for uh\nfor teachers. Um, this bill will pass\nour Senate Education Committee 100%.\nWhy is this bill important? If we don't\nhave fully prepared certified educators\nin classroom, our students will not\nsucceed.\nI want to read two quotes that really\nbecome profound to me about education\nand teaching.\n>> Hold on one second, Senator. Hold on.\nCould everybody could we have\neverybody's attention while the senators\npresent the bill in the well, please?\n>> Everybody's attention.\nThe quotes are Georgia cannot deliver on\nits commitment to students without a\nstrong teacher workforce.\nThe next one is very profound. Educators\non only workforce whose performance\ndetermines the quality and size of\nfuture workforces.\nI am sure that every senator has\nreceived a phone call or a text from a\nretired teacher or soon to be retired\nteacher concerning this bill.\nThis bill is ex This bill we currently\non a bill that expires House Bill 385\nthat expire June 30th to 26. We worked\nvery diligently and hard with the uh Dr.\nJody Barrow with professional standards\ncommission and um the TRS executive\ndirector retired Buster Evans and now\nJason Branch on this bill.\nYou listened and we reacted. The Senate\nidentified literacy or illiteracy as a\nreal problem in Georgia when we shared\nwith you the percentage of students in\nthird and fifth grade in your Senate\ndistrict that were not reading on grade\nlevel.\nWe heard you. Y'all reacted and we've\ngot numerous bills addressing that per\nper Dr. Jod Jod Barrett, executive\ndirector of Professional Standards\nCommission. Number of classrooms in\nGeorgia that do not have a fully\nprepared\ncertified educator in the classroom. And\nlet me read them all to you. In December\nof 23, there were over 6,000 vacancies\nin Georgia. In December 24, 5,300\nvacancies in Georgia. in December 25,\n5,358\nvacancies. And yes, one of our senators,\nour education committee said, asked me a\nquestion. Could we tell him what\ndistrict that related to or what school\ndistrict? And yes, we can. Professional\nstandards are working on those numbers\nfor me. So, you can tell we've got a\nreal tragedy in Georgia for not having\nnot having fully um certified teachers\nin classroom. Let me give you a personal\nexample that I can I can share with you.\nEvans County, which is one of my\ncounties in my district, classing\nelementary school per Dr. Brad Anderson\non September 1st of 2025.\nThere was six classes\nin K through K through five without a\nfully prepared certified educator in the\nclassroom.\nKindergarten have one class. First grade\nhad one class. Second grade had one\nclass. Third grade had two classes and\nfifth grade had one class. The tragedy\nthat's a tragedy itself because the high\nthe highest degree person in that\nclassroom was a high had a high school\ndiploma. According to Dr. Anderson.\nAs of January 26th, 2026, still at\nClaxton Elementary School in Clon,\nGeorgia, there were three vacancies out\nof those six that had not been filled.\nNow, Senator, let me ask you this.\nHow would you like your child or\ngrandchild\nto be in one of those classrooms that\ndoes not have a fully prepared or\ncertified teacher? Do you think your\nchild or grandchild when they move to\nthe next grade level is going to be\nfully prepared for that? No, they're\nnot. That's the purpose of this bill.\nWe've got to address that problem. And I\ntell you in just a second, this bill's\ngot a sunset in it. And we're working\nvery close with the college and\nuniversities in Georgia to make sure\nthat they're going they are teaching on\nthe science of reading and they're\nteaching our students how to be teachers\nthat teach our students.\nLet me tell you the key provisions of\nthis bill.\nTRS, teacher retirement system in\nGeorgia, tells me now that the average\nperson retires in the school system at\n25 years. Now, that doesn't mean that\nthey get full retirement. They do not.\nAs some of our senators have asked me,\nthey really don't get full retirement\ntill 30 years, but because of wanting to\nget out, maybe maybe raising children or\nsomething like that. Who knows? But the\naverage retirement now is people is at\n25 years. So this this bill a teacher\ncan return to work after teaching 25\nyears and retiring. But now there's a\none-year waiting period. They have to\nstay out of it. Stay out of school for\none year. However, they can come back\nand do that 49% that all of us are aware\nof. Okay? So they will receive their\nretirement and receive the salary for\nteaching in the classroom.\nLet me let me stop there and read to you\nsomething I forgot. But so this this\nletter this email came from of Miss\nRobin Thompson and I don't know where\nshe lives but she said, \"I'm writing to\nexpress my concern my express my strong\nsupport to Georgia Senate Bill 150. As a\nveteran educator, I see firsthand the\nsevere teacher shortage facing Georgia.\nWith more than 5,000 teaching vacancies\nstatewide, districts are struggling to\nstaff classrooms. In my own county,\nschools have been forced to hire\nteachers from other countries to fill\nthe gap. While we value all educators,\nthis has created challenges for students\ndue to language barriers and differences\nin instructional experience, especially\nat the elementary level.\nSo, this bill only applies to the public\nschool system and applies to K through\n12. Let me tell you the courses that\nthat these teachers can come back and\nteach, which is\nvery important ELA, English language\narts, science, social studies, special\neducation, and math. And now we've added\ncareer technical agricultural education,\nCTAE, which the senator from the ETH has\nasked us several questions about and\nvery exciting because his wife is head\nof that in their school system.\n>> Hey, Senator, hold on one second. Ladies\nand gentlemen in the chamber, we're\ngoing to have to bring it down a notch.\nWe can't hear. If you got to have\nconversation, go to the Annie room\nif you're a senator.\n>> So, we need to pay get the attention to\nthe senator in the whale, please.\nBut in order to come back, if they're\nteaching English language arts or an\nacademic content, they've got to have a\ncurrent uh dyslexia\nor reading endorsement or they can\ndemonstrate specific training and skills\nin the science reading and approved by\nthe professional standards commission.\nMany of y'all y'all have asked me what's\nthe cost of this. These teachers are\nreplacing teachers that are no longer\nthere. So there is no cost to the TRS\nsystem. We had actual real study done.\nThere's no cost to it to the system. We\nalso know that if this bill works the\nway that we want it to work and the\ncollege and universities are doing what\nthey need to do, we've got a sunset in\nthis bill of June the 30th of 2034. And\nhopefully by that time we would we would\nhave made a tremendous dent on these on\nhaving teachers in classroom. So by that\ntime we should have solved the teacher\nteacher shortage problem.\nSo senators, I would really I think our\nstudents our students and across rural\nGeorgia would really appreciate you\nvoting for this bill. And um Mr.\nPresident, at that point point in time,\nI'll take any questions. Yes, sir. Yes,\nsir.\n>> You do have a few questions. Senator,\nrecognize the senator from the 33rd for\na question. No question. Recognize\nSenator from the 26 for a question.\nThank.\n>> Oh, that was bad. You You don't have to\ntell me.\n>> Thank you, Mr. President. Gentlemen,\nhere.\n>> Yes, sir. I do.\nAre you telling me\nthat if the school system\nhas a vacancy\nfor a particular teacher\nthat they can't get a retired teacher to\ngo in who's certified\nto teach that class? I thought it had\nsomething to do with TRA.\nThey don't have to school system don't\nhave to pay money into the retirement\nsystem for but they pay them. Are you\ntelling me they can't do that? Now what\nI'm telling you Sandra is that that\nteacher can come back but that teacher\ncomes back at a 49%.\nAnd can so they teach less than halfime\nand as opposed to this bill allows them\nto come back full time.\n>> So you saying they can't come in and be\nhired as fulltime? Sir,\n>> are you saying that they cannot be hired\nas full-time teachers after they retired\nby at in the system?\n>> No, sir. Under the current law, they\ncannot be hired as a full-time teacher.\nThey've got to be hired at 49%.\n>> And that that's what the importance of\nthis bill is. And again, people, this\nthis bill has a sunset provision that if\nwe get it all worked out and y'all\nsupport this bill, that the college and\nuniversities are working very hard. If\nyou recall the Council on Literacy and\nand House Bill 538 brought back the\nscience of reading into the classroom\nand consequently we're working very\nclose with the college university to get\nto make it more attractable and you'll\nsee several more bills in the ne next\nfew days addressing teacher shortage in\nGeorgia.\nYou have a question from Senator from\n19th.\nHe wants to speak at the well.\nSenator from the 21st.\nSenator from the 21st.\nIs this our new senator that's absent\nright now? Senator.\n>> Oh, he's gone.\n>> Yeah. I hope his I hope his town in here\ntoday,\n>> Mr. President, I'm going to yield. Well,\n>> all right. Sounds good.\n>> Thank you, sir.\n>> Thank you.\n>> Senator from 39th. What point? Senator\nfrom the 39th. What purpose do you rise?\nThis is a point in time to do it.\n>> You want to recognize your friends?\n>> Yes. I\nthank you, Mr. President. This is\ncompletely unrelated to SB150, but I\njust wanted to acknowledge a couple of\npeople in the gallery from Jack and Jill\nof America who were here. And that is an\norganization, a mother's organization\nparticularly for black children that was\nstarted in 1938. I am a member of the\norganization myself. the only active\nJack and Jill mom in the entire general\nassembly. And we've got ch lots of young\npeople here who are learning what it\nmeans to have their government work,\nincluding my page, Bryce Blake. Thank\nyou.\n>> Everybody with Jack and Jill, stand up\nand be recognized. Give yourself a round\nof applause. So,\nso very nice to have all those\nwonderful, wonderful young people and\ntheir mentors and thank you Senator for\nrecognizing them. So,\nrecognize Senator from 19 speak to the\nbill.\nWe'll get you We'll get you in a second.\nWe'll get you in a second.\n>> Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the\nSenate, Senate Bill 150, let's talk\nabout it for a second. It allows someone\nto retire after 25 years of service, and\nthey can come back and work full-time.\nThat means if you started working at 22,\nyou're going to be able to retire at 47,\ndraw your retirement at whatever the\nearly number that would be, and then\nstill come back and work full-time. I am\nfocused with you on trying to alleviate\nthe issue we have with not having\nteachers in the classroom. I purport to\nyou though I don't know that this helps\nif it doesn't instead cause a an issue\nwhere we actually lead people to retire\nearlier. And if they do, we need to be\nable to address this in the future. So I\njust want to put a flag on this point.\nI'm I'm willing to walk with you today\nand try this point. But I also want to\nsay that if we come back in two years,\nthree years, four years, and we realize\nthat folks are retiring at 25 and\ncreating and making that situation\nworse, we we need to be willing to\nreadress that. Then the other point I\nwant to bring up is this. We have\nseveral buckets of retirees. Teachers\nfall into TRS. Employees fall into ERS.\nTRS requires a 3% raise on retirement\nevery single year. ERS does not. So when\nwe take and allow another benefit that\nthat is for one program TRS while it may\nbe good naturatured and it may be good\nin the end I want to show you and remind\nyou that we're further causing the wedge\nand divide to develop between our\nemployees who fall into the bucket of\nERS who are not guaranteed that 3% every\nyear on retirement. Well, I'm willing to\ngo with this with you today and I trust\nthat the senator from the fourth and I\nknow he's done a really good job on this\nthis work. If I'm not here in a few\nyears, and you are, I hope we will\nrevisit this and make sure it's having\nthe intended consequence and not further\num causing the divide not only between\nteachers in the classroom but also\nbetween our two systems. Thank you, Mr.\nPresident. I'll yield for questions or\nyield the well.\n>> You do have one question, Senator.\nRecognize Senator from 36.\n>> Thank you, Mr. President. This is\nSenator Yield.\n>> Yes, ma'am.\n>> Um, isn't it true you you mentioned the\nemployee retirement system? We're\ngetting a little feedback on the mic,\nbut you you mentioned, isn't it true,\nthe employee the uh retirement system\nfor the non teaching,\n>> right,\n>> uh state employees and the fact that it\nwas the act of the legislature and the\nI in in removing the 3% cost of living\nfrom a long established practice for\nthose employees. Isn't that true?\n>> It I don't know. I don't think it was\nlegislation that did that, Senator. It\nis legislation that created the 3% raise\nfor TRS though and if it was legislation\nthat removed it, it also would have been\nlegislative that created it. Well, but\nwould you agree if he further you for\nfurther questions that it was it was the\nthe result uh of decisions made uh in\nthe uh in uh the wake of the great\nrecession that state employee retirees\ndo have not gotten a cost of living a 3%\ncost of living in 17 years. You would\nagree with that. Is that right?\n>> That that's not fact. They have received\na cost of living increase, but you are\ncorrect\n>> 3% cost of living was what I expect.\n>> You are correct that they've not\nreceived the cost of living increase\nthat is received in the TRS program,\nwhich is why we may even actually be\nsaying the same thing here. We're that\ndivide becomes worse when we continue to\npivot to one group over the other of\nstate employees.\n>> Uh thank you for the flags you've\nraised. Uh it's it's true, I believe,\nthat we passed this unanimously in our\ncommittee. Isn't that right? Uh I'm not\non that committee, but you may had.\n>> Thank you for uh yielding.\n>> You do have one more question. Senator\nrecognized Senator from the 27th.\n>> Thank you, Mr. President. Chairman, do\nyou yield?\n>> Yes, sir.\n>> Can you walk me through as you\nunderstand the bill? Essentially, are we\ncreating an incentive\nunintentionally here to to allow people\nto retire at 25, year 25, come back at\nyear 27, essentially double dip in the\nsystem? Well, the Senator, we may and\nthat's what I'm highlighting for our\ncolleagues is that I realize we have a\nsituation with shortages in the\nclassroom. So, I'm willing to support\nthis and move forward, but I want\nsomeone to put a flag in it, put a pin\nin it so that we evaluate it in two\nyears, three years, whatever the time\nframe needs to be because if we've not\nclosed that gap, if we've actually\nunintentionally made that gap worse, we\nneed to realize what code section we\nchanged when we did that.\n>> Do you further yield?\n>> Yes, sir. Would it, in your opinion,\nwould it be a good idea for our friend,\nthe bill sponsor, to perhaps uh when\nthis goes to the House to put some\nreporting language in here uh that\nreports back to the future chairman of\nthe House Education Committee so we can\nkeep an eye on that\n>> if if that's needed. I clearly every\nsenator here in this body can bring an\namendment, too. But again, I want to\nhighlight that for our colleagues that\nwe don't want to make this worse and we\nalso don't want to make the divide\nbetween our ERS system and our TRS\nsystem uh more uh the chasm's there\nenough that we need to make it deeper.\n>> You do have one more question, Senator.\nRecognize Senator from 46.\n>> Thank you, Mr. President. Senator,\nyield.\n>> Yes, sir. In your role as appropriations\nchairman, have you given any thought to\nwhat impact this might have on the\nactuarial soundness of the teacher\nretirement system if new teachers begin\nretiring earlier in drawing their\nretirement? Is that something we've\naccounted for or is that a potential\nhole we're about to blow in their\nretirement system?\n>> Well, the there's actually if you look\non the back there's an auditor\ncertification that this does not affect\nthe TRS system as it's drafted right\nnow. My point to you would be let's\nwatch that because we also were told\nthat one tax credit we passed several\nyears ago would cost the state 37\nmillion and it's now costing over 700\nmillion. That's the data center tax\ncredit. So while we have this data that\nwe're working with the best information\nwe have today for those of you in this\nroom who plan to be here longer we need\nto flag this and watch it for the future\njust to make sure we're having the\nintended result.\n>> Thank you Mr. Chairman.\n>> Mr. President, thank you for all the\nquestions. I'll yield the well.\nSenators yielded.\n>> Does any other senator wish to speak for\nagainst measure?\nSenator from the fourth, would you like\nto close or you wave?\nCome on.\nThank you all. Thank y'all for the\nquestions all on on the bill. One thing\nthat\ncame up about the u the cost and all\nevery on finance committee every every\nbill that we have has a fiscal note and\nall we have to go by is what that fiscal\nnote says. And we received a fiscal note\non this bill, Senate Bill 150. And the\nfiscal note said it was no cost, zero\ncost to the TRS system. Now, we can't we\ncan't say 10 years from now what the\ncost is, but but the people that we rely\non for the fiscal notes said there's no\ncost to the TRS system on this. Also,\nthink about this too. If you're in the\nmilitary, and I think some of y'all may\nmay have have, there's different levels\nof retirement in that. So, just don't\nhold it against people just because\nthey're retiring at 25. They're already\nthe average average average retirement\nage of a person in Georgia teaching is\nfor 25 years. Thank you. Please vote yes\non this bill. Vote for our students so\nwe'll have qualified teachers in the\nclassroom teaching our students how to\nread and how to do math and how to\nunderstand social studies and how to\nunderstand the civics system of the\nworld. Thank you. I yield a word.\n>> All right. Senator has yielded.\nDoes any other senator wish to speak for\nagainst the measure? Hold on, Senator.\nI'm I'm gonna get to you. I promise you.\nSenator from the 41st, you have\nsomething on on this topic.\n>> Unanimous consent. I'm ask for unanimous\nconsent to excuse the senator from the\n22nd.\n>> Okay. Without objection, senator from\n22nd excused.\nChair hears none. Is there objection to\nthe previous question being ordered?\nChair hears none. Previous question is\nordered. Questions on the adoption of\nthe committee substitute. Is there\nobjection to the adoption of the\ncommittee substitute? Hearing none, the\ncommittee substitute is adopted. Is\nthere objection to agreeing to the\nreported committee which is favorable to\nthe passes of the bill? The chair hears\nnone. The reported committee is agreed\nto. Is there objections to the main\nquestion being ordered? Chair hears\nnone. The main question is ordered.\nQuestions on the passes of the bill by\nsubstitute. All those in favor vote yay.\nAll oppose? Nay. Secretary unlock the\nmachine.\nOn the pass of the bill, the A's are 48.\nThe N's are one. This bill having\nreceived direct constitutional majority\nis therefore passed by substitute.\nI'm going out of order a little bit, but\nthat's what you do for your hometown\nfolks here. So, uh, behind me I have\nJackson. is today here at the capital we\nhave Jackson Butts County Day and I've\ngot the leadership from the city of\nJackson from city councilman Don Cook to\nMike the county commissioner Mike Wilson\nto Rick you not I'm kidding he\nrepresents him well to to uh\ncommissioner Russ Crumbley our mayor\nCarlos Duffy and then the commissioner\nuh Joe Brown and uh and Brad Brad\nJohnson here is our county manager\nAnd uh and and I just want to tell you,\noh chief, too. I'm sorry, chief. Uh so\nI'm sorry. In fact, our mayor here,\nCarlos, right here, when we were growing\nup, his nickname was Scoot. So I had to\nsay, well, I can't call you Scoot\nanymore. I got to call you the I got to\ncall you Carlos here. So, but uh at any\nrate, this we've got great leadership uh\nat the local level at Jackson and Buds\nCounty there, and they work very well\ntogether. Very proud to be there. I I'm\na sixth generation Buzz County and I\nwill just sh tell you this uh these guys\nright here because of their how how much\nthey've worked together in the very near\nfuture Buds County is going to be the\nfirst and only county that has zero\nhomestead exemption taxes on property.\nZero on property. I don't know I don't\nknow where y'all from, but where I'm\nfrom, everybody's jumping up and down\nabout that. So, uh, but so I want to\nthank them for their leadership. Let's\ngive them a big round of applause here.\nNow recognize senators from 17th. For\nwhat purpose do you rise?\n>> Mr. President,\nI rise today. Point of order, Mr.\nPresident. I rise today to recognize the\ngreat city of Macdonald upon our first\nannual Macdonald day at the Georgia\nState Capitol and we're delighted to\nhave them here in the Georgia State\nSenate. Let's give them a big hand.\nThe city of Mc Thank you. The city at\nMacdonald was founded in 1823\nand named for a naval officer commandor\nThomas Macdonald.\nSince it in incorporation, the city of\nMacdonald has embodied the principles of\nlocal self-governance, civic engagement,\nand responsible stewardship reflecting\nthe determination and vision of the\ncitizens. And the success of the city of\nMacdonald is due in large measure to the\ndedicated service of its mayor, city\ncouncil, past and present, city staff,\nvolunteers, business leaders, and\nengaged residents who have worked\ncollectively to advance the city's\ngrowth and prosperity. And we have them\nwith us today, if you'll raise your\nhand. And standing with me is the\nsenator from the 42nd and the senator\nfrom the 10th.\nUh, and we have with us the mayor, Mayor\nVana, please raise your hand.\nCouncil members Blue, Bert, Thomas,\nPayton, and Reeds. Would you all raise\nyour hand so they can see the wonderful\ncity of Mcdana, Georgia?\nThank you, Mr. President.\nThank you, Senator. And uh good to see\nthe leadership of Mcdana here. Y'all my\nneighbors down in middle Georgia. And uh\nglad to have the new mayor and the city\ncouncil members here as well. So uh\ngreat to have you and uh look forward to\nworking with you guys all. All right.\nThank you, Senator. And this brings me\nto my second point. Always be here for\nthe points of personal privilege.\nAll right. Here we go.\nSecretary, read the caption.\n>> Senate Bill 411 by Senator Still of the\n48th and others. A bill to be entitled\nan act to amend article to amend title\n43 of the official code of Georgia\nannotated relating to professions and\nbusinesses so as to provide for dry\nneedling to be performed by certain\nlicensed individuals. To provide for\ndefinitions to restrict certain\nrepresentations and advertisements\nrelated to the performance of dry\nneedling. To provide for education and\ntraining requirements for occupational\ntherapists to perform dry needling. To\nprovide for disciplinary action. To\nprovide for training requirements for\nacupuncturists. To provide for related\nmatters to provide for an effective date\nto repeal conflicting laws and for other\npurposes.\nMr. President, a Senate Committee on\nHealth and Human Services offers the\nfollowing substitute to Senate Bill 411.\nA bill to be entitled an act to amend\ntitle 43 of the official code of Georgia\nannotated relating to professions and\nbusinesses to to provide for dried\nneedling to be performed by certain\nlicensed professionals to provide for\ndefinitions to restrict certain\nrepresentations advertisements relate to\nthe performance of dried needling and\nfor other purposes. Mr. President, that\ncompletes the order.\nAll right, let's uh uh Mr. Doorkeeper,\nsecure the secure the chamber right now\nexcept for people going out for a second\ncuz it's getting a little loud in here\nand we just have one more bill to go and\nand then we'll be done. But we do need\nto give the senators their due attention\nwhen they're in the whale. So I\nrecognize a senator from the 48th to\nspeak to the measure.\n>> Thank you, Mr. President.\nThis will likely not be the most\ncontroversial bill that we discuss this\nlegislative session, but it is\ncritically important to a small group of\npractitioners\nin the healthc care field, specifically\nthe differences between dry needling and\nacupuncture.\nUh, recently the senator from the 13th\nasked if this was a sticky bill, and I\nwould say uh that in some respects it\ncertainly is. or as the senator from the\n29th said, \"Is this the same as when I\nwas stabbed by an icepick?\" And I would\nsay no. This is not quite the same as\nbeing stabbed by an ice pick. Um\nalthough depending on whether or not uh\nthe current\nMrs. Robertson did that or not is up for\ndebate. Uh but this bill brings PTS and\nOT's on the same page in the act of dry\nneedling. It clarifies language on the\ndifference between dry needling practice\nand acupuncture and traditional Chinese\nmedicine.\nIt allows, if you'll look at the, uh,\nthe green document, the substitute lines\n38 through 40, uh, discusses private\ncause of action that was put in there\nwith the input of some friends that\nwanted to make sure that we had\nclarifying language there. And I believe\nthat this after many many months of\ncompromised language and all these\ndifferent groups and uh being given the\nfinal approval by the George Medical\nAssociation ensures that our physicians,\nour physical therapists, our\noccupational therapists and our\nacupuncturists are all on the same page\nand understand who does what by how much\ntraining and what they have to do. And\nwith that, I'm happy to answer any\nquestions.\nYou do have a couple questions, Senator.\nRecognize Senator from the 41st.\n>> Thank you, Mr. President. Uh, Senator,\ndo you yield?\n>> Absolutely.\n>> Um, I think I heard this correctly, but\nI just want to make sure. Um, last year\nthere were a lot of people who came and\nreally rallied against this bill, were\nvery concerned, um, particularly people\nwho practice from Chinese or um, Eastern\nmedicines. And so, is it true that all\nof that has been resolved and I am not\ngoing to have a whole bunch of angry\nlittle um young folks coming to my\noffice complaining about this? Is that\nnot true?\n>> That is absolutely true, Senator. And\nfurthermore, they were uh integral in\nthe drafting of this legislation.\n>> Thank you so much.\n>> Recognize Senate from the 14th.\n>> Thank you, Mr. President. Senator yield.\n>> Absolutely. Uh, Senator, isn't it true\nthat you've worked hard on the\ndefinition of dry needling to make sure\nthat you exclude Senator questions of\nbill sponsors in the well because I\ndon't want to get a permit.\nUh, I believe uh, Senator that if your\nuh, concern is whether or not the\nmajority of practitioners of acupuncture\nand dry kneeling live in the 48th Senate\nDistrict, you would be correct.

A nonprofit or\nnot for profofit.\nMr. President, that completes the order.\nRecognize Senator from the 46. Speak to\nthe measure.\nThank you, Mr. President, ladies and\ngentlemen of the Senate. Those watching\nat home, this is kind of a peak behind\nthe curtains of what happens a lot of\ntimes on siny die in here. If you look\nin your notebook, you'll see our\noriginal Senate Bill 170 dealt with uh\nhomeless people and how to administer\ngrants and have a count emergency\ncouncil for the homeless. It was a\nbipartisan measure sponsored by the\nsenator from the 41st and then also\nco-sponsored by the senator from the\n29th and the 13th and then finally the\n39th. So you had two Republicans, two\nDemocrats that were trying to create a\ncouncil to help homelessness in the\nstate. Well, that got hijacked a little\nbit on day 40. And by the time it came\nback to us from the house, it had\nnothing to do with homelessness. And\nit's now a bill to establish a grant for\nrural hospitals to have backup\ngenerators if they need them. That's\nkind of how things fly around here. They\ncall it making the sausage there at the\nend. If you're not watching closely,\nthings that have no uh semblance of the\noriginal bill end up being before us for\ndiscussion. This was never vetted in\ncommittee in the Senate and as far as I\nknow not in the House and definitely not\nin the appropriation process,\nbut it is still a good idea and it is\nstill a good bipartisan idea. We had in\nthe first week the senator from the 41st\nmoved to agree with this House\nsubstitute because it's a good program.\nA lot of questions had been raised that\nwe didn't really get to flush out um\nbefore we had to vote that day and it\ndid not pass. It came very close. It had\nbeen raised in our caucus that there\nreally were no hospitals that needed a\nbackup generator.\nAnd we also forgot to mention the\nfederal plan and the big beautiful bill\nuh that created a a fund for rural\nhealth\nthat we applied for grants from that and\nwere awarded them\nthe rural health transportation\nprogram. This is the request for\nproposals that's hundreds of pages\nthick. and our department of community\nhealth then submitted a 64page grant\napplication\nspecifically for rural health and we\ncall our program the great program\nGeorgia's rural enhancement and\ntransformation of health act\nand lo and behold we were awarded over\n$200 million per year for the next five\nyears to direct towards rural health\nwhat my\nMotion to agree as amended with the\nHouse bill just takes this into account.\nIt still applies only to rural hospitals\nwhich are counties of 50,000 or less\nhospitals of less than 100 beds. So\nthese are not large hospitals.\nAnd I simply put in there that this\nwould be grant would be only awarded if\nfederal funds had not been applied for\nand received for the same purpose. Let's\nuse the federal money from the big\nbeautiful bill to pay for these\ngenerators as needed.\nAnd it also limits it to only people\nthat need generators as of the time this\nbill is signed. So this isn't a brand\nnew generator bill for every hospital in\nrural Georgia. It's the ones that need\none that don't get funded through the\nfederal government.\nAnd then if it's coming around now,\namendment 1A, it was brought up to me\nearlier this morning. This is intended\nfor nonprofits or not for-profit\nhospitals, those that are doing good for\nsociety, not that are in the business of\nmaking money. And that's all amendment\n1A does is specify that the only\nappropriate applicants for this grant\nwould be hospitals that are either\nnonprofit or not for profit. And so I\nwould ask for everybody in this body to\nnow join together for this good cause\nand in our bipartisan spirit. And I tip\nmy hat to the senator from the 45th both\n41st both for her original bill on\nhomelessness and her attempt to bring\nthis off the table and let's try to move\nrural health forward in the\ntransformation under the structure that\nwe have. Uh Mr. President, with that\nI'll yield the well, but I'm happy to\nyield for any questions if there are\nany. You you do have one question,\nSenator. Recognize the senator from the\n55th.\n>> Will the distinguished gentleman yield?\n>> Be glad to yield to you, Senator.\n>> Yes. On amendment one, uh it says\nwith respect to a hospital have not\nreceived any federal assistance. Did you\nmean to have it that they have not\nreceived the federal assistance or they\nhave not applied for that federal\nassistance?\n>> I just meant that they had not received\nit. We don't want to double dip, so to\nspeak, and it goes on to say federal\nassistance for the purpose of acquiring\nor installing a backup generator. So, if\nthey've already received it, then let's\ndon't issue a state grant for it as\nwell.\n>> And and it with gentleman of the year,\n>> be glad to. Is it not true that I am so\nproud of this body addressing at least\ntrying to address homelessness as we\nhave to drive past people under bridges\nevery single day even to come to this uh\nillustrious magnificent building.\n>> That is true and I I do hope that our\nbody will address that through some\nother legislation this year that's more\ngermanine to the subject matter.\n>> Thank you sir.\n>> Thank you.\nRecognize Senator from the 41st. Thank\nyou, Mr. President. Senator, do you\nyield?\n>> Happy to yield to you, Senator.\n>> Isn't it true that I have great\ngratitude to you for picking up this\nbill to make sure that rural hospitals\ncan get the things they need?\n>> Yes. And uh it's two-way street there,\nSenator. I have much respect and\ngratitude for your efforts in this. And\nuh I tip my hat. I should have asked you\nto co-sign this amendment because you\ngot the ball rolling and I wouldn't have\nbeen smart enough to bring this up\nwithout your uh initiative, your push\nalong the way. Thank you.\nYou have no further questions, Senator.\n>> Thank you. I yield the well.\n>> Does any other senator wish to speak for\nagainst measure?\nThe question is on the adoption of\namendment 1A and one. We're going to\ntake up amendment 1A first.\nauthored by the senator from the the\nfirst year. Uh is there objection?\nAmendment 1A\nwithout objection amendment 1A\nis adopted. Now the question is on\namendment one\nwhich is the underlining amendment and\nwe're going to put that one on the board\nto be voted on. So\non amendment one all those in favor of\namendment one will vote yay. All oppose\nnay. Secretary and light the machine.\non the motion to agree as amended. The\nyays are 50, the nays are zero,\nand this\nis passed.\nrecognize the good doctor from the\ncoast,\nsenator from the first.\n>> Thank you, Mr. President. Uh, persuant\nto Senate rule 7-1-10B.\nI give notice that on the next\nlegislative day, I intend to move that\nthe Senate consider House action on\nHouse Bill 54.\n>> Senators move to give notice. Secretary\nread the caption.\nHouse Bill 54 by Representatives Clark\nof the 100th.

Mr.\nPresident, that completes the order.\n>> Thank you for the notice, Senator.\nRecognize Senator from the 31st, the\nmajority leader.\n>> Mr. President, I move the Senate stand\nadjourn until 10 a.m. on Tuesday,\nFebruary 10th.\n>> Senator has moved.
