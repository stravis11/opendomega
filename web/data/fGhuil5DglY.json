  "transcript": "Good morning everyone, good to have everyone here today. I think I want to thank the members\nof the media who are attendance today. I also want to thank members of the business community\nthat are here today. We have a representation from the Georgia Chamber as well as the Atlanta\nMetro Chamber and the NFIB and the Americans for Prosperity is here as well. I also like\nto thank our members of the Senate, both a majority leader, Gooch and leadership leader\nDugan and Dolezal, Walker, Strickland, Payne and Hustettler, and cannot forget Mr. Beech\nas well.\nSo, one of my favorites, but today we are here to highlight some initiatives that we're\ngoing to have as a Senate, this upcoming legislative session, for years I've always talked\nabout during the second, in my times in the Senate, during the second portion of a biennial,\nwe ought to be looking at ways to help businesses reduce burdens in regulations and eliminate\nas much red tape as possible through the legislative process.\nAnd that's why I'm excited that our Senate members for the majority caucus are very\nengaged and energetic about doing that.\nupcoming legislature session, we are proud to, we're going to call it the red tape rollback\nand it is going to be a champion of small businesses by trying to eliminate unneeded, like\nI said, burdens of red tape and bureaucratic hurdles that a lot of small businesses have\nto undertake in order to get either expand or either get started in communities around\nthe state, so we want to be, we want to be, to take on that initiative and be the ones\nto lead the charge on being the small business friendly state.\nAnd one of those pieces of legislation is Senate Bill 157 that our good friend, Senator\nStrickland, authored last year, which actually passed the Senate unanimously 55-0.\nHe would think something so overwhelmingly popular in the Senate would have no problem\nin the House.\nBut unfortunately it was held up a little bit and I wanted to call on Senator Strickland\nand then after that call on Senator Larry Walker who's going to talk about some of the work\nthat he had done during the offseason to address these issues that I think are important\nto small businesses, important to Georgians, families and I think they won't make a lot\nbig headlines but they will be very beneficial to small and businesses around our\nstate. So Senator Strickland. Good morning. Great to be with you all this\nmorning. Thank you Lieutenant Governor Jones and members of the my caucus\nhere with us and some of our friends in the business community as well. As\nLieutenant Governor Jones mentioned one of our great initiatives this past\nsession we continue to work on and the outcome in 24 session is Senate Bill 157.\nAs he mentioned, everybody standing up here, either supported that bill or voted for that\nbill.\nWhen it passed the Senate last year, now we look to getting this bill done in the house\nand it is consistent with the initiative being highlighted today by Lieutenant Governor\nJones.\nSenate Bill 157 reduces barriers to employment, specifically for those who have criminal\nrecords in our state.\nWith all the Georgians we have 4.5 million of us have something on our record, some sort\nof criminal record in our state.\nAnd while we've worked to reform our criminal justice system over the past decade, we still\nhave barriers in place that prevent these individuals that have proven they're ready to move\npast, mistakes they've made in the past and enter their workforce.\nOne in seven jobs at the same time in our state, we call it Occupational License.\nthat are looking to move past our criminal justice system and our workforce as productive\nmembers of the society are finding a system so complicated that may choose not to even\ntry to navigate it.\nSenate Bill 157 creates a uniform process for how criminal records are considered by licensing\nboards, making certain that only those past offenses that directly relate to the field\nof employment and the safety of the public are used against an applicant.\nIt also streamlines the appeal process for those that are not a license to make sure they\ncan actually navigate the system without having a skilled attorney, nothing against skilled\nattorneys that can be very expensive.\nFinally, Senate Bill 157 provides a way for those with criminal records to learn exactly\nhow pass offenses will impact their ability to work prior to making an investment in getting\ntrained to work in a particular area.\nBoards will start publishing online.\noffenses that disqualify someone from working in certain industries.\nAnd also individuals can now go with this bill through a pre-approval process and learn\nhow their past offenses will impact their ability to work in certain areas before they pay\nfor training.\nThere are a lot of statistics that we hear about what makes someone more likely to reoffend\nafter committing a crime.\nAnd what factors increase the likelihood that someone will spend his or her life in and\nout of our criminal justice system.\nWith all these factors, though, the ability to work, to gain a skill, and\nsupport of family is one of the most obvious things that can allow someone to become a productive member of society.\nWith Senate Bill 157 becomes law, it will directly help individuals stop the cycle of entering the criminal justice system for providing employment opportunities that will lead to generational change for our families in our state.\nWe will also directly address the workforce needs for employers in our state, rate of\nhigher workers and high demand areas.\nWith small businesses around the state struggling to find employees, and with a continued need\nto give a hand up to individuals that are ready to leave our criminal justice system behind\nand become tax paying citizens.\nThe passage of Senate Bill 157 is critical.\nI look forward to working with my colleagues in the House to get this bill out this next\nsession on to the desk of Governor Kim.\nAnd so with that, speaking of occupational licensing,\nI'm going to turn it over to our chairman of our industry,\nwho actually is called our insurance and labor committee,\nand the Senate who's also chairing a committee\nI'm serving on this session, a study committee\nto look at occupational licensing in our state.\nSo I'll turn it over to my friend, Larry Walker.\nThank you for giving me your name.\nWell, good morning.\nGood to be with you all this morning.\nI certainly appreciate Senator Strickland's work\non that important piece of legislation.\nAnd I'm confident we're going to get that pass\nin the 24 session.\nThe lieutenant governor is a, he likes to say a small business\nowner.\nI'll just say a business owner, himself,\nand he understands better than anybody.\nThe problems we have with over regulation and bureaucracy\nand red tape.\nSo I'm proud to play a small role in trying to make Georgia a better place to work and\ngive people the right to work without having to pay the state a tax basically to do that.\nAnd I appreciate Lieutenant Governor's support in this endeavor and I look forward to what\nwe're going to be able to accomplish.\nI recently attended an announcement.\nof you were there, where we, for the 10th consecutive year in the road, announced that site selection\nmagazine named Georgia, the number one place in the nation to do business. We're very, very\nproud of that, and that's because we've had great governors and great lieutenant governors\nand great conservative leadership for the last decade, and I'm particularly proud that we're\nseeing a lot of economic growth in rural parts of the state, but because of all this economic\ndevelopment success and the pro-business environment that we have here in Georgia, we are facing\na lot of workforce shortages. I hear that everywhere I go no matter what industry speak\nto as challenges with workforce, and this challenge is going to impede our economic growth\nif we don't address some of the barriers to that and it's going to impact our public welfare.\nThe burdensome licensing requirements that we have in this state contributed to this\nworkforce shortage and also impede entrepreneurship and upward mobility for our citizens.\nI introduced and with the Lieutenant Governor's support past Senate Resolution 85, which is\na study committee on occupational licensing and the lieutenant governor appointed this\nbipartisan committee and we've been working diligently in the interim on this issue and\nI want to recognize the members of the committee senator Jason out of a tardy senator Mike\nDougan who's here with us senator Sonja Halper and senator Brian Strickland and myself\nthat chairs it. According to the Institute for Justice, Georgia ranks 12th in the nation\nfor burdensome licensing requirements. This disproportionately impacts lower income\nprofessions and drives up consumer cost. Research has shown that licensing impediments\nmay result in 3 million fewer jobs nationwide. And most empirical evidence does not find that\nstricter licensing requirements improve quality, public safety, or health. In Georgia we have\nover 40 licenses under the Secretary of State's Professional Licensing Board Administration.\nAnd our study committee has been working hard to see where we can reduce the licensing burden\non hard work in Georgians and protect our citizens' freedom to work.\nWe're looking through the lens that our state constitution protects the right to work\nin one's chosen profession free from unreasonable government interference.\nOur constitution tells us that as Georgians, we've got the right to work without the government\nintervening and that's been upheld recently by a Georgia spring court ruling so the government\nhas to have a compelling reason to require a license and it has to be surrounding public\nsafety or consumer protection. And if the license does not involve those or does not arise\nto the level that confelling reason, we shouldn't have it. And that's the lens we're looking\nat all of these licenses. So we're reviewing the licensing that we have, the existing\nand any proposed new licensing to see if it meets that standard.\nWe're looking at a potential of repealing licenses that don't meet that standard, and\nthe licenses that do meet that standard, we're looking at trying to pair back the cost\nand the hurdles of entry into that, the cost and dollars for training and schooling and\ntesting and all of that and the cost in time and we are also looking at trying to go to\na more universal recognition of licenses. We've got a lot of people moving to Georgia because\nwe are a pro-business and we're a great place to live work and raise a family. So we want\nto recognize folks that are licensed and doing similar things in other states and not require\nthem to start back over from scratch. And this includes our military, people exiting\nthe military and military spouses. And another aspect we're looking at is some of our\nlicensing boards are really woefully under resourced, particularly I think the nursing board.\nSo we want to look at where we need to allocate more resources to get. We have a huge healthcare\nwork for shortage. And part of it is, is it so cumbersome to try to get licensed as a nurse.\nSome small examples and again we've got one more meeting and we haven't finalized our\nrecommendations and our report. So I don't want to get ahead of myself too much but some examples are\nmakeup artists, a makeup professional working in a retail environment is not required to have a\nlicense. If they're working on a film set, they're not required to have a license. But\nif they're working just, if they wanted to open their own business and be a makeup artist\nfor the general public, they are required to get a cosmetology license. So that really\ndoesn't make sense to me. We have some licenses that no other, very few other states have,\nlike low voltage, low voltage electrical contractors. I don't know that that makes sense.\nI'm not sure why a librarian needs to be licensed, frankly.\nMaybe there is a compelling public safety reason, but I haven't heard it.\nMusic therapist, it's another example.\nAnd then finally, I want to speak to the calls I get, the constituent service calls I get,\noverwhelming majority really are related to licensing in all different fields.\nAnd so it's a problem no matter what industry you're in.\nBut I get a lot of calls from APRians, advanced registered nurses that have to get a license\nthrough the State Nursing Board, but they have to get their protocol agreement approved\nby the Composite Medical Board.\nAnd it is, I've heard of cases where it's taken over a year to get those protocol agreements\napproved.\nSo my idea is that they submit their protocol agreement to the Composite Medical Board\nfor them to have on file and it's deemed approved and they can go to work.\nThat's just some examples of the kind of stuff we're working on and again, I appreciate\nthe Lieutenant Governor supporting this endeavor and as a business owner he understands\nthat he gets it and I'm confident with his backing that we're going to make some good\nheadway on this issue.\nThank you very much and I'll turn it back over to Lieutenant Governor.\nThank you, Senator Walker and thank you, Senator Strickland, appreciate that and like\nLike I said, these are issues I think that need addressing, that are important to the\nindividuals who affect every day, businesses and small entrepreneurs.\nIt might not grab a lot of headlines, but I can assure you it's meaningful, especially\nto the people that it's costing them time and money because they are unable to get their\ninability to get proper licensing or permits and things of that nature.\nSo this will conclude our press conference today.\nYeah, I know, Raul, you got a question, I believe.\nI was wondering, one of the questions I had is,\nsee that the more certain plus that you guys are going\ninto this sector, is there a goal in using that,\nwhether it is the licensing force, the nursing force?\nRight.\nBecause we've got the more certain plus the work.\nYeah, we do have a large surplus and we're very fortunate,\nand it goes to, you know, how fiscally responsible\nbeen as a state as a legislative body and as well as our governor. Obviously he's led the charge\non allowing us to have such a good surplus to work with. The whole legislative process\nare one constitutional obligation is the balance of budget and and figure out what is the best use\nfor dollars. Both you know the regular appropriation money but also the surplus that we'll have as well.\nSo all those things will be discussed and we'll tackle some of those issues and you're right\nThere are some agencies that could probably\nThat need a little more help from a personnel standpoint\nThe surplus money might be a might be a good means to get there\nYou know, we'll look at all of them\nYes, sir\nand in broadening the definition of small business under the administrative\nC-directed businesses as 300 employees.\nCan you or somebody talk about that?\nWell, you know, I mean, obviously, you know, small businesses right now that are, I\nguess, the definition on file is that it represents 100 employees.\nI tend to look at it differently.\nI'm objective on how I look at small businesses.\nSome people think it's ten or under, some people think it's a thousand or under, you know, but this right here\nwill allow perming processes to be done at a faster pace, at some agencies, by putting them in this category of 300 or less.\nSo, any other questions? Yes, sir?\nLooking at the more globalized level of municipalities and counties\nare allowed to be understated law. There's a really small business\nand we're allowed to see this one. Sure.\nOne person who companies are under the business is\nand global jurisdictions are allowed to put regulations in the business license\ndepartment. That's definitely something that we've looked at before in the past.\nI know Senator Dugan was being in the contractor himself.\nThat's the great thing about having a citizen-legislative body.\nbody is a lot of people are involved in our day-to-day businesses or something\noutside of this chamber or this building here which gives us a unique\nperspective on things and I will say that yeah we've looked at looked at\nbecause a lot of the times the things that contractors run into or small\nbusinesses or whatever run into is the process the slow process it can take at\nthe local level so whatever we can do to try to alleviate some of those burdens\nwe're going to look at those two, so all right. Thank you all very much. Appreciate you all being here.\n",
