  "transcript": "you Good morning. The time for convening has arrived. Senate will come to order. Good morning, Mr. President. Happy crossover day to you. Glad you're here. I missed you.

From Hotsdon, we have Noah Tindall. And from Atlanta, we have Liam Mitchell. Y'all give these pages a big round of applause. We appreciate y'all being here to help us do the people's business here in the Georgia State Senate. We've got a long day and a lot of bills, so look forward to working with you. Mr. President, the journal has been read and found to be correct. All right, thank you, Senator. Are there any motions to reconsider, recognize the Senator from the 26th? Mr. Governor, I so move. You move. I move the recon center. You need to state your position, Senator. Mr. Governor, I move that we reconsidered the Senate bill 4. The Senator from the 26th says move that we reconsider Senate bill 4 from Secretary of the CAHPSHA. Senate bill 4 by Senator Dolezell on the 27th and others have been tied to amend chapter 2. Title 20, the official code of Georgia annotated. We'll do elementary and secondary education. So the revised provisions are going to fundamental roles of local boards of education and local school superintendents to provide for requirements for the mode. Model code of ethics for local boards of education to be promulgated by the state board of education to provide for public complaints alleging ethics code violations by members of local boards of education to provide for required and prohibited topics and training programs for local board of education members to provide for a sanction. For noncompliance to provide for an effective date to provide for later matters to be able to look at laws and for other purposes. Mr. President, that completes the order. Senator from the 40th, for the purpose of the purpose of the U.S. Ashen and Mr. Consent to excuse the senators from the 49th and the 50th for business outside the chamber. Senator from the 49th and the 50th without it, Jackson will be its excuse. Now I recognize Senator from the 26th to speak to his motion. Thank you, Governor. Ladies and gentlemen, I hate to oppose my warm, close and trusted friend. But let me say something to you about this bill. I know you voted on it and you have no other idea what it does. By law, every superintendent and board members have to get trained. This excludes those in order for those who are new. If you elect a superintendent or you appoint a superintendent, you do it to make sure he manages the school system. Under this bill, you will have board members trying to micro-manage. Now my problem with you is to tell me some long time ago, boy you're meddling. This is meddling. When you go back home, you can't explain to your school board members. You didn't know what this bill did. It basically tells them that they cannot come here and see us who make the law. If they got a problem, board members are superintendents. Now it says training. But you're going to go and train and say you can't go up and see them legislator. Well ladies and gentlemen, we are the seat of power. And when they have a problem, they come see us about it. And that's how we find out about it. But make sure you know that you pass this bill when your board members come to you and your superintendent and you tell them, well, I didn't know that. Well, I'm telling you what it does. It's meddling. And I'm going to tell you something else. This is a good way to get an exit after the Georgia Senate. Thank you. Thank you Senator. Senator from 27th, since it's your bill, he's made the motion for a while, so we would like to speak to it. Thank you, Mr. President and colleagues. The words on the page matter. Not the words that are spoken in a well, but the words on a page. And the words that are on the page of the bill that we voted to pass is, quote, that it shall be the duty of the local board to hold the school superintendent accountable in the performance of his or her duties. That's what the bill says. The bill doesn't say that the school board needs a medal. That's one piece of the bill. So that's just, I think, an honest misunderstanding by the senator for what the bill does. As to the lobbying portion. There's nothing in the bill that says the school board members cannot come to the general assembly. There's nothing in the bill that says that they can't have breakfast with their local delegation. This gets down to the training that happens. The mandated training in what these school board members can be taught. Because here's what's happening today without these guardrails. The board members get elected. They are then forced into compulsory education every single year. They are the only elected officials that have to be trained every single year. There is no other elected official that has to be trained every single year other than board of education members. And in some cases, not all, but in some cases, that training goes something along the lines of this. You're not the expert. Your superintendent is. Go sit in the corner and be a house plant. Do whatever they tell you to do. Vote unanimously. Never disagree with each other in public. The you all being in public is the board. So they are encouraged to have all five votes. They are encouraged to never ask questions about the budget. And all that this bill does is as if they cannot be trained. To go sit in a corner and be a house plant. They can also not be instructed that a key component of their job is to lobby the general assembly. This is the key word here. I was a recommendation from the center from the 38th that we changed in the bill on specific matters. They can be told that part of being a good board of education member is to communicate with the general assembly. Part of being a good board of education member is to go meet with your local delegation. So I respect my friend. I'm happy to answer any questions off line. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So the question now is on the motion to reconsider. Put forward by the center from the 26th. And it's on Senate bill four. That's a bill that we took up. Tuesday. All right. So the motion for reconsideration. All those in favor of the motion for reconsideration will vote. Yay. All those opposed will vote. Nay. Secretary and Lentner machine. Senator from the 37th. Thank you. All the motion. All the motion. All the motion. All the motion. Senator. Senator. Senator. Senator. Senator. Senator. Senator. Senator. Senator. Senator. Senator. Senator. Senator. Senator. Senator. Senator. Senator. Senator. Senator. Senator. Senator. Senator. Senator. Senator. Senator. Senator. Senator. Senator. It is now time for the morning roll call. Are there any motion to excuse? I asked for unanimous consent to excuse the senator from the 42nd. Any other motion to excuse? Any other motion to excuse? Any other motion to excuse? Any other motion to excuse? Any other motion to excuse? Any other motion to excuse? Any other motion to excuse? Any other motion to excuse? and the same is one nation under God, and it is will deliver to you in justice for all. And now the Georgia flag, a pledge allegiance to the Georgia flag, the French local religious stance, with them justice, moderation, and courage. Friends, colleagues, it gives me great pleasure to have the pastor of the day Reverend Matt Sap, who is the pastor of Central Baptist Church in my hometown of Newton, Georgia. And before serving at Central Matt, serve churches in both Canton and Atlanta, he's a graduate of Mercer University as well as Mercer's Macphee School of Theology. In addition to his work at Central Baptist, he also serves on the Board of Trustees at Mercer University, on the Board of Visitors for the Macphee School of Theology, and as the moderator for the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship of Georgia. Matt's wife Julie, who actually is on a trip this week, couldn't be with us, but Julie is a native of Wainsburg, Georgia, and is also a graduate of Mercer University. Matt and Julie have two sons, Hudson and Joey, and a daughter, Mary Jane. And many of y'all know that I go home every single night, and one of the reasons I do go home every single night, so I can get up the next morning, I can take my children to school. And when I take my kids to school, now I drive. I drive my kids to school. It's two blocks a long way from me. But when every single morning, when I'm taking my kids, I look, and then there's Pastor Sap walking up the street with his children dropping them off at the same school. And I can always just see the joy in his face. I know he enjoys doing that. And it really, to me, gives me joy to see him not just being a pastor to our community, but also being a loving father to those dear children. And I know he'll tell you that that walk is uphill both ways in the snow and it's a tough walk. So Elm Street can be treacherous. But without further ado, I give you my friend Ann neighbor, Reverend Matt Sap. Mr. President, thank you. Senator brass, thank you for that introduction, and for the invitation to be here today. Matt and I do live in the same neighborhood. Our kids do go to the same school. Most mornings we do pass each other on those mean streets of Elm Street in New Ninja, Georgia, as you described them to and from dropping our children off at elementary school. Representative Lynn Smith, by the way, also lives in our neighborhood. Not the privilege of being her pastor. So the Sap family is well represented here at the state legislature. And we love being from New Ninja. We like to think that we're from, Matt, you'll agree with us, I think, the greatest town and the greatest state in the greatest country in the history of the world. And down in New Ninja, we work pretty hard to keep it that way. Senator brass and his family are committed members at a church just down the street from ours, but I always like to tell Matt there's always room for him and his family at Central Baptist Church too. So for those of you who follow the Christian calendar yesterday was Ash Wednesday. That makes today the second day of Lent. For the next 46 days, just over six weeks, which is more than 10% of the year, by the way. Those of us in Christian traditions that observe Lent will use this season of the year to prepare for Easter through an intentional focus on things like prayer and fasting. When you hear someone say they're giving up Instagram for Lent, for example, that's a kind of fasting. And for those of us who observe Lent, we will spend 12% of our lives this way, 46 days, year after year. That's 40 days of Lent and fasting, six Sunday feast days scattered in between. We always feast on Sundays, but 12% of our lives, and eventually if you're old enough and faithful enough, 20 Lents go by. I think this is about the 20th Lent I've observed in my adult life. And you're left to wonder, giving 12% of your life over to this kind of observance, if you're really making any spiritual progress at all, or if you're just living the same year over and over again, each Lent. As the weather starts to warm up, we'll start to get into the heart of blue crab season down along the Golden Isles. St. Simon's, Jeacle, Cumberland Island, my wife's actually on her way down to that part of our state right now. Maybe we've got a senator in the room who represents that area of our state. I grew up in Virginia around the Chesapeake Bay. Blue crabs were the source of crab cakes all summer long, and Richmond, Virginia where I grew up and soft shell crab was a delicacy. Blue crabs can molt as many as 20 times during their lives, shedding their hardened outer shell to make room for a new, more fitting shell to take its place as the crabs grow. And as they get larger, shedding their shells, getting rid of that accumulated outer layer can be a painful process for crabs. It is for sure a vulnerable process, but they cannot grow without it. Lent each year for us is kind of like that. It's like shedding our hardened outer layer to make room for us to grow. Imagine how uncomfortable it must be to be stuck inside a shell that's grown too small, and how stunting it can be to your growth. Most of us don't have to imagine year after year, season after season, lent after lent, we refuse to shed the shells we've outgrown because it can be a painful process. It is hard to shed and leave behind the thoughts, the beliefs, the attitudes, the behaviors, even the relationships that we've outgrown, and it for sure can leave us feeling vulnerable, but we cannot grow without it. For a blue crab, the process of shedding that outer layer to make room for new growth begins with a hairline crack along the length of its back. For those of us who observe lent, that process began yesterday with ashes placed in the shape of a cross on our foreheads, as we begin to shed the things that have grown too small for us. The crab, by the way, never gives the old shell a second thought, it just sheds what it has outgrown and moves on, and that way the crabs may be are more evolved than we are. But just like the blue crab, our growth is an iterative process. We have to be willing to shed our shells over and over again. That's why Christians observe lent every year, 12% of our lives. Somewhere along the way, we got the idea that we could demonstrate our strength by all the things we carry on the day after Ash Wednesday. We remember with the blue crab that we grow by what we leave behind. Let's say a prayer together. Heavenly Father, bless the men and women in this room and bless the work they do together. Give them the wisdom to carry out their work in a way that best serves the people of our state and in a way that best honors you. We offer our prayer in Jesus' name. Amen.\n\nyou you you you you you you you you you How do I want in We'd like to thank you for everybody to go but make sure you put your name in the park so we can make sure we have all the equipment we need but it's March 11th Sign up All right, thank you senator Sonner from the 15th I Thank you, Mr President I rise this morning to recognize a special group of friends to me On Saturday we will commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the ninth Marine Expeditioning Brigade's landing at the Nang Vietnam on March 8th 1965 These brave Marines were the first major U.S. combat unit to fight on the ground in Vietnam marking the transition from an advisor role to direct combat the arrival The courage and resilience of these Marines paved the way for thousands who followed the on wavering commitment to duty embodied the Marine Corps Model simple fidelis always faithful these Marines face not only the harshest combat condition But also the uncertainty of what was to come they were the first to take a stand in this land sitting the stage for Psychophyses that were to follow throughout the struggle they remain steadfast the 9th Me be was pivotal in the early years of the war and their role in establishing the Military strategy in the region for years to come they are the true definition of American heroes Today I would like to honor some of the men who served alongside me heroes who sacrificed defended our nation Willie Jowls Montgomery Alabama Cleveland Whitehead Atlanta a formal police officer here last Jenkins Atlanta Steve Peppie California Terry Houghton who served from Canada who just deceased Henry Stiltman Tony Stiltman was a sergeant who commanded me in Vietnam.

Article 11, chapter 2, title 20, and Article 10 of chapter 3, title 38. The official court of Georgia annotated relates to public school property and facilities in state. Why first responder building mapping information system, respectively, so as to enact Ricky and Alyssa's law, to require local school system to implement a mobile panic alert system capable of connecting desperate emergency services, technologies to ensure real time coordination between the multiple state and local first responder agencies in the event of a school security. To authorize the Georgia emergency management and the Homeland Security Agency to adopt rules and regulations for the requirements for school mapping data to arrive for definitions, arrive for related matters, arrive for effective data to be able to look at laws and further purposes. Mr. President, Senate, on education and youth, recommends this bill to pass by a substitute, respect what's minted, Senator Hickman, chairman. Mr. President, the Senate, comment on education, youth, overstu long substitute to Senate bill 17, it builds maintenance to amend Article 11, chapter 2, title 20, and Article 10 of chapter 3, title 38. The official court of Georgia annotated relates to public school property and facilities and state why first responder building mapping information system, respectively, so as to enact Ricky and Alyssa's law and further purposes. Mr. President, I can please the order. Bring it as the Senator from 31st, speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. President. On the morning of September 4th, lives were changed forever at Appalachia High School in Barrow County, Georgia. On that day, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said at 10.20 AM, the Barrow County Sheriff's Office received the alerts about reports of an active shooter. The victims were identified by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation on that day as student Christian and Duke Glow, student Mason Schemmerhorn, teacher Christina Iramy, and teacher Richard Ricky Ashmol. That day changed Georgia forever, and I know on behalf of my family, your families, this entire Senate body, we think about those four individuals every day, we think about the students, the teachers in that building, and what they experience, and we think about the Barrow County community in general. To this day, I know Shane Ashmol, some of y'all met her, she testified, and the Senator from the Forest Committee about this bill and the lasting impact that's had on response, and it responses to an active shooter or a health emergency on a school campus. Very similar to what Alyssa Aldehef's mom and family experienced on February 14th of 2018 during the Marjorie Stoom and Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, where this bill that you voted on last year with bipartisan support was born, unfortunately. This bill basically is to improve public safety response times to life-threatening emergencies, and this bill requires that public schools provide classrooms with a mobile panic alarm technology to basically save lives, reduce the amount of time that it takes for law enforcement to respond, and get to an incident. The other part of this bill is a school mapping piece, and very simply, all it does is require that every school property in the state be mapped. So, that data is provided when an incident happens in real time. Our folks and friends in the public safety community know where to go to find the assailant, where to go save lives, where to evacuate people, seconds count, minutes count, nothing will ever change what happened in Parkland or Barrow County, but I think we all agree we can make our systems better, our schools better, and make sure that our schools are as safe as a humanly possibly can be. I do want to recognize the president of the Senate for his work on this and his support, the senator from the 46th, the senator from the 45th, and the senator from the 49th and others, those senators that represent the Barrow County community for walking alongside a lot of these families who still have questions about what happened in that school that day. And I do want to thank the Georgia Emergency Management Agency, their entire team, Chris Stallings, who has moved on to other things now. The Barrow County Sheriff's Office, Governor Kemp and many others who showed up that day and that night after an event that changed our entire world. So with that Mr. President, I'll yield, there's a couple questions, otherwise I'll yield the will. You have no question, Senator. Name is President, I ask for a green vote. Does any other senator wish to speak for against a measure? Chair, has there the obvious question being ordered? Chair, is it on the CDM? Is there an adopted committee that is adopted? Yes, it's scars and all internal concerns. The injured committee is adopted. The board of the committee has agreed to. It has their objectives to the main question being ordered. Chair here is none of the main questions. Ordered questions on the passes of the bill. All those in favor of vote, yay, all opposed, nay, secretary, and all on the machine. Thank you. All on the passes of the bill, the yay's are 55, the days are zero. This bill has received direct constitution majority. Therefore pass by substitute. Good job senator from the 31st. Those are bills. I know you worked very hard on those first two bills. Good work on those two. Secretary Reed, Senate bill 61. Senate bill 61 by Senator Dullesall, 27 with another. It's bill 19 to men. Article 6 or chapter 11, title 15 of the CGA. We're ready to deliver these. I ask to provide for additional offenses over which superior courts are authorized to use exclusive original jurisdiction for the trials of children in 13 to 17 years of age to include the offenses of certain terrorist, sexual threats, or acts involving public and private schools. An attempt or criminal conspiracy to commit certain offenses to arrive for which such cases shall be subject to the class a designated felony act provisions of code section 15-11-602. I'm on transfer to a juvenile court to amend chapter 2 of the title 20, those to GA. I want to do elementary and secondary education to repeal the flicking laws on further purposes. Mr. President, Senate committee on judiciary recommends this bill to pass by substitute or slightly submitted to the Strickland chairman. Mr. President, the Senate committee on judiciary offers the following substitute to Senate bill 61, a bill to maintain an act to amend. Article 6, we've chapter 11, title 15 of the Fisher-Gurah Georgia annotated. We'll be due to the link we'll see. It's just to provide for additional offenses over which superior courts are authorized to exercise exclusive original jurisdiction for the trials of children in 13 to 17 years of age to include the offenses of certain terrorist acts involving public and private schools and for other purposes. Mr. President, Senator Dolez on the 27th, offers the following amendment number 1 to amend the Senate committee on judiciary substitute to Senate bill 61 by replacing lines 133 through 155 with the following A. On public and private school, operate property including on limit to school buildings and school grounds by replacing lines 190 through 192 with the following A. Public or private school, operate property include not limited school buildings and school grounds and for other purposes. Mr. President, that completes the order. I recognize Senator from the 27th, speak to his bill and his amendment. Thank you, Mr. President, colleagues. We have a couple of school safety bills here in a row and Senate bill 61 comes about after conversation between the Lieutenant Governor's office, some of our juvenile court judges, my sheriff's sheriff, Ron Freeman, my school district council, my school superintendent, Mitch Young, and we had a number of things that we heard from them, some of which remain in Senate bill 61 and some of which are in the bill that the Center from the 45th will have, I believe, coming up next. Senate bill 61 adds to the list of crimes that are heard in Superior Court, adds terrorist acts committed against the school. So, when I pause here and point out that we did change in the original bill, we add two new criminal acts in the code, terrorist acts committed against the school and terrorist threats against the school. Originally threats was also given to Superior Court, but after feedback in our committee sub, we haven't such that only the act is what will be heard in Superior Court. The bill also expands to this list to include any aggravated assault or aggravated battery committed with a firearm. Currently in code that only applies if it's against a public safety officer. And so on lines 43 and 44, you will see that we strike the underlying requirement that it be committed against a public safety officer for those to be in Superior Court. In addition, the bill provides Superior Court the exclusive jurisdiction over cases involving criminal conspiracies or criminal attempts to commit the underlying offenses for which Superior Court already has exclusive jurisdiction. As you know, those are things like manslaughter, second degree murder, rape, aggravated assault, and me, et cetera. You will see that on lines 49 to 51. I think it's important to point out at this point as well that the bill preserves the existing authority for a DA at any time before indictment after investigation and for cause to decline the prosecution in Superior Court and bring the case to juvenile court for those between the ages of 13 and 17. You will see that on lines 68 through 71. Section 3 requires DJJ, DHS, and DFAQs to notify a local school system when a child has been because of their behavior placed on electronic monitoring intensive supervision program or home confinement program. One thing that I heard from my sheriff was that often you have kids moving through the system and the school is unaware of that. We want to make sure there's an open line of communication between law enforcement and the school system, but you will see on lines 154 to 167. Then we put guardrails in place to ensure that that information can only be used to keep the school safe and that they will not be used for any sort of confinement in the school against the student that that applies to lines 171 through 235 outline the two new criminal offenses that I talked about. The amendment that's before you amendment one follows through on a commitment that I made in committee to someone who can express concern about the inclusion of adjacent playgrounds off of school and parks off of school property. So all that we're doing with the amendment is clean out up to strike the language as it relates to parks that are adjacent to a school. And then lastly, as you all know members, we have a current school safety plan process that is in place. We strengthen that school safety plan process in section five of the bill by requiring each public school to perform an annual site threat assessment either with local law enforcement or with individuals who Jima has identified as being qualified to do so. We will use that site threat assessment to inform the school safety plans. We move that to an annual process so that every year at every school in the state of Georgia, we are assessing the threat and vulnerability threats and vulnerabilities around unlocked doors open doors, vestibules, things that professionals will identify as vulnerabilities so they can then work those showing up those vulnerabilities into the annual school safety plan. So I'm sorry, Mr. President, I'm happy to answer any questions if we have any. If not, I will yield the well. You do have a question, Senator. I recognize Senator from the 10th. I'm looking for no. I'm sorry, Senator. You do not have any questions. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the well. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm here with his body. First of all, let me say I appreciate the senator from the 27th bringing his legislation. And on when you look at this legislation, you would think it is a great thing to do. And certainly there are some elements of this legislation that to me and certainly to some of my members appears to be problematic. And the reason why it appears to be problematic is because we are criminalizing our kids creating new code sections. And the whole thrust behind this is sending kids and cost of raising kids, rather than rehabilitating kids and getting them the services that they need. I believe there's a different approach when it comes to school safety. We have an opportunity to identify early on who those kids are with early alert systems. We also have an opportunity to get the kids to care that they need. This isn't a novel idea. These are all ideas that we discussed doing our forums, say storage study committee. And these are ideas that I heard overwhelmingly from all of those that attended from the clinicians down to the parents and even students themselves. Most kids do not have to commit these offenses in our school system. Do not have a prior record. And I will set that again. Most kids, not just in Georgia, but across this country that commit these offenses, do not have a prior record. So trying to use our departments of do not justice to identify who those kids are really is problematic. And we need to look at how to address this issue on the front end. I've offered up several bills to do exactly that, Senate Bill 54 and Senate Bill 53. And I would hope that this body would consider looking at this legislation so that we can provide early intervention. We can provide the social services in the clinical care that these kids need and not just provide it, but also continue to ensure that if those kids move out of their original setting, we would still have an opportunity to track those kids. And those new settings that they would happen to move to, would still be made aware of the issues and the problems that they had in a previous school system. So this is, in my opinion, and those of members of my coq is the best way to address the concerns, not by criminalizing early on and trying to look at our department of justice is in the department of corrections and trying to create more, certainly create more sentences for these kids. We need help, they need care, they need the clinicians to work with them early on. And Mr. President, thank you and I you to well encourage you to vote no and consider the approach that we offer in terms of treating this issue display in our great state. Thank you. Thanks, Senator.

Senate Bill 276 by Senator Eccles of the 49th and others of the Bill to be ten and act to amend code section 49-448 of the Fish and God of George and the Table A2 to recovery of medical assistance from third party liable for sickness injury disease or disability so to revive certain provisions to comply with federal law. To bar liable third party payers from refusing payment solely because a health care item or service did not receive prior authorization to acquire a third party payer to respond to an inquiry from the Department of Community Health regarding a health care claim within 60 days to arrive for a later manner to repeal conflicting laws and further purposes. Miss President Senate Committee on Insurance Labor recommends of this bill to pass or expect was minted Senator Walker Chairman that please see order Miss President. Recognize the senator from the 49th. Senator did I see your wife here earlier? The former senator? Well good. Any donors here? Well good. When they come in the back of the chamber let us know so we recognize them. Thank you Mr. President. Good morning colleagues. This morning I bring before you Senate Bill 276 this is an agency bill passed our chamber last year. This legislation addresses federal requirements impacting DCH and Medicaid third party liability. It brings state of Georgia and compliance with the US consolidated appropriations act of 2022. It requires states to have laws and effect that bar liable third parties from refusing payment to Medicaid for a service based solely on the fact that prior authorization was not issued. Medicaid's always been the pair of last resort and only pays for covered services if there are no other liability third party payers. This could be a commercial insurance plan a lawsuit settlement or a workers compensation settlement. This bill will ensure that those primary payment sources cannot unreasonably deny payment to Medicaid for the services for which they are responsible. That is all Mr. President. You have one question Senator I recognize senator from the 42nd. The senator you yes senator. Senator I noticed on lines 18 and line 24 you struck the words the words health care and replace it with health care. What is the difference between health care and health care?

The gentleman knows what he speaks. Do you further yield? One more. One more. On line 32 there's the 60 day requirement still must respond than 60 days of inquiry. If the 60th day falls on a weekend is it all a macro to the Monday or how does that work? Appreciate it goes to Monday. You further yield? Yes sir. Are you pretty sure it goes Monday?

Mr. President Senate committee on children and families recommends this bill to pass by substitute seven and senator Patrick chairman. Mr. President the Senate committee on children and families offers to allow substitute to the Senate bill 259 and bill between 10 and act to amend chapter 11 title 15 of the fish go to Georgia annotated like to the juvenile code says to provide for certain procedures to be followed when there is a determination of suspected child abuse or neglect and for other purposes. Mr. President I can please de-order. Reganized Senate from the six. Thank you Mr. President colleagues. Over a year ago I got a call from an old friend and he was calling me from the hospital that he had been removed from. Just days earlier his grandchild had gone and had some medical complications to where he couldn't breathe. They took this child to the nearest fire department. From that fire department they life-flighted the child. Child's name is bridge. Ridge was life-flighted up to Choa and at Choa it was determined that the breathing stopped from some swelling on the brain and there were some other complications that were caused and so medical evaluation was was commenced on the child and at that moment the medical professional had deemed that Ridge had had been abused as a child. He was abused and Ridge at this time was about six weeks old. The grandfather was calling me and despair not knowing what to do and so I made a few calls to kind of understand the process, get a little better handle on what was about to happen and I called him back and I told him, sir this is going to be awful. What you and your family are about to go through is going to be a nightmare but you have to let this process take place. You want to be sure that that child is not being abused because the nightmare that you're living now would only be worse if that abuse did exist and that child did in fact one day pass away. So when I told him that I was thinking the process might take a few days, worst case scenario maybe a couple weeks. Well the process played out and through court and various other means they brought in they had to hire attorneys, they had to hire doctors, other doctors to come in and give second opinions in the court of law to where the abuse was, it was found there was no abuse it was it was all from some complications that Ridge had at birth that did cause that swelling on the brain and through all that hundreds of thousands of dollars later Ridge was able to go home. 15 months later Ridge was able to go home. For 15 months a family went through a nightmare situation, family torn apart, a child from six weeks old to just over a year old was removed from his from his family. So what this bill does is SB 259 also known as Ridge Ridge's Law thank you to the senator from the 50th who offered that amendment and committee. What Ridge's Law will do is when a child goes to a facility like Choa and goes to see a medical professional and their the child is taking into temporary custody. Well this will allow the parents to do is to get a second opinion and they can get it at that time instead of having to wait and go through the court system. This is modeled after Texas, they have a second opinion law there is very similar to that and the bill is very simple in the first part of the bill. It says that the doctor number one has to review the previous review the child's medical records and that will be filed in the in the de facto system that they did in fact review that those records and should there be a reason that those records were not reviewed that also will be filed in the in the de facto system called shines. And they must then notify the parents of their right to get that second opinion and then the second part of this bill simply makes it very clear that the family can get that second opinion. Now I wish I could tell you that Ridge was is the only case that this has happened. I will say it is it is very rare that this does happen but but rare is too many. Choa does review over 2300 cases of child abuse every year and the number of times this happens is is very small but it does in fact happen and we must give these families a second chance by allowing a second opinion. Well that Mr. President I will yield for questions. You do have one question Senator just recognize Senator from the 44th. Thank you Mr. President will the rules chairman yield? Absolutely. Senator thank you for bringing this bill. Is it not true that I had constituents that had the a very similar situation to Ridge's family? I believe so we had a couple other mothers. We had three mothers in total that testified in committee I believe one of them may have been years and unfortunately that's not the only three that this has happened. There is a there is a bigger number than that that this has happened to and so thank you for that. Yes and isn't it true that the the whole the whole shock family or my constituents upstanding employees at the CDC three children and due to a misunderstanding and lack of second opinion lost all three of their kids for over two years and were also criminally charged until finally those charges were dismissed and it destroyed their life. That's correct the mother gave a very compelling testimony very emotional in fact that was one of the most emotional hearings I've ever sat through as it's very sad I can't can't imagine my children being taken from me. And isn't it also true that they came to me to ask to run interference with defects on this issue? I believe that to be true. Thank you for your work. Thank you. We're going to as a senator from the 32nd. Thank you Senator for your yield. I do madam chair. Is it true that during the committee testimony that just about the entire committee was in tears including yourself? I was bawling that is correct. And isn't it also true center that you work closely with the Department of Human Services the commissioner in particular to be sure that we were doing the right thing on this bill? There's absolutely correct and you bring up a great point because during a separate committee hearing of that you held I had invited Commissioner Brogian and Regina Quick to come back to my office to meet with this grandfather. They were very familiar with the case throughout the year and a half process that went on. I was in touch with the grandfather frequently and many times I reached out to the commissioner directly to get answers and she was very helpful. In that meeting as we were discussing the problem that is when the grandfather brought a solution and the commissioner jumped right on it and said if we can figure out the details quick enough I will absolutely support this and that is how good government supposed to work. We're supposed to listen to our people and then come up with solutions. Thank you senator. Thank you for all your work on this on the great committee that you chair. You have no more questions. Thank you. I urge for everyone's favourable considerations so that we can prevent families from being ripped apart. Please support SB 259 ridges law. Thank you. Thank you senator. We're going to have a sit in front of the 50th. Thank you miss president. I will be brief on this. I just want to applaud senator from the 28th for what he's done with this bill. I've had two constituents that have dealt with this. My wife actually is a juvenile attorney and this was one of the main things she dealt with was parents who had their children taken away and while it is rare for the doctors to get it wrong when they do get it wrong this will help families stay together and I just I want to thank the rules chairman the chairman of children and families in lieutenant government for starting this committee. If you haven't had the opportunity to come it's an emotional committee and it always leaves you feeling better when you walk out so without miss president I'll yield the well. Thank you. Thank you senator. Does any other senator wish to speak before against a measure? Chair here's none. Is there objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair here is none. The previous question is ordered? Question has owned the adoption of the committee's substitute. Is there objection to the adoption of the committee's substitute? Here, you're none.

Is there objection to the main question being ordered? Chair, here's none. Main question is ordered. Questions on the passes of of the bill by substitute, all those in favor of vote. Yay, all those, nay, secretary, and light on the machine. All in the pages of the bill, the A's are 55 and the NA's are zero. This bill can receive the requisite constitutional majority as they're full pass by substitute. Good job, Senator Goodjum. Secretary SB 33. Senate Bill 33 by Senator Kirkpatrick. The 30th second and others will be in ten on active men chapter 23 of Title II. The official of Georgia annotated the Georgia hemp farming act. So it's probably limits on the total THC concentration of consumable hemp products to revise positions, concerning the certificate of analysis. Public will to consumable hemp products to revise and provide for definitions, to write for laid-amatters, for people conflicting laws, and for other purposes. Mr. President, the Senate can be regulated, and the streets and utilities recommends this bill do pass by substitute. The bill is submitted to Senator Kousert-Cherman. Mr. President, the Senate can be regulated, and the interstitial utilities offers the following substitute to Senate Bill 33. You billed to me ten on active men chapter 23, Title II of the official of Georgia annotated the Georgia hemp farming act. So it's probably limits on the total concentration of intoxicating cannabinoids and consumable hemp products to revise provisions, concerning the certificate of analysis, applicable to consumable hemp products to revise and provide for definitions, to write for laid-amatters, to be able to conflicting laws and for other purposes. Mr. President, that completes the order. I'll break it down to the senator from thirty second. Thank you, Mr. President. This bill relates to Delta 8 and other intoxicating cannabinoids that were not included in Senate Bill 494 last year, which required testing and labeling of Delta 9 THC with a maximum concentration of 0.3%. We have reputable processors of consumable hemp products in our state who are already testing and labeling, appropriately, including one in the district of the center from the 13. But we also have products from China and other places that are being sold in gas stations, convenient stores, and smoke shops that are not being appropriately tested. These cannabinoids appear in trace amounts in the plant and they're then enhanced with various chemicals to increase their strength. The products may be contaminated with industrial solvents, heavy metals, and other contaminants. This is a health risk and the FDA has written a number of warning letters due to adverse events, resulting in emergency treatment, including right here in Georgia. And there's one case that I'm personally familiar with in Henry County. This bill includes other intoxicating cannabinoids like Delta 10 that were not captured in last year's bill, because there are others besides Delta 8 that are in this category, including a chemical called HHC, which was actually pointed out to me by the Agriculture Department. Senate Bill 494 already has restricted consumable sales or purchase to adults over 21. As you know, hemp currently has a definition of less than 0.3 percent. Anything above that is marijuana. Hemp products are regulated by the Department of Agriculture, marijuana by the Marijuana Commission. This bill has nothing to do with medical cannabis. What this bill does is add Delta 8 and other intoxicating cannabinoids to the total THC concentration of a product on lines 110 and 111. After defining intoxicating cannabinoids on line 55 to 63, it adds authority to the department to add any compound or group of compounds considered to be a health and safety threat on line 141. This bill is not a ban. It's a consumer protection bill that is not intended to impact processors that are already testing and labeling their products appropriately. It's intended to make sure that consumers buying these products are clear on what they are buying. The Agriculture Commissioner and his team are working hard to implement the program we put in place last year. And this bill is intended to help them in their efforts to protect consumers. I appreciate their input into the bill. You have a letter on your desk from the Georgia CERF's Association in support of this bill due to the many challenges faced by law enforcement and dealing with impaired individuals. The bill passed a regulated industries committee unanimously and I would appreciate your support. I'm happy to answer any questions. You have no questions Senator. Thank you. Does any other senator which speak for against the measure? Chair here is none. Is there objection to the previous question being ordered? The question is only the option of the committee to substitute. Is there objection to the option of the committee to substitute? Here none of the committee to substitute is adopted. The question is on the passes of the bill by substitute all those in favor of O.A. All opposed. Thank you. The bill is on the passes of the bill. The bill has received the constitutional majority passed by substitution. Secretary Reed, Senate bill 254. Senator Bill 254 by Senator Couser, bill 46. Senator Bill 109 to amend chapter 23. The official got a Georgia annotated. The Georgia hemp farming access to provide milligram limits on Delta 9 THC and consumeable hemp products. The provide for laid-of-manage through the public looking laws and further purposes. Mr. President, Senate Committee on Regulated Industries and Utilities recommends this bill due passed by substitute is five minutes. Senator Couser, Chairman. Mr. President, Senate Committee on Regulated Industries and Utilities offers to following substitute to Senate bill 254. Bill 109 to amend chapter 23. The title two of the official got a Georgia annotated. The Georgia hemp farming access to provide milligram limits on THC and consumeable hemp products to provide for definition to provide for laid-of-manage through the public looking laws and further purposes. That can be seen under Mr. President. I recognize the senator from the 46. Thank you, Mr. President. Senators, it's interesting all the different subject matters we learned serving in this body this year. Last year we learned an awful lot about hemp products and THC. We first regulated this in last year's Senate bill that gave the enforcement powers to the Department of Agriculture and also gave them the power to issue rules and regulations further controlling the use of hemp products. What we've learned is that the federal limit of 0.3% THC in a hemp product is an enormous amount of THC when you extrapolate it out to the volume. We've learned that this 0.3% dry weight is the equivalent of over a thousand milligrams of THC for a 12 ounce beverage. Most states are limiting greatly the amount of THC that can be included in a beverage or in a texture or any kind of lotions or in gummies. And the reason is to protect the consumers, protect the public from the psychoactive components of THC. So you're going to get high. What the science has shown us, we learned an awful lot in regulated industries is 2.5 milligrams will get you high. 5 milligrams, no question. And if you look on your desk, the senator from the 56 has sent out a little chart that shows the equivalent of 2.5 milligrams of THC to beers. And basically the best they can translate that is 2.5 milligrams is equal to a beer, a glass of wine or a shot of liquor. What we're trying to do in this bill is just follow up on what the senator from the 32nd just passed on including capturing all forms of THC. Not just Delta 9 which naturally occurs in Hemp and marijuana, but also capture Delta 8, Delta 10, other variants that are still THC. This bill captures them all as well, but it essentially codifies the rules and regulations that the Department of Agriculture came up with. Back in the fall, the original rules and regulations of the Department of Agriculture limited you to 5 milligrams per 12-mounts beverage and would not allow you to have larger than a 12-ounce container for the liquid forms of these Hemp infused beverages. It limited the gummies to 10 milligrams per gummy and no more than 150 per package, which would be 15 servings. As far as the topical creams and what not, it limited you to 1,000 milligrams of Delta 9 THC per package. And then the tinctures which are little oils, it limited you there to 1 milligram, not to exceed 10 fluid ounces in a container. This January those rules were updated and they increased the beverage from 5 milligrams to 10 and it increased the amount per package from 150 to 300. What this does is go back and codify the original rules, takes it back down to 5 milligrams per beverage and back down to 150 milligrams per package of the gummies. This is for public safety, you may hear other people speak on this, but these current 10 milligram beverages are like four shots of liquor, four glasses of wine or four beers, all in one can. So what we're doing is allowing folks to sell beverages that will impair your ability to do a lot of things but for one to drive. It's still illegal to drive under the influence of alcohol and we tell you what's the level that we deem to be intoxicated or to impair you. You may have heard .08 so that's roughly four beers we say is intoxicating your impaired on T.H.C. I don't know if the science is there to tell exactly how many milligrams or nanograms it takes to impair you, but I think the everybody in the industry agrees that if a 10 milligram serving is equal to four beers. Or four glasses of wine or four shots of liquor, you take that in one time.\n\ngoing to be impaired and the law in Georgia is your DUI drugs if there's any THC in your blood test. So we're putting loaded guns in people's hands in the form of a can or a gummy and we need to protect them. We need to keep it away from children and we need to make sure that people are responsible in their usage of these products. So with that Mr. President, I strongly encourage passes of this as we just codify the stricter rules and regulations and try to sort of get our arms around this new industry. I yield for any questions or may be. You have no questions, Senator. Thank you. I yield the well and ask for your support. Secretary, read the amendment. Mr. President, Senator Roberts, Senator 29th, and I'll be with the 56th off of the following amendment number one to amend the Senate Committee on Regulation and Instraising until these substitute to Senate Bill 254, by placing line two with the following. I'm farming access to prohibit the sale of consumable hemp beverages that contain THC, to provide milligram limits on THC consumable hemp, by placing lines 44 and 45 with the following be a drink or beverage that inserting eye contains striking contains alcohol or constitutes an alcohol beverage under Title III and serving or eye contains THC, Mr. President, that can please and for other purposes that Mr. President, that can please the order. Bring it out and Senator from the 29th, speak to the amendment. Hello, colleagues. This is a very simple amendment. I'll keep it very brief. We're on a bullet train with Dylan with marijuana. Now let's be clear, that's what we're dealing with. You can call it cannabis, you can call it CBD, you can call it whatever you want to call it. You know, farmers, product, whatever, we're dealing with marijuana, weed, the chronic, whatever you want to say. That's what we're dealing with. What this amendment does is it prohibits the sale of beverages that contain THC in Georgia. And I never thought I would stand in this well and say this. The state of California just put out an emergency order three weeks ago, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, to pull all THC, all beverages containing THC off the shelves in California. Because of the adverse effects on people that were buying it out there, and the damage it was causing, and the numbers of individuals going to the emergency room. California has been dancing in the arena of marijuana for years and years and years, and they realize that they don't have control over it. We need to pump the brakes, slow down, and let's make sure we're doing the right thing for our state. And another very political thing to say, but is absolutely true in this case. I was talking to two of my colleagues just a few minutes ago. It's not about those of us in this room sitting here, the adults that I'm looking at. It's about our children. It's about my five granddaughters. It's about your children. Think of the world they're coming to while we're making these fast decisions related to something that there is so limited study on because it's a schedule one drug, and we have not been allowed to run the types of medical tests on these that we should. So I would ask you, please, to support the amendment, and I would also ask my friend from the 46 not to object. And with that, Mr. President, I'll stand for any questions. If I have any, if not, I'll be happy to yield the well. Do you have one question, Senator? Yes. Senator from the first. Thank you, Mr. President. Is the Senator to you? I do. I just wanted to applaud you for bringing this amendment. Certainly, the Senator from the 46 does put breaks on that and allows tries to thread a needle when it comes to that. But basically, what we're talking about is not the next bill where we're discussing medical marijuana. This is a really recreational marijuana that we're getting to. We're combining alcohol and THC in a formula that we really don't know what the outcome is going to be because there's not been good studies relating to this because this has been a schedule one drug. So I agree with you. We do need to pump the breaks on this as far as I'm concerned doing a wave of beverages. I think is a good idea. Let's keep it in the medical marijuana arena with the other 18 states that do this, isn't that true? That is true. My good friend and the doctor from the first, I appreciate your support and thank you. And with that, Mr. President, I'll happily yield the wealth. You have one question, but you always welcome to yield, Senator. I will take that one question from the 41st. Thank you, Mr. President. Senator, do you yield? I do. Can you just say in plain English again, what exactly your amendment is trying to do? If you read on line three, you'll see so asked to prohibit the sale of consumable beverages that contain THC. To be clear, if you will, you are attempting to take from the market any drinks that have THC in them. You and I just communicated perfectly. Yes, ma'am, that is true. Thank you. Thank you. Senator, do you have any other questions? Senator's yielded. Any other senator would speak for against a measure? Chair, here's none. We are questions on the adoption of Amendment 1. Adoption Amendment 1 authored by the senator from the 29th. I was getting to that, Senator. We do have objection. Would you like to speak for a objection, Senator? No. No. All right. So the question is on the adoption of Amendment 1. We do have objection from several members. So all those in favor of the adoption of Amendment 1 will vote ye. On the adoption of Amendment 1, the yeas of 29, the nays of 27, senator from the 14th. What purpose do you rise? Move to reconsider that amendment, Mr. President. All right. The senator from the 14th has moved for reconsideration. So all those in favor of the amendment will vote ye. All opposed, nay, secretary. I don't want to say. This is for reconsideration. This is for reconsideration right here. All those in favor of reconsideration will vote ye. All opposed, nay, secretary. I'm not in the machine. All in the motion for reconsideration, the yeas are 27, the nays are 29, and the amendment has passed. The amendment has been adopted, excuse me. since yananad great you you you On the passage of the bill the a's are 42 the nas are 14 this bill haven't received the registered constitutional majority therefore passed by substitute All right, so we're going to go ahead and stand at ease for lunch another his staff have got a good good lunch lined up for all the members here. So we're going to just stand at ease and we'll come back we'll come back about 115.",
