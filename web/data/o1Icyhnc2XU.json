Camp\nrepresentative chair lady Beth\ncamp\nthank you Mr Speaker and good morning\nmembers I am honored here today to\nintroduce my friend Billy Smith Billy\nSmith is the pastor at Christ Chapel\ncommunity church located in zebulun\nGeorgia and he has been there for 20\nyears he is the founder of the church um\nChrist Chapel has six locations in\nzebulin Hamilton Hampton fville The\nPavilion and Barnesville I can assure\nyou that Scott\num Hilton knows where none of those\nplaces are but I can assure you they're\nwonderful places to be um Billy Smith\nhas been married to his lovely wife Tina\nfor 28 years and they have four children\nCole Laney Max and Ruby and Max is\njoining us today I just wanted to speak\na little bit about Billy Smith um a\nquote comes to mind a friend is one who\noverlooks your broken Vents and admires\nyour flowers\nanyway um at Christ Chapel there's a big\nsign on the wall it's lit it's lit up\nit's beautiful and it says saved people\nserve people I think that is\nprobably one of the greatest things I do\nlove about Christ Chapel is their\ndedication to serving the community and\num and loving people where they are and\naccepting people when they come in quite\nhonestly I can't think of a more\nwelcoming environment to come to On Any\nSunday morning and at this time I'd like\nto introduce Pastor Billy\nSmith Mr speaker thank you sir\nabsolutely good\nmorning thank you representative camp\nfor those kind words Mr Speaker thanks\nfor the opportunity uh I'll be brief\nwith my remarks today uh you probably\nheard your pastor say that before too\nbut I mean it I'll be brief I want to\ntalk to you just for a short few minutes\nin the way of a devotion about four O's\nthe letter o in the alphabet\nopportunities opposition obedience and\noutcomes opportunities opposition\nobedience and outcomes uh in the Old\nTestament there's a Biblical character\nnamed Nehemiah um he had been exiled\nfrom his home after a war and the walls\nof his town that he lived in and he\nloved Jerusalem had been burned and\nbroken and they were laying on the\nground he got this news and he was\ncompelled to go back and help organize\nhe was a great leader organized uh the\neffort to rebuild that wall in Nehemiah\n1:4 it says when Nehemiah heard that the\nwalls of Jerusalem were still broken\ndown after a half century of the\ncompletion of the rebuilding of the\ntemple he sat down and he wept uh most\nof us have something in our life that\nwe're so passionate about that it makes\nus cry or it makes us laugh we it gets\nus up every day and it gets our motor\nrunning and and those are opportunities\nthat each of us will have in life uh one\nthing about opportunities uh you'll have\nsometimes more in life than you know\nwhat to do with there's a biblical term\nconcerning opportunities I think it's\nimportant for us to understand it's\ncalled\nuh the ability to discern discern is\nlike cognitive like I have a mind to\nmake choices but there's a spiritual\ncomponent about that also about being\nled and everybody in this room you have\nopportunities every day we have to\ndecide which one of those are from God\nand which one of those are just good\nopportunities that maybe we should pass\non Nicodemus or excuse me Nehemiah could\nnot pass on the opportunity to go home\nand rebuild the walls he saw the\nopportunity and he seized it uh\nunfortunately opportunity has a\ncompanion every time there's an\nopportunity there's always opposition\nI'm sure you're aware of that when you\nhave an opportunity and you want to do\nsomething great you want to make a\ndifference opposition always shows up\neven the Apostle Paul in the New\nTestament 1 Corinthians 16 and8 it says\nthat uh I'm going to stay on on here in\nEphesus he was pastoring and preaching\nin Ephesus uh because a great door of\neffective work has opened for me I have\nan opportunity but then he goes on to\nsay but there will be many here who\noppose me and every time there's an\nopportunity in life there will always be\nopposition Nehemiah goes back to\nJerusalem gets permission from the King\nthat he is serving to go home and he\ngets back there and he meets with\nopposition a guy named tobiah another\nguy named sand ballot and they had\nfriends cronies bully bullies that\nwanted to intimidate the workers and the\nforce that he had gathered to rebuild\nthose walls I just want to remind you\nthat opportunities come and when you\nseize them when you take advantage of\nthem there will always be opposition uh\nthe other o is is obedience when\nopposition comes we have to decide if\nwe're going to stand firm um and our\nstance do we have grit tenacity are we\nconsistent will we stay with it uh what\nI find in scripture is from Genesis to\nRevelation there are men and women in\nthe Bible who obeyed who obeyed God and\nevery time they obey God it seems to be\na systematic structure in Scripture that\nblessing follows obedience and\nunfortunately cursing and Hope\nhopelessness and a lack of Joy follow us\nwhen we don't obey God we have to decide\nafter we had this great opportunity we\nexperience opposition will we remain\nobedient in the call in the in the\nopportunity that God has given us the\nfourth o is outcomes uh I've learned a\nlong time ago I don't always control\noutcomes I wish I did I do control the\nopportunities that I take I control my\nattitude and my heart with opposition\nand how I handle that I control whether\nor not I'll remain obedient to that\nopportunity or that call but I've\nlearned that God is responsible for all\noutcomes I've worked hard a few times\nand still failed I haven't worked as\nhard as other times and had great\nsuccess in life outcomes really belong\nto God Nehemiah went back organized used\nhis leadership skills rebuilt the wall\nand the Bible says he rebuilt those\nwalls in 52 days him and his Partners in\nthat in that in that passage of time to\nmake that wall uh go up and be able to\ndefend their City 52 days if Genesis\nWorld Records had been around they' have\nwent over there and made note of it I\ncan't believe this happen so quick now\nGod controlled that outcome but there\nare other areas in our lives where we\nhave made plans and uh we have worked\nhard and it didn't turn out the way that\nwe hoped so we leave that in the hands\nof God I start where I'm at I use what I\nhave and I do what I can and I let God\ndo the things I can't do I hope the four\nO's today will help you opportunities\nopposition obedience and outcomes would\nyou stand today and let's go to the Lord\nin\nprayer we do want to remember uh the\nyoung lady that lost her life Miss lak\nand Riley our hearts are heavy for that\nfamily today I'd also like to remember\nTrooper edner who lost his life last\nweek work in a accident scene it's been\na hard week for Georgia and uh God still\nloves us he still wants to take care of\nus father I ask you today for for wisdom\nand discernment and understanding help\nme to realize that all my opportunities\ncome from you you're good and generous\nand gracious God when those\nopportunities come with opposition help\nme to know how to handle that and keep\nmy eyes fixed on you give us all a\ngod-sized courage today to obey and walk\nobedience out we celebrate today God the\noutcomes no matter what they are thank\nyou for loving us caring us caring for\nus and uh thank you God for being our\nbiggest cheerleader you're smiling over\nus today would you bless what happens in\nthis room today I pray those things in\nThe Wonderful Name of Christ amen let's\npledge allegiance this morning I pledge\nallegiance to the flag of the United\nStates of America to the Republic for\nwhich it stands one nation under God\nindivisible with liberty and justice for\nall thank you Pastor Billy for those\n40's\ndoorkeepers you may unlock the\ndoors and

you for some Grace I typically pride\nmyself in keeping composure when\nspeaking from the well and I acknowledge\ntoday that I may\nfail right now I stand Here representing\na district a city a university that is\nexperiencing a wide array of emotions\nfrom grief to anger and everything in\nbetween Wyatt Banks and lake and Riley\nto the rest of the state these may may\njust be two names heard on the news but\nto my community there are a son and a\ndaughter a friend and a sibling a soryy\nsister and fraternity brother a\nclassmate and fellow\ndog while these two situations are woven\ntogether by grief in a shared Community\nthey're unique in the shortcomings and\nfailures that highlight for this body\nand and for all elected officials it's\nevident there's work to be\ndone and there will be time for that\nthere'll be time for discourse\nlegislation accountability but that is\nnot today I believe we all can agree\nright now as the time for honoring these\ntwo beautiful young lives robbed of\ntheir bright future\nWyatt Banks was a freshman and member of\nKaa Sigma fraternity he was a political\nscience major whose future may have\ncrossed paths with any one of us in this\nroom he took academics seriously was a\nmember of the Terry College of Business\nand Morehead Honors College one of his\nfraternity Brothers stated Wyatt\ndiligently excelled in academics as a\nmember of Morehead Honors College and\nwas always eager to help his friends in\nschool School whenever they needed it\nsomeone else said he had a radiant smile\nand contagious\nlaughter Wyatt's positive impact on his\nfriends and family is\nevident I would like you to I'd like to\nask you to join me in a moment of\nsilence to honor Wyatt banks in the\nlight he brought to those around\nhim Lake and Riley lak was 22 a nursing\nstudent a runner a member of alpha Kai\nOmega sorority and a Dean list student\nlak's roommate said she never met a\nstranger and she exuded kindness and\nacceptance to anyone she\nmet her family said she's amazing\ndaughter sister friend and overall\nperson and will be missed every day it\nis evident that lakan's life was spent\nin laughter and\nlove I would like to ask you to join me\nin a moment of silence to honor Lake and\nRiley and the light she brought to those\naround\nher I know that several of us in this\nroom have sons and daughters who\nrecently attended or graduated from the\nUniversity of\nGeorgia so this tragedy hits close to\nhome and honestly I can't begin to\nFathom the Heartbreak these two families\nare navigating and I hope you will join\nme in covering them with prayers in the\nweeks to\ncome but for every single person in this\nchamber hug your loved one call them\ncheck on them cherish\nthem

committee\nrecommends that this bill do pass by\ncommittee\nsubstitute chair recognizes\nrepresentative Leverett to present the\nBill thank you madam speaker ladies and\ngentlemen I'm pleased to present to you\nhouse bill\n825 um this bill uh is not only um a\ngreat bill it's a source of some really\ngood Georgia\ntrivia um if anyone ever asks you what\nis the only single County Circuit in\nGeorgia where the county side is located\nin an unincorporated area of the county\nand the county governing Authority has\nconstructed one or more permanent\nsatellite cour houses in the county you\nwill now be able to all them with your\ntrivia knowledge that is Columbia County\nthat's the only county in the state this\nbill applies to apparently U this would\nhave been a local Bill several years ago\nbut the uh legislative Council now\ncontends that even a retirement bill\nthat just impacts one county has to be\npassed as a general legislation so we're\namending a section in the code and by\nadding a paragraph here that applies a\nDA retirement for this one circuit based\non and it's a single County Circuit\nbased on the supplement paid to that da\nso this has absolutely no impact on\nState uh coffers it is not a bill that\nwill apply to any other circuit in the\nstate except for the Columbia County\njudicial circuit the county endorses it\nsupports it and has requested it as has\nthe da\nand I would encourage your favorable\nconsideration of this bill you have a\nquestion the chair recognizes\nrepresentative Clark for a\nquestion thank you madam speaker does\nthe gentleman yield yes ma'am so right\nnow this only applies to Columbia County\nbut in the future if a county did create\nsatellite because it's very specific\nthen they would be swooped into this as\nwell correct well almost they would have\nto first of all have unincorporated\nCounty site I'm not aware of any other\nCounty except for Colombia County that\nhas that and they would have to build\nsatellite cour houses within the county\nthank so I I don't think it really is\nlikely or feasible that it would ever\napply to any County other than Columbia\nthank you thank you chair

code section\n16820 of the official quod of George\nannotated relating the livestock theft\nso to provide for increased penalties\nand to provide for related matters this\nbill ad referred to the committee on\nJudiciary non- civil that committee\nrecommends that this bill do pass by\ncommittee\nsubstitute chair recognizes the newly\nmarried representative Smith to present\nthe\nBill thank you madam speaker pro team\nyou're very kind uh today members I\nbring to you house bill 27 and just to\nlet yall know what this would do this\nwould enhance the penalties for theft of\nlivestock in the state of Georgia these\nenhanced penalties will help producers\nof livestock and animal products from\ntheft of their very livelihood so what I\nwill let everyone know is this since\n2019 you have seen the price of all of\nyour cattle uh that includes not only\ncows Hogs chickens uh Guinea if some of\ny'all still eat that here in the state I\nknow my great grandmother did but anyhow\nuh this bill would help us to make sure\nthat those who are subject to theft of\nlivestock that we can lock these folks\nup and that the penalties would reflect\nyou're looking at a price of cattle uh\nanywhere from a good Cal calf pair\nyou're looking at right around\n$1,800 Black Angus at least Bulls going\nfor much more than that but uh let me\nexplain to you with small farms versus\nlarge Farms this cost to small farm arm\nyou're looking at supplemental income\nfor many folks especially north of I20\nuh this is a huge detriment you're\ntalking about people going without when\nthey have their cattle stolen uh I also\nwant to Mark out or make sure that I\npoint your attention uh we added a\nsection to the bill and committee\nrequested from the Department of\nAgriculture to actually allow the\nDepartment of Agriculture if there's an\nagricultural Nexus and some kind of\ncrime that they would have the authority\nto enforce that uh We've actually got\nsome ongoing cattle rustling\ninvestigations going on it's not just\nlimited to cattle rustling but this\nwould give them the requisite authority\nto clear up the code section to make\nsure that they can protect our livestock\nas well as our agricultural products\nhere in the state of Georgia so Madam\nspeaker protim that is the bill and I'll\nstand for any\nquestions you have a couple questions\nthe chair recognizes representative\ndunahoo for a question to your left does\nthe gentleman you I do is it true no one\nhas come on my farm and stole any of my\nhoney bees you know I I would believe\nthat to be true and that if they had\nthey'd have been in for a warm welcome\nthat's right chair recognizes\nrepresentative Clark to your left for a\nquestion thank you madam speaker does a\ngentleman yield I do for a question um\nso in this bill I noticed that the fine\ngoes from being\n$1,000 to\n$10,000 that's a\n1,000% increase was there is there a\nreason why the increase is such a large\namount that's a deterrent effect I will\npoint the G lady to historically they\nwould hang you for these sort of\noffences if you stole livestock so uh I\nI know it seems like it's uh very very\nuh steep increases but uh I will remind\nthe general lady that used to they would\nhang you for these sort of offenses this\nis also to reflect the increased cost\nlike I'd mentioned earlier that uh the\nfine needs to at least match uh a little\nbit more than what the cost of the\nlivestock would be because if you let's\nsay that you went and you stole a whole\nherd you're well over that $110,000\namount yeah did the J in further yield\none more question so if you um sto a\nwhole herd yes that would make sense but\nwhat if you just stole one and I don't\num condone stealing anything but if you\njust stole one cow would that be the\nequivalent of increasing this fine by so\nmuch it just seems like a very big jump\nso I'm just trying to understand the and\nI appreciate my informed colleague and\nyour question I I would say this it does\ncome down a lot of times to the\ndeterrent effect I think the fine is a\nlot more civilized than going back to\nHanging folks for this offense well I\ncan definitely agree with that um thank\nyou thank you with that Madam speaker I\nappreciate the good questions and I\nwould yield this well and ask this\nbody's favorable consideration the\ngentleman has yielded the well is there\nany objection to the previous question\nbeing ordered the chair hears none the\nprevious question is ordered is there\nany objection to adopting the

Chet to\npresent the Bill thank you Mr Speaker\nand thank you colleagues I come to you\nuh to present a very simple bill that is\nnot the\n[Laughter]\ncase uh I have learned in the um this\nthis past year more about navigable\nwaterways than I care to know in the\nrest of my life frankly um but I'm going\nto give you a little history about the\nbill and what the bill does um you can\nrecall sigy dive last year we passed a\nbill Senate Bill 115 and what the bill\nsought to do was to ensr gr the Public's\nright to hunt fish in navigable\nwaterways now one of the things I I want\nto point out for you all is this\nnavigable is a defined term in statute\nit doesn't mean that you can just float\nuh if you can float that's common term\nnavigable but the statute has a very\ndifferent term you must be able to\nconduct Commerce up and down the river\nat least some portion of the of the year\nso what cinel 115 did was introduced one\nof these doctrines it introduced the\npublic trust\nDoctrine and over the ye over this past\nyear we had a special sub a um study\ncommittee to um to study this issue\nbecause it is a complex\nissue the problem that came out of and\nthe excuse me the recommendation that\ncame out of that study committee was\nthis the recommendation was to remove\nthe words public trust Doctrine from\nSenate Bill 115 while while retaining\nthe underlying purpose of Senate Bill\n115 and that's what this bill 1172 seeks\nto do one of the other recommendations\nwas to uh bring Clarity to whether or\nnot you can um trespass on somebody's\nproperty uh when floating down a\nnavigable Waterway so that's is another\nprovision that we added into this bill\nso you know all I you you all know that\nI'm a fan of the language in the bill\nand so I'm going to run through the bill\nand uh try to explain to you uh what the\nbill does and why the strikes were made\nfirst thing I want to say to you is\nthis nothing in this bill does anything\nto impact non-navigable\nwaterways right there's a distinction\nhere it's a property rights distinction\na navigable Waterway the property owner\ntypically owns from the low water mark\nback in a a non-navigable Waterway they\ntypically own to the center of the\nthread why is that\nimportant because if you own to the\ncenter of the thread in a navigable\nWaterway then perceivably you own you\nown the stream bed and then there may be\na problem with you walking and uh being\non the stream bed so nothing is nothing\nin this bill changes what you can do on\na non-navigable Waterway so you you'd\nlikely been uh talking to or or gettinga\nemails and text messages from folks in\nthe paddling community and they\ntestified in committee and their\ntestimony was that you're taking away\nour rights well the law as it stands\ntoday and if the P if 1172 passes is\nthat non-navigable waterways if you're\nhunting fishing or floating you're doing\nit at the permission of the property\nowner you're not doing it at the a right\nthat was given to you by the state or\nright that we've claimed that's a fact\nthat is how the law sits right now today\nokay and so I want to make that clear\nbecause everybody has come to me with\nquestions with regard to non-navigable\nwaterways this bill only impacts or\naffects navigable\nwaterways so going through the bill the\nfirst recommendation was we struck the\nlanguage for public trust Doctrine and\nthat's what happens on lines 11 through\n15 well in on 16\nthrough 19 we recited how the well this\nis what I like to call a conclusion of\nlaw in Senate Bill 115 we concluded in\nSenate Bill 115 that we had the right\nand we utilized the public trust\nDoctrine as the means for saying that we\nhad that\nright here on 17 and 18 and 19 we recite\nthe fact that we that the state retains\nthe ownership of the beds but it's\nimportant to note in C Bill\n115 that we delineated where the state\nowned the beds if a if you had a pre-\n1863 Grant so a Crown's Grant before the\nstate uh inherited the land or took the\nland then you have a superior right this\nis just common property law you have a\nsuperior right so you got your rights to\nthe tream bed prior to the state could\neven get the rights or give away the\nrights so in in the event and and you\nguys recall all of this um all of this\nstemmed from a piece of litigation that\nhas now settled and the litigation was\num that the owner had a pre 1863 Grant\nand had exclusive rights to the the\nriverbed right all the settlement\nsettlement as I understand it and\nspeaking with some of the parties\ninvolved is that the settlement is that\nthey folks can continue to pass through\nthey have exclusive rights to the fish\nand they have exclusive rights to the\nbed that was an agreement between the\nstate and this property owner this does\nnot impact that so what we've done here\nhas said that in a navigable stream\nbetter bed excuse me not a better excuse\nme in a navigable streamed the right of\nhunting fishing and passage is extends\nfrom low water mark to low water mark So\nrecall what I said at the very beginning\na navigable stream uh in a navigable\nstream the property owner typically owns\nfrom low water mark back so we've\nrecited exactly what the right is here\nyou have the right to pass you have the\nright to hunt you have the right to fish\nin a navigable stream bed no matter what\nthat's the only thing we've done we've\nsought to Cle to clear this up now I\nthink you'll hear testimony about how do\nyou fish or how do you hunt or how do\nyou do any of these things without touch\nimpacting the stream bed well the fact\nof the matter is there is nowhere not in\nSenate Bill 115 not in anywhere in\nstatute that anybody has said that you\nhave a right to the stream bed there's\nno no nowhere in in code that you can\nfind that or I can find that and if you\ncan find that please point that out to\nme so what you're going to hear is that\nwe're restraining the right well we're\nnot we're not doing that I can tell you\nfrom from my perspective I want to\npreserve the right to hunt fish and pass\nin navigable streams I have a son that\nloves to fish for red breast I love to\nfish for red breast I'm not a big duck\nhunter at least on the river um and I\nlove to float and fish so it's not a\nit's not a right that I want to\nconstrain what we want to do is clear up\nan issue that is cloudy and it continues\nto be cloudy we're trying to there's\nanother companion bill I have with this\nand you probably already um had folks\nreach out to you for this as I see it\nthis bill here 1172 clarifies what your\nright is the following bill is going to\nsay where you can utilize that right\nbasically a presumptive a presumption of\nthe state's navigable Waters the last\npiece of this bill is this nothing\ncontained in this subsection shall\nconstrue to permit entry upon privately\nowned lands adjacent to navigable\nstreams I can sit here and tell you\ntoday that it's has never been the\nintention of this General Assembly or\nanybody in this body that I know of that\nsays that you should be able to float\ndown a river jump out of the river onto\nprivate property and then sourn picnic\ngo hunt do whatever you want to do that\nwas the the biggest push back or\ncontention that I saw in the study\ncommittee folks saying we we we're fine\nwith people floating we're fine with\npeople fishing we're fine with people\nhunting on the river but we are not fine\nwith people getting out of the river and\ngoing on the bank and so what this\nprovision seeks to do is clarify nothing\nin this law allows anyone to get out of\nthe navigable Waterway and go onto the\nproperty there is a name for that we've\nalready defined that what that is called\nas trespassing that's all that's all\nthis bill does and I've said a bunch and\nand uh I shouldn't minimize what I've\nsaid this is not an easy issue this is a\na tough issue um but I I I I Tell You\nFolks what we're doing here is\nclarifying an issue that is very cloudy\nand part of the reason that we're doing\nthis is because what we're having is\naltercations on a river or stream Bank\nyou have folks literally I'll give you a\nfor instance you have a father and a son\nfloating down in a\ncanoe and you have a property owner\nshooting at them now you guys you guys\nEnvision that now now this this this is\na real issue and if we do not clear this\nup you're just going to continue to have\nthis problem and there's going to be a\nyou know some pain in doing this but I'm\ntelling you we have Rewritten this\nlanguage 15 times no less trying to\nappease everyone here but ultimately\nthis is what you're doing you're\nbalancing private property rights with\nthe right to hunt fish and pass that's\nall we're doing here and Mr Speaker I'm\ngoing to yield to well unless there are\nany questions and you have a couple of\nquestions very good uh chairman Corvett\nto your right is recognized for a\nquestion thank you Mr Speaker does\ngentleman y yes sir is it not true that\nthe public truck trust Doctrine is an\narea of law that has never been applied\nto our freshwater rivers and streams\nuntil\nsb15 yes sir that is absolutely true and\nI thank you for asking that question the\nthe public trust Doctrine is a doctrine\nthat is that has history in the United\nStates and in Georgia but on the\nmarshlands it Senate Bill 115 is the\nfirst time the public trust Doctrine has\never been overlaid onto the fresh waters\nof the state of Georgia to my\nknowledge representative mck Jackson\nchairman Jackson has a question to your\nright out in front of you thank you Mr\nSpeaker does gentleman yield to my\nfriend I do yes sir is it not true that\nthis was a learning experience on this\nstudy\ncommittee I I agree yes it was father do\nyou father yield yes sir I do is it not\ntrue that this legislation will have no\nimpact on the assess rights of hunters\nand Anglers but will provide additional\nprivate property right protection to\nsome Georgians that is absolutely true\nand thank you Mr um representative\nJackson representative ntz to your left\nin the corner has a question does the\ngentleman\nyield yes is there any language in this\nbill that could be construed as taking\nor removing any existing rights that\nrepairi and land owners currently have\nno and I thank you for that question so\nit was posed to me that because we\nrecited um the right that you have uh on\nlines 21 and 22 for the second time we\nsaid but in such cases the Public's\nright is limited only to such navigable\nstreams for passage and for hunting and\nfor fishing and it was posed to me that\nbecause we said that twice that a judge\nMay interpret it different than what the\nwords say on the paper but I don't\nbelieve there is any language in here\nthat says anything other than what it\nsays that you have the right to hunt\nfish fish and pass on a navigable water\nthank you for that clarification thank\nyou chairman Meeks to your right has a\nquestion back in the corner thank you Mr\nSpeaker this gentleman yield yes sir I\njust want to make sure that I'm hearing\nyou correct nothing in this legislation\nprohibits or in or intrudes on my rights\nto fish on a navigable Waterway is that\ncorrect that's correct thank you m thank\nyou Mr thank you sir Mr Speaker we could\nbe I can do this all day but I will not\nI'm going to yield the well your choice\nyes sir I yield the\nwell you finally made a really good\nchoice thank you so\nmuch and the wisdom of the rules\ncommittee they have limited debate on\nall of the issues before us this\nafternoon so pursue it to house R\n33.3 we have 30 minutes for those in\nfavor of this proposition 30 minutes for\nthose opposed and then 20 minutes for\nthe chair's time and 20 minutes for a\nMinority Report we we'll begin with\nthose\nopposed you have 30 minutes so there's\nfour of you signed up to speak against\nthe bill so I will let y'all divide the\ntime as y'all see fit representative\nJenkins is recognized to speak in\nopposition to the bill representative\nJenkins\nmembers of the House Mr Speaker friends\ntoday I Rise an opposition of House Bill\n1172 I want to begin by saying how much\nrespect I have for everyone who has\nworked on this issue regardless of the\nposition they take\ntoday um particularly to the whip uh we\ndon't see eye to eye on this but he he\ncertainly worked this issue to to try to\nget me on board and and I have the\ngreatest respect for that uh so it's\nit's with this uh spirit that I deliver\nthese remarks to you\ntoday although 1172 affects all Georgia\nRivers I will focus my comments on this\nissue to my River the Flint\nRiver uh and quite honestly the way\nHouse Bill uh or Senate bill at 115 came\nabout last year I think a lot of the\nstuff I say I'm saying today we probably\nwould have already heard but uh I want\nto make sure it's said in this chamber\nlast year the Monday before s die a\nlawsuit was settled by DNR between the\nstate of Georgia and a property owner on\nthe Flint River this settlement created\na procedure by which any landowner\nowning riverfront property in Georgia\ncould exclude the public from the river\nwith the support of the governor's\noffice we passed s SP 115 on sadaa to\ncorrect this loophole created in Georgia\nlaw by this settlement the bill\nguaranteed that the public would\ncontinue to have access to Georgia\nRivers and I'm so grateful to everyone\nwho made this legislation possible and\neach and every one of you who voted in\nfavor of it this was ironically the 50th\nanniversary of when then Governor Jimmy\nCarter sent a letter to the core of\nengineers directing them to cancel the\nproject to put dams on the Flint River\nand preserve this River in its natural\nstate for the citizens of\nGeorgia to come to this conclusion\nPresident Carter made several canoe\ntrips down the river one of which where\nhe camped at Sproul\nBluff the core of engineers evaluated\nthat one of the primary benefits of this\nReservoir project was\nRecreation Carter disagreed he assessed\nthat there were eight large reservoirs\nwithin 60 Mi of this River he also\nassessed that there was a rapidly\nincreasing interest in Recreation on\nfree flowing Rivers particularly in the\npedmont it is the pressure from these\nvery recreational activities that caused\nthis River to be saved 51 years ago and\nthat are causing us to visit this issue\ntoday\nthe decisions we make here today will\ndetermine the river if the river is\navailable for the citizens of Georgia if\nit will be lost to the\npublic the Flint River is truly special\nin in that it's Georgia's only really\nnatural River and one of only 40 rivers\nin the country that runs over 200 miles\nunimpeded the fact that it is unimpeded\nby dams makes it a remarkable sh bass\nhabitat in another ironic twist of fate\nwe're at another 50\nanniversary 50 years ago today the or 50\nyears ago this year the Georgia house\nattempted to move legislation to ask the\ncore of engineers to proceed with the\nreservoir project over the governor's\nobjections although this measure passed\nthe house thankfully the governor Carter\nwas able to stop this in the Senate and\nhe was again able to preserve this\nbeautiful River for the citizens of\nGeorgia hopefully this time for good\nPresident Carter assessed that saving\nthe Flint River to be the most\nchallenging task while he was governor\nsecond only to the complete\nreorganization of the government the\neffect of this was to cancel a\nhydroelectric Dam project in the middle\nof one of the worst energy crises this\nnation has known every single Chamber of\nCommerce affected oppos cancelling the\nreservoir project he also had to fight\nthe federal government I ask each of you\nto consider this as you bear the\npressure you feel from competing\ninterest concern with\nthis last year I sponsored house\nresolution 5 n this resolution was Rec\ncreated before this settlement between\nthe state of Georgia and the property\nowners on the Flint River and did not\ncontemplate this settlement I asked for\nthis committee because of the in in the\nissues that were developing on the Flint\nRiver with private land owners asserting\nrights over the river that I feel they\ndidn't hold this conflict as the whip\nsaid even escalated into gun violence uh\nwith a landowner serving a prison term\ncurrently I also asked for the study\ncommittee because Georgia law was vague\nand confusing and contradictory on\nfishing access before the passage of s\nsp115 the Georgia legislature hasn't\nacted on this topic since\n1863 the president or the picture on the\nboard here is President Roosevelt\nfishing at flash scholes near gay we\nhave to recognize that Roosevelt was the\npresident of the United States he didn't\njust whip out an iPhone and snap this\nshot it took a little work back then to\ntake a picture I feel that this location\nwas chosen above all others since it was\nan iconic public fishing spot this place\nwas also where the Oki Fuki path if I\nprobably said that wrong of the Creek\nIndian Nation crossed the Flint River\nsince the shs made a natural forward the\npublic has been on these shows since\nbefore the state of Georgia as we know\nit today we held the first Flint River\nor the first river access study\ncommittee a few miles from this location\nin gay Ruth Nash the mayor of gay gave\nthe first testimony at this hearing her\nfamily owned these very shs at one time\nshe recalled how every Saturday these\nshows were like the Six Flags of\nMerryweather County with the rocks of\nthe shs full of people of the community\nenjoying the\nriver since that time this stretch of\nriver has passed from her family's\nownership and the new owner has\neffectively barred the public from the\nriver here not long ago the Merryweather\nCounty tourism board under threat of a\nlawsuit was forced to remove any\nreference to fishing from all literature\ncreated from the newly created Flint\nRiver water\nTrail this River was set aside for the\ncitizens of Georgia 51 years ago growing\nup in fat County becoming an eagle scout\nin the Flint River Council spending my\nsummers at Camp Thunder and then\nretiring from the Army to Maryweather\nCounty this River has run through my\nentire life I reject the false narrative\nthat the Flint River is a private\nWaterway I know\nbetter at the center of this discussion\nis uh 448 5 the code section pertaining\nto rights of adjoining land owners to\nnavigable\nstreams uh it reads as used in this trap\nchapter navigable string means a stream\nwhich is capable of transporting boats\nloaded with Freight in the regular\ncourse of trade uh mirr rafting of\nTimber transporting wood shall not make\na stream navigable the discussion of\nthis law during the Committee hearing\nbecame a focus on how big the boat was\nthat the legislature was talking about\nat one point it was nothing less than a\ncoal barge being pushed by a tugboat and\ninterpreting this any St statute we must\nprume presume the general assembly meant\nwhat it said and said what it meant\ntoward that end we must afford the\nstatutory text that's plain and ordinary\nmeaning consider it contextually Etc\nthat's a passage from deal versus\nColeman 2013 I won't read the whole\nthing all that to say the general\nassembly did not say how lar how large\nthe boat must be it was important that\nthey would have if they thought it was\nimportant and we cannot regard that that\nthat specification to be uh\nan\nOmission although the law doesn't speak\nof boat size it does however speak in\nplain language to usage traffic it\nspeaks of transporting Freight for whole\nAP part of the year and it contrasts\nthis to occasional use of a river you\nknow with with floating logs and and\nrafting Lumber something a land owner\ndoes once in a lifetime the point is\nthat in 1863 when this statute was\npassed Georgia was in the middle of the\nCivil War history's first Total War\nwhere transportation and man\nmanufacturing became military targets\njust like formations on the battlefield\nwithin a year Atlanta would be under\nsiege the state was in a dire financial\nposition and our transportation\ninfrastructure was strained navigable\nWaters like any other thoroughfare had\nto be maintained this statute and my\nwhole point with all this this statute\ndirects resources to traffic just like\nthe general assembly does today and any\nother interpretation of this law ignores\nthe text of the statute the history and\nit also ignores the history and customs\nof our state\nanother I'll leave that out here let me\nI'm I'm going to cut my comments a\nlittle short because I don't want to run\nout of time\nuh so about a year after the passage of\nthis law the GE Georgia State uh\ngovernment appropriated funds to\nfacilitate navigability on the Flint all\nthe way up to Three Forks which is now\nbeneath the Atlanta airport whatever\nboat they had in mind could make it up\nthe Flint River all the way to that\npoint another example of river Commerce\non the pedmont can be found in the city\nof Campbellton in Campbell County uh\nthis count this the county seat uh was\nmoved to Fairburn in 1872 and this C\nCounty was absorbed into Fulton County\nin\n1931 this this this County Seat had no\nRailroad and relies solely on the\nchattah huchi river for comment for\nCommerce when this navigability statute\nwas passed uh the chattah huchi from\nfrom camton to the scholes north of\nColumbus is where cargo was freighted\nwhere it finished its trip by\nwagon the statute directed resources and\ninfrastructure to to traffic and in\naccordance with the statute and other\nlaws and criteria DNR has done just that\nin modern times with boat ramps on the\nFlint River being about four to 16 miles\napart from above flat shs at gay\nthroughout the river to Lake simol\nincluding the upper\nFlint I gave this historical context\nbecause another focus of the study\ncommittee became REM removing the public\ntrust Doctrine from s sp15 uh this\nDoctrine is found in English common law\nit's a fin it's a foundation of the\nNorth American wildlife management model\nand it's also stated explicitly in\nGeorgia Code relating to saltwater\nresources at the request of Industry\nstakeholders I consented to this\nremoval however this bill goes too far\nin other\nways\nfirst off we do have a pending lawsuit\non uh relating to\nsb115 it was filed by an adjacent land\nowner uh so so there is currently a\npending lawsuit uh that the state of\nGeorgia is defending on this issue we\nrisk passing a bill that changes law in\nthe direct that is the direct subject of\na pending\nlawsuit uh the bill also limits the use\nof navigable Waters in an unprecedented\nway never before seen in the history of\nthe state\nit differentiates what the public can do\non navigable Waters based on whether the\nproperty owner owns the stream bed or\nnot this requires the Boating public and\nfishing public to have a knowledge of\nproperty lines that they have no way to\nknow as they float Downstream we deal\nwith this same issue on our roadways we\nhave roads with deed rideways and others\nthat run across private property in the\ncase of roads without deed rideway the\npublic right to pass is based on the\nfact that the easement exist across\nprivate property a person driving down\nthe road cannot know who holds the deed\nof the property they're driving on and\nshouldn't have to care the road that I\nlive on begins as a deed rideway then\nturns into an easement then turns back\ninto a deed\nrideway only I know where the transition\noccurs because I I know what my plat\nlooks like and I pay the\ntaxes and yes I also you know just like\njust like the owners of submerged land\nin the state of\nGeorgia the difference is in recent\nyears our Rivers have become far more\nprecious than our dirt roads in the\nstate leading to this discussion in the\ngeneral assembly navigable waterways are\nthe original highways of the state of\nGeorgia and they should be treated that\nway so that we have Clarity and\nconsistency in the law let's not Tain\nthis process and limit access because of\nunlawful activities on Naval waterways\ninstead we should focus on what is Naval\nand what is not and exclude the public\nfrom plac that are not\nnavigable in closing I want to say that\ns sp115 was brought like all good\nlegislation to solve a problem it has\nbeen the law of the land for eight\nmonths and it really hasn't created any\nproblems uh as we consider HB\n1172 we need to also consider the other\nthings that this bill does other than\nremove the public trust doctrate from\nGeorgia\nlaw we need to focus on codifying a map\nof where the navigable Waters in the\nstate of Georgia lie so that Georgians\nknow specifically where they can navig\nwhere they can pass in the state of\nGeorgia uh I want to thank the whip for\nfor passing uh for dropping legislation\nto start that\nprocess we cannot deny that George is a\nvery different place than it was in in\n1863 when this legislation when this\nlegislature last visited navigability we\nhave to recognize that the Georgia\npopulation has grown and that that this\nissue does deserve the attention of this\nlegislature I urge you to vote no for\nhb1\n1172 and uh with that Mr Speaker I yield\nthe\nwell gentleman yield of the well\nrepresentative Scott is recognized to\nspeak to the\nbill\nokay thank you Mr Speaker you're good\ntake time today I stand before you to\nexpress my deep concerns about House\nBill\n1172 which aims to amend the chapter 8\nof title 44 of the official code of\nGeorgia annotated specifically targeting\nwater rights the beer proposes to remove\nreferences to the public trust Doctrine\nwhich is a fundamental principle\nprinciple safeguarding the interest of\nthe public in accessing and enjoying\nNaval streams let us delve into why this\namendment is detrimental to the rights\nof the citizens of\nGeorgia and the Integrity of our natural\nresources first and foremost the public\ntrust Doctrine rooted in the common law\nserves as a vital safeguard for the\ncollective interest of the people in\nassessing and utilizing Naval strings by\nremoving reference to this Doctrine HB\n1172 threats to undermine the\nlongstanding principles that Naval\nstreams are held in trust by the state\nfor the benefits of its citizens this\namendment essentially strips away the\nprotection that ensure our rights to\nfish hunt navigate and engage in\nCommerce along these waterways\nfurthermore this bill attempts to limit\nthe rights of Georgians by confining\ntheir access to Naval streams solely for\npassage hunting and fishing by doing so\nit disregards the multifaceted roles\nthese waterways play in our lives and\nlocal econom economies Nava stream\nserves as quarters for transportation\navenues for Commerce and vital\necosystems supporting diverse flora and\nfer to restrict The public's interaction\nwith these natural resources is to\nignore the integral role they play in\nour state's Heritage and economy\nmoreover by repealing laws that conflict\nwith this amendment HB level 72\ndisregards established regulations and\nlegal framework that have been put in\nplace to ensure the sustainable\nmanagement of our Water Resources this\nReckless disregard for existing\nlegislation could lead to Legal\nambiguity and disputes over water rights\nultimately jeopardizing the delicate\nbalance between Environmental\nConservation and economic development in\nconclusion House Bill 1172 possesses a\nsignificant threat to the rights of\nGeorgians to access and enjoy our Naval\nstreams by stripping away references to\nthe public trust Doctrine and limiting\nthe scope of our interaction with these\nvital waterways this amendments\nundermines the principle of equity\nsustainability and stewardships that\nshould guide our management of Natural\nResources I urge you to stand against\nthis misguided proposal and uphold the\nrights of the people to safeguard our\nwaterways for generations to come thank\nyou Mr Speaker and I yield The\nWell the lady has yielded well\nrepresenta long Tran is recognized to\nspeak to the\nBill thank you Mr Speaker today I Rise\nto speak against this bill\nif you take a look at lines 12- 15 it\nremoves the people's right to use and\nenjoy all navigable streams capable I'm\nnot going to read the entire thing for\nthe last nine years I have taken a CB\nScout Pack down to Flint River for them\nto Camp to\nfish and what I teach these kids is the\nair the water the fish the deer they\nbelong to Georgians they belong to the\nstate of Georgia for our use and our\nenjoyment this creates Confusion by\nremoving those lines the public Doctrine\nwe create an imbalance to line 16 which\nprovides a person who owns a crown Grant\nthis is pro going back to the the days\nof the monarchy you know we've had a\nrevolutionary war that should have taken\naway the rights and given the rights to\nGeorgians to use the air the water the\nfish and so I have very strict concerns\nwhen it comes to Georgians using our\nstreams if you've ever seen 10y olds 16y\nolds navigate our streams the boats can\nbe fairly large they can be very\nsmall now the kids I have taken down to\nFlint River they come from all kinds of\nbackgrounds different economic\nbackgrounds different ethnic backgrounds\nand one of my fears is the confusion\nthis law will allow a person to say that\nhe justifiably shot a kid just trying to\nenjoy our Parks because he believed the\nkid was trespassing I as a former scout\nmaster could not tell these kids what is\nnavigable and what is not this law\nis too confusing so with that I urge\nthis body to vote no on house bow 1172\nthank you Mr\nSpeaker gentleman has yielded the\nwell represented Mary margar Oliver is\nrecognized to speak to the bill\nrepresentative thank you Mr\nSpeaker I am a deep lover of the rivers\nrivers and waterways of Georgia I'm also\na person who's made aot long time\nobservation of the way in which this\nbody interacts with that Courthouse\nacross the street and we have had a\nlongstanding rule Unwritten rule but\nimportant rule that we do not interfere\nwith litigation that is ongoing about a\npolicy position that is very important\nand complicated to\nus the whip says that this bill is\nbrought forward to clarify the the\nrecent chaos of the courts and the\npassage that solves certain chaos by the\npassage of Senate\nbill5 I say to my colleagues that this\ndoes not clarify an important issue it\nfurther muddies an important\nissue I have uh spent most of of several\ndecades in private practice on the\nSquare indicator but all of my 20s I\nspent in North Georgia rural Georgia and\nin enjoyed almost every one of the\nnavigable rivers in a wide variety of\nrafting and kaying I rafted bull SLO on\nthe chatuga river and if you don't know\nwhat that is I'll tell you about it\nbecause it was an exciting day today\nlast 23 years I've owned property on\nfighten Town Creek in Fannon County\nfight and Town Creek is a very important\ncontributory of the aoi river known as\nthe TCO River as it passes from Georgia\ninto\nTennessee I have also spent most of the\nlast 10 years on the River Keeper Board\nof the alto Maha River so I have a\nlifetime of deep deep and Abiding Love\nfor these rivers and\nwaterways the issue that I want to bring\nto you is the way in which we are\nfurther muddying Waters that do not need\nto be muddied private shooting people on\nthe plint river is what began private\nlitigation that resulted in a settlement\nas the whip said where private property\nowners made a deal that served their\ninterest and in response the Georgia\nGeneral Assembly when that litigation\nwas over in\n2023 this body with the Senate came\nforward and passed Senate Bill 115 and\nwhen Governor Kim K signed that bill he\nwent to the trouble detailing why he\nsigned it and highlighted the\nsignificance of the rights of hunting\nand fishing Georgia's waterways and the\nInvestments of tens of millions of\ndollars that the state has made some of\nyou were here during Governor Sunny\nPurdue's fishing uh in Go Fish Georgia\nand that has been a significant economic\ninvestment we have\nmade the whip says that that litigation\nwas ended by the settlement but the new\nlitigation that we've talked about again\nis private property owners trying to sue\nthe state to recover some of the rights\nthat they believe they lost when we\npassed Senate Bill 115 the state of\nGeorgia has made a motion to dismiss\nthat lawsuit so that issue is pending in\ncourt right now we are Sweeping in and\ntrying to end that litigation in a way\nthat is going to further complicate and\nmake progress more\nmeaningful one of the things that\ndistresses me about the use of\n1172 is that it goes back and forth in\nmy judgment between the issues of\nfishing and hunting and the issues of\nnavigation and commerce the common law\nright of public Trust incl included\nCommerce and navigation and that is\nwhat's raised the complication of the\nissues about whether the kayaker that\nfalls out of her kayak can get on the\nproperty safely to save herself and\nperhaps her children that are with her\nwe are taking a step here despite an\nenormous amount of serious good work to\nfurther confuse the issue that I believe\nwas clarified by Senate Bill 115 with\nthe help of the governor was clarified\nwith\ndnr's progress following\n515 and taking a step that is\nunnecessary at this\ntime I am further concerned about let me\ngo back to us interceding in litigation\nthat's\nongoing I think that the interpretation\nthat private property owner is trying to\nmake in\ncourt uh that has been uh the state has\nmoved to dismiss is litigation if it was\nallowed to go forward would further\nassist in the strength that we brought\nforward to help fishermen and Hunters of\nGeorgia through Senate Bill\n115 this effort is not simple it is\nfurther muddying Waters that don't need\nto be muddied under a traditional\nrespect we have for not interfering with\nongoing litigation and I ask you to vote\nno on\n11772 for the purpose of giving further\nsecurity to the hunters and the Fisher\npeople of Georgia and also for the\nrespect that our governor has given to\nSenate Bill 115 thank you Mr speaker\nthank you representative Oliver the lady\nhas yielded the well that concludes\nthose opposed to the bill we'll now\nrecognize those in favor and we'll\nrecognize represent Al\nWilliams from down on the coast to speak\nto the\nbill representative Williams you're\nrecognized thank you Mr\nSpeaker um for reasons that some of you\nknow I was reluctant to come down today\nbecause of some things happened in my\npersonal life but it's certainly\nimportant I feel to speak to this\nbill\nnow I served on the study\ncommittee we went all over mostly North\nGeorgia and my first day there it just\noccurred to me when I was in my hotel\nroom that God has a great sense of\nhumor I thought about\nit said Lord back when the crown\ngrants and the state grants of\n1863 were\ndone I didn't have a shot at not one\npiece of this\nland I couldn't get me a piece of land\nand now Lord you've put me here to help\nmake a\ndecision and I got really\ntickled it was doubly as\nfunny being one of only two\nDemocrats represent Jackson and\nmyself I think at first I felt kind of\nlike the Indians felt when they owned\nall the land up\nthere must have been some kind of\nfeeling to leave that beautiful land and\ngo but they had to go they didn't leave\nvoluntarily so I had a lot of mixed\nemotions but you\nknow whenever you start talking about\nproperty\nrights there a lot of passion on both\nsides it's a passionate subject\nand I like to break things down Calvin\nschar used to say don't talk to the\ngiraffes talk to the goats and everybody\nwill understand it so in my SouthEast\nGeorgia\nway I have an analogy I live on Highway\n84 in Midway and those of you that live\ndown there know that Savannah is a\nbedroom community of\nMidway this I I thought somebody got\nthat after a while speak that's a joke\nthere y'all didn't get\nit\nbut where I live is exactly six\nmiles from where Interstate 95 crosses\n84 and in those six miles there is a\nMcDonald's on the left when you head my\nway you can buy a Big\nMac some french fries and whatever else\nand the\nmilkshake and the average person can\nfinish eating it by the time they get to\nmy\nhouse and every weekend when Liv and I\nget home the first thing we have to do\nis clean up the ditch with all the mess\nfrom\nMcDonald's and where it ends up does\nhappen to be private\nproperty I don't have a problem\nwith the rights everybody the air\ncertainty belongs to\nGeorgia the only thing is once you leave\nthe air and the stream that's not yours\nup on the\nbank and anybody that has ever been in\nanything public in Georgia knows how it\nlooks after people stop and enjoy\nthemselves very few people say let me\npolice this place up and leave it like I\nfound it\nhow would you like to own a home on a\nbeautiful stream and wake up every\nmorning having to clean\nup be safe navigable waters are open to\neverybody catch all the fish you want\nit's another thing that bothered me Miss\nspeaker while I was on this\ncommittee traveled everywhere saw some\nof the most beautiful trout in the world\nnever got a real piece of Trout the\nwhole\ntime\nthey got a little embarrassed up in Blue\nRidge and fixed me some trout drip dip\nand I ain't a dip E I wanted a piece of\nfried\nfish but how why is it so hard to\nunderstand that you would want the\nbeauty of your property preserved if you\nown lived on the\nriver navigable means the the ability to\nmove\ncommer\nunimpeded and the navigable\nriver those that want to enjoy it can\nenjoy it but it does not give you the\nright to move on to private\nproperty now I have\nnever you I didn't grew up living there\nand hadn't visited much and when repr\nJackson and I were in North Georgia you\ncan understand understand why I didn't\nvisit much didn't get many invites and\nsure didn't have nobody K to me up\nthere and as I sat around and looked at\nfolk fight over this navigable water and\nprivate property it wasn't very diverse\nup there either we didn't have a a local\nchapter of nacp up there so it it it was\npretty well established that when the\nIndians left that was the end of the\nminority folk so but I defend the right\nof those\nto have private property and the right\nto determine how it's\nkept we've gotten it all twisted we've\ngot we we can make anything I had a\nfriend of mine said wherever there's a\nmess he knew somebody that had a stick\nand when you start with a mess and\nyou're stirring it you got a bigger mess\nand land problems are a\nmess I could\nnot I don't like like having to stand\nhere in opposition to some of my most\nrespected members of the democratic\nparty the minority I don't like it but I\nserved on that committee and I did not\noppose the resolution of the committee\nand if I had opposed it I would have\nbeen the first to speak against it today\nbut I'm not a\nhypocrite I voted to move this Rec\nrecommendation forward into legislation\n115 needed some straightening and\nhopefully it will listen it's never\nreally going to be truly straight the\nonly thing more complicated than private\nproperty is Cosmetology in\nGeorgia It's just\ntough it's heavy lifting but I'm here to\nask you to think about the protection of\nprivate\nproperty and and and think\nabout me and po liby out there picking\nup McDonald's paper rappers on our\nproperty and when you do I would\ncertainly hope that you would move to\nvote Yes for\n1172 is a good piece of legislation it's\nnot the perfect answer but it's the best\nwe put forth so far with that Mr Speaker\nI yield the well\nthank you representative Williams we\nappreciate your\nviewpoints we do have a Minority Report\nbut is there any objection to the\nprevious question being\nordered chair is none the previous\nquestion is ordered we do have a\nminority report for up to 20 minutes\nrepresentive Stacy Evans is\nrecognized to speak to the Minority\nReport so you can plan your day members\nthen we'll have 20 minutes for the chair\ntime after The Minority\nReport thank you Mr Speaker good\nafternoon\ncolleagues I am here today to speak in\nopposition to House Bill\n1172 before I get into the heart of my\nremarks let's\nall think about a couple of things as\nI'm\ntalking why are we\nhere how did we get here what problem\nare we solving who are we helping and\nwho who might we be hurting we could\njust keep those questions in mind why\nare we here how did we get here what\nproblem are we solving who are we\nhelping who are we\nhurting stepping back Senate Bill 115\ncame to us because a landowner sued the\nstate and said he had exclusive rights\nto fish a certain area because he owned\na portion of the bed of the Flint River\nland owner Su the state only I can fish\nhere it didn't have anything to do with\nthe hilltop on the side of the beautiful\nRiver it wasn't about trash being left\non the hill it wasn't about people being\non that hill at\nall it was about people fishing in the\nriver fishing in the river and the\nlandowner said no only I have a right to\ndo that or only I have a right to give\nyou permission to do that that's what\nthe lawsuit was about landowner sues the\nstate\nit was also not because an\nenvironmentalist sued a landowner and\nsaid that they were using too much water\nfrom the river for irrigation or\nanything like that it wasn't it was the\nlandowner trying to stop people from\nfishing keep that in mind that case\nsettled just before s die last year and\nit led\nto understandable fear that other\nlandowners were going to do similar\nthings that they were going to bring\nother lawsuits to try to block block\npublic access to our streams in our\nRivers so enter Senate Bill\n115 Senate Bill 115 was a simple bill\nthere's not always simple bills this one\ncertainly isn't but Senate Bill 115 was\nit just stated that under the public\ntrust Doctrine the public retains the\nright to fish hunt and Transit our\nnavigable streams even where the title\nto the stream\nbed maybe belongs to a private party\nthat that private party has the bed but\nin public trust so you can own the bed\nand it's yours but you can't keep the\npublic from being in the water standing\non the bed while they're fishing um\nthings of that nature that's all it did\nso after we passed in a bill 115 it's\nbeen mentioned here there was another\nlawsuit by another landowner saying that\nthey own the bed of a river of the river\nof another section and also wanted to\nprevent public fishing there and\nchallenging Senate Bill 115 so again\nlandowner suing the state trying to keep\npeople from\nfishing not an\nenvironmentalist not somebody suing\nabout trash on the hill no no one no one\ndisputes that ladies and gentlemen none\nof these bills either s Bill 115 or this\nbill is about trying to keep people from\nwalking up the hill while they're\nfishing it's about being able to stand\nin the Stream perhaps maybe your fishing\npole hits the bottom of the stream bed\nwhile you're in the water\nso how did we get here so the study\ncommittee made the recommendation to\nremove reference to the public trust\ndoctrine that was really it from the\nstudy committee so anybody who is on the\nstudy committee and you want to stay\ntrue to what you did voting against\nHouse Bill 1172 doesn't make you a\nhypocrite because the study committee\njust said remove reference to public\ntrust Doctrine House Bill 1172 does so\nmuch more than that now even this public\ntrust Doctrine thing I don't really\nunderstand the concern there but I know\nthat the study committee wanted to make\nsure that farmers and everyone was\nsatisfied that this wasn't going to open\nthe door for environmentalists or other\nto others to sue them and say you're\ntaking too much water from the stream\nthe public trust says you can't do that\num there was a case in North Carolina\nthat folks were concerned about this\nfear was unfounded and we can talk about\nthose reasons but it doesn't really\nmatter no one I'm not opposed to\nremoving reference to the public trust\ndoctrine that would be fine um I don't\nknow anyone who's opposed to that really\nhonestly not not much\num what I am here to bring our attention\nto and what I want you to focus on is\nthe study committee says remove\nreference to public trust Doctrine just\nreemphasize that people have the right\nto go up and down these streams and fish\nand hunt and if they touch the bottom\nwhile they do it so be it no one's going\nto be mad but and you still don't you\nstill don't get to go up on the hill and\nno one's saying that do um but what 1172\ndoes is\nmore I was going to tell youall about\nall the reasons why the public trust\nDoctrine fears were really unfounded but\nyou don't need to know that because no\none's against it right so we're just\ngoing to move to what is the what else\nof\n1172\n1172 removes the Public's right of\nTransportation Commerce and navigation\non navigable streams that is in\nlines 12 through 15 you'll see those\nwords are deleted the only words that\never come back are hunting and fishing\nso that's why why did we do that no one\nhas has told us that house buillt\n1172 establishes that the public has the\nright of passage for fishing and hunting\non navigable streams even where tidle in\nthe beds is in a private it belongs to a\nprivate party but and this is the part\nthat's concerning if you if you would\nlook with me I know this can be a little\nlawyerly here so pardon me but lines 21\nto 23 if you could focus there for me\n1172 is trying to say that the public\nhas a right of passage for hunting and\nfishing on navigable streams even where\ntitle to the bed of the stream May rest\nwith a private party but then there's\nthis caveat language in lines 21 to 23\nthat says\nbut is limited only to using navigable\nstreams for passage and hunting and\nfishing and doesn't mention the right to\nstand on the stream\nbed now I doubt that I fish as much as\nmany of y'all in here but I don't think\nit takes a PhD in fishing to know that\nyou probably need to touch the stream\nbed to effectively fish so why are the\nwhy is is that caveat there to only talk\nabout the use of the stream but not the\nstream bed taken on its face the\nlanguage limits the right of passage and\nhunting and fishing to only using the\nwater but not the bed\nnow we've heard that this is not a big\ndeal because Senate Bill 115 didn't\nreally address the issue of stream beds\neither well I disagree with that but\nassuming for argument at best Senate\nBill 115 was silent on this 1172 is not\nsilent it has a specific carve out that\ngives you the right to the water when\nyou're fishing but not the\nbed\nwhy we heard at the beginning of the\npresentation here that we wanted to do\ntwo things today in 1172 eliminate\nreference to the public trust Doctrine\nokay fine again I'm not opposed to that\nthat's in lines uh 12 through 15 we can\ndo that but then we heard the second\nreason that we were here today for 1172\nwas to bring\nclarity about whether you can\ntrespass now I have read this bill 1172\nway more times than I ever cared\nto I don't see any and backing up the\nonly thing about trespass that I've\nheard up here today is that you can't go\nup on the hill and have a picnic can't\ngo and and take a take a nap I don't see\none word in how Bill 1172 to clarify\nthat the public has no access to the\nland to the left and the right of a\nstream I don't see that so the only way\nI can think of that 1172 clarifies where\nwe can't trespass is that it's got a\ncarve out that says I can be on the\nwater but I can't be on the bed that's\nthe only thing I can think of in 1172\nthat clarifies trespass so if you're on\nthe water if you stay on your boat on\ntop of the water you're probably fine\nfine but if your fishing pole hits the\nbottom or you get out and you've got\nyour waiters and you are touching the\nbottom I think you're going to be in\ntrouble so but if that's not the\ntrespassing that we're talking about\nthen why can't we get clarity in the\nbill that it's the stream bed and not\njust the water that's the question and\nI've been asking it since committee and\nI think it it it's helpful for for folks\nto have the full context here this bill\nbarely made it out of Judiciary\nCommittee there was a tie and the tie\nwas broken\nin favor of moving the bill along but we\nhad a lot of debate we heard from lots\nof people who enjoyed our favorite\npastime of hunting and fishing and\ntalked about how they wanted to have\nprotections then we heard from the\nGeorgia Wildlife Federation Georgia Farm\nBureau Georgia Forestry Association and\nGeorgia Agri Business\nCouncil I asked every one of the\nrepresentatives from those organizations\nwhat it was their members wanted to\nprevent that they didn't think was\nalready covered by Senate Bill\n115 the only thing I heard from any of\nthose fine gentlemen that are there to\nrepresent these\norganizations was public trust\nDoctrine so I come back\nagain why are we doing more and if we're\ntrying to\nclarify where we don't want people to\ntrespass why is there nothing in 1172\nthat talks about the hilltops\nthe only thing I can find again is that\ncar out that says you can be on the\nwater but it doesn't include the\nstreamed and I then I I'm always\nsearching for the why and I know I know\nso many of y'all are in here like that\nwe know that these organizations that\nI've mentioned are wonderful\norganizations I have the utmost respect\nfor them but we are all big boys and\ngirls in here and we know that these\norganizations always have the Sportsman\nside right they have the folks that are\num there to protect the nature side of\nof what these organizations are meant to\npreserve but in everything ladies and\ngentlemen there is a business\nside who wants to charge you who wants\nto make money off of our favorite\npastime hunting and fishing ladies and\ngentlemen that's what I think must be\ngoing on here today because otherwise I\ndon't know why we're not talking about\nthe hilltops I don't know why we've got\nthis carve out and I don't know why the\nChamber of Commerce has put a letter on\nyour desk urging you to vote for this\notherwise nature focused Bill Mr Speaker\nI yield the\nwell thank you\nrepresentative for yielding and your\npresentation now we have 20 minutes for\nchairs\ntime the chair of the committee from\nwhich this bill came chairman Gunther\nhas recognized to speak to the bill have\nup to 20 minutes or you can share thank\nyou Mr\nSpeaker well there's been a lot said\nabout the public trust Doctrine so I\nwant to address that\nfirst um Senate Bill 115 was rushed\nthrough the process it didn't appear\nuntil the last day in the last\nhours uh before it became came in here\nto us for us to vote on\nnot going through that process the bill\nwasn't properly\nvetted the term or phrase public trust\nDoctrine there's been a lot of\ndiscussion about that but what is the\npublic trust\nDoctrine there is some common law on it\nthere is some law Roman law on it from\nwhat period of time are you talking\nabout the public trust Doctrine and\nthere's 50 states out there that have\nsome sort of public Trust doctr\nout there which one does the state of\nGeorgia go look to to apply here that's\nthe problem with leaving public trust\nDoctrine in this language the courts\nwill fill that void by going somewhere\nelse looking for law to put in that and\nit didn't need to be that\nway that was the the reason for the\nremoval of the public trust\nDoctrine so what does this say\nwhat you can do what this bill tells you\nyou can do is you can go fishing on\nnavigable streams you can go hunting on\nnavigable streams although I'm not a\nhunter or a Fisher the only hunting and\nfishing I do is golf\nballs so with this you can go down the\nstream on a tube or a canoe or whatever\nkind of floating device you\nwant you can get out of that floating\ndevice and step onto the stream of the\nbed and you can fish as long as you're\ndoing it for passage hunting and\nfishing that's what this is this is all\nabout the navigable streams and what you\ncan do on it and if you look at\nit on line let's see we'll start at the\nend of 16\nwhere it says the general assembly\nfurther finds that by common law the\ncitizens of this state have an inherent\nright to use for passage and for hunting\nand fishing all navigable streams from\nlow water mark to low water\nmark So above the low water mark the\nadjacent land owners own that land you\ncan't trespass on\nthat if you have a grant a a a crown\ntitle or a state\nGrant you actually own the bottom of the\nriver the Tera\nFirma so this this is akin to an\neasement for the public they have the\nright to go on there for passage which\nmeans they can float through if they get\nstuck on a rock they can get out move\nthe boat and continue their their trip\nor they can do it for hting or\nfishing it is okay to trespass on the\nriverbed the Tera Firma\nthere as long as you do it for these\npurposes this bill simply\nclarifies what Senate Bill 115\nstarted and in my opinion created a big\nmess and that's why this bill is here I\nwould ask you for your support I think\nit's a good bill I think it helps\nclarify the law we still have the issue\nof\nnavigability that will come up later but\nthat is that is the I think the\nremaining big issue on\nthis discussion that we're having here\nso with that I'll yield the well oh and\nyield my time to the chairman Whit\nforette chairman has yielded the well\nthe remainder of his time to whip James\nbrette gentleman's\nrecognized thank you Mr Speaker and I\nwill be brief\nI just come up here and do uh the\nrebuttal right um and I've got to set\nthe record straight as I see it uh we\nhad a presenter present that the in\nlines 12 through 15 testified that we're\nremoving the right if you continue\nreading the bill 17 through 19 says\nassembly further finds that the common\nlaw by the common law the citizens of\nthe state have the inherent right to use\nfor passage and for hunting and for\nfishing all navigable streams from the\nlow water mark to low water mark so so\nwhere the gentleman is right we did\nremove the right we we just recited it\nin another part of the bill um this\nongoing litigation bar I'm not sure\nwhere the idea came from but uh a g lady\nwas um mistaken when she said that that\nlitigation had settled uh when we took\nup Senate Bill 115 Senate Bill 115 was\npassed last year the settlement for that\npiece of litigation just happened a week\nand a half ago or two weeks\nago and also I was submit to you all if\nwe didn't do anything that wasn't was\nunder litigation we wouldn't do anything\nin this house there we couldn't get\nanything done there there we couldn't do\nnothing there's so much litigation\nhappening around the state on so many\ndifferent issues we wouldn't get\nanything done here if we couldn't legisl\nover\nlitigation\num definition of cover um\nthe it was it was said up\nhere that this this this bill was not\nabout people on the hill and U I'm going\nto give my friend Grace um\nbecause she testified not being in the\nstudy committee and hearing the litigant\nsay the reason I'm bringing this\nlitigation is people standing drinking\ncamping on my property that is the\nreason the litigation was brought he he\nspecifically said that I don't care if\nthey float down the river but being up\non the hill just imagine this I'm going\nto paint you a very I'm not a good\npainter but I can speak it to you let me\npaint you a picture you're sitting in\nyour backyard on the Flint River with\nyour family and friends enjoying a\nSaturday having some sweet tea or water\nor whatever it is you drink and you've\ngot four or five of my good friends on\nyour bank in short cut off um jean\nshorts\nno shirt on drinking beer casting saying\nthe most uh you know talking like we\ntalk on the river uh can you imagine can\nyou imagine that I mean this is this is\nliterally about that I mean that's what\nwas the initiation of the litigation was\nso the litigant\ntestified lastly I want to I want to say\ncurrently the the way the law stands\nright now if we don't pass\n1172 if you're on a non non-navigable\nWaterway if you're floating fishing or\nhunting then you're doing it at the\npermission of the property owner this\ndoesn't change that doesn't touch that\narea law it doesn't it doesn't um remove\nany right\nthat's all right it was also said that\nthis bill says nothing about trespass\nand I want to direct\nyou because I'm a big fan of the words\non the page 24 and 25 nothing contained\nin this this subsection shall be\nconstrued to permit entry upon privately\nowned lands adjacent to the naval\nstreams specifically testimony was next\nto the streams adjacent to me means next\nto the streams you can trespass on that\nland folks we're over complicating an\nissue here we're reciting what the right\nis the right for Georgians to hunt fish\nand pass on navigable waterways even\nwhere someone has a a title pre1 1863\nyou still have the right to hunt fish\nand pass and with that Mr Speaker I ask\nfor your favor consideration and thank\nyou I yield the well gentleman has\nyielded the well that completes the\ndiscussion on house SP\n1172 is there an objection to the\nprevious

pink however we also\nfound that they cannot detect orange\neither so our determination was that\nthat this bill um would not negatively\nimpact uh those hunting who chose to\nwear the color pink

to\nbeneficiaries of a testate\nestate the gentleman from Elberton has\nrecognized to present the bill\nrepresentative Leverett thank you Mr\nSpeaker ladies and gentlemen uh this\nbill uh fits in with the old expression\nof why do we meet every year to fix the\nthings we messed up the year before 12\n18 is amending a statute that was\ncreated by House Bill 91 which we passed\nlast year that bill uh created a new\nsection in the probate code to deal with\nsituations or try to try to protect\nbeneficiaries of Estates when the\nexecutive that gets appointed absons\nwith the money it would require executiv\nto notify the beneficiaries when the\nexecutive is appointed uh the the main\nintent of the bill is still preserved\nbut the fiduciary section of the State\nBar and and the probate judges requested\ncertain changes to that statute to make\nit more effective and to strengthen it\nso under the the law as passed last year\nwhich is set out in the bill you can see\nthere parts of it are stricken the\nexecutive would have to notify\nbeneficiaries that the executive had\nbeen appointed within 30 days this gives\nthe executive more time but it it\npreserves the the the portion of the of\nthe existing law that says that the\nexecutive can be cited and fined or\nremove mood for failing to comply with\nthat requirement um we also uh try to\nclarify that notices don't have to be\ngiven if the beneficiary acknowledges uh\nthat the the beneficiary has been given\na notice so it it if the beneficiary\njust consents you don't have to go\nthrough the formality of a notice we\naddressed some other technical issues\nabout how you would notify a trust um\nand um we also again we extended the\ntime by which the executive has to\nreport back under the under the um uh uh\nold law it was affirmative Duty or it\nwas it was a procedural Rule now it's an\naffirmative duty of the executive so we\nthink this makes it stronger in and the\nprobate judges and the fiduciary section\nbelieve it's it's more workable within\nthe existing framework of probate\nproceedings so that's the gist to the\nbill um I will yield for any questions\nMr you have no questions thank you

for the\nCitrus commodity Commission in the\noriginal bill it defined a citrus\nproducer as someone that owns or\noperates at least five acres of citrus\nfruit bearing trees soon after the new\ncommission was formed they determined\nthat it would would be much easier for\nthem to\nquantify uh tonnage or weight as opposed\nto acreage so what this bill does is\nsimply remove the definition of what a\ncitrus producer is under the commodity\ntitle which is where it defined a citrus\nproducer by acreage and by doing this\nit'll give some flexibility to the\ncommission to spell out definitions of\nwhat is to be required to be a citrus\nproducer in the marketing order uh\nrather than in statute uh this method ex\nexactly mirrors that of the uh blueberry\ncommodity commission so overall a\ncleanup bill it adds some clarity and\nsome flexibility and it's something that\nsupports a growing industry for our\nstate's number one business that's the\npurpose of the bill Mr

representative\nNewton of the 127th and others to be\nentitled act to amend Article 2 chapter\n7 of title 48 of the official quod of\nGeorgia annotator relating the\nimposition rate computation exemptions\nand credits relative to income taxes\nthis bill have refer to the committee on\nways and means that committee recommends\nthat this bill do pass by committee\nsubstitute gentlemen from the home of\nthe Masters a Augusta GA representative\nNewton is recognized to present the\nBill thank you Mr Speaker colleagues I\nbring before you today uh House Bill\n1090 this bills on a foundation that was\nstarted a couple of years ago and the\nfostering success act we know that\nchildren that are in foster homes are\nsome of the most challenging situations\nacross our state that that are in such\nneed what we find out when we pass that\nbill is that their needs don't end when\nthey turn 18 and they're officially out\nof foster care so we do have the\nfostering success act today's Bill house\n1090 kind of augments and improves that\nprevious legislation it more clearly uh\nassists former foster children ages 8 to\n18 to 21 and it helps them make a\nsuccessful transition to adulthood um\nHouse Bill 1090 does that with three\nprimary items it cleans up language\nregarding eligibility of at risk youths\num who could benefit from this for\nexample um it allows uh youth who who\nturn 18 or or in who graduate from high\nschool say in May they're not attending\na vocational school until sometimes July\nor August so we changed attending to\nenrolled we're just trying to clean up\ndefinitions rather than leave kids out\nthere with no support no mentorship and\nno U uh assistance uh while they're\nwaiting a couple of months there in the\nsummertime things like that uh Second\nthing it does it it more clearly defines\nuh what mentorship is there's NE there's\nneed with nutrition with Transportation\nwith housing um so many things that are\nimportant but mentorship is a key part\nof this and so it more CL better\nclarifies what it means to be a mentor\nand to be in in Li of a parent the one\nwho can help these these young youth uh\nAdvance second thing it does it opens up\nthe definition a little bit of the types\nof uh corporations and entities that can\ndonate to this program there was a $20\nmillion maximum we didn't even raise\nhalf that with a regular income tax\nthere is a provision in here that allows\nsome companies that owe other things\nlike premium taxes to participate in\nthis program to help uh youth coming out\nof that um finally this bill does put\nsome guardrails around the spending of\nthis money there's a lot of great\norganizations that help foster children\nthe state itself has some great programs\nand some great individuals uh that we\nall know about that make such a\ndifference in these challenging\nsituations we wanted to put guard rails\nto where this is new money that doesn't\njust go for overhead somewhere but the\nbill specifies that at least 80% of the\nmoney will go directly to the children\nuh at least 80% hopefully more uh so so\nthat they can adequately get the care\nthey need I appreciate your support on\nthis we I think it's a good step forward\nI wish I could tell you about the\nexamples of kids that have been helped\nby this maybe we'll get to that one day\nI know representative Hutchinson does a\ngreat job with that with us but I'd\nappreciate your support Mr Speaker glad\nto answer any question gentleman has a\nquestion represent Kenard to your left\nis recognized for a

representative\nlever of the 123rd and others to be\nentitled act to amend title 44 of the\nofficial code of George an relating the\nproperty so as to provide for a transfer\non death Deeds this bill have referred\nto the committee on Jud Judiciary that\ncommittee recommends that this bill do\npass by committee\nsubstitute chairman L is recognized to\npresent the\nBill thank you Mr Speaker ladies and\ngentlemen House Bill 1247 is probably\none of the most seemingly boring bills\nthat will be of the most consequence to\nyou and your constituents this year it\nallows for a vehicle called transfer on\ndeath Deeds this was first to my\nknowledge proposed by representative Lim\nsome years ago and uh\nI think it's a great idea it basically\nallows you to execute a deed to provide\nthat real estate will pass to certain\nbeneficiaries at your death now you you\ncan there is a form of Deed by which you\ncan do that now it's basically conveying\na remainder interest in reserving a life\nestate with a power of sale and a right\nto counsel and revert but that takes a\nbit of time and a bit of complexity to\ndraft in this code section the the the\nthe the statutory framework is\nestablished where you can execute the\nthe deed and the form of the deed is set\nout in code you can change the\ndesignation or you can revoke the\ndesignation and there's a process by\nwhich the beneficiary can accept at your\ndeath so this this simplifies it it\nstreamlines it and it's much more\naccessible to people it it provides them\nwith a will substitute when they may not\nhave sufficient funds to pay for estate\nplanning or Preparation of what is a\nfairly complex sophisticated deed so I\nwould recommend it to you highly I think\nit's a great consumer uh protection and\na great consumer Advantage it's a it's a\na good vehicle to provide for your\nconstituents and it provides them an\nalternative when they might not be able\nto afford a more intensive kind of\nestate plan so I would uh request your\nfavorable consideration this bill and I\nwill be glad to answer any\nquestions gentleman has a couple of\nquestions if you yield yes I'll yield\nrepresentative Reese

you can't revoke the conveyance by\na will and the will would take precedent\nwhich It generally does if you if you\nmake a lifetime transfer of property\nthat you have left to someone in your\nwill the gift is considered a deemed\nit's it just kind of lapses and goes\naway the same effect here so you would\nhave you would have to execute another\ndeed or a change of of\ndesignation thank you I hope some other\nfolks understood that but an\nidea that was some of that legal legal\nstuff right there I'm talking about the\nanswer to your question Mr chairman is\nyes now that's the kind of

1100 by\nrepresentative new the 64th and others\nto be entitled an act to amend title 40\nthe official Cod to George annotator\nrelating to motor vehicles and traffic\nso as to authorize the use of

that\ncommittee recommends that this bill do\npass by committee substitute I think the\nlady knows a little bit about this\nsubject matter doesn't she she certainly\ndoes representative kimly new is\nrecognized to present the\nBill thank you Mr Speaker colleagues I\nappreciate the opportunity to talk to\nyou today about\nhb110 this is an H agcy bill for the\nDepartment of Revenue the motor vehicles\nthis bill does four things number one it\nallows the Department of Revenue and the\nDepartment of Driver Services to send\nelectronic notices or emails to\ncustomers who choose to opt in to\nreceive notices customers like me\nwishing to Pro to continue to receive\npaper notices can still do that it is an\nopt-in option only number two it\nclarifies that all vehicles titled to a\ngovernment entity will have a plate\nlabeling it is a government\nvehicle this does not apply to law\nenforcement Vehicles this is for\ntransparency in tax dollars number three\nit allows trailers to be included in the\ndefinition of Fleet for vehicles that\ncan have the registration renewed in\nbulk so the definition a fleet is that\nyou have a 100 Motor Vehicles or more so\nthis is uh would speed up the renewal\nprocess\nfor those entities to renew their Fleet\nand that is like uul Avis those are the\nindividuals the entities that would be\nable to do so the fourth thing it does\nis to provide statutory Authority for\nthe Department of Revenue to allow\nelectronic transfers of titles it's\nsetting the foundation for the future of\nGeorgia for E tiing other states are\nalready moving towards paperless title\nand this would set us the the foundation\nfor the future for us to do the same\nthis this is what the bill does I would\nask for your favorable consideration if\nthere are no questions lady has a couple\nof questions if you only yield I will\nrepresentative hugley to your left has a\nquestion representative hugley thank you\nMr Speaker does the gentle lady yield I\nwill just a point of clarification so\nyou're saying all government vehicles\nhave to have a government tag if unless\nthey're law enforcement is that what\nyou're saying that is\ncorrect well does the general lady\nfurther yield I yield isn't it true that\nsome officials have taken the government\ntag off for their safety and they're and\nthey've gone to just regular tags so\nthat they won't be identified or\nharassed as they move around uh the city\nor the state so that's that's a concern\nthat I would have is that not true so\nthis is for transparency and tax dollars\nso taxpayers are paying for that vehicle\nand so that way the the uh taxpayer will\nknow that that is a government vehicle\nyes does the general lady further yet\none more time one more question yes\nma'am let me just bring it home for you\nokay isn't it true that my husband is\nthe city manager of the city of Columbus\nGeorgia they took off his government tag\nfor his safety and gave him a regular\ntag and you're saying that they're going\nto have to go back and put the\ngovernment tag back on is that is that\nthe correct understanding that does\ncover the scope of this bill but I will\nsay you probably do have a personal car\nthat he could probably\nuse lady yield for another\nquestion can I yield the well sir you\nmay yes lady yield The Well the lady is\nyielded the well is there any objection\nto the

chairman\nMitchell\nrise Mr Speaker isn't it true I wish\nthat the lady would have remained in the\nwell so that I could ask the\nquestion isn't it further true that\njudges clerks and others in the times\nthat we live\nin would have to display their\ngovernment cars\nDas uh there is a bill that is working\nits way through the legislative process\nnow that would remove their ability to\nlist their personal property and and\nsome of us this if this bill were to\npass those judges Das and the like would\nhave to display their government\ncars I'm sure the gentleman knows what\nhe speaks and

vessels show as\nrevised penalties for failing to remove\nan abandoned vessel this bill have\nreferred to the Committee on Public\nSafety and Homeland Security that\ncommittee recommends that this bill do\npass by committee\nsubstitute representative Petri from\ndown on the coast is recognized to\npresent the bill chairman Petri thank\nyou Mr Speaker and I think we have a uh\nvisual aid here folks uh ladies and\ngentlemen I bring you today House Bill\n957 this bill was uh is brought to you\nby myself and co-sponsored by my entire\nCoastal delegation in this in this\ncaucus this bill deals with abandoned\nand derel vessels so just let me uh tell\nyou a little bit about the problem uh we\nhave a multitude of abandoned vessels in\nGeorgia waterways today there are\ncurrently according to\nDNR 59 abandoned vessels you see some\nexamples here on the Georgia coast there\nare 38 abandoned in vessels in Georgia\nLakes about half of these are sunken\nsome are uh some are above water some\naren't but as you can imagine they are a\nreal risk to Public Safety in terms of\nnavigating public waterways it cost the\ndepartment about 32 to\n$42,000 to remove some of these as you\ncan imagine and that burden is now borne\nby taxpayers and we don't really have a\nline item for such removals in the first\nplace so to date what you need to know\nis this to date the department has not\nfound a path to hold people accountable\nfor this my friends people are floating\nvessels down here from other states and\nfloating them off into the sunset in my\ndistrict between sessions this year we\nhad a vessel from New Jersey that was\nfloating in the Skidway River the guy\nfloated it down here from New Jersey and\nliterally just walked away and left it\nthese are vessels that have no value\nthey're barely uh uh worthy of floating\nany longer and rather than deal with\nthem appropriately they just float them\noff into the high Marsh or in some cases\nsink them in the channel this is a huge\nproblem for the Department what this\nbill does very simply is once and for\nall fix this problem this creates a\npenalty it creates a criminal penalty of\na misdemeanor in a high and aggravated\nnature first offense second offense a\nfelony and further it allows DNR some\nother measures you'll see in here allows\nthem to revoke revoke vessel fishing\nlicenses and it allows the department of\nrevenue for an individual that does this\nto revoke an automobile Li a driver's\nlicense much as we do with uh some of\nthe other abandoned issues with uh cars\non highways so uh uh to my colleagues\nhere today this is a uh an issue of\ngreat importance to us on the coast um\nthere is an exception you'll see in here\nthat came from the wisdom of\nRepresentative Jaspers in the in a state\nof emergency where you have a hurricane\nthere's an exception for that and uh Mr\nSpeaker I think that fairly explains the\nconundrum and I'm glad to answer any\nquestions you have a coastal question if\nyou'll accept it yes sir Mr Speaker glad\nto down the coast view chairman Saints\nto your left thank you Mr Speaker does\nthe gentleman yield yes sir I yield is\nit not true that this will allow some of\nour friends in our Coastal delegation to\navoid sandb bars because they're not as\ndistracted by abandoned vessels I think\nthat's fair I think that's very fair\nyeah one last question to representive\nFranklin right out in front of you to\nyour right has a question thank you Mr\nspeaker thank you is it not true that\nI'm a ship's Captain yeah is that's my\nunderstanding

of the 46th to be entitled an act\nto amend article 7 of chapter 20 of\ntitle 47 of the official code of Georgia\nanotated the public Retirement Systems\ninvestment Authority law so as to\nprovide for a fiduciary duty to invest\nretirement assets this bill have\nreferred to the committee on retirement\nthat committee recommends that this bill\ndo pass by committee\nsubstitute chairman of the committee on\nretirement chairman Carson is recognized\nto present the\nBill thank you Mr Speaker and I know the\nhour is getting late House Bill 41 all\nthis does is codify the uh fiduciary\nduties and investment policies as set\nforth by our Employee Retirement system\nand the teacher retirement system these\nuh fiduciary rules were adopted by their\nrespective investig committees in\nSeptember of 22 and adopted by the board\nformally in October of 22 all it does is\nmandates that fiduciaries execute their\nduties solely in interest of plan\nmembers and beneficiaries it ensures\nthat every decision they make regarding\nretirement assets is made with the\nwell-being of those individuals in mind\nit requires judiciaries to vote and\nexecute on all voting proxies in the\nbest interests of the investors it um\nvery simple just codifies the board\nrules that are already been in place for\nthe past year and a half and it\nrepresents a step forward and ensure the\nintegrity and security of our State\nRetirement Systems and that all that's\nall the bill does Mr\nSpeaker with that I will yield for a\nquestion if there is one and if not I\nwill yield the well you have no\nquestions thank you Mr Speaker I yield\nthe well we do have a couple of members\nthat are opposed to the bill bill that\nhave requested time to\nspeak per the\nrule from the rule rules committee we\nhave up they have up to 30 minutes we'll\nrecognize repes representative Sandra\nScott to speak to the bill\nrepresentative\nScott thank you Mr\nSpeaker today I stand before you to\nvoice my opposition to House Bill\n481 a bill purply aimed at safeguarding\nretirement Assets in Georgia while the\nbill claims to prioritize the financial\ninterest of retirees it fails to\nrecognize the broader implications and\nrisk associated with the\nprovisions first and\nforemost House Bill 481 seeks to ensure\nretirement assets are managed solely in\nthe financial interest of participants\nand\nbeneficiaries while this may sound\nappealant on the surface it neglects the\nreality that retirees have diverse needs\nand interests that extend beyond\nFinancial\ngains by focusing solely on financial\ninterest this bill could restrict\ninvestment opportunities that may align\nwith retire\nvalues and social\nwell-being furthermore the bill\nimpulsing stringent fiary duties\nmandated fiduciaries to act prly and\ndiversify Investments to minimize risk\nwhile prudence and diversification are\ncrucial the bill fails to acknowledge\nthe potential administrative burden\ndisplaces on\nfiduciaries the increas increased\nbureaucratic herders could hinder timely\ndecisions making and limit the agility\nneeded to navigate Dynamic market\nconditions\neffectively additionally House Bill 481\nprohibits sacrificing investment returns\nfor non financial interest such as\nsocial or political agendas while\nFinancial returns are undoubtedly\nimportant so too are the ethical and\nsocietal implications of in investment\nDecisions by prioritizing Financial\ngains Above All Else the bill ignores\nthe potential for Investments to\ncontribute positively to societal\nprogress and environmental\nsustainability moreover the bills allows\nfor the delegation of investment\nmanagement to qualify professionals\nwhile expertise is valuable delegating\nsuch responsibility introduce\ncomplexities and accountability and\noversight there is a risk that fidu\nfiduciaries may abdicate their\nresponsibilities without adade adequate\nscrutiny potentially exposing retirees\nto undo risk or conflict of interest in\nconclusion House Bill 481 fails to\nstrike a balance between financial\nprence and broader societal interest it\nemphasized on Financial gains overlooks\nthe holistic well-being of retirees and\nthe community at large therefore I urge\nyou to cons reconsider this bill and\nadvocate for legislation that prioritize\nthe comprehensive needs and values of\nGeorgia retirees thank you Mr Speaker\nand I yield the\nwell lady as yield of the well\nrepresentative Jasmine Clark is\nrecognized to speak to House Bill 481\none representative\nClark thank you Mr Speaker today I Rise\nto express my concerns about House Bill\n481 and to ask you to vote no on House\nBill\n481 specifically at lines 39 through 40\nthis bill points out that Pension funds\nor fiduciaries for pensions cannot um\nand they cannot consider non-pecuniary\ninterests or Financial I had to look\nthat word up myself um but shall um and\nthese non-pecuniary interests include\nthings like social political or\nideological interests and so whenever\nthere is anything in a bill or law\nthere's usually a reason for it so I\nasked myself why why were these words\nspecifically written into this bill why\nwould we specifically not want um\npension or fiduciaries for pensions to\nconsider these\nthings and I found some remarks from the\ncommittee um the committee testimony on\nthis bill from a Libertarian lobbying\norganization in which they accuse\nactivists and elected officials of\npressuring public pensions to invest or\ndivest from specific companies or\nIndustries so this is an overly\nsimplistic view that has the potential\nof actually limiting options for\nalternative Investments for Georgia\npensioners based on the assumption that\nit is for reasons other than financial\nreasons it is not Poss it is not it is\nis is it not possible that divestment\nfrom certain industries can be both a\ngood financial decision as well as good\nsocial policy and if so who decides who\nis going to decide what how these\nfiduciaries are acting who gets to be\nthe final Arbiter on whether an\ninvestment is non-pecuniary or not for\nexample many investment firms consider\nenvironmental social and corporate\ngovernance criteria also known as ESG as\na part of their decisions on investment\nthis do not mean it is the sole criteria\nit is a part of the criteria that they\nconsider and if you take this into\naccount that does not necessarily\ndecrease the total number of potential\nalternative Investments however the bill\nthat we are voting on today does have\nthe effect of taking certain alternative\nInvestments off the table lest an\ninvestment company be accused of pushing\na quote woke\nagenda additionally sometimes divestment\nis the right thing to do do for example\nin 2022 our government decide or our\ngovernor decided to divest from Russian\nfirms after Russian's aggressive\ninvasion of Ukraine this bill would take\noptions like that for Georgia to stand\non its values it would take those\noptions away we could be en forced to\ncontinue investments in firms and\ncountries committing acts that we do not\nagree with why would we want to tie our\nhands this\nway lastly this is an essentially an\nanti-climate change Solutions\nBill if you live anywhere in south\nGeorgia or places where you have been\naffected by things like hurricane then\nyou know that climate change unaddressed\nhas the potential to cause devastating\neffects on our economy increased\nflooding severe storm STS drought can\ncost communities lots and lots of money\nso considering the impact of climate\nchange in our state's in retirement\nportfolio is very much a financial\ndecision for our state we should be\ndoing the absolute most to make sure\nthat our alternative Investments are\ngoing to give pensioners a good return\non investment when they retire labeling\ncertain Investments as quote woke or\nassuming that certain Investments or\ndivestments are based solely on\npolitical activism risk causing\npensioners to not get as much as they\ncould and even possibly lose\nmoney I vote I urge you to vote no on\nthis legislation because we should not\nbe using this chamber and we should not\nbe using the law to decide who it who\ngets to be uh who who we get to invest\nin for um our pensioners and with that\nMr Speaker I
