to our subcommittees and\nsubcommittee\nchairs that have spent hours upon hours\nupon hours working on this budget you\nhave before you this afternoon\nthank you to the governor's office and\nopb for their work on sharing\ninformation and helping us understand\nwhat it was that they had done in their\ninitial par portions of the budget\nbut\ncertainly not least\nis our house budget and research office\nstaff\nand i like it that they're coming in in\na parade here now\nbut\ny'all\nyou all know\nand have seen\nthese young folks\nscattered around this capitol every day\nand\nthe work that they continuously do\nthroughout the year\nand would it not be for them we would\nnot be able to have this budget laying\non your desk\nthat is grammatically and numerically\ncorrect\nand\njust the the hours that they spend on it\nmartha and christine\nare constantly running all of the rest\nof the crew is constantly running and\nthat's exactly what they're doing right\nnow is running to get over here\nyou can see who the younger and faster\nones are i guess\nor maybe they were just closer in the\nbuilding but\nyes i know i'll pay for that later i'm\nsure\nthe 30.2 billion dollar budget that you\nsee in front of you today\nrepresents a 10.8 percent increase over\nlast year\nand what a difference a year makes\ni'm not going to take a whole lot of\ntime here on the front end to talk about\nthe economy or the usual contextual\ninformation\nthat we share to introduce a budget\nbecause i cannot wait to walk you\nthrough\nthe end product of your work\nyou can look at the size of this\ndocument tell that the members of the\nsubcommittees worked as teams to\nconstruct a deliberate and thoughtful\nplan\nfor funding the future\nour future our state's future\nas we walk through the budget i have\nfour key thing\nthemes that i want you to remember\ntrust funds\nthis is the premier budget reflecting\nthe nine dedicated revenue streams put\ninto the new budget structure via house\nbill 511 from last year\nthe agricultural trust fund the\nhazardous waste trust fund the fireworks\ntrust fund the solid waste trust fund\nthe state children's trust fund the\ngeorgia transit trust fund the\ntransportation trust fund and the trauma\ncare trust fund\nalong with the wildlife endowment trust\nfunds are presented with transparent\nearnings and where they are statutorily\nrequired to be spent\njust look at the revenue cover page of\nyour tracking document on page 37 and\nthe governors of the governor's budget\nbook\nto access that information easily\nand and\nhistorically but also for your reference\ntoday\neducation education is always our number\none priority\nk-12 appropriations sets an all-time\nrecord level of state funding at\n11.8\nbillion dollars\n11.8 billion dollars\nfor the most important investment this\nstate has\nqbe is fully funded and teachers and\ncert certificated personnel get the last\ninstallment of their promised five\nthousand dollar raises at a cost of two\nhundred ninety one point seven million\ndollars which together with nearly two\ntwenty million in an increase in pre-k\nteachers gives us an investment of over\n300 million in this one item alone\nin higher education we addressed\naffordability and provided enhancements\nfor scholarship amounts as well as\nfunding on just under 230 million to the\nuniversity's teaching formula\nas tuition to replace operating funds\nderived from student fees initiated over\na decade ago\nsalary increases\nnearly every single program in this\nbudget including includes the first cola\nfor including a first cola for state\nretirees in 14 years\nputs forth an increase to address the\nliterally hours of testimony regarding\nstate workforce needs and the\ncompetition to retain its staff\nthe five thousand dollar cola\nlifts the entire workforce and accounts\nfor roughly six hundred and ten million\ndollars and in the house version as a co\nis accompanied by an additional targeted\nincreases where turnover is crippling\nour ability to perform the very core\nservices that a state should provide\nour correctional officers in the\ndepartment of juvenile justice and\ndepartment of corrections\nleave at a rate that sometimes reaches\n90 percent\nin that same vein behavioral health\nstaff at our state hospitals nurses and\naides\nwho care for those with mental health\nissues and criminal histories\nhave a collective turnover rate of just\nover 50 percent\nwhich directly impedes the number of\nbeds that we can provide to allow for\ntreatment\nwe've asked public health nurses\nto be our front line in the coved army\nto go into homes and clinics to provide\nsafety net care but but because the\ndemand for nurses is so high\ncompensation competition from private\nentities has spiked an irresistible\nopportunity for them to leave\nand while the increases of these types\nof jobs have significant emotional\nappeal there are areas of state\ngovernment where the turnover affects\nour ability to operate at the uppermost\nlevel of efficiency\nand the need to stem the turnover in\nthese positions appeals to our sense of\nfiscal responsibility\nfor example this body wanted\ntransparency in spending is just as we\nnoted a while ago\nwith the trust funds but we need our\nauditors to help guarantee that the\ndepartment is paying anywhere from 12 to\n33 percent below other state and local\ngovernments\nthe house version deliberately targets\nmarket raises to higher turnover jobs\nand we've added almost 28.7 million for\ncorrectional officers 16.3 million for\npublic health nurses 20.2 million for\nbehavioral health nurses and aids and\nadjustments for state auditors epd\nengineers death investigator specialist\nand metro atlanta troopers and more\nthe growing magnitude of this issue\ncompelled us to request a market study\nor salary market study through the human\nresources division of the department of\nadministrative services on line 12.5.2\nsalaries as a recruitment retention tool\nare fortified by enhancements to the\nstate's benefit package\nabout 154 million to provide retirement\nand leave adjustments\nin total the house version of the fy23\nbudget uses a third of all new funding\nto reinvest in taxpaying georgians who\nare\nour workforce\nmajor policy investments are included\nlaw enforcement in addition to the\nsalaries we discussed this document\nembodies the criminal justice reform\npackage that we've been working on and\nexpands access and success of the\naccountability court model\non your desk under chairman's hitch\nchairman hitchens card you have a\nsummary\nnecessary and helpful because the\ncomprehensive and visionary approach we\nare taking to strengthen these\nsuccessful components across our entire\nlaw enforcement spectrum\ndirect investments of over 65 million\nthat will have indirect savings in\ninvestigation and evidence processing\ntimes\naccurate evidence officer training and\ncounseling and the list goes on\nour efforts to delineate the proper\nplacement of persons involved in legal\nand correctional systems because of\nbehavioral health issues\nis part of that vision and having\nappropriate and quality placement and\ntreatment options go hand in hand with\nlasting positive outcomes\nso it brings me to behavioral health as\nwe emerge from the years\nof the us department of justice\noversight and building our\ninfrastructure the need continues to\ngrow\nand thankfully the stigma is starting to\nshrink yes we are stringing the pearls\ntogether\nfor legally related\nfar legally related interactions and\nbehavioral health but there is a high\ndemand for all of us to have access to\nservices\nfor some it may be one time for others\nit may be a lifetime\nthe second summary on your desk under\nchair lady dempsey's card is a road map\nof the new funding\nthat in some instances blends with law\nenforcement but is comprehensive and\naddressed in multiple agencies and\ntotals nearly 100 million dollars in the\nongoing stabilization\nand\nstriving to expand capacity for access\nto for services to all georgians\nso if you will take out your tracking\ndocument and you'll find on your desk as\ni mentioned just a second ago\nthe\nkind of briefs from chairman hitchens\nand from\nchair lady dempsey you'll also find a\nvery helpful graphic as it relates to\ntransportation funding\nand i strongly recommend that\nand and actually it's one of the the\nbest ways i've seen to understand how\nour transportation funding formula works\nin the state and you'll also find under\nmy card\na copy of the budget highlight so\ni just want to make sure that you know\nthat those things are already on your\ndesks so if you will take out the\ntracking document we'll run through it\nso under the georgia senate there are no\nchanges\nunder the georgia house representative\nyou'll see the annualization of the\ncolas for our employees\nalso the 40 hours of earned annual leave\nto allow our employees to take that and\nadjustments to the employment employee\nretirement system so there'll be state\nchanges that are common throughout the\ndocument i will not\nnote each one of those as i come to\nthose\nso under the joint offices of the\ngeneral assembly\nyou'll see one addition there\n3.1.6 for legislative operations an\nincrease in price there for our lexus\nnexus contract\nto allow accessibility for us to be able\nto look at code and for our constituents\nto be able to look at code\nunder 3.1.7 just removing some one-time\nfunds there\nmoving on to audits and accounts and\ni'll remind you again that under audits\nand accounts audits and accounts is\nactually a sort of a branch of the\ngeneral assembly so we have to make all\nthe changes there the governor\nloads what they send to them but\notherwise any changes we load\nthen moving on to\nuh 4.1.8 you'll see that one actually\nmoves over in just a second to line\n4.3.1\nthe reduction of some one-time funds at\n4.1.9\nand then just asking for ongoing work\nand utilizing existing funds at 4.1.10\nfor an audit of the spending of the arp\ndollars across the state\n4.3.1 you'll see the item that was moved\nfrom earlier under the court of appeals\nagain the statewide changes and things\nthat we have to add or delete there\nbecause the governor and the governor's\noffice opb cannot\n5.1.4 you'll see an increase in funds\nfor per diem adjustments\nas our per diem increases with the\ngeneral assembly their their per diem is\nis tied to ours so we have to do an\nincrease there eliminating funds for the\none-time development of the case\nmanagement system there's a reduction\nthere\nand you'll look over at 5.2.6 and 5.2.7\ntrue up at 5.2.6 in relation to the cola\nand on 5.2.7 just saying no to that\nadditional\njudicial assistant\nunder judicial counsel section 6.\nrestoration at 6.4.1 of some operating\nfunds that we'd had to reduce in\nprevious years\nmoving on then\nto juvenile courts no changes there\nprosecuting attorneys\nyou'll see it eight point two point\ntwelve thirteen and fourteen\nfunds for one additional assistant d.a\nin the three circuits that are being\ncreated this year\nat 8.2.10\nyou'll see four additional assistant\nda's for the juvenile courts and the\nbill forsyth chattahoochee northern and\nand patula\njudicial circuits that's part of our\nhouse law enforcement package\ni'll also note that at 8.2.6 and 8.2.7\nare two additions there that are part of\nthe leo package as well\nyou'll see some\neliminations of funds on things that\nwere put in before they were aware that\nthe five thousand dollar cola was going\nout so we've made those true adjustments\nthere\n8.3.10 still under prosecuting attorneys\nyou'll see an adjustment for the payroll\nspecialist position and then elimination\nof the funds\nfor our prosecutor position that's not\nneeded just at this time under superior\ncourts\nyou'll see a few changes at 9.1.4\n9.2.5 and a couple of other places those\nare replaced because of the 5 000 cola\nso they were not necessary at\n9.3.16 you'll see where we're bringing\nthe law clerks up to a fifty thousand\ndollar uh rate or pay rate and\nthe five thousand dollar cola was\nalready included prior so it allowed for\na reduction there of added funds\nunder the supreme court\nat 10.1.9\nyou'll see an adjustment there for the\ntrooper that is assigned to the superior\ncourt to incorporate the five thousand\ndollar colas for them\nand then you'll see a couple of other\nadjustments\nand at 10.1.3 we're seeing just one\nposition instead of two\nunder state accounting office\nmost of the state accounting office and\ndepartment of administrative services\ndoeas\nare\nfunded through state funds\nso those are considered other funds and\nso it makes a little tricky when you do\na a cola like we've done\nfor all state employees\nand so we're kind of having to back into\nthe door just a little bit different\nthan we do in other state agencies\nbecause typically this would be spread\nthroughout all agencies and so what\nyou'll see here in sao\nis the spread within sao instead of\nthrough all other agencies under the\nstate board of accountancy at 11.6.4\nyou'll see the addition for one new\nauditor that is needed there\nsection 12 again\nunder department of administrative\nservices\nunder 12.2.2\nare the two compensation resolutions\nthat we passed out of our committee\nyesterday\nand if those are actual fine final\npassage then we will fund those when we\nget together for conference or if the\nsenate passes the budget or passes them\nbefore they get to the budget may be\nadded then\n12.3.2 you'll see an addition for the\ngeorgia aviation authority\nto cover uh some travel\nthen under section 13 department of ag\nmost of what you see here are true ups\nuh\n13.1.3 you'll see an addition uh to do\naway with the austerity reduction at the\nathens and tifton vet labs\nbut you'll see also true ups at 1321\n1327 1331\nmoving on to 1341\nis also adjustments at 1351 you'll see\nan increase from maintenance cost at the\npoultry vet diagnostic lab\nand then down at the soil and water\nconservation committee at 1376\nand 1377 those two items kind of go\ntogether because it pertains to the\nsoil and water conservation commission\nbut you'll see that we're adding\nadditional funds for each of the\nconservation districts around the state\nand then adding some regional managers\nand technical specialists so\nany land disturbance activity of over\none acre in size in the state of georgia\nhas to have an erosion a sediment\ncontrol plan for it\nand so the georgia soil and water\nconservation commission and those local\ndistricts are in charge of making sure\nthat those plans are submitted and\napproved and so\nwe need to make sure that they're able\nto do that job banking has no changes\nunder section 15 department of\nbehavioral health\na lot of work went in here and as i\nmentioned in my opening comments about\nuh a lot of the things that we're doing\nfor behavioral health you're going to\nsee mo a lot of those manifest\nthemselves here within this budget\nat 1528 though is one kind of outside of\nthat realm as it deals with the now in\ncomp waivers\nwe're adding an additional to the\ngovernor's 100 proposed in his budget\nwe're adding an additional 225 slots\nand an additional administrative\nposition to help manage those slots\nfor those needed across the state\nso we're very happy about that chair\nlady dempsey and her subcommittee were\nvery passionate about making that happen\nas well\nto 10\ndeals with our our developmental\ndisability providers many of you heard\nfrom those folks early on about needing\na rate increase we passed an actual five\npercent rate increase for them last year\nit had been tied up at cms awaiting\napproval we did find out a day before\nyesterday that original five percent has\nbeen approved and so we're adding one\nadditional percent\nthere as well\n15 to 11\njust telling the department to use some\nof the arp money that they have for a\nrate study\nat 15 2.12 a 5 increase for non-waiver\nfamily support\nat 15 213 i mentioned the behavioral\nhealth nurses and aids and so this is\nthe first entry that you see where we're\ndoing a substantial\nincrease in pay for those individuals\nand you'll see that several other times\nwithin this section of the budget but i\nwant to point it out to you there and\nyou'll see it in three or four other\nlocations\nmoving on down to 15-14\nwith the\ncoming extension of the national public\nhealth emergency it allows us to capture\nsome funds that we would normally have\nstate funds that we normally have in\nprograms because that's being extended\nfor another 90 days and so what we're\ndoing in dbhd is saying to use those\ndollars and plow those back in to direct\nservices to individuals through that\nlanguage item\n1535 is the addition of 15 forensic peer\nmonitors\nexcuse me mentors\nto help provide for transition and\nre-entry to support services 15-4-1\nis just a true up\nthen moving on to 15-4-10\nwe agree and completely and totally\nsupport the assisted outpatient\ntreatment programs but realize that\nthose cannot be stood up on the first\nday\nso what we've done here is just account\nfor knowing that they're going to have\nto do a staggered implementation on\nthose going forward\nthe housing voucher program at 15 412\nyou'll see an increase to about 500\ntotal housing vouchers and then a\nprogram manager at the line just below\nthat\nand then you'll see it 15 4 14 15\n16 17 18 19\n20\nare all increases related to either the\nhealth behavioral health plan or the law\nenforcement package here in the house\n15 421 deals with the georgia crisis and\naccess line that goes live on july the\n16th making sure that it's fully stood\nup and operational\n22 are the nurses 23 is a new 18 bed\nmedical psychiatric unit it with our\npartner grady memorial hospital\nthen the behavioral health rate study\nthat i mentioned a while ago is at 15\n424\nand then recognition of the extension of\nthe public health emergency at 15 425\nmoving on to child adolescent\ndevelopmental disabilities\nat 1564 you'll see in addition to a very\nspecial partner that we have in the\nstate called extra special people or esp\nto expand their services to more\ncommunities in our state\nthe additional help for our nurses and\nhealth aides and then\n1566 is another partner that we have in\nthe savannah area the matthew reardon\ncenter for autism that provides services\noutside of the metro

very next day there may be\n25 more show up or they're only going to\nget counted or paid for the five that\nwere there on that day so what we're\ntrying to do is give them more\npredictability and

program in\nthe budget\nand we're doing that for transparency so\neverybody always knows where it's at so\nwe can all see it and you'll see it\n24.20.3\nof course the 5.4 increase for those\nnurses as

at\n25.4.2\nrecognize the 118 million dollars that\nhas spread across the entire budget at\n25.3.2 you'll see where we raised the ps\ners retirement system from a 1575 per\nyear service up to 16 per year service\nso that's that's your bus drivers and\nthose folks that don't fall under any of\nthe other retirement plans that is their\nretirement plan\nunder the state forestry commission you\nhave several things here that are all\nsort of tied together\nthere was an audit done of how they\nfunctioned\na couple of years ago and they\nidentified several opportunities for\nefficiencies and areas of savings\nso what we're doing is putting a person\nin there to manage\nuh kind of the p's and q's on a lot of\nthese areas but also you'll see it\n26.1.7\n2.6\nand at 3.7\npart of a employee development and\nretention plan that they've been working\non now for several years 26.3.6\njust the replacement of where they were\nusing some federal funds when we got\ninto the tight in fy 21 and

the\naddition of two investigative positions\nthere\nto expand or to investigate any of those\nthings dealing or related to children\nunder human services\nunder after-school care just

middle georgia in the\nmacon area are very familiar with\nthe pace center and what they're doing\nwith many of these young females and\nwe're looking to make sure that that's\nsomething that we can replicate across\nthe state\nunder child support services you'll see\nthe the first entry there 28 4.6 and 4.7\nas it relates to the sags on\nchild support services and also the\nparalegals under that program as well\ntaking them to the 77.50 rate for the\nattorneys and 40 an hour for the\nparalegals\nmoving on under child welfare services\nan ad there to our casas our court\nappointed special advocates\nvery active in our communities they're\nthey're kind of the backbone in many\nways as it comes to child welfare\nservices\nas they engage into the court system and\nso what this will do

incredible\nincredible partner with us\nin this program\nwe've established sites across the state\nwe'll be establishing more sites across\nthe state and the addition of three\nmillion dollars there helps us stand up\none more\nsite and also helps us expand the\ntelemedicine capabilities within that\nprogram\nat 28.97 you'll see uh\nmore funds for the non-medicaid home and\ncommunity-based services in addition\nthere\nand then at 28-12-4\nanother one of those things that has\nbeen a priority of this house is dealing\nwith our foster children and what you'll\nsee there is an addition to the clothing\nallowance for these children of 275\ndollars in addition to what they already\nget for these families they're hosting\nthese children in their homes and trying\nto make sure that they're clothed and\nadequately clothed to go to school and\nparticipate in activities across the\nstate\nunder family connection at 28 18 1\nour friends at family connection again\nanother one of those entities that's in\nevery one of our our communities across\nthe state are restoring the cut from\n21 but also making a slight addition\nthere for a program that they're going\nto be rolling out as it relates to\nmental health as well\nremaining on in community services\nmoving on down to the vocational\nrehabilitation agency at 28 23.7\nthere was some cash put in for some\nmaintenance and repairs that that they\nneed on some of their facilities however\nwe have found that they have about 9.5\nmillion dollars in outstanding are\nexisting bond balances that they can\nspend for those improvements you'll see\nsome additions then for independent\nliving services for the commission on\ndeaf and hard of hearing and then at 28\n23 10 an addition to allow them to open\nback up those priority service\ncategories that they had to close down\nas we came up short on cash a couple of\nyears ago\nduring the dip with covet and then a\nrestoration of funds for the georgia\nradio reading service at 28 23 11.\nmoving on to the office insurance\ncommissioner\nyou'll see it 29.4.7\njust the recognition of the fees that\nthey collect within that office those\nfees are used for investigative services\nin many different ways whether it be\nelevators or hazardous materials\ncompliance with manufacturer housing\ncarnival rides they have to do all of\nthose inspections so what we're doing is\nallowing them to keep the vast majority\nabout 3.8 million dollars in those fees\nand then pulling back about 383 000\ndollars in state funds that that are\nabove what they're needing for those\npositions\nand then at 29.4.8 part of the\nbehavioral health package is the\nimper the inspector that they will need\nto have in place as it relates to mental\nhealth parity with the insurance\ncompanies\nunder gbi\nat 30.1 30.1.6\nthroughout gbi we'll be adding\nan additional 67 positions in the crime\nlabs medical examiner's office\nuh investigative divisions and all of\nthat\nand so they're needing some additional\nhelp as it relates to human resources\nwith the increased workload that those\nindividuals will bring with them at\n30.1.7 you'll see an ad there of 1.1\nmillion for capital maintenance and\nrepairs at their headquarters\nthen moving over to 30.3.6\nyou'll see six additional positions\non top of what the governor had already\nrecommended for those medical examiner\noffices\nto address their workload and then the\ndeath investigator specialist you'll see\nin addition there that we've added\n30.3.8\nand trying to put some parity in there\nas it relates to 25 of their employees\nand then increasing about 207 crime lab\nscientists\n30.3.9\nagain part of the law enforcement\npackage as it relates to trying to get\nthrough the backlog\nof chemistry and firearm cases\nthen moving down to 30.4.7\njust annualizing four positions we had\nadded in the amended budget for uh\nelections investigations and then\ndealing with the gang task force

responder\ngrants to help local communities\nbe able to equip their law enforcement\npersonnel\nthen under the cjcc the accountability\ncourts you'll see some additions there\nmost of those editions all deal or all\nof those editions all deal with a law\nenforcement package but your first one\nat\n30.6.6 also deals with the mental health\npackage as it addresses the expansion of\nthe mental health accountability courts\nand court managers but you'll also see\nthat those other items tie directly to\nthings related to either things that law\nenforcement run into our mental health\nprofessionals run into\nunder juvenile justice section 31\nyou'll see throughout it also an\nadditional two thousand dollars on top\nof the five thousand dollar cola for\nthose jcos\nagain in testimony from the commissioner\nwe found that they have a 90\npercent turnover rate within those cos\nhe came to see me the other day he was\nhappy he was talking about the great\nimprovement they had made on their their\nretention\nand i said well\nyou're at 90 percent\nhe said yeah but we were at 97\nand i said i got you i understand\ncompletely\nat\n31.3.9 and also at\n31.411\nyou'll see a reduction in funds there\nthose two items were funded in the\namended budget with cash but you'll also\nsee the two thousand dollar adjustment\nfor those individuals as well\nmoving into the department of labor\nthe labor budget is a little smaller\nthan what it had been and and it's\nbecause of really one move that's being\nmade\nas it relates to the workforce\ninvestment act\nand moving that under the department of\ntechnical and well under tcsg\ntechnical college system of georgia\nso that we can better align those\ndelivery of services to the end users\nbut also better align those services to\nthe needs of employers\nthese individuals its envision will be\nco-located in the department of labor\noffices across the state as employees of\nthe tcsg system\nbut when those individuals come in and\nfind they're lacking\none certificate or a little bit of\ntraining here there to be able to apply\nfor either this job at fourteen dollars\nan hour or this job at twenty

it the\nother day but gbi or excuse me state\npatrol covers 105 counties in the state\nwith swat\ni just assumed that every county or\nevery city had some type of cooperative\nagreement internally within the county\nto cover swat but there are 105 counties\nthat this georgia state patrol and their\nswat unit provides that coverage for\nthose\n39.4.9 again the recognition of\nincreasing fuel

the state\nsection 41 university system\nif you'll move over first at 41.4.4\nunder the enterprise innovation\ninstitute or ei squared\nyou'll see additional fundings for some\nmatch money\nunder the atdc\nto help with\nstartups and leverage private funding\nthere\nit's about a one-to-one match or a four\nto one match it's a considerable match\nthat's added there\nremoving some one-time funds at 41.8.4\nfor a program that that dealing with\ncyber training rural coding that did not\nget stood up\nwe'll keep evaluating that going forward\nunder gtri the georgia tech research\ninstitute at 41.10.6\nhelping them as they look to stand up\nstem programs around the state primarily\nin rural counties that science\ntechnology and engineering engineering\nand mathematics programs we all know\nthat many of the small school systems do\nnot have the resources they need to\nexpand on that and so gtri has been kind\nenough to offer that up as something\nthat they would be glad to help with\nmoving on to\n41132 under the medical college\naugusta university\nour our state's medical school there\nwe'd added funds last year for a\none-time foundation grant\nbut they're continuing to expand their\nthree plus program which gets medical\nstudents in and out\nof their residency in three years\nand so what we've done there is said no\nto the cut\nadded an additional 4.8 million to bring\nthat total to 10 million dollars in\nrecognition of the growth of that\nprogram under public libraries at 4114 7\nyou'll see an increase in the\nper capita grant from 40 cents to 50\ncents per capita or an increase of 10\ncents\nthere\nmoving on to 41 41-15-4\nyou'll see that is a move from the\nteaching program at 41-18-15\nsaying yes we support the program it\nactually belongs here in this program\nunder special funding initiatives\ninstead of under the teaching program\nalso under special funding initiatives\nyou'll find a program that chairman\nknight has been working on now for about\ntwo years maybe three years actually i\nguess as it relates to aviation career\npathways\nmiddle georgia state university has done\nan incredible job in the program that\nthey have between macon and eastman and\ngrowing that program\nand so what we're doing here and in the\nbond package is recognition of that and\nthat expansion of those programs to get\nmore of those individuals through the\nprogram and into the pipeline earning\nvery good salaries going forward\nat 41 18 1 you'll see a slight\nadjustment there it's just a true up 41\n18 3 again just to true up\nnow when we get to 41 18 8\nyou'll see that we have said yes in\nlanguage but no on funding\nthis program and a couple of other\nprograms i'll point out here in just a\nminute are actually a unit programs and\nin the university system there's an a\nunit budget and a b unit budget the\nspecial funding initiatives\nthe land grant mission at the university\nof georgia and at fort valley state fall\nunder the b unit\nbut under the a unit are the typical\ninstruct instruction programs and so\nthose actually reside in the a unit that\nthe board of regents actually approves\nand says yes we will stand up this\nprogram\nwe've never funded those these type\nprograms in the teaching formula here\nand so what we're seeing is yes we're\nfine with you going on and doing that\nbut we'll fund it when the time comes in\nthe correct place\nin in the future\nmoving on at 41 1810 again a merit-based\nscholarship program again\nnot the place that this belongs uh we're\nnot saying you know we don't agree with\nit we're just saying that it is not to\nbe created in this particular spot 41 18\n3 and 18 14 again a couple of items that\nrelate back to that a unit issue that i\nmentioned a minute ago 41 1815 is the\none that got moved back into sfi and at\n4118 7\nuniversity of georgia small business\ndevelopment center sbdc\nthey're needing they're continuing to\nwork with more and more\nnationalities of folks that are coming\nthrough the program so they were needing\nsome help with some additional\nmultilingual professionals to help them\nservice those individuals that

the\ngovernor's office of health strategy and\ncoordination\nearlier\nmoving on to student finance\nsection 44.\nyou'll see at\n44.1.8 in the commission administration\nyou'll see the addition of some\npersonnel to help administer some of the\nnew programs that we've added so\nthroughout the law enforcement package\nand the behavioral health package you'll\nsee\nseveral things that we have added and\nwe've not only added them in this budget\nbut we've added them over the last\nseveral budgets especially under the\nservice council alone program\nso it takes people to administer these\nprograms and we've been remiss and not\nfunding those\nin the past\nat 44 2.1 you'll see it true up there as\nit relates to dual enrollment under the\nengineering scholarship at\n44.3.1 another true up\nunder hope ged at 44 6.1 a change in the\nmethodology on the payment as it relates\nto the ged test\nwe've been\nfunding that upon a 500 grant per\nparticipant at the completion of the\nprogram what we're doing here is\nactually going to pay for the test on\nthe front end that's the big expense\nthey have to come up with\nso that's allowed for us to capture a\nlittle bit of a savings there under hope\nscholarships private schools you'll see\nan increase of six percent there\nand then under public schools you'll see\na true up at 44 9.1\nthere under service council loans\ni'd mentioned that a little bit ago\nand you'll see a\nad there at 4415 1 as it relates to the\nlaw enforcement package gbi\nrelated to the full-time examiner\nmedical examiner positions trying to\nincrease that package to be able to\nattract those individuals\nthe national guard scholarship at true\nup in the formula 15-2\nand then part of the law enforcement\npackage on service council loans for\nlocal and state law enforcement officers\nto be able to pursue\ndegrees in criminal justice or other\nrelevant social science fields for 1.4\nmillion at 44 15 4 you'll see just the\nrecognition of the 10 million that we've\nput in in the amended budget\nfor the\nbehavioral health professions\nstudent council loan program there under\ntegs or tuition equalization grants at\n44161\nyou'll see a bump there from eight\nhundred fifty dollars to nine hundred\ndollars for those students\nunder teachers retirement there's no\nchanges under the technical college\nsystem\nuh you'll see a few changes there\nif you look at forty six 46.4.1\nyou'll see a reduction we made there for\na program that's not up and running just\nyet\nwe'll continue to\nmonitor that and do what we need to do\nshould it get up and running\n46.6.10 the dual achievement program\npilot\nan adjustment or true up on what the\nactuals have been in that program at\n46.611\na recognition of the high cost\ninstructional programs that tcsg does\nfrom truck driving\nuh to welding several other high cost\nprograms\nthat the tuition is just not enough to\ncover what we're doing is saying we're\ngoing to come in and help cover that at\n46 612\nagain part of what chairman knight has\nbeen working on for several years as it\nrelates to aviation programs\nthese will be those folks that that work\non airplanes and make sure that\nairplanes are are running and operating\nthe way they're supposed to\nand so just kind of bolstering those\nprograms at several institutions across\nthe state\nnow when i get to transportation i told\nyou yesterday in the full committee\ni've got a cheat sheet that\nchairman perkle has provided for the\nmine spaghetti that the transportation\nfunding formula is\ni'm going to read it off because i can't\nexplain it any better than what it reads\nright here on this piece of paper\nso i'll start with program additions to\nthe g dot budget include an investment\nof 10 million dollars to airport aid at\n47.1.2\nwe've restored 1 million\nand at\n47.1.5 we've increased funding by 9\nmillion so it's 10 million dollars total\nwe've also added 10 million dollars to\nstate on rail lines at 47.12.12.\nin the balance of the transportation\nbudget we ensure dedicated fees were\nused for the purpose for which they were\nintended transportation trust funds\nincluding the hotel motel tax ev and\nheavy vehicle\nare used to fund the atl greta certa\ndebt service and transit\nto accommodate the source and use of\nfunds directive we also utilized fund\nswaps throughout the transportation\nbudget\ntrust fund dollars were replaced with\nstate general funds at 47.1.3\n47.10.6 and 12.8 and put into debt\nservice\nsimilarly trust fund dollars were\nreplaced with motor fuels at 47.3.2\nthe bulk of this swap is found in the\nincrease of 14 million in capital\nconstruction at 47.2.1\nand the balance in the recruitment\nretention adjustments at 47.4.25\n9.2 11.2 13.214.2\ntrust fund dollars were replaced with\nstate general funds at the adjustment\nat the adjustment to recruitment and\nretention in portsmouth waterway at\n47.10.8 and in rail at\n47.12.11 while adjustment to retention\nand transit at\n47.15.10 utilizes both trust funds\nwhile we're looking at the transit\nprogram we did another fun swap but for\na different reason\nhouse bill 511 provided a cap of 10\npercent of the transportation fund trust\nfunds were being used for transit the\nnumber was 1.2 million dollars over the\ncap and so that adjustment is reflected\nat\n47.15.7 and 15.8\nyou'll see additional true ups at\n47.6.3 and 6.4 to accurately reflect the\nbase budget for the newly established\nprograms as shown in rail at forty seven\ntwelve five and transit at fifteen five\nforty seven dot six dot one and thirteen\ndot ones are true ups to reflect\npositions left out of the five thousand\ndollar cola\nso there you have that\num\nagain i refer you back to the sheet that\nuh our analyst abby day created the\nlittle bubble graph that's on your desk\nfor the probably the best explanation\ni've ever seen of how transportation\ndollars are used in the state of georgia\nmoving on to department of veterans\nservices section 48\nyou'll see it 48.2.4 just the\nrecognition that there remains one\nmillion dollars in the base\nfor the new

already helped you chairman\nperkle for a question\nthank you mr chairman will the gentleman\nyield yes sir\nis it not true that this budget provides\nflexibility\nuh to meet the federal matching\nrequirements related to the\ninfrastructure bill\nand also provides clarity in being\ncompliant with the state-owned\nshort-line railroads absolutely it does\nand\nyou know somebody smarter than us and\nbefore us decided that it was a wise\ninvestment to invest in those\nstate-owned short-line railroads and we\nhave an obligation as a state to\ncontinue to make sure that they're\nmaintained into a level that's safe\nefficient and affordable to those\nneeding to use them cross them or have\nanything to do with them yes sir well\nthe gentleman for the yield yes sir\nis it not further true that it has been\nan honor and a privilege to observe the\ndedication\nthe compassion and hard work of the\nchairman\nuh and to see lived out the motto of\nthis

one\nmore maybe yes sir okay so lady in the\nback from the house district 139\nrepresentative bentley has a question to\nyour left to the strawberry queen yes\nma'am yes sir thank you mr leader with\nthe gentleman yield yes ma'am\nthank you chairman uh england for your\nwork on this budget i know you put a lot\nof\nhours in and i certainly appreciate that\nuh but for a point of clarity i need a\nbetter understanding of\nthe raises\nfor state employees is something about a\na dollar amount that would be given on\napril 1st i'm not really certain about\nthat but can you help me to understand\nwhat's going to happen on april 1st as\nit relates to state employees and this\nin this 5 000 raise i just need to be\nreally clear on that sure absolutely\nwithin the amended budget if you recall\nthe 5 000 raise is handled kind of two\nways\nand and it's it's all kind of about\nlogistics and how that happens so\nand what the state employees will see on\napril 1st\nor thereabouts very close to that will\nbe a one-time payment of thirty seven\nhundred and fifty dollars\nand then from april 1st on appearing in\ntheir paycheck divided evenly from there\nuntil june 30th will be an additional\n1250\nwhich overall amounts to a 5 000 race in\nthis current fiscal year so when you get\nto july 1 and doing it that way coming\nto july 1\nthen there will be no change in their\npaycheck the 5 000 then will be built in\nthrough this budget through the\npaychecks all of next year so it it\nwe're doing it in a way that that\ndoesn't spike their paychecks for the\nlast quarter but puts them where they're\ngoing to be going forward so they don't\nget to june 30th and all of a sudden see\ntheir paycheck drop because there was\nfive thousand dollars trying to be\npushed out in one quarter it'll be done\nin a in a one-time payment and then the\nother 1250 dollars will then be\nallocated to them over that remaining\nthree months\nthank you uh mr chairman i'm going to\ncall time on this last question\nif you'll take it one more from\nrepresentative david not chairman david\nknight from the 130 house district you\nsee the airplane man yes\nthere's\ndoes a gentleman yield yes

things\nuh in regards to removing the the\nspecial initiative fees\nwe've done some great things as far as\nresetting the hope scholarship so that\nbetter aligns with\ntuition fluctuations and getting\neverybody up to that ninety percent\nlevel\nand isn't it true that this is going to\nsave\nliterally tens of thousands of students\nanywhere from\nuh you know hundreds of dollars up to\nyou know two and three thousand dollars\na year in higher education it will and\nyou know i i mentioned it a little bit\nand\ni'm glad you asked that question because\ni don't know that folks understand

recommends that\nthis bill do pass\nby committee substitute\nchair recognizes representative\nwilliamson\nto present the bill\nthank you mr speaker members of the\nhouse it's a rather anomaly for me today\nto stand before you with a bill in front\nof me in front of you for your\nconsideration that doesn't deal with\nfinances uh is the principal subject\nmatter but what is what this bill does\nis it addresses an anomaly we have in\nour licensing system for adult\nresidential\npsychiatric treatment centers\ncurrently under state law unlike the\nfederal government which has a sort of a\ncategory or licensure for these kind of\ncenters our adult residential\npsychiatric treatment centers\nare\nforced to go under the licensure of\npersonal care homes personal care homes\nare problematic for this kind of service\nbecause problem personal care homes\ntypically address end-of-life issues or\nlater in life mobility issues cognitive\nissues things of that nature\nunder your in a personal care home you\ncan have visitors whomever you want to\nsee anytime you want to see them you can\nhave packages delivered that might not\nbe in a residential psychiatric\ntreatment care facility might not be\nis um\nhelp\ncould be harmful to to people seeking\nto get well for mental illnesses and and\nsuch as that\nso it also uh importantly in a personal\ncare home\nhealth care providers cannot administer\nmedication so for example someone having\na psychotic event they can't come into\nthe residences and administer the much\nneeded medication they have to transport\nthem to an emergency room at a much\nhigher cost so this bill in essence\nfinds the correct licensure\nfor this uh\nmedical\nit provides a seamless continuum of care\nthroughout the res the psychiatric\ncommunity\nand\nand it does it in a cheaper manner than\nthe\nworkaround method we're using now\nmr speaker i'll be happy to answer any\nquestions if not i yield the weld and\nask for the

remark\nnow i i know where the no button is but\ni do have a question\nwhen i'm going through this\nit seems to me that this licensing board\nwould actually make for more competition\nand make it better for the consumer to\nfind the care that they need am i\nreading this correctly that's absolutely\n100 correct it'll foster more\nopportunities for georgians to find the\nmental health care that they need at a\nlocal level that's a great question\nthank you from that mr speaker i'll be\nhappy to yield the well and ask for the\nbodies of favorable consideration\ngentlemen has yielded the

you mr speaker\num thank you uh colleagues for allowing\nme to present to you house bill 1388 uh\nwhat this bill does is uh um gives some\nflexibility in\num assigning the legal organ when\nyour newspaper shuts down 10 times so\nfar in the state of georgia illegal\norgan has just completely shut down it\nhappened in my district twice and in\nthat case\nthe code as written now\nit's fairly strict in\nthe guidelines of how to become a legal\norgan\nyou have to have a paid\nsubscription you can't have 75 percent\nmore or more in advertising in the\nnewspaper well in in our case\nthat would mean that the only legal\norgan would be a legal org in a county\nover that doesn't have any subscription\nin our county\nwhich is not the underlying intent of a\nlegal organ to give notice and when it\nhappened in\nour situation we were without a legal\norgan for entirety of a month which\nmeans that many of you with local\nlegislation\ncouldn't couldn't do that if it happened\nto you\nin in your district what this allows for\nis that\nin the event that you\nyour legal organ shuts down you can\nqualify as an intermediate legal organ\nif you do not meet the 75 percent uh\nadvertising requirement or if you do not\nmeet the paid\nsubscription\nuh element of the current code and\nthat's the\nadjust of the bill i'd ask you for a\nfavorable vote and hope you can do that\ni appreciate

well\n[Music]\nthe gentleman has wisely yielded the\nwell\nwe have other members who wish to be\nheard on the bill the chair recognizes\nrepresentative bode to speak to the bill\nthank you mr speaker i appreciate the\nopportunity to speak\nto\nhb\none\nthree three one first and foremost i\nwould say that\nthe speaker was absolutely correct uh\nthe georgia department of labor has had\nmany challenges that we have all had to\ndeal with and help our constituents to\ndeal with\nespecially during these two years of the\npandemic however\ni would be voting yes for this\nlegislation\nonly before for one reason i'm going to\nbe voting no\nis that this legislation does not have a\nsunset\nbeing that it does not have a sunset\nthis bill\nwill affect\ngeneral assemblies and also the\ndepartment of labor\nthe commissioner\nand two perpetuity\nnow i just want to give an example\nof the reason why we need\na sunset\nwe have elections coming up\nall of us in this room are going to have\nto run for the re-election we're going\nto have every statewide constitutional\nofficer up for re-election\nincluding the governor including the\nlabor commissioner and so with that\nbeing said why does the labor\ncommissioner\nof future\ngenerations of future years have to\nsuffer because this current labor\ncommissioner did not perform his\nconstitutional duties\nand i recall\nlast year\nsb\n152\nbipartisan piece of legislation\nthat pretty much every member in this\nchamber voted for\nthat was the labor chief officer bill\nbasically our oversight bill\nan oversight bill to have the general\nassembly\nand also the governor's office\nto have this current labor commissioner\nto report every monday on how many\nclaims\nare being filed\nhow many claims are being paid out how\nmany appeals have been filed how many\nappeals have been heard\nevery monday this general assembly and\nthis speaker of the house would have\ngotten a report\nbut\nthe governor vetoed that legislation\nand the reason why the governor stated\nit was an overstep of this general\nassembly\nto basically\nhave\nthe\nconstitutional officer which is the\ndepartment of labor commissioner report\nto the general assembly\nit's a violation of separation of powers\nexecutive branch\nlegislative branch\nso i'm trying to find out what changed\nwithin a year\ni'm trying to find out why\non page 3 of sb156\nline\n48\nsection h\nthis code section\nshall stand repealed on december 31st\n2022\nunless continued in effect\nby the general assembly prior to that\ndate\nwhy does this legislation not have a\nsunset\ni would vote for this bill if the sunset\nwas december the 31st\n2022\nthis bill\nwill take away some serious powers from\na constitutional officer\none of those powers is to operate the\ncareer centers across this state\nthe one-stop shops\nthat power will be a codified and taken\naway\nfrom the department of labor\ncommissioner\nalso the department of labor\ncommissioner will have to basically\ntransfer any funds that goes into\nthe\nunemployment security administration\nfund\non line 50 have the money deposited to\nthe department of labor commissioner and\nwhenever the governor's destiny who is a\npolitical appointee and not an elected\nofficial\ntransfer the money into\nthat\ndestiny's\naccount\nso\nwe have a federal act\nthat states traditionally across the\nstate\nacross this country\ntraditionally the department of labor\ncommission is the one to distribute\nthese federal funds\nthe governor's designee is not\nelected by the citizens of this state\nthe gun governor designee has to answer\nonly to one person the governor and not\nthe citizens of the state of georgia\nso i'm going to ask you to vote no\nbecause this is not bad policy at all we\nneed to have some coverage over this\ndepartment of labor and this labor\ncommissioner because we all had to pick\nup the phone and figure out how can we\nhelp our constituents when no one from\nthe department of labor would pick up\nthe phone and ask the call of the\nconstituents of this state\nand we're still answering those calls\ntoday republican and democrat but i'm\njust asking that we're fair to the next\nlabor commissioner and allow that person\nto do their job and prove themselves\nworthy based upon the citizens of the\nstate that vote them into office i would\nvote yes if you had a sunset of december\n31st 2022 but i'll be voting no because\nyou don't mr speaker i would yield the\nwell with no questions\nis there any\nis there any objection\nto the previous question

was so let me recap\nfor you\nthe description of the bill\nhouse resolution 594 would allow\ntemporary property tax relief for\ndisaster damaged properties which are\nlocated within a nationally declared\ndisaster area\nthis bill came about because speaking to\nlocal city officials county officials\nthey were lamenting the fact that a\nproperty owner who lost a house at the\nend of march paid property tax on\nsomething they didn't have to the end of\nthe year\ni was told it could not be changed it\ncould not be done with the help of the\nways and means committee we did present\nto you an

time in the well for a\nspeech so\nhere we\ngo i'd like to start by saying that i\nam a concealed carry permit holder\ni want to repeat that\ni\nam a concealed carry permit holder\nis there seems to be a misconception\nthat you cannot advocate for gun safety\nand be a gun owner at the same time\ni can see lots of my colleagues who i\nknow\nhave concealed carry permits\nbut they can also get they can also\nadvocate for gun safety\ni'll be honest i am a city girl\ni was born and raised in the suburbs of\nnew orleans\nbefore we had to worry about carjackings\nthere was no there was no\nreason for us to have a gun\nnone my dad his city boy same thing\nhis parents did not have guns he didn't\nhave guns he didn't need one he was in a\nplace with safety\nmy mother's family on the other hand\nlives in rural louisiana\nthe mississippi river is in their\nbackyard\nthe gulf of mexico is about three blocks\naway in the front\ntons of critters\nmy grandfather shot shot everything that\nwas moving in his yard\nexcept for his grandchildren\nthankfully\nwe never had we never had guns in my\nhouse and i chose not to have a gun when\nmy kids were little because of the\nstatistic\nthat if we had a gun in the house we\nwere more likely to shoot each other\nthan we were to someone breaking into my\nhouse\nbut\nin 2020 i was watching\na presidential debate\nand during that debate\nit was told to people with some of the\nworst behavior\nto stand back\nand stand by\nstand back\nbut stand by\ni immediately grabbed my computer\nand bought a gun online\ni live one country block away\nfrom academy sports i bought the gun\nonline i got an email that said your\ngun's ready for pickup\nwalked down the street picked up the gun\nno problems\nbut the salesperson said\nwhat happened last night\ni said i don't know what happened last\nnight he said i don't know either but we\nran out of guns last night\nwe sold out of guns last night\nso i wasn't the only one who thought\nthat is a bad omen to stand back and\nstand by\nbut i also in the same day signed up me\nmy husband and my two kids\nfor gun safety classes\nnot\ngun\ntarget track pr practice not\ngoing to the the shooting range in\npractice we had sit down classes with my\nentire\nfamily\nnow you fast forward to today\nand i'm an empty nester\nnow usually when i say that i do a\ncartwheel but since i'm wearing a dress\ni'm not going to\nmy kids are both in school in the uk\nthe biggest reason why they're in school\nin the uk is because it's cheaper and\nyou can ask me about that later but\nanother reason why they're in the uk\nis\ni do not have to worry about my kids\ngetting shot in the uk\nthe u.s\nhas\ngun\ndeaths a hundred times\nmore than they have in the uk\neven the police do not have guns\ni am the mother of a black 18 year old\nchild\nhe's still a child to me\ni don't have to worry about him getting\nshot in the uk people ask me don't you\nmiss your kids they're so far away\nno because they're safer there they are\nsafer in the uk than they are in\nsnowville\nthat's a big deal for me\ni'm not losing sleep\nabout my kids in the uk because even the\ncops don't have guns\nnow\nwhen i was a new candidate i went to all\nthe new candidate trainings\none of those trainings it was you know\nseveral days and i connected with this\nlady there\nand you know we were going had meals\ntogether we were in groups together and\nat the end of that training we had to\ngive our stump speech\nnow\nmy stump speech was\nmediocre at best\nbut her stump speech she started with\ni am the mother\nof jordan davis\nand it had to be a couple of weeks\nbefore that\nthat i watched the movie or the\ndocumentary three and a half minute ten\nthree and a half minutes ten ten bullets\nand that is the documentary of jordan\ndavis's\nmurder as a mom\nthat documentary was gut-wrenching\ngut-wrenching and it was fresh in my\nmind so when she got up and she said i'm\nthe mother\nof jordan davis\nthat was her only child who was murdered\nthat day\ni lost it i just\ni was so overwhelmed by emotion that day\nthat she wound up comforting me\nit was her child that died but she\ncomforted me because i was so emotional\nthat day when she said that\nand\nas a mother\nthat is the worst possible thing\nthat can happen to me something happens\nto my kids that's why they're in the uk\nand that's why i feel good about them\nbeing in the uk and i would be afraid if\nmy 18 year old black son were here\nso i don't really care about the it's\nnot the gun it's the person or this is\nour unfettered constitutional right\ni thought voting was an unfettered\nconstitutional right but we got all\nkinds of hoops we got to jump through\nnow\nthe fact is our kids are dying\nthey're dying\nand i know that this is a bipartisan\ngoal\nto make georgia safe enough\nfor my kids to come here\nand me not lose sleep\nthinking my 21 year old black girl and\nmy 20 18 year old black boy is out\nin the line of fire\nand i know that that's a bipartisan goal\nand for that i ask you to vote no to\nthis measure to keep our kids and our\nneighbors and our families safe\nthank you mr speaker and i yield a well\nchair recognizes representative roberts\nto speak to the bill\nthank you mr speaker\ncolleagues i'm also going to start with\nuh i'm pro-second amendment\nwhen i was about 10 years old a man was\nselling cleaning products door-to-door\nand he tried to force his way into our\nhome\nluckily a neighbor had called just\nbefore to warn us but i remember my mom\ngoing and buying a gun almost\nimmediately afterwards going to the\nsheriff's office to train\nand get her permit i believe we should\nbe able to protect our families\nthat said\nlike the majority of americans and\ngeorgians i believe in common sense\nregulations such as background checks\npermit-less carry would allow people to\ncarry guns\nopenly or concealed without a weapons\ncarry license or criminal history check\nthereby dismantling georgia's system of\nresponsible gun ownership\nit would also deprive\nlaw enforcement\nof this vital\ncheck which\nseems completely inconsistent to me\nbecause all of us in this chamber\nsupport law enforcement\nnow i know the response is going to be\nbut criminals don't apply\nfor\ncarry permits\nwell i have some statistics from kevin\nholder the executive director of council\nof probate judges now all counties\nreport the total number of applications\nprocessed but the law doesn't require\nthem to report denials so these numbers\nare probably under reported in 2018\n2654 applications were denied and 11\ncounties didn't report including three\nof our largest\nin 2019 2854\npermits were denied 11 counties still\nnot reporting\nin 2020\n5292 denials with four counties not\nreporting including gwinnett which has\nover a million people\nguess what the number one reason is for\na denial\ncriminal history mental health history\nis also another one that a judge can\ndeny a permit on\nso let that settle in more than 5 000\napplicants likely with criminal or\nmental health histories were denied a\ncarry license\nthe other thing just like representative\nhutchinson talked about\ni have a daughter graduating from high\nschool and\none of the reasons that i am supporting\nher uh going to trinity college in\ndublin ireland is because it has always\nterrified me\nthat you can carry guns on college\ncampuses and now we are removing\nin light of increased mental health\nwe're all seeing the mental health\nnumbers skyrocket\nand we all know on college campuses we\nhave excessive drinking so again we're\nrelaxing\nthe minimal restrictions\nwe have\nand and so\ni feel safer with her going to college\nin ireland\ni know y'all are tired i know you've\nheard these i know it's not going to\nchange your vote but i got to tell you i\nhave constituents\nwho are terrified for their children for\ntheir families\ni will never forget in\nearly february 2018\nwhen brigid my daughter came home from\nmiddle school\ndescribing for the first time an active\nshooter drill\nshe talked about how scary it was\nto have to crawl on a shelf in a closet\nand sit in the dark for what felt like\nforever\nmade me start thinking about what kind\nof drills i did as a child\ni'm from dalton georgia\nwe did tornado drills in the south right\nmy dad's job moved us to california so\nmiddle school and high school we did\nearthquake drills\nbut it makes my stomach turn that our\nchildren\nare sitting in dark spaces\nfearing for their lives that a shooter\nis going to take them out i i just i\ncan't even handle it in\ntwo week that was early february 2018\ntwo weeks later i found myself\nsobbing on the sofa again as the\nparkland instant\nyou know was on the screen of my tv\nand i got angry\nbecause i realized it had been six years\nsince we watched babies\nbeing killed at sandy hook and not a\ndamn thing had changed\ni signed up to run for office two weeks\nlater\nand guess what y'all\nnothing has still changed instead you're\nwanting to relax what little check we\nhave and why what for\nbecause it's inconvenient for law\nabiding citizens to fill out a form\noh my goodness\ni just told you statistics\nthat more than 5 000 people were denied\npermits likely because of criminal\nhistory and mental health\nso i got to ask you\ni mean we don't know how many people we\nkept safe by denying those permits\nbut i gotta ask you if you thought\nfilling out that little piece of paper\nmight stop\na\nnon-law-abiding citizen or somebody with\na mental health history\nfrom hurting one child in the state\nwouldn't he just\nprioritize filling out the paper instead\nof the inconvenience\ni'm sorry when did we become this\nsociety that it's\nall about we're so self-centered it's my\nfreedom my rights my my my\nthis filling out a paper\nis just inconvenient\nit's a common sense check that keeps our\nlaw enforcement safe and could keep our\nfamilies safe\nso if you have\nany i plead with you please say no to\nthis bill\nchair recognizes representative wilson\nto speak to the bill\nthank you mr speaker\ncolleagues before we take this vote i\nhave some tough questions to ask\nwhy is it that we will not listen to law\nenforcement on this issue\nwhy is it that the people in this room\nthink that they know better than our law\nenforcement officers our sworn deputies\non how to keep our communities safe\nwith this bill we're not being\nproactive in preventing gun violence\nwe're being reactive\nfor political gain\nthat's all this is\nover the last couple years\nduring the pandemic we had an uptick in\nviolent crimes\nin communities that i live in\nand it was covered all over the news and\nwe had multiple hearings under the gold\ndome\nto address this\nwere those hearings just for show\nwe had law enforcement officers chiefs\nof police that were asked what can we do\nwhat can we as lawmakers do\nto make our streets safer to make your\njobs\nsafer\ndo something about all the guns\nthat's what they said\ndo anything\nrequire a lock box in the car\ndon't make us\ndon't force us to resell the firearms\nthat we confiscate\nhelp us do anything to limit the number\nof guns\nbut this is an election year\nin fact my memory\nis long enough to remember the governor\npromising when he ran in 2018\nbut this bill could not be more\nmisguided\nbecause let's be clear\nthis is an extreme\npolicy position\nwe're saying you need a license to drive\na car\nbut not to have a gun\nhow does that make any sense\ni won't belabor the point here because\ni think this year especially we've all\nwitnessed the pressures that the\nmajority party is under\npressure to cater\nto far right activists that are so\ndisconnected from reality\nthey cannot be reasoned with\nalmost every session\nyou give them a nibble of what they want\nbut this is a whole lot more than just a\nnibble\nso even if you won't vote against this\nmeasure\ni just want you to think seriously about\nthe consequences\nof us being unable to know that firearms\nin this state are in safe hands\nit is going to mean more crime\nmore shootings\nmore guns equal more shootings\nit's it's not complicated it's very\nsimple in fact\nif that is the manufactured crisis that\nyou want to happen so that you can\ncontinue to take political advantage of\nit\nthen i guess it may make sense\nbut i certainly don't agree with it and\nwe know for a fact the majority of\ngeorgians the vast majority of georgians\ndo not agree with it\nso for the sake of our communities i ask\nthat you vote no\nthank you mr speaker\nokay we have others that wish to speak\nand so the chair recognizes\nchairman setzler\nto speak to the bill\nthank you mr speaker ladies and\ngentlemen the house i rise today in\nsupport of hb\n1358 which when you break it down\nis a common sense bill\nit's a common sense bill and i'm sad to\nsee that members of the minority party\nare trying to make accusations this is\nbeing done for political gain\nthey make they make reference to\nelection year these kinds of things\nbut if we boil down the circumstance\nabout someone having the\nability to exercise their basic right to\nself-defense\nthe basic right to defend themselves\nwe find that weapons carry licenses when\nit really comes down to it only do one\nthing\nweapons carry licenses only prevent\nlaw-abiding citizens\nfrom being able to defend themselves\nwhen they really really need to\nlawbreakers\ndon't need a weapons carry permit\nthey're going to break the law they're\ngoing to perpetrate violence and crime\nlike sandy hook and charleston south\ncarolina some of the things that were\nalluded to earlier those violent crimes\nwere not perpetrated\nby law-abiding citizens they were they\nwere perpetrated by killers\nintent on killing others and breaking\nthe law\nthe reference was made to the mentally\nunstable mentally unstable people who\nwere intent on using firearms to create\nterror do so\nby breaking the law\nthe only impact that weapons carry\npermits have\nis if someone is in need to defend\nthemselves\nto prevent them from doing it because\nlaw-abiding citizens who follow the law\nwho would otherwise\nneed a permit\nto carry a firearm to defend themselves\nwould be inhibited from doing it as a\nlaw-abiding citizen\nso as i talked to folks and as folks\nhere in georgia are listening to this\nthis debate let's boil it down\nto what this is really about\nmy mom's a very very small lady she's uh\n4 foot 11\nand has always been\na person a very slight build not super\nathletic and i can imagine\nif we were in downtown atlanta and my\nmom is a young mom there's moms out\nthere all across georgia and all across\nthe metro area that would look much like\na very petite lady imagine her pushing\na baby stroller down the street in metro\natlanta\nimagine to their horror hypothetically\nwe can imagine this though that someone\nwere to jump out and and try to snatch\nyour child\ni mean if someone were to snatch the\nchild of that person\na big athletic man and jump in a truck\nor a van and drive away does she have\nthe ability to defend herself and her\nchild with her own hands\nof course not\nshe is physically being dominated by\nsomebody who's athletically\njust overwhelming to her\ni know a good friend who actually served\nwith us in this general assembly that\nhad trained a\nconstituent of his\nwho never thought that she would need a\nfirearm but three months after she had\ndecided to carry one was actually\ndowntown in linux mall and she was\nloading christmas presents into the back\nof her car and a man came up behind her\nand said ma'am i'm going to take your\npurse from you and was going to take her\npurse\nhaving availed herself of the\nopportunity to carry a firearm she was\nturned and pulled up on him the man kind\nof freaked out didn't expect this petite\nyoung lady to be carrying a firearm and\nwithdrew immediately and she was saved\nand she saved herself\nwithout firing a shot\nbut by having that equalizer\nfriends people who don't have the\nability to carry that equalizer with\nthem expose themselves to dangers that\nwe can only think about\nin horror\nand the reason hb 1358 is so important\nfriends is because many people when\nthreats present themselves don't have\ntime to go down to the probate court\njudge's office get their fingerprints\nget things sent back to them go through\nthe process and have that\nhave a permit sent to them in a period\nof weeks in fact in many counties in my\ncounty in particular there was during\ncovid there was a process you had to\nregister online you had to schedule an\nappointment it was a really really long\nand drawn out process\nbut whether it's a long and drawn out\nprocess in your county or whether it's\nsomething that happens in one or two or\nthree weeks if a threat is made on your\nlife\nthat's an anti that's not anticipated if\nfor the first time in your life\nyou\nwhether you're a big strong athletic\nmale or a small slight petite woman like\nmy mom and family members if a threat is\nmade on your life that you know you\ncan't defend yourselves you're terrified\notherwise rendered\nfearful to stay in your house\nyou don't have time\nto go get a concealed carry permit you\ndon't have time to get a weapons carry\npermit and wait the weeks it takes to\nget that in friends if you're a person\nlike many of our george many georgians\nwhen you need to defend yourselves\nagainst potential aggressors you don't\nhave weeks to wait\nwhen seconds count\nladies and gentlemen the house 1358 is a\ncommon sense bill because in spite of\nall the the images created by the\nminority party and challenging this\ncommon sense tells us\nlaw breakers\ndon't need a permit the only thing that\nthat is only people that are inhibited\nby this weapon carry license is\nlaw-abiding citizens\nwho follow the law and would otherwise\nneed to defend themselves\nnothing in this law requires georgians\nto carry firearm if you as a georgian\ndon't want to carry a firearm don't\ncarry one\nbut if you as a georgian feel the need\nto or if you feel you don't feel the\nneed to today but the time comes in\nwhich you do your family\nis threatened or you feel a threat that\nemerges very quickly\nthis bill provides you the ability to\nprotect yourself\nprovide the equalizer that's essential\nto preserve you and your family\nand i think it's it's a good common\nsense law that we can all support\nand be proud of and without mr speaker i\nyield the will\nchair recognizes chairman heath clark\nto speak to the bill\nthank you mr speaker um\nthis is something i don't do a lot you\nknow i've been here for eight years and\nit's very rare for me to get in the well\nto speak to somebody else's bill but i'm\nhere today to speak in support\nof this bill\nand i know\ni know there's people\nthat are good people honest people\ncaring people that we're just going to\ndisagree on this legislation\nbut i just want to explain\nwhy i'm supporting this bill and why i\nwould try to urge some of the people who\nmight be on the fence\nto support this\nfirst of all this bill does not change\nwho can carry or where you can carry\nit simply says if you meet all of the\nqualifications that the state has laid\nout\nto to be able to carry a firearm in this\nstate\nthat you can carry that firearm without\nhaving to ask permission\nand pay what is essentially a tax\nthat is\nthat's the bill the state has laid out\nall the requirements\nto qualify to carry a firearm\nand if you meet those qualifications you\ncan carry\nin fact most people what we know in\nother states 16 other states have passed\nthis legislation as of yesterday\nand most people in those states\nstill apply for a license\nwhy is that reciprocity in other states\nand expedited gun purchases when you\nshow up at a licensed firearm dealer\nwith a georgia weapons carry license\nthey know that you have a valid\nbackground check\nand so you're able to receive that\nfirearm\nin a more expedient way if you do not\nhave a georgia weapons carry license and\nyou go\nto purchase a firearm they have to run a\nbackground check on you\nthat is that's the federal law\nyou know there's a lot of talk out there\nabout gun show loopholes and all of that\nthere is no such thing that is a\nmisconception\nthat there is no such thing as a gun\nshow loophole\nthe people at a gun show are federally\nlicensed firearm dealers and in order\nfor them to sell a firearm they have to\nhave a background you have to have a\nbackground check\nso\nmost people would still elect to receive\nthe georgia weapons carry license so\nthat they can expedite their gun\npurchases and have reciprocity in other\nstates\nso\nyou know it was mentioned earlier about\nwe're being proactive and and not\nreactive and that's not totally true\neither\none thing that we've seen through covid\ni believe one lady was speaking about um\npurchasing a firearm and they showed up\nat academy and they were talking about\nall the guns being sold out and that was\nsomething that happened during coven\nand we saw that\nbut what wasn't talked about a whole lot\nwas the the significant\ndelays\nin people being able to receive their\ngeorgia weapons carry license when the\ncourts were shut down during covid\nthat has not been publicized that has\nnot been talked about and that\nis an infringement upon the second\namendment\nyou could go purchase a firearm\nbut you cannot possess and carry that\nfirearm outside of your house or car\nbecause the courts of this state did not\nprocess and there's still a huge backlog\nwe're talking longer than six months\nin some cases to receive that georgia\nweapons carry license so that is an\ninfringement upon the right of that\nperson to be able to carry and exercise\ntheir second amendment right\nwhat good is owning a gun if you can't a\nfirearm\nif you can't carry it to protect\nyourself and the purpose that people\nhave purchased those firearms to begin\nwith\ni know one one speaker mentioned voting\nand how we have to jump through\nloopholes to vote i would disagree with\nthat but let's compare the two\n[Music]\ncurrently hold on currently\nto go vote you show up\nand you present your license and\nvalidate who you are\nand then you're given\na card and you go into the booth and you\nvote\nyou cast your ballot you go\nput it and then you take the paper you\nput it at the machine it can't it cast\nyour ballot for you\ncompare that to\nwhat we do with with with guns\nyou go\nto a store you present your your license\nto validate who you are and they do a\nbackground check and see if that's who\nyou are and they validate that\nbut in order to carry that firearm\nyou have to go\nand then\nfill out more paperwork\nget a license\na concealed carry license\nand then you can carry and pay a 75 fee\nif we're going to really compare the two\nthat would essentially be we need to\nstart charging a poll tax again\nand make people pay\nto to practice the right the fundamental\nright of voting and i would disagree\nwith that just like i disagree\nwith forcing people to pay\na tax\nto carry their firearm and so like i\nsaid mr speaker 16 states have already\nput this into practice\na lot of the concerns we've heard have\nnot been\nplayed out in those states\nand i would just urge people if you're\non the fence right now still on the\nfence about this\nagain this bill doesn't change who can\ncarry or where you can carry\nit just simply says if you meet the\nqualifications that we have laid out for\nyou to exercise your second amendment\nright that you can do so\nand that's that's the bill mr speaker\nand i would just urge people to vote in\nfavor of this legislation thank you and\ni yield the will\nis there any objection to the previous\nquestion being ordered\nthe chair hears none the previous\nquestion is ordered\nwe have a minority report and then we\nhave the chairman's time\n20 minutes for the minority report and\n20 minutes for the chairs time\nthe chair recognizes what purpose does\nthe minority caucus whip rise thank you\nmr speaker i move that we table house\nbill 1358\ngentlemen has moved that uh house bill\n1358 be tabled all those in\nfavor of the motion will vote i\nthose opposed to tabling will vote no\nand the clerk will unlock the machine\n[Music]\nof all members voted\nhave all members voted\nif so\nthe clerk\nwill lock the machines on the\ngentleman's motion\nthe eyes are 52 the nays are 91 the\nmotion fails we go on now to the\nminority report and the chair recognizes\nrepresentative holly\nfor the minority report\ngentlemen\nsuspend\nall right this house will come to\norder house will come to order\nwe have a minority report and chairman's\ntime\nthey're entitled to your respect\ngentlemen may proceed\nthank you mr speaker\nsomething as i sat here\nand i remember\nactually i have to even say this because\ni've never spoken to a bill from the\nwell before\ni'm just thankful to god for allowing\nfor me to be here in this place\ni used to work\nwithin walking distance down that way\nfour judges\nincluded\njudge kimberly warden who i know was\nlooking down from heaven right now\nand i'm just happy i'm here and\nhopefully i can make you proud\ni come to you today i rise to\n[Music]\nask you to join me in voting no for this\nbill\num much to like my colleague from\nthe 35th\ncame here and i'm able to speak about\nhow it was so important for us to look\nat law-abiding citizens\nbut then at the same breath said that\nthose same law-abiding citizens would\nfind it too cumbersome to go before a\nconstitutional officer in a probate\ncourt and get an approval through a\npermit\nwe look at line 68 of the bill\nand it tries its best to define\nlawful weapons carrier\nbut no matter how you define it\nthere are only just carriers\njust as there are only citizens and not\nlaw abiding citizens\nwhich are citizens\njails all across georgia are filled with\nfolks who thought\nthey were law abiding citizens until\nthey were not\nwe all tell ourselves that we're going\nto obey each law\nuntil someone we love\ngets harmed\nmaybe a daughter of yours maybe a niece\nsomething happens to them and then all\nof a sudden\nyou just might snap\nyou might do something that's outside of\nwhat the law will allow\nthen all bets are off\nyou know when i when i was writing those\ndomestic violence warrants the little\npink warrants\ni always bear in mind the fact that just\nwith that pin\nthe ability to enforce that law\nis necessary just to defend the lives of\nthose not only who are at the hands of\nthose who are violent\nbut also those who are going to be\nresponding to that violence\nthe ones who are going to protect us\nthe georgia commission on family\nviolence reports that a whopping 84\nof the family related\ndeaths\nthis year\ncome at the hands of someone who was\nholding a gun\ndoes that sit with us right now\n84\nliterally we're looking at the fact that\nwhen it comes to law abiding\nit's what we all hope for\nbut\neach of us has the right to either\nchoose yes we're going to do right or\nchoose against it\nhowever those americans who are dealing\nwith severe stress\nvery deep pains for which they have\nsought help or maybe have not sought\nhelp\nmaking the right choice is not so\nclearly black and white as it may be for\nthe lawmakers in this room\nask any prosecutor will tell you the\ncriminal offenses in the georgia code\ndescribe acts which a person's\nculpability\nto commit that crime must be determined\nin order for those charges to stick\na person's mindset\nalong with the review of the\ncircumstances leading up to their\nactions can determine the extent of the\ndanger imposed\non themselves or others\nnow yes much has been discussed this\nlegislative session in the way of mental\nhealth from counseling to special living\nfacilities to peer groups that help\nfolks\nwho are\nunfortunately trauma bonding in their\ntime of anguish\nand these are really great benefits i\ndon't make any effort here to diminish\nthem because they do have value\nbut when folks with severe\nmental issues\nand deeply painful experiences\nyou can just go drive down to their\nlocal gun shop heck they can get in go\nonline right now and be able to purchase\na gun\nwithout so much as telling a georgia\nlicensed physician or counselor for\nscreening or to ask permission to help\nkeep other americans safe\nthen won't it be our legislature who has\nfailed them\nwe're putting our own communities at\nrisk\nnow please i i don't want you to get\ntwisted\ni have a very very healthy appreciation\nfor our second amendment rights i mean\nwe could talk days upon days between\nbrowning and gatling and\ni even like how it serves and i know\nthat's not even a gun\nbut\nthe problem still is\nis that\nwe still have a very\nvery precarious situation that we're\nleaving our law enforcement officers in\nthe men and women that i used to have to\ntake in their warrants from local folks\nto even the gbi\nand we're not even just talking about\nthe measures to keep folks safe with the\npermit\nlet's talk about training\nthe fact that those same courthouses are\nworked at walk a little further up\nyou'll find georgia post\nthat's right\npeace officers there's this training\nstandards the standards of training\nit's necessary to be able to not only\nhave that permit but also to be able to\nknow how to use that firearm\nand yet there is nothing in this bill\nthat is stating that it's going to be\nnecessary for people to even be able to\nknow how to use that firearm\nand that's really the tough part about\nthis\nlook we know\nit's an election year\nand so many here have been pressured i\nmean we're all here\nwe\nput up a big black fence around this\nplace you think you're secure\nbut you know good and well\nthat there's law enforcement officers\nfrom our georgia capitol police\nto those who are in our local\ncommunities\ni wanted to highlight for you even today\nup here unfortunately we're not showing\nhim\nbut even four officers\nthat we found even in 2021\nwho were unfortunately gunned down\ntrying to serve the\npublic our colleagues from the 171st\ndistrict\nthe 31st the 149th and the 75th\ncertainly have heard about captain\njustin bedwell\ncertainly know the sacrifices of sheriff\nlena marshall\nthey know corporal dylan harrison and\ncertainly for those in clayton county\nknow officer henry lackson\ni know\nfor those residents who live with me in\nhenry county we certainly know the\nsacrifice of officer paraman's messiah\nthese are people who kiss their families\ntheir wives goodbye\nhug their children get out here\nand hopefully we can keep them safe by\njust asking for a small\ndocument\na paper to be approved of by a\nconstitutional officer a judge\na judge who was sworn to the duty of\nprotecting the public\nwe respected those constitutional\nofficers here enough to give them a pay\nraise\nbut are we\nstill so bold\nnot to listen to the cries\nof those family members\nwho have lost an officer that they lent\nto us\nwhen soon as they let after their house\nand here today\nthere's a bill\nthat the georgia sheriff's association\ndoes not want us to pass\nhere is a bill\nthat the georgia association for the\nchiefs of police\nus\nnot to go through with\nand yet here today\nare we really going to allow\nfor an election\nto cause us to turn our backs on the men\nand the women\nwho have come to us to try to protect\nour communities\ni really don't think this is the time\nfor us to take up these matters\nthis is something that\nif we're not going to table it\nhere's what i would suggest you do\nbecause the public is not aware fully of\nwhat goes on here\nif you believe\nthat this measure is causing you to do\nas my colleague\nfrom the from the uh\nwarner robins area suggested that it's\nthat you're on the fence\nthis is probably a time\nwhere a local law enforcement officer\nwho knows you that you talk to\nsomeone that you have long trusted for\ntheir opinion\nthis might be the time that they call\nyou on your phone and you will need to\ntake that call to understand what their\nconcerns are for this measure\nand how it will put their lives in\njeopardy\nso that's all here\ni think we all are very clear about\nwhat's going to happen in this place\nbut i must say\n[Music]\ni really wish god would be with the\nofficers who come to their next traffic\nstop\nbecause they have you to thank for the\nnext actions from here\nthat's all\nchair recognizes representative mclaren\nfor the balance of the minority report\nthank you mr speaker\nsometimes i think\nsome folks in here probably think with\nthe amount of you know flailing around i\ndo that i don't love this building i\nlove this building\ni love this building for the people in\nit a lot of times i'll stop by the\nminority leader's desk and i'll me i say\nman this building\nand the minority leader will save this\nbuilding\nand then i'll walk away and that's the\nwhole conversation but i promise you i\ntreasure my relationships\nwith you\nin this place and i look up listening to\nmy colleague and i look at the ornate\ndecorations and i think about legacy and\nlisten i'm getting nostalgia because i'm\nleaving and so what you know it's that\nquote from gladiator when a man sees his\nend he wants to know that there was some\npurpose to his time and special rules\nyou know what i mean i mean that's the\nkind of sentiment that i'm bringing to\nyou right now\num so let's talk about legacy because i\nfeel qualified after a couple years to\nspeak even just a little bit\nabout legacy and this bill is steeped\nin legacy it comes from a very specific\nplace a very specific identity of a\nformer state representative\nand that former state representative\nis matt gertler\nthis is matt gertler's bill\nthis is his old hb2 constitutional carry\nsome version of it and do you remember\nwhat a pariah he was when he was in this\nbody he came up to this well for a\nmorning order i mean literally any air\nyou gave this guy he'd come up and be\nlike have y'all heard about\nconstitutional carry\nif you haven't we'll dedicate another\nminute of the time for colton moore to\ncome up and tell you the same thing\nhb2 y'all what do you think the number\none email you all got in the 2019-2020\nterm was\nright answer\nhb2 constitutional carry brought to you\nby matt gertler one of my favorite\nmembers of the house just because of his\nenergy man i called him a liberty robot\nbecause that's what he was\nhe was like you know vote no i mean he\n50 of the time he voted no unlike every\nbill including the good ones\nand why did he do it because he had this\ncalculus that liberty was simple\nliberty's not complicated liberty is\neasy to protect vote no boom go home get\nreelected right\ni had a game this is not a joke well it\nis a joke but it's not this is what i'm\nsaying is true i had a game show i\nplayed with myself imagine like you know\ngame show network like why did girler\nvote no and so i would like see his no\nvote it'd be like one or two no votes\nand i think to myself okay i'm gonna go\nup to him and i'm gonna guess the reason\nhe voted no\nand sometimes it was really fun i mean\nhe had that one with the um the cable\nbill\ncable service for military folks right\nyou go overseas you're like serving your\ncountry\nand and the good people in the\nrepublican party and georgia state\nlegislature said we're gonna let those\npeople out of their cable contracts\nearly like that's the least thing we can\ndo for active duty military and kirtland\nwas like nah man no you're stuck in that\ncable contract right and so i went up to\nhim later and i was like hey gert i got\nthis little game i play where i try to\nguess why you voted no tell me why you\nvoted no\ni said is it because freedom of contract\nright we don't want the government to\ninterfere with freedom of contract he\ngoes easy and he walked off\nso he was the liberty robot\nhe\nis who this is about\nthat type of thinking that there's no\nnuance to liberty\nthat freedom is an absolute\nand this house\nnot only blocked him but took pride in\nblocking him no sir\nrepresentative matt gertler you are not\ngoing to you're not even going to get\nthe slightest bit of air we'll give you\nmorning order time but you will never\npass a bill you're always on the wrong\nside of this chamber and everything you\nstand for is not what we in the majority\nstand for i mean he you could not have\nbeen more of a pariah than matt gertler\nthe the just the rousing celebration\nwhen his replacement came and i love his\nreplacement\nbut but this house was like overjoyed\nwhen it got rid of gerd\nbut here we are passing his bill\nso what changed\nwhat changed you know the very first\nwords out of the author's mouth where we\nbent you know\nfreedom and liberty or words we banned\nyear round don't care about freedom in\n2019\ndo you care about liberty in 2020\nor just figured out this year\nthat matt gerler was right the whole\ntime\n[Applause]\nyou know when i first joined the house a\nmember house leadership said to me with\ngreat gravity that i appreciated that i\nstill appreciate when i look at the\nceiling and i think about the honor of\nbeing here that some people just want to\nburn this building down and they don't\ncare\ni think about my no votes on a local\ncalendar it actually kind of sucks\nbecause i get emails from your\nconstituents saying you voted no on our\nlocal bill why do you care because i'm\nmaking a protest obviously\nbecause you didn't care about what our\nlocal governments wanted to do so why\nshould we care about yours man\nbut i care about this institution and\nthat member of house leadership said to\nme some people just want to burn the\nbuilding down and girl is one of those\npeople i guess that sentiment holds when\nthere's only a handful of people that\nyou say it about when the rest of us are\nsteady-handed and civilized but i guess\nif the whole majority in the whole house\nwants to finally burn it down together\nthen it's not burning it down anymore\napparently\nevery democrat who spoke from the well\ntonight flipped one of your seats\non the message that the public doesn't\nwant stuff like this\ngo through the list\nwe hold formerly republican districts\nwhere people with\ncertain demographics whatever\nbelieve that they need representatives\nwho are not going to buy into this drift\nright bs\nto appeal to the base\nit's not an accident that we came up\nhere to deliver this message\nthe majority party has made the\ncalculation that the short-term boost\nthey get for the base\noutweighs long-term damage to the brand\nand public policy consequences that is\nwhat you own tonight\nand let me tell you something\nmatt gertler's no longer here\ny'all took him out\none of somebody posted an ocean's 11 gif\nof like we did our work we got rid of\nthe guys that were on the other side and\nnow we can sail off into the sunset\nwe're so happy\ncelebration all around\nbut even though matt gertler's not here\neven though he's in dc working for\nthomas massey helping him put you know\nassault rifles and christmas cards or\nwhatever\nhis idea is on the house floor on a\nfriday night\nand even though matt gertler's not here\ntonight\nformer state representative matt gertler\ntonight\nwins\nmr speaker i yield well\n[Applause]\nwe're going on now to the chairman's\ntime\nchair recognizes\nchairman jay collins\nthe chair\nof the public safety and homeland\nsecurity committee\nthank you mr speaker\ni won't take much of the chairman's time\nhere this evening\nbut i do find it very ironic that some\nof the people in this chamber now who\nwanted to\ndefund the police a few years ago were\nasking us to trust the police i find\nthat to be a very rich irony\nhere late in the evening\nyou know when i came into this house i\nhad a lot of people back home in my\ndistrict\nwho were pushing me on constitutional\ncarry\nand if you'll think back about it you\nknow i haven't been one of those people\nwho stood down here in the well or\nadvocated in the hall for for\nconstitutional carry\nbut for me\npersonally my mind on constitutional\ncarry was changed just a few years ago\nbecause see when i go home at night\ni drive about 35 miles west\ninto a little community called\nvillarrecra georgia\nand when i turned on the tv\nand i saw our capital city let's talk\nabout burning\nlet's talk about our capital city\nburning down with rioting and protesting\nlet's talk about that\nlet's talk about our capital city\nburning\nand public safety officials\ncouldn't get post-certified officers\ncouldn't get police officers to come do\ntheir job because they didn't have their\nback\nlet's talk about burning down\nthe capital city\n30 miles from my home\nand then let's talk about all the people\nthat reached out to legislators and said\nyou know\ni've never had to have a reason to carry\na gun but now that i want to\nmy magistrate my probate court is shut\ndown\ni can't carry a gun\nand they're burning down these\nneighborhoods right around us\nwe're seeing violent crime\nso yeah my mind was changed about\nconstitutional carry\nyou know one of the things i've heard\nthis evening is we've heard a lot of\nrhetoric and we've heard a lot of drama\ndramatization about\nwhat this is going to do and what that's\ngoing to do and i like looking up at\nthis capital ceiling as well\nbut i read a book with my little girl\nit's called chicken little\nthe sky is not falling here ladies and\ngentlemen\nthe sky is not falling\nno state that has adopted constitutional\ncarry has had to repeal constitutional\ncarry because they seem blood in the\nstreets\nno state that's adopted constitutional\ncarry has come back and said you know\nwe made a terrible mistake\nlet's put the car in reverse\nno state has done that as a matter of\nfact i believe some of the people that\nare going to come up here and speak to\nthe balance of the chairman's time\nmay allude to some of that\nbut ladies and gentlemen i'm with you\nabout burning down the building\nthat changed my idea about what\nconstitutional care meant to me and my\nfamily 30 miles west when we saw\nthe absence of public safety during\nrioting and looting\nand mr chairman or mr speaker i'm going\nto yield the balance of the chairman's\ntime\nto two speakers\nchair recognizes\nchairman ballinger\nfor a portion of the chairman's time\nthank you mr speaker curiously nobody\ncame and asked me any questions\nbut there were some falsehoods that were\ntold up here and i feel the incumbent\nto clarify to clarify them\nour sheriffs the georgia association of\nthe sheriff's association here in\ngeorgia i texted their executive\ndirector they are neutral on this\nposition on this bill\nthe chiefs of police they are also\nneutral on this bill\nas for it being gertler's bill\nthat's not gertler's name up there\nthat's mine i signed this bill this bill\nis mine\ntheir permit less carry has been filed\nseven or eight times in the last six\nseven years by various members of this\nbody but that's my name up there and\nthis bill is mine\nthis does not do away background checks\nyou have to have a background check to\neven buy a gun\nonly people that beat the current permit\nrequires requirements will be able to\nexercise permit less carry\ny'all there's evil in the world\nour courts have ruled that our hands\nhands\nare deadly weapons\nshould we chop everybody's hands off\ngive us all little hooks\ncars knives fertilizers ied\nall of those things people use to hurt\nothers\nthere's evil\nwe need to protect ourselves\nwe do listen to our law enforcement\nofficers but we do need to\nnot neglect our personal responsibility\ndriving is a privilege not a right so\nsays our courts\nit is not in the constitution you have\nthe right to ride your horse anywhere\nyou have the right to ride the carriage\nor car anywhere that's not in the\nconstitution\nour leaders in congress have not had a\nconstitutional amendment\nto add driving a car therefore you\nshould have a license and prove that you\ncan exercise that privilege\nsafely on our streets\nyou know i'll close with this some\npeople say why do you carry a gun\nand i say because the law enforcement\nofficer is too heavy i yield the well\nchair recognizes for the remainder\nof the chairman's time\nchairman alan powell\nthank you mr speaker and ladies and\ngentlemen and uh before i say anything i\nwant to thank\nmy dear friend representative ballinger\nfor carrying this bill today\ni'm going to talk about a number of\nthings and first i want to get a couple\nof things off my chest and i heard some\nof the opposition speak\nand there was a lot of miscellaneous\ninformation i think it was portrayed no\nthe sheriffs\nand the chiefs\nobviously haven't said anything\nin opposition as a matter of fact i had\na group of these sheriffs from northeast\ngeorgia here today\nand none of them said anything to me\nbecause i already knew their positions\nthey believe in the second amendment\nor as a lot of the law enforcement\npeople will tell you that the best\nfriend the law enforcement officer has\nin an emergency is a law-abiding citizen\nwith a weapon that knows how to use it\nto back them up\nand that's something we've always said\nbut i heard some of the other comments i\nheard a former member being\nbeing referenced and how he was run out\nof here well i don't think he was run\nout i think he resigned any or he didn't\nresign but he ran for congress if i\nremember correctly\nso a lot of the sensationalism that's\nbeen said is you know quite frankly\nmisinformation and i understand it's an\nemotional issue to some people\nsome people are just adamantly opposed\nto it but i want to talk a little bit\nabout the history when i was elected\nto the general assembly\nit was a different day\nthan it is today\nwhen i was elected 32 years ago\nyou you either didn't need a permit\ndidn't have a permit or you had what was\nrecognized\nas a pistol toter's license\nyou went to the probate judge whatever\ncounty you lived in you gave them five\ndollars\nif the probate judge recognized that you\nwere a\ngood citizen or\nyou might have been convicted of\nbootlegging or something that was\nconsidered an honorable profession in\nthe day\nbut as long as you hadn't shot anybody\nother than your wife's lover then you\nwere\ngiven a license at that time\nbut i remember when i was elected the\nfirst\ni remember that the first bill that i\never passed in this body\nwas a second amendment bill because at\nthat time\nyou could carry a weapon in your vehicle\nbut you had to keep it locked in the\nglove compartment or in the trunk well\nguess what kind of good that would have\ndone and i finally it was like pulling\nteeth\nbut we got it moved to the compartment\nor\nsomewhere under the seat so you could\nget to it if you ever needed it because\na gun that you can't get to an unloaded\ngun\nreally doesn't serve the purpose\nfor what it is and i'll\npause right here to tell you\nthat your weapons and your rights to\nhave a weapon\nmeans that that is a weapon for your\nprotection or for your sporting ability\nit's a defensive weapon it's not an\noffensive weapon\nif it's an offensive weapon then you are\nviolating the law\nbut it's a defensive weapon for your\nprotection\nbut i remember a few years later we went\non and we had a good member in here from\nhis name was curtis jenkins and he and i\nwhen the brady act was passed in\nwashington\nwe had an opportunity then that we\nstepped up the\nweapons permitting license\nand we passed that law and curtis he\nlater went on to other issues and other\nfame and\nhopefully fortune by getting out of the\nlegislature\nbut we passed that bill on the heels of\nthe brady act\nand that was to require\na background check\nbecause that background check then put\nus in compliance with the federal law\nand even circumvented the intent of the\nbrady act\nso that if you wanted to get a weapon\nyou didn't have to wait\nseveral days or weeks or whatever\nbecause you'd already been background\nchecked\nwell from that point on there was a\nlittle bit of a little bit of\nlegislation passed here and there\nnothing outstanding\nand then i don't know a few years ago\nrepresentative jaspers and\nrepresentative ballinger came along\nand we had a guy by the name of for\nthose of you who don't remember\njohn mattis\nor the huckleberry is a lot of folks\naffectionately knew him as\nand we came forth with house bill 60.\nand that was a bill that we really got\ninto\nthe weeds about concealed weapon permits\nand\nwe passed that bill\nand somewhere over in my office if you\never come by over my office you'll see a\npicture on the back of my wall over\nthere\nit's a picture that the new york times\nand the la times\nput on the front page of their paper\nand had a picture of me and i think it\nwas representative jasper's backside was\nshowing\nand it had in there on the front page of\nthese two\nesteemed papers that there will be blood\nin the streets in georgia because of\nthese dangerous individuals\nwell folks that was about eight years\nago\nand the only blood in the streets that i\nknow of today\ncomes\nfrom criminals people perpetrating\ncriminal activities\nwe're living in a different society\nyou know\ni'm going to read the constitution in a\nminute but i'm going to give you another\nlittle tidbit of this\nbut you know\npeople have always had weapons\nthey've always had weapons because this\ncountry was founded\nin the blood of\nrebellion it was founded in the blood of\nrebellion\nand that's always been something that\nour\npeople have always relished\ni don't think that there's times in this\ncountry that people actually wanted to\ncarry a weapon but they carried a weapon\nand usually the bad guys were always\ndispatched in some shape form or fashion\nbut i hear all of this talk this\nanti-talk\nbut i want to\ni just want to read a couple of things\nto you and i'll give you another little\ntidbit of history maybe to answer what\nsome of the earlier comments have been\nmade\nif you read your constitution on the\nsecond amendment\nprovides for a well-regulated militia\nbearing being necessary to the security\nof a free state\nthe right of the people to keep and bear\narms shall not be infringed\nyou know if you believe in the law of\nthe land\nif you believe in all of those things\nthat so many of you\non the opposition party or those who may\nbe a little bit left of the folks that\nlike to i always love to hear that\nsaying i'm second amendments but\nbut what\nyou need to read\nyour rights shall not be infringed on\nnow i want to read you the georgia\nconstitution\nand this is an old this is an old\nlanguage that's been in there and it\ndeals with the arms right to keep and\nbear the right of the people to keep and\nbear arms shall not be infringed\nbut the general assembly shall have the\npower to prescribe the manner in which\narms may be born\nsame language a little bit of a version\ndifference on the general assembly's\nduty\nso\nfor the last 100 or so 150 years\nas general assemblies meet they decide\nin which manner they'll be born but they\nstill keep in mind\nthat the rights of the people shall not\nbe infringed on ladies and gentlemen\nthey should\ni can talk about crime i chaired public\nsafety i've been involved for\n30 years 32 years in public safety in\nthis state and in the legislative arena\nand i'm quite frankly taken back\nwith the level of crime that i see today\ni see what law enforcement officers\nwhat they have to deal with\ni know why people need\nto be armed but they're not mandated to\nbe armed\nif they want to be armed and exercise\ntheir rights they can do it\nbut i will tell you whether it is a\nconcealed weapon permit that is current\nor permit less carry\nit's all the same\nbecause if you look at the statistics\nit's not those people who have a\npermitted license\nthat are creating harm they're creating\ncriminal activity\nand it won't change\nyou're still going to see the same\ncriminals\nthe ones who get their weapons a\ndifferent way by breaking into your\nhouses or breaking into your cars\ni will submit to you ladies and\ngentlemen again\nyou won't see brook blood roll in the\nstreets with this\nyou'll see the same\naction you always will\ni have even told people my personal\nadvice to them is because of the con\ncurrent concealed weapon law\nthat you need to keep that if you have\none\nbecause it's worth it for two fronts one\nis it if you go to another state\nthen you'll have reciprocity if that\nstate doesn't recognize\nour laws\nso you'll still have that right\nmore importantly you will have already\nmet the prescription of the federal laws\non going to a licensed gun dealer\nto buy a weapon\nthis is what the second amendments will\ndo\ni would encourage everybody here to\nremember this\nbecause this is your family it's your\nright to protect yourself ladies and\ngentlemen\nmy thanks to the lady\nmy thanks to the so many of the members\nin this house that have\nthat have supported this but i do want\nto leave one parting thought to you\non something\ni kept hearing the sailing point in here\nwas about the right or the left or the\nextremism and such as that\nlet me tell you something there are\nthose of us who have been here that\nwe've been second amendments all along\nand i want to tell you and i want to\ntell some of the folks out there that\ncontinue to put out misinformation about\nsecond amendments in the georgia general\nassembly or at least weighs this house\nyou know we've got several groups in\nthis state that are strong second\namendments\nwe've always been strong second\namendments but quite frankly there's a\nlittle thing about political power and\ninfluence runs downhill\nwe live in a state\nunfortunately i've seen the\nthe\npower and the influence of the\nlegislature wane over the whole 30 years\ni've been here\nit's always been usurped by the power of\nthe executive office\nit's because we're a part-time\nlegislator and the governor is there but\nwe never had a governor\nthat promoted\npermit less carry or that term\nconstitutional care\nso for the naysayers out there in radio\nland\nthey can hear what i'm saying\nthere's a lot of members of this house\nit's always been\nsecond amendment strong\nbut if you don't have a governor that\nsays it he'll support the bill we're not\ngoing to pass a bill that he's going to\nveto that'd be crazy\nso we now have a governor who has said\nthat he will support permit less carry\nthat's the difference ladies and\ngentlemen and let's move on to the next\nstep\nand i would encourage you\nto cast your green vote on this board\ndon't say i'm second amendment but\nbecause we know what that means\nstand up and support your constitution\nladies and gentlemen mr speaker thank\nyou for the time and i will yield this\nwell\nthere any objection to withdrawing the\ncommittee substitute\nthe chair here's nun the committee\nsubstitute\nis withdrawn\nis there any objection to adopting\nthe substitute offered by the committee\non rules\nthe chair here's none the rules\ncommittee substitute is adopted\nis there any objection to agreeing to\nthe report of the committee\nwhich was favorable to the passage of\nthe bill the chair here has known the\nreport of the committee has agreed to\nshall this bill now pass\nall those in favor of the passage of the\nbill will vote i\nthose opposed will vote no and the clerk\nwill\nunlock the machines\nwhat purpose does representative mccloud\nrise\nparliamentary inquiry inquiry\nis it true that if we were really\nconfident that guns done don't kill\npeople then we would demand that the\nmetal detectors be removed from the\ncapitol\nwell i think that addresses itself to\nthe judgment of each and every member\nwhat purpose\nrepresent does\nchairman petrie rise\nparliamentary inquiry\nmr speaker is not true that according to\nthe cdc almost every major study on\ndefense of gun use has found that\namericans use their firearms defensively\nabout 1.7 million times annually\nthe gentleman so states i'm sure he\nsincerely believes that to be true\nwhat purpose does representative derrick\njackson rise parliamentary inquiry\ninquiry\nmr speaker is it not true the reason why\nwe have a fence around this building is\nbecause what took place on january 6\nwhen insurrectionists\nwhen ins\nmay i finish\nmay i finish\nallow the gentleman to finish his\nparliamentary inquiry thank you mr\nspeaker\nis it not true the reason why we have a\nfence around this building it's because\nwhat took place on january 6 is not\nbecause of the criminal activity that\ntook place in atlanta\ni think the offense was planned in\nadvance of both of those events uh\nrepresentative\none more parliamentary inquiry and then\nwe're going to\nlock the machines what purpose\ndoes chairman tarvin rise\nbaltimore into inquiry state your\ninquiry mr speaker is it not true that\nthis fence was planned in 2018 or 19 due\nto fine white powder uh\non the statues out here and all around\nthe capitol and it was for to keep\npeople out of here at night not to\nprotect us in the daytime\ni believe that to be true i know it was\nplanned a number of years ago\nall right if all members voted\nhave all members voted\nif so the clerk will lock the machine on\nthe passage of house bill 1358\nthe eyes are 94. the nays are 57.\nthis bill having received the requisite\nconstitutional majority is therefore\npassed what purpose does\nrepresentative cannon rise to make a\nmotion state your motion i'd like to\nmove that\non the next legislative day this bill\nwill be reconsidered by\nare you making a motion that you're\nserving notice\nof your intent to ask for\nreconsideration on the next legislation\nyes i am\nso that's so noted\nand it will be on the next legislative\nday's calendar\nclerk will read the caption to house\nbill 839\nhouse bill 839 by representative thomas\nthe 39th to be entitled an act to\nincorporate the city of mapleton this\nbill ever referred to the committee on\ngovernmental affairs that committee\nrecommends that this bill do pass by\ncommittee substitute\nchair recognizes representative erica\nthomas\nto present the bill\nthank you mr speaker\ni know that the hour is late and so i'm\nnot going to tarry long on this bill\nbut it is very important that i speak\nfor the citizens of my district\nhb\n839 is the proposal of the city hood of\nmableton\nmableton cityhood would give us local\ncontrol over vital elements of committee\ncommittee community building excuse me\nsuch as zoning community development and\nthat in turn will give the community\ngreater autonomy over what happens in\nour community\npeople believe right now that mabelton\nis already a city\ni've had so many people come to me and\nand think that it is already a city\nand my people\nwant to bring local control closer to\ntheir district\nat this moment um we have a county\ncommissioner that is over\nour unincorporated\npart of\nof cobb county which means that that is\none\ncommissioner to 186\n000 people\nthis bill would bring it closer to us\nputting one\ncity council member to 13 000 people\ncityhood would give mableton residents\ncloser to their government like i said\nbefore in this bill the mayor\nwould be duly elected by the citizens it\nwould be six city council members which\nwould make it a weak mayor and the mayor\nis also duly elected\nby the people\nnow\na feasibility study that was presented\nthree years ago which get which which\nwas able to give\nthe citizens of mableton three years to\ndo about 16 different town halls we also\ndid a study on\nour website\nthe south cobb alliance's website\nletting people give their opinion on\nwhat services they wanted and of course\nthey said they wanted sanitation\nand waste management they wanted zoning\nthey wanted economic development they\nwanted\ncommunity development and that is what\nwe wanted to give them the feasibility\nstudy was presented by the university of\ngeorgia's carl vinson institute\nand\nthe study said that we would have a\nsurplus of 3233.64\nwhich would make us in the black\nthe last thing that i will say on this\nbill is that\nwe are state representatives and i think\nthat is so important that representative\nname and that we let\nthe people be able to\npick this at the ballot be able to go to\nthe ballot and say whether they want the\ncity hood or whether they don't want the\ncity hood and that is exactly what this\nbill is doing\num mr speaker i think that i explained\nit is to in a great extent\nand i would ask that everyone in this\nchamber would vote in favor of the city\nof mableton and what you are voting for\nis saying that\ni want the people to be able to vote\nfor whether or not they would like the\ncity of mableton even though they\nbelieve that the city is already a city\ni\nwill yield for questions well like two\nquestions mr speaker\nand i'm not going to ask\nthank you i was going to ask who it was\nbut i didn't want to
