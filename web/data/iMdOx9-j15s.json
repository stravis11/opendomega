  "transcript": "All members, all members, please come to the floor. Good Wednesday morning. Good to see you all this morning because the hour, the hour, the convene, have it arrived. All members will please come to the floor. All members come to the floor and take your seats. Mr. Clerk, will you ring the bell? Good morning again. We're going to have the morning roll call. All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber. Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines? All members voted. All members voted. All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machines? Doors keep us. We will begin our day with scripture reading prayer by our chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 48th House District, Representative Scott Hilton. Chairman Hilton. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Your committee on information, sorry, I've got the wrong. That's the wrong thing. Hold on. Good morning, colleagues. God is good. Amen. The Hebrew word for peace is Shalom, and with two days remaining in the legislative session, there is no better person to bring us some Shalom than Rabbi Hershey Minkowitz. I'll say he shared with me in his house they have 11 children. So I'm guessing he has very little Shalom in his house, but he's going to bring some to this house today. In the summer of 1998, Rabbi Hershey Minkowitz was sent to Alfreda by the Chabad movement. Lady from the 51st, I'm getting a thumbs up. Thank you. A subsection of the Orthodox Jews to establish a Jewish worship and educational center for a growing Jewish community in North Fulton. Rabbi Hershey, as he's affectionately known, leads the Chabad of North Fulton until this day. Their center has become a primary address where Jews of all walks of life and religious backgrounds gather for Jewish enrichment and inspiration. Colleagues, please join me in welcoming Rabbi Hershey. Thank you. Good morning. A friend of mine recently told me that he took one of those private space tours to go see the moon. And when he came back, he told me, would you believe it? They even have a restaurant out there. I asked him, how was the food? He said the food was delicious, but the atmosphere was terrible. I hope you won't mind if I'm going to give you a brief two-minute spiel about the moon. I'm not an astronomer. There was not in the bio that Representative Hilton just read. It's just that next weekend we're going to be celebrating Passover. On April 12th, the Jewish community is going to be celebrating Passover. Interestingly, last year in 2024, Passover began on April 24th, 12 days later than this year. And in 2023, Passover began on April 5th. So why does it fluctuate? Let me quickly tell you the last five years since 2020 and see if you can detect the pattern. 2020, Passover started on April 8th, March 27th, 22nd, April 15th, 23rd, April 5th, 24th, and this year, April 12th. Every year Passover gets 11 or 12 days earlier than the year before, and then every two or three years, it gets set back a month ahead. Why is that? Well, in the book of Exodus, chapter 12, just before the Jews were leaving Egypt, God told the Israelites that from that point forward, they would begin keeping their calendar based on the cycle of the moon. Every month when a new moon appears, it's a new moon appears, it's a new month. Passover is always going to be on the 15th day of the first month when the moon is the fullest. And then in Exodus, chapter 13, verse 4, as the Jews are leaving the shackles of bondage behind, God says to them, and I quote, today you are going out in the month of spring. Rather than focusing on the name of the month, God is focused on the season, the fact that we're going out in the spring. So much so that later in Deuteronomy, just before the Israelites are about to enter into the promised land, God gives them a very firm reminder about how important it is to keep the holiday of Passover in the month of spring. Deuteronomy 161, you shall keep the month of spring and make the Passover offering to the Lord your God for in the month of spring, the Lord your God brought you out of Egypt. Sounds easy enough. However, to just one small problem, and that's why the holiday date varies every single year. You see the lunar calendar, the calendar that goes according to the cycle of the moon has 354 days, 11 days less than a solar calendar of 365 days. So every year Passover is going to get 11 days earlier and 11 days earlier. But hold on a second, God told the Jewish people that they have to keep the Passover in the spring. How is that possible if every year it gets 11 days earlier? So after a few months, Passover will end up being in the winter and then in the fall and then in the summer until it came back around again to the spring. Therefore, the Jewish calendar has a very complicated system where every few years we add a leap year, but not a leap year like in the regular calendar where it's one extra day, we add a full month. We end up with a year that has 13 months in a leap year instead of 12. All for this one reason, because Passover always has to be in the spring. So the million dollar question, and that will be the entry point into our prayer today, is why? Why did God care so much that Passover should always fall in the spring? To the point that we tinker with our calendar, to make sure that it stays in the spring, that the holiday of liberation should be always in the month of spring. Well, I'd like to ask you all to rise for prayer now as we pray and reflect on this idea of the spring. Mr. Speaker and the esteemed members of the Georgia State House, our Father in Heaven is teaching us something extremely important about freedom and liberty, the foundations upon which our great republic was founded. What does the spring represent? Honourable Speaker and esteemed members of the House. As we gather today in this chamber, I offer a reflection rooted in the spirit of renewal and hope that comes with the season of spring and the observance of Passover. Passover, a time of remembrance and freedom, invites us to reflect on the journey of the Israelites from bondage to liberation. It is a season that marks not only the liberation of people, but also the renewal of life itself. Just as the plants awaken from their winter rest in the spring, blossoming into vibrant new growth, so too can we embrace the opportunity to renew our commitments to justice, peace, and the well-being of our people. Spring reminds us that from the coldest and darkest of times, life finds a way to bloom again. It is a time to sow seeds of kindness, compassion, and progress for the future. Just as the earth comes alive with new growth, let us also plant the seeds of positive changes in our hearts and in our work, nurturing them with wisdom and care. So let us pray that we in our roles as leaders and servants of the people, draw inspiration from the season of renewal, embracing the promise of new beginnings and the hope that each day offers. Let this time of Passover remind us of our shared humanity, our capacity for transformation, and our duty to lift up those in need. May our work in this house be guided by the spirit of liberation, renewal, and growth, and may it be a fruit for the prosperity and peace for all Georgians, amen. And now please join me in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Thank you. Thank you, Rabbi Hirschby. We appreciate your presence here with us and appreciate your service to your community and to the state. And thank you for that lesson this morning. We're all about history in this historical place here, and we're looking forward to a wonderful Passover. Doorkeepers, you may unlock the doors, memories you may join the Rabbi in the south any room for a photo. And thank you for his service to us here today. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Chairman Hilton, the chair of the Committee on Information Audits has recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Now's the right time. Your Committee on Information Audits has read the journal the previous legislative day, and we have found it to be correct. Chairman Hilton, the chair of the Committee of Information Audits reports that the journal the previous legislative day has been read and found to be correct. Is there any objection to dispense with the reading of the journal, hearing none the reading the journal is dispensed with? Is there any objection to confirmation of the journal, hearing none the journal is confirmed? Mr. Clerk, will you read the resolution establishing the order of visits for the day? Mr. Clerk. Representative Astrachion of the 104th booth following me establishes the order of visits to the first part of the period unanimous consent. Introduction to bills and resolutions, first reading of reference of house bills and resolutions, second reading of bills and resolutions, third reading of passage of uncontested local bills and resolutions, first reading of reference of senate bills and resolutions, warning orders. Is there any objection to the resolution establishing the order of visits for the day, hearing none the resolutions adopted? Members, I have a mission for you if you don't want to hear first readers. So in this out there any room, I just want to take a second to recognize there's a large poster there that some of you came in the south any room saw that poster. This poster is the official FIFA World Cup 2026 poster for the city of Atlanta and the great state of Georgia. Sometime this morning, if you're having a conversation, it would be a great time to do it right now.

It gives me a pleasure to announce that the Morehouse College Intercollegiate Boxing Team is the first HBCU to everyone in the national championship. Applause. This team was started by Jacobi Bell in 2012 and they produced hall lots.

Through the years of hard work and loyal dedication, the Morehouse Boxing Club has been able to compete in the 2025 US IBA national championship last week. Through a lot of adversity, we were able to leave the two belts earned from the national champions from Caleb Hudson and Elijah McLean. We'd like to thank the USB. And there's my time.

Mr. Clerk, will you read their caption to a resolution, House resolution, 8, 7, 8, 878. Mr. Clerk. House resolution, 878 by Representative Oswade of the ninth, stillcocks the 53rd, clipped into the 131st, Willow's the 55th, Chastain of the 7th and others, a resolution, commanding the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline. Members, this has been a priority of this House. Over a number of years, appreciate the House's support on this important issue. And I former member of this House Commission Tanner, he's here with us as well today. But I'm gonna let the gentleman who sponsored the resolution acknowledge all of our guests who are here, Representative Willow, Wade is recognized to speak to the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I appreciate that very much into my colleagues. I think it'd be appropriate if we could rise because we have the honor today to welcome George's First Lady, the best First Lady in these United States, Ms. Marta Camp. Thank you. Amen. It's also my true honor to be able to recognize one of our colleagues, our former member of this body, my predecessor, Kevin Tanner, the Commissioner and Department of Behavioral Health and Disability Services. I'm gonna read this briefly and then I wanna just make a comment and then turn it over to our First Lady. So we are committing the 988 Suicide Crisis Lifeline, whereas behavioral health conditions, including mental and substance use disorders or critical public health issues. And 988 was established to improve access to crisis services in response to the country's growing suicide and mental health crisis care needs. Our First Lady has led in this effort as so is Kevin Tanner. And I also wanna mention the efforts around human trafficking and sex trafficking, the impact of children. That is a contributor to mental health crisis as well. And those folks, those survivors, have finally had a voice and I couldn't be more proud than to let you hear from our First Lady. Thank you. Well, thank you so much. I appreciate all of you. And thank you. I wanna personally thank you for passing the 10th piece of legislation for human traffickers. Not only to help them, but to have harst your penalties on the perpetrators. And I was very honored that Commissioner Tanner asked me to help put the word out on 988 to let everyone know it's okay to not be okay. And I think that's what we would need to remind people everywhere because these tough topics that are hard to talk about, we need to talk about. And every one of you has supported that. And I wanna tell you, from the bottom of my heart, thank you so much for helping so many hard work and for having Georgia and so appreciate all of you. Thank you. Sorry, turn it over to my great buddy, Commissioner Tanner. Thank you, Representative Wade, Speaker. First Lady, I just wanna again echo the thanks for this body for the work that you've done over many years to make this possible. We receive over 20,000 calls a month just in the state of Georgia to the 988 center. We dispatch over 5,000 mobile crisis teams every single month in the state. So, and we have a disproportionate number of those calls coming from rural Georgia and from our agriculture community. So this is something she used throughout the state. In 2023, only 16% of Georgians had heard of 98. A poll that we did recently, 84% of Georgians have now heard of 98. And a lot of that is because of the work that the First Lady's done helping us spread the word. She's obviously very well known in our state and has really led on a lot of key issues. But we're very thankful that she decided to engage on this and Georgians lives are gonna be saved as a result of these efforts. So, First Lady, thank you. Thank you, Representative Wade. And thank you to the Georgia General Assembly for all your work. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. I just want to echo First Lady Marty Kemp, your dedication to the people of Georgia in so many different ways does not go on notice. But especially on 98, 98, 88, working along Commissioner Tanner. And to commitment from this house and to mental health services, the commitment of Governor Kemp. We just can't thank you enough. and have impactful that is to every corner of this state. Every light is say no matter which is zip code, 988, 988 is there and is it ever making a difference. So thank you. House members, thank you all for always supporting these initiatives when it comes to mental health. They couldn't do without us, we couldn't do without them. So thank you all for y'all's commitment as well. Thanks for being here with us this morning. Okay members, as we go through these last couple of days, we just need to remind our friends across the building across the building of a couple of facts. You wanna come up here? Are you going down there? You're closer down there or you could probably bring your members easier down there. So we have a little announcement to remind you of and remind the Senate of. So with that, I'm going to recognize the finest golf team in America, the house golf team right here. So and the gentleman that the champions of golf team and I think he's the coach and the player, your player coach, aren't you? Your player coach, Chairman Powell. Aren't you a player coach? You a player coach on the golf team? Sure. I think the answer's yes. He's a player on about the coach, but he is. Chairman Powell is recognized and our golf team from the house, the gentleman's recognized. Ladies and gentlemen of the house, we are proud to present to you the members, the cup from the governor's cup, that the house is now one for five consecutive years. Oh! Oh! Oh! Just a brief history to this. This was a tournament that was started back in the 90s and it was the Senate versus the House versus the governor's office versus the engineers of Georgia. And we've been playing this continuously around the state in different golf courses. Now, when I say you should be proud of this, your house members and we all take sports very serious, but we have won this trophy more times than not. And this says a lot for one of the greatest sports that's ever been invented and that's the game of golf. This is one of those sports that can be played individually or is team play to be competition or for nothing more than just get out into nature. Because you're not playing against anybody in those people that I've included. The golf is a game that you can cheat on your wife, you can cheat on your taxes, but you don't cheat it golf. Because you're only cheating yourself about playing against par. I think you need to give all the members of the House golf team a round of applause. And for any of you members who play that would like to be put on the waiting list, we'd like to know who you are. And here's to the Senate, the losers again. Some things never change. Kickball, golf. I won't go any further. I didn't say I just said loser again. Thank you members of our golf team. Appreciate y'all's dedication for bringing home the governor's cup again. Absolutely. I know it was a tough job. Y'all really hated going in and playing golf. Thank you members for your attention. We'll move on to the rules calendar. We will on to the rules calendar. Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption to Senate Bill 5? SB 5. Senate Bill 5 by Senator Capatric. And a 30 second. Another is the Meantime Act to amend chapter 46 of title. 33 of the official go to Georgia antenna relating a certification to private review agents. So it's a provide for health insurance,\n\nA Tainary Program that allows for the selective application of reductions. This bill ever furthered the committee on insurance. That committee recommends this bill do pass by Rules Committee Substitute. Representative Lee Hawkins, chairman Hawkins is recognized to present Senate Bill 5. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You have on your desk Senate Bill 5, Substitute is Rule Substitute. These are two bills that you've heard before and have passed through this house. Last year we did what was termed the gold card bill. This is a bill that each and sure shall utilize a reduced requirement for prior approvals. This is based on the history of the provider. The second bill is the Pans and Panda Bill. Thank you all for me with this. This requires insurance coverage for Pans and Panda, which is a very terrifying disease for our young children. Right now, Chela is actually doing clinical studies on this issue. I wish to give a shout out to them and also shout out to Jesse Weithington, who's a director of the healthcare Alliance of Georgia. That Georgia Healthcare Association, rather, for his work in agreement with the words in these two bills. Mr. Speaker, the no questions, are we yield the well? Gentlemen has no questions. Wait, he did have a question last, I represent a lease of Campbell to your left. Gentlemen, we'll take a question. Representative Campbell, yes. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? He does. I'm just trying to clarify. You said we had a change on our desk for this bill. No. You had this fellow on your desk, will substitute. Okay, thank you. I misunderstood. Thank you. Okay, thank you. Gentlemen has no further questions. Thank you, sir. Gentlemen, is yielded well? Is there any objections to the previous question being ordered?

Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules? Here in none, the rules committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none, the report of the committee's agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes, those opposed. We'll vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Attorney for the \u90a3\u500b\u6795 \u6211ila\u6307\u793a,\u60a8\u6c42\u8a0a\u606f\u6559\u6388\u4e5f\u592a\u904a\u884c\u624b. Have all members voted? All members voted if so? Ms. Clerk sorry. Where you lock the machine on the passage of Senate Bill 5, the yeas are 169, the nays are two. This bill having to see the requisite Constitution majority is there for past. Congratulations, Chairman Skoggins. I know this meant a lot to you and thank for your work on this bill. It's a very important bill. Mr. Clerk, we're year in the caption of Senate Bill 173, 173. Senate Bill 173 by Senator McClaurth, 14th and others to be titled. Now to men are three chapter 11, title 9 of the fiscal to Georgia and state of related pleadings and motions, so to authorize move ants to file notices of uncontested motions and spirit courts and state courts. This bill ever further committee on judiciary, that committee recommends to spill due pass by committee substitute. Chairman Stan Gunther has recognized Senate Bill 173, representative Gunther. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Senate Bill 173 addresses judicial inefficiencies by creating a process to deal with uncontested motions. Specifically, if a proper pretrial motion is filed and no objection is filed within 60 days, a notice of uncontested motion can be filed with the judge. If the judge does not rule on that motion within seven days, the motion shall be deemed granted and entered. 173 allows a tolling of that mechanism if a hearing is scheduled by the judge and also allows the chief judge of the circuit to conduct a review if a judge in their circuit does not rule multiple motions within a specific time frame. Finally, Senate Bill 173 requires parties to provide copies and motions to courts as well as to require courts to provide instructions on how parties should provide those copies to the courts. That is the bill. I'll stand for any questions. Gentlemen, have no questions. Thank you. The gentleman is yielded well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here he none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Here he none, the committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here he none, the report of the committee is agreed to. Now, this bill now pass all of those in favor of the passage of the bill. Will bill yes, all of those opposed? Will no, and Ms. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? All members voted this, so Ms. Clerk, will you lock the machine? All the passage of Senate Bill 173, the yeas are 168, the nays are zero. This bill, Henry, see the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate Bill 1717? One seven. Senate Bill 17 by Senator Anna Navarte, the 31st in others to be entitled to amend Article 11 of Chapter 2, Title 20, and Article 10 of Chapter 3, Title 38 of the fiscal to Georgia and Senate relating to public school property and facilities, and statewide first responder building mapping information system. This bill I refer to the committee on education, that committee recommends this bill do pass by rules committee substitute. Representative Holt, first thing is recognized to present the bill, representative person. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is a rule substitute on Senate Bill 17. I'm also known as Ricky's and Alyssa's Law. This is just clarifying language online 57 under the verification for accuracy for the mapping. We just added relevant public safety agencies, school safety personnel and school administrators on the list of people that can sign off on the accuracy annually, so that they've just recently adopted mapping that they can go ahead and sign off on that again. That's the change in the bill and just ask for a favorable consideration and I'll stand for questions. Representative Ramon, up the center out to your left. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does it jam a meal? I will. Thank you. Just really quickly, have there been any providers of this kind of technology and how has it worked in other places? We currently have this in our school safety plans. This is just clearing up language to make sure that if they just recently adopted their mapping that they're using now that's required under our school safety plans, I believe we passed in 23 that the school administrators can sign off on that if there's been no change in the building. Does it do them for their yields? Yes. Just to clarify, so is it the same sort of contractor provider for all of the schools or is it multiple and we're just trying to get them to talk to each other better? I believe the schools can hire different agencies depending on who they want to use. It's probably put out for our RFP. Got it. Thank you. The representative, Chairman Parsons to your left has recognized for a question. Thanks, Speaker. It's a gentleman yield. I do. Yes, I wanted to ask you about section four. It says here that the school systems, each school system will implement this mobile panic alert system capable of and it describes what it's capable of. And then, on the last page, if I can find it here, the last page that it has 74 through 80, it says that the local board of education, the local school systems, local governments and agencies and it goes on saying employees of school boards and education, local schools, schools, and so on will be exempt, will be immune for many civil liability for any damages arising out of the creation of this. I'm just curious, I mean, how serious is it that we would have to provide immunity for them for actually even using it using this mapping that has to be that they are mandated to create? I think if there's any unidentified error in the mapping, it's just helping give coverage to if there's something that something is missing the error in the mapping. Okay. If I may ask one more question. Sure. On the section two part four. I had, and later July 21st, 2026, each public school shall implement the system. And it talks about then says, and then just this is alert and shall integrate with technology used in each public, each local public safety answering point included, including but not limited to next generation 911. I know that we passed legislation earlier this year that allows the state creates the ability for the state to use that, but it has not been actually designed. We haven't done anything in code to say exactly what that 911, the next generation 911 system actually is. We've got a study committee, I think that it's pending to be created for the summer, but it says it'll be, we don't even know what that is, how do we put that in code? It's going to integrate with that if we haven't even described what it is yet. I think it's, I think this is looking forward in case that passes or gets done that this will already be covered. All right. Well, thank you. Thank you for answering that. Gentlemen has one more question. What part did you have a question? Gentlemen's recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does gentlemen yield? I do. To the author, I appreciate the intent of having a school mapping data. One question that did come to mind is how is this information going to be secured? Just because we're creating critically important information, which if by a hacker, if they access that, could that then expose the school to additional vulnerability, speaking again to the immunity aspect of it? Can you provide any additional context with respect to how this information would be protected after it's compiled? Well, it's already protected. This is already, this is, we passed this in the school safety bill. This is just a amendment and cleanup, but all that information protected at the local agencies. I get everything is vulnerable. Additional encryption requirements, things of that nature. That's not written into the bill. I'm sorry. I don't think it's written into the bill, but that's. This is currently happening from our school safety bill. The school safety plans would pass in 23. So whatever is in 23 would be what a pause. Just a note there, then, you know, perhaps again to ensure that this information is protected. Whether it's by rule regulation or additional legislation, that again, we are taking action to ensure that this information cannot be easily accessible. Well, I know, I know it's not subject to open records request. Of course, thank you. But George Lee left, Strasius, recognize for a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Is it Jim and Neil? I do. Sir, is it not true that school records, particularly student records and school security records are subject to protections already? What are the benefits of that information that the school has in the school that's been in the past, which are implemented at the local level to ensure that data, that sensitive records that security information, is secured to the extent that's possible under IT standards from hack or from falling into the wrong hands? That's that. And isn't it true that SB 17 is an effort to make sure that law enforcement and emergency personnel have the information that they need to effectively do their jobs? Bill, you know, is what he speaks. I've never heard of their questions. Thank you. Gentlemen, is he old enough to see, take another question. Are you the well? Gentlemen, is he old to the well? We do have a speaker on the bill. Representative Betsy Haaland is recognized to speak to the bill. Representative Haaland, give the lady your attention please. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I rise today in support of SB 17. As most of you know, I have a middle schooler at home. And many of you got to meet him on Cross Over Day when he was living his best life as a page all the way till 11 o'clock when we got to go home. having a middle schooler gives me a different perspective on school safety measures. Fire drills and tornado drills were the norm for most of us growing up. Active shooter drills and lockdowns have been the norm for him since kindergarten. I can't explain what the emotion is when you're on a group text with other school parents. And someone text and says the school is on lockdown. Does anyone know why? And it doesn't feel like you breathe until somebody responds back and says it was a false alarm or I've heard the all clear. When the shooting happened at Appalachia High School last fall. When the shooting happened last fall, I waited a day or two before I asked my child if he had heard the news and asked him how it felt. I asked him if it made it feel scary or if it made him feel anxious. And he said no mom, that school only had one resource officer. Our school has two when an active shooter comes we're going to be better prepared. That was the day I realized that my child uses the word when, not if, when he thinks about an active shooter coming to his school. I sometimes have heartburn about the details in these school safety bills but I've put that aside and hoping I can just tell my child that we will make sure his school is prepared as possible if a bad actor comes on campus. I wish with all my heart I could go home tonight and say what we did today was past meaningful gun safety reform to try to prevent school shootings in the first place. But we'll get there. We're just not there today. Instead I'll go home and say once again we did everything we could to try to make sure his school was safe if a bad actor should ever come on campus. I will be supporting this bill and I ask you and join me in doing the same. Thank you. Thank you. The lady is you and the well. Is there any objection to the previous question in order. Here in none your previous questions is ordered is there any objection to withdrawing the committee substitute here in none the committee substitute is withdrawn? Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee own rules here in none the rules committee substitute is adopted. is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Hearing none the report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes, all those opposed. We'll vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? All in the passage of Senate Bill 17, the yeas are 171 to nays or zero. This bill, I have received a requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption to Senate Bill 131, 131? Senate Bill 131 by Senator Hodges III, another to be titled an act to amend chapter 10 to title 49. In the fish go to Georgia and attend it, relate the Georgia Board of Healthcare Workforce. So, as a reply for the establishment of the Georgia Healthcare Professional Status System. This bill, I would like to read the committee unregulated in the streets. That committee recommends this bill do pass by rules committee substitute. Chair, lady Keef's, Katie, excuse me, Katie, I know you. Katie Dips is recognized to present the bill. Ladies recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You have on your desk rules substitute to Senate Bill 131, the language from the previous bill has been replaced. This is the exact language, exact measure that we voted on on March 3rd and passed this House by a vote of 170 to 2. It was House Bill 612, which deals with parity, a very important issue to this House always. It does two things, basically. It will add the commissioner, the insurance commissioner, as a member of the Behavioral Health Coordinating Council. And it will also establish a parity compliance review panel of 10 who will be able to help us move the ball forward on parity. There is great concern that reports are not reaching the place where we need them to be. So, it will serve as data collection and have the opportunity for this panel to develop the reporting system that will actually help them evaluate the reported concerns. Mr. Speaker, that is what it does. If there are any questions, I'll be glad to take them. If not, I will yield the well. The lady has a question, will part to your left right in front. The gentleman is recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair Lady Dems, I look forward to voting yes for this bill. A quick question that on lines 95 and 96 as I've been doing an additional review. It says this new panel will have no authority to impose financial penalties. I recognize the effort to create an incentive to report as opposed to a penalty. However, in the event that we continue to see a lack of reporting even with these sorts of incentives and efforts to encourage, is there some sort of enforcement mechanism or a state agency that could proceed with enforcement if, again, parity is not being met? The panel will be under the auspices of the behavioral health system. As I understand it, they will be reviewing and trying to move that forward. I do not believe that they will establish the procedures and policies when they get started. So, that is how I understand the measure. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, ma'am. I would like to ask a lady for another question. Yes, ma'am. Representative Oliver to your left. Does recognize for a question? Does the lady you? Yes, I certainly do. The purpose of this bill is to highlight and bring forward real data. We're not getting that data in a consistent way from the insurance commissioner as we mandated in 10-13. So, this is a good step forward, isn't it, true? To bring the data forward, we can really understand who is going to compliance and who is not in compliance with true parity as required by law. The lady is correct and knows exactly of what she speaks. Thank you. Lady has no further questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well and ask for your favorable support once again to move this ball forward. The lady has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to withdrawing the committee's substitute? Here in none, the committee's substitute is withdrawn. Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on the rules? Here in none, the rules committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none, the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes, those opposed. Will vote no, and Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? No. No. No. No. Have all members voted. All members voted if so, Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? All the passage of Senate Bill 131, the yeas are 166. The nays are three. This bill, I understand, is a constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Members out, hope you'll help me welcome a former member of this house, Ripsley-Franmalar. He did go to the dark side. He did go to the dark side, but he's still a pretty good guy, so let's make, let's make Fran welcome back to the chamber he got. He will initiate in the end right here. Hope reigns eternal. He came back to his roots, never doubt about that, let's see. Members, we'll take up a couple of, um, agrees and disagrees. This one would be in a agree. Representing McCollum is recognized for a motion. Representing McCollum. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I approve that the House agree to the Senate substitute to 8B575. Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption, please? House will 575 by Representative McCollum of the 30th to be entitled, next to amend Title 32, the fiscal to Georgia antenna related highways, bridges and ferries, those to authorize. Notice of certain public hearings both as a Department of Transportation by Electronic Publication. Her representative McCollum is recognized to explain his motion and the Senate substitute. 8B575 is the exact bill that we passed out of the House except for they changed in committee lines 109 to 1111. The Senate decided to change the language which impede the flow of traffic is determined and requested by the Department of Public Safety law enforcement and designated fire department personnel, the Department agreed. I'll stand for any questions. The gentleman has no questions. Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to say I didn't have to get any help from the gallery this time or freeze up. As I told you last time, we're both the working progress. Yes, sir. And I yield the well. Gentlemen, yield to the well. Good job.

Mr. Speaker, I move that we agree to the Senate substitute of House Bill 94. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? House Bill 94, by the way, Representative Lomston to the 12th being titled an act to amend chapter 24, title 33. The fish go to Georgia, Antietta, relating insurance generally so as to require coverage for certain expenses for standard fertility preservation services. Representative Lomston is recognized to explain the Senate substitute to House Bill 94. Chairman Lomston. Mr. Speaker, members, House Bill 94 is a bill that we passed out prior to crossover. It's the fertility preservation bill. The only change that was made in the Senate was they removed all state plans from the coverage, which we thought we had that cover when we sent it over to them. There was something that was found there. So the Senate substitute simply removed the coverage in the state plans. Gentlemen, yield. I yield. Will Park is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Lomston. Can you thank you for explaining the change? Can you help me understand why state plans were removed for purposes of this health benefit? Generally, when we are dealing with insurance related coverage, particularly as it pertains to the state of Georgia, the cost to the state of Georgia, that had not been worked out. So the private plans are okay with this. So all this is doing is applying to the private plans. We'll work on that part of it as we go into the next session. Thank you, sir. Representative Silcox. Chair Lady Silcox, right up the center aisle. On your right is recognized for a question. Does the gentleman yield? I do. Isn't it true that this will allow him and who have suffered terribly from all kinds of cancer to still have children? Yes, that's the entire purpose. Thank you so much.

So you said that the bill is amended by the Senate no longer manages state health benefit plans. It only applies to private health insurance plans. Correct. In my understanding of how a RISIL law works, do we have the power to regulate private? Yes.\n\nIt's not a risk of plans. Non-risk of plans. OK. Thank you. How you overweat? Gentlemen, gentlemen, the well. On the gentleman's motion that the House agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 94, all those in favor will vote. Yes, those opposed will vote.

Who represents the Lumston has recognized to explain the Senate's substitute and the House amendment? The gentleman's recognized. Mr. Speaker, House Bill 182 is the same as House Bill 410, which is a Department of Insurance. Clean up bill, this is a bill that we passed out unanimously a few weeks ago, 164 to 0. We removed the original portion of 182 and the amendment is the same as House Bill 410.
