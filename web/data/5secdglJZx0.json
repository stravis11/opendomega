Have all members voted All members voted. All members voted if so. This clerk will you lock the machine? Doors will you please close the doors and keep them closed? Members before we go into our chaplain of the day, I want to, some of you may not be aware of this, but you know, the good Lord has blessed us in so many ways in this state and this country to have natural friends or friends from nature, I'll say. And there are many, there are any number of iconic mascots in this state, but I want to tell you some sad news. Freedom, the Georgia Southern Eagle, passed away this weekend. So this house will have a resolution honoring freedom, but what a great mascot freedom was here last week, I believe it was. So I want to, I just want to ask you all to certainly what an iconic symbol of America, but how blessed we've been in this state to be to been able to have a an eagle as a part of our family here in this state and not just in higher ed at Georgia Southern, but representing the values that we're proud of in this country. And I know many of you have had your photos made with freedom over the years and he was quite the actor, but I want to just say to you, I know of freedom in a lot to a lot of people and it does mean a lot to a lot of people. Freedom as we enjoy the great freedoms this country, but I want to ask you to remember Steve Hines. Steve has been there with freedom, oh, his years at Georgia Southern. Steve is the gentleman that many of you have attended, have had the pleasure and the honor and the great opportunity to handle some snakes down in our wildlife center at Georgia Southern. And Steve is the one that helped put all of that together, but really the crowning piece of the wildlife center and and for Steve has been his relationship with freedom. And he is pretty devastated job because he found freedom Saturday morning. And so thoughts and prayers go out if you will, Steve Hines and his family. And for a moment of silence, if you will, remember a great gift that God has given to us. Thank you members. Very much appreciated. As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the lady from the 53rd House District representing Debra Silcox. Thank you so much, Mr. Speaker. It is with great delight that I bring to you this morning my pastor, Dr. Rich Conwacher. He is the eighth senior pastor of Peachtree Presbyterian Church here in Atlanta. He has been a pastor for over 25 years and has served congregations in Texas, California and the New York City Metro area. He studied at Trinity, undergrad in San Antonio and completed his master's in Princeton and his doctorate at Fuller Theological Seminary. He has been honored to serve on the Board of Trustees for all three of those institutions and he is currently a Board of Directors at the historic Fox Theatre here in Atlanta. We are honored also to have with him this morning, his wife Kelly, she is right here. And Kelly and Dr. Rich actually met in seminary. They fell in love debating theology and eating ice cream as a reward after an evening in the library. Kelly is the founder of Optup Consulting and is passionate about empowering momentum for organizations and noble causes. They have two daughters. One is at the University of Georgia and the other one is Dr. Rich's alma mater Trinity University. Rich loves to read, swim and run. If you really want a great story, ask him about his Holom one and golf. Dr. Rich Conwacher. I will be half of a grateful state. We are so glad that you are helping to secure the safety of our children. We are also grateful for your faithful stewardship and finally getting to a budget. We are grateful for both of those things. Instead of me offering you words in four and a half minutes that you will likely forget before your second vote. Let me share with you some of the most enduring and durable words in history from maybe the greatest speech that was ever given. When Jesus walked up a mountainside next to the Sea of Galilee, these are excerpts of the famous sermon on the Mount. Where Jesus said, Blessed are the poor and spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. And blessed are those who mourn for they will be comforted. Blessed are the meek for they will inherit the earth. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they will be filled. Blessed are the pure and heart for they will see God. Blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called children of God. And blessed are you. When people insult you, revile you and hate you because of me for in the same way they hated the prophets who were before you. Because you are salt in the earth but if the salt is lost at saltiness, how can it ever be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything but to be thrown out and trampled under foot. You are the light of the world. No one ever lights a lamp and then puts it under a basket but on a stand so that it gives light to all in the house. And so in the same way, let your light now shine before others so that they may see your good deeds and give glory to your father in heaven. For do not think that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets. I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. Be careful not to practice your righteousness before others in order to be seen by them. If you do, you have no reward from your father in heaven. And so therefore I tell you do not worry about your life. What you will eat, what you will drink, about your body, what you will wear is not life more than food and the body more than clothing. Look at the birds of the air. They did not so or re-pergather into barns and yet your heavenly father feeds them. Are you not much more valued than they? And by your worry can you add one single hour to the span of your life? And why do you worry about your clothing? Consider the flowers of the field how they grow. They do not labor, they do not spend and yet I tell you Solomon in all of his glory was not clothed like one of these. And if God so close the grass of the field which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire will he not much more cloth you owe you of little faith. If we do not worry saying what will we eat, what will we drink, what will we wear for it's the pagans who run after all these things and your heavenly father knows that you need them. And so seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all of these things will be given to you as well. Do not worry about tomorrow. Tomorrow will take care of itself each day has enough trouble of its own. And do not judge or you too will be judged for in the same way you judge others you will be judged and with a measure you use it will be measured to you. Why do you look at the speck of sawdust and your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank that is in your own eye? You hypocrite first remove the plank that is from your own eye and then you will see clearly to help your brother with the speck that is in his eye. Ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and the door will be open to you. And so when everything due to others as you would have them due to you for this sums up the law and the prophets. And so enter through the narrow gate for broad as the way why does the road that leads to destruction and many will enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and only if you find it. Therefore if you are a wise person you will build your house on the rock and the rains fall and the floods came and the winds blew and beat against that house but it did not fall because it had its foundation upon the rock. But anyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on the sand and the rains fall and the floods came and the winds blew and beat against that house and it fell with a great crash. And when Jesus had finished these words they were amazed at his teaching for he taught them as one who had real authority not like their regular teachers of religion like the pastor who's standing here today. May these words inspire us for generations to come and so will you stand with me and let us pray. A gracious and loving Father we are so grateful for the opportunity that is before us. May we begin with the blessing. May we hear your call to be salt to preserve what is good in this world and to be light that shines in the darkness. Lord we are not here to abolish the past but to stand on the shoulders of giants of the promise. We do not do what we do in order to be noticed and to be seen and to be recognized by others and so help us to set aside our fears, our worries, our doubts, our insecurities. Strip away all of our judgment and our hypocrisy and may we now seek first the kingdom of God where we do to others as they do to us. And so may you impress upon these your servant leaders to walk the narrow path, to do the hard thing, to not follow the ways of this culture in this world but to do what is difficult for what is right. May we build the foundation of the state of Georgia upon the rock of wisdom of eternal words as we care for the state that you've entrusted to us.\n\nto us for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation in the God indivisible with liberty and justice. The door keepers you may open the doors. Dr. Rich and Kelly thank you for being here. Thank you for those words. Come back up and join me if y'all will and we're going to follow members.

Members, I would love to have your attention. A former member of this House is with us today, but I want to recognize her first as a former member, and then we're going to recognize her again in just a minute. But Rimsley-Villain Ryley served in this House with distinction, and I want you all all to stand and help me welcome Lynn Ryley back to the place she called home, the People's House. Thank you. Thank you members. We do have an invite resolution. We have a couple of them, and I'll ask for your attention over the next few minutes, because we honor some very special Georgians. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Resolution 850? House Resolution 850 by Representative Smartner, 49th Burns, 159th Jones, 47th, DEMPSY 13, Smith, 70th, and others, a resolution, recognizing and commending Lynn Ryley on the occasion of her retirement. Chairman Martin has recognized to speak to the resolution and to this fine ladies' career, Chairman Martin. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen of the House and Mr. Speaker. I'll attempt to speak to this resolution and tell you there's no way I can stand before you and speak to the totalitarian, the total amount that she has met in North Walton County. Commissioner Representative Commissioner, State Treasurer and President Ryley has met so much to our area in North Walton County in the state of Georgia over the last 21 years. Yes, she served as a county commissioner, a member of this body, the First Female Revenue Commissioner of the State of Georgia, the First Female State Treasurer of the State of Georgia, and is currently retiring from Georgia as the President of the Student Finance Commission. She has done so much with her leadership talents, her remarkable patience and diplomacy, and keen vision. Her sensitivity to the needs of Georgia is beyond anything I've ever experienced. And that's just what she did for me while she was working with us on the higher ed committee. You're supposed to laugh with me at that, she helped me. Now in seriousness, down here you meet a lot of people that are good personally, you know, they're good with people, they're good technically, some weren't well in a team, some are great leaders, some no specific areas, others are generalists. I have never met anyone and I stand before you today and truthfully say I've never met anyone that does all those things and more. I could spend the next little while telling you about President Commissioner Treasurer and Representative Lynn Riley, but I think it would be best if the Speaker would allow to hear from her on the occasion of her retirement from 21 years of public service for Fulton County and the great State of Georgia. Would you all help me welcome?\n\nOur former colleague, Lynn Raleigh. APPLAUSE Thank you so much. APPLAUSE Thank you all very much. Thank you, Mr. Speaker for inviting me here today. Chairman Martin, my good friend, Chuck. Madam Pro Tem, my very good friend. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Speaker for inviting me here today. Chairman Martin, my good friend, Chuck. Madam Pro Tem, my very good friends, and all the members of the Chamber. Thank you for the privilege to serve with many of you, to work with all of you. And the great things that you have been able to advance in this amazing state of Georgia. I'm thrilled to have spent all the times we have together finding good things to do for the citizens of this state. And I'm very proud to have been able to work with each of you in that regard. I'm not saying goodbye. I'm just leaving the state in great hands and very proud of that. And hoping that I can benefit now is a private citizen of all the amazing things you do. Thank you every day for your leadership, your sacrifices, and everything you do to make Georgia the best state in the nation to live, work, and thrive. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you, Lynn Riley, for your years of service to our state. But we know there's a gentleman here with us as well. I want to introduce him to the members this morning, this up in the gallery that would be filling those big shoes. Chris Green, thank you for standing up and taking over. We've done an awesome job working with Lynn and we appreciate you and look forward to working with you in the future. And thanks for being here with us.

Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House resolution 849, 849? House resolution 849 by Representative Hitchens 161st, a resolution recognizing and commanding Trooper first class mapes. Thank you members. We have a special resolution honoring this young Trooper this morning. So members, will please give your attention to Chairman Bill Hitchens, Chairman Hitchens. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I come today to honor somebody who's been honored in many other areas of our country already. But this is the first time he's been honored in our state. On last November, TFC mapes and Trooper Cadet South were on patrol in Connoors, Georgia. When they had a car come through the radar at 100 3 miles an hour. They gave pursuit, didn't go very far. And the car that they were chasing got in a racing contest with another car. And when the blue lights came on, they went in a separate direction. They followed the initial car, went up the ramp and Connoors. They tried to dodge the Troopers pulled into gas station and the Troopers pulled in the other side and blocked them. Both of them got out the car and ran on foot. Trooper mapes chased a passenger and Trooper Cadet South chased the driver. All of a sudden Trooper mapes found that he was in the field of fire for several bullets. And he got struck and he couldn't fire back because people in the gas station were behind him. And he couldn't fire for fear of maybe hitting one of them. Subsequently, he went to the side and Trooper South heard the gunshots. He'd gone in a different direction. So he came back to help. And after he went off to the side, he had an open shot and mapes shot the perpetrator who continued on. But together they ran him down and they arrested him. Both people were convicted felons. They were intoxicated and they both had weapons. Subsequently, that Trooper mapes was nominated for the Trooper of the Year for the Southern District of the International Subchase of Chiefs of Police, which he won. And then he was entered into the contest for the National Trooper of the Year, along with a trooper from Vermont, one from Missouri, and one from Idaho. And he was the National winner. So Trooper mapes is the National Trooper of the Year for the United States. He's got quite a history. You all know I was in the Marines and I've been very passionate about my prior experience with some of you out here who were in Army. And it hurts my mouth to say this, but he's a veteran of the United States Army too. I think the Colonel would like to say something first. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Speaker for having us here today. And I just wanted to say something very briefly, but a lot of people we ask us, why do we train the way we do? Should we not lower our standards of training? Once you hear this type of action happen, that's why we train the way we do. It's easy for Trooper mates to fill that pain in his side, turn around and go about his business and go back. But he saw that there were citizens at another gas station where this guy, armed guy, was going. And he knew that it was him that had to stand up and take action to prevent those people from getting injured or possibly killed. And we just want to say, be thinking about Madison Taylor. They had to hear about this. Their husbands were in a gunfight and hear about that and look at their both okay, but they are stalwarts for their family. And we just want to say thank you. But as people like this, when evil raises our head, as people like this, it stand up and stand in the gap and keep us safe. So thank you very much. And I don't know whether he wants to or not, but on my ass Trooper mates, he gave a pretty good speech at the IACP conference in Orlando. So both of my college graduates mates went to North Georgia College and South went to Georgia Southern. So Trooper mates, we'd like to say a few words. Sure, thanks. Or even if you don't. But more than everyone, I want to say first off, thank you for having us here. Thank you for honoring us in this big way. I heard it pretty well while we're down at the IACP conference. This profession for us is a calling. It's not something that we do for paycheck. It's not something we do because it's a necessity. It's something that we were called to do. And for me, Logan was my cadet at the time. And I can't thank him enough for being there for me. And I know that the way that I am, the way that he is. This is truly what we're supposed to do, what we're meant to do in this world. Thank you for having our back. Thank you for having us around.

The official go to Georgia and annotate a relayed in optometrist so as to provide for doctors of optometry that dispense and sell pharmaceutical agents from to patients under certain conditions. Justice Bill Ember for the Committee on Health. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by Committee substitute. Chair recognizes floor leader Gamble to present the bill. Thank you, Madam Speaker. Senate bill 140 seeks to amend Georgia Law to enable optometrist to be able to dispense and sell medications to their patients. The bill enables optometrist to sell any medication that they are able to currently prescribe with the exception being for anything that is a controlled, dangerous substance. This would be limited to medications that are for treatment of the eye and the ocular adnexam. There are many goals of what we're trying to accomplish with this. Number one is that we'll make it more convenient for patients who are interested in purchasing medications and wish to do so from their optometrist to office. They would still be able to purchase medication from a pharmacy if they chose to do so. Often times optometrists carry certain medications that the pharmacies don't have access to in their offices. And again, this would just enable optometrist to sell those medications to patients. This is a good bill that was worked on between the optometrist association and the Georgia Pharmacy Association. And I would ask for your favorable consideration and we'll yield for any questions. I have a couple of questions representing part Ken and to your left has recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Do you yield? I yield. You said that there were a number of things that were solving with this legislation. Can you speak a little bit more to those maybe an incident that's taking place? A problem we're solving here just some more information? Yes. So in many cases, a patient will be prescribed one of these medications that an optometrist would carry. And it might be that the pharmacy has closed and they don't have access to get the medication. So this would be more of a convenience if anything else to allow them to purchase those products from the optometrist in their office. Again, they still have the option to buy from a pharmacy, but they would just be able to do that in an optometrist's office as well. So with that, Mr. Speaker, I will ask for this body's favorable consideration and yield the well. Gentlemen, as you were to the well, I had a couple more questions, but the gentleman's yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Here in none, the committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none, the report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the pass to the bill? We'll vote yes, all those opposed. We'll vote no, Mr. Clerk. Will you unlock the machine? All members voted. All members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine. All in the past, if Senate Bill 140, 140, the yeas are 166. The nays are zero. This bill hasn't seen it. The constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate Bill 93, 93? Senate Bill 93, by Senator Campbell, 38. The others to be followed.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I have Senate Bill 93, which is a companion bill to House Bill 307 that passed both chambers earlier this year. This ensures Georgia teachers are being trained in alignment with our science of reading standards. It works to strengthen our efforts to end the reliance on the three queuing practice. And it supports our teachers by making sure they are ready to teach reading to our children on day one in the classroom. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And colleagues, I ask your favorable consideration. If there are no questions, I will yield the well. The lady has no questions. Thank you, I yield. Well, is there any, the lady's yielded the well. There is a someone who's signed up to speak in favor of the bill. Representative Park Cannon has recognized to speak to the bill. Representative Cannon. All right. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, members. I am rising in support of this measure. And grateful for our senators who supported this bill, proposed this bill, and got it through committee. I, as a preschool teacher, really feel as though this bill helps to prepare our teachers for ensuring that we're giving them the best tools that they need to teach children across Georgia to read. I know that there are a few of us in here who have most recently been Georgia students. And we went through a time period where learning how to read was a fun thing. We used to, if you remember, get pizza parties on Friday. We used to get special points if we did the best reading. And somehow we have lost our way in the state of Georgia. We here need to remind ourselves that only 70% up to 70% of our students are not reading on grade level. And our teachers have come to us to say that they believe the reasons why is because the ways in which that we are teaching. And so this is a bipartisan piece of legislation. You know, it has been exciting to see teachers show up and speak to this legislation here. I hope that you'll be joining us in voting in support of this bill and giving our teachers the best opportunity that they can to help our children read. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Thank you for your comments. Ladies, you are the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in none, the previous question is ordered.

The Senate is a cracker of 30 seconds and others to be tauted and act to amend tauted. 15 in the fiscal day to go to Georgia and today relating to courts so as to provide for arrest warrant requirements when juvenile courts are acting as courts of inquiry. This bill has been referred to the committee on judiciary juvenile. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair, lady, your mandate bellinger is recognized to present the bill. Representative bellinger. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of SB 8. SB 8 clarifies existing statutory authority of the juvenile court to act as a court of inquiry. In the issuance of arrest warrant based upon probable cause by aligning the juvenile code with procedure for other such courts codified in Title 17. A court of inquiry is best understood as a descriptive term for a court with factual investigatory powers and the powers to summon and examine witnesses and evidence for that purpose. Section 1 adds a new subsection to the existing statutory framework contained in OCGA 15117 for the issuance of arrest warrants to cross reference and restate applicable provisions in Chapter 1 of Title 17. Section 2 adds a new subsection to OCGA 15186.1 to mere provisions applicable to other courts of inquiry which preserve the role of prosecuting authorities to represent the state in the appropriate class of court with jurisdiction over alleged offenses. Section 3 eliminates conflict in existing statutes by adding juvenile judges to the enumerated judges authorized by Title 17 to issue an arrest warrant based on probable cause. Section 4 adds juvenile court judges to those enumerated who may conduct courts of inquiry. That is the bill. You all received a letter from the Council of juvenile court judges. We believe that they have no objection to the bill to SB 8, so we believe it reaffirms existing law. We're basically restating existing law and moving it from one section to another. I mean, were they happy to yield any questions? I think that's the last. Lady has a couple of questions and then we have a speaker on the bill. I got to live it early while I go with Representative Oliver is going to speak to the bill. Representative Miller is for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the General Lady yield? I do. Can you speak a little bit to what it was that necessitated this expansion of arrest powers? My concern I'll just share is that juvenile judges are typically not elected judges. They're appointed judges. And so why would we be giving them the same authority that we give to superior court judges to make these decisions? They already have that authority as the letter from the juvenile court judges stated. It's not an expansion of their powers. You're just restating and clarifying the powers that already exist in statute. And the reason that we're doing that is there was some problems whenever juvenile court judges would issue warrants. They had some problems in actually getting the sheriff's to execute them and things like that. So this is why we had to have the bill. I took clarify those issues and to make sure that everybody understood this explicit powers that were already there for our juvenile court judges. But just restate them and clarify them for everyone else. Does the lady further yield? Have you during the course of preparing this bill or championing this bill, spoken to superior court judges to see what their take is? I regularly speak with many superior court judges and none of them have expressed any concerns about this. As they are the ones that usually generally speaking appoint the juvenile court judges. So they're very interested in making sure that the warrants and the actions of the juvenile court judge are very reflective upon this superior court judges. And they have a lot of confidence in those judges. So no, they had no opposition. Thank you. I have received several calls from superior court judges who are opposed to this expansion. Thank you. Lady Yill for another question. I guess sir. Representative Rice to your left. Is Rick. Way to your left is recognizing us for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the general lady Yill? Yes. Is it not true this bill ensures that our legal statutes operate cohesively, thereby strengthening the administration of justice in Georgia? It does. Thank you, lady. Thank the lady for the question. If there are no further questions. If you have one question in front of you and this will be your last question, then we have to have a speaker. Sure. Leader, illustration right in front of you to your right is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is the general lady Yill? Hi, Dan. I'm not sure that by specifying the warrant requirements for juvenile courts, acting as a court of inquiry, this bill actually enhances the procedural clarity and provides consistency within our judicial system. That is true and that's the purpose of the bill. Thank you for bringing the bill. Excellent. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, I yield for any more questions. You have one more question if you want to take it, then we have a speaker. Okay. Mr. President, you have a question, Mr. President Cannon. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Do you yield? I do. Thank you, Madam Chair. So, would this bill possibly permit defects in having more investigatory powers? Like, will they... This in no way impacts the powers that defects has or does not have. Okay, and further inquiry. So, will defects not be able to get arrest warrant than with us? If the juvenile court judge sees... If somebody approaches the juvenile court judge or the juvenile court judge hears of a criminal act, then the juvenile court judge will be able to issue the warrant. That is something that they can already do. Many of them sit actually as superior court judges by special designation in a lot of instances in various counties across the state. There are 159 of them, so every 159 of them is a little bit different. But there is no expansion or anything like that of the powers currently being exercised by our juvenile court judges. So, defects has investigatory powers, though. I believe... I mean, they get referred to all the child abuse cases, and they are meant to investigate those.\n\nSo they do have investigative powers already. But this bill doesn't touch, it doesn't enhance or not enhance, it doesn't touch any of the powers of defects. Okay, I'm not sure that I'm asking the question as it is, but from my understanding, I just like to place a concern on the impact that this has on the arrest powers and that's the good, sorry, powers. Yeah, it does not, again, this bill does not expand any of the powers currently exercised by our juvenile court judges. It doesn't enhance their powers, it doesn't give them more powers, it simply clarifies the powers that they do have currently in law. And it also streamlines the processes for better working relationships with our other various courts. Mr. Speaker, if there are no further questions, how we yield the well and ask for your favorable consideration of SB 8. The lady has no further questions. She's yielded the well. Representative Mary Margaret Oliver has recognized the speak and opposition to the bill. I apologize for trying to recognize you earlier, so thank you for your patience. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Whenever I see an expansion of arrest powers, I get a little nervous. I used to be a magistrate court judge and here informed and investigated evidence about issuing arrest warrants. I don't believe that the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court can issue an arrest warrant from his venture, the Corva Pials or the Spear Court, or really any other court that doesn't have a law enforcement investigative arm to help him or her really evaluate the facts before it. We have a dispute among the juvenile court judges right now. This doesn't clarify, this determines that they do have arrest powers from the bench, apparently, to go across jurisdiction lines. In Cam County, I think I had 15 different entities that were doing criminal investigations. There was a lot of jurisdictional issues we had to figure out. And if you're asking a juvenile court judge, giving a juvenile court judge the power in this bill, which I believe you are, to go across criminal jurisdictions then you're creating confusion. Many years ago, we passed a bill that created a child abuse protocol requirement within your counties so that defects was obligated to work with law enforcement and other entities in the county to deal with these kind of cross jurisdictional investigation and problem solving approaches. And I've asked what is the status of our child abuse protocols? Why aren't we using these to resolve local conflict issues? The Council do, but our court judge says this is not their bill. I think it comes from defects in their inability under a confusion or under a determination of a law they don't agree with to make arrest forants and give them more power in the expanding authority they wish to have to do criminal investigations. Mr. Speaker, this is a very dense area. It can be difficult to decipher who has the power to do what, but I felt I wanted to raise the issue of conflicting jurisdictions, conflicting authority and that the power of arrest is a pretty big deal in my book. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. The lady has yielded the well. Thanks to everyone for their questions and their explanation on SB 8. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none, the report of the committee is agreed to. Shout out this bill now passed. All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? I have all members voted. For what purpose is represented Miller? Parliamentary inquiry. Statue inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that this bill would give a juvenile judge in Fulton County unelected the authority to issue an arrest warrant for a child in Effingham County without regard for that judge's respective jurisdiction over Effingham? I'm sure the lady knows. I didn't know she was coming down to Effingham, but that'd be fine too. We'd love to have you down there as soon as I retire. But I'm sure the lady is knowledgeable in what she speaks. And thank you for the inquiry. For what purpose is represented Gullet rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Statue inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that by supporting this bill, we're taking decisive steps forward to harmonizing our state's legal codes and ensure that our courts operate under uniform standards when issuing arrest warrant? I'm sure the gentleman knows of what he states and believes that for what purpose is represented bird rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Statue inquiry. Is it not true this bill is giving defects over reaching authority? I'm sure the lady believes that if that's her statement. For what purpose is leader of stretch and rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Statue inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that in reviewing this bill, I had an opportunity to consult with juvenile court judges who may very clear to me, they already have these powers that they are exercising currently, but there's nothing in law specifying the procedure which Senate Bill 8 will now provide. Based upon that, it's good policy to have an arcade for these circumstances. Sure, the gentleman knows of what he speaks. He does his a practice of attorney as others are in this room. Have all members now voted? We've had a chance to thoroughly vet the bill. Have all members voted if so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the passage of Senate Bill 8, the yeas are a 79, and the yeas are 87, this bill having failed to receive the requisite constitutional majority has therefore failed. For what purpose does leader of stretch and rise? Make a motion. Stage a motion. I move that the House reconsider its action on Senate Bill 8. Since we're in this last week of the session, last three days, we'll take that motion up right now. All of those in favor of reconsidering Senate Bill 8, will vote yes. All those opposed, we'll vote no, Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines? Post- ballots, Response,sorry. Operators, please approve. Have all members voted? All members vote. Have all members voted? All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the gentleman's motion, the yeas are 94. Yeas are 94. The days are 74. The motion carries and the House has reconsidered its action on Senate Bill 8, which will be taking that bill up at a later time. We have a lot of work to get done today, but we're going to take a little break. This House will be in recess for lunch. We'll come back at 1.15, but I'm going to recognize the majority of leader for an announcement. At this time, leader of the administration is recognized for an announcement. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
