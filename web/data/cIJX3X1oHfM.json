and support\npolicies and take measures\nto ensure america's long-term energy of\naffordability security leadership and\nprogress\nthis resolution have been referred to\nthe committee on\neconomic\nenergy utilities and telecommunications\nthat committee recommends that this\nresolution\nbe adopted\nchair recognizes representative donahoe\nto present the resolution\nthank you mr speaker\nladies and gentlemen of the house\ni bring before house resolution 1147\nwe're urging the president of the united\nstates to allow america's long-term\nenergy affordability\nsecurity leadership and progress\nincluding actions that result in the\ncontinued operation of existing oil and\nnatural gas pipelines the construction\nof new pipelines and the end to\nrestricting on developing our nation's\nown short and offshore\nnational resources\nbasically every five years we have a\ncontract where we can lease properties\noffshore and onshore this july we will\nhave that come up to be signed again\nthis pretty much wears all oil and\nnatural gas\nvital components of our nation's economy\nproviding more than 11 million jobs\nnationwide including 247 000 total jobs\n30.8 billion in gross domestic home\nincome of georgia alone\nwhereas the world is looking to america\nfor energy leadership and stability as\ncurrent\nevents pose potential economic\ndisruptions when inflation already\naffects households both in the u.s\nacross europe\nif we remember gas was 1.69 to 1.89 16\nmonths ago\nand now you can fill up for about 449.\ndiesel is somewhere around 529. so all\nwe're doing is asking for us to be\nallowed to use the resources that we\nhave in georgia and the u.s of a and i\nchallenge each person here to at least\nthink about when you go home tonight you\nfeel your vehicles up\nmy truck goes 34.9 gallons my bass boat\nis 57 so guess what that's about 400\nwhen i go to fill up both of them i'd\nsure like to get back down to the\nnatural but thank you mr speaker i yield\nwell\nall right we have another member that\nwish to be heard\nand then we have a minority report the\nchair recognizes\nrepresentative beth moore\nto speak to the bill\ncolleagues i know that today's our last\nday in the house including my last day\nand so i expect that there will be\naccusations of politicking going on in\nthis well from both sides\nthere's probably some merit to that\nbut you know this this resolution came\nthrough the energy utilities and telecom\ncommittee and you know i've so enjoyed\nbeing a member of that committee because\nwe do really good work in that committee\nuh this year we focused on uh you know\non electric vehicle charging stations\nwe've done a lot of work with solar\nenergy\nthe future of energy in america is not\ndigging up dinosaur bones all right it\nis it's in the sun it's in the wind so\nfor us to get up here and say let's dig\nour heels more into oil and gas\nis not the look that we want to give the\npublic here in the georgia house\nso i rise in opposition to this house\nresolution you know if there was ever an\naccusation that the president has a\ndirect\nimpact on oil and gas i would say that\nperson is mistaken and i would say that\nno matter whose party held the\npresidency\nso i ask you to vote no on this and when\ni do that i'm also asking you to\nremember that this\nthis assertion that politics is causing\ngas prices to go up\nlet us remember\nthat the oil and gas companies are\nprivate\nfor profit companies\nthey set the gas prices so to say that\noh the president is causing gas prices\nto go up congress is causing it\ngeopolitical politics yeah maybe that\nhas something to do with it\nbut it is the ceos\nof oil and gas companies that set the\nprices so if we're going to urge the\npresident to do something about it i\nthought it might only be fair to ask the\nceos of the oil and gas companies to do\nit so while we're here let's call on\ndavid lawler chairman and president of\nbp america michael k worth chairman and\nceo of chevron richard moncrief\npresident ceo of devon energy daryn\nwoods ceo of exxon scott d sheffield ceo\nof pioneer natural resources and\ngretchen watkins president of shell usa\nthey are the ones taking advantage of a\ngeopolitical conflict to raise gas\nprices and then using the whole oh let's\nask the president to do something about\nit as a way to distract\nfrom the profiteering\nof oil and gas companies in a time of\ncrisis\nso we should urge them\nto stop\nraising gas prices at a time when\namericans\nneed a little bit of relief\nthank you\nthere also is a minority report on this\nmeasure\nis this your last time to speak in the\nhouse or am i just\nhoping that\n[Applause]\nyou know i had a member this morning uh\nrepresentative that wanted\nme to uh\nignore the fact that we don't have to do\nimmediate transmittals\nthis today to immediately transmit you\nto the state senate\nnot you\nthe chair recognizes representative\nmclaren for the minority report\nthank you mr speaker you know\nto to address the chairs question i\nthink\nall of us in here know that we do a lot\nbetter when we let the spirit move us to\nspeak than when we meticulously go home\nand write out speeches a day in advance\nso in that spirit mr speaker the house\nrules provide for a minority\nreport which was duly filed on this\nresolution in the eut committee and here\nwe are pursuant to the proper procedure\nand process delivering a minority report\nin opposition to this resolution which\nas you heard the members say is a\npolitical stunt in an election year but\nlet's talk about the substance of this\nresolution using\nthis minority report to elucidate\nwhy this resolution is being brought\n[Applause]\nand why it might miss the mark from a\nfactual standpoint\nif you look at line 19 of this\nresolution it says\nwhereas the biden administration\ncontinues to increase costs and delay\nefforts to develop oil and natural gas\nleasing on federal lands and waters\ndespite the fact that the program\nprovides billions of dollars in revenues\nto federal state and local governments\nand supports\nconservation programs throughout the\ncountry i almost hope that my opponent\nclips that to make it sound like i said\nit because that would be entertaining\nbut that is the rhetoric that has been\nput before the house today the rhetoric\nthat democrats in opposition committee\nmoved to amend out of the resolution to\nmake a bipartisan statement about the\ndifficulty that americans are facing\nwith gas prices but that amendment was\nrejected ladies and gentlemen why\nbecause we face an election year of\nhistoric proportions in this state where\nevery single thread of potential\npartisan conflict we must grasp onto in\norder to make our case to our base\nthat's going to turn out anyway because\nof how polarized the country is and they\ndon't need one oil and gas resolution to\ndo that but we're insistent\nbecause we say to our base don't worry\nwe've got your back not just on one bill\nbut two bills and five bills and ten\nbills and also this resolution and every\nissue that's ever polarized you\neverything that's ever graced tucker\ncarlson on fox news at nine o'clock when\nyou're tired and you don't know what to\nhate and so the tv tells you for you\nwhat you need to hate don't worry\nbecause we've got your back\nyou can hate president biden for his\nincreasing costs and delaying efforts\nwell unfortunately facts are a stubborn\nthing say some of our favorite\nconservative commentators and one of the\nfacts to consider in this case is that\njust days ago in fact probably minutes\nbefore the eut committee passed this\nresolution the biden administration\nbegan taking steps to release tens of\nmillions of barrels of oil in order to\ndecrease\noil and gas prices because as the member\naptly stated in speaking up in\nopposition to the bill\nwhat would you do if you were an oil\ncompany with a de facto cartel over a\nglobal supply\nand the price just happened to increase\nbecause of wartime conditions you might\nsay\ni don't know if i'm ready for these\nprices to drop just yet\nit may be that we want to enjoy an\nartificially restricted supply for the\nmoment\nso that we can make a couple bucks while\namericans are suffering\nand those same oil companies who you\nknow this resolution says that\nregulations are\nall poor exxon mobil is like trying to\nmake it through the day but they can't\nbecause these regulations are like the\nbrush that they're walking through\ndisorienting and stinging\nbut these regulations are not the\nproblem why because we all know\nanother fact\nthat these oil companies are sitting on\nmillions of least acres of federal land\nthat they aren't using\nthey're undeveloped\nthis is not that they have to develop\nnew land\nbecause they've already got it\nand again if you were an oil company\nwhat would you do would you rush to\nstart producing on your undeveloped\nlands that you're already leasing to\ntake down your prices\nrecord level profits that you're\nenjoying no\nwhat's much easier to do than that blame\nthe biden administration am i right\ni'm right\nnow with this minority report that is\ngranted under the rules of the house i\nwould like to take a quick detour a very\nshort detour mr speaker into a more\nthematic approach to opposition to this\nresolution\nwhich is to talk about partisanship and\nthe usefulness of partisan messaging by\na show of hands nobody's going to raise\ntheir hand but i'm going to use this\ndevice\nhow many people in here have heard their\nvoters say republican or democrat\nwe're tired of the bickering right\nwe're tired of opposition for the sake\nof opposition\nthat's just meant to inflame partisan\ntensions my voters have said that even\nmy most dedicated liberal voters in the\nbase\nwho\nwant me to vote\nleft on all the stuff we do there those\nsame people say to me\ni just wish that it weren't so vitriolic\ni wish that we weren't constantly\nsniffing at each other for nothing\nnow let me admit something to you\nwhen i first ran for the state house in\n2018\ni ran because of donald\ntrump\ni went to my primary care physician i\nsaid doc\nthere's something wrong and i don't know\nwhat it is and they put a stethoscope on\nmy chest and they used a little thing to\nlook in my ear\nthey said say ah\nand i was in there for about 20 minutes\nand the nurse came back and she said we\nhave some bad news\nit appears you have trump derangement\nsyndrome\nthat was a hard day\nthat was a hard day because you know i\nthought maybe it's just me you know\nbut no it was something that a lot of us\ncame down with\nand so you know actually little known\nfact every member of the d17\nwho\ngot elected in 2018 the democratic\nincoming class we were all\nsimultaneously gardening\nuh\nwhen we found out trump got elected we\nwere all like different parts of the\ngarden\nand when we found out\nis it like two in the morning right when\nthe results were called\nwe all looked up in this very dramatic\nway towards the sky\nwe dropped our garden implements in slow\nmotion\nand each of us from the corners of the\nstate started walking to the state\ncapitol\nall at once\nnow the reason we did it is because we\nwere trump deranged\nit was very partisan we were explicitly\nlike this country's going down the tank\nthis this one guy right this one guy is\nthe problem\ni am going to make a point madam chair i\npromise\nthis one guy is the problem\nand\nwe got here and you guys remember i'm\ntalking to people in my class do you\nremember when we got here and we\nrealized how much more there was\nto state legislative service\nto caring about the public caring about\nvoters and more importantly and i've\nspoken to this from the well\nrelationships\nwithin this body that matter a lot to us\nwe learned a great deal about how\ncomplex representation is\nand how important it is to come together\nto put the small stuff away because\nultimately that's what it's about it's\nputting the small stuff away and\nrecognizing that a lot of what we do\nhere is bipartisan\ni have changed a lot as a person since\nwe got elected in 2018. i have grown to\nappreciate perspectives that i would not\nhave appreciated when i came in when the\nwhole reason for coming in was like\nnational politics whatever\ni've grown i've changed and i've\nrecognized that i like being here for\nreasons that have nothing to do\nwith the headlines on cnn and msnbc\nso\nin a very serious way\nthe last thing i'll say is\nthis resolution\nyou know\nis not in that spirit\nthis resolution is just a quick bite\nfor an election year and\nlook maybe we'll do this too right i\nmean this is the argument you can always\nmake so if you guys are in the majority\nyou do the same thing maybe we will do\nthis maybe we'll hit a future republican\npresident and maybe that'll be\nappropriate when it happens i don't know\nmaybe it'll be good maybe it'll be bad\num\nbut we all know what this is and at the\nend of the day whether you think climate\nchange is real or not whether you have\narguments about energy or not that you\nthink are you know reasonable people can\ndisagree about\nwe're only going to win long term like\nwe're only going to make it out of this\nfunk we're in\nif we think long and hard about whether\nwe want to do this and whether it's\nworth it\nand you may make the judgment today that\nit's worth it but in general\nremember this is playing with fire\nremember that the base voters are going\nto respond to the signals we give them\nand if we want a happy\nstate that lives in community with each\nother\nwe got to make sure when we take our\nshots we really want to take them okay\ni appreciate your time thanks for my\nshenanigan for tolerating my shenanigans\nlove you guys mr speaker yield well\nwhat purpose does representative ridley\nrise\nparliamentary inquiry inquiry\nmr speaker is it not true that my friend\nin the well does put on a great show\nbut from the

mr speaker that what this is all\nabout actually\nuh is not attacking the president or\nanything like that but it's about urging\nthe president to take certain actions\nthat he can take\nto either do things or undo things that\nhe's done\nthat will\nallow for more drilling\nallow for more exploration without\npenalties which he has proposed he's\nactually proposed just this past week\npenalties on drilling further penalties\nfor drilling on government lands isn't\nit true that's what this is about is\nhelping the american people people here\nin georgia to pay a more reasonable\nprice for the gasoline is that not true\ni\nit appears to me to be the language uh\nworded that way\nit would also strike the chair that\nsomehow i don't think that they're\nholding their breath in washington\nwaiting on this to get up there\num\nany more than they did in the prior\nadministration hold their breath for\nthings like this\nto get up there but they are interesting\nand\ngive us a
