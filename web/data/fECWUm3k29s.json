And it's my honor\ntoday to uh to introduce the Reverend\nChris Humphre. He is the senior pastor\nat Bainbridge First Baptist Church in\nDecar County. And he's been the pastor\nthere since uh 2019. He's spent over 20\nyears in the ministry uh serving uh at\nCalvary Baptist Church in Oel, Georgia\nfrom 2006 to 2018 and Pinerove Baptist\nin Gillsville, Georgia from 2002 to\n2006. Uh, Pastor Humphrey's accepted\nChrist on March the 10th and answered\nthe call to the ministry in 1999.\nHe is a graduate of Columbus State uh,\nUniversity where he received a bachelor\nof arts and history degree and a master\nof arts and religion from Liberty\nUniversity. uh his ministry objective\nhas been to fulfill the great commission\nand to make sure his church is engaged\nuh locally uh fulfilling uh God's\nmission locally, nationally, and around\nthe world. And uh I can honestly say\nI've listened to some of your ser\nsermons, pastor, and I can I can hear\nthat in your voice. So I know you are\nyou are holding true to that. So thank\nyou. Uh he's obviously an avid Bulldog\nfan, loves golf, loves pickle ball. Uh\nbut he couldn't do anything without the\nsupport of his wife Kimberly and their\ntwo children, Luke and Hope. And of\ncourse, I met Pastor Humphrey's uh this\npast summer at one of the Georgia\nBaptist public affairs training events\ndown in uh in Bainbridge in Decar\nCounty. And so uh it was great to be\ndown there and share with them. But what\nreally put him on my heart is uh so many\nof my constituents that he has to\nminister to down there in Decar County.\nAnd uh have a lot of good friends down\nthere. He actually brought one of them\nup with him. Darren Deal is over here\njoining him for the drive, the 4-hour\ndrive up to keep him keep him company.\nSo, it's just an honor to have him here.\nAnd um uh Reverend Humphre, I'll turn it\nover to you. Thank you.\nThank you, sir.\n>> Well, good morning. Thank you so much uh\nfor having me today, Senator Walker, and\ndistinguished members of the Senate here\nin Atlanta. We're so grateful for you\nand your work. Uh, Senator Watson, thank\nyou so much for the opportunity uh to\nstand before you. It's an honor today uh\nfor me to be here and I'm certainly\ngrateful to stand before you today. It's\nvery important that I let you know that\nI am from uh Bainbridge, Georgia. Even\nthough I grew up in Atlanta, I live in\nBainbridge. Bainbridge matters in\nAtlanta. And so, I just want to make\nsure you guys know that. For all of my\nfriends in Bainbridge, they're very glad\nthat I just said that. And so thank you\nso much uh for us uh and for what you\nguys do up here. Now I know you have a\nlot of work to do today and I just\nsimply want to offer a moment of\ngrounding for you because in this\nchamber the pace is fast, the decisions\nare heavy and the stakes are real for\nthe people that you serve. And I'm\nreminded of something uniquely Georgian.\nGrowing up in Atlanta, when you're\nhiking up Stone Mountain with a\nparticular group, you quickly learn that\nthe goal isn't just reaching the top,\nbut it's staying together on the way up.\nSo, if one person, for example, sprints\nahead, they miss the conversation. And\nif someone lags behind, they miss the\nencouragement. So, the real value is\nfound in walking together step by step.\nThis image echoes but powerful line from\nscripture. In Micah chapter 6:8, we're\nencouraged. What does the Lord require\nof you? But to do justice, to love\nmercy, and to walk humbly with your God.\nYou see, justice shapes our decisions.\nMercy shapes our hearts. But humility\nshapes our pace, how we walk with God,\nand how we walk with one another. And if\nthere's any place where pace matters,\nit's right here. you know, because of\nthe work that you do. It isn't just\nabout policy. It is about people. It's\nabout neighbors. It's about families.\nIt's about communities and futures. And\nwalking humbly together keeps us mindful\nof those people. So, as we begin today,\nI invite you to take a breath, you know,\nto steady your pace to remember the one\nwho walks with you and the people who\nwalk behind each and every boat that you\ncast. The Bible emphasizes that those\nwho live in fellowship with a holy God\nand his people must live in a way which\nreflects his holiness. He mentioned in\nthis passage, we love mercy. Mercy is a\nrich word which includes the idea of\nfaithful love and action. Since I'm from\na farmer's town, there was a farmer who\nonce discovered that there was a group\nof neighborhood kids who trampled part\nof his garden while cutting through his\nproperty. rows of young plants were\ncrushed. He was frustrated because he\ndepended on that garden. The next day,\nhe saw the same kids walking by. But\ninstead of scolding them, he walked out\nwith a basket of fresh vegetables and\nsimply said, \"Looks like y'all took a\nshortcut yesterday.\" So, I figured if\nyou're going to pass through my garden,\nyou might as well taste what's growing\nhere. The kids were stunned. There was\nno lecture, no anger, just unexpected\nkindness. Over the next weeks, the same\nkids began stopping by to help him weed,\nwater, and plant. The shortcut became a\nplace of relationship. The garden grew,\nand so did their hearts. What does mercy\ntell us? It doesn't ignore wrong. Mercy\ntransforms wrong by responding with a\ngoodness the other people didn't earn.\nIn Micah 6:8, it says to love mercy, not\nto tolerate mercy, not occasionally show\nmercy, but we should love it. We should\ndelight in it because it reflects the\nheart of God toward us. Why does it\nmatter? Well, it breaks circles of\nretaliation. We open doors for healing.\nWe create space for God to work in ways\njustice alone never could. And we remind\npeople of the mercy we ourselves live on\neach and every day. So walking with God\nstresses that man must remember that he\nis man and that God is God. The proud\nman will find God will resist him. There\nwas a pastor once who told his\ncongregation that he had finally\nmastered humility. He even announced,\n\"I've written a book about it. Humility\nand how I have achieved it.\" The next\nday, one of the deacons pulled him aside\nand said, \"Pastor, you might want to\nrethink that title.\" The pastor grand\nand replied, \"Well, I was going to call\nit walking humbly with God, but the\npublisher said that it didn't sound\nnearly as impressive.\"\nAnd the deacon responded and said,\n\"Exactly. That's the point. Public\nservice is a calling that makes much of\nus uh think with our heart. Every\ndecision you make affects the lives that\nyou may never meet. And the weight of\nthe responsibility can be heavy.\" And\nMicah suggests in these grounding words,\nGod does not ask for perfection. He asks\nfor orientation that our work be rooted\nin justice shaped by mercy and carried\nout with humility. Justice keeps us\ncommitted to fairness even when it's\ncostly. Mercy softens our heart toward\nthose who struggle or disagree with us.\nHumility reminds us that leadership is\nnot about elevating ourselves, but\nelevating the common good. So when these\nthree virtues guide our steps, our work\nmore than policy, it becomes service\nthat honors God and blesses people.\nPlease know that we pray for you and we\nhope the absolute best for you as you\ndiscern and make decisions for our\nstate. Let's go to the Lord in prayer\nfor Father, we grant our legislators\nwisdom that is steady, compassion that\nis deep, and humility that is sincere.\nstrengthen them to lead with integrity\nand listen with patience and to act with\ncourage. May their work bring peace,\njustice, and hope to the people they\nserve. Amen. God bless you guys.\n>> It's an excellent message. Thank you.\nAll right. And it's time for the\nintroduce the doctor of the day. And I\nwill call on the senator from the 52nd\nto introduce our doctor of the day.\nChairman, how you\n>> how you doing? Good. Good.\n>> Yeah, good to see you. Nice to see you.\n>> Thank you, Mr. President. I have uh one\nof our internal medicine family\nphysicians from Rome here. And um I\nshould add that my own family physician\nof the last 38 years retired December\n31st, so I may be calling on him here in\nthe near future. But Dr. John Pitman is\noriginally from Commerce, Georgia, went\nto Presbyterian College in South\nCarolina, then to Mercer, and then did\nhis residency at Emory University and\nworked in South Carolina for a while, I\nbelieve North Side Hospital, but since\n2007, we've gotten him over to Rome,\nGeorgia, and have kept him over there um\nand working hard in our community.\nUm and he has been part of uh the\nfaculty with u the residency program\nthere at uh Redmond Advent Hospital as\nwell as the Philadelphia College of\nMedicine as well and and numerous other\nappointments he's been on that are that\nhave too many to number. But anyway,\nwe're glad to have him here as a doctor\ntoday. Um I've had some others that have\nbeen here that have had some exciting\nthings happen. uh some of them right\noutside the Senate floor, but maybe\nwe'll keep it calm today hopefully.\nAnyway, thank you for being here and say\na couple of words to the Senate.\n>> Sure will.\n>> Uh thank you very much for that uh\nintroduction. It's very kind and thank\nyou for letting me serve you today as\nthe doctor of the day. It's quite the\nhonor and thank you for your service uh\nthe fine work that you'll do today and\nin the upcoming part of this legislative\nsession. So, thank you very much for\nthat. And thank you very much uh for\nyour attention to the health care of our\nfine Georgia citizens. It has not gone\nunnoticed and is very much appreciated.\nHave a great day.\nWe have with us today some special\nguests. The secretary will read a\nresolution.\nSenate resolution 596 recognizing Big\nBrothers Big Sisters agencies across\nGeorgia and commending their work in\nsupporting students and families across\nthe state of Georgia and for other\npurposes. Whereas Big Brothers, Big\nSisters agencies across Georgia are\ndedicated to helping young people\nrealize their full potential through\npositive, sustained mentor relationships\nthat support academic success,\nstrengthen families, and build safer,\nmore connected communities. And\nwhereas the Big Brothers, Big Brothers,\nBig Sisters agencies, school-based, and\ncommunity based programs have produced\nmeasurable improvements in student\nattendance, academic performance, and\nsense of belonging. Now therefore, be it\nresolved by the Senate that the members\nof this body recognize Big Brothers, Big\nSisters agencies across Georgia for\ntheir leadership in supporting youth,\nfamilies, and schools across the state.\nCommend the Level Up program for its\nproven impact in reducing chronic\nabsenteeism and strengthening student\nsuccess in Georgia schools. Acknowledge\nthe essential role of mentorship in\npromoting academic achievement, family\nstability, and long-term community\nwell-being. and support the continued\nexpansion of this mentorshipbased\nprogram that increases attendance,\nimproves engagement, and builds brighter\nfutures for children across the state of\nGeorgia. Mr. President, that completes\nthe order.\nIs there objection to the adoption of\nthe resolution?\nChair hears none and the resolution is\nadopted.\nI'd like to call upon the senator from\nthe 36 to introduce our special guest.\n>> Thank you, Mr. President. Colleagues, I\nam so happy to bring to you today uh\nfolks who are doing the great work with\nbig brothers, big sisters uh and to pass\nthis resolution that commends them. Uh\nwe have with us today uh folks who are\nvery dedicated to this program and you\nknow this is a mentorship program and\nthe mentors\nbenefit richly as do the mentees and I I\nI've heard the other day the head of the\nnational uh big brothers big sisters who\nwas being interviewed uh on uh a\nnational program and he pointed out that\nsometimes the the mentors want to meet\neven more often than the mentees are\nable to handle that. It's that it's that\nkind of program. It's a life-changing\nprogram uh for young people and equally\nuh enriches the lives of those who\nmentor them. Uh and here in Georgia, we\nhave a a uh uh Big Brothers Big Sisters\nagencies all across the state. And with\nus today are Big Brothers, Big Sisters\nof Metro Atlanta uh who've come to be\nrecognized and to uh share a minute with\nyou about their work. And I know there\nare many of us uh here uh in the chamber\nin the Senate here in Georgia as well as\nover in the House that have had personal\nexperience with Big Brothers Big\nSisters. I'm happy to uh\nrecognize and introduce and bring to the\nuh podium uhwami Johnson senior who is\nthe CEO of Big Brothers Big Sisters of\nMetro Atlanta and he is joined as well\nhere on uh on the uh roster by Pierre\nGaither who is the chief operating\nofficer of Big Brothers Big Sisters of\nMetro Atlanta with deep roots in a\ncommunity that I represent here in town.\nBetsy Fitzgerald, CEO of Big Brothers\nBig Sisters of the Heart of Mon, uh is\nwith us today and Lindseay Foster, the\nexecutive director of Big Brothers Big\nSisters of Northwest Georgia Mountains.\nUh so they uh they they cover the state\nlike the de uh that falls. I I am uh\npleased and proud to lift up the work uh\nof this uh great organization here\nacross our state and uh invite uhwami\nJohnson senior the CEO to address us.\nThank you.\n>> Well, thank you, Senator, and thank you\nall for your your service and your\nsupport. Uh as you all know, we have a\nteam of folks here with Big Brothers and\nBig Sisters. We have our representatives\nhere across the state who were just\nintroduced, but also our team who's up\nin the gallery here and also our littles\nwho are serving as pages today. So,\nthey'll be supporting you all all day\nlong. And this is an amazing\nlife-changing experience for them. We\nsay that we are defenders of potential.\nNone of us got here without somebody\ndefending our potential. Collectively,\nwe serve close to 4,000 youth across 30\ncounties here in Georgia. We're making a\nhuge impact. We know that 98% of our\nyoung people graduate high school on\ntime. 99% avoid the criminal justice\nsystem and 83% feel much more connected\nto school. You know us for our onetoone\nmodel, but we've been very innovative in\nlaunching new programs and one is level\nup where we actually have paid mentors\nworking in school buildings every day.\nWe are embedding mentorship in public\neducation. This is a middle school\nmodel. Our schools have the top\nattendance. Chronic absenteeism is a big\nissue in Georgia. We are combating that.\nWe're keeping kids in school.\nSuspensions are down and kids are\nthriving through mentorship in our\nprogram. As the senator mentioned, both\nsides benefit from mentorship, the\nlittle and the big. And it also brings\npeople together from different worlds.\nAnd we need that more and more in the\nday and age that we live in. Bringing\ndifferent people together to support and\nlearn from each other. So, we appreciate\nyour support. We want to expand our\nprograms across the state. Our programs\nwork in urban, suburban, and rural and\nwe have impact. So, we'd love to partner\nwith you all and we appreciate your\nsupport in doing that.\n>> I'd like to present the resolution to\nyou on behalf of the Georgia Senate uh\nQuaame and again applaud the work. All\nof us know somebody whose lives are\ntouched by this. Uh we appreciate uh the\ninvaluable contribution that this uh\nnonprofit makes here across our state.\nThank you.\n>> Thank you. Thank you.\nWe'll get our picture down there, I\nguess.\nAre there any unanimous consents?\nDoes any senator wish to rise on a point\nof personal privilege?\nI recognize a senator from the 39th\nThank you, Mr. President.\nToday, more than 1,400 Georgians are\nhere at the Capitol for Addiction\nRecovery Awareness Day 2026. They have\ncome from just down the street, less\nthan a mile from the gold dome, and from\nmore than five hours away just to be\npresent. These people are Georgia. They\nrepresent the more than 900,000\nGeorgians living in recovery, mothers\nand fathers, sons and daughters,\nco-workers, neighbors, and friends. And\nthey also stand for the more than 1.4 4\nmillion Georgians currently living with\nactive addiction in every community in\nevery district throughout our entire\nstate. There is no family, no workplace,\nno school, college, university or house\nof worship, not a single community that\nhas been spared the addiction epidemic.\nAs a co-chair of the general assembly's\nworking group on addiction and recovery\nalong with the senator from Columbus, I\nhave had the privilege of sitting with\nproviders, peer counselors, and people\nliving in recovery. And what I can tell\nyou is this. In Georgia, recovery is\nreal. It's real in the stories walking\nthese halls today. It's real in the\nlives being rebuilt. It's real in the\nfamilies being restored. And I want to\nthank every member of this chamber,\nespecially those who are part of the\nbipartisan working group for continuing\nto pass legislation that saves lives and\nstrengthens communities. And when you\nsee our friend Jeff Breedlove today,\nknow that he is here with more than\n1,000 of our constituents. So if you\ncan, please take a moment to say hello\nbecause the person you meet today is not\na headline or a statistic. They are a\nsurvivor of the disease that is killing\nmore Georgians between the ages of 18\nand 45 than anything else. And today\nthey are standing here visible,\ncourageous, and hopeful, reminding us\nthat in Georgia recovery is indeed real.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nChair recognizes the senator from the\n16th\nfor a point of personal privilege.\nThank you, Mr. President. I appreciate\nit. And I wanted to speak to you on SB\n424 that was uh dropped yesterday. The\nfour is for Georgians. The 24 is for car\ngold. And you can say what's gold about?\nWhat does that have to do with it?\nInteresting. If you will, let me kind of\ngive you just an overview to think\nabout. Uh our gold dome has 80 more than\n80 ounces of gold on top of the roof.\nThat most of that came from Delana,\nGeorgia. You may not know that.\nInteresting that gold is a tier one\nasset for banks and currently gold\nselling is is at $5,200 an ounce or more\nright now. But how can the average\nGeorgian buy gold or can they buy gold?\nWell, they can. And that's through\ntransactional gold. And I want to talk\nabout that just a second and make you\naware that transactional gold is the\nability to own gold on a fractional\nbasis. That means you can take a coin\nsuch as a gold coin and you can take\nyour debit card and go to your gold\naccount and transfer value and buy\nthings at Chick-fil-A, wherever you want\nto buy your um uh food or wherever you\nwould like to simply by having a\nfraction. You can own it. You can put\n$100 in. You could put $5,000 in, but\nyou don't have to buy the whole thing.\nWell, how does this idea come? If you\nlook at it constitutionally, article\none, section 10 of the US Constitution\nsays states cannot create currency, but\nthey can have gold and silver\ndepositories in which their citizens can\nplace their gold or silver and the state\nhas oversight. Already Texas has its a\ndepository and five other states already\nhave gold and s transactional goal in\nplace. Florida this year signed over and\nthey now have transactional gold that\ntheir people are going to be able to own\ngold as a hedge against inflation and\nwhat's going on with our debt.\nCurrently, we have $37 trillion in debt\nand we are seeing this. We are seeing\ninflation at a way we've never seen it\nbefore. But making it practical is\nhaving the ability to own it for\nGeorgians overseen by the state of\nGeorgia but have transactional\ncapability to be able to use that gold\nin small amounts if I want to. Right now\nif someone owns gold where do they put\nit? Well in this way we would have it in\na depository supervised by the state of\nGeorgia by the treasur and then you\nwould have access to your goal through a\ntransactional side with a a card. I\nbelieve this that we need to have\nopportunities. And I think if you look\nat this on the hat, it says another way\nto pay. You know what? You can go in and\nyou can pay with your master card, your\nVisa or whatever you would like to, but\nyou could have a debit card to your gold\naccount or silver account and transfer\nmoney that way as well. I believe this\nit's economic freedom for Georgians and\nit is a way that you can pay and own\nsomething that you could not own\nnormally but you could own it in small\ndenominations using a technology called\nGlint which is already out and is\nrunning right now. I just think this I\nask you to read if you will a little bit\nabout what's going on and I believe this\ngold is a hedge against inflation that\nevery Georgian should have available to\nthem not just limited to those who are\nwealthy and I thank you very much Mr.\nPresident\n>> chair recognized senator from the 43rd\nfor a point of personal privilege\nThank you, Mr. President. Good morning,\ncolleagues. I rise today\nto\nsay happy 70th platinum wedding\nanniversary to my parents.\n>> I know.\nYeah. Go ahead.

So happy\nanniversary mom and dad. 70 years\nstrong. Thank you.\n>> Chair recognizes a senator from the\n28th. Senator, would you like to speak\nfrom your desk or you want to come to\nthe well?\n>> Okay.\nThank you.\n>> Okay. Thank you.\nUh oh.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nAnd excuse me for being so slow, but I'm\nwalking. Just in slow motion, but not on\npurpose.\nI rise to discuss\nthe weekend's events in Minnesota.\nWe all watched\nas a 37year-old\nveteran nurse, VA nurse was murdered in\ncold blood.\nAnd we all watched\nas the majority defended him that\nmurdered because Donald Trump said they\nshould.\nThis morning I want to discuss how the\nmajority has defended gun rights for 30s\nplus years and suddenly they do not care\nwhen Trump says that they shouldn't\ncare.\nOur rights are bigger than a president\nrights are bigger than the majority's\nagenda.\nSR 605 asks us to commit to uh\nprotecting those rights. The majority\nfinds this so controversial, but the\nidea that we should commit to protecting\nrights\nthat they sent it to a committee.\nPlease let me know when we can protect\nour rights.\nPass SR605\nnow. And you know, I've always stood for\nsaving lives and for justice. So, I\nbrought this to you this morning. But\nthis afternoon, we'll still be trying to\nsave lives because we will have um a\nforum because people are here from all\nover the state for saving lives and for\ntalking about um our autistic uh young\npeople and also about chase uh chasing\nthe police, chasing in neighborhoods and\npeople dying as a result. So, thank you\nfor listening,\nMr. Chairman. I yield the will. Thank\nyou.\nSenators yielded the well.\nLots of points of personal privilege\ntoday. Um,\nI now call on the senator from the 15th,\nthe dean of the Senate\nfor a point of personal privilege.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nGood morning, colleagues.\nAs dean of the Senate, I've been had the\nhonor of being called. I certainly\nappreciate that. a member of the\nVeterans Hall of Fame. I come to the\npodium this morning to express some\ntrouble observation that we witness\nin our chamber in our country. I've\nstood in the chamber for years defending\nall rights. I fought to defend them\nwhile serving in our armed forces. And\ntoday I along with a lot of others mourn\nthe ease with which we set aside those\nrights when it suits our political\nconvenience, especially when it benefits\nour President Donald Trump. Across our\nnation, we've seen a moment of profound\nshock and controversy in Minneapolis,\nMinnesota, where Alex Prey, a 37year-old\nICU nurse and US citizen, was shot and\nkilled by federal agents during an\nimmigration enforcement operation.\nThis tragedy has ignited widespread\ndebate with bystanders footage and\nreporting raising serious questions\nabout how federal force was used. Viral\nvideos appears to contradict official\nnar narratives and show Prey attempting\nto help others not engaging in violence\nwhen the shooting occurred.\nWhether one agreed with his views or\nnot, Freddy was not chaos incarnate. He\nwas a citizen who voiced his opinion\nlegally carried a firearm under state\nlaw and whose death has sparked calls\nfor investigation and accountability\nfrom leaders across the political\nspectrum. We may disagree on the full\nreach of the Second Amendment, but we do\nnot disagree that every American has a\nright to self-defense, to protest, and\nto feel secure under our Constitution.\nHere in Georgia, let us not wait for the\ntragedy like the one that happened.\nLet's not see that happen in our streets\nbefore we choose to act. I urge all of\nour colleagues on both sides of the\naisle, friends with whom I worked with\nfor years, to join me in protecting our\nrights, not sidelining them when it's\ninconvenient.\nWe should pass State Resolution 605 by\nunanimous consent.\nLet us reaffirm our commitment to our\ncivil liberties and to the very freedoms\nthat make this nation worth defending.\nThis is America.\nI yield the well, Mr. President. Thank\nyou.\nChair recognizes the senator from the\n26.\nThank you, Mr. President. Ladies and\ngentlemen of the h of the senate\nand thought about 37 years ago.\nYou know when I grew up in Mon Georgia,\nI was born in a town called Tumisville\nin Byron, Georgia.\nAnd on the weekend, I always wanted to\ngo back to the country so I could hunt\nwith my cousin.\nI never will forget\nbeing 13 years old and he gave me a JC\nHiggins double barrel 410\nand I used to go shoot the squirrels out\nthe pecan trees and get a dollar for the\nsquing\nschool. Every payday I used to go to\nRosses\nand buy a gun.\nI bought a SKS for $49 in the box with\nthe bayonet and everything in it.\nAnd when I had a fire at my house and\nwhen the fireman got there, I said, \"You\nneed to get to the basement cuz if you\ndon't, it's going to be like the 4th of\nJuly.\"\nBut as I\ngo home and watch television\nand I see\npeople\ngetting killed,\nyou said he had a gun, but you took the\ngun\nand then you shot him and he was face\ndown.\nNow, yes, I'm a Democrat\nand the majority of you in here are\nRepublicans,\nbut at some point in time, when do we do\nwhat we need to do?\nDonald Trump gets in his pants the same\nway I do. One leg at a time.\nHe told you when he got reelected he was\ngoing to be like a dictator.\nNo wonder he likes Putin\nbecause Putin kills all of his\nopposition.\nAnd it seems as though this president\nthat we have\nis doing a whole lot.\nHe's a president that's making plenty of\nmoney.\nCryptocoin,\nPrince of Saudi puts $2 billion in it.\nHe's making more money than you can\nshake a stick at.\nBut we in here.\nAnd many of us, those of you who are\nold,\nknow back know what happened back in the\nday.\nI don't plan\nto fight the Civil War all over again.\nHistory tells us where we've been.\nBut I'm saying to all of you,\nwe don't need a federal detention center\nin Georgia.\nPeople are being stopped\nbecause they don't speak English\nor they look different.\nSkin color\nis part of the problem.\nNow I've seen and watched on television\nand you telling me I didn't see what I\nsaw.\nThe lady that got killed\nwasn't trying to run over\nthe officer.\nWhen you look at it, she was turning the\ncar to the right. The officer ran up and\nshot in the head.\nAnd you trying to say it's all right?\nA nurse\nwho had a pistol toten permit.\nGun taken.\nHe's scuffling with ICE officers.\nHe's put on his stomach\nand the next thing you know, you hear\nsix shots\nand he's dead.\nSomething is wrong.\nYou the majority,\nbut sometime you have to stand up for\nwhat's right.\nAs I said, many of you who are of the\nage that I am\nknow what we went through in the south.\nBut it's time that we stand up\nfor human rights\nand stand up for what's right.\nI yield the way.\nSenators yielded the well. I recognize\nthe senator from the 55th for a point of\npersonal privilege.\nSenate rules allow five minutes, but you\ndon't have to use all five minutes.\nLadies and gentlemen of this\ndistinguished body, I rise to\nspeak to recent events.\nOn January 24th, heavily armed federal\nimmigration agents deployed by the\ncurrent president\nruthlessly\nmurdered an American citizen less than\ntwo miles\nfrom his home.\nAlex Prey was a 37year-old nurse caring\nfor American veterans at the VA hospital\nin Minnesota Minneapolis.\nHe was a lawful gun owner peacefully\nattending a public protest.\nThis is the man that the current\nadministration is calling a terrorist.\nAt the time of his murder,\nAlex was shielding a woman.\nThe administration said he was a danger\nto law enforcement.\nAt the time of his murder,\nAlex was legally carrying his firearm.\nThe current administration has said\npossessing a firearm justifies border\npatrol agents murdering\nhim.\nAt the time of his murder, Alex was\nvoicing his displeasure to violent\noverreach he believed his government was\nengaged in\nlike so many Americans before him have.\nEven the National Rifle Association\nspoke loudly this weekend,\nsaying that current administration\nofficials had to stop calling the\nvictims a terrorist simply because he\nlawfully possessed a firearm.\nFor years, we heard that the good guy\nwith a gun stops the bad guy with a gun.\nWe can't have it both ways, my\ncolleagues.\nSimply\nprotesting\npeacefully\ncannot evolve to a situation where\nviolence\nis the rain of the day.\nWhy? Because democracy\nis the resolution of our differences in\na nonviolent fashion.\nThe first amendment is so important\nfor this reason. It is the alternative\nto the bullet. It is alternative to\ncountries where they are violently\noverthrowing the government because\nthere are people that don't have a voice\nthat is being heard.\nDemocracy is so important because of the\nright to vote, the right to peacefully\nprotest. Why? Because violence is the\nlanguage of the unheard.\nIf people cannot safely voice a\ndifferent opinion\nthrough peaceful protests\nor the vote, violence is the only\nalternative. And we cannot give up this\ngreat country. A country built on the\nright. The first amendment is the right\nto peacefully protest.\nAnd the second amendment protects the\nfirst amendment.\nBut we have turned it upside down. We\ncannot have it both ways. And I\nchallenge my colleagues\nbecause it makes no sense that we are\nnot passing a unanimous\nSenate Resolution 605.\nIt makes no sense that we don't stand up\nand we must change that whole narrative.\nWe must learn to live together as a as\nor die and perish as fools. That is the\nreal crux of this matter and I stand\nbecause we cannot allow injustice\nanywhere to flourish unspoken and\nunchallenged and that is the right to\npeacefully protest.\nFirst they came for the socialists and I\ndid not speak up because I was not a\nsocialist. Then they came for the trade\nunion unionists and I did not speak out\nbecause I was not a trade unionist. Then\nthey came for the Jews and I did not\nspeak out because I was not a Jew. Then\nthey came for me and there was no one\nleft to speak for me. I challenge you my\ncolleagues. We must speak up for the\nleast, the lost and the left out. This\nis America. This is the United States of\nAmerica. It is not the divided states of\nAmerica. Thank you very kindly. Thank\nyou very kindly. Thank you very kindly.\nchair recognizes senator from the 11th\n>> for a point of personal privilege.\nYou Mr. President, I just need the uh\nrecord to show once again that I love my\nwife. I need to wish her happy 20th\nanniversary. Uh yes, thank y'all. and\nand I want to uh publicly promise to her\nno more transmissions for her car, no\nmore uh working cows on the weekends,\nand and no more holding that pin uh for\nthe excavator while I'm working on it\neither. So, uh the next 20 ought to be\nbetter than these past 20. So, I love\nyou. Thank you for what you do for our\nfamily and our farm. And we'll see you\nthis weekend.\n>> Thank you.\n>> Thank you, Senator.\nUh clearly Emily must be a saint and we\ngreatly appreciate her sharing you with\nus. So thank you very much. All right\nand now I recognize the senator from the\nsix, our lustrious rules chair.\nIt has become tradition here in the\nGeorgia State Senate that when the\nsenator from the 11th comes and wishes\nhis wife happy anniversary\nthat it's a good reminder for me to\nsame. So Megan love you. I'm not making\nany promises like the senator from the\n11th did although the cattle thing is\nprobably safe. Uh but happy anniversary.\nWe're 19th so always right behind you.\n>> God bless you Megan.\nUh now recognize the senator from the\nninth for a point of personal privilege.\nThank you, Mr. President. Now, we're\nback to the other programming today. So,\nI rise today on a personal point of\nprivilege to\nredirect us back to the tragedies of\nthis weekend and the tragedies that have\nbeen happening in Minnesota.\nOn my way to the Capitol this morning, I\nsaw some signs just before you hit I20.\nI don't know if y'all saw these folks.\nThey had signs up that read, \"Resist.\nCall your legislators.\"\nAnd now people are active.\nSo, let me be clear about this. All the\nTrump administration is accomp\naccomplishing right now is mobilizing\nvoters. People are waking up to the\nerosion of our democracy. People are\nwaking up to the fact that the Trump\nadministration and Republicans have\nmanufactured a crisis by demonizing\nimmigrants to distract from the real\nproblems that the Republican party has\nfailed to solve.\nPeople can't afford housing. Health care\ncosts are rising. Families are feeling\nthe pinch every time they go and get\ngroceries. And instead of dress\naddressing any of that, the Trump\nadministration has created a crisis,\nhired government-paid thugs, all under\nthe facade of immigration enforcement.\nRepublicans seem perfectly fine with\nunchecked ICE enforcement.\nRepublicans seem fine with Americans\nfeeling fear.\nRepublicans want chaos.\nRepublicans seem to be okay with\nterrorizing our citizens.\nWe're seeing this in Minnesota. And I\nwant Georgians to understand, don't\nthink this can't happen in Georgia. ICS\nis right here in Georgia. And yet many\nRepublicans remain silent\nabout holding ICE accountable.\nWhat's especially troubling is\nsome of my Republican colleagues are\nrunning for higher office. Governor,\nLieutenant Governor, attorney general.\nYet, not one has spoken out\nabout what is happening with ICE,\nISIS's unaccountability.\nNo one's speaking out about the outrage\nof what is happening in Minnesota and\nwhat could possibly happen here in\nGeorgia.\nAnd let me remind this chamber of\nsomething simple. Every single one of us\ncame from somewhere.\nWhether by choice or by for or by force.\nIf anyone needs a reminder of where you\ncame from, go check your ancestry.\nWe all came here from somewhere.\nAnd we used to be a nation that welcomed\nall.\nThe Republican party has become the\nparty that excuses violence against US\ncitizens on US soil. What happened in\nMinnesota was not caused by an\nimmigrant.\nIt was violence\ncommitted by a US citizen\nor US citizens against another US\ncitizen. And that's the truth.\nAnd we need to acknowledge\nthat is wrong.\nNow, Republicans refuse to commit to\nprotecting our First Amendment rights.\nsomehow defending the right to protest\nhas become too controversial for them.\nTrump himself has suggested that\nlawfully possessing a firearm justified\nthe death\nof Alex Prey.\nLet that sink in.\nNow, Republicans are refusing to commit\nuh commit to protecting our First\nAmendments, right? To make an excuse for\nDonald Trump in his administration.\nWe're in a state with polit permitless\ncarry.\nAnd we're in a state where in the past,\nRepublicans in this body have always\ndefended that.\nand the NRA.\nYou can't defend gun rights on one hand\nand justify the execution of a US\ncitizen on the other. The hypocrisy is\nunacceptable.\nToday, we're asking our colleagues to\nstand up for democracy and for the\npeople of this state by supporting\ncommon sense legislation that protects\nthe constitutional rights of US citizens\nand Georgians. SP 389 requiring visible\nidentification and no mask. SP 397\nallowing legal action when\nconstitutional rights are violated. SP\n391 prohibiting entry into schools\nwithout a warrant. And SR 605 affirming\nthe right to protest and the right to\nlegally carry firearms. These are not\npartisan bills. These are bills to\nprotect Georgians and protect our values\nand our rights. Senator.\n>> Yes, sir.\n>> With all due respect,\nyour time has elapsed. So, I would ask\nyou to please yield the well.\n>> I will yield the well. Just understand\nthat the pendulum is swinging and the\nDemocrats are coming. Thank you, Mr.\nPresident. I yield the well.\n>> Chair recognizes senator from the 56 for\na point of personal privilege.\nThank you, Mr. President. I've served in\nthis August chamber for some time, less\nthan a few of you, but more than most of\nyou. And I have to remind everybody\nevery couple of years, this is the\nGeorgia State Senate.\nIt's not the United States Senate. It's\nnot any one of the other 49 state\nlegislatores. It is the Georgia State\nSenate. Now, whether you're trying to\nget on the news or you're trying to run\nfor other office, everyone has a right\nto come to this well, and we respect\nthat.\nBut what I haven't heard in the last\nyear, which just baffles me,\nis the illegal criminal aliens\nwho did the following in Georgia.\nBrought enough fentinel into this state\nto kill half the state's population.\nI didn't hear anyone come up to the well\nand talk about that.\nthe hundreds of drug traffickers that we\ntook off the streets that are not\npoisoning your communities, your\nfamilies, and your children.\nHow about the homicide, manslaughter,\nthe dozens of cases of child aggravated\nmolestation,\nthe child rape and imprisonment,\nthe battery of a child, the felony\nmurder convictions, the incest and child\nmolestations.\nDon't come to this well and say\nacknowledge something that happened in\nanother state when you're not\nacknowledging the very things happening\nin your state that are impacting your\ncommunity.\nIf you want to hold the press conference\nor you want to waste all our time up\nhere talking about whatever you want to\ntalk about, God bless you. But you're a\nGeorgia state senator.\nKeep your eye on the ball and let's\nprotect our communities. Thank you. I\nyield the\nChair recognizes a senator from the 44th\nfor point of personal privilege.\n>> Thank you, Mr. President. Perhaps I'll\nbe our last speaker, colleagues. Who\nknows? Um, I do think it's important to\npoint out that\nthe pattern of behavior that we have\nbeen witnessing in Minnesota and\nMinneapolis actually is simply an\nescalation of what's been going on for a\nyear now. Um, the federal government\nunder the Trump administration\nhas repeatedly violated fundamental\nrights protected by the US Constitution.\nThey've attacked free expression.\nThey've crushed peaceful assembly.\nThey've choked the free press.\nThey've ignored judicial orders and due\nprocess.\nThey've inflicted cruelty on detained\nindividuals.\nNow, it's also that they've murdered two\nAmericans,\nAlex Prey and Renee Good.\nAnd the thing is, Alex Prey was\npeacefully attending a public protest.\nHe legally possessed a concealed\nfirearm. It wasn't visible. He didn't\napproach ICE agents brandishing a gun\ndespite Secretary Gnome's outrageous\ncomments to the contrary.\nHe was simply holding his phone, filming\nthe agents.\nSo, Alex Prey was doing exactly what\nevery law-abiding American gets to do.\nHe was exercising his constitutional\nrights. He was following gun laws\nwritten by Republican legislators.\nHe was carrying legally and protesting\npeacefully. And for that, he was\nmurdered in cold blood.\nAnd now, Republicans, starting with\nPresident Trump, are blaming Alex for\nhis own death.\nThey are using his possession of a gun\nto justify ICE agents killing him in the\nstreets of Minneapolis. And for good\nmeasure, they've trashed his reputation,\nsmeared his name, and inflicted even\nmore pain on his grieving family. So,\nlet's be clear that this is not about\npublic safety. This is about power and\nfollowing the orders of the president.\nSo Trump, his administration,\nand this Republican party have been\nwilling to turn their backs on the\nfirst, fourth, fifth, and eth\namendments.\nThe first now trampling peaceful\nprotest. But what's truly unbelievable\nis watching Republicans turn on their\nfavorite amendment, the Second\nAmendment,\ndefending the killing of a citizen for\nlegally carrying a gun.\nbecause Alex was legally armed. So, the\nsame politicians that made Kyle\nWrittenhouse, a 17-year-old who went to\na protest illegally carrying an AR-15\nand murdered two people, the same people\nthat made that guy a folk hero\nare now silent.\nThe same politicians and Republican\nparty that have told us for decades that\nmore people carrying more guns in more\nplaces makes all of us safer are now\nsilent as Prey is brutally murdered by\nhis own government because he had a gun.\nThat is hypocrisy. But far more than\nthat, that's authoritarianism.\nSo again, the administration is making\nfree speech, peaceful assembly, and\nlawfully carrying a firearm offenses\npunishable by death in America. And we\njust don't we we you I know you think,\n\"Oh, they keep going on about it.\" Well,\nthat's because we don't hear Republicans\ndefending our rights, denouncing the\nkillings, and most importantly, standing\nup to the Trump administration. We also\nheard that we Democrats refused to name\nLake and Riley in in 2024, which is not\ntrue because our former leader and\nmyself both expressed our disgust over\nher murder. And for you, Senator from\nthe 56, yeah, we want to get criminals\noff the streets, illegal alien criminals\nand other criminals. We support that.\nBut we do not support\nthe running a muck of a federal\ngovernment at the orders of one man\nwho's installed only lieutenant minions\nto carry out his orders within his\nadministration, trampling, destroying\nthe rights of Americans and killing them\nfor exercising those rights. And that's\nwhy everyone's angry and that's why\neveryone's scared. This is not what they\nwanted and not what they voted for. The\nConstitution is not a page of\nsuggestions. It is a foundation for our\nsociety. Even though Donald Trump thinks\nonly his own morality is the only thing\nthat can that can stop him from doing\nwhat he wants. That's what he said.\nThat's what he told the New York Times.\nWell, I'm here to say actually it's the\nConstitution and we do expect\nRepublican legislators to make that\nclear for Georgians.\nI urge a a hearing on SR 605\nimmediately. That is why uh the senator\nfrom the 14th and Senate Democrats have\nfiled it. It reaffirms our\nconstitutional rights in the face of\nthese attacks\nand I think it will be pretty telling if\nwe don't have a hearing on SR 605. Thank\nyou, Mr. President. I yield the well.\n>> Senators yielded the well. Chair\nrecognizes senator from the 17th for a\npoint of personal privilege.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nOur constituents, colleagues, our\nconstituents send us to the capital for\none reason\nabove all others, to protect them and to\nensure their rights are respected and\ndefended. What we are saying today\nshould concern every one of us. SR 605\nsimply asks this body to affirm its\ncommitment to civil rights, including\nthe Second Amendment\nrights that the majority so often claim\nto champion. Yet, we refuse to do so.\nNot because those rights lack value, but\nbecause protecting them is politically\ninconvenient for Donald Trump. We do not\nhave a king in this country. We have a\ndemocracy. And if we intend to remain\none, then we must commit to defending\nthe rights of people, not bending them\nto serve any single president. I commend\nmy United States Senator, Reverend\nRaphael Waro, for representing all of us\nwell by traveling to Minneapolis to meet\nwith faith leaders and show his\ncommitment of protecting civil rights\nfor his constituency\nand\nthe constituency across this nation.\nColleagues, I implore you today to be\nchampions of justice. Stand with persons\nwho are engaged in nonviolent resistance\nand protest. Say no to ICE. No to murder\nby federal agents. No to this\nadministration lying about Mr. Alex\nPrieous being an assassin and domestic\nterrorist. Yes, I am a Georgia state\nsenate senator and I stand here today to\nsay that injustice is wrong. Dr. Martin\nLuther King Jr. said, and I quote,\n\"Injustice anywhere is a threat to\njustice everywhere. We are caught in an\ninescapable\nnetwork of mutality tied in a single\ngarment of destiny. Whatever affects one\nindirectly affects all indirectly,\nemphasizing that we all have a\nresponsibility to act against\noppression. So today, I ask you to think\nabout justice.\" Mr. President, thank\nyou. And I yield the whale.\n>> Senators yield to the well. Chair\nrecognizes the senator from the 30th for\na point of personal privilege.\n>> Thank you, Mr. President.\nI'll be brief. I just want to something\nthat concerns me here a little bit. When\nwe talk about law enforcement,\nra law enforcement, whether that be ICE,\nwhether it be our state troopers that we\nsee in the building, our county local\npolice, when we use terms like thugs,\nmurderers, and terrorists describe a law\nenforcement agency,\nwe are rising the temperature and the\nrisk level for our state troopers, our\ncounty deputies, and our local police.\nI think we all support our local law\nenforcement and our state law\nenforcement.\nI think what we are doing with some of\nthe language we're using is putting them\nin a level that they a heightened risk\nanyway on this job. I think we're\nputting them in a more dangered area\nthan what they should be put in by using\nthis language.\nWhen I hear the word terrorist, that's\nconcerning along with the other ones.\nUm, we always talk about lowering the\ntemperature.\nWe need to lower this temperature to\nmake sure our law enforcement officers\nare safe in this state. I'm going to do\neverything I can in my power as a person\nin this body to protect our law\nenforcement officers and get them what\nthey need to do their job and do it\nprofessionally and do it well, which I\nthink every single one of them in this\nstate does a dang good job. So to all\nour state law enforcement officers, DNR,\nGBI, county, city, thank you so much for\neverything that you do and put your\nlives on the line every day for us. So\nthank you so much and I'll yield the\nwell.\n>> Thank you, Senator Chair recognizes,\nbut he's the senator from the 35th, but\nhe's not in his seat.\nI'm not sure he can be recognized if\nhe's not in his seat.\nOh, there he is. Chair recognizes\nsenator from the 35th point of personal\nprivilege. He did a very good job on\nlawmakers last night along with our\nother freshman senator from the 21st.\nThey represented the Senate proud.\n>> All right. Thank you, Mr. President.\nI have a a few burning questions from\neveryone in this body.\nQuestion number one,\nhave our politics become our idol?\nWhat have we sacrificed\nat his altar?\nBack to question number one. Have our\npolitics become our idol.\nFollow-up question. What have we\nsacrificed at his altar?\nIt seems that many of us have\npotentially sacrificed our principles\nat his altar.\nSome of us may have on occasion\nsacrificed courage,\nsacrificed morals.\nBut I want all of us to really ask\nourselves that question.\nHave our politics become\nour idol?\nAfter that question, it's probably good\nto ask if uh that idol created this\nworld. Does that idol hold this world\ntogether?\nMillions of things have to go just right\njust for every person in this room to\ntake a breath.\nAre we going to give our idols credit\nfor that?\nI ask that we acknowledge where we're\ngoing to put our trust, where we put our\nfaith, and dare I say, where we put our\nsecurity.\nI don't claim to have all the answers,\nbut if we can start from that point of\nagreement,\nthen we can get some things done and\nshow the rest of the country how to move\nforward in this space. I yield the well.\nChair recognize the minority leader\nSenator from the 22nd for a point of\npersonal privilege.\nThank you, Mr. President. I'll be brief.\nI just want to read one quite one thing.\nI actually had not planned to come up\ntoday, but when I heard about the fact\nthat we're in the Georgia Senate, maybe\nwe should not deal with this.\nOver the summer, there was an opinion\nwritten that I think every lawyer ought\nto put in their lapel or in their inside\npocket. It was written by Judge\nWilkerson who was a Reagan appointee\nstill on the bench 80 years old Reagan\nappointee and they were dealing with the\nGarcia case and they ruled against the\nadministration.\nThis one paragraph I think actually\nstill fits even what we're talking about\ntoday and the seriousness of it and why\nno matter where you are, you should take\nit seriously.\nAnd what he says is this.\nHe says, \"It is, as we have noted, all\ntoo possible to see in this case, we can\nsay in this particular case we're\ndealing with right now, an incipient\ncrisis, but it may be present, but it\nmay present an opportunity as well. We,\nthe judiciary and America, yet cling to\nthe hope that is not naive to believe\nour good brethren in the executive\nbranch, perceive the rule of law as\nvital to the American ethos.\" This case\npresents dear unique opportunity to\nvindicate that value and to summon the\nbest that is within us while there is\nstill time. That is an amazing powerful\nstatement from a federal court of\nappeals judge Reagan appointee to say\nwhile there is still time. He is telling\nus that bench was telling us\nthere is a crisis going on in America.\nPlease wake up. It's not about where you\nare. It affects all of us. And what he\nsaid in that opinion fits exactly what\nwe're talking about today. when he talks\nabout the case. He was talking about the\nGarcia case there, but he could be\ntalking about this case right here.\nWhile there is still time, an amazing\npowerful statement from a federal court\njudge Reagan appointee. While there is\nstill time, forget about the what\naboutism, what you didn't say over here,\nwhat you didn't say over here. While\nthere is still time to save this\ndemocracy, that is what he said. And I\nthink that anybody and especially\nattorneys in this day and age ought to\nkeep that close to them and understand\nwhat this fight is about while there's\nstill time. Thank you and I yield the\nwelcome.\n>> Are there any other senators wish to\nrise for a point of personal privilege?\nAny other senators?\nChair recognizes a senator from the\n29th.\n>> Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.\nI I guess listening to all of this\nchatter and be clear that's what it was.\nAs everybody came up and spoke,\nI saw one individual that went to the\nsame police academy I went to.\nI saw one individual that went to the\nfirefighters academy and worked\nalongside public safety. And then what I\nsaw scattered about amongst those groups\nwere politicians,\npeople looking for the opportunity.\nBut I'll tell you something that I\nlearned well before I went to the police\nacademy. Something that I learned in my\nGeorgia class that I had to pass when I\nwas in junior high school, which is\nmiddle school to some of you in the\nroom. And what I learned in my social\nstudies class is something called due\nprocess.\nAnd what I heard today is that every\nAmerican who does not wear a badge\nhas the right to due process.\nBut if you do wear a badge, you have a\nright to the jury of a bunch of Georgia\nstate senators\nwho watch, and I quote, viral videos\nwho listen to rhetoric throughout\nthe news cycle on the internet and their\nfavorite targeted silo channel, on their\nfavorite website, or their favorite\nprint publication that may still be in\nexistence.\nBut I'm going to hit you with a news\nflash. The men and women of law\nenforcement, they don't get to sit\nbehind their desk, press their button,\nwrite their speech, grab a laptop or a\ncell phone, and read from it while\nthey're in a critical incident. They\ndon't get to do that. And you know what\nthat means? That means that 99.999%\nof the time, their training is going to\nkick in and they're going to make the\nright decision. And that means that\nfraction that is left over,\na mistake\ncan be made.\nI said a mistake, not an intentional\nthing.\nthe lawyers, the attorneys, those with\nlaw degrees that stood up here and\nspoke, I was amazed at how you avoided\ndue process where if we were talking\nabout somebody charged with rape, if we\nwere charged with somebody charged with\nmurder, if we were talking about\nsomebody charged with anything else\nunder title 16 or even title 40,\nyou'd be holding a press conference and\nscreaming about due process, the right\nto a jury trial, the right to discovery.\nI had heard a one of our colleagues come\nup here and talk about being struck by a\ncar. Apparently, he wasn't on the scene\nwhen we see law enforcement officers who\nare ran over by automobiles and killed.\nHe's never seen law enforcement officers\nbe intentionally ran over when the\nvehicle's used as a weapon against law\nenforcement officers. And I will tell\nyou, most law enforcement officers I\nknow are pretty tough men and women, and\nthey can handle some pretty tough\nadversaries,\nbut you're never going to beat an\nautomobile. I can promise you that. I'm\nnot asking you not to have your opinion.\nI'm not asking you to like law\nenforcement. And please, for the\nhypocrites in the room, which there are\nmany, I have seen year after year after\nyear after year, you frothing at the\nopportunity to demonize the men and\nwomen who wear the badge,\nunless one of them dies,\nunless a member of their family dies,\nand then everybody wants to dawn a black\nveil and pretend that they are law\nenforcement's best friend.\nAnd that is not the case. And sadly, it\nis not the case in this chamber. It is\nnot the case in this building, and it is\nnot the case around this city and other\ncities like it. But I've told you before\nwhat I am, and that's what I will always\nbe. I'm a part of that fraternity. And I\nwill always be. And until I see you\nsitting in a use of force class with me,\nuntil I see you rolling around on the\nground training with me, until I see you\ntry to handcuff me and realize that\nthree of you can't\nwithout it becoming extremely violent\nand I'm going to get my legs in,\nthen please do not judge my brothers and\nsisters while they're out doing their\njob. Ask all the questions you want to\nask, but do not judge. That's for a jury\nto do, not you.\nAnd to the senator from the 35th, you\nare absolutely right. Sometimes politics\nbecomes people's gods.\nThat's why people who claim to be\nministers can stand in the pull pit and\nsupport the murder of unborn children.\nAnd with that, Mr. Chair, Mr. President,\nI yield the well.\n>> Chair recognizes the senator from the\n33rd for a point of personal privilege.\nThank you, Mr. President, my fellow\nsenators, colleagues, friends, and\ny'all.\nThis is not my wedding anniversary as\nthe other senators here came forth, but\nit is the fifth anniversary of me and my\ngirlfriend, Linda. And I want to say,\nLinda, I hadn't forgotten you. But while\nI'm up here, I want to encourage us to\nthink about ways we can move together\nforward in order to resolve this\nsituation that's going on because it's\nnot a good reflection on any of us. I\ndon't care what your persuasion is, but\nI think now moving forward that we\nshould start dialoguing on how we can\ncome together and prevent situations\nlike this from happening in the future.\nThank you, Mr. President. I yield. Well,\nthank you, Senator.\nYou have before you a consent calendar\nof privilege resolutions.\nDoes any senator wish to remove a\nresolution from the consent calendar?\nIs there objection to the adoption of\nthe resolutions on the consent calendar?\nChair hears none and the resolutions on\nthe consent calendar are adopted.\nThank you, Mr. President.
