Good morning to the speaker of the House of Representative David Ralston to this Georgia House of Representatives to my representative, Sister Edna Jackson, to all of you who are here, visitors, staff, workers, friends, and foes alike. I bring you greetings from the St. Philip African Methodist Episcopal Church in Savannah, Georgia, where the Honorable Mayor of An Johnson, the second serves as mayor. St. Philip is the oldest African Methodist Episcopal Church in the state of Georgia, celebrating 157 years in ministry this June, where the greatest first lady, Sister Brenda Young, Heathco, serves with honor and distinction with me. I am the Reverend Dr. J.S. Heathco, Senior, I am the Pastor of St. Philip Church, and I want to thank you for allowing me this opportunity to come and to share with you during this Black History Month, but we celebrate Black History every month. I want to speak this morning on the subject, a charge to keep. In 1762, Charles Wesley wrote a hymn entitled, A Charge to Keep. He based it on the scripture, it lived in Leviticus 8 and 35, when Moses was passing the mantle onto Aaron. He wanted Aaron to continue leading the children of Israel. He told Aaron that he must keep the charge of the Lord, lest he die. It was a reminder that leadership is a life and death commitment to God. The story of Moses and Aaron reminds us that we make decisions that impact the lives of others, and we will have to give an account of our decision making. We must also lead and train others how to be leaders. We must remind each other that there is also a higher power, a power that is greater than you and a power that is greater than me. Charles Wesley penned these words, A charge to keep I have, a God to glorify, a never dying soul to save, to fit it for the sky. He goes on to say to serve the present age, my calling to fulfill. Oh, may it all my powers engage to do my master's will as we do the work of government as we fulfill our call. Let us remember what Abraham Lincoln said in his Gettysburg address. We are a government of the people, by the people, for the people. So let us do what is pleasing in the sight of our God. Let us do what is right for righteousness sake. Let us march on until victory is won because one day we will all stand at the judgment seat. And we will have to give an account of our lives. And we want to hear those words well done, my good and faithful servant. And we will have to give an account of our faithful over a few things. I will set you over many things, enter into the joy of your Lord. You know there is life after life and my prayer is that your life will make a difference. Life needs to make a difference in the lives of others. This is your charge to keep. May we stand. Let us pray. In the words of James Welden Johnson, God of our weary years, God of our silent tears, thou who has brought us thus far on the way, thou who has by thy might, let us into the light, keep us forever in the path we pray. God, we thank you for the opportunity to give service to others. We thank you for allowing us to see another day. We thank you because you have been good to us. Now Lord, help us. Help us to do what it is that is pleasing in your sight. Help us to love our neighbors as we also love ourselves. Help us to make decisions that will benefit all of your people. Help us to fight the good fight of faith. Help us so that when that day comes, when it's your time to call and it's our time to answer, help us to do what it is that needs to be done so that we might hear those words well done. Go with us now that even as we might leave this place and grant that we might not ever leave your presence. He's in the name of the one in whom we serve that we pray and then every heart in this place say, Amen. May we also remember those that are struggling with the possibility of another world war. God bless you. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands. One nation under the God indivisible to liberty and justice for all. I'm going to the door. Doorkeepers will unlock the doors. Members may greet the chaplain in the south any room. Chair recognizes Chairman Hogan, the chair of the Committee on Information and Audits.

If the gentleman so states, I'm sure he believes that to be true. What purpose does Chairman Dickie rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not true that this is the only bill that's been presented for the Bibb County school board and commissioners and at this late date from the Senate and there's no other bill that's been prepared by this Chamber to vote on? I'm sure the gentleman believes that to be true. All right, have all members voted on the motion? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the motion of Representative Paris to remove these two bills from the local calendar and vote separately. The eyes are 67.

So if you have a morning order, you might want to make your way to the front. The messenger starts the clock when we recognize you. Chair recognizes representative Washburn for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, the house I rise today to honor the life and memory of Dr. Tandy Walter Treadwell, who passed away on January 22, 2022. He is a survivor. He is a wife, Betty Treadwell, a brother, a sister, children and great-grandchildren and great-grandchildren. In 2000, Dr. Treadwell retired as chief of family medicine, professor and chair, emeritus at Moser University School of Medicine. The doctor recognizes that God had given him great gifts, and he used those gifts to honor God. And he has done a lot to improve the health care that we are trying to deliver to Georgia. Please, by your head in the moment of silence to honor Dr. Treadwell. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes chairman Setsler for a morning order. I would like to stand today and stay far, far, far from politics and ask folks to rise and have a moment of silence for the human cost that is being exacted in the Ukraine. It is a very complex circumstance. I hope we can have peace, I hope we can have justice, and I hope nations that should be brothers can resolve. I hope the America can be a light for goodness in healing, and I just want to moment of silence of prayer for those in Russian Ukraine. Let's pray. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes chairman Belton for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also rise today to pray for the brave men and women in the United States military and Poland today, who stand in the crutch between war and peace. It is an incontroverable fact that freedom begins and ends along the thin red line of the American soldiers fought and died. The Democrats and Republican presidents were hard to protect, but make no mistake, it is not the politician who wins our freedom. It is American soldier, sailor, airman, and Marines, the greatest peacemaker on the planet. Chair recognizes representative Neil for a morning order. Representative Yasmine Neil, not here, okay. Chair recognizes representative Moore for a morning order. The one that's having a birthday soon. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. In honor of Black History Month, I wanted to share with you all a special moment in Black History that we are celebrating in my community of peace-tree corners. I would like to introduce you to Joseph Citizen Joe Sawyer, who last year was elected as the first Black member of the Peace-tree Corner City Council and first person of color to serve on the council. Joe was born in 1965 and served his country in the army and was honorably discharged as a disabled veteran. He has been married to Kim Sawyer for 30 years, his father-to-law and in-lacy, and as a grandfather to six grandchildren. He co-founded the nonprofit organization Bridges Peace-tree Corners in 2014 to celebrate the diversity and to build coalitions for public service within the city of Peace-tree corners. Everybody who knows Joe loves him. He is just an amazing public servant having served the local fire and police departments, elementary schools. He has been a small business owner for 20 years. He is a two-time cancer survivor and in 2021 was elected to serve our city. I am just so proud of Joe and just want to congratulate him and thank him for his service. Thank you. Chair recognizes Representative Hutchinson for a morning order. Good morning, colleagues. Today in my moment in Black History, I would like to introduce you to Ferman Kristoff. Ferman Kristoff was the secretary for the citizens committee that supported Homer Plessy in the Plessy versus Ferguson case in 1896, which ultimately brought in the separate but equal doctrine. Homer Plessy was my great-great-grandfather. He was a teacher at the Catholic Institute for Indigent Orphans and he later became principal. I have to honor my great-great-grandfather because I feel like I have his energy up here. Thank you very much. This is Speaker A. U.L. The Will. Chair recognizes Representative Roberts for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues. I want to lighten it up a little bit. Laughter is good for the soul. It is priceless medicine that has so much power to heal and compensate. It brings people together, releases tension in the environment and relaxes your nerves, making it both beneficial for emotional and physical well-being. My District 52 is home to one of the greatest sources of laughter, the Punchline Comedy Club. Last night, I had the honor and pleasure of celebrating its 40th anniversary in business by attending Jeff Foxworthy's sold-out show. I have not laughed so hard in a really long time and it truly was medicine for my soul. I want to publicly congratulate the owners, Jamie Bindle, Chris DePeta and Jim Bindle. Punchline has presented top comedians in the industry, including Jeff Foxworthy, who was on the stage at Punchline for the first time 37 years ago. They essentially have grown up together. Eddie Murphy, Steve Harvey, Amy Schumer. Thank you, Punchline. You kept Georgians from across the state laughing over the decades, presenting more than 1,000 comedians, 7500 shows. We're grateful for your contribution to keeping our souls, minds and bodies healthy. And if you all haven't been there, you really need to go see a show. It'll restore your soul. Representative Roberts, are you suggesting that that's better entertainment than the general assembly of Georgia? Just making sure. I think I know what the next morning order is about. Chair recognizes Representative Kendrick for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. This is my annual morning rent for those of you that have a birthday outside of the legislative session. You know that we don't get to hear the speaker's name or get a round of applause. My birthday is August 28th. The same day as the late Representative John Meadows and the same day Dr. King has his, I have a dream speech. So right now, if your birthday falls outside of the legislative session, as you stand up and wave so that our colleagues can give us our due, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Representative Kendrick always remembers the forgotten. All right, we're going on now to the rules calendar. Going on to the rules calendar, the clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1307. If you let me know that, I'll make sure there's. House Bill 1307, a resident of Houston, and 170th to be entitled an act to amend in Title 25. The official go to Georgia, anti-divided, related to fire protection and safety. He shows the revised the Georgia Utility Facility Protection Act. This will have referred to the Committee on Energy Utilities and Telecommunications. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. The chair recognizes chairman Houston to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I just want everybody to know that this is a very non-partisan bill. And not only is it a non-partisan bill, it is a common sense bill. And I don't see how anybody can find anything wrong with it to you the truth. But this bill, this bill simply codifies existing PSC training for excavators to call 911. And it accidentally strike a gas line or hazardous material line. The federal auditors are requiring that we put this into law. We passed this bill last year. It was part of another bill that went to the Senate and the bill that it was attached to did not pass. So we're asking that this bill is standing on bill so we can receive more audit credit points. We were real lucky last year. This house passed a bill and we put $150,000 into hiring more people call before you dig. And we thought our points would go up so much that we would return $300,000, but we return $500,000 to the state. And hopefully this will bring us more money. I'd be glad to ask any questions. You yield for questions? Yes. Chair recognizes chairman Nick's. Do you ride for a question? Is it not true that if I'm out there digging and I hit that gas line, I'm going to call on a lot higher power than the PSC. Yes, sir. I'm sure they will too. And the PSC already trained to excavate us to do this. But we just just going by the what the feds want us to do and put it in law. Thank you. That's a great point. You prefer the yield? Yes, I'll yield one more question. Chair recognizes representative Cannon. Do you're left for a question? Good morning. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Do you yield? Yes. So the bill that it was attached to last year, was it germane? What was that bill about and why didn't it pass? It had something to do with the excavators. I don't know what the bill was. They just tell me it was in another bill that did not move in the Senate. That we passed it in the house and it did move in the Senate. It was not that it was excavators. But I'm not sure what it what it's saying. No further questions. Thank you. I yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here's none.

This bill having referred to the committee on Game Fish and Parks. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. This is not another record bill is it or a dead carcass bill. Chair recognizes Chairman Rhodes to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. No, sir. This has nothing to do. This is going to get our Williams up here. I promise. The ladies and gentlemen, House Bill 1233 is our annual DNR update. It does just a few simple things. This updates the rules and regs from our DNR board from the past year. And does were accidentally left out of the current language. So we're using the term migratory game bird to include all of our game birds. And we consolidate it all of our black bass into one species into one category. And also accidentally the three shell limit was left out of our migratory game bird section. And we're just it's always been federal code and we're going back to just mere federal code. Mr. Speaker, that's the bill. I'll answer any questions. Do you hear for a question? Yes, sir. I'll take one. Chair recognizes Chairman Hogan to your left for a question. Does it is gentleman yield? I should not to you, but I will. Does this protect my duct from hunters like you? If you can if you can get one with three shells, it doesn't. Well, you still not welcome on my farm to shoot my ducts. And we'll see. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is not. The previous question is ordered.

The official go to Georgia and to the quality of basic education access to the required for the inclusion of methods for the promotion of the safe and appropriate use of technology. House Bill, I'm in front of the committee on Education Act. Committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative Irwin to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and colleagues. I bring before you today the Student Technology Protection Act. This bill needs to be in place to secure the state owned servers and devices that have been delivered to the kids and the students used today in the environment we're in, which is the virtual learning environment that is going on. You can only imagine how much more learning we are doing on the internet and with devices that we're handing children that they're taking home. We must secure those with filters and firewalls. These are in line with a bill and updated a bill that we passed in this chamber in 2006, which was House Bill 1055. It's also in line with a SIPPA law which was passed by Congress and only lastly updated in 2011. So with this new learning that is taking place there is a need to secure and protect our children in this course in the virtual environment. A few high points are the DOE is getting very involved in providing their expertise. We'll be able to monitor the activity on the internet as well as those devices for our children. I want to thank the different groups such as the DOE, the Gail Association, GSSA, Pro Tem, Jones and Chairman Dubnik for their assistance and all of their help in crafting this bill. Mr. Speaker, with that I'll yield for question. You do yield. Yes, sir. Chair recognizes the Chair of the Education Committee, Chairman Dubnik, to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. With the gentleman, you? Yes, sir. Representative, everyone, is it not true that you stated that the federal government last addressed the law that protects our children for certain information in 2011? That is correct. So you're telling me that the federal government is 11 years behind on technology? Yes, sir. I am. And I'm also going to state to the gentleman that it is important for us to protect Georgia children, not only to rely on Washington to protect Georgia children, but for Georgia to protect Georgia children. Thank you very much. One final. If you yield? Yes, sir. Will? Is it not true that this bill, House Bill 1217, is an example of how this house and this state are leading to set an example for the country of how we protect our children? Man, those are what he speaks of. With that, Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the well and ask for your favorable consideration. Gentlemen, is yielded the well? Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee Substitute? The Chair here is none. The Committee Substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the Committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair here is none. The report of the Committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. What purpose does representative McLeod rise? Parliamentary inquiry? The State of the United States is not sure that this particular bill, although we are definitely looking to make sure that we protect our children, does not cover audio pornography? I would encourage you to maybe find the author and get some clarification on that. What purpose is representative Cannon rise? Parliamentary inquiry? The State of the United States is not sure. I'm sorry I can't hear you, representative. Now. Thank you. Is it not true that this bill will implicate parents and educators who are at home schools with them right now coming from public schools? And additionally, that this bill is not yet inclusive enough of how we protect our students as an educator I am concerned. I'm sure if the lady so states she believes that to be true. What purpose does Chairman Martin rise? Parliamentary inquiry. The State of the United States is not sure. Isn't it true, Mr. Speaker, that as the gentleman presented the bill he said that it would filter websites and places that could be accessed by these computers and by doing that filter isn't it, Mr. Speaker, that those websites that protect audio that might be inappropriate will also be filtered out? Isn't that true? I think that to be true. All right, final parliamentary inquiry. What purpose does representative Kenner rise? Parliamentary inquiry? Like you're inquiry. Is it not true that I contacted Gwyneth County Public Schools today and they agree with the intent of this bill but to operationalize it would be a cost of up to $4 million and the results would be limited as it would not filter individuals bringing their own personal devices, therefore negating the opportunity. The gentleman so states I'm sure he believes that to be true. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines. On the passage of House Bill 1217, the eyes are 131. The days are 26. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption. The House Bill 1008. House Bill 1008, by Roves of Hawkins, the 27th and others to be titled, an act to amend Article 11 and Chapter 3, Title 20 and Chapter 9 and Title 30, the fiscal to Georgia, annotated relating to higher education savings plan and Georgia achieving a better life experience. This bill I refer to the Committee on Budget and Fiscal Affairs Oversight. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Hawkins to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. In 2016, this legislature passed the Abel legislation. This legislation allowed the disabled and families of the disabled to save an excess of $2,000 without losing their liability by establishing a $529 plan. This plan was, the cost of this plan was borne by the participants. With that in mind, we combined our Georgia plan with other states in Ohio that had the mechanism for these plans to work. With this summer, the treasurer of this state, Steve McCoy, called me with an idea of moving the plan back to Georgia administration of the plan, folding the board of directors available into the higher education board, both being 529 plans to make it much more efficient and also benefit the Abel board. In section 1 of the bill, you'll see that the Georgia Higher Education Board is expanded to include the commissions of DCH and behavioral health and developmental disabilities and also a person with disabilities or a member of a family thereof. Also I've been asked about the Governor being taken off as chairman. In years past, we have placed the Governor as chairman of many of these boards. Well, the last 20-30 years, we've created a lot of boards and it's become impractical for the Governor to be the chairperson of the board. So this just cleans out language up. The chairperson will be elected by the board and the treasurer will serve as vice chair. In section 2, the board of directors of the Abel program will be replaced by the board of the Higher Education Savings Program. In section 3, it foals those operations into the Higher Education Board and secures the previous assets. Some final points. It's important to note that the accounts of the Higher Education 529 plan and the Abel 529 plan will remain separated. Seventeen other states have done this to combine their boards and have increased their operational efficiency. Right now, our Higher Education assets in the past two college sits at $4.6 billion. Impressively, our Abel account is a mere $12 million. So in conclusion, I would also like to tell you that our Commissioner, Judith Fitzgerald, advised our committee that the majority of them roleees of the Abel program have intellectual behavior disabilities. And as we all know, this legislature and this Governor this year is focusing on improving mental outcomes and mental health in this state. Your conclusion, I would ask, for your favorable consideration of HB108. I miss speak of this. No questions? I'll yield the way. There are no questions. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Members voted. Have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 1008. The eyes are 159. The nays are zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. We'll read the caption to House Bill 1088. House Bill 1088, the president of Gunner of the 8th to be titled an act of men, part 7 of Article 5, which after 3, title 44, the fiscal to George Antieta related to miscellaneous provisions regarding time share projects and programs. So as to authorize nonjudicial foreclosure of time share of states, this bill will refer to the committee on judiciary. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes Chairman Gunner to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, this bill applies only to time shares in Georgia. It changes it from a judicial foreclosure to a nonjudicial foreclosure. The reason being is that in a judicial foreclosure, it gets rather expensive, hiring an attorney and then going through that process. The nonjudicial foreclosure is very similar to the judicial, the owner gets the notice. It's run in the paper for four weeks and it advertises where the foreclosure will take place. It also protects any leans that a bank or lending institution may have against a time share. There's been no objection from the real estate lawyers to this bill. I'll answer any questions that you may have. Do you yield for a question? I do. Chair recognizes minority leader Beverly to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, to gentlemen. You. I just have a quick question. What is the total time around time from the attaching of the lean to the proposed sale of the property? What is the total time that you take? I don't know that there's any set time on that for a time share, but it's when it gets to a point where the fees have built up so much that that's when they would foreclose on it. It's an owner's association decision as to whether to foreclose. Do you further yield? Yes. Chair recognizes representative Carter up in the gallery to your left for a question. All right. Good morning, Mr. gentlemen. Yield. A yield? My question is relating to the foreclosure, after the foreclosure. If there is a time share that is paid in full and it's being foreclosed because of the fees, do the profit from the sale go back to the owner of the property? In that situation, I doubt there would be a foreclosure if it's all paid up. The initial purchase of a time share is not very expensive. It's the fees that build over time. So if they haven't paid the fees and it's at a point where they can declare a foreclosure, they would then do that. It's the owner's association's fees, so basically they eat the fees. That's the gentleman further yield? Yes. Sometimes shares are not cheap. So the value of the property they had a lien on it is separate from the bill, from the fees. So if the property itself is paid in full and you're only paying the fees to maintain the time share, with the profits from the sale of the time share, go back to the owner after the fees are paid. When the sale is announced, the fees that have accrued are really what they're recouping from the sale. So all of that would go to the owners association and not back to the owner of the time share. It would divest the owner of the time share from their ownership of the time share. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, I yield the well at this time and ask for your favorable consideration. The gentleman has yielded well. Chair recognizes representative dryer to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'll be brief. And I'm mentioning this to the representative that's sponsoring the bill. I don't have a specific objection to this process for time shares, but I do want to let everybody know what happens in a non-judicial foreclosure and it's specifically important when it comes to people's homes. When people are behind on their mortgage, there will be an advertisement run in the paper as required for a couple of weeks that will culminate in a sale. If you are down at the Fulton Courthouse on the first Tuesday of a month at 10 a.m., you will see a pack of people with cash or cash equivalents, literally cashier checks or lines of credit bidding on people's properties. A few years ago, there was a federal indictment of collusion of those individuals standing around and the individual went to jail, said, I had no idea it was wrong that we were picking and choosing properties that we would bid on because everyone does it and everyone's always done it. In other states, Florida where they have a judicial foreclosure process for people's homes, you can look online and you can bid over a 30-day period or longer. Do you actually get a true market value sale? You don't get fair market value on the Courthouse steps. It is absolutely impossible. When that is someone's home, if that was a family member's home who were losing their generational wealth, I think we would all treat it a little differently. That's not pertaining to this bill today. Timeshares are a different process. There is a good argument for it to be streamlined, but when it comes to people's homes, I think we should be better as a state. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair hears none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee's substitute? The chair hears none. The Committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair hears none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? So the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 1088. The eyes are 141. The nays are 18. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 896. House Bill 896 by the rep. Crow of the 110th being titled an act to amend Code Section 48540. The fiscal to Georgia annotated relating the definitions for property tax exemptions. So to update the population bracket and census date on certain property tax exemptions. This bill I refer to the Committee on Ways and Means. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes representative Crow to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen. I'm here to present House Bill 896. This is a very specific bill and it's really an update to an existing code. All we're doing in this bill is updating the numbers to the update the population bracket for the 2020 census from the 2010 census. What this does is it allows the, it identifies buts county specifically and allows property owners on Jackson Lake who are owners of leasehold properties, Georgia power leasehold properties to claim home set exemption. This bill was first introduced at least prior to 1991 and has been updated every 10 years since I believe in 2012. The last time Chairman Knight was a co-spotter on that alone, my predecessor and it passed the House unanimously. With that, I would ask for your favorable consideration and you have for questions if there are any. You do not have any questions? You'll the well, thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Now this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted?

So it's to remove a provision that reduced the amount of certain funding provided to state charter schools. Let's Bill ever refer to the committee on education. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Excuse me. I know you I know you're anxious to get up there. I guess I would be too if I had that many pages to go over from the well. Representative is all of that about this bill. Chair recognizes representative Brad Thomas to present the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I tried not to tip off everybody that this is my first bill but we'll go ahead and get that out of the way. So I'm very proud. It's funny I got butterflies in my stomach. I think the less time that happened to me was when I met my wife. So all right.\n\nSo I'm here to present LC HB 1215 LC number, I'm sorry, number LC 490864S. It's a charter school bill. It refines the State Charter School definition to the Department of Education, the way the Department of Education already utilizes. And it basically puts an alignment with the Federal Charter School program to be eligible for grants. The second section of this bill prevents local school districts from prohibiting students from transferring to charter schools during the school year. This is creates parity between the public school system and the public charter school system. The third section of this bill, it honors the spirit of the funding for locally approved charter schools and it does this by creating the true provision that's done semi-annually, which is something that's already done in the public school system. So it will create the same way in the public charter school system. The sections 4 and 5 were requests by the State Auditors Office and specifically, this is the change noting the existing requirements outlined in code sections 20-2-2076 and 20-2-2093 are redundant and time consuming and costly for the Department of Audits. So additionally, all this information is already publicly available. So it's supported by the State Charter Schools Commission and the Auditors Office, so we pick that up as well and that's kind of the meat of the potatoes of the bill. I'd be happy to yield for questions at this point. I'm sure your board is lighten up like a Christmas tree. A very large Christmas tree. Thank you. Chair recognizes Chairman of the Station that you're left for a question. Is it Jim and Neil? I do. Chair, did you, did I hear you correct that you just equated a change to title 20 with the same feeling you had when you met your wife? I have to tell you, charter schools are very important to me, but not as important as my wife. Sir, are you concerned at all that she may be watching this or seeing it right now? Oh, I know she is. That's why I called her out the first time I went in the well. Did you, did you, did you, did you, did you, did you, did you, did you, did you, did you, lady, wrong and you cannot speak well. Okay, well, you're going home to not never, you've only needed the rules of the house, but not being recognized for you getting well, but, well, Mr. Speaker, I will make sure I'll let her know that she was on my mind as I approach the well and thoroughly.

There is no A and B, sir. No purpose is representative canon rise. Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not true that as an educator in this body I think that we've taken a tone to this legislation that it's been a joke whether or not funding for our public schools stays with those students and actually helps them and I wish and I'm very concerned of the way that we debated this today. I'm sure the lady will use that to be true. What purpose does representative singles and rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Is that true inquiry? I'm a speaker is it not true that in honor of his first bill I just wanted to let him know that I really do support this legislation. I'm really glad that Brad's being it so I just want to make that part of the record. Okay. Have all members voted? Have all members voted?

This bill was proposed by the Georgia Educational Audiology Advisory Committee and I have letters of support from the Department of Public Health and from the Georgia Academy of Audiologists. As many of you know the way we, in the past 30 years it's changed the way we screen people for hearing and I have a passion that our children who have hearing disabilities are screens so we can learn to read earlier.

So, Campbell 15 to be entitled to amend chapter 24, Title 33. The fiscal to Georgia and it's headed related to insurance generally so as to provide for exclusions to unfair trade practices and on lawful inducements. This bill I refer to the committee on insurance. The committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative Gamble to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, House Bill 1059 will allow insurers and agents to offer lost mitigation products in the sale of insurance. Currently, if an insurer or agent provides products, it's considered to be an illegal rebate or inducement which is prohibited under the law. This would allow those items to be sold or used with the sale of insurance. These are items like smoke detectors, water leak sensors. It's still regulated under the Department of Insurance and this language comes from National Association of Insurance Commissioners Model Law. With that, Mr. Speaker, that's pretty much the extent of the legislation I'm happy to entertain any questions. Do you yield for a question? I will yield. Chair recognizes representative Cannon to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Do you yield? I yield. Can you speak a little bit more to the conversation about what these actual inducements are? What kind of items these are that we're talking about? Yes. So, the whole idea here is that if we're able to offer these types of lost mitigation technologies to potential customers and clients, that it will deploy these technologies in their homes, which of course would lower the lost potential, whether it be a fire or a water leak or those types of things. So, think water leak detectors and smoke detectors, things like that. That's what these technologies are. And it really benefits all of us because it helps us to minimize the loss that we might incur otherwise. So, I appreciate the question. Is that Mr. Speaker? If there's no other question. Do you do have one other if you care to yield? I will yield. Chair recognizes representative Williams Rick Williams to your left for a question. Does the gentleman yield? I yield. Okay. If my insurance company offers me one of those green little lizards, do I have to accept it? Well, that is not a lost mitigation object. So, that's not what we're allowing under this. But you're not trying to make sure. Yeah, thank you for the question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none.

That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes Chairman Hawkins to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You know, for years we've been asking the wrong question. That is, can we see the contracts? The right question would have been, can we see the data? That's what this bill does. 1276 is going to require the insurers to provide the data on Medicaid state health benefit and pitch care on the DCH website and the prominent place. You know, we all want good healthcare for Georgia's, but to find that good healthcare, we need to have good solutions in the ever changing landscape of healthcare.
