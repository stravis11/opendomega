We will begin the day as is our custom with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the lady from the 103rd House District representing Suhong. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and good morning, colleagues. I am delighted to introduce pastor Jung Hoon's son from the Korean community Presbyterian Church or KCPC in Gwinnit County. Many Korean immigrants like my family did find a sense of home community and resources at our churches when we first moved to America. KCPC is one of the oldest and the largest Korean American churches here in Georgia. They have over 2,000 members and they focus a lot on missionary work all over the world as well as a lot of the prison systems here in Georgia. Before pastor Sun started at KCPC in 2019, he started his own ministry in Seoul and grew it in San Diego as well as Hong Kong. His wife Rachel Ann is here if you can stand up. She is a professor at the Denver Theological Seminary as well and they have two sons who attend B for schools which is in the great district of 103. I'm excited to have pastor Sun as our chaplain this morning and I'm excited to hear from him. Pastor Sun. Good morning everyone. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, representative Su Hong, met Reeves and all the chamber members for inviting me to this special occasion. I'm so honored. I'm so honored to be here. As I was preparing my sermon, I asked AI, Artificial Intelligence Service. What do politicians and pastors have in common? The AI service replied, well, they always promise a better future and never deliver. What? At first I thought that was not fair, but I began to think about it more seriously. Am I a really a promise keeper as a pastor? How about yourself? Are you faithful? Are you faithful to the promise you made to God and people who sent you to this chamber? If you are having difficulty delivering the promise you have made, let me introduce you to the words of advice from the Bible. For Samuel 268 says, the Lord brings death and makes a life. The Lord sends poverty and wealth. He humbles and he exalts. He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash hip and prowls to six sevens as. But the Lord gives wisdom from his mouth comes knowledge and understanding. He holds success in store for the upright. He is shield to those whose walk is blameness. Bible clearly says that he is the provider and protector of his people. He is the source of every good thing we need, such as wisdom, courage, and wealth. He is also the shield of everything we cherish. Therefore, no matter how hard the issues we confront, we should never settle for a mediaco solution. Instead, we must pray hard, think hard, research hard, or even debate hard until we come up with this best solution for the wishes we need to tackle for the great state of Georgia. I know a wonderful man of God who was not satisfied with this mediaco solution and used God given inside to transform countless Korean lives. His missionary William A. Linton from Thomasville, Georgia. He graduated from Georgia Tech with top honors and left general metrics where his future was secure. He boarded a ship to an unknown country of Joseon, Joseon, presently Korea, to serve as a missionary. Representative Dallin Taylor, she is from Thomasville. Where are you by the way? Thank you for sending that great man to Korea 111 years ago. Let's see the picture of the family. Once he landed at Kunsan, a small town in South Korea in 1912, he taught Bible and English and he established many schools including Gurswony School and started modern education. But during the Japanese colonial period, he refused to bow down before Japanese got the Shinto shrine so he was expelled from the country by the Imperial Army. However, he returned to Korea after the liberation and founded this Hannam University that you are seeing right now, the picture, and when the Korean War was ended. In fact, one of our associate pastor Greggit from that university, Samoksan, would you wave your hand? It's one of the graduate of that Hannam University. Not only that, Linton's family is Third Sun, Hugh Linton, and his son Steve and John became missionaries too that helped to build colossus victims in Korea. Also, the fourth generation of the Linton family is still helping North Korean hospital and patients. Missionary Horace Grant Underwood and his descendants were another faceful man of God and we create deeply owe to him. Would you show a picture of this Horace missionary? Horace Grant Underwood, especially my wife here and I are the direct beneficiary of his ministry because we got the best Christian education from the university called Yonsei and which was founded by this missionary when he was 26 years old and in 1985. He and his four generations of children continued missionary\n\nin Korea, building schools, hospitals, and churches, publishing Korean English dictionaries, and contributing significantly to the country's democratization. As we talk about the great man of God, we cannot pass by without mentioning the 50,000 U.S. officers and soldiers who lay down their lives during the Korean War. Without their dedication, South Korea would not have been able to attain the freedom and democracy that we enjoy these days. That's why we, our church ministers, to the Korean War veterans like this. There are now only 30, 30 Georgian veterans left, all of whom are well over 90 years. So we really appreciate their effort. Those are the people who have the wisdom and courage to live out the promises they made. They have made to God and the country to the people. I can't say that I fully understand the difficulties you face daily to accomplish the mission given to you. But I know for sure that what you are experiencing is not the first time in history, because history appeared itself. Most experienced racial, gender, and moral issues when he lay head to lead two million refugees out of Egypt to the promised land. King David also had to persuade those who had won great booties in a battlefield. So they fought this fight and collected these booties. And then these soldiers didn't want to share it with the other soldiers who were defending their families and their properties. A good leader, I believe, does not always follow the people to where they want to go. But instead, they tell and guide people where they must go. You not only represent the voters of your district, but I believe you are also supposed to lead them in the right direction. If Moses had followed the people's wishes, he would have returned to Egypt, because they complained. That way, we were better off when we were in Egypt in slave. But Moses didn't listen to them, because he had a clear vision of the promised land. If King David had followed the opinion of the soldiers who fought on the battlefield and wanted to keep all the booties themselves, the nation would be divided. But David did not. He said, no way, we're going to share all the booties with the people who are left behind. But still doing their job. That way, David were able to unite the kingdom together. To be a good leader, we need a godly wisdom to discern the truth and the courage to practice that truth. Dear fellow leaders in the chamber, if you seek wisdom from God, our provider, our protector, I firmly believe that he will surely give it to you. May God bless you and all the Georgians abundantly. Let us pray. Heavenly Father, we pray that you may grant wisdom and courage to these representatives who serve on behalf of the state of Georgia. Please give them the wisdom to discern the truth in this chaotic age, and the courage to practice what they promised before God and people. Help them all to be promised keepers. Also, I pray that you may help them. Device the best policy for all God's children. That's just for us. That's just for our generation or our region and our country. Help us to remember God's word, that says, when Colonel of Wheat falls to the ground and dies, he produces many seed. Help us all to lead. Our state by serving them diligently, we are Georgia, become one state under God, and the safest and strongest and most prosperous state in all of America. So we can be a great channel of blessing for others. We pray all these things in the precious name of our Jesus Christ, the Savior of the Lord, Amen, and amen. The door keepers will unlock the doors. Members, you may greet the chaplain in the south any room and we do appreciate that message here this morning at devotion. Very important. Thank you.

Just a few day. Oh Good luck. Thanks, sir. Thank you, mr. Speaker Good morning y'all Y'all are about to find out how passionate I am about motor vehicle carrier bills Today I rise on behalf of house bill 175 This is a piece of legislation that amends code section 40-1-8 of OCGA It is an annual bill that we do to replace the previous year with the current year in the code section This definition change efficiently codifies updated commercial vehicle and driver safety rules for proper safety enforcement in our state um However without this legislation amendment um To Georgia law enforcement officers primarily in the motor carrier compliance division would be unable to enforce The law as it stands. So we We are favorable to this and I hope you will be too Uh further it could put Georgia at risk for losing federal funding for these enforcement issues Each year the date must be codified into Georgia law to legally correspond with codified present Regulations of federal commercial vehicle safety standards And plain people words um, this bill updates the year to make sure that the state stays and Compliance with federal regulations and keeps our drivers on the road safe And I ask for your favorable consideration Will the gentleman lady yield for a question? I will Have one here from the one hundred and seven oh no, that's you Somebody you mentioned you master button for a question in the back Did not Well, you do have one from the gentleman from the twenty-night chairman d'Ivnick is Has an important question for you straight straight in front of you on the left. Thank you mr. Speaker with a lady yield I do Representative I was looking over this last night late in the night and I ran out of a little bit of time if you'll look with me online 14 I have a question you reference here this bill reference the present regulations promulgated under section 49 of the code of federal regulations I'm sure you're aware there's a subtitle a with 99 parts and subtitle b with 12 parts But I was curious if you could Address this body and explain to us which of those regulations are promulgated and in effect as of January 1st of this year I believe that in the same way you found them anyone curious can also find them in section 40-1-8 Yeah, I was really curious about that 99th section where it refers back to the powers being Related and conveyed to the state. So how will these federal regulations and your new state law be in Support of one another or are they going to be in conflict one? No, they should be in support of one another That is the entire purpose of this I look forward to seeing that written description of how they'll be in concert with one another I think the gentleman can go with to the ladies desk when she completes this and she can explain it to him That was kind of my question, but I thought I think the next Question will really get drilled down to what my question is about This bill and that's someone to recognize the gentleman from the 125th House District Represented for him in for her question Thank you miss speaker to the general lady in the well I appreciate you bringing this and actually I think you did a good job for your first bill But here's my concern if you'll look on page two of the bill Even if we pass this and the Senate passes it and the governor signs that there is no enactment date on the bill I believe that once the Senate signs it and the governor signs it the enactment day and the Constitution is July 1st The lady has done her homework. Congratulations Well Will that scare to will a lot of questions right there without answer I'm just telling you I think you're pretty much ready But let's do one more to maybe two more The gentleman from the fourth chairman\n\nhas a very important question. Does the general lady you? I do, or now. I actually tried to call you from your microphone and the speaker would not let me speak to you. But my question is, would you like me to hit the green button or the red button on this boat? You know, I'm pretty young. I think it can make my way back to my seat to vote for my own bill. How are we done? Two more. He said two more. The gentleman from the 116th has a burning question representative, Holly. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the general lady yield? I do. It's not true that while this is necessary to match our state regulation with the federal regulation with regard to the commercial or the trucks that are on our expressway, the truth is is that while I miss the local scroll that you now have in your district, the truth is that this will do nothing to improve the load of traffic in Henry County. Is that true? That is absolutely true, which is why I'm excited. I am on the Transportation Committee. Hopefully we can do something for the traffic in Henry County. And, you know, he's doing an excellent job. Thank you for bringing this. Thank you, Representative. She needs your help and all our help on that. This is the last one I think we have here. And he's been asking for a while. So seatmate back there, the gentleman from the 17th representative, Montaghan. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is the general lady yield. Of course. So I was looking at this bill that you've got. And congratulations on your first bill. But, hitting on the bank page, it says that all vise and porceless and conflict with this act will reveal. Can you tell me in detail what vise you're revealing? I love that question. I yield the will. The lady has yielded the will. The lady has yielded the will. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. The report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machine. We could lock the machine, Drew. Have all members voted? One more time. Have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of the bill, the yeas, well, 171 yeas were 171. Well, the nays were zero. You'll change your minds. The bill having received the requisite constitution majority is therefore passed. The clerk will read the caption to hb183. House Bill 183, members, an apartment of the fifth to be entitled back to amend. Code section 1611112 in chapter 2, a total 40. The fiscal to Georgia annotated relating vehicles with false or secret compartments and registration and licensing of motor vehicles. This bill lemme refer to the committee on motor vehicles. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Representative Barton is recognized to present the bill. Ladies and gentlemen, I have with you a house bill 183. The LC number is 39624. This is the bill we passed last year and made it through the committee and rules at the Senate side, but it got hung up at the very end. This is the Department of Revenue bill. This bill pretty much is just changing the verbiage of temporary loss of the plate to temporary operating permit. And the reason why dealers, the Department of Revenue and commissioners, they all call them tops. And they just want the lingo, the state law to go along with what they're saying. And that's the essence of this bill. Gentlemen, you have no questions. Will you do have a question? Does the gentleman yield? I yield. The gentleman from the 100th and the 9th representative declined to your left. Has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, sir. Yes, I just noticed you were up, but we missed you in HB 175 because we were looking for you, but you were presenting the bill. So Mr. Speaker, I would like to make sure that you noticed that he was present, but he didn't vote on HB 175. But now does the gentleman yield for my question? Yes, sir. So on HB 183, online 62. You were asking about the operating permit. Do you know exactly when, in accordance with the paragraph, when it will go into effect? With the paragraph, if it went into effect, it will go into effect upon the Governor's signature or your last question. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the bill. Thank you for the question, and thank you for the presentation. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The gentleman has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favourable to the passage of the bill? Chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favour of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. The clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill. The yeas were 172, the nays 0. The bill haven't received the requisite constitutional majority. Is therefore passed. That completes our rules calendar. We're going to move on to afternoon orders. Representative Crawford is recognised for an afternoon order. Representative Murray Crawford. You're recognised, Representative. Representative Murray Crawford. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the body and friends, good morning. I am Murray Crawford from the 84th District. It's an honour to stand before you today for this black history month moment. Don't ask what the world needs, but ask what makes you come alive and go and do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. And as you go throughout this journey, you will have to understand that there will be challenges. But you can overcome those challenges with hard work and preparation, most importantly, to be successful. My person took her chance and cracked the glass ceiling with a strong serve and an even more impressive backhand. Out the Agipson became the first African American to win a grand slam title, but long before making history, she was born in the segregated south and moved with her family up to New York, where she began to fall in love with tennis at a young age. After just a year of playing, she became a local star. And her talent would take her to this school in Tallahassee, Florida, and the University on a full athletic scholarship. She was successful in college, but as a professional, she struggled because she could not play in a lot of the segregated matches, but nonetheless, her talent would make room for her. And she would get her chance. In 1950, she became the first black woman to play in the US nationals. In 1958, she became the female of the year after winning the French Open, the Wimmelton and the US nationals being the first black tennis player to do so. She was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame, and what did she do after she retired from tennis, or she went on to break the color barrier, and the Ladies' Professional Golf Association. Out the Agipson is a strong and emblematic example of what happens when your preparation meets opportunity and you're given a chance. So ladies, the next time someone tells you that you play like a girl, take it as a compliment. Mr. Speaker, thank you and I yield the well. Thank you, Representative. Chairman Jasper's recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. For the 35 members of the Transportation Committee, we do have a meeting this afternoon. It's in 606. You know, there will be a two-hour meeting. There will be a vote held on Representative Meeks, this bill 189. The members of that committee, please check your email. There has been a sub, and so you need to take a look at it. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Representative During Carter is recognized for an afternoon order. Representative Carter. Okay, I was hoping we have a picture. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today, I want to bring your attention to a great Georgian. His name is Thomas Wiggins, born May 25, 1849. Thomas Blin, Thomas Blin, Tom Wiggins was a virtuous pianist, gifted composer, and one of the most in-demand musicians of his time in America, in a 19th century. He was able to perform any musical piece in his entirety with little effort and a mass, a repertoire of thousands of pieces of literary art over his lifetime. Wiggins was born Thomas Green in Harris County, Georgia, blind at birth. He was sold in 1850, along with his enslaved parents, charity and domingo Wiggins. At an early age, he showed an interest in the piano after hearing instruments played by the age of four, reportedly he had acquired some piano skills by ear and gained access to a piano. By age five, Tom reportedly had composed his first tune, the rainstorm, after a torrentia downpour of ten roofs. The line-time began touring the United States at the age of eight, and at the age of ten became the first black musician to give a headline performance at the White House. In 1866, at the age of 16, Tom was taken on a European concert tour, testimonials about Tom's natural talus from composer pianists Ignat's Mochiles, and pianist conductor Charles Helle. These were printed in the booklet, the marvelous musical prodigy Blind Tom, and used to bolster Tom's international reputation. He is referenced as the 167th most famous autistic person in the world. If you would, if you have the opportunity there doing a documentary, you can look up Blind Tom, but he was born blind and autistic into slavery and look at what he did. That is my moment in Black History. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield the will. Thank you, Representative. Chairman Cooperter, quickenized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Speaker. Yesterday my community lost a great man, a man that never made a stranger. Robert Buie, aka Baby, was an icon at the Oakwood Cafe. He was loved by all who met him. Robert came directly to us from incarceration. He is an illustration that criminals deserve a second chance, and if put in the correct environment they will succeed. With all this talk about tough on crime, it's easy to forget that it's people, not government, that will solve the revolving door of our prison system. We must learn to forgive, love people where they're at. Julie and I and the kids will miss you dearly. Rest in peace. Chairman Sains is recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
