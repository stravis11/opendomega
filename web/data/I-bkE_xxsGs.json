secure the chamber at\nthis time\nI want to recognize the senator Defender\n53rd for the second time today as as in\nhe's got the chaplain of the day\nhe's trying to tell us something ladies\nand gentlemen\nI recognize our good senator from the\n53rd uh for our pledge allegiance and\nour chaplain of the day senator\nthank you Mr President let's pledge to\nthe flag\npledge allegiance to the flag\none nation under God indivisible with\nliberty and confesses for all now the\nGeorgia flag\nI pledge allegiance to the Georgia flag\nthe principles for which it stands\nsystem Justice moderation and courage\nso this is uh two days in a row now I've\nhad the pastor of the day and I told you\nyesterday that I had known that Pastor\nmy entire life well the pastor today I\nhave not known very long\num probably have only spoken to him\nmaybe about two hours my entire life now\nwhy in the world would I bring somebody\nup here to be the pastor of the day that\nI haven't known very long\nwell whether you're up in the top of the\ngallery today or whether you're in the\nSenate chamber there was a great\nFrenchman who came over to America wrote\nthis big book called democracy and in\nthat book he said the government the\npeople are going to get the government\nthey deserve and if they don't get\ninvolved in it they don't deserve very\nmuch\nand this pastor of the day has been\ninvolved in government for a long time\nnearly 30 years I believe\nas a Chaplain to Sheriff's officers in\nthe Sheriff's Department\nand they we know they go through a lot\nof difficulties in their role they need\na shoulder to lean on and that's been\nhis role he is also the pastor of\nMemorial Baptist Tabernacle in Walker\nCounty and you know he's got his two\nsons with him when I first met him at\nthe capitol or I'm sorry he's got his\none son and his friend is always\nbringing a young person along to the\nCapitol because I believe he feels in\nhis heart that they're going to get the\ngovernment they deserve and he's\nencouraging them to get involved in it\nso that's why I've invited him to be the\npastor of the day today this is Pastor\nTim Owens\ngood morning\nMr President\nSenator Moore thank you so much for the\ninvitation to be here today it is an\nhonor to be back and uh I want to let\nyou know from our folks back at Memorial\nBaptist in Rossville Georgia they send\ntheir greetings and their prayers to you\nand I'm privileged to serve the Walker\nCounty Sheriff's department and we've\ngot the finest sheriff in the state of\nGeorgia and staff and they send their\nprayers to each one of you and I know\nI'd just have a few minutes this morning\nabout it I'd like to take just a few\nminutes to encourage you this morning\nand thank you for the work that you do\num\nmany people don't realize the sacrifice\nthat you all make the uh the challenges\nand the struggles that you deal with and\nI want to read a chapter or a little bit\nof scripture here for you this morning\nand the back story of it is that the\nPharisees were coming to Jesus and they\nwere trying to trick him with some\ninformation about the law so they came\nto Jesus and this is in Matthew chapter\n22 verse 36 it says Master which is the\ngreatest commandment in the law and\nJesus said unto him thou shall love the\nLord thy God with all thy heart and with\nall thy soul and with all thy mind\nthis is the first and great commandment\nand the second is like unto it thou\nshall love thy neighbor as thyself on\nthese two Commandments hang all the law\nand the prophets\nand this right here they were trying to\ntrick Jesus by saying with all the Ten\nCommandments that you've given and then\nthe Pharisees had come up with over 600\nother Commandments they were trying to\ntrick him into saying what are the\ngreatest commandment and Jesus surprised\nthem with his statement that the two\ngreatest Commandments are to love the\nLord with all of our heart and to love\nour neighbor as ourselves and for all of\nus today I want to encourage us to love\nthe Lord with all of our heart with all\nof our mind and with all of our soul and\nbasically what that means is we're to\nlove God with every fiber of our being\nand for many people that's fairly easy\nto do it's the second part that seems to\nget us in trouble A lot of times we live\nin a country that's divided we live in a\ntime that's more divided than probably\nmany of us have ever seen\nbut in this passage of scripture Jesus\ntells us that we're to love our\nneighbors as ourself and most of us in\nhere\nwe love ourselves we take care of\nourselves\nand in a deliberative body like the\nSenate it's very easy to get divided\nit's very easy to argue and fuss but\nwhen we look at each other and realize\nthat not only are we human beings but we\nevery one of us in here were created in\nthe image of almighty God\nand when we learn to start to love\npeople\nI believe it's hard to love God if you\ndon't love your neighbor\nit's easy to love your neighbor when you\nlove God\nnow in the day and times that we live in\nI'll be honest with you I get frustrated\nsometimes because I think I'm just a\ncitizen what can I do to stop the Divide\nwhat can I do Jesus tells us right here\nthat we can love each other\nwhat I do with the sheriff's department\nwhat I do at the church being senior\npastor of the church my favorite title\nof the church is Chief servant and\nthat's that's why I am with the\nSheriff's Department\nbut what can I do\nto help change the country that we live\nin to help change the divide in the\nstate that we have\nI can love other people\nif I love you\nthe way God loves me\nif I can love you regardless of what our\nideology is regardless if you're\nRepublican or Democrat\nwe can still get along\nwe can\nhave challenges we can debate but at the\nend of the day when we look at each\nother that every single one of us was\nmade and created in the wonderful image\nof God\nmy job\nis to love the people around me\nI know\nas a pastor my what God's called me to\ndo what God's called you to do have some\nsimilarities of course I know none of\nyou have ever been called names in the\nPress none of you have ever had anybody\nlie about you nobody's ever said bad\nthings about you I'm sure that's just\npastors that that happens to\nbut we can love people matter of fact\nthe Bible says in Matthew Chapter 5 you\nhave heard that it has been said thou\nshall love thy neighbor and hate thine\nenemy but I say unto you love your\nenemies bless them that curse you do\ngood to them that hate you and pray for\nthem which despitefully use you and\nprosecute you that ye may be the\nchildren of your father which is in\nheaven for he maketh his son to rise on\nthe evil and on the good and sendeth\nReign on the just and the unjust\nthis morning I want to encourage you to\nlove your neighbor and here's the way I\nthink it works\nwhen we as individual people begin to\nlove other people like God who's loved\nus when we love other people like God\nhas not only loved us but challenge us\nto love each other\nif we do it\nand we encourage others to do it could\nyou imagine coming here today if I could\nencourage each one of you to love your\nneighbor\nthen all of a sudden change happens and\nthen it goes from this body\nto Across the capital to the house it\nleaves here it goes to the citizenry God\nnever intended for us to be divided in\nhateful but he said that we're to love\neach other\nI want you all to know this morning that\nI love you I pray for you I've got a\ndirectory that I pray for each one of\nyou every week and I want to let you\nknow that I'm available at any time if\nyou need somebody to talk to you need\nsomebody to pray with you your family's\nstruggling with something I'm always\navailable but I want to encourage you to\nlove each other\nlet the change happen here and spread\neverywhere else may I pray with you\nfather I thank you Lord for today Lord I\nThank you Lord for this body Lord I\nThank you Lord for the important work\nthat they do and father I pray that you\nwill bless them that you will bless\ntheir families Lord I pray that you'll\ngive each one of them Godly wisdom to\nknow to do right\nregardless of the political cost father\nto do right Lord I pray that you'll give\nthem protection you'll protect every\nmember of their staff their family and\nLord I just ask that you'll watch over\nthen Lord help us to learn how to love\nour neighbors like we should Lord help\nus to debate but to love like you have\nloved us and the difference of that\nwe'll make will go for Generations Lord\nI Thank you for each one in this\nbuilding thank you so much in Jesus name\nwe pray amen\nif we could get to the door Keepers to\nclose the chamber and get all our\nSenators in here and take their seats I\ngreatly appreciate it\nif I could get everybody's attention\nreal quick I get everybody's attention\nreal quick please\nwe got a a special guest with us here\ntoday somebody that I know uh most\npeople who've been here a little while\nare very familiar with we have our\nformer president of this body uh uh the\nThe Honorable Casey Cagle here with us\ntoday Casey stand up take a stand up\nright here thank you very much\nI wanted to have Casey down to have\nlunch and everything and it was kind of\nfunny he got up he got up here he stood\naround and looked he said Yep looks\nabout the same yeah I said hadn't\nchanged much I promise you different\nfaces same same song and dance but you\nknow Casey was always a great mentor to\nmyself as well as a lot of people in\nthis room uh he served in this body uh I\nbelieve 10 years as a senator at 12\nyears as a state senator from Hall\nCounty and then served 14 is it 14 years\n12 12 is a state senator I mean as a\nlieutenant governor as well and uh and\nhe's somebody that I've always since the\nbeing elected he's somebody I've I've\nreached out to called on to ask for\nadvice and and things of that nature and\nguidance and he's been he's been a great\nfriend been a great mentor been a a good\nperson to lean on and and I just wanted\nto uh have him down today uh and have\nhave lunch with him but I also wanted\nhim to come back into the body and\naddress everyone here and also wanted us\nto show our appreciation for his 24\nyears of service uh to this to this\nstate and to this body as well so uh so\nright at this moment I'd like to yield\nthe floor to our my good friend Casey\nCagle\nwow well\nthank you all very very much and\nobviously to Mr President thank you for\nthe invitation\num\ntime for convening haven't arrived the\nSenate will come to order\n[Laughter]\nI've been away for a good while but some\nthings never change uh which is which is\ngood uh but it's great to be with you\ntoday I appreciate the good work that\nall of you have done this session I know\nthat we're getting close to the end and\neveryone's excited about that but I'm\nparticularly proud of the lieutenant\ngovernor as well as the governor and the\nnew speaker and just in general the good\nwork that you guys have done I I will\nreport to you however that there is life\nafter politics and it's pretty doggone\ngood uh Nita and I uh we have eight\nlittle grandbabies now they're all seven\nand under and we have plenty to keep us\nbusy I built a little river cabin up in\nHazel North Carolina and we get to make\na lot of great memories up there and\nthis life outside of Politics As I said\nhas been very very good but it's good to\nbe with each of you I don't have really\nany words of wisdom but I would just\nreflect for a moment as the lieutenant\ngovernor articulated 24 years in public\nlife and that's an awful long time 12 of\nthose as a state senator 12 as\nlieutenant governor but when I came in\nin 1994 this body was controlled by\ndemocrats and I was a republican the\nfirst Republican state senator from Hall\nCounty and obviously later the first\nRepublican lieutenant governor in\nGeorgia's history but I was trained by\ndemocrats back then\nand you had to work across the aisle in\norder to get anything done and I think\nthat that is what is so beautiful about\nthis August body of the Senate is that\nwe are the deliberative body and the\nbody that it takes four house members to\nmake to do the work of one state senator\nyou know uh and don't uh don't don't\nstop reminding him of that but it's it's\njust been a great honor to have served\nin this body and to be a part of it for\nas long as I have and to see the great\nthings that have happened in our great\nstate the number one state to do\nbusiness in economically and so many\nGreat accomplishments and I know that\nwe're in good hands with each of you and\nI am proud and thankful for the\nfriendships that I have made in this\nbody and I encourage you to continue to\nact justly walk humbly and love Mercy\nthank you all very very much\nforeign\nsecretary asked if Casey wanted to do\nthe honors of adjournment resolution so\nall those in favor\ndon't come on down here and shake his\nhand and thank him for his time with\nservice

to personal\nan asset like land\nif you ever get down on life get a\nhaircut if a haircut doesn't make you\nfeel better go buy a new pair of boots\nif a new pair of boots doesn't do the\ntrick go buy

but you'll just end up with a\npretty piece of junk\nalways try to help young people as you\nget older whatever you do good or bad to\na young person they'll never forget it\nthe only way and I mean the only way one\nman can be better than another man is to\noutwork him if you ever have to borrow\nsomething from someone more than once\nyou need to own what it is whatever it\nis you're borrowing yourself invest in\nirrigation and finally don't ever get in\ntoo deep with a banker you want to be\nable to make your own business decisions\nand if you're in too deep with a banker\nthey'll be

chairman that\ncompletes the order Mr President\nI recognize the pro tem to speak to the\nresolution\ngood morning colleagues it's still this\nmorning and thank you Mr President for\nrecognizing me\nthis resolution Senate resolution 334 is\na product of the\nmember out of state travel memo that was\nreleased March the 1st of this year\nprior to my service to you as Pro tem a\nstudy committee trip to Europe was\nconducted where senate members use\nSenate administrative funds for travel\nexpenses associated with a study\ncommittee\nupon being elected Pro tem and thank you\nfor that I became aware of this trip\nthrough multiple media inquiries to our\noffice regarding the purpose of the\nstudy committee the cost of the trip and\nhow the trip was funded\nin cooperation with the secretary of the\nSenate and the lieutenant governor and\nhis good staff a thorough overview of\nthe Senate rules associated with\nout-of-state travel prompted me to\nintroduce this resolution to clarify and\nstrengthen the Senate's policy on\nout-of-state travel for members and\nstaff at the expense of the senate or\nfor the use of Senate funds\nthis resolution really does three things\nfirst of all at amends Senate rule 1-2.4\nand in essence states that neither the\npresident of the Senate nor members\nthose of us in the Senate shall engage\nin any travel outside the United States\nat the expense of the Senate\nadditionally as part of that same change\nin rule 1-2.4\nit also provides that no member of the\nSenate shall engage and travel outside\nof Georgia but within the United States\nat the expense of Senate funds unless\nsuch travel has been approved in writing\nby the committee on administrative\naffairs\nsecondly a different rule well same real\nnumber but a different approach rule\n1-2.4\nalso provides that neither the president\nof the Senate nor any other members of\nthe Senate\nwho are in their final six months of\nterm of office May travel outside the\nstate of Georgia at the expense of this\nSenate\nand third and finally real Dash 1-3.2\nprovides that no Senate staff members\nshall engage in any travel outside the\nUnited States at the expense of the\nSenate and it also has the corollary\nwith regard to our staff members and\nprovides that no member of the Senate\nshall engage in any travel outside of\nGeorgia but within the states at the\nexpense of the Senate again unless that\ntravel is approved in writing by the\ncommittee on administrative affairs\nit is imperative that tax dollars be\nused to further the work of this body\nas we work for the taxpayers these\nSenate funds allow us to better the\nlives of Georgians produce good\nlegislation and operate efficiently\nas long as I'm privileged to serve in\nthis position I will work to ensure that\ntaxpayer dollars are used effectively in\nthis chamber and that all funds for\ntravel are tied to a specific\nlegislative purpose\nnow let me be clear I do not want and it\nis not the intent of the president of\nthis Senate nor the rules that we\noperate under to dissuade our members\nand staff from being and going and\nlearning from our colleagues across the\nstate lines or for that matter across\nthe pond as Georgia's success is the\nnumber one state in which to do business\nis deeply tied to the international\neconomy\nbut the funds that we use for\nlegislative operations belong to the\npeople of Georgia\nand they are counting on us to make a\ndifference during our service to this\nstate in their lives\ncolleagues I appreciate the bipartisan\ninput and support that I have received\nin crafting this resolution and it is my\nhope that we can all take pride in what\nwe're doing here today\nand we want to further emphasize my\nappreciation to the president of the\nSenate and his staff for the great work\nthat he did in cooperating with the pro\ntems office in crafting this rule change\nand fashioning the policy that we need\nto operate under going forward and\nmaking sure that we've got guard rails\nthat the members ensure that we operate\nwithin those guard rails as we travel\nforward in our service of the great\npeople of Georgia I hope that these new\nSenate rules provide Clarity to help the\nSenate reach a new standard of service\nfor the people that we represent back\nhome that we call our beloved\nconstituents\nwith that Mr President I'm happy to\nanswer questions or I'll be happy to\nyield the well you have no questions\nSenator thank you I urge your support\nand I appreciate all the good work that\nso many of you have

this nation and so\nnot only are doctors now being put at\nJeopardy but also our children still\nstand at risk I understand the\ncompassion that senator from the 13th\nhas for our youth we obviously disagree\nour children are at risk when they're\nnot given access to the hormone therapy\nthat they need in order to properly\nmanage their gender dysphoria and so\nagain I urge you all as an act of\ncompassion to to vote now thank you\nI will yield for questions\nsenator from the\nit's from the 36 we'd like to ask a\nquestion\nthank you Mr President to the senator do\nyou yield yes I do thank you um are you\nable to point out what changed the house\nmade and the bill\nso that we may uh fully understand\nwhat the new SB 140 has amended by the\nhouse contains yes thank you for that\nquestion so the line removed the\noriginal bill that the senator from the\n13th brought to us provided immunity to\ndoctors and medical personnel who\ncontinue to provide care to these\nchildren who need it and the house\nstripped that immunity which now\ntherefore opens medical personnel to\nlawsuits not just civilly but also\ncriminal\nliability if they were to prescribe\nhormone treatments for these youth or to\nassist in any type of surgeries thank\nyou for that further question yes\nthe the language in the bill also uh\ncalls for the Department to establish\nsanctions for violations of the code\nsection up to and including the\nrevocation of an institution's permit\nthat I believe applies to hospitals am I\ncorrect that is correct\nso that this bill isn't true contains a\nvery heavy\nhammering Rod against the against the\nmedical profession and against\ninstitutions that offer uh Health Care\nuh to our Georgia patients the senator\nknows of what she speaks that is correct\nthis is a very heavy hand that comes\nagainst the medical the medical industry\nfor for simply doing their job for\nliving into their oath of caring for\nthose who are in need of care\nand further question if you'll yield I\nwill yield the the list of organizations\nand groups that are child serving\norganizations uh is long uh including\nThe Academy of Pediatricians other\nmembers of the medical community and\nmedical organizations is it not true\nthat have come before the committee and\nthe process of this bill being\nconsidered\nin both Chambers and pleaded\nfor us to not take this Draconian step\nand send the message of marginalization\nand negativity to parents and their\nchildren who are addressing this trans\nissue that's correct and that is correct\nuh the members of the committee were\nprovided with a letter from a from 500\ndoctors\nrepresenting pediatric pediatricians and\nthose who are in the endocrinologists in\nthis state to express their strong\ndesire that we not pass this legislation\nin addition to that there have been\nhundreds of parents and Advocates and\nyouth who have come and asked and spoken\nout on behalf of themselves and on\nbehalf of others asking that parents\nhave the right to make this choice this\nmedical decision for their children in\nthe same way that we talk about parents\nrights for Education\nthese parents have asked quite strongly\nand firmly that they be allowed to have\nthe right to make medical decisions on\nbehalf of their youth\nthank you\nI will further yield for questions if\nthere are any there are a few questions\nhere Senator Senator from the 14th\nthank you Mr President Senator yield yes\nSenator is it not true that when this\nlegislation gets litigated in court that\nthe argument that the people challenging\nit are likely to be successful in making\nis that for decades in this country\ncourts have recognized the right for\nfamilies and parents to make the right\ndecisions for their own kids\nirrespective of what politicians want\nbecause of the fundamental\nconstitutional rights that they have to\ntheir own family's privacy is that not\ntrue a senator that is correct there are\nseveral instances already in which these\nbills have already been challenged and\nwe do know that ultimately this will be\nrendered unconstitutional and last\nquestion Senator if you would yield I\nwill yield thank you Senator is it also\nnot further true\nthat and not speaking of the folks in\nthis room and their intentions but some\nof the groups that push this type of\nlegislation is it not true that they\nmore or less specialize in finding\ndivisive cultural issues that fortify\none party's base and that as this body\nmoves through more and more of those\nissues in an attempt to satiate those\ngroups that they will have to look for\nmore and more cultural issues to depend\nupon to shore up their political base is\nthat not true the senator knows of what\nhe speaks and raises an important point\none of the things that I think is most\ngrossly discussing about the situation\nis that we are using children as pawns\nwe are using children to really push\npush forward work that it's under the\nguise of compassion and I do believe\nthat the sincerity of some of the\nmembers in this room but broadly\nspeaking this really is about us\nbullying children in order to score\npolitical points and and that to me is\nextraordinarily disheartening I\nunderstand that people fundamentally\nwant to protect children but when the\noverwhelming medical professionals have\ncome in and said this does not help\nchildren this harms children this\nincreases their likelihood of committing\nsuicide and yet you continue to push\nforward I'm clear it's no longer about\nchildren anymore it's about something\ndifferent than that thank you senator\nrecognize senator from the 53rd for a\nquestion\nwell the senator yelled yes to my good\nfriend from a Fifth Third is it not true\nthat Senate Bill 140 actually protects\ntrans kids from genital mutilation\nSenator it is not protect children who\nare experiencing gender dysphoria from\nreceiving the care that they need\nchildren who are experiencing gender\ngender dysphoria need particular care\nthat a medical professional can provide\nI think it's also really important that\nwe state that in the state of Georgia\nchildren are not receiving these types\nof surgeries and our largest contention\nour largest issue with this bill is\nwithholding drugs withholding hormone\ntherapy from youth who need this we've\nbeen very clear that providing puberty\nblockers access to puberty blockers\nwithout additional access to hormone\nreplacement therapy is actually harmful\nfor children and so you're in effect\nactually not even providing them with\nwith puberty blockers because they can\nonly be on them for a limited period of\ntime this conversation for me is\nfundamentally it is not about stopping\nsurgery surgeries are not happening in\nthis state this is about making sure\nthat children have access to hormone\ntherapy the hormone therapy that they\nneed hormone therapy that many adults\nsitting in this room right now are\nreceiving because we've aged into a\ncertain part of our our kind of our our\nour lifetime where we need additional uh\nwe need additional hormones right these\nare hormones that people in this room\nare using we are asking for access to\nhormones for these youth because they\nneed it because they're experiencing\ngender dysphoria because they look in\nthe mirror and they see reflected back\nto them an image that is not true to who\nthey are they see reflected back to an\nimage that calls on them to ask for help\nto ask for their parents to ask for\ndoctors and Physicians to give them\ninterventions in order for them to feel\nsafe and good in their own bodies this\nconversation is not about genital\nmutilation it is about access to\nhormones and our children deserve to\nhave access to the medical care that\nthey need in the same way that we give\nmedical care for other issues that\npeople are experiencing that's what this\nconversation is about and I think it's\nimportant that we be clear about this we\nare not fighting about genital\nmutilation we are fighting about\nmedication and we are fighting to make\nsure that children don't go on a black\nmarket and receive dirty and tainted\nhormones because we will not allow them\nto receive good and safe hormones in\nthis state in the same way that I can go\nand get good and safe hormones if I need\nthem children need access to that as\nwell\nsenator from the 26th\nsenator from 26 says weighed 7 from 28.\nyou have a question\nthank you Mr President Senator do you\nyield yes to the rules chairman thank\nyou um\nyou keep mentioning that the doctors one\nof the changes in the bills was doctors\nare now going to be held criminally\nresponsible can you point to that in the\nbill because I'm not seeing it right so\nif you remember that if you refer to the\nbill that we passed out of this body it\nexplicitly says that doctors will not be\nheld civilly or criminally liable so\nwhat the house did was that they\nstripped that language or rent out so\nit's now silent so by not providing\nimmunity to our doctors what we in\neffect do is open them up to these types\nof charges do you further yield\nabsolutely so the bill does not say that\nthey're criminally liable\nthe bill opens up the possibility for\nsomeone to be charged because it does\nnot extend immunity but still does not\nsay they're criminally liable is that\nyes or no that is correct the bill does\nnot say those words\nSenator Senator from the 26 you hit your\nbutton again he's you're still in the\nposture waving\nall right\nSenator you have no further questions\nwell that I will yell thank you Senator\nrecognize senator from the first speak\nto the bill\nthank you Mr President uh you know\nSenate Bill 140 is a very uh challenging\nbill it has been something that has been\nheavy on the hearts for everyone in this\nchamber uh I think we have struck a good\nbalance here I do take issue with the\ndifference in hormones in in adults who\nare over who are in this chamber or much\nolder than age 18 years old I certainly\nthink that no one in this chamber has\nany issues at all with hormone\nreplacement therapy from that standpoint\nbut what we're doing here is we're\npreventing minors\nunder 18 years old from having\nirreversible changes in their lives\nthese changes whether it's surgical\nwhich could be done and can be done here\nin the state of Georgia or whether it's\nhormone replacement therapy I.E\ntestosterone or estrogen those give\nirreversible changes to the minors or\nthe child's body that's something that\nas an adult as a parent\nthey many times won't help with that\nwe've had testimony here that suggests\nthat and I think that it's important for\nus to recognize that we're certainly not\ndenying that for any adults but it is\nfor minors for irreversible changes\nwhether it's surgery or hormones that's\nwhat we're preventing\nas with the changes that were done in\nCommittee in public health in the house\nside yes from an immunity standpoint\nthat portion was removed and it is\nsilent in there the Physicians were\nstill held civilly liable from a\nmalpractice standpoint and the question\nis should we be held as a physician\nshould we be excused from criminal or\ncivil conduct and I certainly have\nangst or I have challenges related to\nthat but I think that in the end I think\nthat from a criminal or civil standpoint\nwe should never be above the law by any\nmeans and I think that's a very\nimportant distinction I'll give you an\nexample uh with Michael Jackson and we\nthink we all may remember that his\ncardiologist who was taking care of him\nat the time as a as really as a primary\ncare physician allowed him to use\nanesthesia for sleep at night\nthat was not malpractice that was\nCriminal\nand indeed he was convicted and indeed\nhe served time for that I think he may\nstill be serving time for that that is\nwhat we're discussing when we're\nrelating to that Physicians should not\nbe above the law uh\nand by any means Mr President I would\nask for your favorable consideration\nrelating to this bill I think it does\nprotect minors from irreversible changes\nwhen it comes to hormones and when it\ncomes to surgery and I think it's the\nright thing to do thank you\nSenator has yielded\ncentered from the 42nd you wish to speak\nto the bill\nthank you Mr President I rise today\ncolleagues to State and explain my\nstrong opposition to this piece of\nlegislation I voted against it the first\ntime it was before us and it's probably\nnot a surprise that I will be voting\nagainst it this time\num my colleagues the center from the\n40th and center from the 41st spoke\neloquently about this legislation the\nfirst time we heard it and I believe the\nsenator from the 41st did so again for\nall of us who oppose this piece of\nlegislation that seeks to control\nparents and doctors\none of the issues that I have is that\nthe majority in this body is building a\nreputation for talking out of both sides\nof its mouth without any shame\non the one hand there's a lot of talk\nabout trusting parents to make the best\ndecisions for their children\nwhen it comes to all sorts of things\nwhat schools they can attend covid\nwhether or not they should wear masks\nwhat food they eat what camps they go to\nany other Myriad other medical decisions\nSchool curriculum what can be taught by\nteachers in schools what books may be\nappropriate to have in school libraries\nand the list goes on and on\nbut here we are usurping parents rights\non one particular issue a very private\nparticular issue a very private\nparticular medical issue\nthe body that has waded into all those\nthings that I just listed is now telling\nparents they don't have the right to\naccess medical care for their child this\nis the definition of hypocrisy\nthe rule does seem to be that we are for\nparental rights when those parents make\ndecisions we agree with\nand when we don't like the decisions\nthey make then we intend to Outlaw those\ndecisions\nas if taking away parents rights weren't\nenough\nSB 140 as amended prevents doctors from\ndoing their job according to\nProfessional Standards\nand threatening them\nwith criminal action or civil liability\nif they do so\nthese are the very doctors we rely on\nand Trust when facing our darkest\nmoments when our health is endangered\nthis bill\nin addition to usurping\nparental rights\nusurps doctors Professional Standards\nrequiring them to go against the\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics and the\nAmerican Psychological Association just\nto name two\nor face legal and reputational\nconsequences\nlisten Maybe under many or even most\ncircumstances\nit would be advisable for a young person\nin consultation with their parents and\ntheir doctor to wait before considering\nsurgery or or hormonal treatment perhaps\nthat perhaps that might be the case but\nit's undeniable that that is not true in\none hundred percent of the instances\nthat face parents and doctors across our\nstate it is undeniably true that there\nare circumstances for the more than 11\nmillion people here in Georgia where it\nactually is medically advisable to help\nthat child\nbe who they are\nand be able to continue their life here\nin this state\nin a way that engages them to it to to\ninteract authentically with their world\nand the problem with having a blunt\ninstrument like that is you leave no\nroom\nthere is no room left for those very\nsmall instances maybe it is only a few\nwhere it is 100 medically advisable and\nI dare say that almost every single\nperson in this chamber when faced with\nthe fact pattern that we know is out\nthere would say yes in this instance in\nthis one instance it is better to allow\nthe doctors and the parents to work with\nthis child and make this decision\nbut you're saying no\nbecause it's just vague it's vague well\nit's not a good idea maybe it's not most\nof the time but I guarantee you that I\ncould get up here with a fact pattern\nand you would say nope that's right in\nthis instance that was the right thing\nto do so shame on you\nfor inserting yourself\nso directly with that one family\nhope no one ever does that to you\nthis bill is addressing an issue that we\nonly barely are starting to understand\nwhich is another reason it's\ninappropriate to rush down here with a\nblunt instrument that treats all\nsituations the same when we know that\nthey are not\ngender identity of Youth with gender\ndysphoria\nneeds a lot more thoughtful study and\nlearning and less less arrogance and\nhubris\nright because otherwise all it shows us\nis that it all it is is a cultural issue\nbecause it's not a sincere attempt it's\nnot a sincere attempt to engage with any\nsort of actual understanding of gender\ndysphoria as it spans\nall different types of people there is\nno one-size-fits all y'all there just\nisn't so that does demonstrate the\ninsincerity of this bill\nbecause it demonstrates that really what\nwe're talking about is cultural changes\nthat make people uncomfortable and that\nthey just would prefer not to see\nso instead of studying the issue with an\nopen mind to listen and learn we're\nclosing doors creating far more problems\nthat reach beyond our base of knowledge\nand Authority\nthere are no Solutions on offer here\nfor any of it for any of the problems\nraised\njust a sledgehammer that smashes it a\nfew fragile youth\nshatters their parents and doctors\nefforts to engage in any kind of a\nconversation that could support them in\na thorough and authentic way and then\nsweep it all under the rug\nI urge you to vote against sb40 and to\nrecognize these parents these children\nand most importantly our own limitations\nthank you Mr President I'll take\nquestions if you have no questions thank\nyou Senators yield of the well senator\nfrom the night should we speak to the\nbill\nthank you\nthank you Mr President and I'm going to\nEcho some things that have already been\nsaid but I think some of these things\ncan't be said enough\nof course I am standing in opposition of\nthis bill\nyou know\nwe are\nat the end of the day we are picking on\nkids\nwe're targeting a vulnerable group of\nchildren\nI think is mean\nI think it's insensitive\nI think\nif we're going to pick on somebody let's\npick on some something some people are\non size\nI have plenty of Corporations we can go\nafter why trans kids every every time\nwhy trans kids why\nand I can't get a clear answer as to why\nother than we just can we just can't\nthis body just chooses to do it\nnot only that now we want to punish\ndoctors for doing\nwhat they are trained to do is to save\nlives is to give Medical Care\nmaybe it doesn't explicitly say\ncriminalize but we are talking about\nmaybe removing their licensing\npunishing them\nfor helping\nand trying to do the jobs that they have\nstudied their lifetimes to do\nwe continue to push the alternative\nnarratives this is based on political\nexpediency\nas stated by a member of our chamber on\ncrossover day you can't simultaneous\nsimultaneously have do two different\nthings be true\nlast session\nour chamber passed a bill enshrining\nparental rights over their children's\neducation and development\nI know I was sitting right here when it\nhappened\ntoday we're debating the rights\nappearance to protect to protect their\nchildren's mental health and their\nphysical wellness\nour Chambers has fought restrictions on\nfreedom of medical Choice throughout the\npandemic\nall we debated last year in the year\nbefore but we continue to take away the\nfreedom of medical professionals and\ncitizens to make choices about their\nhealth the health of their family the\nhealth of their children\nmake no mistake\nthese decisions are closely monitored\nand guided by medical professionals\nGuided by medical profession it's not\nlike kids are getting them off the\nstreets but you know now\nI don't know what'll happen if we pass\nthis legislation they might turn to\nmeans that are harmful but right now\nit's under the guidance of medical\nprofessionals\nand these aren't decisions that are\nreached off hand\nthey're not handing out\nyou know and and Advising just\noff-handed these people or medical\nprofessions they have studied they know\nwhat they're doing and we should leave\nit in their hands to do it\nand finally did we not prioritize Mental\nHealth Care last session\nbipartisan\nand there is no doubt around the data\nthat shows that even having this debate\nis damaging to children youth and even\nadults with gender dysphoria again we're\npicking on a vulnerable group of people\nfor political scoring points\nthe people that we're picking on on are\nthey have turned to self-harm before\nand suicides\nand it is directly associated with\nrestrictive laws just like this\nin our Chambers voting history shows\nthat our values do not align with this\nbill I mean I'm getting with Whiplash\nwhich one do you guys want parental\nrights or not\nto quote the senator from the 27th on\nMarch 6 2023\nI know all of us love our kids\nand I know that if we were asked all of\nyou if you were able to make the best\ndecision for your child\nevery one of you will say yes\nso let's trust\nthe rest of Georgia parents\nto do the same\nunless the side\nin this body let's stay consistent at\nleast\nin this body if it's parental rights\nlet's make sure we're upholding parental\nrights if that's what y'all believe\nand with that Mr President I will take\nChris questions do you have no questions\nSenator at yoga well Senators yield with\nWells I recognize senator from the six\nMr President I Rise to speak against the\nmotion and to plea with\nmy colleagues in this chamber that we\nfocus our time on critical issues that\nare impacting hard-working Georgians\nacross the state\nI want to start by sending my love and\nappreciation to all of the individuals\nwho have ensured that their voices\nwould be heard throughout this debate\nand\nsend my love and appreciation to those\nindividuals who are directly impacted by\nthis bill\nto the transgender Youth and to their\nfamilies\nI am sorry\nI am sorry that this body has failed you\nbecause if this body really wanted to do\nsomething to help transgender\nindividuals and their families\nwe'd be providing Mental Health\nResources\nwe'd be providing more resources\nto help these individuals\ninstead what this bill does is take away\ncritical resources at a critical time\nfor these people\nwhat this bill also does is that it\ntakes away\ncritical Focus\nand critical time that this body has to\naddress issues\nthat are important and that are\nimpacting everyday hard-working\nGeorgians each and every day\neducation\nHealth Care\nhousing jobs imagine if we had spent\nthe energy that has been spent on this\nbill\non the half million Georgians that don't\nhave insurance\nimagine if we had spent the time and\nenergy and the hours of backroom dealing\nand whipping\nthat was spent on this bill\non addressing the needs that we have in\nour rural communities and the\nInvestments that all of our communities\nneed\nacross the state\nand I've heard that there's some sort of\nmoral and religious imperative to help\nthese children\nbut if we had\nthat imperative and took it seriously\nthen there are over four hundred\nthousand children in Georgia living in\npoverty\nthat need our attention\nthere are over 8 000 children in foster\ncare that need our attention today\nthere are 60 percent of children in this\nstate that are not reading on grade\nlevel\nby the third grade that need our\nattention today\nbut instead\nwe spent\nhours\nand caucus positions\ndealing with a bill that does nothing\nmore than put lives\nof transgender children at risk\nI want to close by acknowledging the\nparents and families of these children\nbecause throughout this debate I didn't\nhear a lot of faith in parents\nI didn't hear a lot of trust in the\nability of parents to work with doctors\nto figure out what is best for their\nkids to figure out how to best meet\ntheir needs\nand to Echo\nwhat my colleague from the ninth\nmentioned\nI know that we all love our kids\nand I know that if I asked any of you\ndo you think that you would be\nthe one to make the best decision for\nyour child every single one of you would\nsay yes\nso I'm asking you\nto trust Georgia parents to do the same\nand vote no vote nay on this motion Mr\nPresident\nyou do have a couple questions Senator\nif you but you yield well yield the will\nas soon as yielded senator from the\nseventh\nthank you Mr President\nI rise today in opposition to Senate\nbill 140.\nrather than working to address our\naffordable housing crisis or fighting\nfor Working Families this bill seeks to\ndeny our transgender youth some of their\nmost Essential Health Care needs\nSB 140 would make it harder for parents\nto care for their children and make it\nhard for doctors to care for their\npatients physical and emotional needs\nany national survey one in five trans\nyouth said that they attempted suicide\nbut gender gender affirming Services\ncould cut that risk in half\ngender affirming care is life-saving\ncare\nprotecting children means protecting all\nof our children so I stand with the\npeople of Georgia urging that this\nchamber does not pass this bill\nwe must protect marginalized groups not\nembolden discrimination against our\nlgbtq community\nsome of the members across the aisle\nwant us to trust parents to dictate the\nbooks and lessons in our schools and yet\nthey refuse to trust parents to make\nmedical decisions\nbut it's not just our youth that this\nbill would hurt\nGeorgia has one of the highest maternal\nmortality rates and Georgia continues to\nfail our rural communities with our\ninability to recruit doctors\nand yet this bill would hold\nadministerably administratively liable\nthe very doctors we need the most\neven possibly causing them to lose their\nlicense\nthis bill is wrong\nand I urge my colleagues to live to\nGeorgia's\nmotto of values of wisdom Justice in\nmoderation and vote against this Bill\nthank you Mr President I yield a well\nSenator has yielded the well\nsenator from the 36 which rise\nthank you Mr President\ncolleagues I've shared with you the\nother morning from the well and points\nof personal privilege that one of my\nearly texts that I received uh by phone\nthat day that morning was from my pastor\nurging me to be a voice for the families\nacross Georgia and Across the Nation\nthat are moved to address\nsupporting their child\nwho's transitioning\nthe second text that stood out that\nmorning not much not much further than\nwhen my pastor's text arrived\nis from uh\na family dear friends longtime neighbors\nlive two blocks away\nuh\nour wonderful\nbackbone people in our community\nand the the proud parents of two\nchildren\nand my neighbor said please stand tall\non this issue please do anything you can\nto keep Senate Bill 140 from becoming\nthe law of the land\nuh and and she described how one of her\ntwo children her older child\nhas transitioned and is a female and how\nwhat a difference it made for them to be\nable to make their own decisions about\ntheir child's situation to be fully\nsupportive I want to stop and salute the\nfamilies\nwho say yes and affirm their children's\nself-knowledge when they come to their\nparent and say this is true for me\nI want to affirm those families that\nstand tall and I want to ask you\nin this chamber\nwe have heard from early on last year\nand again this year the very compelling\nstory\nof one of our\ncolleagues\nfrom DeKalb County\nthe senator from the 40th\nwho movingly\nshared her own story\nthe own personal story of the the\nJourney of her family\nas they moved into this space that they\nnever knew or what they were going to\nencounter\nand she has asked us to listen to\nthe honest findings the pathway that she\nand her child and her husband and her\nfamily have been on\nand she has given us a compelling story\nand I and I ask you can that not move\nyou from the abstract discussion of\nwhether you want to pile on with this\nbill that the GOP is pushing in States\nacross the country\nor do you want to listen\nto a dear colleague who contributes\nmightily who works hard every day who\ncomes down here and brings her total\nhonest self and stands up\nfor those who need an advocate at the at\nthe uh under the gold Dome\nand that colleague has asked you to\nlisten to her story as a parent\nare you really comfortable just\nclosing the door on that\nsomehow\ndiscrediting\nthat honest\nand compelling story that she shared now\nfor two years\nit's very personal that that makes it\nvery personal here\nand thankfully we've come to the point\nin the legislature it wasn't this way\nwhen I got here but we've come to the\npoint down here where members of\ndifferent communities are getting\nelected and bringing their voices that\nwere formerly never seen here people of\nMuslim faith people of immigrant\nbackgrounds uh\nlgbtq community members\nand parents\nof trans children\ntheir voices are here with us not\nsomewhere else not across the street not\njust in an article that you read or\nsomething on TV\nthese are our colleagues sharing their\nfamily stories\nsharing their life experience\nand I urge you open your hearts and\nlisten\nhow how can you how can you deny that\nfundamental truth that we've heard\ncoming from this well\nfrom our own colleague from the 40th\nDistrict elected and re-elected by her\nconstituents loved and admired and\ncherished for the work that she does\ndown here on behalf of those in need\ncan you hear that voice\ncan you understand this is a real person\na real family someone we know and\nrespect right here in our midst and the\nsame occurred on the over on the house\nside I would say as well when people\nshared their stories\nI was so struck\nby the contradiction that on one day\nSuicide Prevention Day occurred down\nhere at the Capitol\nI had constituents come down to have\nlost their own children to suicide and\nwho have stepped into that\nspace of being a voice and an advocate\nfor us doing everything we can to\nprevent suicide\nthe next day\nthe house did what they did on SB 40. SB\n140.\nwhen we know and the data is clear and\nthe statistics are there that trans\nyouth who are experience marginalization\nand being pushed to the side\nbeing bullied being taunted being\nmade to feel less than\nour very statistically\nsusceptible\nto suicide attempts\nso the stakes are high here folks\nthat this isn't just about another one\nanother bill that we're going to take a\nlook at and then we're going to cast our\nvote the stakes are high you are\nimpacting real families real people real\nchildren you're also you're also\nimpacting negatively\nthe Health Care community that provides\nservices\nneeded services\nfor transgendered youth\nso I ask you\nif are you comfortable with that is it\nyou're still going to vote your caucus\nposition\nthink twice\nthis is a vote you're going to live with\nthe rest of your life and when you go\nback to your District it won't be long\nmaybe a little bit maybe a few weeks\nmaybe next year maybe in Sunday school\nmaybe standing outside under the oak\ntree after church\nbut you are going to hear\nfrom families in your District\nwho gonna\nshare their pain with you\nthat this was the decision that you made\nthis was how you chose to vote\nwhen the data is clear\nand when as our colleague from the 42nd\npointed out there is much more to unfold\non this pathway of fully learning and\nunderstanding this dynamic in our\npopulation\nI urge you\nto reconsider supporting this bill you\nmay have voted in your caucus to support\nit\nit's the wrong thing to do\nyou're damaging real children\ndamaging real families\ninsulting the medical community in my\nopinion\nand Paving the way\nfor children who are denied access\nto medically necessary hormonal\ntreatment\nyou're Paving you're Paving the way\nfor incidents of suicide among our youth\nall of this is this is a very heavy\nheavy decision that you're making as you\ncast this vote and I would\nplead with you\nto think about it differently possibly\nthan you have thus far\nand again we have colleagues in our\nmidst\nwho can share reality with you if you're\nnot in touch with it thank you\nMr President and if the no questions\nI'll yield the well you do have a\nquestion Senator Senator from the 40th\nof course thank you Mr President um\nsenator\ntrue that even if you're a senator\nsitting in this body and you really do\nsincerely feel that you are helping and\nnot harming children that you still\nmight want to consider that\nyou're about to pass a law that is\nunconstitutional\nI think you make an excellent point\nsenator from the 40th uh and at Bedrock\nthat will take us into court battles\nthat have in other states\nprevailed in\nruling that this fails to meet uh\nconstitutional rights exactly and is it\nnot true that that will take use\nprecious tax dollars and that the\narguments would be such that these are\nsome of these surgeries are surgeries\nthat\nnon-transgender children also seek and\nthat you are singling out a particular\nset of people and saying that they\ncannot have access to surgeries that\nsome other\nminors do have access to which could be\na challenge under the 14th Amendment\nI believe the senator makes a very\ncompelling point\nand it just Escapes Me\nhow we think we can practice medicine we\nweren't elected to practice medicine\ngood people\nwe have\nsome of the finest medical schools in\nthe country right here in our state and\nincredible doctors and a health care\ninfrastructure that we need to get\nbehind and and uh\npush forward and fund and\nthis is not the approach that does that\nputting politicians\nin the doctor's office with a parent and\ntheir child do you further yields I do\nyield is it your understanding that\nthere could be unintended consequences\nto this bill and that we are not medical\nprofessionals but we are\nputting children in a situation where\nthey could end up having to be on\npuberty blockers longer than they should\nbe because they cannot make the\ntransition to hormone replacement\ntherapy and that perhaps we should take\na deeper look at this in order to\nprevent very real\num\nunintended consequences\num\nthat's a question yes I I I'm in\ncomplete agreement with the the senator\nfrom the 40th and that is a\nexactly an underlying point in this\nwhole bill debate is the damage that it\ndoes the damage that it does and it\naffects real people and one more\nquestion yes I yield uh is it not true\nthat\num I Heard very recently\num that out by the ropes\num that even our Georgia's attorney\ngeneral has said that this law is\nunconstitutional\nthat's very important to know and I'm\npleased that you shared that that's not\nsomething that I was aware of but\nit speaks volumes does it not yes it\ndoes thank you I have no more questions\nthank you so no more questions I'll\nyield a well\nyou did have you did have a question\nSenator but if you yielded you have that\nright too\ngood question\nsenator from the 53rd recognizable\nquestion my name is president with\ncinder yield I yield to the senator from\nthe 53rd Senator the people of the\nNorthwest are getting quite upset with\nsome of the things you're saying or can\nyou clarify for me do you believe that\ngenital mutilation is a necessary\nsurgery for Youth and minors I think\nthat you are using a a supercharged\nBanner\nwith a gentle lady or I'm sorry with the\ngeneral Senator I believe I believe that\nyou're using a supercharged term that\nhas been politicized and you're using it\ndeliberately to\nstir that up\nthis is not about genital mutilation\nthis is not about genital mutilation not\nat all well the senator further yield so\nmaybe you can explain that hopefully to\nyour constituents yes I'll yield to the\ngentleman when it comes to the\nconstitutionality of this wasn't it your\ncaucus that submitted legislation a\ncouple years ago that would ban\nelectroshock therapy for or any type of\nsurgery for those under 16 would that\nhave been constitutional\nlet me say to you that I don't at all\nrecall my caucus introducing a bills\nsuch as you described you there may be\nan individual member of this body here\nor across the hall that introduced\nlegislation referring to but no caucus\nuh that I'm in has taken that position\nor filed that bill\nthank you very much\nyou have one more questions\nuh Democratic leader\nwith the senator yield I do isn't it\ntrue Senator that we have a law against\nthe general mutilation\nyou're absolutely correct and it isn't\nalso true that I passed it\nthe the senator knows where she speaks\ncase closed\nthank you very much search your hearts\nsearch your hearts I attended a rally\nyesterday of\npeople from my church and uh other other\nFaith leaders uh met and spoke with many\nfamilies with the Trans kids\nmet and spoke with a trans kids who had\nbeen here and sought the ear of some of\nyou and felt that sometimes a rather\nchilly reception but it was a again\nanother eye-opening experience if you\ncan open your hearts open your eyes look\nat the facts uh there's a right way to\nvote on this bill and that is to not\nmove forward vote no on Senate Bill 140.\nthank you\nthe senator has yielded the whale\nrecognize the senator from the 42nd you\nwill speak\nI arise to make a motion\nMr President\nyes like to move that we table SB 140.\nthe senator has moved that\nthe Senate table Senate bill 140.\nunfortunately Senator that motion is not\ndebatable on this I believe you have a\nmotion that will that will be acceptable\nright now from coming from your\ncolleague right here senator from the\n14th thank you Mr President I moved to\nadjourn\nthe senator has moved to adjourn\nis their objection\nwe have an objection all those in favor\nof the motion to adjourn\nwill vote yay all those oppose we'll\nvote no\nsecretary will unlock the machine\nthis vote only requires a majority of\nthe of the quorum\na simple majority\nown the motion to adjourn the yeas are\n20 and the Nays are 31 so that motion\nhas failed\nSenator would you still like to speak\nokay so I recognize the senator from the\n14th to speak to the bill\nthank you Mr President\num I know the feeling\nof a quiet chamber in which the vote is\nbaked it is one of the most familiar\nfeelings in the house some of my fellow\nmembers can agree with me on that I know\nthe feeling of getting up to get orange\njuice or a milk or a soda because you\nknow that a long floor debate is coming\nbecause it's not going to change the\nresult because either there are caucus\npositions or we're tired of listening to\neach other I get it because I get tired\nof listening to colleagues when enough\ntime passes or I go to the ante room go\nto the bathroom crack a joke grab a soda\nbut I think today it is a particularly\nSalient feeling to be on the floor with\nempty seats because this result is\nalready baked\nand the reason is it's a metaphor\nfor silence the silence that trans kids\nhere when they say no this issue is not\ngoing away I do not just want to be an\nastronaut which is by the way a comment\nthat I heard indirectly and I don't\nremember who but there was a senator who\ntold somebody on the ropes that when\nthey were a kid they wanted to be an\nastronaut and compare that to this\nthis is not that\nI mean that's that's almost an offense I\nmean it is an offensive comparison\nbut the reason we don't know in this\nchamber that it's an offensive\ncomparison is because we're not in\ncommunity with those kids\nI'm not just talking about Republicans I\nmean Democrats too there are a couple\npeople in this room and you have heard\nfrom them who have the ability to speak\nto what it's like\nto be in community with trans children\nto actually listen to them and\nunderstand that this is not a phase\nthis is not something that is casual or\nor like a like a job that they want when\nthey grow up\nthis is their life this is who they are\nto say anything else is Erasure\nit's to say that those people don't\nexist do you understand that those are\nthe stakes for these kids\nthis isn't a colored bag that they\npicked to bring to school this is not\nsomething that they do to rebel against\ntheir parents\nthis is their entire life\nand that's why they take it that's why\nthey kill themselves\nwhen they don't get this care\nit's really that simple\nforeign\nWe come running back in because of a\nmotion to adjourn we're ready to show up\nwhen it's time to keep our grip on power\nbut we're not ready to show up when it's\ntime to let those messages in\nwhen it's time to listen to the people\nin the hallway do you know that the\npeople in the hallway Lobby me like I'm\na member of the majority\nthey act like I'm about to vote Yes on\nthis do you know why they act that way\nbecause I'm the only one who's listening\nto him\nat least in that moment they've got\nplenty of people to listen to this\nbuilding don't get me wrong and I don't\nwant to undersell the importance of the\npeople who have gone the ropes of both\nparties I acknowledge both parties have\ngone to the ropes there are Advocates\nwho listen to this this messaging every\nday but the truth is the reason that 90\nmillion of your colleagues just went to\nthe well to speak to an empty room it's\nnot that we want our media hits FR media\nhits\nit's because there's a message from\nthese children that is not getting\nthrough to this space\nit is being blocked and all of us are\nlike struggling to figure out how to get\nthat message into this room\nand we're not very good at it because\nthere's big doors right there\nand because we aren't Trans in this room\nI don't think we have a trans member\nso there's this barrier and we're doing\neverything we can to get the right\nmessaging to the people who make the\ndecisions but we're failing and today\nwe've failed\nand there and the caucus will the\nRepublican caucus will lock down and it\nwill vote Yes and this bill will pass\nand the governor will sign it and it\nwill be litigated\nand we will go back to our corners and\nkeep doing the same crap we always do\nwhen there is a divisive partisan\nculture War issue\nat issue and in the meantime kids will\ndie\nkids will commit suicide\nkids will feel that they're not being\nheard that their basic existence is\nbeing invalidated erased\nand the maybe the closest metaphor that\nany of us could possibly get close to to\nunderstand what that's like in a million\nyears\nis the silence on the senate floor when\nhalf the Senate is gone having a coffee\nbecause we already know the result thank\nyou Mr President yield the well\nSenator has yielded the well senator\nfrom the 34th\nwe'd like to speak senator\nsorry Mr President\nI rise in opposition of this bill but I\nwant to share\na story with you all\num\na few years back\nsome kids had asked me if they could\nmeet with me\nand of course I'm their Senator so of\ncourse I met with them\nand it was only five of them\nbut I was down in Fayette County\nand they attended\num Sandy Creek High School\nand I said so what can I help you with\nand they said\nwell\nwe need to\nbecome a club\nand the young lady who started she said\nand by the way I'm bi and I say it's a\npleasure to meet you bye\nturns out that wasn't her name\nthe kids educated me on that day\nthey were trying to start a club like\nthe other clubs at their school\nfor\nthe\ngingerbread anybody know anything about\nthe Gingerbread\nokay let me share with what I learned\nI told them I was not aware of all of\nwhat they were talking about even as\nadults I just was unaware and I'm not\nashamed to say I don't know everything\nbut they drew me a gingerbread to tell\nme the different types and I had never\nseen it and nobody had ever talked to me\nabout it so clueless but it was an\ninteresting conversation\nbut after listening to them\nI merely did what most of you would do\nand that was to reach out to the school\nand find out where the barriers are\nkeeping this group of kids from having\ntheir own club\nwhen I learned the rules of starting a\nclub at the school I got back with them\nand I shared with them the steps that it\nwould take you know they have to have a\nsponsor and they have to have all these\nthings to become a club and I'm assuming\nbecause this has been a few years back\nthat the club may still exist at Sandy\nCreek High School because of my\nintervention because all I wanted to do\nwas to have a Level Playing Field these\nwere kids kids who I had identified with\neach other they wanted to find a club\njust like all the other clubs at the\nschool\nand when they got one they were so happy\nthey thought I was the bomb they told me\nyou know I listened to them\nand worked on their behalf so that they\ncan have a club now\nthe bipart\nthey gave me the ginger red so I could\nlearn\nand being better aware\nwhy are we dictating\ninstead of listening and helping\nI'll tell you why\nI've been saying this for years\nI've been in this chamber more than 20\nyears\nand I know it's a joke of sort\nbut when I was growing up in Herndon\nhomes my brother got a chance to join\nthe boys club\nand I cried because my mother said you\ncan't join the boys club\neven though my mother's in heaven she'd\nbe proud to know that I'm now a member\nof the boys club\nsome of y'all get it but the rest of\ny'all tomorrow you may understand thank\nyou but at any rate I am here to say\nthat we consistently are attacking\nthings that are none of your business\nthese are our children\nif we make a bad decision look in your\nown self and see how many bad decisions\nyou've made\nbut by and large we can live with it\nbecause it's ours to make\nbut I'm gonna leave on this note\nI hope your districts are looking at all\nof this stuff you all are just pushing\nthrough because you have the numbers\nand I hope they're lining up to replace\nyou\nbecause I'm gonna give mine up so it's\nall good\nbut you all have got to start\nrepresenting all of Georgia particularly\nyour district and my question\nin leaving have you even spoken to your\nDistrict to get a consensus\non what it is there when we're all in\nthis together\nperiod\nwe are all elected and we are all human\nand we are all adults\nso I urge my colleagues\nto stop trying to legislate everything\nbecause you got the numbers\nbecause hopefully in the future when I'm\ngone we'll turn it back over\nlike\nformer lieutenant governor Casey Cagle\nwas talking about dims being in\ncontrolled and had the power when we get\nit back it's going to be another new day\nbut we're not going to be as\nmean-spirited as you all are I'll yield\nthe well\nSenators yielded well recognize

of the Senate on Public\nSafety recommends that this bill due\npass by substitute respectively\nsubmitted by Senator Albers of the 56th\ndistrict chairman reading till I say\nstop\nPublic Safety Committee offers the\nfollowing substitute to House Bill 120 a\nbill to be entitled and act amend code\nsection\n40-5-64 of the official code of Georgia\nannotate relating to limited driving\npermits

Bill 120 is\nan agency Bill to Simply make a couple\nof cleanups so if someone is past due on\nchild support this will allow them to\napply for a temporary permit as you can\nimagine while we find it terrible that\nanyone is behind their child payments\nwhat we don't want to do is give them no\nability to get to work in order to make\npayments on there and the courts have\nseveral ways in order to make sure that\nthat's taken care of also in relation to\nDUIs by error back in 2000 House Bill\n799\nremove the language that prohibited\nsomeone who is charged with either DUI\nor drugs from having the opportunity to\napply for reinstatement or a limited\ndriving permits this allows for that\nprocess to go back into order as it was\nin the past it's a very simple Bill a\ncleanup for our great men and women who\nwork in Department Driver Services there\nare no questions I'll yield the will\nyou have no questions Senator thank you\nrecognize senator from the 14th\nforeign\nthank you Mr President I promise we'll\nget out of here today in time for the\ncenter for the 50th child swim practice\nbut um\nthis is a funny one y'all because\nthis bill in its current form defeats\nitself\nuh it allows for limited driving permits\nfor folks who are out of compliance with\ntheir child support\nbut then if you look at line 76 or 78\nit says that if you're out of compliance\nwith your child support\nit's a mandatory revocation of that\nexact same limited driving permit\nwell that's a that's a problem so just\nflagging that for everybody it's going\nto put DDS in a really tough spot\nbecause you know they now they don't\nmake the decision right the the folks\nwho handle child support they're the\nones who make the decision about whether\nsomebody's driver's permit should be\nrescinded or not but what it basically\nmeans is at least for the next year\nwe're gonna have to worry about whether\nchild support is arbitrarily deciding\nwhen to revoke or Grant ldps it will not\nbe based in any way on the statute\nbecause the same condition\nwhich is being out of compliance will\ntrigger both the creation of the ldp and\nthe revocation of the ldp and it's\nmandatory now I'm pretty sure that\nDriver Services wants this that DHS\nwants this bill and that they want to\nshow some leniency so that the policy\npurpose can be achieved and I'm going to\nvote Yes because we want to allow people\nthis limited driving permit this has got\nto be fixed next year and I hope I can\ncount on my colleagues in the Senate to\nchange it what we'll hopefully do is put\nsomething in line uh 76-78 that says\nthat if you are not making a good faith\neffort to be in compliance with your\nchild support obligations then your ldp\ncan get taken away but right now the\nbill is uh\na little bit flawed that's all right we\nwe do that all the time so there are no\nquestions Mr President I yield the well\nyeah you have one question senator from\n33rd you just want to speak on you

small\nconstruction type businesses don't have\nthe staff to to go out and bid projects\nand of course now everything just costs\nso much so this uh causes problems for\nthem we've just changed the amount in\ntwo places uh that's what the bill does\nand I'll be glad to take any questions\nif there are any there are a few\nquestions here Senator Senator from the\n19th\nthank you Mr President

the state\nof Georgia except Marta can leverage\ncompetitively bid contracts from other\njurisdictions cities counties state\nagencies the MARTA Act only allows Marta\nto do federal and state contracts so\nMarta is unable to leverage City County\ncontracts for anything this amendment\nwould give them flexibility to do so so\nfor example if they wanted to contract\nwith the city of alpharetta's contract\non\ntheir Police Department to have their\npark and rides have police there to\nmonitor some of the stuff that's\nhappening in those parking rides they\ncould do that or if they wanted to a CID\nhas a landscaping contract they would be\nable to piggyback on that if they do a\nMarta Bus rapid transit station and have\nlandscaping around it so this just\nallows them to do what they can do on\nthe federal state level on the city and\ncounty level\nMr President I will yield the well if\nthere's no question you have no\nquestions Senator thank you\ndoes any other Senator wish

as\nprepared to present this today as I\nshould be but after hearing from the\nsenator from the 25th I realized that\nequality presentation does not stand in\nthe way of passage of a of a good bill\nso I hope you're going to support me on\nthis uh with a week presentation\nuh\nback uh decades ago I guess I think it\nwas during the Riles Administration\nthe legislature uh\nauto insurance companies were having\ntrouble getting their rate filings\napproved in a timely manner and the\nlegislature\napproved what we call a file and use on\npersonal auto insurance rates\nexcept for the minimum limits carriers\nhave some carriers don't even offer\nminimum limits so they're basically able\nto use the the file and use\nthe insurance commissioner has asked us\nto take another look at this we've seen\nsome skyrocketing auto insurance\npremiums from certain certain carriers\nand so this bill keeps the minimum limit\nrequirement the same as it as it has\nbeen but for coverages other than the\nminimum limits it basically is a file\nand wait to use and it gives the\ninsurance commissioner's office 60 days\nto review the filing\num\nand it clarifies that an insurer can\nfile everything of all their all their\nplans at the same time\nthis compromise will allows the\ninsurance commissioner to review all\nrate filings while\nstill guaranteeing speed to market for\nthe industry if there are any questions\nI yield the way I'll ask you favorable\nconsideration thank you\nSenator has yielded the well does any\nother Senator wish to speak for against\nthe measure\nchair

recommends that this bill due\npass respectively submitted by Senator\nWalker of the 20th district chairman\nthat completes the order Mr President\nrecognized as a senator from the 20th\nspeak to the bill\nthank you Mr President uh House Bill 222\nis a\nbill at the request of the insurance\nCommissioners to clean up Bill\nessentially section one of the bill\nmakes it clear that the practice that\nthat we've had for years where that uh\nservice contracts sold to Consumers are\nregulated by the insurance commissioner\nbut not service contracts sold to\ncommercial entities businesses Etc\nthat'd be like your an extended car\nwarranty\nthey've always interpreted the code\nsection that way it just makes it more\nclear section two\nif the insurance commissioner gets an\nagency agent application and given the\ncircumstances they want to give a\nprobationary license to the agent\nthe the current law they have to issue\ntwo consecutive 12-month\nprobationary licenses instead of a\ntwo-year probationary license this just\nallows them to issue a 24-month\nprobationary license\nSection 3 touches on a similar issue\nregarding agency licensing if an agent\napplies for a license and is turned down\nuh for\ncriminal history or anything in their\npast the only discretion the insurance\ncommissioner has now is they the\napplicant has to wait five years before\nthey can apply again\nuh in the case of a say a DUI or\nsomewhat uh an offense that has nothing\nto do with your fiduciary\nresponsibilities an insurance agent\nthere's no flexibility for the\ncommissioner to waive that five years\nthis bill would allow him to\nbased on the circumstances to allow them\nto reapply anywhere between one and five\nyears after refusal and then section\nfour is simply cleanup of language\nand current code that it actually\nreferences a code section that no longer\nexists\nthe it doesn't have anything to do\nanything substantive no substantive\nchange to Public Adjusters or the\ncurrent law regarding Public Adjusters\nso\nany questions uh you do have a question\nSenator Senator from 35th\nexcuse me what a gentleman with eel yes\nma'am senator\ndoes this uh\nI asked someone else this question and\nthey answer but I want to make sure it's\ntrue\na person that has already had a DUI\nand the judge said they lose their\nlicense forever\nwould they be able after five years or\nwhatever the time limit is to reapply\nfor a work\nuh driving license or temporary\nSenator this is dealing with agent\nlicensing\nto being licensed insurance agent it\ndoesn't have anything to do with the\ndriver's license\nokay so but the example I gave is if you\napplied for if you're a new\nwant to get a new insurance agent\nlicense to be able to legally sell\ninsurance in Georgia and you apply to\nthe commissioner for the license and you\nhave something in your background such\nas a DUI that might cause that to be\nturned down that application to be\nturned down currently they have to wait\nfive years to reapply this this would\ngive the commissioner flexibility on\nsituations similar to that to allow them\nto reapply within a year anywhere\nbetween one to five years okay I just\nwanted to make sure because I'm with\nMothers Against Drunk Driving and I know\nthat just like me others have lost their\nloved ones lives and they don't want\nthem to be able to get if the judge has\nruled already that they should lose\ntheir license they shouldn't be able to\nget them back yes so that's why I was\nasking yes ma'am thank you thank you\nyou have no questions all right
