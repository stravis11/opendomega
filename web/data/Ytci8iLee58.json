Uh I think I\nappreciate that. uh\nmy my reputation is is uh it's going\ngotten pretty widespread. I But it's an\nhonor for me today to to introduce an\nold friend of mine. I've known him for\nmany many years. Uh I don't go to his\nchurch, but we've interacted for for a\nlong time. And uh he's a very impressive\nuh preacher and community activist. And\nuh I'd also like to introduce his wife\nSusie who is uh probably more active in\nin our our county than uh than Don is,\nbut everywhere they go you see the two\nof them together. Don's the pastor of\nthe Oak Grove Church of Christ where\nhe's been for 23 years. I knew him\npreviously when he was the pastor of a a\nchurch in Fort Wentworth which is also\nin my district and is adjacent to uh to\nEffingham County.\nOne of the things I remember most, and\nwe were just talking about a little\nwhile ago, he uh he was the little\nleague football coach of my son that\nmost of you know, 42 years ago, and uh\nhe said he was he was glad that he\ndidn't ruin him, but he ended up being\nthe uh started one game and uh his\nfreshman year and and was the starting\nquarterback on our team for three years\nand we played for the state championship\nin the largest classification. So, I\nthink I owe I owe Don some appreciation,\nbut um the uh the Oak Grove Church of\nChrist, you know, everything in\nEffingham County generally is pretty\nhistorical is the oldest continuous\nmeeting church of Christ in the United\nStates. So, uh, just a brief brief\nhistory, but and he and his wife have\norganized what they call Effingham's\nHeroes, which is an organization that\nsupports all the public safety officers\nin the county. It's been going on for\nthree, four, five years now. People in\nthe judiciary,\nuh, law enforcement, uh, fire\ndepartments, EM, EM, uh, everybody\nbelongs to it. And, uh, last year we had\nthe inaugural parade in in Springfield.\nand I was fortunate enough to be named\nthe uh the grand marshal. So, I\nappreciate it. He uh he's moved up to\nEffingham County 23 years ago, but he's\nhe and his wife have woven uh themselves\ninto the fabric of our county and and we\nreally appreciate it. So, Don, thank you\nvery much.\n>> Thank you, Representative Hitchens.\nThank you so much. and thank you for the\nfriendship over the years. Thank you for\nthe introduction. I appreciate the\noffice of Speaker John Burns and this\nopportunity to to be here today. I'm\ndeeply honored to have this opportunity\nto stand before you today in this\ncapacity. And I sincerely thank each of\nyou for the work that you do for our\nstate.\nPhilippians chapter 2:es 3 and 4 is\nwhere we're going to read this morning.\nAnd it reads as follows. Do nothing out\nof selfish ambition or vain conceit.\nRather, in humility, value others above\nyourselves. Not looking to your own\ninterest, but each of you to the\ninterest of others.\nSelfish ambition\nfocuses on personal goals, often at the\nexpense of others. Vain conceit involves\nan exaggerated view of oneself and one's\nqualities leading to a lack of true\nawareness.\nNow, I remember as a young preacher on\noccasion when I allowed Satan to\ndominate my heart with these very traits\nthat we've just spoken of from that\nverse. Not proud of it. A congregation\nin our area where I lived at that time\ninvited a preacher to come and preach\nrevival services for them.\nWhen I heard who it was, I could not\nbelieve it. This man, as far as I was\nconcerned, had some real deep uh serious\ntheological issues and he needed to be\ntalked to. I decided what I would do. I\nwould go with my Bible and my pen and my\npaper and I would keep a record of\neverything he said that was wrong. I\nwould catch him and I would confront\nhim.\nI basically at that time didn't believe\nhe could teach me anything because of\nthe area of disagreement I had with him.\nSo I attended the revival as I had\nplanned, pen and paper in hand, and I\nwaited and I waited and I waited\nand I didn't have anything on my page.\nFinally, about halfway through the\nservice, the Holy Spirit convicted my\nheart about my selfish ambition and vain\nconceit, and I began to listen to this\nman speak that night from the book of\nHebrews.\nAnd I've never heard anyone teach like\nhe talked. He opened my heart to one\nbeautiful truth after another. And when\nI left the church that night, my paper\nwas full of ink.\nBut it wasn't of his errors. It was full\nof the truths that this man had taught\nme that night.\nI vowed to God that night as I had\nlearned a lesson that I would never\nagain approach a service or a teacher or\nanyone as I did that night. That from\nthen on I would listen to learn\nnot for something to disagree with. I\nwould not diminish or disrespect or\ndisregard the wisdom of someone just\nbecause there was an area of\ndisagreement somewhere in our lives. I\nwould look for reasons to respect and\nhear when someone was sincerely trying\nto talk to me.\nSusie and I appreciate this body so much\nand others that are here today.\nYou have a tremendous responsibility as\nyou attempt to serve the citizens of our\nstate. You have so many voices vying for\nyour attention.\nAnd we live in a time when everyone is\nencouraged to disrespect and disregard\nany ideas from anyone with whom there's\na disagreement.\nMay we remember the words of scripture\ntoday, applying them to our own hearts\nand our lives as we deal with others.\nAnd may we remember the words of\nscripture that encourage us to do unto\nothers\nas we would have them do unto us. In\nhumility, may we value others above\nourselves, not looking at our own\ninterest, but each of us to the interest\nof others. We will not always agree with\neveryone, but with this approach, we can\nbuild a spirit of mutual respect and\nappreciation and genuine consideration\neven in our disagreements.\nWould you stand with me, please, as we\npray this morning?\nAnd following the prayer, we will have\nthe pledge of allegiance. Precious\nFather,\nGod of all creation, we bow before you\nacknowledging that it is in you that we\nlive and move and have our being. We bow\nbefore you this morning, Lord, to first\nof all say thank you. Thank you for your\nlove, your mercy, and grace manifested\nin so many ways every day in our lives.\nThank you for Jesus, our Lord and\nSavior. And thank you for the blessing\nof living in America and the blessing of\nliving in the state of Georgia. Thank\nyou for those you've raised up to serve\nas leaders. Thank you for everyone from\nthe highest officials in our state to\nthose who serve in our local\ncommunities. Lord, today we continue to\ngrieve for the life of yours and our\nservant that was taken and mourn for his\nfamily. Please hold this family close to\nyour heart in this time of loss. We ask\nfor healing for your servant who was\ninjured and just please place a hedge of\nprotection around all of our first\nresponders.\nThank you for those who selfishly served\nour state over the weekend to make it\npossible for us to get out and about and\nto protect us from the dangers incurred\nby the weather. Lord, especially today,\nwill you bless with your presence, your\nwisdom, and guidance those of this\nchamber as they consider the important\nmatters before them. Open their minds\nfor the discernment needed to make not\njust good decisions, Father, but the\nbest decisions for the well-being of our\nstate now and the years to come. Thank\nyou for the work in progress that has\nbeen done. You've been so good to us,\nLord. Thank you for that which is\npresently being done in our state. We\nthank you for the blessings of\nopportunity this brings for families and\ncitizens across our state for the\nfuture. And now Lord, may the words of\nyour servant David and our savior Jesus\nwhen they said, \"Father, into your hands\nI commit my spirit be the sentiments of\nour own hearts today in everything for\nyour glory and honor and praise in Jesus\nname.\" Amen.\nI pledge allegiance to the flag of the\nUnited States of America and to the\nstand\nwith liberty and justice for all.\nLet me just get the doors open and we'll\nget some pictures.\nDoorke keepers will unlock the doors.\nMembers may meet the chaplain in the\nsouth anti room.\nChair recognizes Chairman Hilton, the\nchair of the committee on information\nand audits. Chairman Hilton.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Happy Girl Scout\nDay at the Capitol.

We'll\nmove on to the rules calendar.\nMove on to the rules calendar.\n>> Mr. Cler, will you read the caption to\nHouse Bill 350?\nHouse Bill 350 by Representative Cameron\nof the first and others to be entitled\nact to amend title 19. The official code\nof Georgia annotated relating domestic\nrelations so as to provide provisions\nrelative to safe places for newborns.\nThis bill I'm referred to committee on\npublic safety and homeland security.\nThat committee recommends that this bill\ndo pass.\nRepresentative Mike Cameron. You ready\nto go? Give the gentleman the well your\nattention, please. Representative\nCameron.\n>> Good morning, Mr. Speaker, and thank you\nfor the time. I bring today HP 350. This\nbill will allow the uh installation of\ninfant safety devices in the state of\nGeorgia. An infant safety device is\nsomething where like a fireh hall or a a\npolice station, an ambulance service or\neven a medical facility can place a uh\ndevice where a child can be surrendered\nand uh safely surrendered where uh\nsomeone will pick that up and and take\nthem uh to medical facility or somewhere\nelse. Um this is not a new concept in\nEurope for hundreds of years. They've\nhad uh devices called hatch hatches. And\nin Poland, they have something called\nthe window of life, which is a box that\nhas a window in the front of it. And\nwhen someone sees a baby, they tell the\npriest or they tell the nun or someone\nat a church, they go get the b the baby\nout. Now, how this process works is a\nnewborn can be surrendered at say a\nfireh hall. When they open the the front\ndoor of this device, they place the baby\ninside. It's like almost like an\nincubator. They close the box. An alarm\ngoes off silently inside the fireh hall.\nUh then someone comes, they out of the\nback side of the device, they take the\nthe newborn out. Then the process is to\ntake the newborn to a medical facility\nto be checked out, usually with EMS.\nWhen the\nchild gets to the hospital, they notify\nhuman services. They check the baby out\nand once the the baby is uh deemed to be\nsafe and okay, then within six hours,\nthe Department of Human Services picks\nthe baby up and places them in care.\nThat way, we get them in a safe place\nwhere they'll be there. Uh, one question\nthat's come up is what happens if say a\nfire department in a real community will\nuh right on a call and the alarm goes\noff. The bill uh states that that that\nalarm has to go off to someone else like\na EMS or 911 center so someone knows\nthat child is in there. So then someone\ncan come and and take the baby out.\nThere's also another alarm that monitors\nthe inside of the box all day long to to\nsee if there's any activity. Plus, the\nact also requires twice a day that uh\nfiremen or the police department,\nwhoever, goes in, monitors, and checks\nto see if everything's okay. Once a\nmonth, both alarms have to be checked\nand verified to make sure they work. So,\nit's a safe way if someone makes a\ndecision to surrender a child, they can\ndo it this way and know that there are\npeople there that are going to take care\nof the child and move the child through\na process of safety to get them\nsomewhere where maybe they can have a\nbetter life. So, that's the whole idea\nwhere we're not dropping babies in\ndiscriminant places, you know, those\nkind of things that's happened before.\nSo, Mr. Speaker, that's the bill in\ngeneral. I'll be glad to answer any\nquestions.\nGentleman yield for a question?\n>> Yes, sir.\n>> Representative Scoffield is recognized\nfor a question. Represent Scoffield to\nyour right.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does a gentleman\nyield?\n>> I yield.\n>> I just want to say that this is this not\na good bill?\n>> I believe it's a great bill. It's an\nopportunity to offer something to\nsomeone when they surrender a child. And\nI as a man I can't imagine the pain that\nwhen you come to that decision of\nsurrendering a child for whatever reason\nbut you know if it goes in here there's\na process and the child will be safe and\nit'll be taken care of.\n>> Does gentleman further yield?\n>> Yes ma'am.\n>> I look forward to voting yes on this\nbill. Can you expand that so that I can\nput legislator in the box like this one\nright over here and leave her somewhere?\nThank you. Mr. We had to change the age\nrequirement back to that.\n>> Gentleman further yield.\n>> Yes, sir.\n>> Representative Holly to your left\nback is recognized for a question.\n>> Good morning.\n>> Good morning and thank you, Mr. Speaker.\nUh, thank you for bringing this bill,\nsir. Uh, I was wondering u this I was\nbelieving when you reading through this\nit brought to mind of that case of\nJustin uh Ross Harris who intentionally\nunfortunately left his child uh in the\ncar. Uh and then but I think you know\ncertainly this bill looks at the fact\nthat fathers too might be able to be\nspared should their child be over under\nthe age of 30. uh is that true even\nthough the statute doesn't necessarily\nuh does not have specify in terms of the\nsex of the parent\n>> doesn't specify but I believe\n>> okay thank you sir I believe this is an\nexcellent bill thank you\n>> thank you\n>> representative Rice to your left is\nrecognized for a question\n>> thank you Mr. Speaker, do you yield?\n>> Yes, ma'am.\n>> Is it not true that in addition to\ngiving the the option of life to a\nmother that's potentially in a crisis\npregnancy, there's also what this\naffords is when a mother or father has a\nchild that might be in danger due to\nsubstance abuse or abuse in the home, it\ngives a safe alternative for that child\nto grow up safe in a happy life that\nthat that parent desires.\n>> You're exactly right. And I was thinking\nto mind last year we had two members who\nfamilies had babies. Those babies are\ngoing to be loved and and taken care of.\nBut for children that aren't, this gives\nan opportunity to get those children in\na position where they can find hopefully\na forever family. And I think of\nrepresentative Hud, former\nRepresentative Hutcherson that used to\nshow children on the screen that needed\nto be adopted. We find a place for a\nchild like that and where they'll be\nsafe and they'll be nurtured. So yes.\nThank you.\nRepresentative Glaze\nis recognized for a question. Your left\nagain.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. Is it not true\nthat the saving lives of babies is the\nprobably the most heavenly thing that we\ncan do in this session?\n>> Oh, I think so. And you know, one of\nthese children may grow up and end up in\nthis legislature. So, you never know.\nUm, we're giving we're giving children a\nchance to grow up and become everything\nthey can be. So,\n>> is it not also not true that as a mother\nand a grandmother, I stand firmly with\nthis bill and can't wait to vote it up.\n>> I know you do. Thank you for your help.\n>> Representative Hitchens, Chairman\nHitchens, recognized for a question to\nyour left again.\n>> Gentlemen, yield.\n>> Yes, sir. One of the concepts of this\nwhole program was to begin with was\nanonymity. Uh all those facilities that\nyou named off typically have uh video\ncamera security. Is there any guarantee\nthat they won't be videoed and then at a\nlater time identified in some fashion?\n>> Well, the statute says they can do it\nanonymously. If they wish to get their\nname, they can, but they don't have to.\nAnd uh what happened I live most people\nknow I live on the border of Tennessee.\nLike if I could hit a 60\u00b0ree wedge\nstraight, it would be probably 60 70 ft.\nYeah. But uh Chattanooga has one in a\nfireh hall and last March uh after we\ndiscussed this bill with the speaker um\nthat night a child was surrendered and\nsuccessfully taken to a medical\nfacility. Now that child's in a in a\nfamily, so it's a good process.\n>> Gentleman has no further questions. Did\nwe pass this bill last year? Is that\nwhat you said?\n>> We passed it as part of another bill\nwhich I want to thank Representative\nClark for doing that.\n>> But we perfected it.\n>> We have no further questions.\n>> Okay. Thank you. And thank you to\nRepresentative or Chairman Crow for your\nhelp on this. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I\nyield the well.\n>> Gentleman has yielded the well.\nIs there any objection to the previous\nquestion being ordered? Hearing none,\nthe previous question is ordered. Is any\nobjection to agreeing to the report of\nthe committee which was favorable to the\npassage of the bill? Hearing none, the\nreport of the committee is agreed to.\nShall this bill now pass? All in favor\nof the passage of the bill will vote\nyes. All those opposed will vote no. And\nMr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine?\nAll members voted.\nAll members voted.\nIf so,\nMr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On\nthe passage of House Bill 350, the yays\nare 168. The nays are zero. The bill\nhaving received the requisite\nconstitutional majority is therefore\npassed.\nCongratulations.\nmembers. Former Representative Angela\nCouch, where are you? There she is in\nthe back. Let's make her welcome.\nWelcome back to the people's house,\nRepresentative Couch.\nRepresentative\nBaker,\ncome back up if you don't mind.\nMembers, we have a couple other bills we\nwant to take up, but we want to we'd\nlike to recognize someone first.\nSo members, our doctor of the day today\nbelongs to one of our house members,\nuh, Senator, excuse me, Representative\nSylvia Wafer Baker.\nI demoted you to senator there for a\nsecond. And, um, you won't take that.\nYou going to stay with us. Uh, this is\nDr. Stiglets. We are we are so grateful\nfor you being here. Thank you for your\nservice. She's a doctor with the\nWellStar organization. We appreciate her\nservice. Thank you for being here to\nservice. Thank you very much. Let's give\nher a hand.\nI didn't say it then. She is her\ndaughter. Y'all thought she was her\nsister. I know that.\nHer daughter. I apologize. Thank you so\nmuch.\n>> Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to\nHouse Bill 946?\nHouse Bill 946 by Representative Clifton\nof the 131st and others be titled an act\nto amend title 27 of the official code\nof Georgia annotated relating to game\nand fish so as to authorize hunting and\ntrapping of feral hogs under certain\ncircumstances. This bill haven't been\nassigned to the committee on game, fish,\nand parks. That committee recommends\nthat this bill do pass.\nRepresentative Clifton is recognized to\npresent the bill.\nWe appreciate your work on this. It's an\nimportant issue. Ladies and gentlemen,\nif you'll give the member in the well\nyour attention, please.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I have here\nbefore you today House Bill 946, which\nwill provide hunters and land owners\nwith more tools to remove invasive,\ndestructive feral hogs from Georgia's\nlandscape. We already have several state\nprograms and initiatives working to\ntackle this problem, but we are as\nelected officials have the opportunity\nto remove statutory burdens currently in\nplace. I have worked with our team at\nDNR and have their support on these\nefforts. House Bill 946 would remove the\nfollowing burden barriers, therefore\nhelping to remove even more of these\ninvasive animals. Section one of the\nbill would allow residents and\nnon-residents to trap and kill feral\nhogs without a hunting or trapping\nlicense. As you can see up here, that's\na picture of a feral hog and one of\nthese invasive uh species we're trying\nto help diminish a little. Uh section\ntwo removes the wildlife control permit\nrelated to taking of any feral hogs. And\nfinally, section three does two things.\nFirst, it would legalize the hunting of\nhogs on private property from a motor\nvehicle without the need of someone to\nacquire a wildlife control permit from\nDNR. Currently, the law prohibits the\nferal the hunting of feral hogs from\nmotor vehicles unless a wildlife control\npermit has been issued. Second, it will\nallow the use of unmanned aircraft\nsystems or drones to locate feral hogs.\nWe're not killing them with drones.\nWe're just using them to locate and find\nthem. And based on the existent statute,\nit is currently unlawful to use an\naircraft to hunt feral hogs. The\nlanguage uh is included on line 47\nthrough 49 and would explicitly allow\nunmanned aircraft system used to locate\nferal hogs on private property.\nUh if you could go to the next picture,\nthat is a typical um area that hogs have\ngotten in and uh destroyed agriculture,\nwhich is another reason this bill is\nvery important. With that, Mr. Speaker,\nI will entertain any questions.\n>> You have a couple of questions. To your\nright, Representative Chaz Cannon is\nrecognized for a question.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the\ngentleman yield?\n>> Yes, sir. Is it not true that damage\noccurring on farms throughout Georgia\nfrom hogs is about $150 million\nannually?\n>> Yes, sir. That is correct.\n>> The gentleman further yield.\n>> Yes, sir.\n>> Is it not true that this is being done\nin on some places already, but this just\nfurther codifies it in the law?\n>> Yes, sir. That's correct.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker.\n>> Gentleman has a couple other questions.\nRep. Representative Thomas to your\nright. This is recognized for a\nquestion.\n>> Thank you. Do you yield?\n>> Yes, sir.\n>> I'm just curious. Is this any way going\nto affect the wild hog supper?\n>> We might have a little bit more uh\nbarbecue if we can get this thing\nthrough.\n>> Well, thank you. In that case, I'll\nsupport the bill.\n>> Thank you, sir.\n>> Chairman Petri to your left is\nrecognized for a question.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does gentleman\nyield?\n>> Yes, sir. Is it not true representative\nthat not only is this species invasive\nto the North American continent,\ndestructive of agriculture, but also of\nnative wildlife and native species such\nas quail nest, turkey nest, etc.\n>> Absolutely. And just to add, the feral\nhogs uh can reproduce, I believe, two\nsometimes three times a year and have um\na litter of piglets up to about 18. So\nonce hogs are in your area, it is almost\nimpossible to get rid of them. So again,\nthis measure is to help keep the\npopulation down so they do not destroy\nproperty and to your point, uh,\nwildlife.\n>> Representative Reese to your left in the\nback is recognized for a question.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the\ngentleman yield?\n>> Yes, sir. Isn't it true that these hogs\nare actually causing millions of dollars\nin damage to our farming industry here\nin Georgia and can damage acres just\nwithin a nighttime span?\n>> Yes, sir. As of 2020, UG uh extension um\nestimated about $150 million in damages.\nAnd\n>> and isn't it further true that many of\nour farmers in the rural parts of our\nstate just don't have the capacity to\nfence off their entire properties? But\nthese hogs are causing a huge issue as\nwell as the deer too that I'm hearing\nfrom some farmers. I know we're just\ndealing with hogs today, but the deer\nare also causing a major issue for our\nfarmers and and the pro products that\nthey yield.\n>> Yes, sir.\n>> Thank you.\n>> Chairman Dicki, he should know a little\nbit about this subject matter. Let's see\nwhat he knows. He has a question.\nChairman Dick,\n>> uh, does gentleman yell?\n>> Yes, sir. not only agricultural crops,\nbut I think it's known that they will uh\ndamage and um our sea turtle nests if\nthey're on the coast in those\nsituations. So, uh a very destructive\nanimal.\n>> Absolutely.\n>> Representative Ostein and then one more.\nRepresentative Ostein is recognized for\na question.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the\ngentleman yield?\n>> Yes, ma'am. Is it not true that my\nfamily farms many, many, many acres and\nthey destroy our family farm every\nsingle year?\n>> Yes, ma'am.\n>> Is it not true that it is costing us a\nfortune every year to get people to come\nand kill these things for us?\n>> Yes, ma'am.\n>> I look forward to supporting the bill.\nThank you so much.\n>> Thank you.\n>> To your left, Representative Donahoo is\nrecognized for a question.\n>> You, Mr. Speaker, is this not true? Does\na gentleman yield?\n>> Yes, sir. Is it not true that this will\nnot affect Wilbur, our friend in\nCharlotte's Web?\n>> This is for feral hogs only, not hogs\nthat are pets or farm raised.\n>> Thank you for bringing the bill. It's a\ngreat bill.\n>> Thank you.\n>> Gentleman has no further questions.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well\nand ask for your favorable\nconsideration.\nJust to follow up on Chairman Dickiy's\nquestion and that answer uh all of our\nfriends from the coast realize how\ndestructive these uh predators are on\nour sea turtle nest. Also island is one\nof our most prolific\nuh sea islands that um\nproduces as provides a spot for sea\nturtles to nest. And there is a there\nare a real problem y'all.\nIs there any objection to the previous\nquestion being ordered? Hearing none,\nthe previous question is ordered.\nIs there any objection to agreeing to\nthe report of the committee which was\nfavorable to the passage of the bill?\nHearing none, the report of the\ncommittee is agreed to. Shall this bill\nnow pass? All in favor of the passage of\nthe bill, we'll vote yes. All those\nopposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk,\nwill you unlock the machine?\nHave all members voted?\n>> All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk,\nwill you lock the machine\non the passage of House Bill 946?\nThe yays are 1663.\nThe nays are one. The bill having\nreceived the requisite constitutional\nmajority is therefore passed.\nMr. Cler, will you read the caption of\nHouse Bill 999?\nHouse Bill 9999 by Representative Lever\nto the 123rd and others to be entitled\nand act to amend article 5 of chapter 10\nof title 15 of the official code of\nGeorgia annotated relating the fees and\ncosts of magistrate courts so as to\nrevise provisions related to magistrate\ncourts collecting sums and fees\nauthorized by law. This bill referred to\nthe committee on judiciary that\ncommittee recommends this bill do pass.\nChairman Levit, who comes from where all\nthat granite is, is recognized to\npresent the bill. Chairman Libert.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and\ngentlemen of the House, uh, House Bill\n999 is one of these exciting high\nvoltage bills for which I have become\nknown to present to you. Um, it does two\nthings. It it impacts our magistrate\ncourts. First of all, it allows\nmagistrate courts to assess fees in\naddition to what they can collect by\nstatute if they're authorized by local\nlaw, by local act of the general\nassembly. A number of courts already do\nthat, but in the opinion of legislative\ncounsel, as one of my clients once said\nto me, you had a big rat rod, it ain't\nexactly le um so that is their opinion.\nI know a lot of us have it, but this\nbill would would fix it. Basically, it\nwould render that if as long as there's\na local act, it would render technology\nfees and that sort of thing legal. It\nwould also allow courts in the future to\ndo it. It this arose for me personally\nbecause one of my magistrate judges\nwanted to assess such a fee. Um, so it\nwould do that and I would I would keep\nin mind I know many of us don't like\nadditional fees, but this is a fee that\nthe court can assess and and basically\ncollect the revenue to fund their\ntechnology needs through the people who\nwere before the the court rather than uh\nput that burden on county taxpayers.\nSecond, the bill fixes a repealer\nuh from House Bill 426, Representative\nNews bill last year which passed this\nhouse that would make probate judges and\nmagistrate judges n nonpartisan\npositions. The issue is in that bill,\nprobate judges are constitutional\nofficers. So, making them nonpartisan\nhad to be approved or ratified at at a\nconstitutional referendum. There's a\nresolution, I think, currently uh\npending that that hopefully will reach\nthe floor at some point that would\nauthorize that referendum.\nproblem is in the bill it it normally it\nwhen we when we have a constitutional\nreferendum we put in the bill enacting\nsomething that's subject to a referendum\nrepealer language. So if the if the\nreferendum does not pass then whatever\nwe did in that bill is repealed. The\nproblem was with House Bill 426 there\nwas a little typo in there and it\nrepealed the whole thing. The part on\nmagistrate judges as well as the part on\nprobate judges if the referendum that\njust applied to probate judges didn't\npass. So we fixed that with this bill.\nWe're we're revising that act so that\nthe repealer applies only to the parts\nabout probate judges if the referendum\ndoes not pass. So, I hope you all were\nable to contain yourselves in that\nexciting presentation. Mr. Speaker, I'm\nhappy to stand for any questions.\n>> Yes. Um, if you'll yield, Representative\nJason Ridley and I have a question. I'm\ngoing to recognize Jason Ridley for the\nquestion though.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Uh, gentlemen,\nyield.\n>> Absolutely. this uh charge that's on\nhere. I know there was um a new program\nthey was trying to implement at some uh\ncourouses and then they was trying to do\nit all over the state and I know some\njudges came up here and talked to me\nabout that that they'd want to\nimplement. This don't have anything to\ndo with that.\n>> To my knowledge it does not. This is\nsimply about a technology fee within the\nmagist court system to keep\n>> I don't get nervous a lot but when a\nattorney tells me to my knowledge no I\nkind of have to question that.\nWell, I'll handle it the representative\nwould. Absolutely not.\n>> Oh, thank you, sir.\n>> I am absolutely positive. Anyone\ninvolved?\n>> My sentiment's exactly, Representative\nRidley. The gentleman has no further\nquestions.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and\ngentlemen of the House, I leave you with\nthis final thought. If I had a nickel\nfor every math exam I'd fail, I'd have\n$11.23 now. Thank you.\nI can't top that one.\n>> Is there any objection to the previous\nquestion being ordered? Hearing none,\nthe previous question is ordered. Is\nthere any objection to agreeing to the\nreport of the committee which was\nfavorable to the passage of the bill?\nHearing none, the report of the\ncommittee has agreed to. Shall this bill\nnow pass? All those in favor of the\npassage of the bill will vote yes. All\nthose opposed will vote no. And Mr.\nAlert. Will you unlock the machine?\nHave all members voted?\nAll members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk,\nwill you lock the machine?\nOn the passage of House Bill 999,\nthe yays are a 160, the nays are four.\nThe bill having received the requisite\nconstitutional majority is therefore\npassed.\nThat completes our rules calendar.\nWe have some afternoon orders. You will\nhave up to two minutes for your\nafternoon order. Up to two minutes.\nRepresentative Prince, Representative\nRichardson,\nand the entire Augusta delegation.\nChairman Prince,\nAugusta delegation, make your way down.\nIf gentleman will suspend just for a\nmoment.\n>> We got somebody up there. I don't see\n>> you have one more on the waist.\nGentlemen, hold up just for\nthe\n>> Thank you.\n>> recognized.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and thank you to\neveryone here. I hope you're going to\nenjoy uh wearing your your master's hat.\nThese have to be purchased a year in\nadvance because the course doesn't open\nuh other than M's week to those of us.\nBut Augusta is a lot more than uh than\njust uh the Medical College of Georgia\nand the Masters, but I will say those\nget us off to a good start and taking\ncare of a lot of the state. Want to\nthank you all for be for welcoming\nwhoever you see from Augusta Day as you\nsee them throughout the day. Really the\ngreater Augusta area includes Wesboro,\nuh Augusta and downtown Augusta there,\nMartinez, Evans, a lot of Columbia\nCounty, even McDuffy County. So we're\nexcited to to be here today. Hey, we're\nexcited to welcome them to the people's\nhouse. And I hope you enjoy the the\nlittle momento that we've left. Thank\ny'all.\n>> We'll try to be out by the time the\nmasters begins. What do you think?\n>> Bet we will be.\n>> Thank you. And we are proud to recognize\nand welcome all of the Augusta folks to\nthe capitol\nand thanks for all you do for our state\nfrom healthc care to entertainment,\nsports. It's um a lot of things good\ngood things going on in that area.\nRepresent Scoffield recognized for an\nafternoon order.\nHow about let's representative\nWilliams. I don't see Representative\nScoffield right now. Representative Al\nWilliams is recognized for an afternoon\norder.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I got closer\nbecause it's so cold in here right now.\nMy bones wasn't working.\nHint hint.\nI rise\nto mention a a a committee that I served\non this past year, the select insurance\ncommittee headed by Representative Matt\nReeves. It was a great committee. I\nthought it did great work and hats off\nto the chairman who I thought was very\nfair throughout the process.\nMy rising is very personal. We were told\nby one of the major insurance companies,\nthe largest\nin this country\nabout decreasing rates. We had no major\ncatastrophes last year in Georgia.\nAnd\nfor some reason,\nto my surprise, after being promised a\nrate increase, not personally, but\noverall,\nI got my bill a few days ago, and my\nbill went up $727\na year.\nThat's the exact reverse of what I\nthought. But in addition, from a\nnon-personal standpoint, there are too\nmany small businesses in Georgia,\nparticularly body shops\nthat are just mistreated by\nreimbursement rates by our insurance\ncompanies. When you get ready to fix a\ncar now and you might have just knocked\nthe tail light out, but it's so integral\nuntil if you affect any electronics, it\nbecomes a major job. And many times\nthese insurance companies will only\nreimburse the body shop 50% of the cost.\nNow I feel real sorry for these little\nbroke companies that only pay their\nbosses about $50 million a year. I my\nheart bleeds for them. But time out. We\ndid something about how they were\ntreating independent pharmacies in\nGeorgia a few years ago. It's time to\nlook into how they're treating\nindependent business people on ind on\nreimbursement rates. And ain't nothing\nwrong with getting old. So don't tell me\nyou raise my rate without telling me.\nIt's because I might limp a little bit.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker. With that, I\nyield the well.\n>> Thank you, uh, represent. Thanks to that\ncommittee and thanks for your service on\nthat committee. On that serious note, on\na not so serious note, Representative\nWilliams, you've heard of you've heard\nof global warming.\nWe're trying to make sure we can take\ncare of it. Gets hot in here. So, we\nturned the air conditioner down this\nmorning to take care of that. It's a\ntest. I think it's working well.\nRepresentative Scoffield.\n>> Okay.\nRepresentee Ali.\nGood afternoon, members of this house.\nMr. Speaker, thank you for the\nopportunity to continue the trai the\ntradition from my predecessor. Uh,\nplease give your attention to the screen\nwhere 13-year-old Riley is. Riley is\navailable for adoption, but she is more\nthan just that fact. She is kind. She's\na cheerleader, an athlete, a grade A\nstudent, and a true friend to those\naround her. And as you all know by now,\nit's my turn now.Hs.jah.gov\nis where you can make a difference in\nnot just Riley's life, but so many other\nchildren up available for adoption.\nThank you so much.\n>> Thank you, sir. Thanks for carrying on\nthe tradition. Representative Ford and\nRepresentative Howard recognized for an\nafternoon order.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker. Uh on behalf of\nthe Georgia Aggra Business Council,\nRepresentative Ford, myself would like\nto invite everyone to join us this\nafternoon at the freight depot in the\nblue room for a reception starting at\n5:00 and in the morning at 7:30 back at\nthe freight depot for our annual\nlegislative breakfast again uh for the\nGeorgia Aggra Business Council and you\nshould have this on your desk. Thank\nyou, Mr. Speaker.\n>> Appreciate what Aggra Business Council\ndoes. Join those folks, folks from all\nover Georgia.\nRep. Representative Acoy,\nRepresentative Gabe Acoy. He knows a\nlittle bit about a little bit about\nengineering. So, uh, give the gentleman\nyour attention, please. Representative.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Um, you\nintroduce it say stand up.\n>> Okay, hold on. On top of this. All\nright. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You\nactually introduced me correctly. He\nsays I know a little bit about\nengineering\na lot. But I am here to thank Mr.\nSpeaker cuz the other day I went to the\nuh restroom.\nI was shocked.\nLadies, I didn't go to yours, but I\nthink the speaker cannot be\ndiscriminating.
