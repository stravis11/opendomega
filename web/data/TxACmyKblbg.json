  "transcript": "We're going to go ahead and get started. Good morning. We're going to go ahead and get started. Everyone could grab a seat. Welcome to the second meeting of the foster care and adoption Senate study committee. I'm going to ask Senator Chuck Payne to open us in prayer. I'm the only one. I'm stuck with it. We thank you for all the blessings you have on us each and every day. Father, we don't overlook any blessing, but recognize every blessing as a gift to you. I'll be on your behalf. Thank you so much to you. You're welcome to say something to us. We're going to go through this guidance and the direction you would have us to go so that we can help those that are most vulnerable across our state. Now, we could make a better Georgia for them and their futures. We'll just ask you to be with us. morning. The bad news is we're missing several committee members who have various illnesses or relatives in the hospital or out of town commitments that they couldn't change. But the good news is all of this is live stream and archived and accessible on the Senate website and perpetuity. And so we can guarantee that all the committee members will be watching the presentations if they couldn't be here. We've got a couple of members on Zoom, Senator Robertson and Senator Hatchett, and we've got several presenters on Zoom. So we're thankful for the technology that allows us to do that. I also wanted to let you know that there's a sign-up sheet. I've already got communication from a lot of people who had already signed up to speak. And if you are here and want to speak, we will put you at the end. A promise will be done by three because I have a Zoom call at three that I can't miss. We also have a next meeting set up that's in Columbus on October 26th, and that one will be focused on adoption. And I also want to, and I can't give you the details on that yet that we'll send that out soon as far as where and what the format will be. I want to acknowledge Commissioner Brose and her staff. Y'all raise your hands if you're here from DHS, our partners. And also want to acknowledge Lieutenant Governor Jones staff where they go. There they are. Okay. And we've got Senate Press, Senate Research, and Legislative Council Representative here to help us with our committee report. And we've also got my administrative assistant Sky Park. And good news and bad news with Sky, too. She does a magnificent job, and I really appreciate all her help. Bad news is she's graduating from law school and moving on to greener pastures. I want to also acknowledge the juvenile court judges that are with us here. If you could raise your hands, thank you so much. It's very important that you're here and that your input is very valuable. There will be lunch for the committee and staff in room 328 when we break for lunch. I'm not exactly sure what time that will be. The speakers all know how much time they've been given to present. There will almost certainly be some questions from the committee. And so we'll try to stay pretty focused so that we can hear everyone's input, but also finish at the time that we had promised. And at this point, I'll let the committee members that are here introduce themselves. I'm Chuck Payne. I'm a chairman of science and technology and previously shared education in youth. I've 30 year state general probation officer before becoming a state senator. And there's just everything that we do for our kids. And the next generation has always been a passion of mine and will always be a passion of mine. And that's just an honor to be here today and get to hear the testimony. Thank you, Bob. Good morning. I'm Bob Bruder-Matson. I'm with Faithbridge Foster Care. We place kids in Foster Homes. We support the adoption process through the child life histories. We do adoptions. We have a system to train Foster and adoptive families called Faithbridge U. And we just started a new initiative that I'm really excited about called youth opportunities to support youth aging out of care and I'm very proud and honored to be here to serve. Bob, did you want to mention your- Yes, we have a really cool app. And if you go to seetheneed.org you can put your address in there wherever you are on the state of Georgia. And you're going to- we're using data that we've gotten from defects and an algorithm that we've developed that will tell you what the need is for foster parents, for children ages 0 to 5, 6 to 12 and 13 plus. And we use that to recruit and raise awareness about foster care and I encourage you to give it a try. Use it in your for your recruiting efforts and let me know what you think about it. Thank you. And we're also going to create a graphic from what you gave us on your card and we'll send that out with the presentations from today's meeting if anybody needs that. Okay, Dr. Constantine, what mic number are you 13? Good morning, everyone. I'm John Constantino. I'm a child now lessons psychiatrist and pediatrician. I came to Georgia a little over a year ago from Washington University in St. Louis and St. Louis Children's Hospital where I was directed of the division for 13 years there. And one of the really important arms of our work in public health and in science there was the care and support of children in foster care and particularly supporting successful reunifications for families. I was after that tour of duty I was asked and invited to come to take on the role of first system chief for behavior and mental health of children's health care of Atlanta. And I'm also a professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at Emory. Thank you. We have one committee member who's on her way. Julie Wazatski. She's an adoption lawyer from Athens and works extensively in the foster care system. So that's who is walking in here whenever she's able to get here. Okay, so we're going to start with two Zoom presentations. So Emily, do you want to pull up? Yes, I do. Okay, so I'd like to introduce Tammy Hill and Heather Wilson from the National Conference of State Legislatures. We're grateful to them for trying to get us some good information about ACEs, adverse childhood experiences and how they impact the foster care system. So with that, you guys are on and thank you very much for being here. Good morning and thank you, Chairman Kirkpatrick for inviting us. And for accommodating a virtual presentation today, I'm going to go ahead and try and share my screen and just confirm that everyone is able to see that. Yes, we've got it. Wonderful. Thank you. All right. Well, first and foremost, my name is Tammy Hill and I'm a project manager on the National Conference of State Legislature's Health team. I work primarily on maternal and child health and its intersection with mental and behavioral health. My specific portfolio portfolio does include adverse childhood experiences and child maltreatment prevention. Today, I am also joined by my colleague Heather Wilson, a senior policy specialist on NCSL's Children and Families team. And she helped to support policy areas pertaining to child well-being and will help to make this connection to foster care. For today's presentation, we'll provide a brief overview of adverse childhood experiences from here known as ACEs. And then Heather will help to draw the connection between ACEs and the foster care system before highlighting any potential prevention and policy considerations that we've been tracking throughout the United States. Before we get started, I do just want to take a minute to highlight who NCSL is and how we support state legislatures like yours. NCSL is the nation's leading bipartisan organization for all 7,386 legislators and over 30,000 staff. Our goal is to equip state legislatures with the tools they need to promote innovation, clear communication, and in Sharcohisa Voice and the Federal System. As your organization, we are also here to support with trusted policy research, connections to experts in any field, and tailored training for legislators and legislative staff. Before diving in, we do just want to note that any of the policy or state examples that we will reference today are purely for informational purposes and don't indicate NCSL support. As well, this is a complex policy issue and we'll be providing a very high level understanding, but we're happy to elaborate today or in follow-up inquiries. So ACEs comes from a 1995 to 1997 study put on by the Centers for Disease Control and Kaiser Permanente. It was the first of its kind and it asked more than 17,000 adults about childhood experiences. Specifically, the study wanted to understand the relationship between the extent of exposure to abuse or household dysfunction during childhood and multiple risk factors for several of the leading causes of death and adults. What they found in this study was that there was a strong relationship between the scope of exposure, possible household dysfunction, and the increased risk of chronic disease and behavioral challenges later in life. As you can see here, the study looked at abuse, including emotional, physical, and sexual, neglect both emotional and physical, and household challenges ranging from how a mother was treated to if there was substance use or misuse in a home, mental illness in the household, parental separation or divorce, and if family member had been incarcerated. Today, the ACEs questionnaire and study is still being used to understand and mitigate health complications later in life. Recent data indicates that at least 64% of adults experience at least one ACE with one in six adults reporting experiencing four or more. People who are black, Hispanic, or Latino, or multiracial, as well as people with less than a high school diploma or lower income than 15,000 a year may be have a greater experience for an increased exposure and a ratio to harmful health conditions. The better understand ACEs and how the effects can be on people and long term, we need to understand toxic stress. On the left side of the screen, you can see there's an image that highlights three kinds of stress we experience. Positive stress is classified as brief and mild, something that we all experience when perhaps taking a test or getting ready for an interview. Tolerable stress is serious, but it's temporary and it's generally buffering by supportive relationships. Well, toxic stress is the prolonged activation of the stress response system in the absence of protective support in relationships. Poxic stress is particularly dangerous because it can cause damage to the body and the brain. When this happens at a young age as ACEs study looked at, it can have lasting effects because this is a critical time for development. The accumulation of excessive stress in the body can interfere with the development of healthy neural, immune and hormonal systems and it can alter the expression of our DNA. Multiple ACEs over time, especially without adequate adult support, can affect the nervous and occurring in immune systems and it can have lasting effects on what potential, behavior, decision-making and response to stress throughout life. The lasting impacts of adversity early in life can affect adult's ability to live and thrive personally in both in a community. In a 2018 study, the economic cost of ACEs estimated a loss of close to $401 billion annually due to productivity of employees, the strain on healthcare, education, child welfare and correctional systems and states. Since the original study, the list of ACEs in various measures has expanded the goal of capturing diverse populations, data and particularly for children of color and people living in poverty. The ACEs questions for instance have been added to the national survey of children's health and they've incorporated familial death, neighborhood violence, economic hardship, unfair treatment based on race or ethnicity. Taking into consideration the ACE study and adverse community environment, as noted underneath the tree here, is where possible policy options and state actions can come into play. This is also where we can see an intersection with foster care and for that I will pause and pass it to my colleague Heather. Thank you Tammy and thank you to the committee for inviting us here today. I appreciate this opportunity to talk about the intersection between ACEs and foster care and really thank you for the work that you're doing on the committee to understand and improve the foster care and adoption systems in Georgia. A couple of high level notes is the experience of out of home placement is in and of itself an ACE. So 100% of kids going into foster care have at least one ACE. The reason for entry into out of home care which will go through some of the data shortly is typically associated with at least one additional ACE and oftentimes more than one additional ACE. More than 51% of children or more than half 51% of children in the child welfare system have had four or more ACEs compared to I think what Tammy shared earlier about one in six of the general population. And each of these ACEs that Tammy discussed earlier, no matter how many times you experience them, they still count as one ACE for your total ACE score. And so children in foster care may experience them multiple times or for a longer period of time. And that's what Tammy was describing when she went through toxic stress. Want to just end on both ACEs and child abuse and neglect are preventable. With that, like to dig into a little bit of the data. So what you're looking at here is the fiscal year 2021 data for the state of Georgia as well as the US national average. Fiscal year 2021 is the most recent national data release. So you may have seen more current data from your state agencies, but wanted to just list out those reasons for entries into foster care. So you can see the direct connection to the ACEs that Tammy mentioned earlier. And note that again, these categories are not mutually exclusive. So the percentages in both the Georgia column and the US average column will total to more than 100%. Also want to say that each of these reasons just to reiterate is in and of itself an adverse childhood experience. Give it next slide. So with that, I want to get into some of the chronic stress associated risks of foster care and being in out of home placement. Just sharing with you a little bit of the current placement setting. And so non-relative being that traditional foster care placement, relative placement being with kin or kin like or sometimes called fictive kin placements. And then a group home or an institution and other setting and that might be across state lines. So as we look at that data, looking at the number of placements by the length of time and care becomes important. So as we talked about the removal from your family or from that trusted relationship is an ACE. And so being removed and placed in new homes while not an additional ACE can cause additional stress and that stress can become more harmful the more times that happens. Breaking ties and bonds and separating attachment. We know in that secure attachment is important for children. So a recent report from KC Family Programs notes the importance of placement stability for children and youth. So child development research tells us that children need consistency, predictability and attachment to a caring adult to thrive. This is especially true for children and foster care who have experienced the trauma leading up to and including their removal from home as well as the trauma of ongoing separation from family. So children and out of home care need stable adult connections to support their well-being. ACEs are especially problematic for those children and foster care as a greater cumulative ACE exposure has been shown to dramatically increase that placement instability. So those placement moves that you're looking at there. But we know that placement stability has a positive impact on all three goals of the child protection agency. So safety, permanency and well-being. Next slide. So ACEs and their associated harms as I said earlier are preventable. State policy makers are considering actions and working with partners across sectors. So think faith-based sectors, business sectors, philanthropy, nonprofit sectors and community sectors to create and sustain stable, safe, nurturing relationships in environment for all children and families. Research shows that children do better when their parents do better. These policy considerations are research based from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's violence prevention teams. So some of them include strengthening economic supports to families and promoting social norms against violence. Ensuring a strong start for those that zero to three population where the rain, the brain is rapidly growing, enhancing parenting skills to promote child development, connecting youth to caring adults and activities and intervening to less and immediate and long-term harms. And that's where the foster care approach is, right? Children enter foster care to prevent that immediate or imminent risk of immediate harm. Next slide. So here are just a few examples. And I won't read through the details, but you have the links there so you can click through about specific policies directly related to ACEs that states have been considering in recent years. States are continuing to learn and understand the role of ACEs that can have on people and communities. In recent years, states have considered similar actions previously highlighted as well as expanding programs for health consultation, referral, coordination, pediatric patients, expanding the workforce by adding professions to mental and behavioral health supports for children and young adults, as well as enhancing resources and awareness in school settings. States are also considering the intersection of foster care in ACEs. And so looking at training all people involved in the system, as well as courts and really understanding the role of ACEs. Next slide. States are also looking into best interest placements and removal prevention decisions. So while states do not share a common definition of best interest of the child, to determine the best interest, some states require courts to consider the following factors. So safety and well-being of the child, the child's access to necessary treatment and care, the relational bonds present in a child's life and a parents ability to provide adequate resources. So according to the child welfare information, Gateway at least 22 states require courts to make decisions about the child's placement with the child's best interest in mind. And many states are addressing the importance of maintaining family bonds when considering the child's best interest and maintaining those family bonds through can-ship care placements. Next. So much of today's presentation can be boiled down into what research has shown us. Children do better when their parents do better. As you've seen, nearly two-thirds of all adults have experienced at least one ACE. Mitigating the impact of this trauma while preventing future trauma will take time, collaboration, and innovative partnerships, and comprehensive solutions. But prevention is possible. Next slide. Want to leave you today with a bunch of links to some NCSL resources that we put together over the past couple of years to help better understand ACEs and the intersection of ACEs and mental health and foster care and economic mobility. And so feel free to click through the links or next slide. I've also left you with the contact information for my colleague Tammy as well as my other colleagues on the Children and Families team. With that, I'd like to wrap up and thank you, chairperson for Patrick and the Georgia Senate Study Committee on foster care and adoption for this opportunity to present on the intersection between ACEs and foster care. And happy to answer any questions that you might have. Thank you very much Tammy and Heather. That was a great summary of ACEs and two things that I wanted to point out is that point that you made about making policy across sectors and getting the government working together with nonprofits in the faith community is something that we are very aware of and working actively on. And the other thing that you highlighted that has drawn some attention here in Georgia is the importance of the zero to three age range in this whole subject matter. So thank you very much and I'd be happy to entertain any questions from the committee. Dr. Constantine. Hi, Tammy and Heather, thanks so much. One quick question. Can you go back to your slide? Share your slide on ACEs are preventable. You have one slide that says ACEs are preventable. I just want to make a ask a quick question and a point about that. So while they're getting that slide. So the listing that you're going to see on this slide is essentially the ingredients of Safe Baby Corps and infantile their courts, the kinds of models that have shown success in reunifying families. And let's see, right. So when you go down the list from the strong start for children, prenatal care, early childhood home visitation, parenting training, connecting use to caring adults in terms of mentors and causes and so forth when they're in foster care and then family centered approaches for not only substance use but the mental health conditions of birth parents. And when those are attended to the successful reunification rates rise. We in St. Louis, we showed that it was five times the more successful or five times less likelihood of recurrence for abuse and neglect when those ingredients are introduced. And so my question is, is the the the the national conference of state legislature leaders thinking about the ensuring of these kinds of supports for families that will prevent subsequent occurrences of abuse or neglect. And and there's judges in the room today. And our experience has been that sometimes it's really hard for families to engage in these interventions or to, you know, to to convince families to, you know, hang on to these kinds of supports. And one of the great opportunities of the courts is to support families, encourage families who are in the process of reunification or preservation to to to do these things. And what we found was that when the courts were engaged in that and making those kind of recommendations, there was about 85% uptake of these kinds of interventions and it's and and and just as you know how they're in Tammy are showing, these these aces are preventable and recurrent abuse is preventable. So just the question of how the conference on state legislature sees the role of the court in helping to ensure that these get to birth parents in situations where children are either at risk for child welfare placement or in family preservation situations. And go ahead and start us off and thank you for your questions, Senator. So we've actually recently published on the Children and Families program, a family friendly courts briefing that looks at both child welfare court systems as well as eviction court systems. And so working closely with collaborative partners at the National Council for juvenile and family court judges as well as other other philanthropic partners and community partners to think through ways to support parents and families who are going through the court court process and making them more family friendly. We also have been working with legislators and through research requests that come in and through our publications to really connect these these dots that it is a comprehensive solution when looking at violence prevention in general, whatever that violence prevention might be in a personal or family violence, which many of the ACEs tie back to. So just appreciate your consideration of baby courts.\n\nNo, we worked with currently our child welfare and youth homelessness fellows at NTSL to discuss a baby courts in Tennessee a few months ago as well as in Denver last week. So we have been working on it and happy to send those resources your way. I don't know if Tammy have anything to add. Thank you, Heather and thank you, Dr. for the question. I think really just thinking about from the health perspective, this is a discussion that's coming up more and more. I think really for my end, it's more on the prevention aspects. So thinking on that upstream approach and to chairwoman Kirkpatrick's point, you know, really making those connections within the community. And that way we can strengthen referral systems and make sure that the appropriate system is supporting when they can and not trying to create anything too new. So really from health, I think it's trying to create those relationships, support as best we can, you know, if the health physical health mental health behavioral health aspects and then kind of transition into whatever system might be most appropriate next. Thank you Bob. Do you have a question? I do. Thank you for your presentation and for making sure that we all understand ACEs. I have a question. So there's a lot of research. There's been a lot of discussion for a few decades about this. If you if we were to ask the question for the children that are already in foster care that have had at least one or more ACEs, we could choose one policy decision to make in the state of Georgia that would help them be able to you know, not have additional ACEs impact them or to heal from the ACEs they had. What would that legislation look like? I appreciate that question and I'm happy to share what states are doing around this work. I know in CSL as your membership organization, we don't necessarily have model legislation to support this, but lots of different examples of how states are really working across that child well being continuum. Like you said, so research shows children do better when parents do better, right? And so mitigating the impact of the trauma that parents have already experienced to then work upstream and prevent future trauma from occurring is sort of the scope of the Children and Families program and we work across programs on NCSL with our other colleagues. I think the more we get into child abuse prevention work, the more research is showing how important economic supports as well as relational supports within the community are really reducing people from entering families from entering into that child welfare system. And so I know Chapin Hall has done a lot of significant research in the past couple of years on the impact of economic policies on preventing child abuse and neglect. And I think states are really looking to those policies as well. Tammy, from the health perspective, anything? Yes, thank you. I think the other part of this that we would think about, Heather, you touched on a little bit, are the the interplay and social determinants of health. So thinking about that economic stability, do folks have a house that they can be in, you know, it's really hard to prioritize your mental or physical health if you're more concerned with where your next meal is or where you're going to be sleeping that evening. So thinking about it from that perspective as well, you know, in Georgia and compared to what other states have done, one of the approaches that we first see is to really understand kind of the landscape of your community. So is it that housing is priority number one within a certain area or is it that just access to food is a priority and having that kind of understanding of those social determinants and the interplay with your health, I think it also helped to determine, you know, kind of your next steps and what that might look like as far as policy considerations. Thank you very much. Oh yeah, go right ahead. Thanks. On some of the deepened side, we also have done a lot of work on transition HU, then we're closely with our health team partners to look at policies that impact youth transitioning from the foster care system into adulthood. So happy to share any resources or any specific questions that you have about that. Thank you very much. Tammy and Heather are both based in Denver and so they had to get up pretty early to prepare for this and greatly appreciate that. And for those of you who are frantically trying to keep up with taking notes or whatever, these presentations will all be posted on the Senate website for our committee by next week. So you don't have to panic about the links and all that. Thank you all very much. We really appreciate the great information. Thank you for having us. Next week, I think I saw Dr. DeGarmo on Zoom. Yeah, and he's going to talk to us and Dr. DeGarmo can introduce himself, but he's an expert on foster care issues. And I've asked him to cover educational issues that kids in the foster system have. So Dr. Garma, you're on. Oh, thank you so much. I think you're the opportunity speaking from the committee. I appreciate you and every one of your service, these children in crisis. I'm afraid I'm unable to attend today. I'm doing several webinars for agencies across the country and then jumping out of plane to do a keynote of Pennsylvania. So I'm grateful for this opportunity right now. Before I was a foster parent, I was a teacher. I was a teacher. I taught in Michigan. I taught in Australia, my wife lives, her from and I taught in a couple different counties in the state of Georgia. And like so many in society, I believe the many, many myths and misconceptions that are associated with foster care. And one of those myths is the fact that the children are bad kids. That's what many people believe. Children are bad kids. Many teachers believe that as well. I'm going to tie into that in a little bit. I want you to imagine. I want you to imagine a child, maybe seven years of age, I'd be 13 years of age, I'd be 17 years of age. Suddenly, about me wanting whatsoever is removed from her home, removed from her mother, her father, her stuffed animals, her toys, her pillows, her presents, her her pets, her kitchen, her house her relatives, it should go to school, school and place into a new foster home, a foster home. And she's told this is your new family, this is your new house. And at night she cries this obviously because she's a brave, she's very, very, very, very filled with anxiety, filled with emotions and concerns as she can't process. The next morning she wakes up, she doesn't know she's able to have breakfast because she doesn't eat at her home. She goes to a strange school and she's run by strange students. She's given math work, spelling words, a science project, a booktree, somebody bumps into her in the cafeteria where everybody's laughing, they think she's laughing at her and her books spill all over the ground and she screams out, I want to go home. That is what it's like for so many children youth in foster care. School is not a priority whatsoever there. Instead of focusing on their math or their spelling quiz, they're focusing on, well I see my mother again, well I see my father again, well I ever go home. They are struggling to survive. And perhaps that's one of the reasons why children in foster care are on average 18 months behind academically than the traditional student. And perhaps that's why they struggle in reading and math skills. Today's teachers, like myself so many years ago, are not equipped. They don't understand the many, many challenges that children foster care experience every single day. Instead of focusing on that math test, that child is immersed in feelings of grief and loss from being removed from their home. You know right now we're in a real pandemic of mental health issues. And those issues cross over to those children foster care as well. And as I said earlier, they are embroiled or they are immersed in feelings and concerns and emotions that they can't process that they don't understand. So they do one of two things at school. And I did a study, my doctoral dissertation was on this very topic. I wanted to bring together teachers and case workers and foster parents together to help these children survive in school. And so when these children are in the classroom, they do one of two things. They either withdraw because the emotions are overwhelming them and they might lay their head down or they lash out. And so many teachers and even school administrators don't understand those anxieties and those mental health issues as children are feeling. So these children end up in ISS. They end up in, they end up expelled and the big suspended. In fact, we are seeing so many children foster care being removed from school, being suspended, being expelled. Because again, they're lashing out from all those emotions that they're immersed in. And our teachers and our administrators are not equipped to handle that. And neither are many foster parents. And so that leads to what happens in many kids and foster care when they reach that age of 18 in the system and they're ready to transition out or age out. 55% of them will quit school. We'll never receive that high school diploma. We'll never receive that GED because in their minds, school and foster care has failed them. And they don't want to be part of that anymore. I've had so many kids come through my own home who have been in high school and have struggled with that. So that 55% that drop out of school, what does that lead to? Well, many statistics will say that 65% will end up homeless, 75% will end up incarcerated. And then the cycle repeats itself for so many. In fact, I may have tested, said this when I was speaking front of you in January, two of the three that I've adopted are third generation foster care, which means their parents and their grandparents were also in the foster care system and never got the help that they needed. Again, statistics will show you that only 6% will go to college and only 2% will graduate with a four-year degree. Now, whether they get the college or whether they even get the high school diploma, we all know that in today's society, if you don't have the very least high school diploma and a Tor GED, the success rate is very, very low. So it's important that our schools today are equipped with those support systems that those children in their classrooms need desperately. I can recall so many times children place in my home and then I enroll them in school and the school is unable to because of missing transcripts, not enough information, not test grades. They don't know where to place those children. So many times children foster care are placed into a classroom where they're not getting the special support services that they need. So school is, for many kids in foster care, it's the last place they want to be because everything about school reminds them that they are a foster kid, a label that no child wants. I'd be happy to answer any questions at this time. Thank you, Dr. DiGarma. I have one question I'm sitting here thinking about. I don't think we specifically invited the Department of Education, the State Board of Education to attend our meeting, but it sounds like one policy thing that we could work on is a better connection between the foster, the folks at the H.S. dealing with foster care, the Department of Education, and try to bridge that gap somehow and figure out the best way to equip those teachers. Do you have any thoughts about that? I'd like to agree more. There's an excellent point. Thank you for asking. Yes, indeed, we need to do that. Schools need to be connected to the caseworker and to the foster parents. And as we all know, today's caseworkers are overworked, overwhelmed under resource, under supported, under staff, underpaid, or having a hard time retaining our caseworkers, as well as our foster parents across the state. But we need to bring those three entities together in order for that child to have the even the dream of succeeding in school or thriving in school. So many times, I want you to imagine that child who is in foster care who has that meltdown, who has that blow up, you feel will, because he is really struggling with his mental health issues in the classroom. He's getting no help. And he sent to an administrator's office, and the administrator has no idea what's going on. So what do they do? They just send that kid home. They just remove the child he's expelled or suspended. And that's what happens to so many of them. And then when they go from school to school to school, they fall further and further behind in academics. That's why it's so critical for children to remain in that same foster parent home. So they don't go from school to school to school and get further further behind. As I mentioned earlier, 18 months behind nationwide on average in the traditional student. Thank you, Senator Payne. Thanks for being here, Dr. and thank you for your testimony. As a state probation officer for 30 years and working with these kids, I saw so many times, you know, a child that had gotten into minor trouble as they came into foster care going through that adjustment and that the rough, they've asked out at some point or getting a fight at school. And I said, but you see them in that first instance. And then it might be just something minor. We just do a warning or whatever and then you know, to get them back on the right path. But then you see them a year later with more severe charges. And when they're a total different animal and you find out that they're in they're in their third foster home now. And so I just that's what always goes back to me is what are we doing or what are states doing to soften that initial blow of a child coming into foster care so that can be, you know, the allow for services wrap around services to be put in place with that child before they just get thrown into a home in the middle of the night with those strange kids and with those strange family, you know, just to make that that soften that change of life that so many kids were not prepared to handle. Well, you know, that's a great question. And I think back to 22 years ago when I first became a foster parent and a child was placed in my home and I very mistakenly thought this child's going to be happy to be here in my house because it kind of provides the ability and safety and unconditional love and consistency and structure. Why was I wrong? You know, it's the last place they want to be. It's you mentioned they're going from school to school to full. And that's something that we need to really focus on. How do we keep the children in their foster care home and a stable home throughout their 10 year foster instead of going from home to home, multiple displacement is known as. And every time a child goes from home to home, not only do they fall further, further behind academically, but as I'm sure you can imagine there are more issues of attachment. There are more issues of trust. Who can they trust? Can they trust this new teacher? Can they trust this new foster parent? Can they trust this new caseworker? And of course, their mental health is threatened as well. So foster parents need to be equipped with not only the information regarding school, but you said how do we soften if you will? How do we soften those first few nights that are filled with anxiety? Is terrifying being placed into a foster care home? Our foster parents have to understand that and meet the child where they're at and that requires some more training for their foster parents in that regard. But a great question. Thank you for asking. And thank you for your 30 years of service. Well, thank you. Thank you very much, Dr. DiGarmo. Appreciate your joining us even though you're out of town. Thank you so much. Okay, next we have voices for George Children. We've got Melissa, Haberlinda Wofan, Wendy White, Tigrain. Come on up. Thank you. And committee members, you have their presentation and your folder. Yeah. I'm sure you're going to be able to do that. Chair Karpakhtrek and commission members, thank you so much for having us today. I'm Wendy White, Tigrain. I'm not with voices for George Children, although I do enjoy working so closely beside that amazing team. I'm with the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities. And service the Medicaid director and health system innovation director for that department. And we're going to be co-presenting today as co-chairs of a particular work group that we'll get into describing in one moment. I should use your cell. Hi there. Melissa, Haberlinda Wofan, I'm the research and policy director at Voices for George's Children and it's great to be with you all today. Thank you for having us. So we are going to go through the first few slides at a dizzying speed. So I won't go ahead and apologize to you because we'd like to get to the meat of the real content which is deeper in. But we will just remind you, today we are here representing mind works, which is the Interagency Directors team, which was largely set up through a piece of legislation called Children and Adolescence Mental Health System of Care Law. And it established that multiple agencies who serve children should come together for collaboration in order to work together, not duplicate different pieces and parts of work. And you're looking at the second slide, which is really a calendar of the emerging work that happened prior to that and then as a result of that, the IDT, part of that law sets forth a three year plan. And part of that plan in what was adopted through the Behavioral Health Coordinating Council also set forth in a different law was to create a state plan. And one of the goals in that state plan was to create a behavioral health children's system financial map. So if you think about like where the money sits for children's behavioral health, that is what we are going to share with you today and that we embarked upon the exercise. So we are here today representing mind works, Melissa and I co-chaired the bulk of all of this implementation work and the research evaluation and putting together this initiative. The next slide is just a list of now all the amazing partners who are part of IDT. So not just the state agencies, but many other agencies who are represented in this room, the state agencies as well as many for-profit, non-profit advocacy and policy health leadership on children's behavioral health. And this type of mapping that we're going to talk to you about today, there's just a few states who have embarked upon this type of financial mapping initiative, but you see here briefly just the small representation. So Georgia is in a new and emerging position to jump into this body of work, but we're ready to jump in and learn as much as possible on this. So from this point, that's the context setting. We're going to talk a little bit about how we went about understanding what a financial map could look like in Georgia and how we would gather that data. So we actually kicked off this initiative in December of 2020. So as you can imagine, we were coming out of the wake of the PHE and jumping into this huge body of work. We had to decide at that point in time that we would look at fiscal year 2019 data. We understood that fiscal year 2020 was radically disrupted. We had revenue concerns here in Georgia, therefore budget cuts, while we were also experiencing federal money coming in. So every agency's budget began to be radically altered. And so we needed a good baseline year, which would tell us what the real landscape is based on appropriations as well as the standard and more stable federal funds, which could come to the state. And in order to embark upon this, we had to then kind of name the agencies who have children's behavioral health impact and financing, which you see in this flower representation here. And then Melissa and I, along with members of the Center of Excellence for Children's Behavioral Health at Georgia State University, began interviews with all of the leadership, financial leadership and executive leadership of these organizations to discern how to start organizing this kind of information. So we began surveying program and service name, program and service type, the number of children you served, the region served, age ranges served, we had to discern kind of what would be our cutoffs, which I will go ahead and share with you. We surveyed up through 26, understanding that transitional age, young adult issues are critical. And we began, of course, at zero. And so began further back all the way then through 26. We had to contemplate what is an intervention phase. And I'm going to talk a bit more about that in a moment. What's the difference and the balance of state to federal spending? And what were the federal sources of that funding? I do want to put in one caveat, decal has been very involved with us in this. And their first kind of funds that were appropriated for this were appropriated in fiscal year 20. So they are the one agency when they are represented on this chart and the graphs that you are going to look at is one year off because we really wanted to include that zero to three work that is emerging from that department. So when I talk about an intervention stage, we needed to understand from each agency the type of behavioral health work that they were doing so that we could have some points of comparison. So as we began the interviews, we began grouping these into these four large buckets of treatment types. So prevention, which is really working with social messaging, early kind of educational things like the PBIS program for the Department of Education, Suicide, Mental Health Awareness campaigns, etc. Then early intervention, which is really kind of aimed at young people who have some risk and have some emerging presentation of concern and doing early engagement like wellness programs, mental health consultations, peer support, etc. Intervention, which is a really big category. Let me just say which is basic treatment, basic recovery support. It would be about building some baseline capacity for treatment as well as doing some skill-based intervention. In that, we included comprehensive child and family assessment and community-based services that are a little more on the traditional side, like individual therapy, group therapy, family therapy, and the light. And then late intervention, which again is you're going to see kind of the investments the state has to make there. These include inpatient psychiatric services, crisis stabilization, residential treatment, mobile crisis, very intensive, high end services for then higher risk individuals. So the next slide, I will go ahead and indicate that we just have an error. It's not $538 total spending. It's $538 million in total spending. And this is your macro map. Everything that Melissa and I will talk about from this point in time is anchored into this proportional distribution graphic. And so everyone can kind of see here the largest purchaser in behavioral health services for children in Georgia is the Department of Community Health. We're going to dive into that detail in one moment. The second largest investor, the Department of Education. And then the third DBHDD, then you see defects just below that. And then the smaller representative samples you see in the lower left side. So this is the ultimate map that is a representation of all the work in play. So the next slide. As we indicated, one of our major questions was about the state and federal mix of spending. Again, many of the federal programs allow Georgia to invest a dollar or upstate funds and then yield federal match at different variable rates. So we really wanted to look at that content. So again, if you remember our four green buckets, we're going to keep talking about those. So I hope you anchored into them. Prevention, early intervention, intervention, late intervention, are your rows at the top in the teal and peach colors. And so you can see the amount of balance we have between federal and state funds in each of those types of very broad intervention categories. And then underneath this, you can see for each agency, those four categories. Again, if you'll look down across the bottom, prevention, early intervention, intervention, late intervention, every agency then has a pie chart representing its balance. And I just want to point out like a couple of representative examples to help you absorb this. So if you look, for instance, at the agency that I represent, DBHD, you can see a pretty hearty diversity in those bucket categories. You see all four of the colors and you see that type of representation. Did you have a quick question? Oh, we're sorry, not to interrupt you, but I know what most of these acronyms are, but I don't know all of them. And I don't know if everybody knows all of them. Would you mind just, I know you've covered some of them, but would you mind just telling us what they all are? And if I stumble on the couple, I know it's the one that helped me. Department of community health, the first one, Department of Education, the second one, DBHD, Department of Behavioral Health, and Developmental Disabilities. DeFacts is a division. It's under DHS, but it's the division of Family and Children Services, DJJ, Department of Juvenile Justice, GVRA, which is the Georgia Vocational Rehab Agency. DeCal, the Department of Early Care and Learning.\n\nThank you, always stumble on that one. DPH, the Department of Public Health and EHS, HSS, that's the Head Start and Early Head Start agency. Yeah, absolutely. Glad to clarify that. Okay. So again, just to give a couple of those representative examples, I was talking about the diversity and funding type with DPHDD. And then if you look at DJJ, very clearly a singular type of intervention, young people who are generally involved in receiving treatment and juvenile justice are already at a point of having some kind of restriction of their freedoms. They've been either in a YDC and RYDC and it's very late in intervention. Therefore, all of that is represented in a single color representing late intervention. And so this really is the overarching large mapping snapshots. We are going to present just a subset of agencies because we don't have the time to get into every agency, but we wanted you to get a good picture of kind of the largest funders and some takeaways related to that. So Melissa is going to pick it up from this point. Sure. So starting with the Department of Community Health. And again, you see there that the total spend is $231.6 million. And that's about 43% of the total state spending among the different child serving state agencies. Together, when you look at DPH and the Georgia Department of Education, that's going to be about three-fourths of the total spending on child and adolescent behavioral health. It makes sense that DPH is going to be the biggest spender because more than half of all the children in our state have their health insurance covered via Medicaid. It's about 1.7 million children. And so this is why DPH and Medicaid are a very important part of providing behavioral health services to our kids. Again, as Wendy said, we went up to age 26. Medicaid is typically covering up to age 19. For children in foster care, they're covered up until age 26. And so what we did for Medicaid was we pulled by claims data, those who had a primary or secondary diagnosis, I'm not sure if there's something going on with the mic. Can you all hear OK? OK. OK. There we go. So we were looking at children and young adults who had a primary or secondary behavioral health diagnosis. And then we were pulling for those who had behavioral health-related procedure codes, as well as behavioral health prescriptions. So one thing that you're going to see on the slide is that we did just for simplicity sake, we had to put prescription drugs into the intervention bucket. But of course, prescription drugs are a medical medication management or a really important part of late intervention services too. So that's something where we just had to make some decisions about which phase of the continuum to put things into. But what you really see here are first that there is a lot of spending within the intervention phase, outpatient community and prescription drugs. What you also see is that with Medicaid, one of the reasons why folks are always so interested in leveraging this program, not only are they covering more than half the kids in our state, but also you see that healthy federal matching rate that helps to pay for these services. So at that point, the federal matching rate was almost $0.70 on the dollar for every dollar that was spent. And so that's one reason why folks really like to leverage this program for the services. In the late intervention phases, you see things like crisis management services, psychiatric residential treatment facilities, and then hospital and patient costs. And one thing to note for you all in particular is that once we get into the next slide where we can go ahead, this is where you see the breakout by the different programs. And Georgia Family's 360, that's going to be the program that's serving our foster care and adoption assistance populations, as well as some youth who are in juvenile justice in the community programs. And then Georgia Families is going to be the low-income, Medicaid, eligible children and young adults, and then Medicaid fee for service. That's typically age-blind disable, but for children, of course, you can strike the age from that grouping. And so what you see here that's, I think, particularly interesting is if you look down at the chart at the bottom, you see the different amount of spends by these different groupings. You see that fee for service, though serving a much smaller number of children and young adults is spending almost as much as Georgia Families, which is administered by our care management organizations. And they are serving a much larger population, but that's just one interesting place to note and dig in. Also, you see Georgia Families up there. And while they're spending probably a little bit less than fee for service per person, they're also spending about five times as much per person as Georgia Families. One other important piece to note too is that when we had to pull all of this data together, we were able to get from the managed care entities, again, who are in charge of Georgia Families, in Georgia Families 360. We were able to get it drilled down to the number of individuals who are served by these dollar amounts. For fee for service, we're looking at something a little bit different. We're looking at the services provided, so there are potentially duplicates in the number of children and young adults who are served by this money. The next bucket is the Georgia Department of Education with $168.6 million again. And so we have a little bit under 1.7 million children who are in our public school systems. And the majority of this dollar amount is made up of special education dollars. So what we did here, and again, this is ages three through 21 because we do have this preschool special education program contained within the Georgia Department of Education and then special ed services can go up to age 21. What you see here that's really interesting is that of course, there's spending across the entire spectrum. If you total prevention and early intervention services, you have about $9 million of spending and the prevention is where you see things like what Wendy mentioned, PBIS, positive behavioral interventions and supports, school climate, mental health related trainings, things that are sort of universally disseminated to all students that are in public schools. One other piece to note is that the Georgia APEX program which delivers school-based behavioral health services to many schools in our state, that's actually funded, it flows through the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities. So while it's in school settings, you will see that dollar amount included in DPHDD's funding. The real interesting piece to focus here on with the Department of Education, again, is the large amount of spending in the intervention and late intervention phases, which is again, special ed program spending. And when we pulled these dollar amounts, we were really looking at children and youth who had a primary emotional or behavioral diagnosis through the special ed program and that's how they were receiving a number of services that are counted here under this funding. And then of course, at the very end, you see G-Nets, just an important thing to note, if you kind of do a little bit of back of the envelope math, you can see that per child, there's about a $25,000 spend per child. And again, G-Nets is really sort of the highest level of care that a child with severe emotional and behavioral disturbances would be receiving supports and education services in our state. Yes. On this chart you have here is on the prevention side, is there really a study to look at if we spend more on the prevention side that the intervention and the late intervention goes down? Yes, sir. I think not just within the DOE, but also just generally. So unfortunately, because of time-sake, we weren't able to dig into a lot of the prevention dollars that are happening through the Department of Public Health, babies can't wait, again preschool special ed, as well as decal, and that's where you really have the opportunity to bend the curve and lower the acuity of need and the cost later on. So absolutely. I have one question. Developmental disabilities, are they included in this number? Autism, and that's the only. Only August. Okay. Senator Payne, what's going to add one other comment to your question? Early intervention, there's actually much more research on early intervention where you're doing something individualized, but kind of a low grade, but early intervention. And that really research really supports it. There's much more impact to that in changing that long-term trajectory. So I just wanted to add in, you were talking about the prevention portion, but on all of these, that early intervention, there seems to be a lot more research because you can follow up on outcomes when you know that it's kind of a one-on-one individually identified individual. So I just wanted to offer that as well. So I'm going to go and take this one since this is our organization. The next agency is DBHDD. And you'll see that we have about 85.9 million total in the funds that are specifically allocated and dedicated to children, young adults and their families. And again, the next slide, you'll notice, again, we talked about the diversity of the funding array. So the font is much smaller, but the graphic representation, I think you can easily follow looking at some of the types of categories that are represented here. So again, as we kind of indicated, Melissa indicated in the Department of Education, Presentation, youth who are in the educational system are also receiving healthcare. And so through DBHDD, you see very specifically the APEX program in the intervention category, almost dead center in your slide. So you all have made a very significant investment in APEX and we are delighted to be providing services in those schools. That is in addition, of course, then to the Department of Education. Medicaid, the Department of Community Health also provides healthcare services to young people in the Department of Education. So these things kind of are complex in that kind of tapestry. But I do want to point out that, you know, as you look towards the far right of this continuum, of course, crisis types of services are some of the most expensive services. They are generally 24-7. You are engaged with individuals for whom you are not sure the severity of their crisis. And so very proportionally, you can see here, there's more state. Funds dedicated here, less federal. That is largely because of some federal Medicaid rules about the size of facilities. And there are interventions such as like the Georgia Crisis and Access Line and Mobile Crisis where we don't always know and insurer. Those are interventions that can be done confidentially without with anonymity. And so in many cases, we can't leverage, for instance, a Medicaid funding dollar for those in the most aggressive of ways. We do still try to leverage some federal funds related to those. And so you see those representative balances. And now on to defects where we have $21.6 million in spending. So here you can see that there's a good amount of spending that's taking place on behavioral health services. Again, this is an SFY 2019. But really mainly in the late intervention phase, as well as a little bit in the intervention and early intervention phases. And you'll see that for defects, the behavioral health spending is going to be largely purely state dollars. So that's one important thing to notice. I think, hoteling the spending at that point was a little bit under $4 million. I know that that has changed quite a bit too and changes year to year. And this has become a big topic that you guys are also working to try and untangle the costs around. But just wanted to point that out, as well as the very large spend on psychiatric residential treatment facilities. So I think these are two areas, again, that warrant a little bit more digging into the why it is this way, and particularly when we know that the DCH is in charge and Georgia Families 360 or in charge of providing behavioral health services to this population. So unpacking a little bit, why there is the state spending in these areas would be particularly important. The last agency that we're going to go over is the Department of Juvenile Justice. That's $16.8 million in spending. And what we have here again, similar to de-facts, there's a large spend that's happening with state dollars to support these services. We can't, for the most part, leverage Medicaid to pay for services when a child is in a secure facility, though there are some exciting changes and opportunities coming up federally to leverage a little bit more as youth are going to be entering or exiting facilities. But right now, what we have included in this spend is really the cost of services that are delivered to the children on the behavioral health caseloads, children that are in the regional youth detention centers, which is the more temporary facilities, and then the youth development campuses, which are the more long-term facilities. And so some of the items that we were not able to include here, but just wanted to mention too, is that DJJ does have to contract for intensive in-home services and psychiatric residential treatment facility services that they then pay for on their own. That was something that we were not able to include, but would love to include in the future to get an understanding of that spending, but also why that's occurring too. And if there's another opportunity to pay for it under a different stream, as well as a room board and watch oversight, that's also not included in this count. But again, DJJ, while the services could span across the continuum, we consider the behavioral health services that these children are receiving to be really in the late intervention phase because of where they are. So the last bit of the presentation, again, is just sort of the plug of what comes next. And Wendy can speak on this a little bit more to, I think one of the main things that came up during this exercise was something that you all are very familiar with, which is the need for better data sharing between the different state agencies. It took a very long time for us to just gather these little data to put together for this program over a year from some state agencies that took to get this information. So this is something that we would like to see this study replicated and updated so that it's maybe more timely and can inform you all too and some of the decision making about budgeting. Also, if we can move to a place where there can be sharing of data where there are unique identifiers. So identifiers that can link some of the high utilizers because we know that there are some youth and children that are in the intensive buckets across all of these different state agencies. And in order to figure out solutions for how to better care for those children, have better results and outcomes, but also save some money that it's really critical that we can actually link the data for those individuals. And so the next effort is really, again, like I said, mine works will be working to update the financial mapping to be more recent and then also to go into a sort of mapping 2.0 where they will be looking at more details around the services and supports that are provided and also looking at the demographic profiles of the children that are being served. So diagnoses, geography, racial and ethnic differences and that sort of thing so that we can get a better understanding of exactly what the services are that are being provided, how they're working and where the gaps and opportunities lie. I think you have to do that well. So yes, we want this really to just be step one in a foundational process. So we hope we can be back with you in the future and share more information as we continue to learn it. So are there any specific questions? Thank you very much for your very detailed presentation. Our heads are filled with numbers. I wanted to let you know that and you probably already know this about two weeks ago, the governor did an executive order which gave the Georgia Data Analytics Center some more tools. And so I think our data sharing is going to continue to improve and of course that's always subject to all state and federal privacy regulations. The other thing that I wanted to do is ask, I put Commissioner Brose on the spot for just a moment to give us a little quick update on what's going on with hoteling because she's really been a warrior for this and I'd like to hear how we're doing on that. Thank you very much. Thank you. Hi everyone. Good morning. My name is Keen Disprose. And I'm the Georgia Department of Human Services Commissioner and the state defects director. I will keep my update very brief. We after months and months, years of our agency through the division of family and children services focusing on ending hoteling and trying as many different strategies and creative ideas that we could possibly fathom and with support from the governor's office and lieutenant governor and the general assembly. On September 8th, we reached zero. We had on that night no child in our custody staying in a hotel or office. It was a huge milestone, a very emotional one for defects. And we didn't do a lot of celebration because we know, again, that it's a moving target. On any given day, we have kids at inter custody or may disrupt their current placement in a foster home or congregate care setting and we have to consider a hotel. But we were absolutely thrilled to finally reach that. And since that time, we have been staying at zero or really keeping the use of hotels or office stays at the minimum for true emergency situations. Last night, we had three kids statewide that ended up needing to stay in a hotel. All of those were emergencies, true emergencies. None of them were in Fultonard to Cap County, which is remarkable. In fact, in those two counties, we have had, we've stayed at zero. We've got a streak running, which is really fantastic when you consider the population of children in custody in those two counties. For these three children that stayed in a hotel last night, one of them was in Douglas. It was a 17 year old female. She's been on runaway for some time. And so we found her and it was last second and we're trying to find an appropriate placement for her so that she can recover from what we think is some trafficking victimization. In Stevens County, we had a 10 year old male. He came into our custody a few days ago. He has really extreme behaviors, very traumatic past. And so we need to find a foster home for him. And that would be a foster home that doesn't have other children in the home. And given his needs, we don't have a huge supply of those kinds of specialized foster homes. So we're trying to find the right one. We think we've got some good leads. We don't think they'll be staying in a hotel another night. And then the last would be in coffee county. It was a 14 year old male. He had actually been in an emergency room and he was discharged yesterday. And so he too has some extreme behaviors, some mental health issues that we're trying to find the right setting for him. But again, you're talking about three. Whereas this time last year, we would have had a number closer to 50, 60, 70 in one night. Thank you so much for your hard work on this issue. Thank you. I appreciate it. Join effort. Thank you. Thank you. OK, we're a little bit behind. So we're going to keep going here and try to finish all our morning presentations before it gets too late. So next we have Mincey Fiers from Gears. And they're going to talk about Georgia Thrive and you've got somebody else with you. Yeah, actually, Cal and Wells with Gears. And Mincey Fiers is with Georgia State Center of Excellence for Children's Behavioral Health. OK, perfect. And we'll just do quick introductions. So to kind of kick us off, I am Cal and Wells, the Senior Health Policy Manager with Gears, the Georgia Early Education Alliance for Ready Students. And we're really excited because you guys have already gotten us started today talking about infant health or courts. And Gears serves as the kind of policy partner for Georgia State Center of Excellence. So I'll let Mincey introduce herself. Good morning. And thank you, Chairwoman Kirk Patrick and the Committee for this opportunity. I am Mincey Fiers as Cal and has explained I am a research associate at the Center of Excellence for Children's Behavioral Health. That's at the Georgia Health Policy Center with the Georgia State University. And for this particular program, I serve as the State Coordinator for the Georgia Thrive Infant Houder Court Program. So I'm happy to speak with you today and introduce this program to you. So the objective is just to bring an introduction to the infant hotly court program that Georgia was recently awarded. And before I dig into the details of the program, I will really talk about why age is zero to three. And I think the committee is already aware there and we've kind of touched on the importance of age is zero to three. And this program really addresses aims to address infant and early childhood mental health challenges and to really mitigate that. And as you can see on the slide, infant and early childhood mental health really drives to the developing capacity of young children to really develop emotional attachments, experiences and really develop in their brain function. We know that these are key foundational ages in brain development. So this slide briefly shows how from zero to three, there are many new neural connections within the brain. And these are the pivotal ages for children to have foundational as I mentioned relationships. And we've also known from research that foundations and experiences during ages zero to three can impact their foundation and mental health later in life. So this program, the infant hotly court program hopes to mitigate that. And what we want to highlight is and the stress is that we know that traumatic experiences can hinder development even for infants and toddlers ages zero to three. And that could lead to mental health challenges in the future. So the infant and toddler court program here in Georgia will be implemented using the Safe Babies approach. The Safe Babies approach was developed in the early 2000s by the National Organization zero to three. And zero to three is an organization that really focuses on early childhood development of those early years specifically. The Safe Babies approach is a collaborative, multi-disciplinary approach. And it really works to strengthen the family and it puts the needs of the family and the child at the center to really create a stable, healthy environment for the child to thrive as they age. The Safe Babies approach is really guided by five key areas of focus that is continuous quality improvement, interdisciplinary collaborative and proactive teamwork, enhanced oversight and collaborative problem solving, expedited appropriate and effective services and trauma responsive support. And due to time, I won't go into the details of each area of focus, that's on the slide. But I want to point out that these areas of focus within this program are implemented concurrently at the child and family level and at the state and site level. And what this program does is addresses the needs of the child and the family and at the same time aims to bring systems level changes within a community at the local site and within state agencies as well. So this slide shows a little bit of data from earlier this year and this is from Department of Health and Human Services, administration or children, youth and families, children's bureau, and it shows that the highest rates amount treatment in Georgia is in the 10,\n\nor ages of zero to three, which is another reason that we feel that this program would be very impactful for those early ages. So as I mentioned earlier, Georgia is one of 12 states nationwide that received federal funding to implement this program. And the Center of Excellence for Children's Behavior Health at Georgia State University was awarded this funding to implement three pilot sites within the state over the next four years. And you can see our mission and our vision here on the slide. But to sum it up, our goal is to integrate trauma responsive services in the child welfare system and in the court system and to provide supportive services and supportive resources for families that are in the child welfare system with children ages zero to three, particularly to provide linkages to substance use disorder treatment resources for families and mental health resources for families and babies to really form those attachments with families and their children of these ages. So the project goal of Georgia Thrive is to improve Georgia statewide systems and policies to support young children and families who are involved or at risk of involvement with the child welfare system and build capacity to prevent child maltreatment more broadly. I appreciate Dr. Constantineau for really stressing the importance of safe baby and infant toddler court programs earlier this day. He has been a champion of this and a key partner in this work. And so I want to reiterate what you said, Dr. Constantineau, by talking about how infant toddler courts are integral and intentional about keeping babies and families at the center of his work. And they do that by advocating for more opportunities for families to bond with their babies, even while children are in foster care, really advocated for opportunities for the babies to remain connected with their families. That's pretty important. And incorporating the voices of families with lived experience that have already been through this system to help us inform changes that need to be made at the site level and at the state level. And really raising awareness of the importance of identifying unique developmental needs and mental health resources for infants and toddlers that are already in this system. Now, this is a brief synopsis on the differences between infant toddler court programs and traditional dependency court hearings. And I just highlight a couple of points that infant toddler court hearings are held every 30 to 45 days. So the families meet more frequently with a dependency court judge. And that is really to help the family remain on track with their case plan and really allows the judge to make sure that they are receiving the links to all the services that they need to remain supportive and in a stable environment. Also infant toddler court programs, as I've mentioned, they are collaborative and multidisciplinary. And so each family is provided a number of resources and agencies surrounding them to insulate them and really connect them to treatment services to any social services needed for the family and the child. And also in infant toddler courts, the champion is typically the judge and the judge really promotes a collaboration around each family to include all of the attorneys, the any type of providers that are providing treatment services for the parent and the child and the defense case manager as well. They work in unison to really provide support and help to the family. As a new grantee, Georgia was at the opportunity to visit Iowa earlier this year. And Iowa has one of the oldest infant toddler court programs in the country established in early 2000s. And we were able to just see the differences between an infant toddler court which is the picture on the left and a traditional dependency courtroom, the picture on the right. And the picture on the left shows quilts and also in this courtroom, there were diapers, there were toys, there were bookshelves, books for kids and books for adults. It really looked like a daycare within a courtroom. And the judge was very compassionate towards the mom and we had the opportunity to witness a hearing. And the particular hearing that we saw was a young mother with an eight-month-old infant and the young mother came in and she had challenges adhering to her case plan and she was very nervous about the prospect of losing her losing custody of her eight-month-old. She had an older child that she had lost custody of and so she was very fearful that she was going to have her infant removed and never see her infant again. And she expressed that to the judge and she also admitted that she realized she was having challenges with her case plan and she broke down and started to cry. What the amazing thing was that the defects case manager, the defects attorney and the attorney for the child and the attorney for the mom, they all stopped the hearing and the judge allowed them to go over to the mom and they all gave her a hug and the defects case manager and the defects attorney looked at the mom and they told the mom, we're all here to help you, we don't want you to lose your baby. We're all going to work together and figure out what additional supports that you need that we can help you. So the entire team embraced this mom and the judge allowed them time to meet with the mom and they worked together to identify the additional help that the mother needed and they all made sure that mom was on track to keep custody of her infant. And so it was amazing to see that collaboration in progress and so that was the foundations of safe babies court. And I now turn it over to Kalen Wells. Thank you. In your folders, there's a document that is related to Georgia Thrive and I won't take up a ton more time but I just wanted to point out a few things. So as Mitzi mentioned, Georgia Thrive happens kind of when a child is in foster care, kind of in parallel to a dependency court process. And what's really different about infant toddler courts is that connection to resources as well as mental health services. So Dr. Constantine has talked about this before. That connection to mental health services is really critical for families in terms of keeping families together for reunification. And this body has done a lot of work to help build, develop mentally appropriate mental health services for parents and young children through investments through the Department of Early Care and Learning as well as a number of other state agencies have come together to invest in this workforce. So we're really grateful for that. I wanted to point out too that Georgia has seen an increase in the percentage of infants and toddlers entering foster care between 2011 and 2018, a 44% increase, which is more than any other Southern state. Additionally, we know as Mitzi mentioned, that infants and toddlers are most likely to receive de-fact services as well as most likely to enter foster care. The Safe Babies approach has, you know, significant outcomes that Dr. Constantine mentioned about reduction of time to reunification. This is on the second page and overall permanency. So the understanding too that when the family of origin is not able to maintain custody of the child, there's shorter time to permanency for children and Safe Babies approach courts. So we have some recommendations around supporting Georgia Thrive. One is to consider opioid settlement funds. So our friends at NCSL talked about parent substance use as one of the main reasons for children being removed from the home. That's especially true for infants and toddlers. And so thinking about the opioid settlement funds as one way to fund infant toddler courts, additionally considering state funding to match some of the federal funding that's coming in and then continuing to invest in those mental health supports that are developmentally appropriate for young children and families. I know children's health care of Atlanta is also beginning to put a lot of investment into those types of supports. Similarly to our friends at NCSL, we also have some recommendations about preventing foster placement for infants and toddlers. Around economic supports, there's a number of recommendations around TANF, which again, this body did a lot of work on last session as well as substance use treatment, specifically family-based residential treatment. So in Georgia, these are called women's treatment and recovery services where women can go and the children can go with them, which, you know, fear of a child being removed is one reason that women don't seek treatment. Also lifting up peer support specialists in NICUs. North East Georgia has a program that places peer support specialists in NICUs that has seen a lot of success. So thinking about growing that. And then the last series of recommendations is around can-ship care because we know that like our friends at NCSL mentioned, children really thrive in the kind of stability and with attachment. So knowing that there's, you know, someone who they've already known before being placed into care can really help maintain that stability. So thank you so much again for giving us the opportunity to speak and we will answer questions. Thank you very much for your presentation. I do have a question about, you said you're a new grantee, so I'd like to know where that's coming from and also what you had in mind for potential locations and how much money you'd be looking for to operate that pilot if you will. Okay. So in September 2022, we received funding from HRSA, Health Resources and Services Administration to implement this for five years and we are looking to pilot this in three different locations. One would be a metro location. The second would be a rural location. And the third location would serve as a prevention and intervention site. So we have developed a request for application that will be released early next month to solicit any nonprofit organizations, any court jurisdictions to apply to be a subgrantee as you will to implement this in their local community. So the total HRSA funding for the five years is three million and the each implement and site is getting 60,000 per federal year for per fiscal year. So 60,000 a year for the next four years for each local year. So each site will get 60,000 per year, which in when we looked at the spending on what we're spending on this, that's a great investment in terms of the outcomes. Okay, and I'm sure our friends at DPHCD, Commissioner Tanner, have us to be the trustee for the opioid settlement funds. And so I'm sure that he'll be made aware of this. Great. Request other questions from the committee. So thank you for that great presentation. So the court and Iowa that you visited, how have several questions? Did they how long have they been doing the safe babies in toddler courtroom? And what if you know, do you have any information on like reunification of families based on their their program? And one more question just to follow up with that. I see that it's a trauma responsive. Is there any particular type of training that the people in the court are going through like trust-based relational intervention, which has been wildly successful in Texas courts? That's all my questions. With Iowa, then I'll take the training. Yep. So Iowa has been implementing safe babies court since 2005. So they were one of the first jurisdictions in Polk County, Polk County, Iowa to institutes. I don't have data specifically from Iowa's courts, but safe babies nationally zero to three conducted an evaluation of all of the safe babies courts. And their data shows that children achieve reunification at 90 days to 120 days faster than in traditional court systems. Sorry, this is on the document that's in your folder. There is a significant amount of data from Florida where there are 35 sites across the state. Florida has done a significant amount of investment in safe babies courts. Again, significant amount of investment still looks very low because it's typically hiring a coordinator who is able to kind of work within the court system to connect family to resources and mental health services. And so we see you can see here the data from Florida as well as the investments from Florida, Tennessee, South Carolina, Arkansas, and North Carolina. And then your other question was about training. So the training is specifically for working with infants and toddlers. And the training that I believe we'll be using in Georgia is called Circle of Security, which is an evidence-based program. We have a trainer who's located, we have a couple trainers who are located here in Georgia. And then the type of training that the mental health clinicians have received is called Child Parent Psychotherapy, which is also an evidence-based program. And it is about addressing trauma specifically for infants and toddlers with their caregivers. So the caregiver, of course, can be the parent of origin, the foster parent. Sometimes the clinician works with both because there is that movement towards permanency with the foster parent, with an adoptive parent. So that Child Parents Psychotherapy really is about addressing the specific traumas that have occurred in that child's life. So you were talking about earlier, what are some ways that a child who's already in foster care, who has, as we know, experienced aces, might be able to recover for young children, child parents psychotherapy is one of those ways because it's really about naming and addressing the trauma that has occurred and then healing the relationship and really focusing on that attachment relationship with the caregiver and the child. And, can you tell us how the 35 sites in Florida are funded? Is that all heard some money? So at least 20 of the positions are funded by the state. So the state legislature appropriated about $1.92 million to support those infant-toddler courts and then HRSA is funding a variety of them and also sometimes counties fund to them. So in Georgia actually Douglas County funded a site through Judge Peggy Walker, who has presented here a number of times and she actually received county funds. So there can be a mixture of state, local and federal dollars to support the United States. Dr. Constantino. Yeah. Presentation and thanks for all you're doing for this really important cause. And I, one of the points to the Center for Patrick's question is that these relatively modest expenses actually catalyze the convergence of a lot of care on these families. So for example, when you develop a comprehensive plan, you start to be able to draw Medicaid funding or Medicaid, you know, the cost that are reimburse costs for specific therapies that actually, you know, add to what that family ends up getting and is not born by the court or the state separately, then just the kids insurance and making sure that they're getting what they need. I think what Cal and Amitsee are doing with HRSA to make sure that, you know, that the workforce for people to coordinate that care and draw that care together is very important, but it really has a multiplier effect. So I think that's one very hopeful thing about the fiscal aspect of this and this is what we saw over and over again with hundreds of cases in the program that was for 10 years in St. Louis and still going strong. The other thing I wanted to mention is that back to Amitsee's description of the family and the family court. And I say this for the judges too, is that oftentimes the situation is so overwhelming for everybody. The risks are very high. The concerns are great, the desperation, the exasperation and so forth. And if there's no agency around a hopeful plan for communication, for reunification, in other words, this is what we must do to get to a place where a safe reunification can occur. A lot of times, just like any clinical problem or any problem in any aspect of life or government or whatever, you have to have a strategy. You have to have goal posts and milestones for how are you going to get home safe? And I think what happens in the Safe Baby Court model is really the elaboration of a plan that instead of that converts the situation from hopeless and bewildering to well, if this were to happen and that were to happen and we saw this many visits and this was kind of successes and progress occurred, then this means it's safe to go back home. And that is what really over and over again within the court situation and within the convergence of clinicians, court personnel and so forth, a plan, a strategy. Sometimes it gets lost in translation of what is this really all about? And it's one thing to see quilts in the courtroom and stuff, which is awesome. Don't get me wrong, I love that. But it's also about hope and the generation of an actual plan and strategy to get back home and be safe. So this is part of this program. And again, it doesn't cost a lot. It's a matter of putting that money and letting it catalyze out those kind of results. And if I may just really quickly lift up some cross-agency collaboration on that first piece that you were talking about around the coordinator is bringing together this care and some of this care is mental health services. And we talked about the intergenerational trauma that's happened, you know, thinking about the third generation of children in foster care. And so these mental health services are really aimed at addressing the parents trauma as well as the child's trauma. And the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities, Wendy White Tigreen, the Department of Community Health and the Department of Early Care and Learning, as well as a number of other organizations, came together to create billing guidance for mental health clinicians, specifically around billing for mental health services for children under the age of five. Because that was something that came out of a study committee a few years ago, chaired by Representative Katie Dempsey, that there was this concern that they couldn't bill for children under five. And so we now have billing guidance that's housed on Medicaid's website, really assuring clinicians that they can bill. So we've done a lot of work this cross agency collaborative work to really ensure that we have the foundation on which infant holder courts can sit around access to mental health services for these families. And that has really involved a huge effort from all of our child serving state agencies. And the role that we play, settlement cannot be overstated because if you look, you know, we heard from a prior presentation too, the proportion of these situations, especially for young children, when the cause of the disruption of appropriate caregiving and surveillance of a young child, young children solicit a lot of caregiving behavior. But when that breaks down, oftentimes it's because of either mental health conditions, developmental disabilities, or a huge proportion of substance use disorders that are untreated in parents. And so the relevance of that is so important to this whole access and how we address that as a principal cause for a lot of this, what you're seeing in terms of prevalence for these situations. And we have a couple of other documents. If it's okay to share them that are from the Safe Babies approach from zero to three, as well as from the training partner of the infant holder courts, which is our Georgia Association of Infant Mental Health, which again came out of that study committee that representative Densy chaired and is also housed at Georgia State University. And that has some of the milestones for young children because a lot of us still kind of think of young children as not having mental health. But what we know is that very young children, what's happening around them and their relationships is impacting their mental health, not only in early childhood, but lifelong. So we really like to think about the development of young children as integral to the infant holder courts because recognizing those developmental stages is really important for those who are working with young children. So if you'd like to give this to Skyshell distribute them to the committee and we're going to keep moving. We've got two more presentations before we break for lunch, Brian Russell from Chalkhont. And then after that, Carrie Nellis. Good morning. Thank you for having me. A lot of things that we talked about this morning, which prevention, which actually fell right in place for us. Chalkhont is a child placing agency that we place kids who are medically fragile in foster care. We take all children, but that's what we specialize. 60% of our children in our foster homes are medically fragile. And doing this work, we recognize that 35 to 40% of the medically fragile kids who are in foster care could have been prevented. And so we came up with a program designed. It's called take charge, our medically based parenting program. And with that program, it is designed to work with families to keep children who are at risk of coming in the foster care who are medically fragile. So those children are often referred to us from children's health care as well as defects. And so what we do is we work in a component of where this family is at. Oftentimes the program or the families feel like there's something wrong with the family, but there's so many dynamics that go along with it. And so we make it a referral from children saying, Hey, mom has missed multiple appointments. And so we go and see what's going on and take up bottom down to top approach in regards to what's going on with that family. So we place a social worker as well as a nurse in the home with the family to figure out what are the dynamics. Mom might be missing the appointments because she has two other children. And they keep schedule an appointment at three o'clock, but she has to be home and get the other children off the bus. And so or it may be a issue of transportation where mom has to be at a particular place for the bus to pick her up at six o'clock in the morning for an appointment. That's at nine o'clock. And then she's there all day and have to wait for certain transportation to go back home to get the other kids. So we look at the whole family dynamic to figure out what's going on with this family. And can they be taught what's the need of taking care to child. So we break it down in the four components. Child bonding, you know, does that parent understand their connection to their child? Child well-being, does the parent understand the wholeness of that child's diagnoses that he has or she may have? Parents sustainability, you know, what once we're out of the program, we try to make sure that this mom becomes able to sustain. And then last but not least, family stability, a sustainability. And this is where, you know, we often say as the professionals, we have trouble navigating the systems of trying to figure out where do I go for this, what do I do for that. And so our ultimate goal is when a family steps away from us, they can be their own case manager and care coordinator. And from that, we also are teaching the parents to become leaders and teachers of other parents who may be dealing with the same situation that they have. And so our ultimate goal is to keep these children from coming in the foster care. I have over 30 years of foster care experience. I worked 15 years in Fulton County. So I understand the dynamics of especially when a medically fragile child comes in the care. It is very difficult for that child to be returned home to the family. And so we do have some families where we do from the reunification standpoint, allow our nurse and our social worker to go in there and see if we can solidify that family home so a child can be reunified. And so we were one of five agencies who are we are HRSA funded at this moment. And we're the only community-based program that got the funding. All the other four programs are universities that do research and different things of that sort. And so we're also looking at the social determinants. What else is factoring in to the family and being able to use that data to help support other programs in the future that can prevent children from coming in the foster care. Thank you. I had a couple questions. I love the concept of teaching the parents how to be a case.\n\nmanager that seems like a very important concept. You guys have been operating for how long and can you get us some outcomes data for the committee at some point? Yes we can. Child Kind has been in business doing foster care since 1989. We did some research probably back around 2015 where we looked at there was a dramatic decrease in medical Medicaid claims as well as hospitalizations for the families who had gone through the program in the past. We've had the program run in probably about 10 years we had to stop because of funding with the program and so we're hoping with a lot of the things with family first and different things that are going on with the division that will be able to secure more funding after our grant is up in three years. Thank you very much questions. So the children and the families are identified because they're in foster care or is it possible to identify the families I guess at birth? Yeah that would seem to be. So our families for this program are identified before they enter foster care. So we're trying to prevent them from coming in the care and the majority of our referrals come from children's and health care and the division of family and children's services reaching out to us and saying hey we have a family can you guys work with them to keep these children from coming in the care? And Brian? In those situations of getting those referrals what's the rate for the prevention of entry into foster care versus you know what you're trying to prevent versus you know so we just started in the second year of the program. Okay so the first year we serve as 24 families and out of those 24 only one CPS referral had to be made. Fabulous yeah that's I mean that's really what you want and and and the have you had trouble with you know getting children's or the Department of Family and Children's Services to get up front on those referrals and make those referrals or do you have more referrals than you can handle? Right now we probably have more than we can handle and we are looking to expand the program to be able to serve as more families. Yeah if you have more than you can handle it makes it possible actually to do a quick you know kind of comparison of the ones that you get referred but you can't reach and how many of those are entering you know into foster care or you know de-fact referrals so maybe there's a natural data analysis out there somewhere would would be really wonderful to kind of just shore that up and it's like a wait list control study basically but if there is a way to kind of get hands on that that might be very influential in in kind of bolstering the case for getting out in front of these these conditions I I have really applauded the effort because medically fragile children you know precipitate these kinds of just immense pressures on families and supporting them is you know it's really what what we need to get them to function so thank you I think they're Dr. Constantine O'Montag just volunteer to help you with that yes thank you thank you very much thank you okay and our last presentation for lunch Keri Nellis from inviting love adoptions come on up and the commissioner is going to join her we'll share the mic thank you so much I appreciate it I know that y'all are hungry I am hungry and so I'm sure that y'all are warning to get to lunch so I appreciate your time I'm honored to be sitting here with commissioner and Bryce to be talking about this issue hopefully you have the brief that I included I know that today's topic is mostly about foster care and next month y'all will be in Columbus talking about adoption but I appreciate you hearing me today because I'm going on vacation and so I will not be here for that and so I'm excited to be here today I wanted to present to you I am an attorney I've been practicing law since 2005 I'm exclusively an adoption attorney I cut my teeth as an attorney in juvenile court representing parents against defects and around that time I saw how open adoption was becoming something specifically in Georgia and it was an opportunity for parents to really have a voice in that I really changed my whole practice and exclusively went to adoption law what I saw and what I have seen over the last 16 17 goodness almost 18 years I'm getting old as an adoption attorney is a progression where we are becoming more and more transactional I'm not talking about foster care adoption I'm talking about private adoptions through adoption agencies and adoption attorneys just to kind of give a little bit of feedback the old school model of adoptions with adoption agencies would be where an expectant mother who was considering making an adoption plan would come to a local adoption agency and she would say I want to make an adoption plan and they would say great these are the families that we have within the agency that our home study ready who you can either you pick through or truly traditional the adoption agency would pick to be honest the adopt prospective adoptive parents would come to the same agency they would say hey I want to adopt a child they would say great let's get a home study done pay me $10,000 $15,000 to sit on a waning list and they would wait for that expectant mom to come and either the mother choose them or the agency the internet blew this model out of the water that is not the traditional model anymore we have adoption agencies in Utah and in New York and in Florida and in all these different states working with mothers in the state of Georgia they're not licensed in the state of Georgia and I stand before you today as an attorney who has been a part of this because when I started as an adoption attorney what I did is I got hired by these adoption agencies and they would hire me and they would pay me $5,000 to walk into a hospital and I thought I was doing good work by getting her to sign surrenders and you know what happened over and over I walked into the hospital room and I was the first person this woman had ever seen in person regarding her adoption let that sink in all interaction with the agency was over the internet they fed x to her profile books they would any no there was nobody sitting there at a waffle house or sitting in her in front of her saying these are the local resources in front of you to to help you to parent or these are other options outside of adoption nobody had shared with her the other options instead all she was supposed to do was call them once not when she got in labor so that someone could be there with her but when the baby was born and it was time for the adopt parents to come and pick up that baby I'm ashamed that I was a part of that and I made the mistake of saying to the Lord hey he really should change that and so today I stand as the executive director of a Biting Love adoption agency we got licensed in 2016 and we are licensed in Georgia Florida and South Carolina at this point and I wanted an agency that centered around the mother no offense to the adoptive parents but they no one was talking about the woman in the corner crying and I wanted an agency that focused around her so I give you that history because I want you to see what's going on in reality in Georgia what is happening is adoption agencies outside of the state are working with mothers they're advertising in the state of Georgia which y'all have already put into our code is illegal and I have showed we have had meetings and I have showed where it shows on the advertisement on Google advertisement where it says AD at the top that means they paid for that advertisement a typical adoption agency pays $10,000 a month in Google ads an agency like mine which is a small agency cannot afford the clicks it cost about $250 per click for me to be able to advertise on Google a licensed Georgia adoption agency so I've given up or even doing that because they've already bought all of that space so they're reaching working with moms and then what happens is they are getting attorneys in the state of Georgia to essentially convert this into a private adoption so what happens is instead of the surrenders and an agency adoption under OCGA 1984 the adoption should be the surrender should be signed from the birth mother the expectant mom to the agency and then the agency places with the family that the mother has chosen instead what they're doing is they're converting it to a private adoption attorney adoption so the surrenders are signed from the expectant mother to the adopt parents and we have agencies and attorneys in the state that are saying this is completely legal if it was completely legal then why wouldn't they be signing it the surrenders under 1984 and putting the adoption agencies name in it because they're not licensed in Georgia. Y'all have put in provisions under the regulations and the DHS regulations and regulation 299-2-0-2 there is a provision for out-of-state adoption agencies to register with DHS and they have to register that they're working with a mother they have to register that they have associated in a licensed Georgia adoption agency and so that the state can then oversee this and I've asked Ms. Barca recently and I don't know if it's changed I'll put you on the spot you're welcome but has anybody registered with that? No and so that's something that we have been looking at in our practices you know many people don't realize that the department of human services although you know we have defects and we do you know adoptions for children that come out of foster care the agency is a whole also regulates child placing agencies which includes adoption agencies and we also oversee the process for the interstate compact replacement of children so if you have kids crossing state lines you know either through the foster care system as the national foster care system or you're talking about adoptions we also know about that we're supposed to know about that we look at the paperwork and make sure everything is is appropriate before child is moved across state lines and then you know lastly we all my agency also has the statewide adoption registry so if you are adopted and later in life you want to try to find out more information about your family then you you have that avenue through R so I can tell you you know working with her this is why I thought it was so good that she actually get the chance to talk to you I can see it with my own eyes now that I'm looking at the these this paperwork that what she's describing is happening and so we're trying to change our practices but she's right it we have a gap here when we're talking about out of state entities working with Georgia moms and Georgia babies for adoption so just quick questions so if it's already illegal what's happening oh how do you fix that I mean we're seeing for some if you don't know about it right well and that's that's what I want to get into in the solutions before I get to the solutions another issue that we're having is that mothers Georgia mothers are being flown out of state to other states to give birth there is an adoption agency in Utah that I have worked with or not worked with but encountered over and over and it happened this year in April this year I got a phone call from an adoptive parent that we did it a placement with through another situation and she said and Kiri I'm confused because something is going on that does not seem legal and what she told me is she had a placement so she has adopted three children the first child was through abiding love the second child was through this Utah agency the mom is from Georgia and they flew her to Utah to live in a compound they make it look like it's the Shangri-La they get their own apartment they get a pool they have a fitness center all this stuff they stay there for nine months if they do not place for adoption they have to find their own way home after they sign the documents and the doctor has cleared them to fly then they will fly them home so we had a mom and in Georgia that she flew to that the Utah flutes there she stayed there the whole nine months she decided not to place and so she had to find her way home with her newborn to Georgia she did she came here in Georgia for a home month and tried to parent she said she called the agency after a month is that I can't parent I don't know how to do this this isn't working so the agency solution was to get a plane first class plane ticket she showed it to me for for Delta for the next day from Atlanta to Utah for her and her newborn they were going to meet her in the airport in Salt Lake City for her to sign the legal documents and then put her in a plane 30 minutes later by herself to come back to Georgia the adoptive parent who had placed with she they had had a placement with us the first time said something doesn't seem right so she called me because she knew I was a Georgia adoption attorney and I said because none of this is right she didn't understand her rights under Georgia law she didn't understand the right that she has a four day revocation period she doesn't understand the right that she has an enforceable post adoption contact agreement and so this is an example of this happening another example is in June of 2021 I got a phone call from my social worker in Houston at a hospital she had a mother who could not speak any English she was from Georgia who had been moved from Lawrenceville Georgia to Houston to give birth she the social worker said that she felt like something wasn't right at the hospital the agency so she she told the agency to leave and she spoke with the mother the mother told her that the agency told her she didn't sign they were going to report her to ICE she's illegal and she did not want to place for adoption they contacted an organization that had come in and done training about predatory practices of agencies and so they got my number as an Georgia adoption attorney I was able to get her home she was so scandalized and scared to come home that she came by bus for three days from Houston and I picked her up here at the at the bus station with a newborn a one year old by herself it took her three days to get from Houston here she was so afraid to fly because they had told her that they would call ICE so these are the things that are happening to your your point chairman krapatric the solutions I would ask that what we need to do is we need to codify regulation 299-2-.02 which is in the DHS rules and regulations for child placing agencies unfortunately because it is not in the Georgia statues a lot of adoption attorneys don't know about it and this is a way to put adoption attorneys or notice about this and it's also a way to be able to give more teeth when I have sat down with the solicitor general's office and I have sat down with with DHS they have said that yes there are statutes in place but they don't feel that they have enough teeth in order to actually pursue it so making sure that that rule stating that agencies have to register and put it in it under the code will give that more teeth the next thing is is while we have in our code for a 1988-16 report that has to be done in a 1985 a 1985 is a third party adoption that's not an agency this report unfortunately is very confused with the home study I often am having to educate when I have judges who appoint a social worker or an agency to conduct a 1988-16 report that this is not a many home study like they think it is what they're supposed to do is to take the petition for adoption and verify it make sure that all the allegations are true and correct by the time we get to them being appointed and actually doing this the birth mom is long gone and a lot of times she's not she's already changed her number two or three times they can't get in touch with her so a better practice as I'm recommending is for the court is for the state of Georgia to require that a birth mother narrative be part of the petition for adoption and for that to be part of the ICPC packet which I know is something that um uh commissioner is working on the birth mother narrative needs to detail exactly how specifically how the birth mother and the adoptive parents were connected this will then let us know if an out-of-state agency has been involved illegally and then we can make sure that we can act appropriately on that the other than it also the birth mother report needs to talk about that she is of sound mind that no fraud occurred in any form um that provide again the specifics as to how they were matched and connected um also detailing the birth mother expenses there the these out-of-state agencies are wiring birth mothers thousands of pounds thousands of dollars they're wiring them and then they're getting the attorney involved and y'all have already put in the code that any birth mother expenses have to go from either an agency to the birth mom or an attorney's trust account but what about before they even got the attorney involved and they've already wired money we had a mom that we served um in savanna um she placed through abiding love and uh then a couple about a year later called me and she said i'm pregnant and i want to place again we spent some large time counseling and talking her question to me and we sat there at waffle house in savanna Georgia and she said how much are you going to give me and i said excuse me and she said i have an agency in in New York that has said that they will wire me a five hundred dollar allowance every week and you didn't do that last time when i placed with you so why what are you going to give me with this and i said ma'am i'm sorry but we're the wrong agency a that's illegal and b um that's not how we practice and so i was very surprised then uh three months later to find out she called me and she said hey i went with that agency and there's an attorney um who is coming to meet with me and i just wanted to ask uh to go over the surrenders i wanted to ask if you knew him and i did and i was very sad that it was one of my mentors and they i asked i went to the mentor and i said why are you doing this she's been wired money and i was told to stay out of it the other thing we need to do in the birth mother narrative is to make sure that mothers know about the enforceable post adoption contact agreement this is a little bit off topic but i want to make sure it's in here i love i'm sitting here before y'all to say i love that george along includes two amazing things one is a four day revocation period where mom can go home and make sure this is the right decision for her and she was not being coerced i also were licensed in salkyre line in salkyre line a mom can sign at 24 hours and it's irrevocable in florida were licensed in a mom can sign at 48 hours or the day of discharge whichever it's irrevocable and many times they go home and and wish that they had never made that decision i love george a law about that the other thing i love about george a law is that we have an enforceable post adoption contact agreement and i love that george is one of the few states in the country that does that and i announced that every day when i speak across the country how proud i am of our state that i am sad to say that birth moms don't know about this i work with other i talked with other attorneys for agencies and i ask them why are you not telling your moms about this well i feel like it could be coercive um it's in the code ocga 19a 27 how is that coercive the language of to what has to be in there so i would ask that that also be included in there the other thing is to incorporate an adoption disclosure in my brief i gave an example of what's used in florida and i would ask that y'all look at this disclosure in the disclosure it shows the mom's rights yes and george right now the attorney rights in affidavit and the attorney writes nafta david saying that she is signing this under no duress she understands exactly what she's doing but again the attorney is representing the perspective adoptive parents or the attorney is representing the agency and even though moms have the right to an attorney let me tell you and i beg my mom's every time to take us up or having an attorney i would say 75% of the time they they wade that even though i beg them to have their own attorney we will pay for it and we will get that for them and so the adoption disclosure is something the mom the birth parent has to sign saying she knows that she has the right um to her own attorney and yes that is included in our surrender um but this is an extra precaution with that but also saying that she understands she has the right to not make an adoption plan that she can look at other resources it talks it needs to have in there about the post adoption contact agreement um so that is another safe um a safe way of doing that i another way to protect moms is a lot of times these out-of-state agencies are having them waive Georgia law because they want them to be more adoption friendly states see Georgia because of our we used to be because of our 10 day and now four day revocation we're not seen as a Georgia adoption friendly state because the way they define a Georgia friendly adoption state is by how it benefits the perspective adoptive parents and so that's why you talk in these other states florida um south carolina um they want them to use their laws where she signs and it's irrevocable so i am suggesting that if there is a waiver of law signed by the birth mother that it is mandated she has to have her own attorney to make sure she understands the law that she is waiving and her rights here in Georgia that she is waiving another suggestion that i'm making is going is a very controversial one and one that my fellow adoption attorneys will not like um but it is something to provide um safe care is to make Georgia an agency only state where only adoptions can be done through agencies you know it was much easier for me to just be an adoption you know why because no one ever walked into my office on a yearly basis to look through every one of my files the Georgia bars a guv self governing organization they only do that when there's a bar complaint i love the fact that this week that's probably going to happen this week but this week um a Siri who was believe it or not she is actually the name of our auditor in our area her name is Siri and she does not like the joke of when i asked Siri when Siri is coming but she will be walking in my office sometime this week to look through all of our files it's a lot of work to make sure all of our files are in place but you know what it's worth it because the mom is worth it and the child is worth it to make sure that everything is being done every tea is being crossed every eye is being dotted and so by making Georgia an agency only state that would allow for the oversight to be done yes with an attorney adoption we have the courts and they are supposed to be providing that oversight but let's be honest the courts are not always up to date or what all of these things entail they are looking at the letter of the law they aren't understanding that we've got to be looking at how's the mother connected how was the match done how was the birth mother expenses done it's a very scary thing that the only reason that you can overturn an adoption in the Georgia state of Georgia past six months is for fraud or duress that's a scary thing and so we're talking about uprooting children's lives and that's why I do love the fact that even though it's a lot of work if I'm saying that on the record it's a lot of work but that we do have that oversight to make sure an accountability in our part to make sure that we're doing those things right we're following those regulations and we're following those state statutes another thing I'm recommending is to give more power to the attorney general's office and the solicitor general's office to criminally prosecute out of state agencies out of state attorneys and adoption facilitators who are working with Georgia I suggest in my brief a tolling fee fine from the day that they start working with the mother and they don't immediately register with the state of Georgia to the date that it is you know discovered or however I think that that would really start scaring out of state agencies facilitators and attorneys from praying or in Georgia mothers the other thing and I did not mention this and honestly I came up with it while I was sitting here but looking at OCGA 19824 subsection A1 and then A2 where this is the section where we talk about the consequences of states of agencies and so forth working with mothers I would suggest that we clarify the language there it says child placing agency I would I would suggest to clarify that to say a Georgia licensed child placing agency I think that in itself also just makes it very clear to adoption agencies and adoption attorneys outside of Georgia and facilitators that they that is illegal it's confusing because in our rev our new revision that we've had in 2018 under OCGA 198 for it does talk about out of state adoption agencies but the reason you all included that is because we have where you can register with DHS but that bridge has not been made in the code and we need to make that bridge to make it abundantly clear over and over I'm on the scam boards on Facebook and other places where I'm seeing moms I'm seeing agencies that are not in Georgia and they have like 10 or 15 moms that they're working with and they'll have the state and where they're due and where they're due due date is and you know they're saying you know as anybody working in with these moms for fraud and I'll message them you know as an agency I'm not trying to drum up business I'm busy I don't need to but I'm sitting there messaging them hey are you you know licensed in Georgia now are you working with an agency that is licensed in Georgia no why would I need to do that have you registered with the state with DHS why would I need to do that I have an attorney in Georgia and they told me everything's fine over and over I get this and I sit here before you to say that birth moms in Georgia and adoptees deserve to make sure that we are holding our adoption professionals accountable and we need to protect them because birth moms are being preyed upon in the state of Georgia and they're at a very vulnerable place and so I hope that you can take these suggestions and in ways that we can strengthen the adoption code in order to protect them. Did you even want to comment on the questions from the committee? Well thank you for coming early because our next meeting is focused on adoption but this is important information and it's going to take us some time to digest it so I really appreciate your your accommodate our schedule to be here with us today. Thank you. Thank you. It's 12.30 and we're going to break for lunch we do have a number of people to testifying after lunch so we really need to start back about 10 after 1 and for the committee and staff there's lunch in room 328 and for anyone else that needs to grab something to eat there is a cafeteria around the corner on Washington Street and they're usually pretty quick so we'll see everybody back at 10 after 1. Thank you.\n\nIt was close it somehow you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you\n\nyou you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you I know to voice and Worsley, I want to step up. And you've got some information. I do. That was passed out. Thank you for having me today. My name is Susan Worsley. I'm the executive director of the North Georgia Angel House in Canton. I have been working with foster care kids now for about 32 years. Came out of the military and found, you know, we have some similarities for sure, you know, military, we had a billet number. That was our name, you know, when you go through basic training, you get a number. And I sometimes feel working in the foster care system or kids feel a little bit the same. Out of necessity, you know, we're trying to process large volumes of kids all the time. In the years that I worked in investigations, removing kids, I've seen that side of it, trying to get a kid out of the house when the family's crying and everybody's carrying on. It's tough to try and get birth certificate, social security cards, eyeglasses, prescription meds, teddy bears, all these things that have to happen at once. It can be a little bit chaotic. So, you know, what I have found over the years, though, when that chaos ends and kids enter the foster care system, a lot of times it's very hard for the dust to ever settle as a result of that. So the kids are still kind of clinging to where they came from and really their identity is a big piece of that, you know, they often, they want to talk to their parents, they can't. There's many reasons for that a lot of times. But one of the things I think that we can equip our kids with is in, is just a state ID. There's a couple of house bills that have passed in some of our neighboring states that I've given to you in your packets and, you know, other states are facing the same problems that we are. It's not specific to Georgia. It's just one of those things that plugs the foster care system in general. But, you know, working with the population, I've given you some brochures from my organization. We serve a lot of teenage kids. And those kids are trying to find a job and enter the workforce and move forward. And without having a birth certificate in order to get an ID, it becomes problematic. So a lot of times, you know, I think about when I pass through the lobby downstairs and they ask for my driver's license, we need to know who we're working with. And for young people, when we're removing them, a lot of times, you know, it's, it's so crisis driven where every kid in the house is coming into care. We're later trying to sort out whose kids do we have. And we get to a shelter and a rainman in a disposition. But some of the other neighboring states that I see are asking that within 90 days when kids come into care that we equip these kids with an ID. So that they're not traveling with their birth certificate and social security card. We can vet that at the state office or someone could. Other states are using a third party to do that. But then our kids have the necessary credentials that they need to go and find a job, get a driver's license and the things that they need to legitimate their stay while they're in foster care. Long many years ago, we had a kid when I was working in Miami that got hit by a car. A kid had been living in our group home for a long time and he was a really good kid. And we never heard the kid's name. And I was washing the dishes one night and I saw the kid's face come up on the news and said, hey, if you know this person call us and I call the hospital at our general and they had one of our kids there. I thought was one of our kids. He was in his 30s and he had been, he was a not from the states, but Creole was his native language. And when he got hit by a car, he could no longer speak English. People couldn't communicate with him. And I went to see him and they had done a bone scan just during the trauma to find out what was injured and they determined from his bone scan his age. He was in his 30s. So we wondered later why he was such a great teenager. Well, because he was approaching middle age. So there you have it. So, you know, there's just all kinds of reasons for us to kind of want to come together and just give kids a tool. We take so much from them when we bring them into care. And it's just kind of nice for them as they're floating through the system to have something they don't have a my chart, a place they can log in and have access to their medication or their parents contact or their case managers or even to ask a question of someone that can answer right away. We're all in such a state of crisis all the time. So that would be my ask today would be if we could somehow kind of follow suit with Arizona and Texas and look at some of their legislation that's just recently passed and see if we might be able to find a way to give our kids that are in care once they are at least 14 when they're approaching and they're in dependent living years. And we're now giving those kids a service plan if we could not equip them with this ID. That was short and sweet. Can you just tell us what the typical cost would be? Yeah, so right now it's $5 in Georgia if you're indigent and that's pretty easy. A shelter order should do that. One of the things I often see for kids that are in care that a lot of times kids are kind of in legal limbo. They're not yet freed for adoption but they are in the foster care system. Many times those were kind of conflicting we need a signature to get things records. For example, to get a driver's test for just routine type things that most of us would take our own kids for. We need a parent's signature. So that cost would be $32 if they walked in off the street, $5 if they're in foster care. So it's not a huge cost. We just need to somehow make the process pretty smooth. My suggestion would be a shelter order that once we have a shelter order that's brought kids into care, that that's stand in place of a parent's signature I could be able to use that shelter order, go to the driver's license office, we would give those kids a voucher for the $5 they'd come out with a state ID and they will lose it over time. We expect that. It'll be another $5 but that's fine. That seems like a very sensible thing that can help a lot of people. And a lot of times it's the little things that get in the way of being independent. So any questions from the committee? Senator Payne. So I'm a kids do you have? We have up to 40 on our campus. And our kids are 12 all the way to 21. And mostly defects kids, some are DJ kids. But you know, the kids that we have, usually it's our older kids, you know, the kids, my program is more like a group home. So these are older kids that have been kind of pushed around from place to place. And what they really want now is a job. And they want to be able to kind of forge their path and we want that for them. And when they're just sitting in the home frustrated because they can't get a job because they don't have an ID, it just compounds the problems and leads to placement disruptions and many things I think we could probably prevent. Well, thank you. You're welcome. Well, Susan, that is a fantastic idea. Thank you for bringing that forward. I completely agree with you. It's a significant challenge. When a youth does not have an ID to get the birth certificate to go through the process of getting even to sometimes find so security cards. So to do that, have them ready. I think it's a wonderful thing. What would you say? You know, you've looked at some of the other state practices. You're saying once they get enough permanent placement or some kind of at least placement for 90 days within 90 days. What kind of legislation is there a model legislation that other states are using? Is it put into policy in other places? How does that get work done? Yeah, there is. There's actually two states that I found. And I put a little bit. I printed the packets for you guys. I think it's a little bit more difficult to find. But there is. There was an Arizona. There was a house bill 2588 that was signed last month. It will take effect on this September through October. And that's kids that are 16 to 17 for them to. They can apply for a state ID just because they're in foster care. So it looks like the. The hard work and heavy lifting has already been done there. In Texas is the other state that. You know, defects. When kids come into care after 90 days. I think that. I think that. That's good. For the I.D's. Understanding. And I came from the default system in Miami. So I understand turnover. But one solution. I would say is let the provider. We have kids. We have more time than those guys do. And let us do it. We are happy to take them. If we have the right document. We. I just personally happened to think every kid that comes into care. for us to use that to say, hey, we've detained your child. Can we have this ID so that they can move forward? Thank you. You're welcome. I noticed in one of the examples that talked about how the child who was a teenager, I guess, didn't really know her name, didn't know her parents' names. Yeah, I mean, that's super challenging. When you get a shelter order, I don't know if there's a birth certificate or is there some kind of, I guess, describe the challenges you have we're getting a birth certificate or finding out what the child's name is. You know, we have a kid in our program now and I feel pretty often. Kids come in and when they're removed, it's what we think, right? We're in crisis and then later information develops as it would. And then, you know, so we have shelter, the emergency shelter hearing, then we have an arrangement, then we have a disposition. By the time we get to disposition, hopefully all those documents match. Many times they don't. We have kids here from out of state. We're a pretty transient place. Really no different than Florida to be honest. We're growing in that sense. But I think that one of the challenges, for example, this young person that came in that that didn't know her name a lot of times, we meet kids whose parents have told them that you're Aunt Dolly. And, you know, we'll look at a call sheet and somebody we think is Aunt Dolly is really the neighbor. It's not even, you know, so, you know, a lot of times kids don't really know. Sometimes it's just a term, you know, that's, we hear that's my baby's mama all the time. We're like, who's that? And it's really not, you know, it's just things you'll learn along the way. So, you know, for them, it would just be nice for them to really know who they are. Their last name, you know, the kid that I'm talking about right now, we went to get her credentials. She has three last names. We're like, which of the three? A lot of times they're birth certificate. It's just not available. Vital statistics can provide those in Georgia. It's pretty easy system that's already in place. We just have not streamlined that process so that we could easily get that. And then we need a secondary system to address kids that are not born in this state and in the country. Those are all very different issues. Kids out of the country, pretty challenging. You're welcome. So, Sarah. A 14 year old comes into that's in foster care, comes into a medical office, let's say. And doesn't have that yet. What should the health provider be doing or how could they be like, you know, kind of champion in these, this cause? I mean, is it, is this an open pathway to just, you know, doing that for any, it should that be part of a, you know, kind of strategy for health visits for these kids? It would be amazing. Yeah. You know, their Medicaid number is often unknown to us. The provider can go into the portal and determine what a child's Medicaid number is and whether it's active or whether status is. Right. If parents have secondary insurance, it falls, you know, that creates another medical issue that Medicaid won't pick up until the first insurance satisfies that debt. And there's some, you know, things that happen there. What, what I would say though is that an ID, it tells the provider when the child shows up with an ID, he and foster care. Right. So a lot of times we can provide a temporary letter to a provider to say this kid is in foster care. Payment is forthcoming. Their Medicaid has not yet been activated. But there is a Rev Max unit in every county that looks to address that for kids that are in foster care when they come in. Their case goes to Rev Max, which will open their eligibility for Medicaid. There's emergency Medicaid and different things that come from that. Right. But to answer your question, yes, in a perfect world, their ID would have their Medicaid number on it. So that they would never have their gold card. I were asked all the time, can you send their insurance card? I've never seen an insurance card. I've been here for 18 years. I've never seen one. Right. So. All right. It's just the transient nature, really, of our population. It's really so hard. Thank you. Welcome. Other questions? Very helpful. Thank you so much. Okay. Sarah, one or grad together families. I have group here too and I'll introduce them. So excited to have them with me. Maybe, Hayley, you can, McKinney, you can sit here and then Hayley here and then you'll come out. So I'm going to share my time with two people that I think.\n\nwould be very helpful for this committee as you're deciding on some very important issues. This is Nikita Rapper. She's a former de-fax investigator. Haley Mico is an 18-year-old. She just 19 year in the graduated high school on her way to college and her seven siblings are right now in Georgia's foster care system. So I am very honored to be here and I appreciate I don't take this lightly. I speak on behalf of Georgia's families who are struggling with poverty, vulnerable families who are impacted by the systems we create right here. So I'm going to start with a little bit of a story for you all to give you a little picture of what I see every single day. The day remains etched in my memory as it happened yesterday. It was close to five years ago when I was handed a plain manila folder, a case that would profoundly alter the course of my life. At the time I had recently taken on the role of a court appointed special advocate in Cobb County. My journey leading up to this moment was far from ordinary. I was a missionary kid raised in the former suburb of public of Belarus, spending much of my time working alongside my parents and orphanages and assisting with humanitarian aid efforts. Life of luncheon brought me back to Georgia where my husband is now a physician and I am a mom to four incredible children and adoptive parent, a parent and an adult child with a disability and a mom to a daughter who's now a junior at junior at UGA, just such good dogs. I have devoted my entire life as a professional volunteer to serving children, youth and families who are grappling with poverty and other hardships and who are impacted by government systems. Currently I'm the executive director of Together With Families, an newly established nonprofit and in the past five years have worked closely with over 200 families who are impacted by the child welfare system either through investigations or foster care itself and then there was that manila folder. Inside it held the tragic story of a family separated four young boys who had been torn apart and scattered across three different foster homes and during over a year of separation from their mother and the state was teetering on edge of filing to terminate her mother's their mother's rights. I become a casa after seeing you create a foster care system. I worked with them in Lina often they were faced with homelessness and more trauma on the unforgiving streets of Atlanta. I wanted to ensure that every child found the love and permanency of a forever family. As I sat in my car eagerly flipping through a manila folder's contents I was confronted with a disturbing reality. Page after page reveals a family torn apart by an unforgiving system. I began to highlight the document adding question marks to the margins why had we separated this family? Where was the evidence of the kind of abuse or neglect that justified such a drastic measure? I struggled to make sense of it all. I couldn't accept that we had taken these children from their loving mother simply because they lacked adequate housing and resources a problem that could be solved with the right supports. But it was the oldest child who I was most worried about. He was close to his 12th birthday and had moved five times. Walking into his foster home I was nervous but determined. The foster caregiver that's struggling single parent for its been years fostering children spoke about this young man with carlessness that gave me chills. Her words used to disdain the void of love or care and her description of his family for the same harsh tone. Fostering I understood was a calling for some driven by love and compassion. I've learned for others their other various motives some dark sometimes family struggling themselves financial gain or need becoming the driving force. I walked towards the 11 year old boy feeling the weight of my responsibility as I took a seat beside him on the couch he smiled and I returned the gesture then I gently spoke to him hey I'm a critical and special advocate I'm here to help you you could have anything in the world what would it be his response struck me like a gut punch I want to go home and miss my mom I worry about my brothers I want to see them can you help me then ask him to tell me about his family I heard in history a family bond by love but navigating the complexities of living in poverty on Sundays they would come together listening to gospel music as it cleaned the house when they couldn't afford electricity they would huddle together under a blanket all together on one mattress and has the neighbor's fridge upstairs to keep food cold they returned to my car over round with emotions and started to sob couldn't comprehend how such a heart wrenching separation could occur in America this is not the custodian at least that's what I thought how could we meet this family that was experiencing hardship with more hardship instead of the help they needed my next call was to his mother my first conversation we had I think she cussed me out she said do you purpose throw my children you kidnapped them I told them not the division of family and children services my volunteer mom I told her that I'm here to help your children and if it was in her children's best interest to be with her mother then that meant I needed to help her too so I started helping the family reunite as I dove deeper into the case file couldn't ignore the troubling inaccuracies that marked its pages with stark reminder that the truth gets obscured in a labyrinth bureaucracy of the child welfare system that's for today and all four boys are no longer separated from their family and foster care but the drama of family separation lingers they still fear the knocks on the doors and social workers they have learned to isolate and not to seek help because help doesn't always help when dr. DeGrover said three generations of foster care that's how you produce three generations of foster care you teach people that when you help not really gonna help you don't reach out keep your business to yourself and the five years ago before I opened that personal folder I took it oath I was sworn in as a casa quote a point of special advocate I marked on the journey that were forever changed the way I saw foster care I have written this loving family's the working poor in Georgia custodians employees at crore crore crore gore robber FedEx leaving in the grip of a poverty crisis knowing the best to navigate their world where they often can't afford safe housing reliable transportation access to medical care dental care and education facing cps and investigations in their lowest moments when there's no amount treatment and they needed resources community support families facing a fear and it's fear deep rooted fear of being thrown apart unnecessarily years the painful irony we are spending or with $32,000 a year of tax dollars for a child to keep children separated from their families this is for a child with most special needs or serious medical or behavioral issues it can be offered about a hundred thousand a year or more for some children in government care that's staggering cost not just in dollars but in human suffering in the past five years I had upon the privilege of serving over 200 families involved with child welfare system with only family separation for 98% of them family separation isn't an inevitable fate it's usually a preventable trauma but providing transportation child care housing assistance navigation of resources foods food and financial assistance to parents at risk of family separation and engaging relative caregivers and caring when parents can't ensure their children's safety really can avoid the trauma of separation our families face challenges that might resonate with many here they have children with special needs and acute and complex health and behavioral needs they deal with illness and sometimes receive the devastating diagnosis of cancer they experience trauma and they grapple with domestic violence and confront untreated mental mental health conditions like PTSD depression anxiety and can resort to substances as a new new substance used as a desperate coping mechanism these struggles aren't unique family is living in poverty I know they're living in that middle class neighborhood their challenge is that can affect any of us however we typically have the resources and it's a brick to address them without the fear of family separation looming over us it's essential to recognize that 80% of families involved with the child welfare system we've 200 percent the poverty line and 70% of children in Georgia's foster care system eventually return to a parent or relative or a trauma of prolonged family separation I am planning to consider a truth hidden in plain sight it's not only more humane but also more fiscal and responsible to prevent foster care than to continue to pay for it and Georgia we allocate less than 20% of title for around 20% of title for funding towards prevention while the majority of the resources are funneled into the foster care and adoption industry it's an industry instead of the numbers staggering 32,000 per year to keep run child separated from their family and foster care from here to what it has cost us a mere 500 to 1500 for a child in assistance and resources and together with families to prevent foster care and help families improve their own lives but this isn't just about dollars in cents it's about the immense human cost children in foster care we've heard it today but we didn't hear they passed 7% higher mortality rates worst mental health outcomes in children in the general population when and where the government is not good at raising children imagine if we redirected the resources from a foreign foster care system and to prevent it in the first place and ensure that families in Georgia when they're experiencing hardships and poverty and when they're at the most moments we're not done with concrete supports and the help that they need instead of family separation imagine if families had the opportunities and resources they needed to care for their own children this is a bipartisan issue that transcends politics it's a human issue it's about compassion and creating a brighter future for Georgia's children and families prevention is not just the right thing to do it's the cost effective thing to do and here we can show other states that is possible when we work together to keep families together and before I go to questions I'm going to allow Nikita to share her we're not going to have time for questions because we are behind schedule okay so go ahead hey my name is Nikita Raper I am an LMSW and former defax worker people the Michael little short sorry I interned at defax and Douglas CAC and I worked at Cobb County defax for two years about a year and a half under investigations and the rest of that under family preservation I'm here testifying as an individual and do not represent the agency in any way and near miss is what we call a situation that might have been a removal but was somehow prevent it generally these consist of family supports or effective kind have the means to fill gaps for defax and both families ones that could provide care financial assistance in the immediacy as an investigator we generally had a resource packet of about one to two pages but the organization's able to provide flexible funding generally boiled down to about four to six agencies for these families they had to qualify sometimes being able to afford a motel for one to two weeks first they had to catch them between grant cycles and make it through a wait list of thousands of other families often asking for exactly the same things while there is put funding available to defax in order to justify it we have to contact all of those organizations demonstrate this and documentation to our program director so they can pass it up the chain and then funds needed to be cleared and distributed which looks like about two to four weeks realistically as a case manager I want sat with a mother and two toddlers at the ER from 3 p.m. until 11 she had been staying at a motel but lost her job because her car broke down and had applied for caps but needed to demonstrate work hours to qualify she had called defax herself for assistance and despite a caring mother showing protective capacity this was a removal situation finally we were able to get in touch with Sarah together with families and they were able to pay for a motel for a week so we could link to a shelter and and do wraparound services for future prevention this family without an agency with flexible funding would have been one of the cases that came into the juvenile court system without a traditional definition of maltreatment as has already been discussed in August with commissioner brosch and family preservation I encountered so many families who just needed assistance with application fees and rental deposits preventative costs that to state constituents represent so much less than the 32,000 year that Sarah is talking about you know that particularly where the average of Georgia foster care children is 23 months so financial support for effective kin is really limited we often ask families to take on two weeks to a month in child care costs before Georgia Cal decal can be linked we talk about the links to our constituents and the educational piece around accessing these resources but what case managers need on the ground is the means to keep these kids out of care for the time that it takes to implement these systems we're looking to discuss what is within the scope of this committee and I think we need to look at partnerships between agencies to bring multiple systems to the table to support identified families as a must much of this is like the policy model with the child abuse protocol with multi disciplinary meetings between DOE defects DCH and DJJ for all cases that come through child advocacy centers these meetings could be required for prevention and early intervention at the family preservation level with cases that don't necessitate CAC involvement we need to that legislate the designation of flexible funding for investigations and family press with early intervention to allow immediate resources to families we also need to provide funding to organizations like that of Sarah Wintegrad advocates taking phone calls from case managers at 10 o'clock at night thank you this is Hailey Minkl. I'm just the sister my mom is here and I wanted to share a little bit about my story and how it has impacted me basically about how parents are not always at fault when defects is involved so okay so imagine going from being a close-knit family never being away from one another to being separated from each other's arms overnight that's what happened to my family and the pain that it caused not only my mom but me felt horrible seeing my siblings once a week visits getting canceled because the defects workers aren't prepared watching my siblings cry as they have to leave my mom and go home to a stranger seeing my siblings are not getting the proper hygiene care that they need and so much more like many others my family has been tormented pieces by the child welfare system due to struggling with poverty and being in need of immediate help we are a family that pursued through lives triumphs together we love each other deeply and my mom has been the most loving mother who is completely devoted to keeping us safe my mother has always done her best to provide for our large sized family we we leaned on each other and despite our struggles we knew the love and warmth of family you're told when in me it's a call for help and that's exactly what was done but instead of the support we desperately needed we had our lives tremendously turned upside down by the very system designed to assist us two of my siblings were confined to mental hospitals while the rest of my siblings were bounced from foster home to foster facing neglect abuse and emotional trauma by strangers another two two others have even had to sleep in the defects office all seven of my siblings are separated into five different homes today it hurts me to know that we were failed excessively by the ones we called on for a shoulder being here from domestic violence we had no other choice but to call defects the challenges our families faced caring for my two siblings with special needs or my mother losing her job to due to them continuously getting suspended and us getting evicted due to being behind on rent which i landlord extended grace and patience to us greatly but because my mom had an open case with defect she was in that help from agencies that were willing to help us all we needed was an extended helping hand which my mom never asked for because she's a super mom my family story is not the first to be told and there are many others like us who have suffered due to the family division caused by our system family shouldn't be fearful that their children would be a abruptly snatched away due to poverty i'm asking that you consider the impact that your actions and decisions can have on families such as mine to help families prevent being separated by being an option for possible financial support instead of placing and paying for children to be in foster homes as a first resort especially being that it causes great emotional trauma to be separated from parents the child welfare system needs to be a reform needs to be reformed to a system that should be a light of hope and not a source of despair and darkness thank you thank you very much appreciate your passion and your story and your courage for talking to us thank you thank you for this name uh Sarah Alexander good afternoon madam chairperson and members of the committee thank you for allowing me the opportunity to speak today given i am an adoptive mom court appointed special advocate current mentor and formal former educator my focus today is on how we are providing trauma informed care a little over two years ago i received a call from a woman in my community that found in an organization to help churches and community get involved in the story of children and care she wondered if i would be willing to mentor a young lady aged 11 who had entered care and was placed as a residential care facility in our community due to a shortage of foster homes in our area to make a long story short i said yes and i am still walking it out with her today almost three years later i've spent hours on the phone and in the car traveling to see her we have begin together through three upcoming on four placements and just started with her fourth caseworker during her most recent placement which has been about a year a year long placement she's had two health service providers two different counselors and two different classroom teachers the turnover rate is high i've experienced the inner working of facilities been to juvenile court and rung my hands many times over things that just aren't working during this time i have also worked with a relentless kasa and discovered a network of non-profit providers throughout the state that have pointed me toward trauma informed care resources some of these resources are what i want to address and share with you today when i became an adoptive mother of a daughter who had been in a kinship placement some 23 years ago we did not have the brain research that we have now neuroplasticity and uterine trauma are but two of the areas that were not yet understood back in the year 2000 when my daughter was demonstrating language limited language development at age two the pediatrician shrugged his shoulders and reminded me a reading specialist to read to my child i found one neurodevelopmentalist in north Atlanta and attended every session she offered and did everything she said which did help however unconventional at the time well fast forward to 2023 we now have a wealth of research and increase knowledge about the human brain information about aces and quality scientifically validated care giving models are available we have learned that the old rewards consequences model of discipline is not effective especially with children from hard places we know that punishment and punitive evoke at best momentary change with those who have experienced trauma we understand that the body keeps the score when trauma trauma is not addressed and it spills out into increased health care needs and lower productivity of our workforce not to mention a lower quality of life and mental health needs so what do we do i believe we need to make some changes in that we in the way that we deliver care not only to children in the system but across the board not only do i believe this but i'm proud to report that many other well educated knowledgeable and motivated individuals in our great state are working to do this they have done the research and the homework and have a vision to develop a culture of trauma informed care in all sectors of the community that interact with children goals include helping caregivers understand the impact of trauma and to understand when it has occurred they seek to address trauma by incorporating into policy procedure and practices the three pillars of trauma wise education which are felt safety connection and self-regulation skills and to avoid retraumatizing children and families so who are they well their organizations like restoration hope hope collective 1312 and fostering impact that are but three of many organizations leading the charge in Georgia they have sector leads in schools social services courts camps churches and regional representatives in eight different defects regions they are called and committed to this process and summer here today so how do we deliver trauma informed care we need a model that works across all sectors and with all children that's not clinical but can be caregiving so that a caregiver can be trained needs to be holistic and cost effective with tangible strategies and tools and there is such a model some 14 years ago researchers at Texas Christian University began to study the needs of complex children or of children who have experienced abuse abuse neglect and trauma they developed an approach called trust based relationship intervention which is called TBRI which utilizes broadly accepted and scientifically validated practices that addresses all the major issues linked with complex trauma in all caregiving environments from foster homes to residential care homes to schools and to detention centers it works at summer camp in after school programs with trained law enforcement and with medical personnel and it teaches principles of empowerment connection and correction TBRIs being used in Louisiana's residential treatment programs and in their impact training Texas has incorporated TBRI into their DJJ systems with very good results they reported a 93 percent reduction in suicide watches a 31 percent decrease in physical restraints and a 45 percent increase in program completion between 2014 and 2019 this led to a reduction in outside placements saving over $300,000 a year Powell Blau is the president former president of the adoption and foster parent association in Georgia and he's been quoted with saying TBRIs an answer professionals with with in Georgia and other states seem to agree our state recently completed a practitioner training for over 70 participants and has over 100 prior practitioners on the books so that's a total of 170 trained practitioners these practitioners range from LPCs to teachers and advocates and defects workers it is my understanding that we now have our first trained juvenile court judge in Savannah who's working with CESET cases the Rome YMCA is presenting to otherwise on a national level and work as being done at UGA toward getting into title 4E programs hope for the journey is sponsored by an organization called show hope which is a nonprofit located in Tennessee it provides TBRI focused training for parents foster parents caregivers churches and professionals last year over 1,000 Georgians were reached during this through this training when asked for direct feedback defects workers within regions 1 and 3 noted value from TBRI when working with families for preservation foster care situations residential placements as well as with reunifications and adoption and post adoption scenarios foster parents have requested that it be taught during impact training defects workers have suggested establishment of TBRI foster homes that have an initial and ongoing training and support train CPS workers can apply TBRI principles both personally when dealing with their own personal work related trauma and when working with clients so by now you think I'm getting a kickback from the Purvis Institute or that I'm a graduate of TCU will neither is true I'm a passion I'm just passionate about child welfare and as an educator adoptive parent mentoring concerns citizen I want what's best for Georgia's kids and their families and I'm willing to put time and energy into that I wholeheartedly believe that a shift has begun in our care practices that can solve many of the problems in multiple areas having an intervention that utilizes both broadly accepted and scientifically validated practices that can be taught to all caregivers across all sectors creating a common approach and belief structure is what vulnerable children and families need and deserve I met with my mentee this weekend and we talked about how to introduce herself to her new case worker and what she hopes for in her next placement she hopes her next placement is closer to her sisters she's currently a 12 hour transport for a three hour visit and that it allows her to go outside because she really does like listening to the birds and the crickets Miss Sarah she said I know that people are always going to have disagreements but I would really like to live somewhere where people don't yell and fight to try to solve their problems back in 2000 when I was struggling with my daughter's language development we didn't know better now we know better we have resources and can do better so I ask for your support curiosity and willingness to accept change may we all answer the call to provide the best care for Georgia's children and families thank you for your attention and I do have Jennifer Shimpot from fostering impact is here today she's a trained practitioner TBRI practitioner so so a member of the state defects advisory board we're happy if there's no time for questions we can answer questions afterward or whatever's at the will of the committee so thank you so much thank you very much and if you could send us some basic information about TBRI you can send it to me and I'll get it out to you yes and I apologize for not I just had a great thank you so much thank you okay um howdy beggar was not able to come so Amanda Gilling from Grayson Joyhouse I'm Amanda Gilling I'm the founder and director of the Grayson Joyhouse in Dalton, Georgia also an adoptive mom have five siblings two third option we started the Grayson Joyhouse and we opened in September of 2020 so we've been open for three years now we are at\n\ntemporary placement for if CBS can remove the children and come and stay with us until they can find a kinship placement of foster home, group home, whatever it, you know, that might be. They would come in, they eat, they leave with everything they're going to need for the first couple of days. They get new underwear and new socks, new pajamas, toiletries, stoppers, wops, their babies, formula, just whatever they might need. But through our three years of doing this, is that need to go down? Through our three years of doing this, we just keep seeing more and more needs. We see the children come in so quickly, you know, and then we have an excellent relationship with our local department of family and children's services. We started a relationship with them about seven years ago when at the time, Danny Knuckles was our director. We have kept close contact with him that we have a new director. We also are about to open a grocery house in Chotsworth that should be open within about four weeks. But we feel that we need to do more because we feel like we see children bouncing from foster home to foster home. We had twins come through the summer. They were six years old. The little boy had autism, his sister. She may have had autism as well, not as severe as him. They left their that-not knowing that they were just going to a foster home for that one-not because the foster family just agreed to take over that one-not. They were great while they were there with us a few hours later. They go to this foster home two weeks later, one of the foster families in a neighboring county calls and they said, hey, I'm about to get six-year-old twins. This was 15 days later. I said, really? I said, I described them as she said, yeah, I said, are you kidding? We had them 15 days ago. So, coming to find out, they had been in numerous foster families and hotels within that 15 days. Then when I spoke with the supervisor, she said, always been terrible. They have been in so many homes. It's just pitiful. But on that Friday night, when I got that call from that foster mom that I happened to know, she said, this little boy is sitting in my living room with his hands over his ears and he's rocking back and forth. It feels like when you have a child with autism, it's difficult anyway, but for him to have that many changes and that many days, it's like they were saying they were just getting traumatized over and over. It's not de-facts as fall. It's just the way the system is. In Raging 1, we have, didn't bring my phone up here. I had my notes on there. It's like close to 1,300 children in care and we only have 275 homes and that's including kinship placements. So, we just don't have places for our children to go. We are in a process in Raging 1 right now. And we have Phil County when we started three years ago. We had 27 foster families. Today we have 13. We had five group homes. Today we have one. Murray County has three foster families. The county that we're about to open, three foster families for the whole county. So, what we would like to do, what we have sent a proposal actually to the governor's office, we would love to do a receiving. We're calling it like a receiving center where the children could actually come and stay for the first couple of weeks where they could go and get their doctors appointments. They get, we could actually get some all their assessments done because I feel like one thing that's happening when I say these kids moved is that the child has more trauma or more special needs than the family is expecting and they get them and then they're like, oh, this is too hard. This is too much for my family, you know, we can't. So there they go having to find them somewhere else to go. And we're saying that a lot of times we've had several of the same children come through, you know, repaid. We feel like there's a policy that's probably would work for us that's already being used with Governor Camp's Wafs initiatives that we maybe could share some of those policies to start our receiving center. We have a, she was just talking about TBRR. We have the lady that's going to be over our chat's worth location that's works for us. It just became one of those practitioners in Georgia. So I'm also going to, well, let me tell you about one more thing. Wait, this, this Tuesday I had a little girl come that is 16 years old. She has severe epilepsy where she's having at least two or three seizures a day. She has to wear a helmet and she was released from the hospital on Tuesday. She had been in the hospital for a week and she came in a bad inhale. And, and I know there's just, it's so hard, I guess, for all the information to be relayed. But the child was extremely more severe than the foster mother had understood. And I've spent almost every day for a week listening to her cry because the child is so precious and so sweet, but much, much more severe than she expected. And had she understood how severe she was, she probably would not have agreed to take her. And I know that sounds terrible, but it is what it is. And so now she's in a struggle with herself about whether she should keep her or not. So this how may be about to move, because of just the severity of her needs. And we feel like with the Reservant Center, we would be, it would be, you know, trauma based. We would be able to have everything there and do it with complete excellence and extreme accountability. And our thing is if it's, if it's not a place where we would leave our own children, then it's not good enough. And this is Ray Sharra, Ray, I like, you give them your title. Hi, I'm Ray Sharra, I'm a licensed professional counselor in the state of Georgia and also a licensed mayor to family therapist. I've been with Amanda since we started the Grayson Joy houses. But I want to talk a little bit about is our receiving facility kind of are thinking about how it would be ran and the services that we would provide. It would be more wraparound services to partner with all of the inter agencies, department family children services, all the different departments that we're faith based. So we would also partner with the community as we have been doing. But it would just be a place where we all have shared responsibility for the healing of these children. And so we've heard testimony or we've heard research today about so we know what these children have been through, but then we have them and we're continuing to traumatize them every step of the way. So what we would like to do is stop that immediately, bring them into the center. We propose a 12 week program. We understand that that might not be feasible based on the amount of children that come through. We're not stuck on 12 weeks. But what we'd like to do is we'd like to give the children a sense of felt safety to where we can slow the amygdala down so the rest of the brain can come on board and work. We're talking about trauma intervention from day one. We're talking about a psychosocial assessments to talk about education where they are educationally, where they are psychologically and where they are physically. A lot of the times we really don't know about what's going on with these children medically. So those are some of the things that we would like to get a full picture of these children that we're serving. Not only that, what we want to do is we want to partner with the fostering families that they would also be included in this process as we go. If there are children in the foster family, what we would do is we would just train everybody all together and blend the families as we go. There's a lot of interventions that we have to offer. But in one place, if we could have it all in one place 24 hours a day, Devax pulls somebody a child from a family. They don't have to worry about placement. They come and bring it from the moment that child walks in the door. It's trauma informed with all of the policies and practices in place to take care of those children to also take some of the burden off of the systems. If we really look at the systems, they're so overburdened. This facility would allow that to happen so they could find the foster, you know, the right placements. We also partner with some other faith-based agencies who train foster families and they find that they recruit foster families. So we would like for it to look like just everybody taking responsibility that we work in our agency and that we pull on all the resources for, you know, for the welfare of these children so that we'd stop the repeat placements. We stop children coming back into foster care. We would love to work with the families reunifying the families if that's an option and they have a Devax plan. We're going to work within the same because we do believe in all the research. So what we're asking you guys today to consider is that we have some facilities in the state that aren't being used. That would help us that would house this pilot program, this receiving facility. So we're asking you guys to consider maybe like some type of a proposal or some type of a partnership where you would look at us using that facility where, you know, we would have the resources we've applied for a HUD grant for many to either purchase or upgrade any facility that we get well know about that November. Is that right? So we're very excited about it because we look at the long-term statistics and we know if we do it here preventively, if we take the children here already traumatized, start working on their trauma immediately and help them heal, then they have the basis to be able to stabilize and to be able to blend and integrate with the foster families and even with their own parents once we've trained and helped them. So that's what we're about. Questions? Thank you. I think you've got a good advocate here sitting next to me. Did you want to say anything about that? I wonder who that could be. I have been working with Amanda and just then we've been working on a lot of this and somebody who has worked in the juvenile courts for 30 years and seeing those kids and so many occasions that would come, they got a juvenile justice charge because of the trauma that they experienced because of no false of their own and then they come in the court system with their one charge they might last be on under my supervision for just three months and then they'd get off but then they'd come back a year later now they're on their third fourth foster home and they're 110% worse and just as I saw that time and time again so when Amanda brought this to me this is something I just thought we really needed to look at and just you know the community, I think it's community supervision has had the facility before this I think they have one around district in districts before and I think 2010 it was going to be a where inmates would go to work during the day time and stay during the night so it was kind of that kind of facility and in 2010 I understand the funding got cut for that so if you have those buildings sitting around the state they would make an ideal build a facility just transfer over into receiving centers for each district region around the state but you know they're asking that we we could maybe let them be a pilot program at least in Northwest Georgia's you know as far as being able to receive these kids are in foster care so they're not bouncing from home to home to home to home and that would be for the region one and we would love to have some numbers for you in a year because I think the numbers will be so powerful reduction in the burden across the board for all agencies okay so help me understand how this works is it like a dorm type situation or and you have house parents or I'm I'm trying to visualize it like what it would actually look like the receiving center if they're spending the night they're staying there for two weeks. Visual Roads okay and you know for security purposes and imperial staff and support us. We have the weighted beds would have everything that would constitute safety to where we can monitor we would also have people there with trained trauma informed TBRI folks the kids get up in the middle of the night they can't sleep there would be clinicians on call there would be staff on call 247 so it would they would stay there they would live there they would be there for the time that it takes to either find placement, kinship placement the parents to complete a reunification program up to 12 weeks. We're not we're not looking for this to be a long-term facility we're looking for it to be a stabilization facility which is very different. We're looking to be able to stabilize these children in order so that they have successful placements we're looking to stabilize and to train and to educate the families receiving these children that it's a successful placement and that's what our goal is is to help stop the trauma and build on the foundation that is one that's that they can build on if you think about if you think about how what trauma does to the brain it's like standing over there at that window and dropping a glass onto the pavement and the brain actually fractures it doesn't really fracture like fall apart but what happens is the brain starts storing information in different parts of the brain that these children anybody can't pull together and make sense of so they can't bring in and make sense of what has happened to them and a lot of times what happens when we continue to move them from place to place that fragmentation continues because they're not getting information they're not being said okay you're safe everything's okay you know here's what's happening next here's here's where you are so it's you know there's case management involved in what we're doing is you know like I talked about it's interagency it's everybody working together to provide like a whole picture of what this kid needs we're talking to our local pediatricians to come in we're gonna keep the kids here at the facility and bring the services to them so if you think about that piece that those parts of your brain that you can't even process the information as it's occurring and then we're taking them from this place to this place to this place it's it's overwhelming it's too much for them one of the other one of the other pieces of the school fragment yeah yeah I'm not the schools we've got a school that would George Mountain yeah they already do it they already did it for our seniors for our high school kids so we're talking to them about assessments and we're talking to them about how can we bring that type of an education to our kids there we somebody earlier today talked about you know these kids have been to at several schools in in their stay so all of those parts that are impacting them we're trying to get it all in one place to where we bring an education a trauma informed education to elementary school kids to middle school kids we already have it for you know for the high schoolers so we're just really looking to see what how that we can change what we're doing because what we're doing is not working I think you have the right people here from the department human services that you can work on this with and they work closely with the governor's office so I'm glad that you brought the idea to us and I'm sure there will be further conversations thank you very much thank you for having us now we have Sam Simon and then on deck Jackie Jackson good afternoon Senator Kirk Patrick and members of the Senate study committee on foster care adoption my name is Sam Simon I live in Rome and I'm a former foster parent and an elementary school music teacher I support reforming our foster care system so that the best interests of children are the first priority I don't tell you what I mean by that in February of 2016 my wife and I became foster parents to a two-year-old boy it had been the victim of both abuse and neglect this was a relative's placement but we completed all the required training to become full-fledged foster parents in the summer of 2016 we became aware of plans to grant custody to the child's biological father who was a non custodial parent and we had serious concerns about the safety of this plan and we presented our concerns to defects and juvenile court including evidence that the father was under the influence of illegal drugs during scheduled visitations with the child despite our objections the plan to grant custody to the child's biological father continued to progress and would have come to pass had the father not landed back in jail before the process can be completed in February of 2017 the juvenile court granted custody to the child's biological mother again despite our objections and concerns about the child's safety because the child's mother was unable or unwilling to care for the child he continued to spend most of his time with us we were willing to care for him even though we were no longer receiving any of the support we had received his foster parents we were now paying for child care food and clothing at our own expense and when his mother was no longer able or willing to sell out the paperwork for any of his health insurance we were also paying the entirety of his healthcare costs at our own expense it was in we realized we needed to seek custody of the child ourselves in the summer of 2018 we were awarded temporary custody and superior court and in the summer of 2019 we were awarded permanent custody he's now a straight-eight student and a member of his school's gifted program he's active in the school chorus and accomplished piano student and is receiving regular mental health treatment to address the trauma of his early years but his story could have ended very differently and may I suggest that it would have ended differently if my wife and I had not been advocating for him every step of the way another story in 2018 in room a two-year-old child was beaten to death by his mother's boyfriend six months prior to that the child's leg had been broken and there had been signs of abuse but the child was not removed from the home even though the boyfriend and eventual murderer was already on probation for assault the point I want to make is that while I appreciate the benefits of reunification efforts and I'm fully in favor of reunification when possible or children staying with their biological families they're also risks involved and those are risks that can threaten children's lives I understand that legal precedent states at the fundamental right of familial relations would be violated if a state were to force the breakup of a natural family without showing unfitness and establishing that to do so would be in the children's best interest my question is what is a threshold for unfitness who determines if that threshold has been met I believe that children's best interest encompasses potential child safety concerns and I ask are we taking risks with children's safety one of the PowerPoint presentations from the last meeting of this committee contain information about Texas House bill 567 which raised the threshold for removing a child from home presentation points out that the number of children removed from homes has dropped since the bill passed but are there children who should have been removed and now has not been if the goal to reduce the number of children removed from homes just for the sake of reducing the number or is it protect all children from potential danger and again I have to ask are we are we taking risks with children's safety that same presentation detail supports that are available in some states to boost reunification efforts I'm in favor of support but we also have to understand something that I've observed in my experience as a foster parent and as a teacher at a title one elementary school there's a distinction between parents who won't take care of their children and would benefit from the supports described in this presentation and then there are those parents who show no interest in taking care of their children and allow the safety of their children to be jeopardized not to put too fine a point on it but causing pregnancy or carrying a child for nine months does not make one apparent is what comes after that that earns that distinction I understand that federal law such as the adoption and safe families act and amendments to the child of these prevention and treatment act called for a better balance between protecting children and preserving families in my experience just on my personal observations the imbalances toward preserving families at the expense of protecting children I also fully understand that trauma there's trauma that comes from separating children from families and I agree with everything that's been said here today along those lines but again I've observed an imbalance that is toward recognizing the trauma that comes from separating children from their families and at the expense of addressing children's need for a safe and stable family so I urge you to consider how to address this imbalance to reduce the risk of children's safety as you move forward with this process thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today thank you very much and Jackie Jackson's on her way up and also mentioned that we have written testimony from Leslie race from fostering together at North Point Ministries that's in your folders and that will go up by email to the committee as well go right ahead all right hello thank you so much I'm chairwoman Kirkpatrick in the committee I appreciate being able to be here and speak briefly with you I am a former foster child I'm an adoptive mom and a child welfare advocate because this is my heart space and I so appreciate what you all are here learning about and willing to do for children who are in crisis one of the things that I have been digging into I've recently started my PhD in public policy with a focus on child welfare and I've been looking into what other states are doing because I know that Georgia has a heart for children and just by all of you being here and Candice Broch and her entire team and heading defects I really want Georgia to be on the forefront of protecting these kids and also treating them with dignity my oldest son actually our told us children are adopted my oldest son was adopted out of care and when you are dealing with children who are in care there are a lot of ways we can improve dignity and we can improve the ways that we advocate for them and the ways that we allow them to grow one of the things that I have been working on is a potential foster child's bill of rights and this would be something that other states have already begun to approve and have actually enacted and this is not to put any additional burden on the social workers and on those on the front lines who are already working so hard but just an avenue for us as a state to recognize the necessities those basics that any of your children you would do as a parent because as we've heard so often when you have a child who's been traumatized and a child who has been had multiple placements they don't have that consistency of care so anything that we can do as a community as a state to make sure that these these simple ways to note that they have access to siblings because you know it's very rare for you to have just one child it's often siblings and you might have some with a kinship care placement maybe one who's adopted it will look different for every child and to that end every kid's story is different but every child should have those basic necessities I have written up some ideas and suggestions for a foster youth bill of rights I'd be happy to give this and to forward any information as well and to be a resource because like I said it's it's something I have lived in different ways as a mother just personally and then working with the families that we support with an ignite hope the child welfare ministry that my husband and I founded so thank you so much man this to you yeah that'd be great okay that's everyone we had signed up to speak um I really appreciate all the people that made their way down to the capital to testify it's not all that straightforward unless you come here all the time and y'all have been sitting here a long time so thank you very much for your participation especially appreciate the commissioner and her team being here and sticking with us through the whole committee meeting we have a lot of great information that we considered at the first meeting and now the second meeting we have another meeting on October 26 that one's in Columbus and we'll be focused primarily on adoption issues and then we'll have a final meeting back here that'll be sort of a committee wrap up because we have to finish our work by December 1st and generate a report that will be available to the public and also may lead to legislation or it may lead to some recommendations for our agencies so we can't fix everything in one study committee but I think we've got a good start on gather and the information that we need and really appreciate everybody's attendance and also testimony and with that we're adjourned.",
