  "transcript": "Good morning everybody morning morning everybody thank you for all showing up this morning\ndidn't take long to spend a night. Last night. We're going to open up today our\nmeeting and leader eagerly to open us up with a word of prayer please. Thank you\nMr. Chairman. Let us pray. Oh God our health and ages pass our hope for years to\ncome. We come at this moment thanking you for your many blessings. We thank you\nfor the fresh new mercies that you have given us this morning. We ask now for your wisdom\nand we ask for extra measure of courage as we deliberate the important issues facing\nus today. We also ask you Father to bless the families that we have left behind, protect\nthem and keep them all safe and keep us continually in your care. In the name of Jesus, I pray,\nThank you very much.\nOkay, for folks that are warning to ask for your legislation today, listen up just a minute.\nListen up, listen up.\nIf your bill came out late last evening, it may not be on the blue sheet or the yellow sheet.\nSo if it's not, you need to come back in the morning and ask for it.\nSo anything that you ask for today, it needs to be on either the blue sheet or the yellow sheet or see us in the morning, okay?\nI thought that might cut down the line, so I'm not believe we do.\nOkay.\nOkay, let's go ahead and get started.\nGo ahead, I couldn't see who's over there.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the committee.\nI bring to you for your consideration House Bill 185.\nYou'll find it is the fifth bill down on the second page.\nAnd you will likely recall that I have presented this bill\nbefore this committee about three weeks ago.\nIt was recommitted to regulated industries\nto fix a couple of mistakes to one, a technical error.\nThere was some outdated language as relates to fingerprints.\nThe fingerprint requirement for the licensing.\nThe language used in the bill originally was not current.\nSo that has been corrected on lines 363, the 369.\nAnd then the second change was made,\nthe small change made at the request of the Department\nof Public Health, they asked for a carve out.\nJust to backtrack real quickly, if I may,\njust a reminder, this bill modernizes and streamlines\nthe licensing requirements for dieticians and nutritionists.\nthe language is 30 years old and in dire need of updating.\nSo the Carvout is for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program\nfor Women, Infants, and Children, known as WIC.\nThe Department of Public Health asked for that Carvout\nand we were happy to oblige.\nMr. Speaker, Mr. Chairman, that is the Bill in a nutshell.\nAnd I ask the committee for your favorable consideration.\nI'll yield for any questions.\nThank you, ma'am.\nI don't see any questions.\nThank you Chairman and ladies and gentlemen my bill is 671 that's going to be the first\nbill on page 7 and the LC number on that is 5 0 0 9 8 2 this bill was brought in last\nsession by representative Tim Fleming with floor leader McDonald and presented but it timed out\nwe didn't make it to the floor in time so here I am. So what this bill does is it protects children from\nsexually explicit or lose performances at venues across the state. It does not restrict the\nthe venues from occurring but it provides that to attend these performances you must be of or over\nage 18. Minors cannot be admitted even if accompanied by a parent or guardian. The bill outlines\nfines for venues that violate these requirements in lines 41 to 52. The Department of Health\nmay impose a 50,000 fine for the first time and 100,000 for each subsequent fine. On\nAnd Lon's 53-59 says that the venues are not liable if a minor comes with what is we would\nrefer to as a fake ID that they are not liable under that principle.\nAlso the Department of Revenue may suspend or evoke license if alcohol is sold at these\nvenues with a minor in attendance.\nAgain, this bill is not restrict venue performances, it's intended strictly to protect and restrict\nattendance of minors from events containing sexual\nexplicit performances as outlined in code 1612-100.\nOkay, I got a question for you with partners.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nTo the author of the bill, you know,\nwhile I certainly appreciate the intent\nand I think everyone wants to make sure\nthat children are protected,\nthere has been some concern raised that, you know,\ngiven that OCGA 1612-102 subsection five,\nthe definition of sexual conduct includes homosexuality,\nthat this bill could criminalize a same-sex couple holding hands in a public venue.\nIs that your intent?\nThank you for the question, and now that's not the intent at all.\nIn fact, there's no discrimination in this bill whatsoever.\nThe venues can still take place, but ours outlawed in 16, 12, 100 sexually explicit is specifically\nabout genitalia either being touched or exposed.\nWould the author be open to further amendment to ensure that there is no doubt\ndiscriminatory effects that may result from this legislation.\nWith all due respect, there's no discrimination listed on the bill and this is strictly\nabout protecting the children.\nAgain, as a nurse current state law, the definition of sexual conduct includes homosexuality.\nI think there are some attorneys that are concerned that again, this may lead to discrimination\nagainst one of our vulnerable minority communities here in the state.\nI hope you'll be open to continuing to work\nand perfect this legislation.\nCertainly, I'll be open to doing so with you.\nOkay, thank you for your input.\nI appreciate that.\nThank you.\nOkay, I'm going to suggest y'all have a conversation\nand answer some of those questions offline, if you don't mind.\nOkay, you pass.\nOkay, good.\nThank you, ma'am.\nThank you.\nYes, ma'am.\nmorning Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My bill is on the blue sheet page 5 HB 512 which is\nabout the seventh bill down. HB 512 addresses the challenges that homeowners face when they are\ngoverned by an association. Specifically it caps them out that the association can charge homeowners\nfor a closing letter and second it provides for alternate dispute resolutions before a lien can\nLet me place on the property.\nThat's the bill in a nutshell.\nOkay, you don't see any questions.\nThank you.\nYes, ma'am.\nGood morning, Chair and Committee.\nThank you for hearing my bill this morning.\nI am on page six in the blue sheet halfway down HB626.\nI'm working off a substitute LC570261S.\nThis bill modifies the way we treat, we keep sexual assault kits in the state.\nIt takes out five strikes, five words from the code, no less than 20 years, and\nreplaces it with 30 years.\nThat's it.\nOkay, no saying questions.\nThank you.\nThank you.\nThank you.\nMr. Jones, good to meet you.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.\nI'm working from the Blue Sheep page 7, the 6th bill down,\nHB 718, LC number 590125.\nThis bill is providing that the first week in April\nis dedicated as Women's Golf Week in Georgia,\nthe first week in April.\nThank you for your favorable consideration.\nOkay, thank you, ma'am.\nAll right.\nI'll see you in question.\nHave any votes, please?\nMorning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.\nI am work, my bill is found on page six\nas the last on the bottom.\nIt's House Bill 662, substitute LC46200S.\nWhat this bill does is simply provides\nthat rural hospitals that's been classified\nas a rural emergency hospital can participate\nin the Georgia Heart Program.\nOkay, I don't see any questions.\nThank you.\nYes, ma'am.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nI am on HPE 566, the very last one on the fifth page five.\nThis bill will protect artists from A.I. generated replicas.\nCurrently our copyright law only protects original recordings by artists\nbut not computer generated or AI generated replicas.\nWe are seeing this more and more now\nand so Georgia needs to get ahead\nin order to protect our artists\nand having their voice and visual likeness used\nwithout permission.\nThis is about individual rights.\nThey wanted, they can get permission\nso it's not a complete no right to use.\nHowever, they need to get permission\nin order to do so.\nWe are also having a registry set up\nwith the Secretary of State for those artists who have passed so that they can register\nand make sure that they have those who want permission can go to the Secretary of State\nand find information in order to get permission.\nAnd any violators will be subject to civil penalties and it will just follow our current\ncivil statute.\nOkay.\nI don't see any questions.\nThank you.\nExcuse me.\nThank you.\nI have a question.\nI'm sorry.\nGovernor Spell. Thank you. Okay. No other questions. Thank you.\nThere's a silcon. Jim Silcon. Mr. Chairman, my bill is not on the sheet, but I'm\nhappy to come back tomorrow if you'd rather me just come in. It's not on the yellow or the blue sheet.\nOkay. We'll see you in the morning. Okay. Great. Thank you.\nGood morning. On page six, halfway down under modified rule, you will see HB 620 LC 570244.\nIt is blood plasma donation awareness day on February 17th. It comes out of the special\nrules committee. Blood plasma is critical treatment for immunodeficiency conditions.\nfemale liver conditions like sickle cell, pregnant women and babies in utero, which\ngenetic conditions shock trauma emergencies and burns just a few. If you go to the American\nRed Cross homepage, you'll see their call for donations today due to an emergency shortage.\nOf course, the whereas clauses won't be in the code, but it gives important facts in\nhistory on the importance of blood plasma donations. If there are any questions, Mr. Chair,\nI ask for the committee's favor of consideration.\nI don't see any questions.\nThank you.\nYes, ma'am.\nThank you to the chair.\nThank you to the committee.\nI present to you House Bill 138.\nLittle explanation.\nLast summer myself and members of this body\nis actually going to be on the first page.\nLast summer, myself, members of this body\nto include chairman Hitchens, chairman Crow,\nrepcomings and a few others went to law enforcement\ntraining together and experience\nwhere we call scenario-based training with law enforcement.\nWe were able to see the training at work\nand how it makes officers more proficient\nand reduces the liability for agencies\nacross the state by constantly training with hands-on training.\nThe benefits.\nThis reduces workmen's comp, reduces claims in general,\nreduces the litigation, and it's less light\nand it ensures that officers are less likely\nto use excessive force and be more confident\nwhen in the field by putting them in real life environments\nin their yearly training.\nThis is funded through the State Training Center.\nCodifying this ad will save local law entities money\nbecause they can get this training\nwith the State Mobile Unit that goes out and teaches us\nwith the mobile team and it doesn't cost\ntheir local government one additional penny.\nAll this bill does is ask a single line\nde-escalation techniques and methods\nto include scenario-based training.\nThis bill is supported by the Executive Director of Post and Executive Director of the Training Center as well and with that I stand for any questions.\nI don't see any questions. Thank you.\nI'm so glad I owe you an apology. I think you billed is on the list. Would you please present that to us at this time?\nCertainly. That's why I'm a stake. I didn't see it.\nWe're looking at bill House Bill 664 and it is all the way.\nThis bill was brought to me by the Hancliffe Humber's Association in St.\nEast Brings.\nThey are a really old subdivision.\nThey were created in 1966 by Tom Cousins and they do not have a provision in their\ncovenants and restrictions to amend their covenants so they would like to bring this\nbill to allow them to, with 80% of their landowners in that subdivision, with their vote\na super majority to be able to amend their covenants, and that is the bill.\nOkay, thank you, ma'am.\nDon't see any questions.\nThank you.\nThank you.\nMr. Chairman.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman, members committee, House Resolution 392, Yellowsheet, 7th page\n4th from the top, yellow sheet, 7th page, 4th from the top, house resolution 392.\nWhat we're doing with the house resolution 392, we're creating a joint study committee\non the state board of registration of used motor vehicle dealers and used motor vehicle\nparts dealers, right, currently they reside in the Secretary of State's office.\nWhat this study committee is needed is to determine whether the regulation of the use motor vehicle industry would be best suited within the same agency that is responsible for issuing license plates that are essential for the operation of such businesses, which would be the Department of Revenue.\nOkay. Thanks, sir. I'll see you.\nThank you. Appreciate it.\nYes, sir.\nThank you, Chairman.\nTwo bills the first bill is House bill 168 on page eight number three\nHouse bill 168 LC number fifty zero nine seven eight is a bill to add an over-step\nOversight step for the local delegation to re-approved the special purpose local auction sales tax and that's the bill in summation\nOkay, don't see any questions second bill is house bill\nOn page number three, House Bill 342, LC number 550582S.\nIt is a substitute.\nIt repeals advertising restrictions on low THC oil licensing.\nRight now they have a full restriction of the not being able to advertise.\nThis allows the commission to set guidelines to allow the six companies that have heavy regulations\nto be able to advertise to their constituents.\nOkay, you have a question that will park that you yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Sherman. Going back to House Bill 168\nIsn't it true that counties already have an extensive process for living at S-plus tax?\nCould you help me explain why it's necessary for the state to now get in between the county and voters?\nAbsolutely. It allows an additional step for the local delegation to have communication with the county and with your\nwith the local delegation to make sure that that additional penny that is being added onto the tax code is in line with where the counting wants to go.\nIs that an additional layer of government bureaucracy?\nNo sir, it's just an additional oversized step.\nThank you.\nOkay, no other questions. Thank you.\nThank you.\nChair and Board.\nA good morning, Chairman and members of the committee bringing you House Bill 632.\nThis is on page 6, a little past the midpoint down, page 6, House Bill 632.\nThis bill comes at the request of our Department of Veteran Services.\nIt clarifies the language regarding the exemption of occupational taxes and business license\nfees for our disabled veterans.\nIt also updates the periods of war and armed conflict.\nThe end result of this legislation is that more of our disabled veterans that qualify\nthis benefit will be receiving it.\nOkay.\nNo questions.\nThank you, sir.\nChairman?\nWe dour.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nBringing two bills to you today, both on page six.\nThese are two additional bills that have come out of the Blue Ribbon Committee looking\nat licensure over the summer.\nThe first one, HB630, deals with the used cars, state board registration, and\nHouse Bill 635, state licensing board, the residential, commercial, general\ncontractors, both the streamline, and let's cover some licensure process.\nOkay, no questions, thanks sir.\nI'm off to hearing this.\nAll right, thank you, Mr. Chairman, members on page 5, obviously we're about 5 down here.\nhave House Bill 504, House Bill 504 is allows Georgia residents to purchase a vehicle\nvalue protection plan, works much like gap insurance and set forward coverage of value\nof the vehicle and not the loan balance. Will that Mr. Chairman stand for question?\nYou got a question, Cory. Chairman Martin has a question.\nRepresentative, we talked about this in subcommittee and my question is I was not\nI have multiple meetings to get back to the committee.\nIt was mentioned, do we ever see a contract,\nwhat this looks like?\nBecause as I understand in some community,\nthis money could never be paid to the individual\nbut paid for the policy.\nIt had to go to a dealer and they bought another car.\nI'm just curious, do we ever see what a sample contract\nlook like to make sure we weren't setting Georgia's up\nfor a bad deal that was sold to them at a car dealer\nthat would benefit the car dealer and the dealer\nor get paid for selling it?\nYeah, and thank you for your question, Mr. Chairman.\nI know you missed full committee,\nand I'll say this, in this bill 504,\nit outlines what I can and cannot do.\nThis is another option for folks that they want to buy.\nIt cannot be part of the sale,\nand I can't require them to purchase it\nas a uncompensuous sale, anything like that.\nSo I do understand your issue and you raise those\nand so committee.\nSo the question was, did we ever see what an agreement looked like?\nDid we ever see a sample agreement?\nWhat happened to bring you to the Amazon sample contract?\nRight, that's like you actually.\nOK, thank you.\nI'll see you in the other question.\nThanks, sir.\nThanks, sir.\nYes, sir.\nUh-huh.\nThanks, sir.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nI'm bringing to you House Bill 676.\nIt's a second down on page 7.\nHouse Bill 676 is a frivolous mechanics lean bill. Currently the code is very\nspecific on what is required in order for an entity to file a mechanical\nlean on a project. We are running into instances now where individuals are\nfiling frivolous leans and there's no penalty. I've heard stories now where they're\ncommunicating with lawyers explaining to them that there's no right to have no\nrights to do this at which point they've said that's true but we'll make your\nlife miserable and you'll be surprised how many people will give them. This will help\nsmall businesses and owners and I believe a small piece to adding towards\nshorter form but that I will stand for questions. You don't see any questions?\nThank you very much. You're clear. Thanks, sir. Yes, sir. Yeah, come on up.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman. I've got House Bill 493. It's going to be on the yellow\nsheet fourth page about fifth from the bottom. House Bill 493 will\ndesignate the Piney Woods cattle as the Georgia heritage cattle breed. This\ncattle breed has history dating back to the state. Since the 1500s used by\nmany Native American tribes, a key part of the American Revolution and the\nCivil War. Not aware of any other cattle breed that would like to get this\nheritage designation and it's got the full support of the cattle with\nassociation, so ask for your favor.\nOK, we've got a question with the Williams at you.\nThanks, Chairman, to the author of the bill.\nThank you for the bill.\nA friend of mine owned several of them.\nThey can absolutely live off of anything.\nYou had gotten even dropped here in front of them.\nThey'll eat in 1959, Cadillac.\nYeah, sir, you were great.\nThey're very native to the southeast.\nThank you.\nI've seen the other questions.\nChairman DeLokes.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nMembers of the committee, House Bill 532\nis the next to last bill on the very last page.\nThat would be page eight.\nWhat this bill does is allow DNR to use grant money\nto pay counties for work searches, road maintenance\nthat they do on state property.\nOkay, I don't see any questions, thank you sir.\nThank you.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nThank you, committee.\nI bring a bottom of page seven.\nI'm page five, excuse me, page five.\nI have HB555.\nThis bill passed out due to judiciary in 15-1.\nThis bill is given George's chance again to the American dream of owning a house.\nIt limits someone from owning more than 2,000 houses and gives the Wall Street owners four\nyears to sell down to that point.\nThis will address the supply of the housing crisis in Georgia.\nI'll stand for any questions.\nDo you have a question for you, Richard?\nDo you hear me?\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nHow did you arrive at the 2,000 number?\nI just, no really scientific method, I just thought 2000 would be a number that wouldn't\nhurt Georgians.\nI don't want to hurt private, you know, private Georgians.\nIt's just really going after the outside Wall Street investors.\nThank you.\nThank you.\nOkay.\nDon't see any other questions.\nThanks, sir.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nThere's two camera.\nMore Mr. Chairman, I have HP 466, LC 620080, middle of the fourth page.\nThis bill would name the Marsh Tacky Horse, the heritage horse of Georgia.\nThey were once plentiful, used in Civil War, Revolutionary War by Native Americans, but\ntheir numbers because of disease is dwindled and the recognition by the livestock\nconcerns in other groups that we need to start taking action now.\nis the first step in recognizing that we need to preserve this animal.\nThere are smaller horses.\nI can get one one without a staff platter, but they're good horses and we need to preserve\nthis braid.\nSo that's the bill.\nOkay.\nThanks, sir.\nI don't see any questions.\nAll right.\nOkay.\nJim Gellie.\nThank you, Chairman and members of the committee.\nI bring to you House Bill 447.\nIt's a page four just above the halfway mark.\nAnd what this bill does, it gives prosecutors a tool to crack down on gift card theft by these international\nInternationally sophisticated criminal enterprises, and I'm happy to answer any questions\nNo questions. Thank you. Thank you\nThank you, Mr. Chairman members of the committee\nJust I just want to give\nspeak right into that mind. Okay, there we go. Y'all can't hear me. Yeah, good morning. All right,\nthis is better. My mic is low. Well, I just want to say some brief words before I get into\nthis house. Oh, house resolution 40, which is number two on the list. It's a study committee.\nAnd I want you guys to understand how I came up with this resolution resolution for a study\ncommittee. The storm that we had in our state, Helene, was very tragic and I\ntold my team it didn't affect my constituents but it affected Georgia's. And so\nif you affect Georgia and you affect me and so I wanted something to be meaningful\nand plenty for the state of Georgia so they came up with this study\ncommittee for reinsurance and basically reinsurance is when the insurance\ncompany transfers risk to another company and call it reassurance so most of\nour insurance providers in here know what but know about reinsurance and that's\nto bring the big big guys in to subsidize the insurance when you can't pay\nthat's the gist of the bill just study committee just try to bring all the big\nguys here studying the gentleman from the 112 passed the bill on the floor on\nyesterday and I think this study committee will really help his bill to\nstudy what we need in our state. Okay, have a question, Chairman Smith. I just want\nto thank you for looking into the needs of what I call ordinary citizens and\nrough times. Thanks for your idea. Thank you, Madam Chair. Okay, no other questions.\nThank you.\nThank you.\nThank you.\nMr. Chairman, House Bill 645 is on the bottom third of page 6, and this is a very simple\none-page bill.\nSection 1 is the meat of it, and it's literally one sentence, and I promised Chairman Cooper\nthat I would keep this simple, and that's what I've done.\nwhat this does is repeal the requirement for long-term care facilities to test new residents for\nCOVID and new hires for COVID when they're coming in. This is put into place in the height of\nthe pandemic when a lot much broad scale transformation was going on in that industry and this is just\na return to normalcy and the department's good with it and it's something they're not enforcing\nand now anyway, and most providers are not doing.\nAnd so it's just, like I said, a simple return to normalcy.\nOK, you got a couple of questions for you.\nMr. Miller, is it you?\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nTo the author over here, hi, to the author.\nSo you would agree that the elderly\nare some of the most susceptible of our constituents\nto COVID and other viruses.\nAbsolutely, Am.\nAnd just to put this in contact,\nwhen this was put into place,\nthe requirement to test all new move-ins for COVID\nand new hires, they were visitor restrictions at that time too.\nNow the visitors traffic has returned to normal.\nThese are residences of these people living\nin these settings.\nThey're coming and going.\nThere's three shifts a day of caregivers\nthat are going back home.\nSo a test is just a point in time\nthat gives you some data at that point in time.\nIt does nothing to quantify the ongoing risk of this virus.\nAnd so there's still safeguards in place.\nPhysician Sano, an exam before anyone moves in,\nor anyone begins work.\nThere's infection control policies.\nAll of the right safeguards are in place.\nThis is just a simple return to normalcy.\nWe're part. Are there do staff or incoming residents are they tested for anything else they are. There's a there's a physician's evaluation report that's done and part of that is a tuberculosis test that's been in place for decades.\nAnd then you know the position signs off one of the things that physician signs off on is that the person is free of communicable diseases.\nIs it not true that COVID is essentially endemic now in which, you know, Americans today\nare still dying from this in which I don't understand why we're selecting one, especially\nwhen there is an ongoing process in which other diseases are being tested for.\nAgain, I think to protect our seniors, I don't know why we're having this sort of selective\npolitically-driven motivation of removing this requirement.\nCould you better help me explain?\nWell, understand, if you're making a political driven,\nthat's your choice.\nIt's not mine.\nThis is not a political issue.\nIt's just a simple return to normalcy.\nAnd to sow that, the staff and managers of these settings\ncan focus on what's important.\nA lot of times when people are moving in,\nthey're in a crisis situation.\nAnd so just even a simple 15, 20, 30 minute test\nis a distraction from other things that are more important.\nand if they're symptomatic, of course,\nthe physician will catch that\non the physician's evaluation report,\nand that'll be handled that way.\nOkay, Karen Martin, just real briefly,\nthis doesn't prevent them from doing the test,\nthis just, they're running the business.\nThey just, they're set forth, isn't it true,\nto care for the people in their facility,\nand they're gonna do, they've done that for years,\nprior to 2020, through the best of their ability,\nthis allows them that purview, does it not?\nExactly right, thank you for that.\nAnd yeah, this is just a matter of,\nyou know, the legislature is not in the business\nof running daily operations of these settings.\nThe department has a good handle on it\nand they're neutral on this because they,\nthere's the overline qualifier of the quality\nand infection control and position evaluation\nand all the other safeguards in place.\nThis was just something that was done.\nIt was a late ad to Chairman Cooper's\nHouse bill 987 in 2020, when the pandemic was raging,\nif his illustrations were in place.\nOkay, Pro Tem has a question.\nThis was put in place also before we had a vaccine.\nYeah, well, it's all right.\nYes, man.\nTo be honest, I didn't recall that we actually put it in law.\nI thought it was as a result of emergency powers,\nbut we put it in law.\nBut we don't have it in law that one, for example,\nmust be screened for a flip.\nFor flip, is that right?\nAbsolutely.\nAnd is it not also true that many more people in 20, 24, and 25 are dying from flu than\nthey are from COVID, so I mean, it would be consistent with other communicable diseases\nthat we don't put it in law, we lead that up to best practices.\nUp to best practices, absolutely, and yeah, it's very simple, I know it gets complicated\nin these settings because of just when you say COVID it just brings out all kind of other\nthoughts and ideas but it's very simple and it's really a non-issue because the department\nis not even enforcing it and provider aren't doing it.\nThis is just a cleanup so that we're allowing providers and the department to focus on\nthe priorities that matter most.\nOkay, we've got a couple more questions if you will, let's be brief, share that a couple.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman, one of the factors is that the nursing homes across our state\nand across our country are extremely limited on the number of people applying for jobs\nand their short staffed, and a lot of people that are applying for jobs to take care of\nthe patients don't want to be forced to take the COVID tests and want to have the choice\nthat we all have now.\nSo this should help them with getting people to work in the centers.\nGood discussion.\nThank you, Chairman Cooper.\nThank you.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm going to have three real quick. Top of page two. House Bill 159.\nThis would increase the outstanding bond limit of mortgage revenue bonds that the Georgia Housing and Finance Authority can issue from $3 billion to $6 billion to fund their mortgage origination programs and Georgia Dream Program that they run through DCA.\nD.C.A.\nNo seeing question, what's your next one?\n161 right below that one.\nGeorge Bureau of Investigation concurrently, the Director concurrently issue administrative\nsubpoenas for very limited production of communication and subscriber information.\nThis would add a couple of other crimes to that to include swatting and domestic terrorism.\nOkay.\nNo questions on that.\nAll right, and then lastly, on page seven, about the third of the way down House Bill 691,\nit would create the Georgia Resilience Office and the Georgia Resilience Officer position\nwithin the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency.\nIt would be administratively attached to them.\nThis was a result of the study committee we did over the offseason on disaster mitigation\nand resilience.\nDo you have a question, Kim Smith?\nThank you.\nI just want to commend you for this bill and also, we learned so much.\non the study committee and I want to thank you for bringing this to our attention.\nGeorge and Noah always needs to be a one act react we need to be prepared much better\nthan we are now.\nYou do a good job of cleaning up the mess, you don't do a good job of preventing it the\nnext time.\nSo thank you for that.\nYeah, thank you.\nThank you.\nNo more questions.\nThank you very much.\nJeremy Smith.\nThank you, chairman Paris.\nMembers of the committee.\nThis morning I bring to you House Bill 535, that should be the sixth from the bottom\nof page five. This bill is in response to the Calum case decision that came out\nof court of bills. It's caused a little bit of a confusion and inconsistency and\nhow we calculate time served in almost all contexts. If a person is sitting in\njail waiting a judication of a case in Georgia, the law dictates their time\nsitting in jail counts as time served if their sentence to more jail or present\ntime. This bill provides a very simple fix to the Calum case and counts time served\nfor probation or medication cases in the same way as any other case.\nOkay, don't see any questions.\nThank you, Senator.\nTim Syms.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman, members of committee, House Bill 430, which is third from the top\non page four, does two things, section one, makes clear that if you are put on the sex\noffense registry in another state by moving to Georgia, that other state's decision automatically\ncarries over. And then section two clarifies that a sheriff of a given county if a judge\nwaves the a restricted address that sheriff has to be notified and has the ability to take\nthat issue to spear record if they find fit has to bill. Okay, no questions. Thanks, sir.\nThank you Chairman House Bill 237 page 2 halfway down it's a bill that would\nit protect creatives in our state that through music film or dance that\nthere were not be used against them in court unless in a pre-trial they can\nshow that it meets certain qualifications. The second bill is on page. Oh, sorry. Page\n7 House Bill 689. It establishes the Homelessness Prevention Program under DCA. Obviously,\nit wouldn't be until appropriated, but it creates a line item opportunity for our state\nto invest in Homelessness Prevention. We saw a lot of this during with ARPA money and\nI think the ARPA money is about to run out, so there's a conversation to be had if it's\ngood for the state to keep people in their homes.\nAnd then finally page 8, 328 is the SSOQEE Scholarship Program for the State of Georgia.\nIt increases the cap from $1,240 million, and it changes some other things in there as\nwell.\nOkay, no questions.\nThank you, Sarah.\nThank you.\nThank you, Chair and members of the committee. House Bill 627 halfway down on page 6. So straight forward, clean up the juvenile justice code, providing consistency between class A and class B designated felony definitions.\nPast unanimous the other house last year couldn't get to the Senate you got a question for you\nYes, I heard some concerns regarding this bill\nYou know it isn't this true that this bill add to the sacraments where a child can be prosecuted as an as an adult and that child will then be a\nFellin for the rest of their life\nThere's this is substitute\nYeah, that that whole section got stricken out. This is just the original bill from last year the passing and it's the other house\nAll we're doing is striking if you look online 12 and 13 striking provided that such daily weapon is not a firearm\nIt's all all this bill does\nOkay, no more questions. Thank you. Thank you\nThank mr. Chairman members of the committee. I'm here to present to you house bill 376 which is on the last page of the blue sheet\nThis increases the cap on Georgia's historic rehabilitation tax credit from 30 to 50 million.\nThis bill passed the house last year 162 to 5 and got held up on the Senate.\nAnd I just want to thank Chairman Blackman and Chair Williamson on their help on this bill.\nOkay, no questions.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nAnd I believe I've already presented 370, 295, and 246, but on page 2, House Bill 288.\nThis is a bill that will provide some new process for law enforcement if they're put on\nwhat's called a Brady or Giglio list for a prosecutor can basically single-handedly\nput a law enforcement officer on one of these lists that could single-handedly ruin\na law enforcement officer's career and so we've worked with PAC and about every group\ninterested in this issue. I think we've got a good bill that provides due process for\nlaw enforcement that would go through the post and provide a much needed due process\nfor our officers. Okay, have a question for you.\nMr. Evans, that year. Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. To the author, two questions. One was\nwondering what what brought this about what situation who was harmed why we're\nhere and then secondly does any other state provide this extra level of\nprotection for law enforcement? Sure so there have been multiple examples across\nthe state of officers being put on these lists in fact that since I've\nintroduced this bill I've actually gotten calls from spouses and officers saying\nhow this is similarly when their career they haven't been able to get another\njob because they've been put on these lists and again there's no way to get\nthere's no way to prove that they were didn't do something wrong and so there\nare multiple examples here in Georgia there have been a handful of states that\npassed similar legislation which states just off top my head I know Iowa and\nNorth Carolina just in recent years there's several others though you could\nlet us know about that I appreciate it and then why no concerns for any other\npeople that might be put on this list whose reputation could be hung or why are\nwe stingling out say that again sorry why the list is I understand I don't\nin the process criminal law, but the list says that there's some reason to doubt the credibility\nof the witnesses. Am I understanding that right?\nThat's right.\nAnybody who gets on this list, I would imagine, is not happy about it.\nOnly law enforcement can be put on the list.\nOnly law enforcement.\nThat's right.\nOkay.\nThank you.\nOkay.\nMr. Miller, you have a question.\nDo.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nthe author, the federal system has a list of officers or maintains a list of officers whose\ncredibility has been questioned and they have a policy of not using those officers under\ncertain circumstances. Is that correct? I believe that is correct, yes.\nAnd is the motivation for that? To your understanding that prosecutors want to encourage law enforcement\nofficers who are special class of witnesses in criminal cases to be honest to\nnot lie under oath to not withhold exculpatory evidence and to not do things\nthat would otherwise jeopardize a valid prosecution.\nAbsolutely that's the point of these lists. I think it's important that you have\nthis that the prosecutor maintains the ability to use this and it's actually a\nSupreme Court ruling that ensures it, but I do think it's important, you know, as you\nknow, if an law enforcement officer is never using a criminal case and their work is going\nto become irrelevant pretty quick and some officers at any arrest they make now are just\nbeing thrown out because prosecutors can't call them to the witness stand.\nSo what's important here, this again takes it out of the court system, it moves it all\nto post.\nI think it's also important to note that this is an opportunity, whereas right now, if\nofficers put on a such a list. It's not reported to post. It's not review. This\none, sure, if an officer actually did do something wrong or if they've said\nsomething that's untrue, it'll be investigated and it will stay in their\nfiles. This will also help us ensure that if there's an officer's done\nsomething wrong, that it will be taken off the streets. One more question, Mr.\nTriman. Who will be doing the investigating other officers or officers of\nthe court post. Thank you. Okay, I have another question. Jim Hitchens. Isn't it true that\nthey're denied due process and arrangement is in place now and what you're doing would give them\ndue process to have an investigation and bring out the facts. Now they just go on the list and\nthat's the end of it. That's right. I mean right now a prosecutor can single-handedly put someone\non a list and there's no way to get off. All this does is give an opportunity for an officer to\nto prove their case and again it will ensure investigation if they did something wrong and get them off the streets.\nWe appreciate it.\nThank you, Chairman.\nThank you for the bill. Isn't it true that North Carolina, Iowa and Minnesota have taken up similar due process bills for this exact issue?\nAnd I think there may even be others, but certainly I know at least the first two and I'm sure Minnesota as well.\nThank you.\nYou you had mentioned you you've already discussed house bill 370 have you know I have yes, okay?\nNo, no other questions. Thank you. Thank you, mr\nOkay, Prince\nWell, I miss chairman members of the committee pays four of your blue sheet house bill 483\nprovides protection for\nCode enforcement officers in the what they perform in their duty\nOkay, we don't see any questions, thank you sir.\nThank you.\nBig simply a shocker.\nThank you chairman and members of the committee.\nBlue sheet, page two, house bill 259.\nIt's a bipartisan effort here to desidate and recognize on the second\neach August as local elected officials day here in Georgia.\nBecause I know we have a lot of local elected officials,\nformer local elected officials here.\nAnd you know how it is to serve.\nAnd sometimes it's almost like a thankless job,\nbut we want to show our appreciation for them.\nOK.\nWhat do you have a question, I'm sure?\nJames Smith.\nI do have one question, would you consider adding site\nelected local officials today?\nWhat do you consider adding state elected officials to that?\nWell, you know how it is when we're doing things for ourselves.\nThey don't really like that.\nSo we were able to just do the local and for the record,\nI do have my town, just for the record, my ties on, okay.\nOkay, don't see any other questions.\nThank you.\nOkay, thank you.\nThat's you, Campbell.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman. I do have a COVID-19 Department. I didn't know I was going to be doing this right now, so I'm borrowing a coat, so thank you.\nI'm presenting HB618 and LC number 520793.\nThis bill is about requiring any seller of real property to make certain disclosures\nregarding flood damage to buyers.\nThe way it is now, a renter,\nif you own a home and you're renting it,\nyou have to disclose flood damage to a renter.\nBut you don't have to disclose it to a buyer.\nThis bill, this is the whole bill,\nit's one thing that it puts a buyer\non the same level as a renter.\nSo that's what it is, and I appreciate any consideration.\nThank you.\nOkay, don't see any questions.\nThank you, sir.\nOkay, members of the committee have a request.\nRepresentative Evans.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nOn the yellow sheet, two compensation resolutions,\nHR 118 and 119, these are resolutions\nthat passed out last year and got sold over in the Senate\nand hoping we can get them across the finish line this year.\nOkay, thank you.\nThank you, Mr. Chair, but I'd like to ask for a House Bill 490 on behalf of Representative\nBayes Moore.\nAnd this bill deals with crimes and efficiencies as it relates to training programs relative\nto human trafficking for hotels, and we know that human trafficking has been a big focus\nhere in Georgia, and we'd like to ask for that on her behalf.\nOkay.\ndon't see any questions. Thank you. Chairman Hawkins, is that you?\nThank you, Mr. Chairman. On the type of page six, HB571 licensing of radiologist assistance\nto increase access and then lower down on their page HB629 remove requirements for\nlicense positions with the AED.\nOkay.\nNo, do we have a question?\nChairman Blackman has a question for you.\nYeah.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nI appreciate the conversation with Chairman Hawkins this far.\nBut on 5.71, are we talking about the establishment of a new license here?\nI'd just direct your attention to sections 3.34, 3.35 and 3.36.\nIt is, it's an upper level of radiology assistance.\nI just, I'm not a change to what we have now.\nI noticed that it mentions established adopt exam\nand a new advisory board.\nSo, under the purview of the board.\nSo, thank you for the answers.\nThank you.\nOkay, any other questions there?\nNo, say more questions.\nThank you.\nJim Jasper's.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman, Committee.\nLike on page eight, House Bill 248,\nthe DO Thermal Tax Credit.\nIt has a cap and a sunset.\nIt'd be very helpful.\nThank you.\nOkay, you don't see any questions on that.\nCould I dim see, is that you?\nYes.\nMy apologies, I have a few measures\nthat have just gotten ripe and ready for the asking.\nOkay.\nThe first is HB533, the wrongful Conviction Compensation Act that we've worked on for years.\nWhereas the Hocom has worked on this and it's been a joy and an honor to work to try to\ntake this out of our legislative hands.\nAlong with that, that is on the blue sheet, I'm sorry, page 5, 7 from the bottom, 533.\nOn the yellow sheet, going along with this, would be page 6 at the bottom, two resolutions,\nare 128 and 129 which are compensation resolutions. The house passed them out last year and they did not get\nheard in the Senate. The next is on page 7 on the blue sheet, third from the top HB677, to help with\nthe placement upon discharge of children from our hospitals and psychiatric residential treatment centers.\nThen also on the yellow I believe I asked yesterday, but just to make sure on page 5, 10th from the top\nHB 567\nTeledenistry to allow Georgia Dennis to and hygienist to practice outside of the office\nOkay, I've seen questions\nHere we go. Here's a give you a quiz\nYes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman\nOn page five of the yellow sheet near the bottom house bill 582\nthis is a Georgia Survivor Justice Act. What this deals with is individuals that\nhave been coerced or forced into committing crimes. This includes not\nmalice murder but the various types of murders all the way down to minor crimes.\nIf they're doing time on it that sets out the criteria on how long they will\nserve if it's a life sentence it will reduce it to 10 to 30. As I told the\ncommittee this is not a get out of free jail bill but this is to try and help\nthese people get their life started up again. Okay, don't see any questions on\nthere. New registration. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Being distributed right now is\na substitute to House Bill 579. While that's going out I will tell you all about\nabout it, the, there was a study committee chair about,\ncould chair about Chairman Hatchett,\nlooking into licensing reform,\nRepresentative Matt Reeves has done an outstanding job\nworking on that.\nHe previously presented the preparations committee\nsubstitute to that bill.\nWhat we've done is in the interim taken input\nfrom folks who are concerned about how interstate\ncompacts insurance coverage and others may be impacted,\nor Georgia professionals may be impacted\nby this legislation.\nSo the substitute that's coming out to you now\nsimply removes what was part two,\nwhich dealt with registration of auctioneers,\ngeologists, and hearing aid dispensers.\nThat's no longer in the bill.\nWhat's remained is section one,\ndealing with what I consider expediting\nand improving the process for applications for licensure\nand renewals of licensure is really getting\nat the heart of the issue.\nI think there's going to be continued effort to work on this in the future and I'd ask for the committee's favorable consideration of the rules committee substitute.\nOkay.\nI have a question for you.\nYes sir.\nRepresentative Avige.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nTo the leader of the station.\nI think I heard you right.\nI've gotten calls from auctioneers.\nThey're completely out of this.\nThat's correct.\nThank you.\nOkay. Any other questions? Okay. We're going to entertain a motion to do pass on rule\nsubstitute LC550580S. Have a motion in a second. Is there any opposition? No, see any\nin the observation that the S was okay.\nWho else, you have them?\nYes, this is House Bill 433, it's on your blue sheet, four down, on your blue sheet,\non page 4. This just allows, right now there's a gap in the GCIC information that the Department\nof Human Services and therefore the Division of Family and Children Services is authorized\nto access per Georgia code. This would just allow them the breadth of the information that's\navailable on the Georgia Crime Information Center. I'll be happy to stand for any questions.\nOkay, you don't see any questions.\nOkay, here we are.\nNo, no.\nChairman Powell, do you want to present 467?\nmuch surprise surprise. This is a Monument Protection Act. This clarifies some language\nthat has never been clarified about who has standing on this Monument movement when\nthere's petitions to move. The most important part of this is that it gives the local governments\nan option, a 90-day option, and that option would be if they wish to move a\nmonument. They can run it, they're legal, the legal organ of that city are\naccounting, and they can advertise that they want that this monument is to be\nmoved and they're offering it up to interested parties. This gives them an option\nif there's lawsuits that are filed in that after the court, after the court is\ndeal with the matter then they can still come back and offer it up again. The decision\nwould be up to the local governments to do this. They could pick whoever they think would\nbe the appropriate, the appropriate group to move this monument. It tries to get some\nof this out of litigation and some of the bitterness that surround some of these issues\nin this day and time.\nOkay. I don't see any questions. Thanks, sir. Okay. We've got approximately 150\nbills on our blue sheet, so forth. Obviously we're not going to get to all of those, but what we'll do now is\nset a rules calendar for March the 6th, cross-over day. So we'll do that now.
