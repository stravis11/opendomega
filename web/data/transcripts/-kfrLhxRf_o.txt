Well, good morning. I hope all of you had a great weekend, a beautiful weather weekend.
Ready to go to work this week. We will begin our day today with scripture reading and prayer by
the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning
will be introduced by the gentleman from the fourth house district, Representative Casey Carpenter,
Representative Carpenter. Brothers and sisters of the house it's always a pleasure to come up here
and stand in the great pulpit of the great David Ralston. I know it's very hard of you, I know it's
was very hard for you to believe that in fact I even know a pastor.
Pastor Stan Leicester is not even my pastor.
He is simply a friend.
Someone that shares the love of high school sports,
shares the love of cheering for the University of Georgia,
and watching our kids grow up.
I will say next year, however, leader Burns,
he will be cheering for the Georgia Southern Eagles
because his son Evan signed a scholarship to play football there.
Pastor Leicester has a knack for bringing God's Word
to the Revolence in the 21st century.
I will stand in advance.
Today we might be voting for sports camings
of please pray for me in advance.
After the pledge, we will be laying hands
on people in the corner.
Ladies and gentlemen, my friend, Pastor Stan Leicester.
As I left my house this morning, my wife asked me,
how do you feel about today?
I said I'm not that concerned about the devotion,
but I'm terribly concerned about the introduction.
Thank you, Speaker Austin and Representative Carpenter,
for this invitation to address the house today.
I want to thank each of you for your leadership,
for your willingness to serve and for your effort
to make Georgia a better place for all of us.
In the 2004 Olympics held in Athens, Greece,
Matthew Emmons was the best in the world at the three position 50 meter rifle competition.
As they competed, Emmons built such a lead that when he got to the last shot, he had a
lead that was almost insurmountable.
When he got to his last shot, all that Emmons had to do was hit the target.
He was the best in the world.
He didn't have to have a bullseye.
He just had to hit the target anywhere on the target.
He got to his last shot and Iman's took aim.
He shot a shot in Bullseye.
When Iman's looked up at the scoreboard, the scoreboard read zero.
To his dismay, Matthew Iman's had shot the target to the left of the target intended.
He'd hit the right target.
hit a bull's eye, but at the wrong target.
It was a defining moment for Matthew Emmons.
That day, instead of finishing first and winning the gold medal,
Matthew Emmons finished in eighth place.
Every life has a few defining moments.
All of our lives have moments that define us.
Maybe this is a defining moment for us.
The season we're in, what we're dealing with.
Great leaders leverage those defining moments
to see great things happen and to shift culture.
There's a moment in Israel's history
that's recorded in Jeremiah 29.
It's a moment that speaks of the potential present
when we get involved and we participate.
Israel's being held captive in Babylon
and the word comes through Jeremiah
and it says this in verse number four.
Thus says the Lord to all who are carried away
captive from Jerusalem to Babylon.
build houses, dwell in them, plant gardens, eat their fruit, take wives, have children,
let your sons and your daughters take wives and husbands and have children,
that they may increase and not be diminished, and seek the peace of the city where you live
because as it prospers, you'll prosper. I think that one of the things that we take away is this
that great leadership shifts culture through involvement. For each of us, build houses, prosper,
keep growing. Jeremiah is saying shift culture by engaging in the world that you're placed in.
Vision's about one day. Cultures about every day. As leaders, we have the unique opportunity to
look forward and to look at the present at the same time. We have a vision where we eventually
want to be, and we establish culture where we are. Great leadership understands that vision
is described, but culture is modeled. Jeremiah says, stay engaged, that you'll increase
and not diminish. Vision can't be demonstrated, but eventually it becomes a reality because
culture models it every day. Recently I had somebody speak to me and while they were sharing
with me, I had recently met them and in our second conversation, this gentleman looks at
me and he says to me, you look like somebody that used to work out.
I don't even know what that means.
The problem was that I had a great vision but a bad culture.
My culture, my everyday existence did not line up with the vision that I had for myself
And ultimately, I end up looking like someone that used to work out.
Great leadership works together to create a better tomorrow.
He says, seek the peace in the city that I've sent you to,
because when that city prospers, you'll prosper.
Sometimes that's making tough decisions.
Sometimes that's holding one another accountable.
Sometimes that's pressing into one another.
Sometimes that's encouraging one another in unique ways.
Representative Carpenter said that my son just signed an athletic scholarship to play football
at Georgia's Southern.
He also plays basketball and we're in the middle of the state basketball tournament.
A couple of games ago we were playing and our school starts three freshmen and two seniors.
My son is one of the seniors.
And at half time, one of the freshmen that is an exceptional player, they went to the
locker room, they came out, it was a guy on the other team that was just tearing us
up.
We couldn't stop him, had nothing for him.
And my son looked at the freshmen on our team and said, tell him what you told me coming
out of the locker room, well he hadn't told him anything.
And the freshmen looked at my son and said, what are you talking about?
He said, go ahead, tell him what you told me.
And he said, I don't know what you're talking about.
So my son looks at the opposing player that is tearing us up and says he said he's going
to kick your tail the second half.
Well, he went out and did that.
Sometimes we have to push one another, believe in one another, help one another.
That's what Jeremiah is saying.
Be the best you can be.
willing to take a risk, be willing to believe that culture can produce a reality, a vision
that we all hope to see happen. Again, I want to say to every single one of you, thank you.
Thank you for the courage to stand, to lead. I want to say thank you from my family,
with four children, how much I appreciate all that you do on a weekly and on a daily basis
to help the culture be established that helps us realize the vision of a better tomorrow
for Georgia.
Let's pray together.
Father, we're so thankful for the men and the women of this house.
Thank you for the leadership, leadership, House Speaker Rauston, those who lead.
I thank you, Lord, for the amazing gifts that are represented here.
men and women that understand that their decisions matter. I thank you for the wisdom in the direction.
I thank you for the conviction that they bring to these moments. And I pray that God that wisdom
and that conviction would be realized throughout this day and the remaining moments as they meet
together. Father, we lean into you and thank you for your peace and your grace that you give us
in these moments when we feel like God so many things are moving in different
directions. It's been a tough season for everybody in this room and for those
that we lead and we pray that God you would give us the wisdom and the
understanding to know how to lead well and we know you will in Jesus name.
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the
Republic, for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
Nor keepers will please unlock the doors.

Bob served eight years in the U.S. Marines before joining the U.S. Army, two and a half tours
in Vietnam, and served another 20 years in the Army.
worked as a civil servant, weapons manager, and he volunteered at Stockbridge
Veterans Administration, outpatient clinic, where he saw the need to get
veterans their benefits and therefore in 2011 started the veterans' support
group. And so we distinct Bob for his service, he's been a long-time hunter,

I ask you, please, let's honor him with a moment of silence.
Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Bigger.
Chair, recognizes Representative Burnow
for a morning order.
Chair, recognizes Representative Hutchinson
for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good morning, colleagues.
Today, I'm going to extend Black History Month just for a little bit.
I would like to introduce to you the first African-American instructor at Fort Gordon,
and also my father-in-law, Sydney Hutchinson.
Sergeant Hutchison was stationed in 1969 for his last station after the Korean War at Fort
Gordon when he was the first African-American instructor.
He taught signal corps, and after he retired, he became a licensed amateur radio operator
and was recognized as Ham Radio Operator of the Year in 2005.
He's a founding member of the East Augustine neighborhood watch.
He secured grants for the neighborhood watch, partnered with local police and businesses
to bring that community safety and security.
He volunteered for 30 consecutive years
at his church, Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Augusta,
and was recognized in 2002
with the Bishop John Barry Award
for Outstanding Volunteerism.
And in his 80s, he decided he was bored, I guess,
so he decided to take up ballroom dancing,
where he was also recognized in his 80s
as an outstanding ballroom dancer.
But I think his most important and prized roles
were father, husband, and papa to my kids.
I could not have asked for a better papa
and he left us and joined his wife in September of 2019.
So please help me recognize my father-in-law,

If county does not have any problems with flooding,
they can use it to lower, have the lower taxes.

bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed
Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 443.
House Bill 443 by Representative Leber to the 33rd.
We entitled back to men chapter 12 and title 51 of the fish, but a Georgia antenna relating the damages.
So it's to provide for new requirements for requiring the transfer of structured settlement payment rights.
This bill learned for the Committee on Judiciary.
That committee recommends that this bill do pass.
Representative Leveritt, you, last time you were in the well, you quoted Porter Wagner.
Is that right?
Yes, sir.
And then somebody last week was quoting you on Shakespeare, I can't wait for today.
Chair recognizes Representative Leveritt to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and Lady Jim, one of the House, I bring to you today House Bill
443, which is the Georgia Structured Settlement Protection Act.
It effectively allows this body to protect the disadvantaged from being taken advantage
of by the unscrupulous.
It deals with structured settlements, which are a rather obscure function in the law,
at least for my practice, it's a settlement in which instead of taking a lump sum payment
you sell your claim for payments over a period of time.
This does not regulate that process.
It regulates the process in which someone could subsequently
sell those rights.
And these are usually people who have undergone some kind
of great tragedy, oftentimes they're
miners who have lost both parents.
And the process of negotiating and determining
the value of that payment over time converted to a lump sum
payment can be rather technical and involves
rather complex financial formulas that most of us don't know.
So it's very easy for someone buying one of these
to take advantage of the person who's selling it.
So the purpose of this law is to amend
and update existing Georgia law
that already deals with this topic.
But it strengthens it.
It makes the disclosure's broader.
There's already a court approval process,
but this requires that all interested parties
be given notice so they can present arguments to the court.
And it generally just protects the consumer.
In effect, this bill allows this body to cast the wicked money
changers out of the temple.
If, in this case, the temple is a state of Georgia.
This act is already adopted in 48 to the 50 states.
And I understand that New Hampshire, the other state
is considering it this session, and they intend to have it
passed there.
So this would just update existing law, make it stronger,
make it more consumer protective, and bring us
the line with the vast majority of states who adopted this model act.
And I would also note that in rules, I received a question from Representative Williams
and he tells me that he is supporting the act.
And so that reminds me of Romans 8.13 if Representative Williams be with us, who can be against
this?
Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the well for questions.
just a lady of greatness awaits you. You do not appear to have any questions. Oh well
you do have a question. Chair recognizes the chairman of the House Ethics Committee.

Representative Williams to your left

Thank you, Mr. Speaker of the gentleman yield.
Ah, I would be glad to, sir.
That was not who I stewed, and that certainly was not my question.
Go ahead and ask your question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
And all the difference to my dear friend representative nicks, I would like to say I predict
based on what I heard, greatness for you in the future in this house.
Well, you're very kind, sir. Thank you so much.

to be entitled back to amend Article 5 of Chapter 36.
And Title 36, the official to Joe Jan Tate
relating to limitation on annexation of areas for nurse services or included in comprehensive zoning plans by certain counties.
This bill I would refer to the committee on governmental affairs that committee recommends that this bill do pass.
Chair recognizes Chairman Martin to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
House Bill 459 is very limited.
It applies to Charlie Brown Airport.
And it simply says that if any of the cities surrounding
that want to annex that property,
that they would wait and not do that
until they got a resolution from the county,
Fulton County, in this case, approving that annexation.
Fulton County's done a lot of investments.
The airport, it serves the region well.
And this is simply to keep those governments working together
and provide that airport.
I'm going to quote Franklin Roosevelt who said be sits there and be seated in part and
You'll the well if there are no questions
Look at that I finished before
You have no questions.
The gentleman yields the well.
Chair recognizes representative, I'm sorry,
Chairman Oliver, to speak to the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I support $459, but I want to bring to ladies and gentlemen
your attention House Bill 2324 and 66
that was given a very good hearing in government affairs.
And it all deals with issues that you are facing in your communities where there's growth
and competition and development authorities actions.
Many of the issues coming before the government affairs are about annexation procedures and
bond validations and the way in which our development authorities are or are not proceeding
with development.
the benefit and expense and it's a fair argument of your local elected officials.
What is true is that all cities and counties want development.
It's also true that all developing entities want tax benefits.
We have very few rules and very few statutes concerning the notification to our local communities,
our local school boards, our local counties
win a development authority as issuing bonds.
And I think this is a ripe area for us to discuss
in detail and at length.
And I appreciate the opportunity
that the government affairs, subcommittee chairs
and chairs have given me to bring these issues forward.
I just want to mention that the Fulton County Industrial
corridor in Fulton County has been the subject of litigation
since it was created in the 50s.
as an antiquated local legislation statute.
And the litigation that's going on around me
and in your counties too,
outside the perimeter,
is frequently about these issues of annexation,
issuance of bonds and development authorities.
I just wanna briefly mention, I support this bill,
but there's a wide array of issues
that I want us to further discuss in detail
for the purpose of transparency
and for the purpose of your local governments
being notified when these actions are coming before them.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Ladies, yielded the well.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
The Chair, here's none.
The previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report

Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 392.
House Bill 392, Bob Rosson.
Ridley, the six and others to be titled
an act to amend Title III, the fiscal to Georgia,
annotated related alcoholic beverages.
So to provide that licenses for retail sale packages
of alcoholic beverages for consumption off premises,
shall be subject to regulation as to distances from schools.
This bill then refer to the Committee on Regulated Industries.
That committee recommends that this bill do pass.
Chair recognizes representative Ridley to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Ladies and gentlemen, bring House Bill 392 to your attention for your consideration also.
What this bill does, this bill is not putting alcohol culture to schools.
What this bill is doing is giving the local authorities the ability, right now it's 200 yards,
it just gives the local authorities the ability to use that yard of genuine way they want to.
If you remember last year we had Ron Stevens bill down in Savannah, this is basically the same bill,
but it's got to do with school properties.
And we'll run into this situation as in rural areas where schools have 200-300 acres and
the schools on one corner, no convenience store or grocery store can go anywhere around
those that area if there's a road across there because of the 200 yard mark.
So this is just letting the local authorities do what they do, they issue the license already
and it's letting them have the authority to shrink that if they need to.
And that's the bill, Mr. Speaker.
Now, I have to answer any questions if I have you.
You do have a question if you care to yield.
Oh, you'll chair recognizes representative Carter up in the gallery for a question.
I think you speak of Austin.
Does the gentleman yield?
I sure did.
Go ahead.
In this bill, is there anything that would limit the distance
that a museum ask local government could put in the distance
between selling of the alcohol in one
of the additional approved locations that are listed?
So we can go from 200 to 10, or is there
something to eliminate?
There's not going to be anything to limit it.
Right now it's 200 yards, and so that
could go anything under that.
And like I said, if you've got a spot like where there's a
maintenance building or a school barn where there's not
even any kids, you still can't underlaw put a cell
alcohol at a convenience store or a gas station or anything
like that across the road from it.
So this just give them the authority to be able to have
that ability to move those lines.
Thank you.
Do you further yield?
I'll yield for one more.
Chair recognizes representative Anola Witts to your left
for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Does the gentleman yield?
I sure did.
So is it, could we say about this bill
that this is a bill that actually affirms local control?
It actually does, the firm local control.
Well, how wonderful.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Look forward to your vote.

of sort of Apollo 32 and others to be entitled and act to amend Chapter 5 and Title 40 and Chapter 13 and Title 43.
The official go to George Antietta relating to driver's licenses and driver's training schools respectively so as to reduce the number of required hours in the intervention component of DUI alcohol or drug use risk reduction programs has bill have referred to the committee on motor vehicles that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute.
Chair recognizes the chairman of the regulated industries committee chairman Powell to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen. This morning I bring to you House Bill 466.
This deals with the Department of Driver Services, driving schools and the DUI schools.
just does a handful of things other than just cleaning up a bunch of old and
redundant verbiage in the law. The number one, it changes the requirements of the
DUI schools from 20 to 16 hours. Been several questions. I was asked about that.
The research-based curriculum that's provided by these companies, they've been
changing this steadily from once upon a time it was 24, that it was 20, that it was 16 and it
gives them down to 10 for smaller courses. These are the DUI courses that the offenders take
and their recommendations, they have compiled these in short in the courses so they put more
components into it and from all evidence that these research based companies at the 16 hour
course is actually more effective because DUI fenders, they go at currently, they'll go eight hours
on a Saturday, eight hours on a Sunday, and then they're required to come back for a four-hour
on a Monday, which a lot of them aren't doing. So this consolidates and makes us more tightly
frame for these DUI fenders and is recommended by the research-based folks that write these
programs in the curriculum. Second thing it does, it allows for the driving improvement
schools to use the Zoom platform in this day and time of the viruses. You know, nobody
is really going into the classroom so it would allow the driving improvement schools to
use Zoom. It allows third-party testers to do road tests for non-students. A lot of
We all may remember that last year in the midst of this virus, DDS had such a terrible
time that they were actually giving the driver's licenses to teen drivers without them taking
a test and just come on back later on and take the test.
And this would eliminate that by putting third party testers approved by DDS out there
to test these students.
It allows third-party testers to be authorized by DDS after six months training.
And lastly, it just requires notification of the transfer of one of these driver improvement
schools that they have to notify the Department of Driver Services.
Mr. Speaker, that's the summation of this bill, and I would certainly appreciate the favorable
consideration.
Be glad to answer any questions if there are any.
You do not appear to have any questions.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
The chair hears none, the previous question is ordered.

Ladies and gentlemen, come before you with a very simple bill.
I know we keep hearing these simple bills.
And this one actually came through in 2012.
But the wording said you could have a alkaline hydrolysis
cremation device if you had a retort also.
So this is just saying you have one or the other.
This is recognized by Canada, the Cremation Association
of North America.
The Georgia Federal Directors Association has testified.
They had no opposition to it.
It's a smaller carbon footprint, very ecological friendly.
And it's also used at the University of Georgia
at their Department of Veterinary Services, Mr. Speaker.
So woof woof, what can I say?
Yeah, this is for Georgia and I ask for your favorable consideration and I'll take any questions, Ms. Speaker.
You have a question.

Representative Holkham to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does
gentleman yield? Yes, sir. Is it not true that there is no retort to this retort? That
is correct. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Chair recognizes representative Gloria Frazier
up in the gallery for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. That's gentleman Yeal. Yes, ma'am. Could
you please explain this bill again because I don't understand what it is. Okay, this is a method
of cremation where your standard and the usual retort is done by heat and flame. This is a
different method that is done through alkaline hydrolysis. This is a vessel that
actually chemicals are added and the remains are liquefied. The end result is
the same. It's like going whether you're going in a gasoline automobile or
electrical. Thank you. I got it. Thank you. Appreciate it.
Speaker, I don't think I need to take any more questions.
Well you have another one if you want to take one more. I'll finish thank you. All right

Thank you, Mr. Speaker,

I think I can guarantee that there won't be nearly as many
bad jokes from the Chamber as a result of this bill.
I rise to present House Bill 476,
which very simply the purpose and intent of this
is to allow the professional engineers and surveyors
of Georgia to govern themselves.
All other southern states do it this way.
We are removing them from under the governance
of the Secretary of State.
My long experience is a real estate practitioner
knows firsthand how this works with the real estate industry
being governed by the Georgia Real Estate Commission.
In summary, the professional engineers and surveyors
will be served well by this, but most importantly,
the consumers of Georgia who use their services
will be served well by it.
It's a good legislation and I would appreciate
your favorable consideration of this bill.

House Bill 539 by Representative Cooper, the 43rd to be entitled back to amend Article 2,
Chapter 34 of Title 43, the official go to Georgia and tell you relating the Medical
Practice Act and State of Georgia, so as to revise provisions relating to institutional
licenses. This bill I refer to the committee on Health and Human Services. That committee
recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes the chair of the Health and Human Services
Committee, Chairman Cooper, to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen,
the House, I bring you House Bill 539. About 20 something years ago, this body soft
that to institute and to pass a bill for the medical board where they would have be able
to grant something called an institutional license.
When the board made the rules to that bill, they said an institution was only a hospital.
This happened at a time when we were in war and there were some physicians coming from
some war torn countries that we thought we might be able to integrate them into our medical
system even though they did not have the same background as our medical
students and our physicians. It's been rarely used these days because of the
narrow word institution and how it was defined. The board has seen fit to work
with us and work with me and to expand that to an institution means a
hospital licensed by a Department of Community Health, a board approved
medical school, a teaching hospital in a state or a clinic in this state that
serves predominantly Medicaid, indigent, and underserved populations.
Over the years, this is not opening a floodgate.
We want really good doctors.
But it's giving a pathway from physicians from foreign countries that are good
doctors that just have a different way than different kind of medical education
background, a chance to work with another physician in their specialty area for
two to three years, and then the board has an chance to re-evaluate them to see if they
deserve and give them a free medical license that allows them to practice in our state.
We are turning away not dozens of really good physicians.
I recently was at Emory.
There was a young hematologist.
I always say the young doctors, oh, are you going to stay in Georgia when you finish?
She was doing a fellowship in hematology from the Middle East.
I said to her, oh, are you going to stay in Georgia?
She said, oh, I would really like to, but I can't get a license, a fellowship of two years
at Emory, and she can't get a license in our state.
So I would ask for your favorite behavioral consideration of House Bill 539 and Mr. Speaker
if there are no questions, I'll yield the well.
You do not have any questions.

Chair recognizes representative McDonnell to present the bill.
Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House, I bring before you House Bill 453.
453 is a firefighter tag bill and in this legislation was developed back in the early
the only change, main change in this is striking one word which could make it complex but I don't think it does.
That it changes the word on line 14, striking personal, making it available that firemen that have a vehicle through their LLC
that on their two days off that they go and do yard work or do maintenance somewhere that they're able to put a firefighter tag on that vehicle.
that vehicle. Right now, they can only put it on a vehicle that is owned by them, not
an LLC. A firefighter tag is assigned to the firefighter. It's not assigned to a company.
It's not assigned to a vehicle. So it always stays with that firefighter. So currently, if
a fireman's in this situation, he can only put it on his wife's car, which she's now
driving around with the firefighter tag and not the firefighter. There's some cleanup
legislation that went in some words in here through Lead Council on end to the bill, but
the gesture of the bill is about making it where these firefighters can put it on their
vehicle that they drive every day. So in closing, I want to remind everyone that firefighters
save more than homes. They save hearts, memories, and dreams. Mr. Speaker, ask for a favorable
consideration on this bill. I yield for any questions.
