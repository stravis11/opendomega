You
You
Committee on Retirement to Order.
This is Tuesday, June 13th, and Senator Harbin, how about
I'll lead us in a word of prayer, please.
Yeah, me, thank you.
Okay, let's pray.
Lord, we thank you for just the opportunities
that you give us.
We ask your father for wisdom and discernment
as we deal with the business of the state of Georgia.
And when we represent our citizens well
and their best interest and those that serve us.
Thank you for your love and your faithfulness to us.
We want to thank you in Christ's name, amen.
Amen.
Okay, first we're going to hear from Senator Albert.
We'll let you is at Senate Bill 328 and your LC number.
432834ER.
All right.
Floor's yours, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
I remember.
The committee, I appreciate the honor to present this bill in front of you.
A little background on the POAB, which is the police officer, a new identity benefit fund.
fund. It's one of the most successful ones not just in the state but in the
nation. It is led by someone who is no stranger when this room is Mr.
Homer Bryson behind me. We have a great team of people and the sole purpose of
this is without using state tax dollars. We repeat that without using state
tax dollars. We have a pension fund that helps our post-certified police
officers in all corners of the state. It doesn't matter where you live. Each one
of them as long as they maintain their post credentials and pay their dues can participate
in this fund. While it looks like there's a lot of pages here, it's a lot of technical
cleanup actually. So you'll see a lot of things struck it out with just updating and modernizing
some language, but the bill does do a couple of basic things. It improves some benefits
for members which I'll talk about. The members themselves pay a $25 a month dues, they're
going to increase their own dues to $35.
And the goal with all these updates
is then for you to hopefully bless it today
to go for an actuary study, which we believe will actually
come back a very favorable base in the modeling
that Mr. Bryson and his team have already done.
So you'll see under the administrative changes
very briefly that this is in line with the definitions
we use for the Post Council, which
is police officer standard in training.
It changes other job titles and duties
the board but again just making it clean and consistent with what we do in other
places. The other thing it does is it matches the service requirements for folks
who can buy back years of pension that didn't perform from five to seven years.
Continuing on the cost will be calculated for them to buy back years at what the
full actuary cost will be. As you know Mr. Chairman and committee members we
have a shortage of those who are willing to serve in law enforcement over the
last several years especially and what this is going to do is allow those that
have vested in the plan for 30 years to be able to receive their pension but
also remain employed in the public safety arena why they get their P.O.E. pension.
It doesn't penalize them for coming back to work when more than ever we need
good experience and tenured officers to serve. The death benefits today are
are $3,500 with restrictions that will upgrade to $5,000
without restrictions.
Similarly, the wine of duty deaths will increase
from $5,500 of restrictions to $10,000
without restrictions.
One last change to the fund will be that if someone decides
that opt out of membership to the fund,
that they will get all their dues paid back to them
in full that they put into the fund.
So again, we believe that this will be a favorable
analysis from the actuaries with the increase of the $10 per month.
This is run for our officers, by officers, and the folks engaged again and have one of
the best plans in the nation.
And I'd ask that you would give us a favor of consideration going to the next part of
the process.
And I would yield for any questions.
Thank you.
Do we have any questions from any board member?
Senator Harvey?
I don't know.
Thank you, appreciate that.
Senator Albus,
question, the buyback was mentioned.
So someone can be in it as I understand it
and they can pay back if they were not there
for the number of years they can buy those years back.
Can you come and give me help?
Yeah, there's two points there.
So if they were not involved in the fun,
they can go back and buy back up to seven years,
five to seven years with that to pay the full actuary cost
of what it would be at that time.
It's not just, you know, five years times the monthly fee.
It's what would have accrued during that time.
But then if somebody was in the system for, say, 11 years,
and they decided they wanted to opt out,
they could opt out and get their dues back.
Okay.
We would certainly hope they would never do that
because it's a pretty good return on investment.
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you.
Let's see, Chairman Tulleray.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thanks, Chairman Edwards.
I just got a couple of questions.
Do we know, and maybe this is something
procedurally that I'm out of order on.
The, we go for the actual oral study
after voting through this meeting today.
So that one we would know how many people are eligible now
and how many people would be eligible in the future.
Would that be a fair question asked now?
Is that something that could go later on?
If I could bring up Mr. Bryson to give me an assist, yes.
Sure.
And using round numbers and good morning, Mr. Chairman.
How are you?
In using round numbers, we've got about 14,000 active members in the fund now.
We're paying monthly pension to close to 8,000 individuals.
We're paying out $4.65 million a month in retirement pensions.
And again, this does not change the eligibility into the fund.
So we don't see that this would make a huge change in what our membership status is.
So we, and then after the actual aerial study is that when we find out how many would be
covered by a new or, is there a, is there a report that comes later that tells us that
I'm, I'm just wondering from a procedure standpoint.
I'm not sure that this will change our numbers greatly.
I think really what we're looking to do here is clean up this, this code was could put
in place in the 50s and it's been added to and for decades and we're cleaning up and
modernizing the code basically, and we've changed some of the application process, sort
of streamline that, and we're looking to simplify our death benefit.
And to also streamline our by-back plan, our current by-back plan is you have to join
and be a member for five years.
Then you can buy back up to five years, but you have to work however long you buy back,
it does not count towards vesting. And so what we want to do, what we've heard from our members is,
once they join, they would prefer to be able to buy back day one and just pay the full actuarial
cost and then it count towards vesting. Gotcha. Can I ask one more question, Mr. Chairman?
One of the things that I've heard of, y'all probably got the emails too, is about some disparities
about maybe how we treat our state officers versus county officers and others and some
of these plans with death benefits.
I know that your plan is more than death benefits and I know that also your plan is self-funded
essentially by its members and is different.
But one of the things I might be looking at is seeing if what the change might be if
we had to make that death benefit be equal across all those who are in public
safety. So if that's something we can look at and see if that would how that
would be affected by the actual numbers I'd love to see that if it doesn't work
I completely understand because your members are funding it themselves it's not
being funded with state general funds but I'm gonna be curious about that as it
moves forward through this session. And thank you I'd like to add to that because
as I'm passionate as you are equally,
every department is different, right?
Whether it be a state, city, county,
or even school system for a safety resource officer,
so each one of them have their own benefits,
but there is also a state benefit
that's separate any federal benefit,
especially if it's a line of duty death.
The question that I think we should look at a little further,
and I'd love to speak with you offline,
is states like Florida and Oregon and some other areas
have taken that a little bit further, really for the non-line of duty benefits.
And the reason for that is, is the rate for someone in public safety to have heart disease
is three and a half times greater than average person.
And many of you know Lance Russo, who is really one of the leading attorneys to represent
public safety members throughout the state of Georgia, I'll quote his statistics that
the average person in their life will have a post-traumatic stress event, right?
We think of PTSD mostly from our combat soldiers.
We hope it doesn't get to the D,
but the average human being, all of us,
will have four of those throughout a lifetime,
a post-traumatic stress event.
A combat veteran can have as many as 100.
A public safety person experiences an average of 700
in their lifetime.
700.
So if you think about what that means to their physical body,
to their mental capabilities, to what it impacts
to their families, et cetera.
They see three bad things.
They have to go to the next call immediately.
And it's the next day.
It's the next shift.
It's the next whatever.
So the things we do to help support them and serve them.
And this Senate has led the way with the peer support
group and all the other work we did.
I think we still have to do more of those.
So thank you for your question.
I'd love to work with you on that.
Okay.
Senator Harvin?
Sir, I was just understanding, as I see,
the summary. The options, of course, are a life settlement, a joint settlement, or a joint
settlement with a reduced monthly benefit. I don't see in the summary sheet that we have
the life insurance side of it, and I'm assuming the two, I'll give you two questions. If someone
has a life annuity, once they die, that annuity goes away, they're not, they're not, they're not
joint their single life only, but there's a death benefit also that goes with that.
I don't see the death benefit at least a number. Is that number based upon their account value?
Or how is that determined?
Make sure I understand your question. Are you referring to the death benefit?
Death benefit, yes.
Death benefit will either go to a spouse or in a state.
How is it calculated was my question?
Well currently that's there's a lot of caveats that go with it and how long you remember how
much you've received and retirement benefits. We're wanting to do away with that and just have it
if you're if you are a member in good standing and you pass away you've got those two dollar
amounts certain. Okay okay so rather than some calculation on the account value that you're pulling
down it's going to be a fixed amount. That's correct. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Is anyone
else wish to speak to Bill? Hearing none, what is the desire of the committee? Move due pass.
We have a move to pass, Senator McClaren.
Can I clarify is that motion for an actuary to move it forward to an actuary?
If that is the motion, then I second that motion.
So we have a second.
In a discussion, all in favor say aye.
So, Carrie.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, members of the committee.
appreciate your unwavering support of all of our police officers and sheriff's baths state.
Thank you so much.
Next we have Senate Bill 322 from Senator Walker.
He was not able to be here.
Do we have someone that can present that bill?
If you want to present it to Ricka, but stand by just a moment.
you present this bill for Senator Walker since he's not here. I know you're
excited about this. Mr. Chairman, I am excited about this. I'm more excited to see
all of you interrupting your summer on our behalf. So thank you for that. I am
Terry Norris. I'm a few things. You all know me as the executive director of the
Georgia Sheriff's Association, but also happened to be the Secretary of
treasure of the Sheriff's Retirement Fund of Georgia.
This is a public retirement fund, of course in code.
It's created for the elected sheriff.
There are no state funds that contribute to the fund.
Presently there are 199 retirees with an average monthly pension of $2,713.80.
So we're asking in this bill, Senator Walper, I should say is asking in this bill to make
several increases in the current, some of the current details of the bill, prior service.
Presently, you can buy up to eight years prior service if you've had military.
You can buy up to four years military and up to four years of law enforcement experience.
That current buyback is $37.50.
We're asking for that buyback to be increased to $65.
And the second thing we're asking for is dues.
They pay the sheriffs, pay dues monthly into their fund.
Current dues, all this hasn't been changed in many years.
Current dues are $45 and we're asking that to be increased to $65.
Recently, there is no collection of any fees on pre-adjudicated cases.
You know, in the past 10 or 12 years, this General Assembly and our governor has agreed
and said that we should do things to help people avoid conviction.
And there's been a lot of pre-adjudicated cases where they've been allowed, these defendants
have been allowed to do other things rather than be convicted.
And that happened a lot of the fine revenues that were going into our shares retirement
fund.
And likewise, the Peace Officer and Newty and Benefit fund that you just spoke of, there
was a lot of fees that were lost.
So we're asking to do something similar to what you all did for the Peace Officer and
Newty and Benefit fund a few years ago.
I think there's those $5 on each case, on these pre-judicative cases, excuse me.
In this particular bill, we're asking for a $2 fee on each of those cases.
On the service of civil papers, the current fee that's collected on the service of papers
by sheriff's offices is $1.
We're asking that to be increased to $5.
We're asking that if there's a felony conviction of a retired, excuse me, an elected sheriff,
then related to the performance of duties as a sheriff, that the retirement board, sheriff's
retirement board, be allowed to consider removing those benefits from that particular person.
That takes place, of course, later on, does not affect any sitting sheriff.
And finally, really the origination of the bill, Chairman Tillery, had to do with the
death benefit.
And we originally asked, excuse me, the current death benefit for the sheriff's family in
the case of the death of the sheriff or the retired sheriff is $15,000 and we're asking
that to be increased to $35,000.
Mr. Chairman, that's all I have to say about it at this point.
Again, we appreciate your time this morning and allowing us to interrupt your summer break
For the record. This is Senate bill 322
LC number 432823
There's any questions from any member
The
Yeah, let's see
I'm a 13
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and good to see you.
Thanks a lot.
I guess Senator Harbor and I were calling it a,
it's got that reunion feel, right?
But it's a mild reunion feel, right?
There's only a couple of months, so.
We need to ease back into it.
Yeah, right, exactly.
Got a question about the new $2 off of pre-trial diversion.
So my understanding is under statute.
That's a fee that the local jurisdiction imposes
and it's a maximum of $300.
I don't know, that subsection F is that you're
understanding here.
Honestly, I'm not familiar with that part of the
current law.
It's outside the realm of this particular bill, I believe.
OK, we'll write.
I mean, this is so often our convenience, the bills,
or the statutes we cross reference
don't show up in full text in the bill,
so we have to do a little googling.
But this is OCGA 15, 18, 80.
So I'm looking at line 76-387 of this bill.
And it's referring to the fee collected there
and subsection F says the prosecuting attorney
shall be authorized to assess and collect
from each offender who enters the program
of fee not to exceed $300 for the administration of the program.
And then it says any fee collected under the subsection
shall be made payable to the general fund
of the political subdivision in which the case is being prosecuted.
So right now the local government gets whatever that fee is
by statute and this would be a carve out.
I guess, so you sort of have answered my question already by saying it's outside of the realm
of this bill, but I guess I am curious about how this works in practice.
I mean, do we have any information about whether local jurisdictions are already maxing out
that fee at 300?
Do we know if, on average, they're doing lower?
Do we know which jurisdictions have maxed out the 300 fee?
I guess is they're all maxing it out because I think the concept behind that 300 as I recall
that conversation now was to help all set, further all set the cost of running the accountability
courts and other costs related to that local jurisdiction after the court has imposed
whatever that those provisions are to pay the cost of dealing with that particular situation.
That's only a guess.
If you and I had to make a guess together a day,
I think we'd arrive at the same guess.
Yes, sir.
Is there a representative of counties or cities
that can speak to this change,
where they informed about the change?
Me, I'm just curious with what their position is
or how they would explain the use of those funds.
We have not talked to them.
Again, we modeled this after current law
on the related to the POAB fund.
Okay, so.
Yeah, I guess my two main concerns with this provision
are number one, I'm always opposed to trying to fund government
on the backs of people who go through criminal legal system
in the ways of fines and fees.
I'm generally in no vote on that.
And so any risk that this type of legislation
would expand that practice is going
to be concerning to me, and the second concern
is the local governments.
Because putting to the side my sort of crazy liberal
or philosophical objection to the use of fines and fees
in that way, if the local governments
are trying to use those funds and fees and productive ways
to your point, maybe for accountability courts,
that sort of thing, that's at least a discussion
that I would want to see had before we make any changes
to the allocation of those funds.
So that's my hang up, but I respect the goal,
obviously immensely, and I understand, too,
the price has gone up since the 1950s and 60s
when we're writing some of this legislation, so.
Yes, sir.
Appreciate it, thank you.
Thank you.
Let's see, Senator, yes.
All right, thank you very much.
Just quickly, this new code section,
can you kind of elaborate on this?
If a sheriff is convicted of a felony,
if you can go over that with me again.
And then the other thing, I know these are retirees.
And the active members of an agreement
were raising their own membership dues from $45 to $65, $20.
Yes, ma'am.
Oh, OK.
So the other part, your first question, dealt with the provisions about conviction, convicted
sheriffs who are convicted of felony offenses that are related to the operation of the office
of sheriff.
That's what it, in a nutshell, that's what it is.
So if you, I mean, there could be multiple examples of what that might mean.
But it is holding the elected sheriff responsible for his or her behavior.
And if they use their position as sheriff to undermine the public trust, to steal from
the office, to do those things that would constitute a felony, then the sheriff's retirement
fund board could take action to eliminate the payment of all or part of those later
retirement benefits. And now that is a general response. And it's pretty broadly written
if you see that as well. So yes, ma'am.
Senator Tillery. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Three things, one sort of ingest. I thought Mr.
Vaughn might want to speak for the counties if he'd like to say anything I'll ever have.
That's time to pass. That's time to pass. Two things though that I would like to address
this comes back up again. It looks like the way it's drafted that if a conviction on the felony
provision that Senator Diamondport brought up earlier, if it's flipped, that then the back payments
are made with interest to the person whose conviction was vacated. But it looks and I may be reading
this wrong. It looks like during the appeal process, the person has their funds back, then if the
appeal is reinstated to the Senate, that we then go back to get those monies again, just from a
The practical standpoint has been my experience
that those funds are no longer there when you go back.
So that might be something that the fund wants
to look at just practically.
I actually chairman, they did talk about that
and they did recognize that as they were discussing this.
And honestly, if there was a way to strengthen
this particular provision which likely would not affect
the actuary if we get that moved along for an actuary study,
they certainly would welcome any suggestions
ways to improve that particular provision if it didn't otherwise damage or hurt
right and progression of the bill also acknowledge the you know American
standard of innocence will prove in guilty I guess you're proving guilty then
to flip I don't know how we would remedy that but I bring that up for your
consideration and thoughts as we move forward the last is Mr. Sherman I don't
know the procedure again on when we refer this out do we have to refer the bill
out in whole or do it can we prefer the bill out with questions for the
actuary to essentially bring back in parts. How does that work? And is there
anyone in the room that can answer that question for me?
Okay.
When you come up and identify yourself, please.
Terry, if you will read her Miranda writes to us.
I have the right to remain silent.
Good morning, I'm Carol Schwini with the Department of Audits.
And with regards to your question, Chair Montellery, what we can do is we would have to submit the bill
As as written or as perfected if there are certain components of the bill that you want to remove that you're not interested in studying
But we do want to make sure that the the first actuarial investigation that comes out is the highest cost
that you can have because any bill that is amended later if the bill, if the cost of the bill increases, then the bill would automatically be done.
So we do want to make sure that if there are pieces of the bill that you are looking at costing, I would recommend that you include them in the bill.
So if there's revenue enhancers in the bill, if we wanted to make worst case scenario, we should strike those provisions out,
Knowing that the report we get back from you would be the worst possible in any revenues
we added back.
For instance, like Senator McLaren's comment about the issue he had with fees for accountability
courts.
We would want to strike that provision knowing that if we added that $2 back, it simply
makes the feasibility and the dollar health, I'm saying that in a poor way, better for
us.
Now, also though I would say that if the Senate is interested in having some additional
information that's outside of the words in the bill, you can submit a request to the
State Auditor's Office and we specifically identify in what you would like the actuary
to study specific to maybe a secondary question and they can come back with that information
at the same time the answer follow-up.
Can I ask a follow-up on that, Mr.
If the that secondary question cost more money,
have we killed the bill for the two-year cycle?
Yes.
Okay. So we want to make this the highest cost possible.
That is correct. But the secondary question is just a secondary question
and it's not necessarily bill specific.
It's just information for you all to gather information.
And so if you all were wanting to pull out, for example, the $2 fee, but you wanted
that information, you could request the actuary study that specifically.
So you have that information up front as you're seeing the initial cost of the original
actuary investigation.
And Carol, what about it?
Put you on the spot.
Is that your recommendation on what we should do if we don't want to kill the purposes
of not killing the bill?
I mean, it would be helpful.
It's just a matter of whether or not the Senate is willing to pay for the additional costs related to the extra work of the actuary, because the cost of the actuarial investigations are cost of the legislature.
Okay. Any other questions of the expert witness?
I understand what that means, ma'am.
Senator Harbin.
Thank you, sir.
Just looking at this, of course we're looking for the actual real study.
And the last comment was, is that my question would be, is that the fees that are being increased for members versus the fees that are collected?
percentage is that currently in place, from a standpoint, is it 90, 80, 90, 10, what's
our percentage or do we know?
Well, currently you've got a membership cost and then you've got a fee that you're charged
that would be charged for $2 each.
Is that new?
just currently, member only, are we still getting a dollar from the court cost?
Is that what I understand?
There's fines and fees that are already being collected.
Collected. Okay. Yes, sir.
But percentage-wise, is it 90% coming from the members and 10% coming from fees?
I would say there's a higher percentage coming from fees than members, but I don't know what the percentage is.
Okay.
Through the courts.
Through the courts.
You don't know the number off the top of your head.
I'm top of my head now, but actually I can pull the actuarial study and find that information out and send it to you.
But I understand Senator Utility, what he was saying is that if I understand we may want to amend this in committee to deal with that issue so that if it comes back, it doesn't die in this session, am I correct?
What I was saying was that you want to make sure that the bill that you sent to the act
where he initially is going to be the highest cost that would be incurred.
And then once you get that information back, you can amend the bill so that the cost decreases
and that bill could stay live.
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you.
Chairman Taylor.
You ready to make a motion when you're ready, Mr. Chairman?
Okay.
Legislative Council that you want to weigh in on the page four,
there's some things that Brad had picked up.
I wanted to bring that out on the page four.
Um, client 89, what is your number down there?
How I feel press a button.
There you go.
I was brought to my attention in line 89 where it references the Secretary
Treasurer under subsection A of this code section.
She'll fail to remit because we added subsection B in there.
We would want this to apply kind of these penalties and deadlines to apply to both
A and B the new the new subsection for two dollars if we're gonna remove that
It would be moved at this time, but if we're gonna keep that section
Three in the bill then we wouldn't want to add or B after
A in line 89
Okay
Go kitchen. Okay. All right. Thank you
right chairman
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I
would move that
we send
LC432823
with sections three and four
stricken
forward for an actuarial study and
Defer to the expert witnesses again. I think I've struck the provisions that were additional fees, but for the member
Contributed fees that Mr. Norse is already spoken to have been accepted by the members
You want to repeat the motion
Have a motion in a second the other discussion and
And Mr. Chairman, I'm happy to explain why I did that if the members need to, but if
they understand I won't, do you understand what they could do?
Do you need explanation, Terry?
I would like so, but we can do it all for why, and it doesn't matter.
Yeah, I don't mind doing it on the record since it's a bill, probably.
Mr. Norris, what the striking that does is it makes the actuarial study come back at
the highest possible amount so that if we later add those fees back in, that it lowers
the actual value which keeps the bill alive. However, if we were to strike those provisions
later on after the actual aerial study, we will have killed the bill for the two-year cycle.
So it keeps it alive if there were changes that would have made about those two matters.
I don't know if you're interested in that part.
Thank you.
We're the opinion that it would meet act as well standards with those in there, but we
certainly respect the decision of the committee.
Yeah, I haven't talked to you more about it offline.
Okay.
Thank you.
Any other discussion?
Any other questions?
Is there anyone here that wanted to speak for, I guess, this bill?
We ignore the discussion all in favor of the motion.
Say aye.
Aye.
Any opposed?
So carry.
So now to present this bill for actuary as amended.
I have a motion on that.
I'm moved to pass.
I have a motion and second in your discussion.
All in favor say aye, so carry.
So that's going to be moving forward to it.
Thank you very much, thank you.
Any other measures before this committee,
if not, we'll stand adjourned.
Thank you.
I love it.
Yes.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
