TRANSCRIPT
----------
Okay. The party's gone, but it's quality that's here now, all right. Well, we are already
late, and we'll probably continue to be late the rest of the day. So, Mr. Secretary,
glad you're here. Welcome and we will get right to work. Turn it over to you.
Good afternoon, Chairman Hatchett, Chairman Tillery, members of the committee. Thank you
for the opportunity to present the Secretary of State's amended fiscal year, 2026 and
fiscal year 2027 budget recommendations.
Beginning on page 330, the governor's budget recommendation booklet, these proposals
are focused on maintaining secure elections, protecting consumers, supporting licensed
professionals, and ensuring our agency continues to operate efficiently and responsibly.
Our budget reflects careful stewardship of taxpayer dollars while addressing statutory
mandates and operational needs.
Slide 2 is on page 331.
The Corporation Division plays a critical role in supporting entrepreneurs across the
state and making Georgia more prosperous and affordable for all.
In 2025, we processed 898,883 annual registrations with 1.4 million active entities on record,
highlighting Georgia's leadership and successful business practices.
We're expecting a substantial increase in those numbers within the next year.
We served the state by accepting filings, issuing corporate documents and providing corporate
access to business records.
On slide two here, you'll see the only recommended change in AFY26 is a one-time 2,000 supplement
for full-time employees to remain competitive and recognize staff retention needs.
There are no requested changes for FY27, allowing the division to maintain consistent operations
while continuing to serve Georgia's business community.
Slide 3 is on page 331 also.
The elections division is responsible for administering Georgia's election laws and supporting
voters, candidates, and local government statewide.
In 2025, we successfully administered and certified all elections while upholding our commitment
to keep Georgians safe and secure while they recognized their right to vote.
So much so that Fox News on Election Night on Fall of 2024 said that Georgia and Florida
run the best elections in the entire country.
I differ with him on one point, Georgia runs the best elections in the entire country.
In AFY-26, the budget includes several key investments, a one-time employee salary supplement,
funding for optical character recognition, human readable text count technology to comply
with Senate Bill 189.
A second blind count of all ballots and resources for the 159 counties to conduct a full hand
recount of two statewide elections during the 2026 cycle.
These funds strengthen elections integrity, transparency, and public confidence.
We are requesting that these funds be made recurring to ensure Georgia can continue to
conduct audits that verify election outcomes that reinforce voter confidence.
Slide four also on page 331.
The Investigations Division enforces laws related to elections, securities, professional
licensing.
For AFY-26, budget adjustments reflect changes in insurance premiums, Georgia Outwork
Billings, and updated health-benefit contribution rates.
While these are primarily technical adjustments, they ensure the division remains properly
resourced to investigate complaints and protect Georgia consumers.
consistently upholding our commitment to keeping Georgian safe and just this year alone we've had
thousands of successful investigations across all divisions and attached agency's divisions.
On slide five also on page three three one this discusses an office administration who provide
essential support services across the entire agency. In AFI 26 the budget includes a one-time
2000 salary supplement for full-time employees. This investment supports
retention and recognizes the importance of administrative staff who ensure
the agency operates smoothly. Slide 6 is the Professional Licensing Division
which protects public health and safety by supporting licensing boards across
numerous professions. Our most recent update has been the online application
tracker, giving our constituents access to streamlined time view, timeline to review
their application status 24-7. Additionally, we've reduced processing time for our
constituents to receive nursing licenses, for example, by 62%. Cutting the
average processing time from 48 days down to 18 days, proving our office's
efficiency and commitment to our health care professionals.
In AFY26, the budget includes a one-time salary supplement for employees who support licensing
operations.
This funding helps ensure timely processing, enforcement, and customer service for licensees,
licensees, and the public.
The Securities Division is discussed here on slide 7, page 332.
They administer enforced Georgia's Securities Charitable Solicitations and Cemetery's Act.
Our office is extremely dedicated to Georgians and protecting Georgians, and we've hosted
over 49 different financial literacy programs over the past year.
Actually, we've even gone into women's prisons to ensure that our constituents are prepared,
educated and well-versed on the potential threats they could face.
We perhaps actually were in your account recently or in the past year.
We plan to continue to host these vital programs this year with two events that are actually
happening just this week.
And AFY-26, the requested increase supports a one-time salary supplement for full-time
employees.
This ensures the division remains equipped to protect investors and prevent financial fraud.
On slide 8, this discusses FY27 recommendations.
These adjustments were largely reflect updated benefit
and administrative cost changes including retirement contributions,
insurance premiums, and Georgia at work buildings.
We also reflect savings from reduced state health benefit
playing contribution and the eliminate elimination
of one-time precedent card mailing funds following
following the passage of Senate Bill 424.
Overall, these adjustments ensure fiscal responsibility
while sustaining core election operations.
The FY recommendations continue these adjustments
on slide nine, reflecting updated administrative
and benefit cost.
The overall reduction lines with protected expenditures
while preserving the division's ability
conduct investigations and enforcement actions statewide. Additionally, we are
requesting $755,649 in funds for salaries to reflect similar law enforcement
agencies and staff for our post-certified investigators. Slide 10 on page 333,
the fiscal year 27 adjustment reflect routine changes in insurance premiums, telecommunications,
and infrastructure rates, and Georgia at work buildings. These are partially offset by savings
from reduced health benefit contribution rates. The goal is to maintain strong internal operations
while remaining fiscally streamlined. On slide 11 relating to professional licensing on page 333
and 334, the recommended changes for fiscal year 27 reflect updated administrative cost
and reduction in state health benefit contributions. These adjustments result in a net decrease
while still allowing the division to meet its regulatory responsibilities, maintain a high
level of customer service. On slide 12 relating to securities on page 334, the FY27 recommendations
include routine adjustments for insurance, Georgia Outwork Billings, and reduced health benefit
contribution rates. These changes result in a modest net reduction while preserving the
division's ability to conduct examinations, investigations, and enforcement actions.
In closing, our AFY26 and AFY and Fiscal Year 27 budget recommendations reflect a balanced
approach, supporting our employees,
being statutory obligations, strengthening election
integrity, and protecting Georgia consumers
all while maintaining fiscal discipline.
We appreciate your consideration and look forward
to continue our work on behalf of the people of Georgia.
With that, I would answer any questions
the committee or members would have.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Secretary, I have one or two questions.
I noticed that you reported, I think fiscal year 25,
that you all had collected around 144 million in fees.
Does that include the expedited charges
that you collect for those fees?
In the past, I don't think it has, but I'm just curious if it has.
Do you have any idea?
Yeah, that's included.
It is, include those.
So those, all those expedited fees are then
turned into the general fund that we then
have the ability to.
That's part of our retained revenue.
The general summary receives 100% of the standard
corporation fee and of the professional licensing fee, if we charge a license, say $100, we run
the agency on about $33 and the other 65% goes back to the General Assembly.
It goes back where?
To the General Assembly.
Okay.
I just have an issue with all of our agencies at charge fees that we don't get to see.
Well, we're running the corporations on zero taxpayer dollars.
but you are. Okay. Senator Burns. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Secretary.
Good to see you today. Thanks for joining us. As we look at your request for $1.8 million
for the text-based ballot scanning technology, can you share with me that whether that software
would be used for tabulation or verification.
That's actually used for verification.
That's what we piloted back in the 2024 election.
That's correct.
Reading the human readable text.
And this reflects the governor's budget of the $1.8 million
and the $5 million that he put in there.
Correct, and I support that and champion that.
My point is, you notice here this is for tabulation.
Is that incorrect?
It confirms the tabulation.
Text-based ballot is going to technology for vote tabulation.
Is it EAC certified for tabulation?
On an election day, the poll workers will obviously the voters run their paper ballots
through the scanners and the scanners record that with the QR code.
In post-election, we take those scanned images, and we run that through and verify what
those numbers are, the vote totals, raised by race, and the totals to verify the accuracy
of the machine, the accuracy of the vote.
So it's really as a check, you know, it is a verification, is that correct?
It's a verification.
All right, and you use the word QR code.
I believe Senate Bill 189 does not allow for the use of QR code after July 1st, 2000
in 2006. Is that true? The system that we're using currently is available to be used until
June 30th, 2026. Correct. Thank you. The last question in this line, what was the cost,
the actual cost of providing that verification text-based scan in 2024?
I will get the number for you, but it was in excess of the $1.8 million because there
were set up costs.
I believe the legislature at that time appropriated $5 million, is that correct?
Right, and it came in under that.
And it came in under that substantially, I believe.
Yes.
So if you would please, I'd like to know what the actual cost was to utilize that technology
in 2024.
We'll send that to the chair to verify that it's a verification of the tabulations that correct. We'll send this information to the chairman and members. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I appreciate your service.
Chairman Yerda.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for being with us. You know, we made significant changes to have professional licensing boards operate and
and particularly moving some of the authority to you guys inside and you
anticipate you have the resources needed to smoothly make this transition and
I know you've made some improvements already as I'm like but the further you
know make those improvements and make it a smooth transition for our
constituents you anticipate that's going to be workable.
Well, restating that, you mentioned that how you've moved something to the professional
licensing.
Yeah.
It's really the same as it's always been.
There's some of those decisions made internally now by the authority itself.
Oh, I see what you're talking about, right.
That helps those expedite the approval of a license if you met all the qualifications
and that speeds things up.
But the most important thing is really the technology upgrade.
We've taken software.
The old software was clunky 2002 software.
That's been replaced fully implemented.
And now you're seeing, like for example, nurses,
our largest group of licensed professionals went from 48
down, days, down to 18 days.
And I'm happy to report our employees are dedicated.
And now they're trying to reduce it even further.
And I'm not going to stop them.
Because they're on a mission just to be more efficient.
I really serve, you know, your constituents,
our constituents across the state of Georgia.
Thank you.
Chairman Bill Zoll.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, thank you, Mr. Secretary.
I was just looking back through Senate Bill 189
to make sure my recollection was correct.
So, and I want to just try to get down to a clear answer
to the question that Chairman Burns was asking.
In November of this year, when our voters cast votes,
What are we certifying? Are we certifying a ballot that is being tabulated with the QR code or not?
Well
The challenge that you have is the Senate this general assembly has not funded a single dollar to upgrade the system
So if you do fund, you know that system then we could talk about alternatives
but it's not been funded and it's not reflected in the governor's budget.
And so we're here reflecting what the governor has, you know, put in here and pending, you
know, some funding from the General Assembly will be, you know, having to make this choice
come November.
I follow, Mr. Chairman.
In addition to that, can you, when we vote in November and in May, what version of the
Dominion software, our machines be running.
Five, five, five?
Yeah.
For up to June 30th, it would be five, five.
What about after June 30th?
With lack of funding, you'll be faced a choice
that we probably would have to use five, five, or some other alternative.
There's no funding been put forward by the General Assembly.
assembly. And just to clarify 555A is the version of the software which says
the Department of Homeland Security have identified have the nine known
vulnerabilities that they identified back in 2022. Is that correct? And since
that time now we do the human readable text verification. And when we did
the verification of that we found that there was basically zero errors with the
human readable text and I believe it was 84 errors with the hand mark. I was
I was just asking to clarify, that's the same version of the software that is the same software version that the Department of Homeland Security identified had those nine vulnerabilities.
That's 5.5a, I just want to make sure my number is correct.
We're using the same software because I know additional funding has been provided.
Thank you Mr. Secretary.
question all of that. The 5 million in the governor's budget does that go for the
hand recount them? That goes for the hand recount of two additional
state two not two additional but two statewide races. So it doesn't do it doesn't
I was under the impression the five million was going to be we'll be able to
count all of them. No no that's no this is just for two statewide races. Would
if we were able to count all of them, would you not just be able to certify the
hand count there and that suffice to meet the Senate Bill's request of not counting
the QR code? No, because you have about 16 to maybe 20 races on each ballot. Now
you're just looking at two races that are on that ballot. So really it's the
economy of what it is. It's not like France or Germany or any of these other
democracies which just have one race, we actually have say 15 different races on a ballot.
What would be the incremental cost increase than the count all 16 over two? Obviously it's
not going to be eight times that amount. Could your office work on that number for us?
We could take a look at it. Thank you.
Mr. Secretary, we continue to receive complaints on the licensing side, that's one of the biggest
constituent issues that I have in my district and I know many others have had over the years.
Could you just kind of update us on some of the things there to y'all track how many people
apply on the professional side and just licenses in general, how many are applying on a daily
basis and how long it's taken to fill those licenses and kind of a progress report on how
all that goes because it just seems to continue to be an issue that we have and also have ethics
meeting tomorrow at four o'clock. I'd love to see you there as well, so I appreciate your response.
I guess from a standpoint of productivity, we've gone from 900 applications per employee to
1,250, which is a 28 percent increase in efficiency. We also have up 67 percent more applications
since 2018, with no increase in manpower.
With the new software we've taken, as I just used,
the nursing example, but I could pull up some other boards
and send those over to you, but nursing gone from
48 days down to 18 days.
But we now have a new online portal that went into place
as an additional further enhancement.
We'll continue looking at how to enhance this
improved customer service.
But people have now 24-7 availability of looking exactly where they are through that process.
Instead of having to call a number, email, they can just go online and see where they are in that process.
And that has just reduced the number of calls we had and we've had thousands of people
avail themselves of that service.
So we'll continue to look at how to improve that.
We have a strong team and they're dedicated to making further improvements in the process.
But we're really impressed that we've increased our efficiency 28% and we've also
have 60% more applications, which shows that Georgia is growing.
It's open for business.
And we want to make sure it continues to be a great place to start your business.
Raise your family.
Thank you.
Chairman Carpenter.
Thank you.
Is Liz here today?
No.
Hey.
I'll just make this here.
First of all, I want to thank you for all you do.
I know I'm a pain in your side sometimes.
I appreciate your help.
Two things.
First thing, do you guys have any kind of legislative suggestions
on how to streamline the licensing process
or there are certain boards that need some attention
to make sure that we're continuing to get these things turned
out so Georgians can get to work, especially folks
that move into our state that are qualified?
And the second question is, could you guys put out some figures
on how many volunteers and the cost to Georgia taxpayers
if we went to paper ballots hand counted?
Because I think there's, you know, I understand that the people
has desires, but I think that he'd understand the magnitude
of the dollar and the magnitude of volunteers
it would be required to do such.
So, well as to release the hand counting we could just really
extrapolately where this is done in certain counties like an Arizona they did
this in other places and give you an idea what it would look like with four
million people voting during a gubernatorial year, five million people voting
during a presidential year. So we can get that to you. Then your first question?
What boards can we do to certain boards that you see they're lagging on? You know
whether it's they've got a 500 person quota for meetings for that month or what
What can we do as a legislature to hold them to the fire so we can get people to work quickly as possible?
And the reason being, is if somebody on a border community, people that have communities that surround other states,
we get a lot of people that move into our community to work and then they get held up.
That's the reason.
Well Chairman, it's a great question.
This office, just our office, license over 240 different licenses and over 40 different
boards.
I think structural engineers should be licensed, I am one, and that's public safety.
I think nurses should be licensed, that's public health.
We get it.
But sometimes you question some of this stuff.
In fact, when we were in the General Assembly, there was one for lactation consultants.
I voted against that bill.
Then I become Secretary of State, and as Secretary of State, I have to defend that bill.
Notably, they never asked me for a deposition, and finally, as it wound its way through the court, it was struck down.
And so we really need to be mindful of what really needs to be licensed and what does it need to be licensed.
So we could ask about other professions.
Does it need to be licensed to be a barber?
And if it does, does it need to be re-licensed, you know, in that fee cost every year or every two years,
or could we look at extending it out?
What has really changed in that industry?
Obviously, electricians and plumbers technology changes,
but do we have to re-license that every two years?
What could we do to stretch that out
to make it more in line with any technology changes
that you could have?
But we probably need to do a deep dive in that.
I do think we license too much.
And whenever I have an opportunity to license things,
I don't think need to be licensed
or people have been doing it since the beginning of time.
It doesn't need to be licensed.
And so I support, I think what you're leaning
is towards that we don't, we want to make sure
it's a friendly place to build a business
and not over regulate people.
We need to cut rate tape wherever we can.
Because government doesn't create jobs.
If anything that can do is get them
way of creating a good paying job
with entrepreneurs such as yourself.
Thank you.
Senator James.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Hello, I'm Mr. Secretary of State.
I, two of my questions have already been answered
while I was waiting to be called on.
But it's one that you might think is petty,
but I want to know, why is it that if we want to give
outstanding Georgia citizen awards to people in our district,
we have to go to 10 or 15 for the whole year.
And also with the, what is it?
Honorary Georgia citizens for diplomats who might come here.
So why is it that, I mean, do you, we need to pay something?
Because clearly, the paper couldn't cost that much.
I just need to know that question.
But if you answer the one about the elections
and how many licenses do you give from the Secretary of State?
You've just answered that.
Thank you.
That goes back to long-standing policy.
And I don't know when that began.
It may go back to Ben Forteson days.
But when we had the office, but there was a limitation.
It's really based also in our office.
We only have so many folks.
If you look at there's over 220 members.
And so it's just really something
to be manageable for the amount of staff that we have but obviously if you have additional
folks we'll take a look at it but we just wanted to make sure that you know we had some
reasonable boundaries on it but obviously we want to be respectful of our senators and
representatives and if we need to expand that further we'll take gladly take a look
at that for you.
I hope you will look at it because if someone dies in my community and I've already
I use 15, what am I going to tell them?
Oh, wait to next year and that won't work.
So I don't understand why.
That many people don't use those.
But I live in the metropolitan area.
And I, for some reason, people think
that that's the greatest honor that a Georgian can get,
even post-humans leave, if they are there.
Well, thank you.
And we'll look at it.
And I'll get back to you.
Representative Liam.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
New topic, security, so I'm a security attorney myself and I know that states play a really
robust, can play a really robust role in preventing fraud, particularly for seniors.
I know that's been a cause for you.
I also commend you for your agency op-ed after First Liberty, promising to essentially put
more towards securities investigations, the securities division, I'm not seeing that
in this budget, and so I wanted an explanation for that, it's possible.
Primarily we had a bill called Senate Bill 284 that did not pass on the 40th day last
year, and we'd highly encourage to pass that one forward.
And then additional strengthening of the law, that came out before the whole first Liberty
situation developed. But it gives protections to investors. Our recommendations that we
are presenting are really the governor's recommendations. We were aligned on that.
We always could use additional resources, but for the resources we have, we have a robust
team. And our securities team is recognized as one of the tops in the entire country.
And so we work very diligently. Our people are diligent. They want to make sure they
They stamp out frauds, Ponzi's schemes, and other illegal securities violations, and
we'll continue to do that with the team we have.
But it does take resources.
It will take the will of the General Assembly to add additional funding to add additional
investigators.
Chairman Anderson.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Secretary, thank you for being here today.
Quick question, just to follow up on some of my Senate colleagues' questions earlier regarding
the funding request for elections.
The amended request asked for 1.8 million
for the OCR count, and then the 5 million
for the full hand count for the two top tier elections.
Is that for primary or is that for the general next year?
That's for the general.
For the general.
OK.
All right, thank you.
I can't tell.
Thank you.
Thank you, Chairman.
Secretary, I wanted to ask a question around security as far as home ownership.
For foreign investors into the state of Georgia who buy homes, is there a possibility where
they can be treated like a business where they have to come and file an annual report just
so that we know who owns what when they're outside
of the country and where they own property.
I know they're not supposed to buy within certain areas
of more secure areas such as based, you know,
our army or military bases.
But what about in communities so that we can see
at a municipal level who owns what.
And sometimes we've just, we've got bad actors
and we don't know who owns.
and we can't really get the other to comply with local ordinances.
Is there a possibility or does that make sense?
I know that there's a concern which I share about foreign ownership of our farmland,
but you're also raising another issue and I'll have to review that
and I'll get back to the committee and the members.
Thank you. Thank you for your question.
Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I think you can see there are a lot of questions. You've answered all of them and I hope that you will continue the
interest and
Directed toward the licensing division because we we did have a lot of focus on them over last
Two summers ago and things have improved but as you can see they're not perfect
They're not there and I hope you will continue to focus some attention in that area. Yes, sir
But also when we do get complaints we do respond to them
In fact, we had a person
They were inspected. It was a barber and so we now are providing the member, you know the photos of our inspection
So you can look out why that person did not
Meet the acceptable level of standards that are required per state law
We will continue to provide great public service and to make sure that our members and the chairman are kept in the loop on these things.
I may have some legislation headed your way for more pictures. Thank you.
Thank you.
Next up is Commissioner John King with the Office of Insurance and Pire Safety.
All right, Commissioner, good, gotcha, you're about to hear me.
Okay.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Good afternoon, Chairman Hatchett and Chairman Tilly.
Thank you and members of the committee.
Thank you so much for allowing us to come and do our budget presentation.
But I want to start off with this is my only opportunity to really come and brag a little
bit about our agency in front of the legislature, and so I want to highlight some of the achievements
that you all have had a hand in helping us achieve, and so I'm very grateful for that.
First of all, this is a tough week for our agency.
We lost Steve Manders, our Deputy Commissioner of Insurance, almost a 40-year veteran of
this agency serving the state of Georgia.
So, you know, it's been a tough week for the team,
but it's an incredible, incredible individual
that was passionate about serving Georgia,
and we hope to continue his legacy
in providing absolutely a top notch service
to the state of Georgia.
Commissioner, thank you for bringing that up.
If you don't mind, we're gonna ask the committee
to hold a moment of silence in his members as well,
and the services state.
Thank you so much, thank you all for this opportunity and to highlight what our agency
has done to serve the people of Georgia every day.
The support of this body has been essential in the tremendous growth of this agency in
recent years.
Today, we are more effective, more responsive, and more transparent than ever before.
And we could not have done that without the trust and confidence that you all have placed
on us.
I want to begin by showcasing some of the success of our agency that you all have entrusted
us.
My agency is the second largest generator or wealth for the state behind the Department
of Revenue.
Our premium tax division is tasked with collecting taxes on insurance products and purchases in
Georgia.
In fiscal year 2025, we collected $1.71 billion in premium tax revenue.
$773 million of that was distributed to every city and county across Georgia.
With $737 million collected, it went to the state coffers.
Our criminal investigations division is responsible for investigating insurance fraud and related
crimes.
Behind tax evasion, insurance fraud is the second most costly white collar crime in America.
This cost of insurance fraud has passed directly to the consumer, and the costing the average
Georgia family between $400 and $700 increase annual premiums, according to the FBI.
But the stark reality is Georgia is still too high.
We are ranked number three in the nation for insurance fraud per capita.
We have a heavily invested in our division with your support.
We originally started with nine investigators in our office, and now we're not took office
in 2019.
Now we have more than 30 investigators, examiners, administrative staff, administrative staff
with enhanced capabilities that supports every community and we support all of the state
investigative agencies.
While we have grown in our capacity to identify and arrest those committing insurance fraud,
The conviction rate for these types of crimes continues to dwindle.
In order to decrease the amount of fraud happening in our state, we need prosecutors who are
able and willing to go after-
You
While Georgia being the number one state to do business, our state has been flooded
with new construction.
And anytime there's a new construction like a new wing of a hospital, additional renovations
to a church, or a new stadium, or public facility, our team is there to ensure that the safety
of those occupants.
With the reopening of the Rivian plant, for example, our office is taking steps to have
personnel there at all times to ensure that the production can ramp up to full speed
as soon as possible, and ensure to continue investment in our great state.
We're continuing to actively recruit, train, and retain boiler, elevator, amusement,
to manufacture housing inspectors who are a critical part of the safety and occupation
of our state. When I first took office, we only had 40% of the elevator inspections
were completed across the state. This year, we are projected to reach higher than 90% completion
rate. And the only reason I don't have 100% is because we're building elevators almost
every day. It is just an ongoing battle. But thanks to you all support, we've been
and able to put a serious dent in this challenge.
Last year, this body provided us with the funding
for 45 additional positions in the Safety Fire Division,
which was critical to this achievement,
paving the way for a stronger and safer Georgia.
Next slide.
I don't know if you all know,
but there's gonna be an event later on this year
called the World Cup.
Well, apparently, our agency is very involved
in the safety and inspections,
of all the, you know, all the facilities and the places where a lot of our international
guests would be coming.
And so, there will be eight matches in our great state during June and July.
We're working closely with FIFA, with the World Congress Center, the city of Atlanta,
and preparing well in advance for this truly massive event.
We are, we're hosting the, just like we hosted the Olympics in 1996, nearly 2 million spectators
participating, participated and traveled to Atlanta and to our state. Recently, FIFA has
seen millions of visitors from across the globe to travel to these matches. Currently
projections estimate that between five and six million people will be traveled to the United
States to watch these matches and participate in fan events. As a result, our team has
been in all hands on deck and will make sure that we are prepared to host these visitors
in a safe environment. In support of this responsibility, the office will enforce all applicable
state or Georgia life safety codes along with other relevant state approved fire building
and safety codes and standards. This includes comprehensive plan reviews, permitting and
onsite inspection of activities to verify compliance with requirements over occupant,
safety, fire protection systems, means of safe egress, and crowd management.
Emergency preparedness and active crowd of facility monitoring during these events.
Our law enforcement officers in the office will provide support to the inspection operations
and regulatory enforcement and active crowd monitoring through these events.
Their presence will enhance situation awareness, support compliance efforts, and contribute
in maintaining a safe environment for all participants.
Additionally, the office will conduct inspections and regulatory oversight of all escalators, elevators,
and any conveyance system within stadiums, fan zones, and support facilities.
This includes ensuring that these systems are properly certified, maintained, and operated
in accordance with Georgia law and applicable safety standards.
Next slide, please.
Georgia Reinsurance Program provides the financial support for the health of insurers, helping
and cover the costs of enrollees with high medical expenses without passing the burden
onto consumers in the form of higher premiums.
The goal of re-insurance is to reduce consumer premiums, increase the affordability of health
care, and make Georgia an attractive market for health carriers.
As you can see in this play, since 2018, the number of health insurance carriers in
Georgia has more than doubled.
We now have 10 health insurance companies competing across our state, giving Georgia's
more control over the health care than ever before, and allowing the free market principles
to drive the cost for the average Georgia.
The average premiums decrease by 12.4 percent, and in some of our rural areas, we've seen
drops up to 30 percent decrease in premium savings.
to Georgia Access. Last year, Georgia Access launched a state official health insurance
marketplace. I'm glad to report that our platform has outperformed nearly every other exchange
across the nation and including the federal government. The first of its kind, Georgia
Access partners directly with enhanced direct enrollment entities to sign up consumers
for health coverage. The EDEs are web brokers that offer enrollment in all available plans
across insurance companies, an insurance company that offers enrollment in their own plans.
This year, over 1.3 million George signed up for health insurance coverage.
Over 191,000 of these consumers did not previously have health insurance coverage in the exchange.
And during open enrollment, our call center answered over 433,000 calls for assistance.
average over 5,000 calls every day helping people get coverage.
Seventy percent of those consumers utilize the enhanced
direct control.
And this is something that I really want to brag on our agents
selling health insurance coverage.
Eighty percent of those who received assistance were assisted by
Georgia licensed insurance agent across the state of Georgia.
Georgia. And so that's really the key. We let agents do what they do best, sell insurance
instead of the government trying to do it for them. So in every, in the year when consumers
saw a lot of change in healthcare landscape, I'm proud that our team and our state is helping
consumers each step of the way and enroll for coverage. As you can imagine, this is a
very complex year. We're still reeling from some of the, from some of the failures in
Washington DC. And unfortunately, as state leaders, we end up having to pick up and clean
up the mess, as usual. Now, the easy part, Chairman, now that I'd like to discuss our
agency's budget request before opening up to any questions you all may have. First,
I am not requesting any additional changes to the amended fiscal year 2026. I know every
The Constitution officer comes here and asks you for more money, I'm not asking for money and just continue giving me the flexibility to use the budget that you've given me and be able to provide those priorities.
For amended fiscal year 2026, we only have two major items to report.
First, we're giving back the state funds in two programs, nearly 2.6 million for administration and 582,000 for enforcement.
total return to over $3 million. This return, it'll state funds as a result of our
increased other funds that you will see in insurance regulation program. We
also asked that you continue to support our re-insurance program because
that's the key to keeping these insurance rates flat or decreased across the
state of Georgia. We are asking for a continued support to re-insurance
program in the amount of $120 million. User fees continue to support the
re-insurance with 82 million going to this program, and it claims have increased from
prior years by about 43% of medical expenses have increased.
For fiscal year 2027 budget requests, we are asking for the same items, the removal of
the $3 million in state funds for administration and enforcement, for an increase in appointment
fees, and also the continued support to re-insurance program in the amount
of $146 million. You will notice a $25 million difference between these two years, that's
because 2026 claim your experience was slightly lower than expected. So we're able to return
that money back to the general fund. And so with that, I would like to open to any questions
that you all may have on this or any other topic. Thank you so much for the opportunity
to do it. Provide this information to you all.
Thank you, Commissioner King.
The first question is Senator Carpetcher.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Great to see you.
You know, we passed laws over here, and then we hand them
over to you.
Those of us who do insurance work for enforcement.
And so I just wanted to tell you how much we appreciate the
recent action that you took on the parity issue that we've
worked on for several years where there are people who are
or not following the laws that we passed.
So I appreciate that.
Have you got everything you need, staff-wise,
to continue that work?
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am Chairwoman, the challenge that we have
is that a lot of people don't understand the process
and it's a very methodical and careful process
because if we take a misstep,
I'll end up in Fulton County Court on appeals
that they will take even longer to get.
I see my role as the old Atlanta police officer
that I was when I first started in law enforcement.
I direct traffic, I direct commerce.
You all give me the tools.
When a company breaks the rules, we pull them over,
we issue my citation, we give them a corrective action,
and we get them back on the road.
Now if they don't pay attention to that,
the pain will increase.
And I appreciate the support that you all have given me
and their tools.
But these investigations take a minimum of 12 months
because we go through every line of insurance.
We go through all their emails.
We have actuarial, folks go through every one of these.
And it's not as quick as I would like it.
And my team will tell you, I'm one of the most impatient
persons that they have to work with.
Because I want results.
I want to be able to show the people of the state of Georgia
that the insurance commissioner's offices
that they're out on the ball.
And so I appreciate the opportunity.
And we will continue watching this carefully.
You all spoke very loudly.
You passed this bill unanimously.
And then not many bills get passed unanimously in this day.
But you all gave me a charge that is very clear.
Insurance companies got to follow the law,
or else we're going to increase the pain.
Thank you.
Representative Yerda.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Mr. Commissioner, for being here with us today.
Appreciate the job you do.
With recent funds being approved for planned reviewers
and other positions of dealing with construction
and laser inspection, as the agency seen in notable improvement
in inspection backlogs.
Absolutely.
It's significantly, when our first took over,
we were six or seven months behind.
And in this day and when time and materials
can crush any construction project going on,
we've now sped up, we're now in the matter of a week or two.
And we also offer the opportunity for major projects
that want to accelerate, that they can pay an expediting fee,
and we will ship that work to a contract.
And you all made the suggestion that I look at contracting
solutions instead of increasing the amount of staff.
So we look at contracting solutions
to be able to speed up the Fed.
So we're in great shape.
Now, we have to, when a project like Rivian
or something else comes up, obviously we have to search.
But I'm, both Chairman of this committee
are not going to allow me to increase the staff
to be able to deal with those contingencies.
I have to be respectful of the taxpayers money
that we can surge operations,
and then we look at the data and where we need to grow.
We have our inspectors now based across Georgia,
so they're not commuting from Atlanta.
And so we're close and we're using our computer solutions
to be able to manage, for example,
if you have an inspector down in the middle drill,
he will look at what other inspections are in that general area
and can hit him in using mapping and heat maps
be able to speed their amount of inspections.
And so I'm very proud of the team.
But we haven't grown.
You all gave me 45 additional positions last year.
Before I come to you all and ask you for more,
I want to make sure that we don't want to get too big
and then start wasting.
I'd rather keep a very close eye on how the throughput is.
But we're holding our own so.
Thank you.
Representative Lamb.
I just had a good to see you, Commissioner.
I don't know you.
Sorry, I can't see you back there.
I had a factual question.
The 14,000 insurance fraud complaints
that you mentioned earlier is quite staggering.
And I asked the Secretary of State
earlier about a fraud question.
So I'm obviously interested in this.
We're absolutely, can you speak up just a little?
I know you're self-spoken, but thank you.
Yes, thank you, Chairman.
So the 14,000 figure regarding insurance fraud,
one, is that across all types of insurance?
All lines of insurance, yes, sir.
Second is, who are these actors?
Do you have any idea who they are?
You name it.
It's the runs of gamut, it's not just,
a lot of it's sometimes as consumers,
it's sometimes organized criminal groups.
The stage, for example, accidents.
And people who are participating in this kind of fraud,
don't just do insurance fraud.
They do workers' comp fraud, they do insurance fraud,
they do banking fraud, romance scams.
These, I will assure you, GBI and your law enforcement agencies
have arrested all the dumb criminals.
We are now dealing with PhD level quality.
These are very complex tough cases.
And as you can imagine, the district,
We're presenting quality cases.
But the district attorney's offices are overwhelmed,
so they're having to choose do I prosecute a violent crime,
or do we prosecute an insurance fraud scheme
that is very complicated and is tough to explain to a jury.
That's what we, instead of just whining about a problem,
I wanna be able to go and help those district attorney's office
with additional resources with some of our attorneys
to help them prosecute it so we can make a dent on it.
We're number three in the nation, and I'm not satisfied.
Neither should you.
And thank you, that's why I'm asking these questions.
We just want to know more, obviously.
And so to that point, the third and last part of the question
is of those 14,000, how many have been successfully
prosecuted, landing in some sort of conviction
for the fraudulent actions?
It's quite disappointing, sir.
We're presenting cases across the state of Georgia
in many of them, the district attorney's office.
And the police do not take my comments
to just bashing the district attorney's office.
I used to be a chief of police.
I know that they don't have any good, easy solutions.
And it'd be easy for me to hear,
just come and wind at the district attorney
of this county, this county, it's not prosecuting.
That would not be a fair criticism.
My job is if I'm gonna present a problem,
I need to offer viable solutions.
And I have a great relationship
with district attorneys across the state.
I mean, I've been in law enforcement 31 years.
And so our rates is pretty low.
I mean, we're presenting cases
then they get non-prosecuted
or when they get prosecuted a lot of times,
you know, they give minimum sentences.
If we're gonna truly create a deterrent,
we got to make this type of criminal activity really sting.
And the victims of these crimes are usually our seniors.
Every time we have a major storm,
every storm that we've had, our agents deploy,
we work closely with the sheriff's,
police chiefs and district attorneys,
because the fraudsters follow these storms.
Every tornado, every wind storm we have, the fraud follows.
And so we're deploying now.
We're not waiting for the fraud to come to us.
We're going out there to try to stop it before it occurs.
And so we're number three, sir,
and I'm not going to make any excuses.
We got to do better at this.
And my log jam is getting prosecutions
at the district attorney's office.
I have two questions. One, when you talked about, well, first, let me back up and say thank you. Your office has been very reactive quickly in terms of getting information.
But I have a factual question about the slide for the reinsurance and the point about the reduction in premiums.
Yes.
I have so many constituents who are reaching out to me to say the exact opposite that they
are seeing skyrocketing premiums and it was my understanding that specifically for the
ACA premium increases, the average increase was well into the double digits, not a decrease.
So can you clarify this point and then-
Yes.
Yes, ma'am.
We're talking two different things.
The reinsurance pool covers-
If you look at the slide with 2008, it covers only re-insurance.
And if you look at the slide, 2018, the majority of counties only had one insurance carrier
participating in the market, which means that obviously the state benefit plan is the
carrier.
So part of the strings of that contract negotiation is you had to be in every county.
When we started implementing re-insurance, look at 2022 and now look at 2026.
Now we have the high risk where companies now want to go into these counties and compete.
And so, yeah, the subsidies is a whole different topic that I would ask you to maybe have a
conversation with your congressional delegation about.
Thank you for clarifying.
I just want to clarify, this stat is not health insurance, premiums decreasing.
is specific to re-insurance, and then the related question is on the next page, where
you talk about the dramatic increase in coverage on access, which was very positive, but can
you clarify the percentage of those that probably were impacted by the ACA tax credits and
what you might be doing to serve our constituents as we're getting these 20, 30, 40% rate increases
year after year. Great question. I hope I answered your question based on re-insurance.
And re-insurance is the ability of companies to go and compete across the state of Georgia.
When we only have one carrier competing in parts of Georgia, they set them in the hospital system,
set the rate. And you know, y'all giving me a lot of authority, but you haven't given me the
authority to set, you know, what rates, you know, what rates are applied or not. I don't have that
authority. I can accept them, I can slow them down, but ultimately, if the market is competitive,
you know, a lot of people think I'm the czar of insurance rates. And I guess my job is to be
the blame catcher for insurance rates. I get it. That's why I'm a constitution officer. But
I can't go to an insurance company, says, I don't like your rate. I'm not approving it.
What are the roadblocks that are in place? You?
you?
The roadblocks for the insurance companies?
Legislature.
They have never given the authority to the insurance commissioner to, and don't give
me wrong.
I don't want, I think it's dangerous for one individual to have complete control over
rates.
We can only go back to the history of insurance commissioners in Georgia and how many
of them have gone to prison that I would temper that.
But I have, don't give me wrong.
I have a lot of tools to be able to deal with that,
with that, and have an influence.
But please don't think that I'm the czar
of insurance rates, because you've never given me that.
I thought no insurance commissioners
had that authority.
Just want to make sure.
Can we go back to the other slide on that?
I think that is a good place to end.
Commissioner, you have answered all the questions.
We can sit down and talk to you.
I've answered all the questions.
Thank you.
The chair is just happy that I'm not asking for more money.
Thank you very much chairman and members of this committee appreciate the opportunity to present to you all thank you thank you commissioner King
Next up is commissioner Holmes with Department of Labor
20 years ago, I'll get 30% of the graces every year, and there's none of the shittles in public.
Yeah.
The same church company talked about this roof.
It's a great piece of this.
It's destroyed in our country.
And of the skies that they're helping.
You're absolutely right.
Huh?
All right, y'all, let's turn to roll it down.
Commissioner Holmes, thank you for being here and turn it over to you.
Well, thank you so much. Good afternoon.
Good afternoon to our honorable members of the Georgia General Assembly.
I'm Labour Commissioner Barber of your homes, and I'm joined today by my Chief of Staff,
Jansson Head, my Chief Financial Officer, Kate Ferman, and we truly are honored to be
here and grateful for the opportunity you provided us to discuss funding for the recommended
and the Governor's budget for the Georgia Department of Labor.
On behalf of our entire team, I do thank you for your partnership and for the state funding
that you have entrusted to our agency, because your support allows us to deliver mission
critical services to the Georgians who need them most.
That investment is powering the largest unemployment insurance modernization in state history.
Government should meet the urgency of the people it serves, and as a part of this agency
why transformation, we're replacing a system from the 1980s with technology that will help
Georgians faster, safeguard taxpayer dollars from fraud, and eliminate the technical bottlenecks
that have long impacted workers and employers alike.
Migration to this new system will begin toward the end of 2026, and to say that we're excited
about this would be a significant understatement.
This afternoon, I will walk you through our new strategic plan,
the governor's budget recommendations for amended fiscal year 2026,
in fiscal year 2027, and provide you an update on the agency
transformation and the unemployment insurance trust fund.
Let's start with the foundation of our work, our strategic plan.
Since taking office, I have met with workers, employers,
and community leaders across your districts,
and their message is clear.
A strong Georgia depends on a labor department
that moves at the speed of business
and delivers measurable results.
The Georgia Department of Labor is rising to meet that challenge
by evolving into an organization
that is forward-thinking, future-focused, and resilient.
And that is why we recently launched
our Comprehensive Strategic Plan,
the future of GDOL, a bold transformation.
This plan is built on four pillars,
customer-centric transformation,
and powering talent and leadership,
modernization and operational excellence,
and strategic influence and partnerships.
Together, these pillars align directly
with labor's budget priorities
and reinforce legislative initiatives
that expand opportunity, strengthen our workforce,
and fuel Georgia's continued economic rev.
To achieve the goals outlined in our strategic plan,
The governor's budget provides targeted funding
to support our employees and key initiatives,
totaling $3.26 million for amended fiscal year 2026.
Starting on page 250 of the governor's budget report,
there's a total increase of $1,563,078 to provide
a one-time salary supplement of $2,000
for our full-time regular employees throughout the agency.
The next item, which is line two under departmental administration, is an increase of $611,661 to cover
rent for the Athens and Thomasville Career Centers while we work with the State Properties
Commission to fill recently vacated space.
The Athens and Thomasville Career Centers operate under bonded leases, requiring that
Judeo remain until the bond obligations are fully satisfied.
These centers co-host location partners, so we split and share operating costs among
the partners.
But when a partner departs, GDOL's share of costs increases until the vacated space is
reoccupied.
That recommended funds will enable GDOL to manage these additional expenses while working
with the State Properties Commission to secure new partners to assume this space.
Line 3 under Departmental Administration recommends an increase of $1,090,000 to replace
aging laptops across the agency through the Georgia technology authorities and
user computer services. The agency's outdated inventory of laptops and
hardware is impeding our daily operations. Most of Labor's laptops were
purchased at the onset of the pandemic and have now surpassed the recommended
three to five year life cycle resulting in rising hardware failures and
increased downtime. This funding will allow GTA to replace and maintain laptops
ensuring they remain modern, reliable, and effective in the years to come.
Looking ahead, fiscal year 2027 recommendations build on these recent investments
and position the agency for stronger performance and accountability
with 3.4 million in funding.
The budget, however, first addresses statewide adjustments.
Starting with fiscal year 2027 on page 250 of the Governor's Budget Report,
budget report. There's a total reduction of $315,813 for statewide adjustments in fiscal
year 2027. These adjustments account for statewide changes in telecommunications and infrastructure
billings with the Georgia Technology Authority, Georgia at work billings, and a lower employer
contribution rate for the state health benefit plan within our administration and unemployment
insurance programs. Additionally, line four under Departmental Administration reflects
a reduction of $62,700 to remove one-time funds previously allocated in the FY2026 budget
for staff training, which was successfully implemented this fall.
Starting on page 251 of the Governor's budget report, the next recommendations provide
funding for critical positions needed to support unemployment insurance program activities.
2 recommends an increase of $1,642,557 to fund 20 additional positions dedicated to
the collection of unemployment insurance contributions.
We know that understaffing costs Georgia millions.
With only 36 collection agents, GDOL recovered just 11 percent of 288 million and delinquent
employer payments, leaving major regions such as Metro Atlanta underserved.
and so a strategic investment pays off.
Adding 20 collection agents at a cost of 1.6 million
is projected to generate 11.3 million
and recovered payments, penalties and interests.
And this would then be a direct infusion
into the state treasury.
So the math is clear.
Funding additional collection agents
delivers a strong return on investment,
its strengthens Georgia's fiscal health,
and it ensures it employers meet their obligations.
In alignment with the agency's strategic plan,
line three recommends funding of $1,059,178 to support 15 additional customer service
representatives who will assist judges with inquiries related to UI claims, appeals,
employer UI contributions and other critical services.
Let me give you a little data.
Our average call time is approximately five minutes and 28 seconds.
Our call abandonment rate is more than 30%.
And our current staffing is 27 employees of which 13 are time limited, and they are handling
upwards of 14,000 incoming calls every week.
The governor's recommended funding will enable GDOL to expand its permanent workforce, strengthening
overall call center management, and ensuring greater stability and responsiveness.
And in particular, the additional staff will provide critical support ahead of the UI
fire system launch, which is expected to temporarily increase call volumes as customers adapt to
the new platform. User training is incorporated into the implementation timeline. It's something
that's so important for success, but a short-term surge in calls is anticipated during this transition.
And these permanent positions will help manage that initial influx and enhance the long-term call
center operations. Reduce abandonment rates, improve service delivery, and ensure Georgia's
received reliable support well into the future. The need is urgent. The impact is statewide
and the solution in this case is staffing.
Lasting, line four recommends an increase of $1,100,583 to fund 12 additional financial
auditors dedicated to conducting detailed audits of employer UI contribution records.
Our auditors drive measurable impact through four key metrics. It's a percentage of contributory
employers audited, the percentage of total wages adjusted, the percentage of overall
wages audited, and the average worker misclassifications identified per audit.
And we know that when audit shortfalls weekends are enforcement, GDOL is below the federal
1% audit threshold, limiting our ability to detect fraud, identify misclassifications,
and recover funds.
These additional positions will allow us to meet the federal standard and strengthen oversight.
and auditors thus enhances compliance, it increases collections, and it safeguards the
integrity of Georgia's unemployment insurance system. This funding represents a commitment
to meeting federal requirements and a strategic investment in protecting state resources.
Now I'll turn to our capital items included in the FY 2027 governor's budget.
On page 390 under responsible and efficient government, line one includes 6.7 million
and capital funding to address the agency's most pressing facilities need, the demolition,
design, and construction of the downtown Atlanta Central Complex parking lot and warehouse
building. This building is saving, serving severe structural issues due to long-term
water damage. Despite waterproofing efforts in 2010, 2023 and 2024, damage persists due
to the building's complex design. Concrete corrosion has compromised the parking
deck that is used by Career Center customers and the underlying warehouse structures.
Water intrusion is now affecting the hallway between the warehouse and GDOL's data center,
raising urgent concerns.
Without intervention, continued water intrusion will further compromise the integrity of the
warehouse and data center spaces, as well as the parking deck that's connected to the
Atlanta Career Center.
Once underway, the work will take an estimated 18 months to complete, and our facility
team has developed a plan to mitigate disruption to the Atlanta Career Center operations during construction.
While these capital improvements are essential to preserving our physical infrastructure,
it is equally critical to ensure the financial foundation of Georgia's unemployment insurance system
remains strong. Georgia's unemployment insurance trust fund was depleted during the pandemic
in September 2020. As of December 2025, Georgia's unemployment insurance trust fund balance
starts at 1.98 billion, which is still 1.5 billion below the U.S. Department of Labor's
calculated solvency threshold of 3.48 billion. Multiple factors continue to impact solvency,
and GDOL remains committed to working closely with the governor's office and the Georgia General
assembly to develop responsive long-term solutions. These efforts will focus on strengthening
the trust fund's stability, ensuring its capacity to support Georgia's workforce, and
promoting a healthier unemployment insurance system for the future.
In addition to safeguarding the trust fund's long-term solvency, GDOL continues to strengthen
its fiscal stewardship through consistent revenue collections deposited with the state
Treasury. For fiscal year 2026, GDOL remitted $17,354,194 to the state
Treasury, which includes funds for administrative assessments, penalties and
interest. This amount represents an increase of $678,481 or 4% compared to the
same fiscal year 2025. The governor's recommended increase in audit and
collection staffing will further boost
risk return by driving higher revenue to the state
treasury.
I thank you for your time and for the opportunity
to be here with you today.
Your partnership and your leadership
are essential to keeping Georgia the number
at state for business and the best place to work and live.
And I will tell you, laboring is a team sport,
and we're in it.
We're in it with you, and we're proud to be there.
I look forward to continuing to work with you
throughout this legislative session
to deliver real results for the people of Georgia.
It is a new era for the Georgia Department of Labor
and we're proud to move forward with you.
So I'm happy to take any questions.
Thank you, Commissioner Chairman Workhazard.
Thank you, Chairman.
Commissioner, thank you so much for what you've done.
When you came in very quickly, you didn't just come in
and keep the agency rolling.
You came in with a very aggressive vision
that you're already implementing.
Couple of two things.
The experience of the Inspire system
just real shortly about the experience for the employer
and the employee with the new system.
Absolutely, so it's,
can I get the water?
Thank you.
So the UI system, really for us and for Georgians,
represents a once in the generation overhaul.
It's a platform built in the 1980s.
It was never designed for today's volume,
for its complexity, or the cybersecurity needs that we have.
So when we launch UI inspired at the end of the year,
our Georgians will experience faster, more intuitive
service.
The claims will be more efficient, reducing the delays
that have historically frustrated workers and our employers.
So for employers, excuse me, the system streamlines
reporting it reduces technical bottlenecks and improves accuracy and wage and contribution
data. And those are really big pieces. When I'm speaking to employers, we're talking
workforce, we're also talking the complexity and inefficiency of our system now. So both
our Georgia workers and our employers will see immediate benefits when this UI inspired
goes live in 2026.
Okay. Thank you very much. One other issue that gets brought up every single year, in our committee, is misclassification. Employees, employers, misusing employees is 1099 versus when they should be WT's reasons.
the enforcement part.
I think you mentioned that in your
come, come, come, come.
I think that would backfill almost every agencies.
Shortfall if we could tackle that problems
before the work on that issue.
Thank you, sir.
Chairman Lundsmith.
Thank you, Mike.
Daniel.
Thank you for a wonderful presentation.
I think you've got an active staff.
We have a fantastic team, and if you're standing,
but if you'll just wave anyway, fantastic,
then of course my CFO and my chief of staff
are up here with me.
Thank you, thank you for your presentation.
I'm still hearing from my constituents
who are victimized during the pandemic
when all the names were captured,
and they're still getting done in letters, threatening letters,
and such to say it.
So is there a number that you could give,
not publicly, but give to your legislators?
I'm going to try and reconnect some now that it appears to you I'll try to get on top of
the situation.
Absolutely.
We'll be happy to send out a communication to all members of the legislature with the
appropriate numbers that you can pass on to your constituents so that they can receive
the assistance that they need.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I represent Vance Smith.
You're the sorry.
You're the.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you for being here.
And we appreciate your presentation.
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Thank you for being here and we appreciate your presentation.
You did a great job. You know you touched on the unemployment insurance trust fund and
the problems with that and I know in the governor's recommendation to have additional financial
auditors. What are some other potential means to short that fund?
Absolutely. Thank you for that question. It is something that we should be asking ourselves.
Certainly we're asking that question as a Labor Department and you're asking
the members of the General Assembly and there are several strategies that could help
with George's UI Trust Fund and we're again engaging in conversations with members of the
Assembly as well as the Governor's Office. So I'll go through a few considerations and then
we'll continue to work with you. So one is to redirect the administrative assessment.
So that allowing the statutory authority to collect the administrative assessment from employers
to labs, that would redirect about $20 million annually from the straight treasury directly
to the UI trust fund.
So that's one option.
You could also establish a waiting week period and so 42 states right now require a one
week waiting period before claimants can receive benefits.
Georgia, however, issues two beats of benefits and the first payment.
And so if you institute that waiting week, it reduces the initial payment to one week.
It does create a cost saving equal to one week of benefits.
And what we know from our data is that the average claimant relies on UI benefits for eight
weeks.
They can receive up to 14 weeks, but they're waiting, they typically use eight weeks.
And so many will secure employment before that 21-day processing period.
So when you have the waiting week, you do create a savings.
You could appropriate state funds into the UI Trust Fund, some states, such as Texas,
have directed state funds into their UI Trust Fund to accelerate solvency.
And you could adjust the taxable wage base.
This is not what we're recommending, but it is one of the methods that you could consider.
So again, increasing the taxable wage base is used by other states.
It is not our recommendation.
However, just so that you do know, Georgia's current taxable wage base is $9,500 per employee.
And it's the lowest among the eight South Eastern states.
The lowest is Florida.
The highest is North Carolina at 32,600.
So it's something to be considered.
I'll also just note that maintaining one of the nation's lowest taxable wage bases
supports Georgia standing as a number one state for business and for talent and helps keep
us competitive.
So those are some options that could be explored.
Certainly we are open to exploring other avenues as well.
that I appreciate the question is a pressing matter
for our agency and certainly,
I know that it is for the legislature as well.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Commissioner Holmes.
Colleagues on first met her over the summer
and I must tell you, it's just a breath of fresh air
when you have a new person come in,
they put their arms around it,
they see what they need
and they actually have a plan of what to do.
So thank you, Commissioner.
my pleasure. Those who know me know that I like a plan, I like to work the plan and I will deliver
on the plan, so I appreciate that. Okay, well thank you so much for the opportunity and again it's
a team sport and we're delighted to be working with you. Next up is Commissioner Frank O'Connell,
the Department of Revenue.
You
You
All right, I've got the room transferred over here for the most important man that we're
involved with and that's the man that collects all the money.
time for us, this is last time presenting to us. I should know how many years you've been
here, Commissioner O'Connell, but I don't. But he likes to have meeting in his office. So
I guess this is the last time that we're going to get to be frank with Frank.
Yes sir, but I'll try to be frank today as well. You're always frank. Thank you, Commissioner.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and good afternoon, Chairman Hatchett, Chairman Tillery, and members
of the Appropriations Committee.
Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today on the governor's recommended
fiscal year 2026 and fiscal year 2027 budgets for the Department of Revenue.
My name is Franco Connell and I've had the privilege of serving as your state revenue commissioner since early 2023 and
Have a wonderful staff and we'd just like to introduce some of them. I'm joined today by Keisha Beaver's our chief financial officer
Austin Gibbons chief of staff
staff and an IIS Williams chief information officer and I'll add one of the
three finalists for Georgia CIO of the year. Joe Snowden director of
government affairs and communications. Now I'm also joined by another special guest
Mr. David Burge. Mr. Governor Cap announced Mr. Burge to be his next state
Revenue Commissioner following my confirmation for the George Attacks Court.
And coincidentally, David and I worked together right out of law school at a law firm called
Hansel and Post.
For both of our sakes, I won't disclose how many years ago that was that suffice it to
say that we have the same hair color today, and we have the same hair color that time in
the book that they used to produce every year of the young associates.
I was going to say that you're hair coloring, you know, you used the same dye.
Now back then, David worked in a different section than I did, but I found it to be very
smart and likable, very intelligent, and I'm confident that all of you will enjoy working
with David in his new role as State Revenue Commissioner.
Now before we go into the department's budget request, I'd like to provide you with some
general information and updates about the department.
This is our Unclaimed Property and Process Improvement Project.
Unclaimed Property, I have to admit before 30 years ago, I'd never heard of it, didn't know what it was.
Now I think a lot of people know what it is, particularly since a law was passed a couple years ago, and we have CDR's claimants designated representatives.
And that was an effort by you all, the legislature, to help unite people with their unclaimed funds.
It's been very successful and I could tell you that in fiscal 24 we reunited George's
citizens with $54 million out of the fund fiscal 25 that jumped to $115 million some more
than doubled.
And this year it's trending at over $200 million.
That's a lot of extra claims, fiscal 25.
We had over 79,000 claims processed and paid out.
We've had a lot of pressure on the team this year, and I probably had more inquiries
about unclean property, and in an attempt to deal with that increased volume.
Number one, we're getting a new system, and we're scoring an RFP that just went out
earlier this fiscal year.
So within the next time that the revenue commissioner appears in front of you,
we'll have a new system for unclean property.
But I decided not to wait until then because you can always make process improvements.
And so we have a two person team of special projects and they've been examining
what our folks do every day and they have found some ways that we can improve.
Did the team want to invite those folks in?
No, you never want to have somebody come in into your sandbox, but I told them they were
privileged because it was going to make their jobs easier, provide better customer service,
and they would be the first because every division is going to get the opportunity to have
a PIP.
Now we're also going to bring forward agency legislation this year to help improve our
uniting folks with their property.
The principal thing in that bill is called an exact match program.
We've got a lot of information about tax payers where they live so security numbers, et cetera.
We get information when holders submit funds to us that they can't unite with their former
customers.
And so we're going to ask for authority to match our income tax records up with our unclean
property records.
then folks without even making a claim can be reunited
with their property.
So we ask your favorable consideration of that.
I'd like to move on to Motor Vehicle.
We've made some meaningful improvements.
We've got a system called MyMVD.
And you can sign up for an account.
And in that account, you can do your renewal decals,
Several other things, one thing that resonated with local folks who are agents and staff
of the county offices was an ability to get a replacement title.
Folks you just have to come down to the county offices and present some documents and get
their replacement title.
But if you live at the same place, same owner, a lot of the information is the same.
We can do it online and get you your replacement title within a few days and you don't have
to go anywhere.
And I know that because I've used it myself for a title like couldn't quite locate but
I had a new one within about three or four days.
So we're proud of that.
Moving into alcohol and tobacco regulation.
few years ago we updated the alcohol regulations from A to Z. We're going to update all the
tobacco regulations and we're going to modernize the way that we distribute tax stamps and
that's how tobacco dealers pay their fees through the tobacco stamps. Up to now we've had
to have an inventory, manage the inventory, send out tobacco stamps.
And now we've issued an RFP, we've chosen a supplier and the supplier is going to take
care of the inventory and send out the stamps.
Now, the net for us, for the state, will generally be the same except it will free up one to
to folks whose sole purpose was to manage that program.
So we'll be able to redeploy those folks to better uses.
In tax operations, we've got our website, the Georgia Tax Center.
And one of my things to do has been to make that even more useful.
You can look at certain things in your account.
You can make payments.
But I know from being on our side, there's
a lot more information that we can look at than taxpayers could see.
So over the last three years, I've pushed to have some of the more useful information
pushed to that portal, and now we have a lot of tax credits, now tax payers can go online
and see the tax credits they have, what they've used, what they've got left, and importantly,
they can see what they've transferred because a number of our tax credits are transferable,
And they can see where they've pushed those tax credits and what the status of those is
also with net operating losses.
And we're going to continue to make that more useful and increase self-service options
for Georgia tax payers.
I'm modernizing the voluntary disclosure agreement process.
If you've not been following with us and you think you should have been, you can approach
us anonymously and if the information we get from you pans out, we can limit the look
back period to three years and waive penalties.
When I started that the department 22 and a half years ago, I think we had about 25 VDA
requests a year.
It's been a very manual paper intensive process, but right now we're in a process to make
it electronic, no paper, because we've gone to having perhaps a couple hundred VDA requests
a year, and that will serve taxpayers better.
Just yesterday, I know I didn't know what AI was three years ago.
We can't get away from it, so we have launched an AI-enabled tool into production.
It's called MSU Amazon Q for Connect, and it's going to provide real-time assistance
for our compliance division folks.
It's going to be able to pull from our FAQs, our regulations, our standard operating procedures.
It's been particularly helpful to our newer agents, because believe it or not, as somebody
He is on the phone asking the question, the system can listen to that question and already
know what materials to pull up for the agent and make it possible for them to answer the
question more quickly and accurately.
And of course we have safeguards in place.
We let people know ahead of time that we're using AI in rendering this assistance.
One thing I'd like to note, we have publications in the state tax world and they monitor the
50 states and I've been a little bit disappointed over the last couple of years but I found out
two weeks ago that they have put Georgia in the top 10 for tax administration so I just
want to announce that is part of our idea of making things easier and give even tax
peers what they want. It's been recognized by the National State Tax Press. Like to mention
a couple of DOR-wide projects, we moved and completed our move in February to 25 95
century Parkway. This consolidated us into a five-story building with a lower base
from an 18-story building. Just in fiscal 25, we realized budget savings of 1.6
million. So something that we're doing to be responsible with our budget. I can
No longer sit in my office and see Stone Mountain, I see trees, but taxpayers shouldn't have
to pay for my view, and I love trees.
So it's been a great move.
It's also given us a lot of good meeting space we didn't have before.
And so when we had big meetings of groups with maybe 80 or 100 folks, they had to be off
site.
Now we can do that internally.
we have two large meeting rooms on the first floor.
Our next big project that I'll talk about with transition us into talking about the budget.
And that project is the fourth round of surplus tax refunds proposed by the governor.
This $1.1 billion refund is included in our FY26 budget and will be supported by the
the legislature's passage of House Bill 1,000.
Now this is an all-hins on-deck effort for us at DOR
because we want it to be successful
as it has been the last several times
and make sure that our customers have a way to self-serve
and also that we're prepared to receive all the calls
that we will get.
Now I wanna move directly into our budget
and look at revenues AF26, AFY26, and FY27 budget items.
These are located in section 42 of the budget tracking sheets.
And I'll reference the fiscal year and specific line numbers
as I walk through this recommendation.
Now, beginning with amended fiscal year 26,
I'll start with our cortex and motor vehicle systems.
In section 42, line 42.6.2, the governor's tracking sheet includes 6.5 million for the driver
record and integrated vehicle enterprise system, also known as drives, and that's our motor
vehicle tag and title system.
Now in section 42, line 42.8.2, the recommendation includes 12.5 million for our integrated
tax system or ITS. These funds are to support a core 26 upgrade for both systems, ensuring
that they remain secure and reliable and compatible with modern technology. Typically, I think
vendors have a three-year cycle.
The last version we put into effect
was called version 12, and that was in 2022.
And it's time to upgrade to the newest version from our vendor.
It's going to modernize the underlying system architecture
and programming language.
We're going to go from something called vb.net to C Sharp.
It's going to strengthen our cybersecurity
protections for sensitive tax payer and driver data, it's been described to me, we have
of course a lot of sensitive tax payer data, it'll be in the vault, there'll be an encryption
level at which our systems operate on the data, if somebody breaches us and gets data, they're
going to get the encrypted data, which will be of no use to them.
So a very significant cybersecurity upgrade.
It'll also expand some of our online service tools
and improve our reporting and analytics capabilities,
also allowing taxpayers to complete more transactions online.
One last mention about Core 26, it'll improve our cloud infrastructure.
We were the first agency to the cloud, and I think the first DOR to the cloud in the
United States.
It gives you a lot of advantages, but having this upgrade will enable us to take advantage
of those ways to increase efficiency of server usage and storage.
Now, replacing either one of those two systems I mentioned because you want to look at alternatives,
that would be estimated to cost between $100 million and $300 million.
Obviously, this is the most cost-effective way to continue to manage our systems.
I asked my chief information officer because you always want to have something to compare
And of the 50 states, probably about 40, 42 have a system comparable to ours.
34 of them use the same vendor we do.
Would I like to see some more diversity, yes, but it says that this is a product
that works and that's been our experience.
As far as whether we should go to court 26, I asked them about that.
Half a dozen states, even though this is a fairly new upgrade, half a dozen states,
have already started, including when it's larger than us, Pennsylvania,
a neighbor, Alabama, so other states are recognizing this is a great thing to do
to continue being able to serve your customers and keep your data secure.
Now I'd like to turn to fiscal 27.
The governor's recommendation tracking sheets includes funding
to address also ongoing support and maintenance costs for these same systems.
In section 42, line 42.6.5, that recommendation includes $213,815 for drives.
And in section 42, line 42.8.5, $225,128 for ITS.
And these funds are to support the annual three and a half percent support maintenance increase under our vendor contract and ensure continued system stability and security.
Still within fiscal 27, section 42 line 3400.
The recommendation includes $102,546 to address increased postage costs associated with
the production and mailing of motor vehicle tags, decals, registration cards, and temporary
operating permits.
GCI Georgia Correctional Industries has served as our primary supplier of these materials
since 2015.
Each year they submit documentation requesting adjustments relating to postage and the
producer price index.
For fiscal year 27 funding reflected in this item addresses postage costs only.
Funding for a PPI adjustment is not provided.
The department would need to address that issue separately
through discussions with GCI.
Throughout our budget, you'll also see other adjustments
that are reflected in the budgets of other state agencies,
such as adjustments to billing for Georgia at work.
I would really like to highlight and offer my full support
for the $2,000 supplement for state employees
and the enhanced retirement benefit for post-certified law enforcement.
These raises provided by the Governor and the General Assembly
over the last several years have been well received by our employees
and have been extremely beneficial for retention of our workforce.
Likewise, the enhanced retirement benefits for our deal, our law enforcement,
will be another tool in our toolbox
as we recruit law enforcement to work in our law enforcement division.
That concludes my overview of the governor's recommendations
for the Department of Revenue and my final presentation
as your state revenue commissioner.
It's been an honor and a privilege to serve in that capacity.
And I want to say that I appreciate the governor's,
the committee's time and consideration on these requests,
support the governor's recommendation,
and we stand ready to answer any questions.
Thank you Commissioner, we appreciate your expertise,
your hard work, and the years you put in,
and the time that I've worked with you,
you've been nothing but I'm not gonna use the pun,
but honest and frank with me, thank you sir.
No joking, Chairman Burns.
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
Now Mr. Commissioner, I just want to add my thanks.
I appreciate you, your service, I appreciate your staff.
I appreciate the opportunity to work them on the Georgia 250 tag.
I appreciate Alex and Joe, and their support there.
So looking forward to the next chapter of your career,
but I certainly appreciate what you did for the park revenue.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Representative Denson, it's your turn.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you Mr. O'Connell and your team, they do a really great job,
especially Austin, I call them anytime, so I thank you.
But I have helped a few constituents with the unclamed properties.
Most of them that have had loved ones to pass away,
and they have to get death certificates and all of those items are sent over.
oftentimes they come back to me because apparently there must be more
documentation is required other than a death certificate when they're applying
for benefits on behalf of the family member that's passed away. Does anything
that you can tell me that I need to make sure constituents are aware of so as
they are working toward this endeavor they will be better prepared.
You know, of course it's more difficult if it's somebody else's property that you're
trying to claim.
Some of the cases that have come up to me have been a similar situation and the death certificate
would be one of the documents.
I'm not sure what other documents were requiring.
I know there was a document when I looked into some things and I'll just tell you what it
was it was a funeral bill that we wanted and we told our folks, you know, that's not
something that we need to have to identify the person who should get these benefits or
this property. So I'd be happy to work with you and let everybody know exactly what type
of documentation we require in that instance, you know, because it shouldn't be a mystery
and I'm sorry that your constituents
have had difficulty with that.
Mr. Chairman, Chokus.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Commissioner, I'm Mike Chokus from America, Georgia,
and I just want to give a great shout out
to one of your staff members, Jason Larkins.
I've called him at all hours of the day
and his responses have been immediate
and very, very satisfactory,
so I just wanted to give him a shout out.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Jason Larkins is, in fact,
the most popular person at the department.
He listens and he gets things done.
We appreciate it.
Reps in Washington.
Thank you.
Mr. Chairman, a commission I wanna join the chorus
of shout outs to your employees.
I believe you have Robert Whirl is at home, and he helped us a great day of one of my constituents
have a very difficult problem with the truck type, very complex, and I was sent to him
and he just responded beautifully and I got a wonderful take from my constituent, praising him for what he did.
So just wanted to come in on that, and also to thank you, you've always been kind
and help me any time I've ever asked you, you serve so well and I wish you the best in the future.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Thank you, sir.
Well, Commissioner, thank you.
You've been a statesman.
You have been truly just a steady hand and your advice was something we knew we could trust at all times.
I've enjoyed parsing out with holdings versus any other type of legal matter with you
and look forward to reading your decisions in the coming years.
Thank you for what you've done for our state.
Thank you for the steady hand that you've been.
And David, no big shoes here, buddy.
I mean, you just heard every single legislator praise him.
So, I mean, we look forward to seeing you
at the subcommittee hearings a couple of days.
But welcome, welcome as well,
and we know you'll do a great job.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And let me just say 14 years ago,
somebody at DOR asked me if I ever wanted to be commissioner,
Of course, I said no, that job was too big for me,
but these have been the three most rewarding years
of my career.
So thank you very much.
I'm sure.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Next up is Jim Potman, our retirement man.
Jim thank you for being here looks like it's cleared out pretty well if you'll go ahead
and get started stay on time thanks for being here this afternoon.
Thank you Mr. Chairman members of the committee I'm Jim Potsland I'm the executive director
of the Employees Retirement System of Georgia.
Just to kind of remind everybody of who we are, we're responsible for the administration
of state retirement plans for state employees, on the largest being, of course, the Employees
Retirement System itself, a number of other defined benefit plans as well.
In total, those defined benefit plans have approximately 120,000 active members, 79,000
retirees and we're approaching $25 billion in total assets and a statistic that I like
to share frequently is the economic impact for the state of Georgia which various studies
that I've seen have estimated a multiplier of about two to three times the amount that
we pay out in benefits which would put the Georgia economic impact in the neighborhood
of $3 to $4 billion per year so we're very proud of that over 90% of our retirees still
live in the state of Georgia. So I said the ERS plan itself makes up the
majority of that 58,000 active members which is notable because it's
up significantly from our low of just over 52,000 just a few years ago. The
recruiting retention initiatives that the state has undertaken in the
intervening years I believe are really bearing some fruit there. About 20
billion dollars in total assets and a funded ratio of just under 76% and I'll
have a lot more to say about that that figure in a few minutes. We also have
other responsibilities besides the Define Benefit pension plans including the
Peach State Reserves 401k and 457 plans. 97,000 total accounts about 44,000
members are G-CEPS members. That's the current tier of the ERS plan. So about
three-quarters of our active population are members of G-CEPS and they make up
a very large and growing proportion of the 401K plan at this point. The Georgia
Defined Contribution Plan is a savings plan for part-time and seasonal
members. Group-term life insurance is actually two plans that were closed in
In 2009, it still has a substantial number of members for whom we administer benefits.
We also serve as the state's Social Security Administrator.
Coordinated might be a better word.
As far as the governor's budget recommendations for amended 26, that begins on page 192
of the governor's budget report.
No change to our deferred compensation program.
That is largely almost entirely paid for by plan fees and forfitted employer contributions.
The Georgia Military Pension Fund and Public School Employees Retirement System both
are seeing decreases in their funding requirements from the previous year to the current year
in accordance with the plan valuations.
So we're bringing that money back to the state.
and the fourth one is not a change,
system administration itself,
we're not asking for any change,
but I did want to highlight that in FY 26,
$36.75 million was appropriated
an extraordinary basis outside of our actual
actuarial contribution requirements
to be paid to our eligible retirees
in the form of one-time payments,
and those payments were made this past December.
maximum payment was approximately $830.
For fiscal year 27, again in deferred compensation program, there's no change to the budget request.
The Georgia Military Fund again sees a decrease in its actual evaluation, actual contribution
requirements, about $76,000.
Public school system sees a decrease of about $5.4 million.
of that is due to the fact that previous years plan changes for which we had to do temporary
increases in the contribution requirements have now been rolled into the overall valuation
and so we don't need those extra contributions added anymore.
And again, in the system administration area, $26.75 million to be paid to be appropriated
to be paid in one-time payments to ERS retirees in FY27, this represents $10 million decrease.
So we're going back to the base level of 26.75 million, which we've had for several years now in the budget.
And I also want to highlight the governor's recommendation under the G-CEPS tier and the 401K plan for state law enforcement officers,
a budget item of about $5.2 million, which will support an enhanced 401K match.
You may recall a few years ago, we created an enhanced match for all state employees,
including law enforcement officers, which resulted in the possibility of an employer
match of up to 9% of pay. This enhanced newly enhanced match for state law enforcement
officers alone will improve that enhancement up to 15% of pay. So the remaining population
will stay at the level that we established a few years ago.
But I thought I would take a moment to kind of look back
over the past several years, kind of give you
a little bit of the history of the progress
that we've made, some of the steps that we've taken
to get to the point where we are at today.
This is a simple graph of our funded ratio
over the course of the last seven actuarial valuations.
Honestly, it doesn't look particularly impressive.
We've been pretty stable over that seven year period.
Funded ratio, which is the ratio of actuarial assets
to actuarial liabilities, is the most common kind
of simple metric that we use to look
at the relative funded status of the system.
But what I'm here to tell you is that just the Funded
Ratio by itself does not tell you the full story,
and I'm going to describe to you what is going on
kind of underneath the hood, so to speak,
to get us to where we're at today.
So, over the course of the last seven years or so, we made a number of changes to the
actual profile of the system, and these are all very significant changes.
Our assumed rate of return, that's the assumption of what we're going to receive in investment
return for every year into the future, was reduced from 7.3% to 7.0%.
with the idea that we're not, we're trying to become a little bit less dependent on
outsized investment returns going forward.
That also serves to reduce our discount rate, which means the present value of benefits
is a little bit higher today than it would have been using a higher discount rate.
These have the effect of increasing the liabilities of the system.
Our amortization period for any unfunded liabilities has been reduced from 25 years down to 20 years,
a little bit more aggressive about paying back any unfunded liabilities during a shorter
period of time.
The state has made the commitment to increase the required annual contribution in order
to support that.
Mortality improvements, so every five years we do an experience study where we look at
the assumptions we make in the actual process and we evaluate them against what has actually
happened over the prior five years and if we seem to be off track in any of those assumptions
we make adjustments for the following five years.
Previous two experienced studies that I've conducted,
both included significant changes to our mortality tables.
People were living longer, we weren't recognizing that
as quickly as we needed to be, so we had to improve,
basically extend the lifespan assumptions
in the actual evaluations, again,
we're adding expense to the system.
The police report that the 2025 one,
which we just completed,
has virtually no change in the reliability overall.
So we are doing a much better job
of anticipating what those liabilities
are going to be going forward.
And finally, and perhaps most significantly,
we began pre-funding a COLA for the first time
in our history back in 2022.
So far, we're able to support an average COLA 1.05% going
forward.
That's the amount of funding that we are receiving.
That's a number that we do expect to change over time.
And I'll talk about coal as a little bit in a second.
So that's on the actuarial side.
Added a bunch of expense, stated Georgia, then went ahead,
and continued its record of meeting its actuarial
funding obligations when expenses arise.
So what did we do?
Well, perhaps it goes without saying,
but I'd never take it for granted.
We received 100% of our actuarial contribution
requirements every single year.
A lot of states can't say that.
So thank you for that and for your commitment to meeting
obligation to our pensioners and our retirees.
In addition, the pre-funding of ACOLA
required a substantial increase in the funding requirements.
It was almost 5% of pay, about $150 million per year,
indefinitely into the future.
That was met.
We received, and once again, thank you
for this $200, $500 million cash infusions
in the last two years,
that billion dollars was put into the system
in order to improve the funded ratio of the system
and get us on a path to back to that 100% funded ratio
that we've been looking forward to.
And finally, as I've mentioned,
we've received now four, if I can count FY27,
we could receive four separate appropriations annually
for contributions totaling $117 million
to be passed through to our retirees
in the form of one-time checks.
So this will be the fourth year in a row
that we are able to provide those.
And we've also had, so to speak,
the wind in our backs a little bit.
The investment environment over the course
of the seven-year period has generally been quite good.
The numbers here mask some volatility.
Obviously there's the one outlier FY22.
But other than that, even within the years
some volatility there that doesn't really show up in these numbers. But what we're booking
in terms of final results for each year has been very strong, particularly in four out
of the last five years. A seven-year average of 9.6 percent suggests that our assumption
of 7.0 percent is well within reason. This is where I make my obligatory caution statement
where I say, look, it's great that we have these. I'd much rather book them and be prepared
for possible regression or downturn than the other way around where we've already had
the downturn and we're kind of hoping for a turnaround. So I'm happy with where we are.
I don't assume that we're going to continue to get 9.6% per year going forward, but it
is something that does help us when we are trying to make decisions and meet our obligations.
So far in FY26, when I created this slide a couple days ago, 10% was the number today.
It's 8.5, so a little bit of that volatility that I was talking about, but still a strong
start to fiscal year 26.
Okay, so back to the last seven years which I already showed you.
This is what the next five years looks like projected when I add it to those last seven
years.
The circle, the spot is where we are today.
I guess I should caution this is not a prediction
of what's going to happen.
It is a projection based on our current set
of actuarial assumptions and assuming that we hit them
right on every year.
Those projections will change each year,
but I will say this is the strongest set of projections
that I've ever seen in my time here.
So all of the stuff that we have done up to this point,
all those changes to the actuarial assumptions,
to the funding and all of that,
has put us on what I would suggest to you is a very,
very positive trajectory,
which could have us meeting our 100% ultimate funding goal
much earlier than I thought, even four or five years ago.
Director Pum, what point during the year
do you compare that ratio?
What day do you use?
These are the June 30.
These are the actual evaluation numbers.
So do you have the number for June 30th of 25?
I do not.
That will be our next valuation, which will be a-
How long does it take?
To get it?
It will be in April.
However, you've shared a number with us.
Are you going to share that number with the rest of the committee?
Hi, I'm going to share that number.
Thank you.
I do have some projections from the actuaries on this.
And that number is actually hidden in this chart here.
We're going to continue to see.
So we saw between FY23 and 24 an increase of about 3.9%.
That by itself was the single largest increase that we had
seen in at least 25 years.
Next year, we are projecting that we're
going to go from 76% to approximately 82% to 83%.
This is a significant milestone because a few years ago,
Chairman will recall that I had a conversation with him
where we wondered how long it would take us to get to 80%
sort of an intermediate goal.
And I at that time told him it would take approximately
three years.
and that was with the two, $500 million infusions.
And it turns out, it took him taking advantage
of the positive investment environment
and the money that we have received from you,
and we're gonna get there a year earlier than I thought.
So this is good news, just from this general standpoint
of being in a better funded position,
but it also helps us with the COLA formula.
The COLA formula depends in part on where we are
from a funding perspective.
We look at recent investment results,
We look at the funded status of the system as it crosses 70%, 80%, 90%, the COLA formula
gets more generous.
So hitting 80% this year will help us provide a little bit more substantial COLA this coming
year.
I don't have a final number on that, but we're looking at something, if it stays just between
us, something close to 2%.
is much more substantial than we've done up to this point. And just on the outlier years
here, we're looking at 100 percent potentially as early as 2030, if all goes according
to the projections. So back to Cole, it's just for a second. I've mentioned it several
times already. I just wanted to kind of consolidate everything that we've done into a single slide
just to give you an idea of the focus
that's been put onto this very, very important issues
for our retirees.
First of all, the formula that we used today
was established in 2022 in conjunction
with the $150 million per year commitment from the state.
Basically, they said here we have $150 million available.
What can you do with it?
We created the variable funding policy,
the variable funding formula.
I think it's important that we keep it
as a variable formula.
I think it's important that the system be able to react to events if funded goes up.
It should be more generous if funding goes down.
We should have a way to tap the brakes and kind of help the system recover.
If investments are good in recent years, we have the ability to do better.
Investments are poor.
You want to, again, tap the brakes.
So those kinds of things are important.
That's why it's a variable formula rather than a flat one.
$50 million funded and average, 1.05% COLA for indefinitely.
I will say that experience study that we just completed,
because our funded position today is better than it was in 2022.
The same formula actually can now be expected to produce
a 1.15% annual COLA incremental step without a doubt.
But at least it's a step in the right direction
and it positions us to take further steps, hopefully,
sooner or rather than later.
Again, the four annual contributions to fund one-time payments to coeligible retirees,
that's sort of the second leg of this process, and the third leg, again, is the $200 million
contributions to increase the fund address show, which hopefully would lead to sustained
level of higher coel payments.
Now, it's all on the defined benefit side.
As I said, we're currently, ERS currently is in tier 3 of its existence, what we call
the G-CEPS tier.
It was established in 1-1-2009 as a so-called hybrid plan, it's really just two plans, smaller
pension benefit than it used to be, and this 401k with a match.
The match, when implemented, provided a maximum match of 3% of pay.
We increased the default employee contribution rate, which was 1% at inception.
In 2014, we made it 5%, which led to significant improvement in savings rates.
Folks tend to stay where the defaults are, so we wanted to put them in a position where,
at least to start with, they were going to be able to receive the maximum match available
to them under the plan.
What they do from there was up to them.
Fortunately, many of them decided to stay at the level that we defaulted them in.
And then, as I said before, effective in July of 2022,
the 401K match was significantly enhanced
to be dependent not just on the amount of savings
that the person has, whether they save 1%, 5%, 10% of pay,
but also their service.
So anybody who has more than five years of service
can be eligible for an enhancement
to their 401K match as long as they continue
to save the 5% and that enhanced match
could be up to 9% of the pay.
And again, this structure is the model for the law enforcement 401K improvements in the
governor's budget recommendation, but in that case, it's a maximum match of 15%.
Just a few charts to sort of close this out and give you an idea of how we've been doing
what our experience has been.
Participation is just how many people are saving more than 0% right?
So in 2018, we're at about 88 and a half percent today and for the last really four years
so we've been hovering right around 95% very proud of that number that's
considered in the industry a good number. I do not take for granted the fact
that that means that 5% of our population is not saving. I'm not getting the
benefit of this match on any level to never mind the enhancement. So we do reach
out to them we do have annual kind of campaigns to try to get some of them to
save but there will always be a certain number of them that just for whatever
of a reason don't feel the need to do it.
Average contribution rate.
Again, this started climbing in 2014
when we changed the default rate.
By 2018, we were around 4.4% average member contribution
rate today.
It's more like 5.8%.
And it's still ticking upward.
We've probably hit a plateau, but it is still ticking upward
every year due to our education initiatives.
And then here's what happens when we enhanced the match in 2012-22.
When the maximum match was 3%, the average could not be more than 3%.
So you can see we were in the low to mid-2s in the years leading up to 2022.
Once we added it, the enhancement, it became a dollar for dollar up to 5%, and then the
enhancement above that.
So our average employer contribution to the 401k plan went from 2.3% to about 5.1%.
The average account balance, I don't have that table here, but the average account balance
increased from $8,500 to $30,300 just in that seven-year period.
So we're getting roughly 20% per year increases on average in our account balances.
So the total that is going into the accounts every year, whether it be employee contributions
or employer contributions, has increased from 6.7% to 10.9% during this period.
So 4% more per year with compounding, that's going to make a real difference in the outcomes
for many, many of our retirees.
So we're very proud of this.
Incidentally, I did pull some numbers at the last minute on the folks who are eligible
for the enhancement above 5%.
So it turns out that 37% of our GCEF's population is eligible for something higher than a 5%
somewhere between 6 and 9%.
Their average employee contribution is 6.5%.
So it's higher than the 5.8% population as a whole.
Their average employer contribution is just about 6% exactly.
So their total going into the plan is actually 12.5%.
So in the early years, it's already evident that that enhancement is beginning to work
as if we designed it and we should have longer term positive outcomes for that population.
And by the way, their average account balance is almost $60,000.
Part of that's due to the fact they've got longer service, but part of it is also due
to the early stages of the enhancement.
So I will stop there and I'll be happy to take any questions.
have one. Go ahead, Chairman. Director Jim great to have you here and enjoyed
working with you over the years. I particularly enjoyed working with you on that 9%
that we did years back and glad to see that it's actually working. I hate that
the governor is going to want up my bill by going to a higher percent but at least
he said he's using the same structure. He plays in the trail. This is I guess
question back on the the previous plan. I didn't see any chart this a little bit
morbid but eventually that plan is going to go to zero. The new plan? The old
plan. Yes that's correct. So it's going to trail off because everybody's the new
voyage on the plan and other people. Is there any you have any kind of a chart
that would show how that fun may eventually should keep dropping I guess
I don't have a lot on that specifically, and the reason is, that's a long way to be perfectly
honest. The number of retirees that are coming out of the new and old plan out of the total
population is still like 98, 99 percent. We have very few G-cept retirees yet, and so
about the tail on this. Well, let me put it to you this way. Remember the first tier,
the old plan, right? We closed that tier in 1982. There are still still seven state employees
who are old plan numbers. Okay. We'll be a while before we lose all of our new plan folks
as well. All right. Well, again, thanks for your work. And as we said before, if everyone
will do the 9% max that we're tires and big and airs, I hope they do that. That's right.
Just had a thought the other day when we were listening to GDOT talk about the private
public partnerships on peach pass lanes has, has there ever been any thought about doing
some of that type stuff with the state so we would actually be paying the return to
myself if that makes sense. I do understand. Honestly, our asset allocation for our systems
is very, I don't want to call it vanilla, but it's very, very simple compared to a lot
of other states. We're pretty much a stocks and bonds shop. About 60%, 65% in stocks
depending on in public equities, I should say, maybe 30%, maybe a little bit less in bonds.
We do have a small allocation to what we call alternative investments, but that's a
pretty limited in scope. We do private equity and not much else. So whether there's been
any serious thought, I can't say, but I don't think that there are any plans in the current
year to do anything quite like that.
That's all the questions. Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, members.
Next up is Director Branch with the Teachers Retirement System.
Thank you for being here today and for sure.
Thank you very much.
Good afternoon, Chairman Hatchett, Chairman Tillery members of the House and Senate
appropriations.
It's my pleasure to be with you this afternoon and take the opportunity to talk a little
bit about TRS as well as share our budget requests. To give a little background on TRS and
teacher retirement system we are governed by a 10 member board of trustees. Currently
we have nine trustees. Mr. Tom Norwood stepped away in December after 18 years of service
and we want to thank Mr. Norwood for his outstanding service to the state of Georgia and teacher
retirement system. There is a process currently underway by our Board of Trustees to fill that vacancy
and we feel like that's going well at this time. Currently we do have six educators on our Board of
Trustees, two active superintendents, two active teachers, a retired teacher and a retired principal,
along with, of course, several other outstanding leaders. I am coming on new as the executive
director after serving on the board for approximately eight years filling the big
shoes of Dr. Buster Evans who served the teacher retirement system for nearly a
decade and served on the board as well and so while I may be new in the
leadership position our team that you see here has over a hundred years of
experience with teacher's retirement system of Georgia so we're in very good
hands. A little overview of our system founded in 1943, operational since 1945, paying out
our first payment in March 7, 1945, $41.69. So benefits have come a long way over the
years, celebrating 80 years of service to our over 500,000 members. Currently we have
of about 155,000 retirees and over 242,000 active members.
Our plan design currently calls for years of credible service multiplied by 2% for each
year and then looks at the high average two years for the maximum benefit.
It takes 10 years to best in our system and retirement eligibility happens after 30 years
of service at any age and 10 years of service at the age of 60 you can retire with 25 years
of service with a penalty.
We do pre-fund cola through employee contributions that is paid out at 1.5% each year in January
in July, and as we are in IRS 401A administer plan, we do follow IRS guidelines as well
as state law that currently has an anti-spiking provision, wouldn't relate to salaries.
Currently, we are the 18th largest pension system in the nation, assets of the fiscal
year, 116.8 billion, 6.5 billion paid out in payroll around our state and country and
then an economic impact in our state of $9.3 billion.
We did send an email to all of our House and Senate members as well as give a hard copy
of our economic impact.
Hopefully you've received that if not it should be coming to you soon that reflects not
only the state economic impact but the economic impact in your particular area as well.
You see here some payroll information.
We do help for six various retirement options to our members.
The max plan continues to be the most popular option with about 60% of our individuals
choosing that but we do have several options and those are chosen at the individual level.
Stats as of July 2025, roughly 140,000 service
members, or service retirees rather,
receiving around $3,700 per month,
an average year of 25.5 years of service
at retirement, an average age of 60 at retirement,
and our retirees average around 72 years old
that are currently receiving benefits.
both of those numbers up slightly about two years ago.
It was at 59 for retirement.
And as you can see, we were 71 last year
in the fiscal year for our average payment.
We are pleased to see that over 99% of our retirees
are receiving electronic payment, which we believe
aids in helping us not have as much fraud
and keep their money safe.
We want to get that to 100% and we are continuing to work in that direction.
You see here now retirement trends over the last 20 years or so.
We average around 6,000 retirees per year, that's roughly 3% of our active members.
You can see that as of the close of 2025 calendar year, we had about 2200 retirees this year
so far.
on pace for us to continue to have around 6,000 retirees.
Of course, several of our retirees are interested
after a while, returning to work.
And so we have some return to work stats here for you.
Last year, we saw over 15,000 return to work
in a part-time capacity primarily.
Thus far this year, we've seen around 13,000.
We're pleased that we work with our employers,
and we can auto-approved those at a rate of over 80%
in under about 10 minutes,
making that good for our retirees returning to work
and also our employers that they're assisting.
Of course, since July 1st, 2022, House Bill 385
has allowed some of our retirees to return to work full time
and high needs areas to assist in our educational settings.
And you can see here that we've had roughly around 1700
and 50 or 60, so do that since July 1st, 2022.
This year we've had around 430.
Interestingly, House Bill 385 was recently audited.
And the numbers came back that our retirees that
are returning work on average have been retired
for and a half years when they do choose
to return back to work.
See here, our current contribution rates employee is at 6%
employers at 21.9%.
Of course, those funds then go into our investment pool
which helps pay for this lifelong benefit.
You see the asset allocations for our current investments,
equities at 74% fixed at 25% and alternatives at 1%.
You see the return on investment out
to the side positive equity market of 14.4% that really helped us with the 12.2% return
that you see there. Historically, over the last 50 years, we've had a annualized return
on our investment of over 9% and 14 out of the last 15 years positive investment returns.
market trends over the last three years we've had a combined 38.6 return on our
investment you see here that in FY 2024 14.5% that led the nation and once
again at 12.2% while we don't have the particular stats in front of us at
this time we are seeing that those are also going to be in the tops in the
nation as well. 80% of our assets are managed in-house at one of the lowest cost comparable
to plans nationally. You see next are funding ratio and employer contributions. Our employer
rate has remained stable over the last several years and we predict it to decline over the
next five as well as our funding ratio to increase over the next five years. You see,
we're currently at 77.9% headed to 79.7% and then as you can tell we're headed to close
to 90% as we reach 23. A few sustainability changes that our board has taken over the
last decade here designed to conservatively manage our fund adopted a 30-year emissation
schedule in 2014 looked at that again at 23 years and 2022 has been discussed
earlier by our counterparts in the ERS. We have also reduced the assume rate of
return from 7.5% to 7.25% in 2019 and then again to 6.9% in 2022. Recently
conducted an experience study to look at our retirees, their trends, the
salaries to make sure that we are making the proper assumptions and have had
good feedback on that as well. To get to the meat of while we're here today, our
budget requests are currently for $26,000. This is a $36,000 reduction from our
recent requests that is due to declining the numbers of teachers who qualify for this particular
benefit that's funded. This benefit is designed to provide retirees from local retirement systems,
a minimum allowance upon retirement. We currently have two individuals who remain under this plan,
both of those individuals are over the age of 90 and so we do respectfully request $26,000
in both the amended and the FY26.
Finally, giving you a lot of stats as it relates to TRS,
thought I'd give you a fun and encouraging one.
Over 11,000 of our retirees are over the age of 85.
That's roughly 7% of our retired members.
Take it one step further.
In fact, we have 89 of our beneficiaries
that are over the age of 100.
So I'd like to say that retired educators are not only the happiest people I know,
but perhaps the healthiest as well. So with that, I'd be happy to answer any questions that
individuals may have. Thank you, Commissioner. Representative Franklin.
How are you doing, sir?
I want to welcome you to your new position.
I know you do a great job, and I look forward to working with you.
Thank you.
The question I got.
Did you say there was a 1% invested in alternative investments?
Is that correct?
Yes, sir.
Do you see any appetite to increase that at all, or do you predict that's going to stay
at that level?
We have taken some measured steps into that since we've been allocated an opportunity to
do so.
I think we're capped at 5%.
so we're taking marginal steps within that,
but it has grown every year with the opportunity.
Okay, I think we increased it a little bit more
than that, but I was just curious to see if you're old.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Chairman Hips, Senator.
Yeah, I think it's 10% on the ERS and 5% still on the teachers.
Yes, sir.
So the ASS grew from 166 to 160 thing big, and I noticed
you had buster sitting back here.
You got a final friend available just in case.
And you had, I think it said 77.9% funded.
I know in the book, I thought I saw 85%.
So was the difference in that, the five years,
I guess you call it smoothing or wherever you don't show it all,
you kind of spread it out over five years.
We do smooth out our returns over a five-year period
to keep the volatility down.
So does the book have the non-smoothing
and this is the smoothing number?
Let me check on that for you and get back to you on that.
I don't have the book in front of me at this time, so I apologize.
Thanks.
We're from a commission with us.
That's it. All the questions, thank you.
Thank you.
Next up is I can't read it directly or I'll leave no
Commissioner Angelique McClendon, Director of Driver Service. How are you today?
I am wonderful. Welcome. I have Bob Griffin is here. He's our Deputy
Commissioner and he's a former CFO. All right. So we'll get started but first
good afternoon. I know we're late in the day but I do want to thank you for your
previous considerations over the past years but what we've done so far we've
improved retention you'll see that we've been able to serve customers at the
same level I would argue better over the past year at least we've expanded
services without expanding staff by doing things like adding a self-serve
kiosk things like that but overall volumes higher but wait times are
shorter processes are more efficient, technology is better and we're heading into our second
decade as DDS so I don't know, I mean if you might remember but House Bill 501 was passed
in 2005 and so it makes 20 years as the Department of Driver Services so at that point DNBS
was broken up to create the Department of Driver Services and as you know as you've heard
today motor vehicles is with revenue and so we have a new commissioner but the
same mission same core values. Short update on what we're doing again it's
20th year so the 20th year supposed to be your platinum year if you are
married that is your platinum year just don't forget that and some of you might
have passed that platinum year so you're supposed to get platinum on that
on the 20th year, so this year's our platinum service year.
So we believe we have delivered that platinum service
and we will continue to deliver that service.
But in 2025, our average wait time was six minutes
and 10 seconds.
And that was one minute and 16 seconds shorter
than the previous year.
And the average longest wait time was 15 minutes
and 35 seconds.
And that was three minutes shorter than the previous year.
Now, the previous commission of spend some more was awesome,
but these numbers are better, I would argue.
And we keep our focus on wait times,
but we will also want to focus on the quality
of the service as well.
And just add a glance, there are 9.1 million ballot drivers
in the state of Georgia, over 400,000 of those drivers
are commercial drivers.
And at the end of 2025, there were almost 600,000 digital
licensed users.
And how many people have, how many of you
have your digital license on your phone?
I see a smile.
That's not it, that's not it, that's not it.
It won't work.
Well, we'll get you squared away after this.
We'll get you squared away.
But we have surpassed, but now that was at the end of 2025,
that we have since surpassed 600,000 digital licensed youths.
So if you are a person who uses your phone to pay for things,
that's how you add that credential to your wallet.
And the same way you go to your sent your wallet
or your Samsung or your Google or your Apple,
whatever your platform is.
And you find a state because we're one,
we were one of the first, but we're one of many now.
You find your state, which is Georgia,
and you add that, and it will walk you through those steps.
And so we've made a lot of strides in that area as well.
And of course, we have 68 locations.
We have a new one that we, since we last were here,
we have Hazelhurst in South Georgia.
So we cut the ribbon and Hazelhurst not too long ago.
But that site, we've conducted many CDL tests,
commercial testing.
We've served about 2,300, a little over 2,300 customers since the end of September.
That's when we opened and our average wait time was in line with our standard wait time.
It was less than 30 minutes.
It was around six minutes.
In the site employees ate people down there in Hazelhurst, Georgia.
So that was a great addition.
And again, last year we had 11 commercial testing sites.
This year we have 12.
And so last year we served over 4 million customers,
4.1 total customers served.
And so that's great, that is a huge increase,
that's a 6% increase from the previous year,
but that more customers means more calls,
more mail, more transactions, more face-to-face interaction,
more remote transactions, more need for cybersecurity.
So the increase volume matters a whole lot
when it comes to our business.
And then 158,000 of those customers that were totally served,
were served on kiosk, the self-serve kiosk.
You have many of those throughout the state.
In grocery stores, those yellow machines,
we have our services in those machines.
And then we have self-serve kiosks in the locations
when you come in where you can,
many people like it because you can take your own picture
and you can do retakes if you like,
if you don't like those pictures.
So I've seen a lot of people who actually have the patients to do it.
I mean, you think some people come in and they might want to see a person, right?
But a lot of them love going to the kiosk, 158,000 of them have done that.
So that's great.
So as I travel around the state and go to each locations, I'm getting around to it.
I mean, 68, I haven't made all 68 quite yet.
I think I counted 28 so far since May since I've become commissioner.
So I've been counting since I've become commissioner.
I've been at DDS 10 years as General Counsel,
so I'm not counting though that time,
but since I've been commissioner,
traveled a lot throughout the state.
We have, again, 81 kiosks.
Our services are in 81 ITI, those yellow kiosks
in the grocery stores.
We have a total of 23 at locations.
And so we're in the process of adding some more
self-surf kiosks inside our locations.
And speaking of those types of services,
remote services, non-people-facing services,
we serve 1.1 million customers
that were served online and through the app as well.
But again, that leaves 2.9 million
that were served face to face.
And on peak days, which are Thursdays and Tuesdays,
we can see upwards of 16,000 or more customers.
So again, about 30% of our customers
to serve remotely and 70% are still served face-to-face.
So.
Commissioner, do you have any idea the number
of first-time license?
You know, I don't.
I don't know the number of first-time licensees.
I mean, that's an interesting number.
Yeah, that would be good.
Those are actually what we'll talk about throughout this
presentation are the predictables, right?
So we know who needs to renew.
We can kind of predict replacements maybe based on previous years, but we have been thinking
about other ways we can try to estimate things like who, how many people would be new drivers
and we would have to work with populations statistics to figure that out, but I do think
that's a great question.
Our budget is in three categories, Administration, License, Issue, and some regulatory compliance
So we'll start with the administration program.
We are very appreciative of the Governor
Kemp's salary supplement additions.
This will prove very, very helpful for retention and morale.
But we're requesting $114,109 to accommodate
the one-time salary supplements for employees
in this administration program.
And you see on the slide CDL Federal Mandate Notifications
From time to time, we have federal mandates that come
to our state that are related to commercial drivers.
And so to implement those, we have to have system changes.
We have to notify these drivers of those changes.
And we have listed on the slide three
that we had to implement within the past year.
And those involve multiple notices to drivers.
The coming changes sometimes, unfortunately, of revocations.
So that's unfortunate, but we do have to notify the drivers
that we're requesting $150,000 to accommodate
those implementations.
To continue with the license issuance program,
we're requesting over 1.7 million to accommodate
the one-time salary supplements
for the license issuance program.
This is our largest group.
So this is over 800 employees.
We're requesting this amount, the 101.3 million
for increased cart production.
That's that increased volume that we talked about.
As I mentioned earlier,
at least more transactions and more work overall.
You have more cars, more mail, more calls,
more interaction, more system changes
and things like that that are needing
when you have that extra volume.
And so we had to issue about 250,000 extra cards.
If you do the math from year to year,
our increase from the previous year,
that's around 250,000 as well.
And this is the prediction that's based
on expiration dates and actual cards that were issued.
And again, these are the predictables.
But as we just talked about, there are some other variables
that are unpredictable.
We talked about new drivers.
There's also new to Georgia, that's hard to predict,
and we've seen that increase.
There's also mail costs that we don't control,
necessarily, that are part of the variables
that impact our car production costs.
In the third bullet you see there is for armed guard services.
So our locations, again, we mentioned 68 different locations
that we have throughout the state.
They do not all have security or armed security.
We would love it if they did, but they don't.
We have the 12 post certified law enforcement on staff.
Course 12 is not enough to cover 68 locations,
but eight of them are assigned to locations.
They are primarily fraud investigations,
but they are post certified and state certified law enforcement.
But we do have armed guard services at five locations currently.
are requesting $150,000 to cover the cost for the armguard services.
And just to mention, when we just talked about physical security with armguard services,
another thing we're doing that has not required additional resources is that we're using one
of those post certified law enforcement officers on staff who has three decades of law enforcement
experience to do security assessments.
So he's traveling to each location, he's making security assessments and creating reports
so we can figure out what we can do to ensure the safety of our customers and our team members
without coming back here necessarily for certain requests.
But some requests we do make are based on the research that we've done from no security
assessments and we'll see that a little bit later in the presentation.
So continuing with the license issuance program, leases have increased.
So several locations, and nine to be exact, the lease amount has increased.
So we're requesting $139,000 to accommodate for those increases, for the leasing of those
facilities throughout the state.
And there are different parts of the state.
We are requesting $185,000 to continue compliance with GTA Security and infrastructure and that's
just penetration testing and compliance testing for our back end system.
So we want to concentrate on cybersecurity as well as physical security.
And then there's drives, cloud, migration, support, $428,000.
We are requesting for that and that is to support the drive system which we have a joint
project with, of course, as you can recall with Department of Revenue, but this is for
DDS system maintenance and mandatory upgrades that might come out of legislative changes.
Continuing with the license issuance program, we are requesting $2.4 million to support personal
services for decreased turnover. So our turnover has greatly increased and that's great.
We need retention, we need to retain team members
for their knowledge, their service,
and that's really how we can keep that good customer service
by people who are knowledgeable and are at that top level.
But to retain them costs, they receive promotions,
they receive standard increases
because they have been there for a certain time.
And so we're asking for $2.4 million to cover
the cost of decrease turnover.
In our smallest program is regulatory compliance and we are asking for $27,000 to accommodate the
one-time $2,000 salary supplement for the employees and the team members in our regulatory
compliance program.
So we'll move on to our bond request.
Our bond request consists of funds for support of facilities and upgrades for the facilities,
security safety and the next-gen project. So we need to replace time clocks and
ticketing equipment. That's one point. That's one million dollars. We are
requesting for that equipment. We are also requesting one million dollars for
facility safety and heartening initiatives. So that's the part of those
security assessments that we've been doing where we found that certain
materials are resistant to weapons and that they are helpful to secure the
counters and the other building material where our team members are during
work hours and then the CSE counter replacements we're replacing 430,000
dollars to replace older, worn, counter materials. And some of these counters
are over 20 years old. And for our FY27, a lot of these are the state required requests,
but then you also see in these requests you'll see the CDL Federal Mandate notifications
of course, this is year after year that we have the commercial driver federal mandates
that we have to comply with, and again, part of that compliance is to make system changes
and notify those customers of those changes.
The license issuance program for FY27, we have the same statewide requirements, the same
state requirements that are in this request, but then we also have some requested services
and for armguard services, lease increases as well and then the GTA security services and
infrastructure or in this budget request as well.
And also for the license issuance program, the personal services we just discussed due
to decrease turnover, obviously we are requesting $2.3 million for personal services due to
decreased turnover and also we have received funds for SAVE that is the non-citizen verification
system that we've been using in utilizing since around 2010.
So there are funds that are typically associated with SAVE and so from time to time there
might be some I guess federal wavers of those fees but then also at any point in time
those costs can be put back onto the agency and they also can increase as well.
So we are requesting the funds to make sure that we can maintain our personal services
and be able to utilize safe if we have to pay again for using safe.
The amended FY26 regulatory compliance program, statewide required additions, which these
are, the REC comp program requests are adjusted to reflect the benefit rates.
So these are benefit rates that we, this slide reflects that.
Do you have any questions other than the wonderful ones you've already asked?
Commissioner McLean, when did you become Commissioner?
May 1st.
I was wondering when you started out how everything had improved and I was like, look, Commissioner
Spencer Moore is not going to be happy.
Oh, yes.
I thought he did a pretty good job, but he took it even better.
He did an awesome job.
He did an awesome job and I calculated that's about May is about 70% of last year.
So I'll take credit for 70% of all of them.
You know he was from my hometown so we had a connection but welcome you did great things
are going look like the progress is continuing.
What is your turnover right now do you know?
The turnover rate out the 38%, 34% we'll go with 34%.
I hope it gets better and continues to get better.
Yeah, it is a must have been a lot worse.
If people are happy, so one of the reasons I try
to visit so many locations is to kind of
to see how people are doing and to see what their needs are
as they are facing the public every day.
So we can think we know what those are,
but it's good to hear it from them themselves
and actually observe what's going on, right?
So I can observe that maybe this location needs
another kiosk, you know, instead of waiting on the team to have the nerve to say that, right,
because they have to get it all the way up to headquarters here in Congress. So I rather go to
them and see how things are going and I feel like people in general are happy with what they do
and they take pride in what they do. I can tell that really from how they interact with the
general public that they really take pride in what they do. Yeah, because I don't have many
businesses that could run with a 34% turnover rate. So I hope it's I hope it
continues to improve. Right. Chairman Carver. I couldn't let this go away unless
Miss Leslie stands up because she puts up with me all the time. I bother that
poor lady. I must be the only person in the world that has license issues. Thank
you so much for all your help. And if you haven't used a kiosk I swear you're
They're in and out in like 30 seconds, so it's a great addition.
Great addition.
Right.
And our team members, and I will say that, is a testament to the front line team members
because they really had to buy into it and to be able to send the customers to the
kiosk.
And so it works just like self-check out.
So if you have something simple, go to the kiosk.
If you want to take five pictures of yourself, go to the kiosk because we're not going to
take five pictures of you at the counter.
And it takes six for me.
I think he probably broke the machine.
Senator Sims.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I just want to compliment the driver services
in America's Georgia.
I don't live there, but I didn't have my license.
I didn't have my tag on my car.
I was just, I was really going to jail, OK?
No, no.
But when I went in, I said nothing about being a legislator
and they were awesome.
I love it.
And I told them afterwards that I appreciated the help
that they provided me and how the customer service
was just great.
And I just want to give a shout out to those young folks
and that were working well in America's Georgia.
And it's part of my district.
No, thank you.
I love that.
And I would encourage you if you are visiting.
Now if it's an emergency, Ms. Leslie is wonderful, right?
But I would encourage you to do just that, to go in,
don't identify yourself as someone important
because they should be treating everyone
with the same level of customer service.
And that's really how we find out how the customer service
is if you're not famous to them.
And so I would encourage people to do that.
Again, unless it's an emergency.
Right.
Are you sure, Commissioner, you don't have pictures of these troubled lawmakers on the walls
up there and say, if they come in, we're going to check through it.
Well, I wrote America's down, so I might be taking the trip to America's, we'll see.
I'll report back.
So, Commissioner, I have the same thing.
We had, as you know, we have foster children, and what, one turn 16, we got as drivers license.
And that lady yelled at me to get off my cell phone just like I was any regular old person
in that building.
What's her name when you give her a raise?
She made sure that I knew that if I wanted to use the cell phone, I needed to leave.
But I say that and also say they were incredibly, incredibly competent, fair, they treated everyone
really the same.
Great.
But yes, ma'am, I know not to use my cell phone in your buildings anymore.
Now where was that?
Seriously, she did the right thing.
She did that.
That's my name.
But it was great.
Thank you.
It was not invited we don't have they did not have
A low is currently not a location in Videa you what there always could be but there is currently not one
There's one reveal. There's one in Reesville and how far far do you have to go 30 miles 30 miles?
Legislators understand that I mean 30 miles
They were incredibly confident and they truly they made that little 16 year old guy feel extremely awesome
I think it did a good job.
Thank you for that.
Thank you.
By the way.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Thank you.
Nothing wrong with having a little laugh.
I'll return.
Next up is director Ali with the Georgia Public Defenders
Council.
You
You
All right, welcome, Director Ali. Thank you. And the floor is yours. That is a tough
act to follow. I came in and I heard everyone laughing. I hope you're going to be laughing
about the public defenders, too.
Good afternoon or good evening.
My name is Amataya Ali, public defenders
for the state of Georgia.
And I'm joined.
And the reason why I say I hope you're
going to be laughing about the public defenders
is because when we tell you what we're doing
about transformation to put our clients back in the communities
because they're doing better, that's
what I hope you're going to be happy about.
not because they're going through the public defense system.
So let me correct myself.
I'm joined by Deandre Berry, who's our Deputy Director
and Terry Rayford, who's the CFO and Kenya,
who's hiding right there, who's the manager
for social services, who's the one in charge of making sure
that we have services that's putting our clients back
in our communities and transformed.
Just a little bit about myself,
I have been a public defender for more than 35 years,
a long time.
And in those 35 years, we have struggled
what are we going to do to make a difference?
Because wherever we are, we leave in those communities as well.
And I job is more than just representing people.
And over the years, I think we got it.
Today, as public defenders, we represent,
we rehabilitate, and we restore.
But it's been kind of difficult to get those things done
because we didn't have what it took.
But over the last few years, I just
want to say thank you to the representatives
who have worked very hard to make sure
that we have what we need, especially over the last summer.
I don't see Chairman Gillette here,
but I'm still going to do a shout out to him.
And all the members of the appropriation team
on both sides who worked on the common pay plan
for both the prosecutors and the public defenders.
That was a game changer.
And I will be remiss if I did not say thank you.
In all my years as a public defender,
I never thought I would see a day
when we will have public defenders being considered
so that we can actually deliver the job
that the taxpayers of access to do.
And our job is more than just being in the courtroom
When we leave the courtroom, we should always see to ourselves.
Then what?
The what is making sure that we close the revolving door.
And that's what you all did for us over the summer.
And Chairman Hatchet sent it to artillery.
And all the other members who are now here.
Thank you for spending that time during the summer.
Ms. Bogos, Ms. Smith, I see you all here.
We spent a lot of time during the summer
when the session was not even on,
to put a common pay plan together.
Somebody is probably saying what does that mean?
It means that we have a defined budget.
It means that finally, we can retain our employees.
Finally, we can provide better services to our clients.
And finally, it helps us to recruit
in even difficult to staff places
that we called, oh, Chairman Gillette is here.
I just mentioned your name right before you came in.
I was just talking about all your efforts
during the summer, and I just said thank you.
And I said, the common people that you work on,
I'm still saying thank you.
I said thank you in July.
I'm still saying thank you in January.
Thank you so much for all your efforts.
I'm grateful.
And because of all your efforts and efforts
of your colleagues.
We are able to recruit, even difficult to staff
circles places that we call the legal deserts.
We can stabilize our employee turnover
in the state, statutory attorneys right now.
We only have 6%.
It's never done before.
And I credit that to your efforts.
We can ensure that people who want to be public servants
can actually do it.
I remember when I first started as a public defender.
I did have family support, but if I didn't,
I didn't know that I can shop in the win-texies
and pigly wigglies of my neighborhood.
I didn't know that I even made enough money
to do that at that time.
And the most important thing we can do now,
we can raise the bar for effective
high quality representation.
We thank you.
And the parity that you have enabled us to get,
And I don't know if I'm representing Judge Gunter.
I think I see you.
Thank you so much.
HB 1391, I would forever be grateful for that.
It's unprecedented.
It's never happened everywhere.
It's happened in Georgia.
And it's enabled us to recruit and retain.
In the public defender's world,
I never thought we would have that.
Normally, I come here and I want to tell you
all we have achieved over the last year.
But today, I would be remiss if I did not just stop.
I just say thank you.
I am full because even from last year,
I'm still thinking as to how much we have been able to get.
And so I just want to say thank you to all of you
because today we can do that job that we have in call to do
to represent the least of these,
but not just represent them in the courtroom,
to step outside the courtroom so that Kenya
can find them services in the community.
And at any point in time when you see that we need services
in your constituencies, give us a call.
We will be there with services
because that's what we're supposed to do.
The return of your investment is going to be measurable
because what we're going to do is that we will foster
positive transformation for all our clients
because our goal is to break the cycle of recidivism
and return them as healthy and productive members
of their communities.
We will improve continuity of representation for clients,
and there will be a system that better reflects
the values of fairness, efficacy, and accountability.
I just want to say thank you.
Before I pass it on to Terry,
CFO to do the needful by asking for what we need
for next year, I am grateful.
Thank you so much.
Thank you, Director Lee.
Thank you, Chairman Hillary, Chairman Hatchett and members of the General Assembly for the
opportunity to present the Governor's recommended budget for Georgia Public Defenders.
And we only have two programs and the first one is Public Defender Council.
was added one time salary supplement of $2,000 that comes at $135,000 for a
second program public defenders of course is the one time salary supplement at
1.5 million and also what was added was to offset the loss of ARPA funding for
complicate cases for $5.5 million. We do have one additional ask and that is for
parity for the pay scale to start retroactively to January 1st, 2026 for
parity with district attorneys, that's at a tune of $4.1 million.
For FY27, for our first program, these are all state-wide changes in adjustments.
And for our second program, one through four is also state-wide adjustments.
We do have, number five, an offset for the loss of ARPA funds at $6.2 million and also
to align our public defender salaries along with the district attorney salaries at $7.8
million.
Any questions?
You got a couple of questions that I think they're going to come from Chairman Gollett.
Gollett, I don't know if me and you will ask the same things.
You want to go first?
all right well thank you for your presentation I got a couple of things
first of all you know we've been very committed to keeping parity among the
district attorney's offices and the public defender's offices but one of the
things I'm starting to fall back on and wonder now is what is parity the right
thing so the reason I bring that up is I know that every single case that goes
this brought by the state is going to have to get defended by or prosecuted by
district attorney's office and the assistant district attorney. Clearly you'll
have private attorneys that enter into the public defender space. So I need to
understand your case count or does everything go into into J Katz, every
case count you have? All case count. And I'm sorry, thanks for coming up and just
stating your names with the rest of the folks know you in here. Good afternoon. I am
D'Andre Berry and you keep up with the data for among other things, right?
So we're also making the juvenile courts to an extent move into J-Cats so we can have
a little bit more transparency there, too.
So this isn't us picking on you.
We just need to understand the data of where things break down.
I got this case load summary.
I know you've had some issues where you've hired conflict people, et cetera.
How do I know if I'm comparing apples to apples how many cases each public defender has?
Is there a way you can tell me that, or do you have that info with you?
I can pull that data and provide it to you, sir, but yes, so we have the ability to give
you that data.
J.Cats will help.
Yes, sir.
And I'll say that so that other people understand why we're asking people to put things either
in J-Cats are some of the formulas.
Not trying to micro-manage you.
We just need to be able to see the data later on.
So even our court judges listening,
hopefully they understand that, too.
Can another thing that we do is we award judgeships
based on case counts, and you know that.
The way that we've moved with your conflict system
kind of makes my circuit break down the public defender
offices, I don't want to say skewed,
but maybe that's the best word to use.
you've got conflict and you've got obviously your Circuit of Public Defenders and then
the assistance that come underneath it.
Can we get a breakdown of what each circuit looks like if there's employees per circuit
and sort of, and then of course, if we've got cases for that, we can do the case counts
accordingly.
Would that be something that J-Cats would show us as well or something you can get for
us?
We have the ability to break down the staff,
not from Jcats, but from the state system.
From the statutory budget, you can hold the date of it.
I can hear you, but I know that the folks listening
are watching or hearing out there, maybe can't.
So for statutory positions, say Alapaha has three attorneys.
You would like to see from just a statutory standpoint,
how many cases they have, and how much each attorney has.
Well, the statutory matters to me,
But also if you've done some other hiring with other funds,
whether it be county funds, et cetera,
it just helps us understand why we may have bottlenecks
in certain areas as to others.
We could do that.
We're wanting to get a better grasp of that.
Yeah, we could do that.
We could have state county contract employees,
this conflict contractors.
We could do that for each circuit what we have
and how many cases are assigned to that judicial circuit.
One other thing I'm gonna wonder in that data
is how many cases each conflict attorney has
because one thing we've heard from judges is
I have multi-defendants in a case.
I can't set a scheduling hearing
because that attorney has 30 clients
and they're in courtroom B and I need them in C.
So again, we're trying to understand all of this.
As you know, we work through this entire summer chairman
Gullet has really spent his entire summer.
appreciate his leadership on the, I won't call it a study committee, is that my
mic? No working group and what's going on but those are things I'd like to
see too and as we follow up on the work that we've already been working on
through all of this summer. Yeah thank you thank you Chairman for your
help this summer too you came and spent as much time as I did on those
Thank you. I do have a question just related to ARPA funds. How long have ARPA funds been used for
conflict cases? How long have we been using ARPA funds on conflict cases? Since 2022.
Four years. Four counties. Do you have any idea of how much total ARPA money that was on conflict cases?
Not right this minute, but we've allocated as much as we got to the
Conflict cases, I don't want to give you both a park figure that's not correct
But I can get it for you. That'd be great. Just because I'm trying to see if we have four years of opera funds
You're asking for five million now or you know more five million now for this to continue
And so what is the I'm trying to see what the future holds for for conflict cases from a money for using opera funds
that was really the kind of get us out of COVID but now it's costing the
state now $5 million to kind of keep up with what was really a one-time
funding mechanism for complicate cases. Related to the salary study are there
any to the changes have kind of implemented we're gonna you know figure out
how to get this thing funded from the from the the parity with the DA's and
the the funding mechanism for salaries but are there any APDs that make more
other CPDs today, or make more than their CPD?
And don't believe so.
I don't believe so.
And the ones who are making out of the salary studies
that we did during the summer, if it's beyond that range,
what we're going to do is grandfather then.
We don't anticipate cutting any one salary,
but we are not going to increase.
So what we'll do is red line so that those salaries
not increasing until the attain a higher rate higher status rather just over the next
couple days if you can look and see if there's any APDs make you more CPDs we don't believe
so but if I go back and I see that I'll let you know okay thank you and to say
something about the conflict cases the reason why we have the conflict cases is
not it's not attributed to us is because of the indictment the cases that
Again, in diamond, if we get 161 single case
in diamond, we have to find 159 attorneys for those.
But one thing we're doing because of the concurrence,
I just came from the Supreme Court,
we're working on a different kind of model
that we think is going to make a difference
in how we assign conflict cases.
We're working with our CPDs, and I think we can come up
with a different formula by the end of March.
I have reached out to your office to see
to discuss that as well.
Yeah, great.
I appreciate that.
And I know I think the Supreme Court's
probably going to write rules and regs or regulations
around that.
So thank you.
I think that's going to be important.
And I think it's ultimately going to hopefully
drive down some costs associated to conflict cases,
whatever those rules are.
We believe so.
And we're working on that in a way
that's going to actually make it better for us
to represent our clients better and at the same time
reduce the cost to the taxpayers.
So we're working on that with all the parties involved,
and we will be in touch so that we can keep you informed
as to how we're doing that.
Right, thank you so much.
Thanks for being here.
Chairman donor.
Thank you, Chairman.
Okay, on your $7.8 million to align
assisted public defender salaries
to the assisted district attorney salary.
About a year ago, I guess,
I was thinking that y'all are at 71,000
with your assistant public defenders
and the DA's were at around 68, 60, 1 or 2000.
So this number doesn't make sense to me
that you're asking for more money to align
because they weren't making as much as the folks.
That's what I'm asking, how do we get here?
So what we did at that point,
As we looked at both the supplement and what the state was offering.
So we went to the state allocation as well as the supplement if there was one from the
county.
For the assistant public defenders.
So now we're doing what the prosecutors are doing, straight state salary.
All right, so let's build it.
Can I?
Were you using the ARPA funds to pay the $71,000 payments, then I'm confused too.
So can you walk us back through that one more time?
Yeah, I was the our understanding last year was you were paying the public the public defender.
I guess average or maybe is actually set rate was set or starting rate was 71,000
which sent the public the prosecuting attorneys into a little bit of a
Knowsdive because they were like hey, where's parity?
So they brought us a proposal now to meet you but the number on here
here is showing that you need more money to be at parity with them that we thought we
were moving them to parity with you at, so that's accurate, right, exactly, yes.
So it was in 2023? 2023 we received two appropriations and when we applied all of that, our first
line, APD1 went to 72, not APD2, not APD3, not APD4. It was nothing that we did. It was
because we received two separate appropriations to increase retention and to increase retention
and to improve hiring, is that? Those were the two. And so when we applied those two appropriations
that we got, the salaries of APD once went to 72,000
with the exception of three or four employees.
We didn't do anything to cost that.
We did not sell the salaries.
It was just what happened when we got those
to appropriations.
What were the numbers tearing?
It was, do you remember?
So there were only four employees who did not make it up to that 72 when we applied those
to appropriations but it was only APD 1 and now we are doing it for APD 1, 2, 3, 4 and we're
happy to be joining the prosecutors in the pay plan with steps. So when you heard
that we were paying more, we truly were not. It was just appropriations that
brought this APD 1 up to 72, not the second, third and fourth levels. And that
was caused by those two appropriations that we got that particular year. But now
Now we have the same common pay plan we're going from APD-1, APD-2, APD-3 realizing that
our APD-2 that was not affected by that increase, not everybody is going up.
I hope I can explain it.
When you started, you had an APD-1 or an APD-4.
We just did APD-1 at that time.
If I was hard today, would I be at APD-1 or an APD-4, or I'd be an APD-1, right?
APD-1.
So if they were at 71, you're saying your two, three, and fours were less?
Well, some of them had gone up to that.
They were not affected.
So we have sought money to get everybody up, but we did not receive the money at that time.
And so we'll go into it and subcommittee, I guess, the county is more clear.
Senator, Representative Chalkis, did you have a question?
Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
In the case load, do you break down the case load between first offenders and second and
third offenders? Is there any way you could get us that information? Is there any way we
We can get the information on the offenders that you represent if they're first-time offenders
or their multiple offenders, is there any information on that?
Yes, sir, our case management system can partially get that information for the most part
you can't, but I can definitely provide you with what the system is able to do.
Thank you.
I think that would be very interesting. Just know how many times you're seeing
repeat people. I think that's what Representative Chukus is asking and how
often. Any other questions? Thanks. We look forward to following up with subcommittee
maybe understand better. Thank you for your for being here today.
What I might be able to do is send you some paperwork.
Thank you, sir.
I'm going to go ahead, Mr. Hatchett.
Our next presenters will be the Prosecuting Attorney's Council.
.
.
.
.
Director Scandalakis, we made again, you're the last one today.
I ran into Chairman Powell outside a little bit earlier and he said, keep it short.
No, no, no, no, no, be careful with what he said.
Well, it's a pleasure to be here, Chairman Haset, I appreciate it.
Chairman Hatchett, Chairman Tillery, Chairman Gullet.
My good Greek colleague over there,
Representative Chokis, Chairman Chokis,
always a pleasure to be here.
With me as District Attorney Herb Cramford,
Herb is the budget chair for the DA's association.
He's also a council member.
He will be presenting the budget for us today,
and I'll be available to answer questions.
Also with us is Chris Jones, our chief financial officer,
and Katherine Camp, who's also in our financial department.
We're all here to answer your questions,
but I will turn it over to Herb,
and I promise you we will be short.
Thank you, Pete.
Yeah, thank you all for having us.
This whole presentation is 14 slides,
and I aim to move very quickly, okay?
So this is the big budget ask,
The number one priority for DAs this year is increasing elected DA pay.
They're 51 DAs.
Our request would put us at 88% of federal district judge pay as compared to superior court
judges last year, y'all moved to 90% of federal district court judge pay.
If we got funded fully at 88%, the salary would be that 196 number.
Our reasons for that are twofold primarily.
One, all the states that touch Georgia paid elected DA's more than the state of Georgia.
So currently elected DA's state pay is at a little over 132,000.
The next closest is North Carolina at 167,000.
And it goes all the way to Florida to over 218,000.
Second, y'all really helped us out last year by increasing state ADA pay.
We moved the floor for a new ADA from like 64,000 to 72,000.
We moved the ceiling for a state paid ADA from like 125,000 to 134,000.
The result was there are now 83 state paid assistant DAs in the state of Georgia who are
making more than their elected DA.
So out of 400 something state paid ADAs in the state of Georgia, 83 are at the top of
of pay scale, making more than their elected DA.
For assistant DAs, we are asking, at very least, for a step increase, just so they, you know,
the people that stick with us, the people that try the most serious cases in our offices,
that they're still getting a merit increase every year.
Those are the people that have committed their career to prosecution and we want to reward
them for that obviously.
Year two of the competitive plan to skip forward to show you that, in fiscal year 2025, starting
ADA pay was at 60, the top of the scale was at 125.
What y'all did last year is that FY26 year one of this three year plan.
We now start state-funded ADA's at 72,000 and they max out at 134.
Year two of this plan, if you chose to do that this year, would be starting salaries at
78,000 and it would max out at 157 at the top of the scale.
So again, we're asking for two things for ADA's.
There are 437 state-paid ADAs in the state of Georgia, a step increase, and if you're
willing to also give us year two of that three-year plan.
Keep in mind, helping out state-funded ADAs disproportionately helps the smaller offices.
There are some DAs in the state of Georgia that get no county funding, they get no county
be paid assistant DA's, their offices entirely dependent on what the state of Georgia will
do for their offices.
My office, I'm in County County Lagrange, Maryweather, I'm kind of in the middle, about half
of my state-funded ADA's are funded by my counties, the other half are funded by the state
of Georgia.
But I think it's worth noting there are multiple offices that are very dependent on what
the state of Georgia does. Vacancy trends going back to July 2022 out of those
437 state paid ADA's we've been over 30 vacancy statewide going back to
early 2023 and we remain over 30 roughly you know 9 to 10% roughly of our
state ADA's have been vacant for the last few years.
ADA turnover, you can see 2017, 18, 19, and 20.
It was in the teens as a percentage.
Since 2020, it's remained over 20% as a percentage.
And unfortunately, since 23 has ticked up the last three years.
So we've still got a turnover issue.
Just to give you an example, I've got six
assisted DA positions in Troop County since 2023.
I've lost nine assisted DAs in that one county.
And I presented that to my commission
and city council recently.
So a lot of offices are experiencing
that kind of turnover.
And every new person you gotta train
and get them up to speed before you can give them a case
that anybody in the community's gonna care about, right?
So it's a real problem, this kind of turnover.
This is where we're at out of the 437 assistant DAs.
Only 25, when we pulled these numbers recently,
were brand new out of law school.
245 out of 437 are in our class four.
That's the top class.
So we're struggling to get new people in
and keep them.
And thankfully, we've got a lot of career prosecutors,
but we're hollowing out in that middle zone.
And that's what our three-year plan is really meant to address.
We can tell somebody, if you start with me at a law school,
in 10 years, you'll be making over $100,000, for example.
Right?
The career prosecutors handle murders, sex crimes,
crimes against children.
Those are really the most important prosecutors in our offices.
Next, we're kind of moving into the PAC program budget.
We split the Caluida Circuit a couple of years ago.
The new circuit is Carroll and Hurd County, the West Georgia
Circuit.
PAC has been using funding to cover the investigator victim
advocate and legal assistant positions.
And we're just looking for full funding for those administrative non-lawyer positions.
The total budget need for those four positions is right under $500,000.
The conflict case program was started a few years ago.
I think after 2020, there was a lot of turnover among DAs as a result of elections.
and a private lawyer becomes DA,
they're conflicted from prosecuting a lot of cases
in their circuit.
We started the conflict program as a separate program
with the idea that it would go away.
Once we handled all those conflicts,
then we wouldn't need those conflict prosecutors at PAC.
Keep in mind, the Attorney General's Office
used to handle conflicts in the state of Georgia.
For reasons that I couldn't tell you the answer, conflicts have stayed high.
We continue to receive a lot of conflicts, PAC does.
One thing to keep in mind, PAC can't scrutinize an elected DA who says, I have a conflict.
The law doesn't allow PAC to say, no, you don't.
So they have to accept all these conflicts.
PAC is handling over 50% of the cases conflicted by elected DAs.
The other 46% or so are handled by other DAs offices.
And if I pick up a conflict, I've got to send an ADA to another county.
That means they can't handle cases in our county.
So I really appreciate the fact that PAC is now able to handle in-house conflicts.
So part of our ask is to move what was a separate program into the PAC program and we're
asking for a step for those conflict prosecutors and if ADA's get year two of the three year
plan, we'd like that to apply to the prosecutors at PAC as well.
And this is what I was talking about, moving the program over to the PAC program.
There would be a little bit of savings here.
This is at the $200,000 that we would reduce our current budget allocation by.
This is what I was talking about.
of 512 conflicts referred in 2025 compared to 215 in 2024.
Pat candles a majority of those.
And that was my best effort to move through that quickly.
We're all happy to take any questions if y'all have any.
I know we're last, but.
Thank you.
Chairman Gollett.
Thank you.
I have a couple of questions.
One on the three-year retention.
So the ask is for elected DAs for pay increase, 88%.
And I want to get there.
But when I see the numbers continue to trickle up on 25%,
20% I guess, you know, 24, your 2024, 2025,
And your three-year plan, retention plan is going to get hit.
I think I was, I know we've had conversations,
hey, it's, both can't happen, right?
It makes me struggle to say, you know,
you're saying retention is a problem.
I mean, it's clearly a problem.
But I don't know how, paying, fixing the elected DA pay,
is going to help with retention.
I know you got to, we got to balance.
We got to walk and chew gum at the same time.
But 25% is really, it's not sustainable.
I don't think it's the DA programs.
And so what would you say to that, I guess, as far as you know?
Electives, as an elected, we know what we're getting into.
I said this for the judges too.
We know what our pay was.
And yes, judges got their pay raise.
We do need to figure this out.
But it's a difficult ask at the moment to me to say,
electives need it.
But we have a 25% retention rate.
and this is a problem too.
So, you have a, it's a hard question,
but it's a different response on it.
I mean, my take on that is, I think it is two problems,
both need to be solved in my view.
That's why when we had those discussions with you
and other appropriators, I guess, more than a year ago,
we said, look, we're not trying to keep up with the judges,
you know, this year, our priorities are assistant DAs
getting this first year implemented,
that took effect in January of 25.
So I at least can speak for of 26.
I mean, so it just took effect in 26.
So at least speaking for the conversations
I've had with the ADA's in my office,
that just hit their pocketbooks, they're very thankful.
I'm transparent with them about the fact
that I and DAs are prioritizing elected DAPA
over year two of the year three plan,
this fiscal year, and they understand that.
And at least in my office, they're supportive of that,
in part because they know we're committed
to years two and three in the plan.
And I don't, I would like to think that year two
of the plan would totally fix the turnover problem.
I don't know that it will.
I think it really is that three-year plan.
And I would love for that to take place in three years in a row.
I understand that may not.
If we can get there in five years, that's better than not
getting there at all.
And so yeah, it's not a fun choice to make.
But last year, we prioritized the ADAs.
And just candidly, this year, we're
prioritizing elected DAPA.
If we got year two for ADA's, I think top of the scale,
they'd be at what, 150, if I recall correctly,
from the slide.
And so we'd be, elected DA's would be
that much more underwater, you know,
from their assistance.
Look how do you pay, or look how do you cap
with the idea to tell me a little bit,
especially like other things.
Sure, yeah, so I'm,
Our thinking on proposing a DA pay bill was to essentially follow the framework that the
judges used.
They got 90% of federal district court judge pay, that paid from 2022, so we're asking
to get no more than 88%.
Understanding we may not get that fully funded, right?
are proposing we increase the retirement age. I think you know everybody would
love to keep it at 60 or 62. I understand that it's likely to be moved to
65 where the judges are just to be candid. We've also proposed the same cap on
county supplement pay. What's called locality pay? I believe the judges were
cap at 10%, and if the funding we got was substantially lower than 88%, that could create
a problem, but if we're relatively close to where the judges end up, we're proposing
a 10% cap just like the judges got.
Are there currently any ADAs making more than a DA?
The assistant DA is making more than the elected DA?
Yes.
That's that.
And the same circuit.
Yes.
Okay.
Yeah. There are some circuits that get no county funding that have, you know, an ADA or two at least that are at the top of that scale.
Making more than the elected DA.
Sarah, we got other questions.
Oh, all right.
One more question.
This is pretty in pay.
So, with the DA's who have, I guess, presumably more than one county in their circuit, do they
get pretty impay or do they get mileage going between and do the ADA's get that as well?
ADA's, as I understand it, you have a home office and if you travel from your home to a different
office and that commute is longer than it is to your home office, you would get mileage for the excess.
Your other question was about do DAs get speaking for myself if I go to any of my
three counties or before the split if I was going to any of my five counties I'm
lucky enough to have a state vehicle so I wasn't asking for mileage there may be
DAs that don't have a state vehicle that that's secret reimbursements I would
imagine the same rule applies to them they've got a primary office for which
they would not get mileage but if they travel further than their primary
office as I understand the law, they could get mileage for that.
Chairman Chakus.
Question I have is the same one I asked for the public defenders.
Do you have any numbers on your recidivism, on the number of prosecutions I'll have, or repeat offenders?
I don't know, you know, a lot of prosecutors in Georgia use a case-manage system called
Tracker that was made for prosecutors, the Prosecuting Attorney's Council helped develop
that software.
We can run a lot of reports that give us good data on different things.
I don't know that we currently have that software where it can run a report on recidivism,
But as I heard you ask that question, I wondered, is that something we could develop?
You know, I mean, the names are the same, right?
So it seems like that's something we could do.
I'm not a tech guru like Chairman Gullet here, but I think that's something we could
look into and try to do.
Chairman Gunner.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Okay, so I feel like I've been asleep for a year.
Sorry about that.
Can you catch me up on the changes in the step system because apparently I'll
go on from a four or five step system to a three step, right, or how's that work?
Chris would be the best start of that, but my quick understanding is there are four classes.
Once somebody gets through steps one, two, three, and four for each class they graduate to the next class.
except class four has multiple steps that once you're into class four and you
stay a prosecutor you just keep going up so when we increased state pay the
top of the scale from 125 to 134 at 125 the most you could get was class four
step eight at one thirty-four if I'm looking at this graph right it increased
a step or two yeah one step I guess yeah so now you can get step nine. This is the
same scale that y'all have for a long time. For a long time. Okay, okay, we're
percent of hope. Thank you Mr. Chairman. I don't understand the complex problem that you're
raising. Is it an actual complex problem or are people just declining working on cases like what's
going on here? This doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Yeah. For whatever reason, the last few years
there have been more cases conflicted than our understanding of how many cases were conflicted
historically. One thing to keep in mind is these conflicts also include conflicts from solicitor
generals and part-time solicitors. So a lot of counties have a part-time solicitor that also has
a local law practice and again they could feel like they have a conflict for a lot of different
reasons and pack legally can't question that. Typically conflicts would jump after election
years because there's new elected prosecutors, solicitors, or D.A.'s, they had a private practice,
they obviously can't prosecute somebody they represented. So historically they were used to the
bumps in the years after elections. For whatever reason that increased the last few years has stayed
up there. Well it depends on what you represent the person for, so that you can potentially be at
first to a prior client if it's a different action, if it's something where you
learn information that's related to that subsequent issue then you clearly
would be complicated but there are situations where it's a totally different
subject matter totally different. It's not automatic or as simple as you
represented somebody so you're automatically out. I agree and if the implicit
This suggestion is that it might be helpful to have rules about what is a conflict and
what isn't, I would agree with that.
But right now, as the elected DA, I could call Pete tomorrow and say, I have a conflict
on these 200 cases and he'd have to say, okay, I'll figure out somebody to handle them.
And I wouldn't have to say why I think I had a conflict.
Typically, I don't think people do.
They just say I have a conflict.
But I agree with the point you're making, like ethically, yeah.
I have a conflict for the rest of this session.
Representative Evans.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
One quick preparatory question.
We're in year one of a three year
paced up up for the ADA, is that right?
Only then one year or three, OK.
And then one other preparatory question,
Y'all's budget that you're presenting here today,
this is your presentation,
the governor doesn't weigh in on your budget
because of the separation of powers, true.
That's correct.
A couple of things I heard,
I'm gonna repeat, you can tell me if I heard them
right or wrong, I just want you to comment on them.
Sure.
We have every elected DA position is filled, true.
But we have a problem retaining assistant DAs, right?
Correct.
Crucial levels in some areas, right?
Yeah, I would say particularly rural areas, yeah.
I assume we have shared with the ADAs the presentation of the step up over three years.
While they know it's at the discretion of the legislature, they would assume, I think,
that they're elected DAs and that PAC is going to advocate for the rest of those steps.
I think that would be a fair assumption, don't you?
Yes, like steps two and three.
Correct.
But you're down here asking us to jump off the one, two, three in favor of a pay raise
to elected DA's where we don't have vacancies,
but we do have vacancies of ADA's.
I'm trying to understand how that's responsible
for leaders of offices that are responsible
for making sure that bad guys are on the street
and how it's responsible to ask us to prioritize that
when we know we've gotten these vacancies.
Yeah, well, to be clear, we're asking for both.
Chairman Gullet asked me, you know.
But if you had to prioritize, which one are you picking?
Yeah, if the DA's on behalf of the DA's that voted,
and I personally agree with this,
like I said, I've spoken to my office about it,
and they supported.
This year, if we're asked to prioritize one over the other,
it would be elected DA pay.
And we continue to want ADA pay,
whether that be one step or a step
and year two of the three year plan.
And are the ADA's in other offices
aware that their PAC council and their bosses are down there advocating for us to choose
them over the ADA's if a choice is required. I understand you want both, but when we ask
you, push comes to shove, if we can only give you one, which one do you want? That's the
message.
I don't know what other DA's have said or not said to their office. I know what I've communicated
to my office, and I would say like I said earlier, just, I guess, this month, at the end
of the month, all those ADAs are going to get the substantial increase that this legislature
gave last year, right?
So I think they're very appreciative of what Y'all did for them, and I think they understand
the leaders of their offices, you know, they all want a good boss to, right?
And I think they understand, at least the ones I talk to, I imagine a lot of ADAs understand.
Having the position of your boss being the lowest paid elected DA in the southeast just
isn't a good thing.
And so I do think, yeah, they would definitely like step two.
They would definitely like more money, don't get me wrong.
that would help the turnover problem,
but elected DA pay is a problem as well.
And it's not just, yes,
and my personal financial interest don't get me wrong,
but as a policy matter,
I think this is a legitimate issue
being this much lower paid than other states.
Perhaps when we have our subcommittee hearings,
we could have some ADAs come in.
I would be very interested to know if surveys have been taken across other offices and how
those ADAs feel and even more so perhaps other members of the criminal justice system about
how the system doesn't work when we don't have ADAs and that I want somebody to tell
me why not filling those positions is not the priority over raising DAPA.
That would be good for subcommittee.
One other question if I might, Mr. Chairman on a different subject.
of money is running out? How are y'all feeling in those gaps?
Yes, I'm glad you asked that. This occurred to me during the prior presentation as well.
I noticed they were asking for ARPA funds. As I understand it, the Public Defender Standards
Council was given ARPA money directly. DAs, to the extent we got ARPA money, it went through
AOC and was subject to the decisions of our chief judge.
So early on in the ARPA process, before our circuit split, my office got new ARPA money
for those first two or three years.
Now we've got a circuit split and I've got a different chief judge.
The last year and this year, I have gotten ARPA money to fund one ADA.
I can tell you, we've had no discussions,
maybe we're dumb or something,
but we've had no discussions about coming to the legislature
to ask for y'all to cover our ARPA allocations.
My understanding is I've got to go to my county to do that,
and I intend to do that just so you know,
but I haven't had a single discussion with a single DA
that we expect the legislature to to pick up off the dollars thank you looks like
that's all the prosecuting you get today all right thank you all thank you all very much
y'all we are finished we start like I have it eight in the morning just in case some of you haven't
seen on the speaker and I don't know if the Senate is addressed or not but Monday we will not
have to be here but the speaker is going to gavill in so it counts as a day but we will not be
expected to be here Monday. But be here tomorrow. Thank you.
