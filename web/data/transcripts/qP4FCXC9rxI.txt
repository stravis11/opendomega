TRANSCRIPT
----------
HV1 is a democratic bill called the Pediatric Safe Storage Act.
That's what we rushed to this house.
That's what we brought a desire to protect our students, a desire to protect young people
from making a tragic mistake that harms them or others.
That's what Democrats brought you.
This is SB1.
SB1, the Senate's first priority,
is a problem that does not exist.
Passion still run high in the waning days of the 2025 session
as SB1, which bans transgender athletes
from female sports, finally gets debated in the house.
Good evening and welcome to lawmakers.
on a Lowry in Atlanta.
It's day 38 of the Georgia legislative session.
Things are heating up on the last week at the Capitol
and the longer days are already underway.
They just wrapped up in both chambers.
Tonight, we've dive into some election bills.
We expect debated in the coming days.
We'll also take a closer look at proposed legislation
aimed at supporting older adults in assisted living
and personal care homes, as well as the caregivers
who help them.
And if you're like many of us,
you probably have a few monthly subscriptions
for music or entertainment,
that you might not think about much.
We'll discuss legislation that can make it much easier
to cancel those subscriptions when you want to.
And if your driver's license is on your phone,
you may be wondering where and when you can use it.
We'll hear from two legislators
who are pushing to expand those options.
But first, we turn to our busy capital correspondence
Sarah Callis for a look at what happened today under the Gold Dome.
Hi, Donna.
Both chambers took up dozens of bills on the first day of the last week of the session.
The Senate took on 27 house bills on the rules calendar, most notable HP 268, which increases
school safety.
Before the bill's presentation, Senator Bill Callisert read the names of Appalachia
high school shooting victims and asked for a moment of silence.
Senators asked for a moment of silence.
The bill sets up a variety of new elementary and secondary school safeguards and protocols,
including school mapping for forced responders, transferring a student's academic and legal
records among schools and law enforcement within a required period, and creating a statewide
emergency alert system. A database of student misconduct proposed in the house's original
version was removed because of parents concerns.
Parents kept coming and being heard saying, I don't think I want my child to be persecuted
for life because they do something stupid in the eighth grade and they say, man, I'd
like to blow this building up.
I didn't good to say, but I didn't mean they're going to do it.
And if the school faculty didn't think it was significant enough or serious enough
to give them disciplinary action and create a record, why should we have this shadow
database, so to speak, on misconduct of students?
Democrats wanted to add language that would take children with certain cognitive limitations
into consideration, but that amendment failed.
The bill was passed 45 to 9.
After years of effort, 33 black legislators elected in 1868 during reconstruction and
then expelled.
One of the first African-American legislators elected in the U.S. will finally be recognized
at the Capitol.
House Bill 303 will place memorial on Capitol grounds honoring the men.
Simply honoring their sacrifice that they made back then when they went up against all
odds.
Also today, the Senate insisted on its substitute to House Bill 68.
The Senate insisted on their version of the fiscal year 2026 budget after the House rejected
the Senate's changes.
A conference committee with the House was then agreed upon to hammer out their differences
to finalize the budget by Friday.
In the House, members unanimously passed Senate Bill 93, where the Georgia Early Literacy
Act.
The bill would create new guidelines for teaching reading to young students by banning
the three queuing system.
This ensures Georgia teachers are being trained in alignment with our science of reading standards.
It works to strengthen our efforts to end the reliance on the three queuing practice.
And it supports our teachers by making sure they are ready to teach, reading to our children
on day one in the classroom.
After lunch, the house took up one of the most contentious bills of the sessions.
Senate Bill One, SB one, would ban transgender girls from participating in girl sports and
require changing rooms to be separated by sex assigned at birth.
Democrats were quick to oppose the bill.
This is a manufactured crisis designed not to solve a real problem but to create division
and fear.
The NCAA has changed its policy on transgender athletes.
The IOC has rules in place that deal with transgender athletes.
The Georgia High School Association has rules that deal with transgender athletes.
I question why we must double down and triple down.
They have not asked us for this,
but Republicans say it protects the integrity
of the mail sports.
This legislation does not target individuals.
It targets inequities.
It safeguards the decades of progress made in women's
athletics by reaffirming the state's interests
and promoting equal opportunity
and preventing unfair advantages.
The bill also respects privacy by ensuring
that shared facilities used during competitions,
such as locker rooms, restrooms, and sleeping quarters
are designated and used according to biological sex.
While still often reasonable accommodations for all students,
it prohibits males from competing in female sports.
thereby protecting the competitive balance and physical safety that women
sports depend upon. The bill passed 100 to 64 and was immediately transmitted to
the Senate. The House took up another controversial school related bill, SB 82.
The bill would create financial incentives for local school boards to
approve petitions for new charter schools and penalize school systems that
repeatedly deny charter school proposals that have been approved by the state
charter school commission. Supporters say SB 82 expands options for students.
What this bill does is simply it's a very modest proposal to encourage local school boards
to provide more public school options to students.
But opponents say that the bill is taxing on local education systems.
Not only does it usurp their elected responsibilities, but it pressures them to approve charter
school applications and lays the groundwork for increased privatization of all of our
public schools. The bill passed 107 to 62 in a mostly party line vote.
Committees will meet tomorrow, but the House and Senate floor sessions will be back on Wednesday.
That's my Capitol report, Donna.
Thanks, Sarah. Two state senators join us now to talk about election bills,
legislation to help older adults and caregivers and more.
Republican Senator Randy Robertson of Catala is the Senate majority whip.
The former law enforcement officer shares the public safety committee and is the secretary
of government oversight and Democratic Senator Jason Estevez of Atlanta. His committees include
ethics, finance, children and families, agriculture, and consumer affairs. Welcome to lawmakers,
gentlemen. Thank you for joining us from the Capitol. I know you guys just wrapped up in the
Senate, not too long ago.
Thank you, Donna.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you so much for having us.
It's been a long day.
A long day.
So we're going to get right to it.
Chairman Robertson, you have a couple of election bills.
And let's start with SB 175, which would prohibit the use
of ranked choice voting in elections.
Explain how it would work.
Well, ranked choice voting has shown itself
around the country to be a confusing and problematic process and I think we
solved a lot of the issues in Georgia with SB 202 and we've shown ourselves to
be able to have a turnout that does better than most places around the
country and has been very effective and very efficient. Our voter lines are
moving swiftly. The confusion has been moved to a minimum and we still have individuals
on both sides of the aisle attempting to find confusion in our elections and there's
been a move around the country and there's a move here in Georgia to bring right choice
voting in here which I think will undo a lot of the good things that SB 202 have done
and the things that we continue to do in our ethics committee here in the Georgia State
Senator Estabés, you voted against it, tell us why.
I did.
I believe that ranked-choice voting should be an option that our municipalities should
be able to use, particularly in an effort to save money.
Elections in Georgia cost taxpayers, especially local taxpayers, a lot of money, and we should
to be ensuring that our municipalities and our counties
have options available to them that could potentially save money.
And ranked choice voting has been shown
to be successful across the country,
and I don't see a need to hamstring our local folks.
OK, I want to stick with elections for a little moment
and talk about how spill you've both seen
in the Senate Ethics Committee, HB 397,
which would allow for sweeping changes to Georgia's elections.
It deals with everything from paper ballots
to getting rid of the system that allows states
to share voter information known as Eric.
So let's start with you, Chairman Robertson.
Tell us your feelings on that bill.
Well, it's a very multi-layered piece of legislation.
I think we started a couple of meetings ago
to try to dissect it and pull it apart
while I find a lot of it intriguing and positive.
I do think we have a little more work to do
to make sure that again,
that we're keeping the field clear
and transparent for our voters as they go out.
And there are good changes we can make,
but we have to understand we cannot undo
the good things we did with SB202.
Yeah, you voted to pass it out of the ethics committee.
Senator Estebes, you voted against it.
Tell us why.
I did, and Donna, I'll let you know
that I'm very glad that the authors of the bill
remove provision in one of the drafts
that would have limited counties across the state
to one early voting location.
That scared me to death thinking about
whether it's Muscogee County,
whether it's thinking about Fulton County,
it would have made early voting in our elections a mess.
And we've gone a long way to make early voting easy
for voters and I would hate to make that much harder
by some of the language that had been originally included.
Now, the current draft of the bill still has its issues,
which is why I voted against it.
The main issue that I have is if we're trying
to keep clean voting rolls, then we need to make sure
that we have a safe way to exchange data with other states.
And right now, the only organization that does that is Eric.
And I'm concerned that by requiring the Secretary of State
to remove the state of Georgia from that organization,
we would be relying on one-on-one bilateral agreements
with 50 states across the country.
And I have some cybersecurity concerns.
I have privacy concerns with that.
And I think that we should be using taxpayer money
efficiently and as effectively as possible.
And there's a perfectly good organization that's
helped us with keeping track of voters.
I'm not sure why we would all of a sudden make a change
because of conspiracy theories and opinions of folks
on what the purpose of Eric is.
Well, that's certainly one bill we'll be watching this week.
Senator Estevez, I want to change gears a little bit.
You have three bills dealing with older adults
and assisted living and personal care homes
and their caregivers.
So as be 186, 87, 188.
I understand this topic is personal for you,
but what would the legislation do?
Yeah, so I'm a caregiver of mom with Alzheimer's.
She's an unfortunate late-stage Alzheimer's
and my wife and I have had to navigate
providing care for her.
And I've seen how challenging the senior care system is
in the state.
And Donna, we have more seniors in the state
than we do young people than we do babies.
So we need to make sure that we're doing all that we can
to ensure that our seniors are able to grow old
with dignity, respect, and love.
And that means ensuring that they have a roof over their heads
and making sure that they're receiving the care that they need.
So the bills that I've introduced, one would expand,
Medicaid to ensure that we're not forcing our seniors
to go broke before they receive support.
Right now, seniors essentially have to go to a nursing home
before they receive state support.
They could be perfectly fine at home or in a personal care
home or in a assisted living facility with lower levels
of care.
That would save them heartache, but it would also
save taxpayer dollars.
I also introduced a bill to significantly increase
the caregiver tax credit.
Right now, that tax credit is $150.
And for all you caregivers out there,
you know that that's a drop in the bucket
based on what we spend to care for our loved ones.
And then the last bill that I introduced related to this topic
is a bill that would create an agency on aging.
We have agencies dedicated to our children,
to our families, to public safety, to mental health.
There's a group that's just as important as all those.
And those are our seniors.
So we should be ensuring that our seniors
have our focus in this building, focus in our budget,
and ensuring that there's an agency head
and an apartment focused on this topic,
I think would help coordinate care
and ensure that our seniors are receiving the care
that is there.
Okay, well, we'll keep watch on that one.
I know that didn't pass out this year,
but you'll keep it going.
A Chairman Robertson, I want to get back with you
about another.
It's going to continue.
Okay, another bill that passed out of the Senate
along party lines would keep inmates
from receiving six change care.
Can you tell us about it briefly?
Yeah, just briefly, what it would do is basically
anybody that identifies as transgender,
they would be treated in prison
just the way they are now when they were to go inside.
If there was any particular therapies
or things like that, that they are owned,
as long as it was not therapy related to transitioning,
they would still be able to receive those
while in the Georgia Department of Corrections.
But those who go in there hoping to fully transition
while they're in there would not be able to do that
because this bill would prohibit state tax dollars
for being used to help individuals transition
from male to female or female to male
according to their definition
while being incarcerated in the Georgia Department
of Corrections.
All right, well thank you, Senator Estabez.
I'll just mention that you voted against it.
I apologize we don't have time to get into that,
but I did want that on record.
I want to thank you both for joining me
after a long, busy day at the Capitol.
I really appreciate this.
Donna, thank you always for support,
and we appreciate you, Greg.
Thanks for having us.
All right, thank you.
Well, coming up, when was the last time
you checked your monthly charges for Netflix, Spotify,
Amazon Prime, or new subscriptions?
Do they fall under hidden costs in your budget?
And it's hard to get rid of them?
Two house members are looking to make it easier
to get out of those contracts.
Stick around, and here what they have to say.
You're watching Lawmakers on GPP.
Georgia Farm Bureau, a grassroots organization
dedicated to preserving Georgia agriculture.
Farm Bureau advocates for all Georgia farmers
At the state capitol during the session and year round,
Georgia Farm Bureau, the voice of Georgia Farmers.
I'm a queen.
I don't fear anyone.
This was a woman.
People wanted to follow.
You are an important part of our work.
You're stronger than you know.
Saddle my horse immediately.
She's a female trailblazer.
We did it by acknowledging our own worth.
Oh, please.
Don't continue.
Understanding the past gives a sense of the future.
This is the first time that anyone has seen this in 2,000 years.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
What?
It's a battle against time.
You think I'm joking?
It really happened.
Don't let anybody tell you who you are.
I love this life, I love you.
History teaches us to honor the past.
When you look back, they're like, wow,
that was pretty special.
This is something that's actually
altering the course of history.
You're charged with keeping these stories alive.
I'm going to be here.
gotten about a recurring monthly subscription,
which they are still paying for,
but are no longer using.
Then there's this list that might seem familiar.
Here are the types of forgotten monthly subscriptions,
mobile phone, internet, TV, and movie streaming services,
Amazon Prime, music streaming, gaming, and news subscriptions,
and of course, other subscriptions.
And I'm sure a lot of us see ourselves on those lists
and recognize it's hard sometimes to cancel them.
That's one of the things we'll talk about with our guests.
Republican Representative Houston Gaines of Athens,
he's Vice Chair of House Appropriations,
and some of his other committee assignments include ethics,
governmental affairs, and insurance.
And Republican Representative Carter Barrett of coming,
he's Vice Chair of Education,
and also on the House Appropriations Committee,
as well as serving as secretary on both the banks
and banking and code revision committees.
Welcome to lawmakers, busy men who have been
at the Capitol all day.
So thank you so much for being on the show.
Thank you, Donald.
Thank you, Donald.
Well, you both have served as lead sponsors
on bills dealing with online subscription.
So, Representative Gaines, you led HP 528 last year.
And it became law on New Year's Day of this year.
So tell us what that does, and then we'll talk about this year.
Sure, well, as you mentioned, the onset,
you know, the number of consumers who have issues
when they go to a new subscription,
it's a challenge for many folks
because they want to cancel their subscription,
but it, it's not like this comes impossible
to cancel a lot of times and you get signed up for something.
And there's no way to get out of what you just subscribed to.
And so that bill we passed last year,
a consumer-friendly bill that allows and ensures
that if someone subscribes to something online,
they have to be able to cancel it online.
They wouldn't have to be forced to come in and person,
or even we heard of stories where someone was having
to send a letter by mail,
even if they signed up for the subscription online.
So as a consumer-friendly bill,
and this year represent Carter Barrett's
kind of outstanding bill to add to that work we did last year.
And looking forward to his bill getting
over the finish line as well,
as we try to continue to help consumers facing this issue.
Okay, representative Barrett,
so you have 529.
Tell us what that would do.
Well, Donna, I'm standing on the shoulders of giants
and Vice Chairman Gaines over here.
And he built a really nice foundational build
on which I could work off of.
You know, someone said to me,
where did the idea come from this bill?
I said, oh, it came because,
well, in just the last two months alone,
I've gotten six renewal notices
and I've missed about half of the emails
and I've had subscriptions going up dramatically
and you know a $52 subscription comes $275
and next year it'll become $480.
And I just thought this is just almost surreal.
And I thought what can we do differently
to maybe an ounce of prevention kind of a thing?
What can we do just to avoid the problem at all?
And I thought whenever I go buy a subscription,
let's say for a year, for a newspaper
an online, a serious satellite radio, something like that.
What if I could just make the thing terminate
at the end of that period?
Typically, what they'll do is take my credit card
and they'll say, okay, great, you were sending you up
and for your convenience, we're gonna go ahead
and put you on an automatic renewal.
And there's no problem at all, you'll just,
I mean, you can cancel them easily, it's no problem.
And then it's, but now the oneness is all me
to go put that on my calendar a year from now
and to pay attention and they'll send me an email
and I might see it or I might not,
because we all get 500 emails a week,
it seems like or more.
And if you don't catch those things,
sometimes they'll just automatically renew,
sometimes it'll dramatically hire a price.
In other cases, sometimes those people will come back
and say, oh, well, you miss your renewal,
we'll go ahead and credit you back.
And in fact, we've got an offer for you,
and we'll do it at a much lower price today.
Others will say, okay, you can cancel,
but your subscription's good through March of next year.
You're not getting your $100 back.
And so everyone sort of has a different iteration of this.
And these are mostly wonderful companies.
We just love to use all their services and products.
But I thought, what can we do differently?
I thought, what if we just set it up so that,
at the end of your term, your subscription's over?
So if a company wants to offer me an automatic renewal,
that's great.
But they should also offer me the ability
to have the thing terminate at the end of the term.
Because when I bought that newspaper subscription
for a year, I'm in a year.
So at the end of the year, if they provide a great service
and a reasonable price, I'm going to renew it anyway.
When I get my car and I want to go to the beach
and that radio doesn't turn on, I say,
you know what, I need to go renew that subscription.
That's kind of the premise of that's how we got started on this.
And so what your bill would do is it would make the subscription
end and people would have to renew it.
If they choose to do so, so a company can offer me
an automatic renewal if they won't.
And they also need to offer me the option
to have it terminated at the end.
It's going to shift the owners from me,
having to keep track of it,
to putting the owners back on them
so that they can come back and resell me
if I choose to have it terminated.
This bill is supported by the Georgia Council in aging.
You know, like I had someone say to me,
gee, the private equity funds don't like this bill
because they kind of like that whole get it
and forget it, mentality, from these subscriptions.
But I thought, well, there's almost 11 million
Georgia's, I think, who will.
And that's why the Georgia Council on Aging
and Sports has built.
As I took this through committee and the House,
and the Agriculture and Consumer Affairs Committee,
the chairman of that committee said,
this one of the better bills we've had this year.
And the fact is, it passed out of the committee unanimously,
then it passed the House with the vote of 169 to two.
So now it's over in the Senate.
I think it needs a little more.
It's in the Senate, we had a hearing on it,
and it's gonna take a little refining.
In fact, Senator Estevez and I met the other day,
and I met with Senator Dole's all this week,
and it's gonna take some refining.
I think we'll probably have it be
one of the first bills up next session, probably.
I don't see it going anywhere this year.
I think it will be a two year bill.
Okay, well, we'll keep an eye on it, certainly.
Cause some of us relate to it very much.
So, Representative Gaines,
I want to get to your bill on about driver's licenses
in the electronic format.
Some people have them on their phones,
but this will expand it to where you can use them,
who can look at them.
Talk about HB296.
Sure.
Sure, so there's another pro consumer bill.
Over 450,000 Georgians have the mobile driver's license
and encourage Georgians to get it on your Apple wallet
or Android wallet.
And if you go through, actually now through TSA security, you can use your mobile drivers
license.
But if you're pulled over by law enforcement officer in Georgia, you cannot.
And so what this bill would do would be ensure if you're pulled over by law enforcement officer,
you'd be able to show your mobile drivers license, they would be able to scan it at your vehicle,
so they don't take your phone back to their car, they could scan it, tap to touch technology
as they are now.
But this does give two years for law enforcement to give the technology that they would need
in order to scan that mobile drivers license. But again, another pro-consumer
bill that allows drivers when they're out and about if they forget their wallet,
they don't have their physical ID, they'd be able to present their mobile drivers license.
And again, over 450,000 Georgians already have their mobile drivers license.
This just ensures that if they interact with law enforcement, obviously they can present it.
And again, right now, if you go through TSA security at the airport, you can use your mobile
license. So we're just ensuring that opportunity expand the use of mobile drivers license.
And you said it's something that we may not see for a couple of years.
It'll take a while for it to be able to be something we can do in Georgia.
So the bill, as it's written, would any agency that already has a technology,
which a lot of agencies already do, they would accept it today.
But for some agencies, it need a little more time to get that technology by 2027.
They would have to accept it.
But you would start seeing by July 1 of this year, many agencies going ahead
and accepting mobile drivers licenses,
but I don't want to tell a driver
is don't worry about bringing your ID
if you have to get pulled over by the agency
that doesn't have that technology.
They were stuffed two years to get fully ready.
And that bill is in the Senate,
where is it in the Senate?
It's sitting in center rules
if we expect to vote here on Wednesday or Friday
and I believe we're gonna get that bill done this year.
Okay, we'll keep up with it.
We don't have a lot of time representative Barrett,
but do you have an education bill
that would speed up the process for IEP
your individualized education programs
for special needs, the students.
Can you talk about it really quickly?
You got 30 seconds.
Yeah, the Georgia special needs scholarship program.
It allows students with disabilities,
the ability to receive a state funded scholarship
to go to a private school that can better meet their needs.
There are more than 6,300 students
to take part in this program.
It's been out there since 2007.
This bill just makes a very good program,
a little more efficient, a little more family friendly.
Okay.
And thank you both for your bills that deal with consumers and families, I appreciate
that.
Thanks for being on the show after a long day.
So that does it for lawmakers today after a long day.
We don't have a show tomorrow.
The legislature will spend the day working on committees to get as much done as possible
before Sinney died on Friday.
Our show returns when they return to the Chambers on Wednesday and we'll see you then.
All until the end...
God bless you all...
