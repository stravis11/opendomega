TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good afternoon. We are going to begin our program. Welcome to the fourth annual
HBCU Heritage Day and I'm happy to introduce Ethel Johnson, Albany State
University graduate who is going to open up the program for us. Thank you
Senator Helpren. I have to move that mic back because my mouth is kind of
little big with an appropriate song for the HBCU heritage. Lift every voice and sing. Lift every
voice and sing, Till us and heaven ring, Ring with the harmonies of the liberty.
Let our rejoicing's rise as the liest,
Nene's guise, let it resound, loud as the road,
Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past had taught us.
Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us.
Facing the rising sun of our new day begun.
Let us march on till victory is won.
Thank you, let us please give another round of applause to our vocalist, Ethel Johnson.
Thank you very much for blessing us with your voice this afternoon.
Thank you to our Governor and First Lady, Kim.
The Lieutenant Governor I know is coming, Bert Jones, legislators of the Georgia General
assembly, presidents, and leaders of our HBCU colleges in Georgia represented here today
and to the many students and graduates of Georgia's HBCUs.
It is with great pleasure that I, I am Senator Sonia Halper, welcome you to the Georgia
State Capitol for our fourth annual HBCU Heritage Day.
Another thank you to Governor Kemp and First Lady Kemp for joining us here today and once
again presenting this celebration in partnership with my office.
Well Georgia is home to ten historically black colleges and universities, making us the
number two state in the nation tied with North Carolina for having the most HBCUs.
These institutions have played a vital role in our state's history and continue to shape
Georgia's future. The college's honor today are Savannah State University, Albany State
University, Fort Valley State University, Pain College in Augusta, Spellman College, Clark
Atlanta University, Morehouse College, Morehouse School of Medicine, Morris Brown and the Interdenominational
Theological Center. All ten of these schools have positively impacted the lives of nearly
20,000 students all together each year.
Generation after generation,
HBCUs play a vital role in elevating
students' socioeconomic status,
helping develop future business,
civic community, and faith leaders,
and have provided a proven pathway
to the middle class and beyond.
So whether it's a first generation college student,
like both of my parents were,
when they left Mississippi Farm Life,
for a world of new opportunities,
or one of the 76% of HBCU students
who are Pell Grant recipients,
or those second or third generation students
who are carrying the weight of family expectations,
HBCU's offer a welcoming environment,
and the support needed to succeed.
So today we are celebrating the rich heritage
and ongoing legacy of Georgia's HBCU's.
Please join me in welcoming my colleague, Senator Derek Mallow,
who will lead us in prayer, and I wonder, I see what we're
talking about.
Thank you, Senator Halburn, to our governor and first lady,
the elected representatives that are here today,
our HBC presidents, and all of you.
Thank you all for being here.
Disclaim as a Baptist preacher, I will give a brief prayer,
and I mean brief, I do mean brief.
So if you would pause and join me in a word of prayer,
most gracious to turn on all wise and all knowing God.
God, we thank you for a day that we have never seen
and a day that we will never see again.
Father, we thank you for each and every person
that thought it not robbery to assemble themselves here today
to celebrate the work that our HBCUs have done
in the state of Georgia.
Father, we just ask a special blessing upon our HBCUs
for we know that they have told the fields for many years
to help produce some of the most best and brightest
of our country and of our state.
God, we ask that you guide the leadership of this state
as they continue to make investments in our HBCUs.
God, guide the hands of our presidents
as they administer and oversee the operations
at those HBCUs.
And God, we just ask that you bless those
who have assembled themselves here today, father.
We ask that you give them traveling grace
and mercy on their way home.
God, we ask that as we leave this place,
it never be from your presence.
It is in the most wonderful matches,
name of the most high that we do pray.
Let our heart and mind say together, amen.
Next up, I am introducing the President,
Mary and Fedrick of Albany State University.
You might have seen that she was just,
we just learned recently that she will be leaving
Albany State University.
so we will miss her extraordinarily capable hands
in that institution, but she is coming to Atlanta
where she will be Senior Vice President.
Oh gosh, let me get this right.
At Georgia State University and Chief of Staff
to that President, Brian Blake.
And I believe for the first time,
we will have a Senior Advisor to the Chancellor's Office
in Dr. Frederick.
Welcome, welcome.
Thank you, and Senator, when you say it that way, it gets me nervous.
Good afternoon, everyone.
Senator Halperen, thank you for continuing to bring this event to the Capitol every year.
HBCU Heritage Day, I think this is the fourth annual HBCU Heritage Day, so thank you for that.
Governor Kim and Mrs. Kim, thank you for continuing to support our HBCUs.
Some amazing things have happened because of the support that you provided, so thank you so much for that.
I am Dr. Marion Ross-Fedrick, President of the Unsinkable and Indestructible Albany State University.
However, if the Flint keeps rising, we may be in some trouble, so hold on to us as the rain comes.
But we are here from Albany State University, the largest HBCU in the state of Georgia,
but also the most academically diverse institution with Associates, Bachelor's, and Master's degrees.
I get the wonderful opportunity today to actually introduce
a couple of the presidents that are with me and colleagues.
I'm just going to do two, correct?
Yes.
OK, so before I do introduce them, the governor's going to speak.
But I will say Dr. George French and Dr. Paul Jones.
Paul Jones is my colleague.
Dr. Paul Jones will come up and speak after the governor.
Thank you.
So, our governor really does not need any introduction.
We already know that he is a devoted husband, father, businessman, and a dedicated public
servant.
Over 35 years ago, he founded his first business, Camp Development and Construction Company,
with nothing but a pickup truck and a shovel.
look 30 years later, he leads Georgia as our governor and he remains an entrepreneur with
companies and investments in many different areas.
He has played a vital role in driving economic prosperity throughout communities across
Georgia and under his leadership, Georgia has achieved the remarkable feat of being ranked
number one in the country for business for an unprecedented 10 consecutive years.
Please join me in welcoming our Governor, Mr. Brian Kemp.
Well, thank you all very much.
Thank you Senator Halpern for that and for also just taking the time to organize this event
every year on behalf of our first lady, Marty Kemp,
we're excited to be with you for the fourth annual now
HBCU day at the Capitol, certainly an incredible opportunity
for us to celebrate all these proud institutions
have done and continue to do to enrich our state.
I know our Lieutenant Governor, Bert Jones, has arrived.
As you all know, this is a crazy, busy time
part of the session, so there's a lot of moving parts going
the Capitol and I appreciate you all bearing with all of us that are having to be
places and be on the floor and I know you'll hear from Lieutenant Governor Jones
in just a minute. I also just want to thank the other members of the General
Assembly that are here and that have supported this event in the past. You know
Senator Mallow when he was praying he left out the part about praying for a
swift and drama-free end to the legislative session. I may be more biased than others on
that part of the prayer. I appreciate Representative Patty Bentley and Representative Roger Bruce
and a lot of other folks that are here. We're so excited about Dr. Fredrick's new role.
I know she's going to keep Dr. Blake straight. That's exactly what I thought when I first
taught, heard the news, and I appreciate our esteemed presidents for allowing me to jump
in front of them because of our workload and other commitments that I have, but we're
very grateful for all that you all are doing.
Our nation's historically black colleges and universities have played an integral part
in shaping our economy, culture, and certainly an important part of Georgia's history.
Generations of Black Jordans and Americans have come to these campuses to pursue higher
education opportunities.
And for generations, these institutions served in many times as the only option for Black
Jordans and Americans seeking skills and knowledge for success.
Today, our HBCUs are the campus of choice for so many across our state, but also across
our country because of their rich legacy culture but also pathways to success. We are proud
Georgia has played such a large role in that legacy with graduates of our HBCU's going
on to become leaders not only in politics but business, the arts, STEM, religion and every
walk of American life.
Now I will just tell you, from my perspective as the governor, I hear weekly from corporations
and businesses in our state about the talent that we have in Georgia, but especially in
Atlanta.
And it's why major companies and corporations are coming to our state.
It's while they're not laying off folks.
They're coming here and growing even when their campuses and other parts of the state may
be downsizing and often here how big a part to HBCUs are to that workforce development.
That diverse talent that we have in our state is one reason we are doing so well just
right down the street.
And it's because of the hard work and faculty of Albany State, Clark Atlanta, Fort Valley
State, Morehouse, Morehouse School of Medicine, Pain College, Savannah State, Spillman, Inter-denominational
the illogical center and others that have empowered generations of black Americans to unlock doors
there were once closed to them and that is important work that they continue to do.
We are working to support them in that mission because we know that education is the key to an
individual success and by extension an success for our entire state. With Georgia continuing to
to welcome record economic growth
to all four corners of our state.
We need institutions like these
to keep preparing the next generation
so that they can take advantage of these opportunities.
That's why this year's budget proposal
included over $10 million for capital projects
at Fort Valley State and Albany State
in addition to the funding for all our public universities.
I was also proud of one of my administration's top priorities
And I want to thank the members of the General Assembly that worked so hard with us to get
this piece of legislation to fruition.
And that is the teacher pipeline package that passed a couple years ago.
It included a specific provision that requires our professional standards commission to work
closely with HBCUs to track greater numbers of minority teachers into this field.
It is important that all students can see themselves in their teachers.
And that measure helps make that a reality.
In closing, I look forward to continuing to work with the leaders and the students of
the HBCU's represented here today.
The local and state officials, especially those that are working in the gold dome that
have such great support for HBCU's like Senator Halperin, Senator Mallow, our Lieutenant
Governor Bert Jones, and many others.
But also our education leaders to keep celebrating and supporting our HBCU.
They do good work.
They help make Georgia the best place to live, work, and raise a family.
So thank you all for being here again this year.
It's been honor to be with you.
God bless.
Thank you again, thank you again, thank you again first lady as well
Okay, so now it is time to bring up two of our great presidents, President Jones, President
French, will you please join me at the podium.
We've got represented here Fort Valley State University who will talk to us about our
schools and of course Fort Valley is one of our public HBCUs.
He can tell you himself, but there's two land grant institutions in Georgia and Fort
Valley is our HBCU land grant institution established in 1895 that is just how
long they have been educating students. And then we've got President French who
of course is the illustrious president from Clark Atlanta University here in
Atlanta. Clark Atlanta has the distinction of being HBCU that offers both
undergraduate and graduate programs for its students and it is part of what
we colloquially and happily call the Atlanta University Center, Atlanta is the only place
in the nation that has the largest and oldest consortium of HBCUs in the country.
So it is a very unique asset that we have right here in the city just miles down the road
from this capital.
And anyway, welcome gentlemen.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Governor First Lady Camp, I know they have left Lieutenant Governor Jones, Senator
Halpern and other esteemed General Assembly members, good afternoon.
As we gather here today to celebrate HBCU Heritage Day, we stand at the intersection
of history and progress, reflecting on the profound support,
profound impact of historically black colleges and universities
in shaping our communities, our nation, and our world.
I'm deeply honored to address you on behalf
of Georgia's public HBCU's Albany State, Fort Valley State
and Savannah State University.
Along with my friend from Clark and Atlanta University
President French, as we affirm our commitment to excellence, equity, and empowerment.
HBCUs are not just institutions of higher learning.
They are beacons of hope, opportunity, and transformation.
They stand as a testament to the resilience, perseverance, and brilliance of excellence,
providing a nurturing environment where dreams take flight and futures are forged.
The economic impact of the public universities in Georgia is staggering,
totally more than $584 million.
These are figures, these figures, rather are not merely statistics,
they represent jobs created, business, businesses supported, and lives transformed.
And that's only the three public institutions I'm mentioning.
But our impact goes beyond dollars and cents.
HBCUs are pillars of their communities, fostering a culture of service,
leadership, and civic engagement.
We are catalyst for change,
excuse me, empowering our students to become agents of progress and
champions of justice.
Through partnerships and local businesses, government agencies, and nonprofit organizations,
we are driving workforce development initiatives that prepare our students for the challenges
of the 21st century economy.
So let us celebrate HBCU Heritage Day with pride and purpose, knowing that our journey
is far from finished.
Together, let us continue to build a world where every voice is heard, every dream realized,
and every life value.
Thank you, and may God bless our beloved HBCUs and the communities it serve.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Mr. President.
most certainly to the governor and first lady in absentia to our lieutenant governor and
friend lieutenant governor Bert Jones to senator Sonya Halper and all of your colleagues
who have worked audiosly to make this day a reality to the distinguished executive director
of Atlanta University Center Consortium, Dr. Michael Hodge, and to my colleagues, my colleagues,
the hardest working individuals in this nation without doubt, to my colleague, Dr. David Thomas,
the president of Morehouse College, to my colleague again, Dr. Paul Jones, president of Fort
Valley State University, and I'm going to skip over this one. I'm going to come back to that one
and intentional.
Madam President, congratulations on your new role
at Georgia State University.
We are proud of you.
I stand before you as President of Crockett Lanter
University, which had its origins in 1865.
And on the campus for which we originated,
we were fortunate because of a brotherhood
to give a campus for the establishment
of a phenomenal institution.
The institution would become Morris Brown College.
To be clear, we did not leave Morris Brown
when you started.
We had your back and we continued to have it
and we are proud of the work my brother
that you've done there.
Once you give my colleague a hand.
So what we want to celebrate today would be the work of the commission, the work of
the legislature, the work of the senator in putting together resources to continue to support
the HBCU's public and private within our state.
We ask for legislators, those representing legislatures to get behind Senator Halpern,
this effort and the efforts of all of our HBCU's representative Bruce.
We thank you so much Senator.
I want to make sure that we recognize, thank you again to our presidents.
We already heard from President Fedrick, President Jones, President French.
I want to also acknowledge President James, stand up, Morris Brown, President Thomas,
Morehouse College, and Dr. Valerie Montgomery Rice, I know, is coming.
She, of course, is the president of Morehouse School of Medicine.
When I invite Senator Mallow, I am going to let you, we're going to share the introduction
of our lieutenant governor because our colleagues, Jason Annapattar, as you know, the work that
we're doing on our HBCUs has been very bipartisan in nature.
There is a lot going on today, but you do your intro, and then I want to say a few words
two before you come out to lieutenant governor.
As the junior senator to the senior senator, I, of course, yield.
Our lieutenant governor, Bert Jones, is the 13th lieutenant governor.
He's father, husband, to our First Lady of the Senate, Miss Jan Jones.
Bert is also the president of the Senate, and he's our lieutenant governor.
So our first term is lieutenant governor, Mr. President, and those terms are interchangeable.
Lieutenant Governor has been a friend to HBCUs.
He has been very listening to our needs
and where he can help, he has helped.
And most recently to commission a study for veterinarian school,
he's been working to address some of the infrastructure needs
at Savannah State University.
I know for a fact he has been an inch ago
and some of the needs at Albany State University as well
on the center side and we're grateful to have someone
who will listen to our issues.
And he has not only come and listen.
He has also come and visited our HBCUs to see what we have to offer, to see the excellence
that takes place on our campuses and also to understand better the work that you all
do and that we do as an HBC alum each and every day and I cannot say thank you enough
for that work and I will now yield to the senator from Atlanta.
I am only co-signing on this to say that our lieutenant governors, we served together
since I've gone there. We had served together as senators. He does not have an HBCU himself
in his district. He served as a senator for 10 years, but has visited some of the Atlanta
ones. As we started talking about HBCU work, he asked great questions. He was very curious
about the work happening on these campuses, and together we decided that there was no better
way for him to better understand them, but to actually get in front of those schools.
So we did a tour last fall and visited with all of our schools.
And coming out of that, I've been really grateful for him for his support and some of the work
I'm doing.
I will name specifically, there is a piece of legislation.
The heat has, as Senator Mallow just said,
earnestly understood the needs and challenges
and has been working hand in hand with us
to try to identify ways that we might close
some of those gaps that he himself
was able to see with his own eyes.
So without further ado, our Lieutenant Governor,
hurt Jones.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
Thank you, everyone.
I appreciate Senator, that nice introduction.
and also my favorite senator from Savannah right there.
I enjoy Senator Mallow.
I thought he was a lawyer and I found a one lawyer
and I was like, surely he's a preacher.
The way he gets up in the whale and he's not a preacher either.
And I was like, what do you do for a living there?
Because you talk too good, you're too smooth to not be
one of those two.
He goes, I'm just a good salesman.
So lieutenant governor, so he does a great job
It's always a pleasure serving and doing work with Senator Halpring and what she's done
for HBCUs and what she's done to bring the HBCU initiative to the forefront.
And she came to us last year.
We're very fortunate here in the state of Georgia.
We have a lot of opportunities in this state and a lot of different realms whether we're
talking about in the medical field and the educational field and manufacturing, whatever
it is, we have a lot of opportunities. And when Senator Halperin came to me last year
and said, I want to do more to raise the profile of HBCUs, I said, I do too, you know, because
I want to do, I want every university and every technical college and every, every, every
educational entity we have to feel like they have a seat at the table and be a part of
making a difference in our what I call a workforce development. And when we were talking about
the HBCUs, both private and public, I said, you know, I'm a hands-on person. I really
like to get on the ground and see exactly what it is each university offers, what they do best,
what they want to be known for. And thankfully every president and made time for us to come,
I will have to say Dr. Fredrick's rolled out the red carpet down there at Albany State right there
I said they're gonna have a hard time topping this now because it was it was the bands were played and everything
But I did find out it was homecoming week that week, you know
So I thought it was just for me, but you know she was actually like it was all for me. I found out it's it was homecoming week
They were y'all play it were y'all playing Fort Valley and Columbus that week or something like that who was it?
that you'll have for home for, but yeah.
So anyways, but she had me for a little bit,
but if I had not gotten down there,
I wouldn't have seen the thriving campus population,
the need for us to do more student housing down there,
the curriculums that we need to focus on,
and I can assure you the governor was helpful in us
getting the money for us to do the remodel
on the Hot Tower facility, right?
believes and and so we were I was proud to do that I'm sad to see you go I'll
be honest with you but congratulations on on your new venture and I know you'll
do very well at Georgia State but had not had or not gone on those trips I
wouldn't have gotten to see whether marine biology program we had at Savannah
State University which is something we need to highlight as well as at Fort
Valley, the agricultural curriculum that we have there, which is the reason why I put
money in the budget this year, because we need another vet school in the state of Georgia.
We have one veterinarian school here in the state of Georgia, and I, Dr. Jones and I
talked about that on my trip there to Fort Valley, and I mean, we went in the meat coolers
and everything.
So we saw the agriculture end from start to finish and I appreciate Dr. Jones and I want
us to have that money there to put together that study and illustrate that we have a need
here in the state of Georgia and we have a good university entity that can fulfill that
need and we can go outside.
I know University of Georgia is only vet school for those of you who don't know, I think
and Fort Valley would be the perfect place
to have the second one here in the state of Georgia as well.
And of course, I had my trip to our
fine private institutions with Clark Atlanta,
Morehouse, and also Spellman as well.
And we've got money in the budget
for the academic center there as well
because I was, I could not believe
that in a campus of higher learning,
education that there was a lack of broadband and access there in the academic
center and so we're put money in that budget for that and I'm working with
Georgia Power for those you don't know and trying to get that implemented sooner
rather than later. So there are a lot of opportunities. Senator Halferin has
got a great mechanism that we passed out of the Senate that well it's a
commission that we set up that I plan on putting people who are HBCU graduates
that know the HBCU campuses and are proud graduates and people who will be
advocates for those for those universities and it is just another
mechanism we're putting in place that we'll be able to draw down federal
dollars will be able to take private contributions and it will really help our
state entities because not everybody is as unfortunate as Spellman and
Morehouse that had the large endowments schools like Savannah State, Port
Valley State and Albany State will benefit from from this program but it's
something that will be used for all our HBCUs so I will tell you this we have a
very exciting things lasting I'll leave you with and because I need your help
on this tomorrow we have a certificate of need bill that will be on the floor
And in that language, we have Morehouse College, we have Morehouse Medical School, the language
in there for them to be able to have the ability to take over the Atlanta Medical Center,
which would provide health care and also a training facility for Morehouse medical students.
So that's a big deal, that's a big deal.
That's language we worked on.
I'm meeting with the Morehouse Leadership
right after we get done here.
But that is something that is obviously
when that center closed, we lost our trauma,
you know, one of only two trauma centers
that we had here in the city.
And Atlanta's too big of a town in Metro,
Atlanta's too big of an area to have just one.
And this mechanism that we're putting in place right now
will enable us to do that.
So get on your house and send it members, all right?
y'all get on them, because CON has been something that has been a very difficult state bureaucratic
system that has been hard to break through, but this right here will benefit a lot of
people around the state.
It's going to benefit a lot of small counties as well, some large counties as well.
So thank y'all, thank you for your leadership.
I know I talked too long.
each and every one of y'all for your leadership your friendship and y'all know
y'all have a y'all have an open door with my office and y'all've got a friend
and lieutenant governor's office so thank y'all very much thank you thank you thank you again
lieutenant governor as you heard has been really fantastic it really trying to
address the needs that have been brought to his office and I think he is
very sincere about that open door. I don't think that we could have an HBCU
heritage day and let it be complete if we don't hear from a student. So I am
going to bring up a student, actually a graduate. I don't know the year that he
was a student at Morehouse, but I want to bring up representative Roger Bruce
who has served in the House for more years almost than I can count 32 years and has announced
his 22 and has announced his retirement so we will not see him back, we will not see
his name again on the ballot this year but he has served with great deliberation, thoughtfulness
and has made a difference and always, always, always has cared about our community.
So, Roger Bruce.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I was not scheduled to be on the program today, so I don't have a prepared speech, but
I want to thank the Senator for giving me a chance to come up and say thank you for
the education that I received at Moorhouse
and the Atlanta University Center, it's a family,
you know, as a student at Moorhouse,
you could take classes at any college in the center.
And I think I took classes at every one,
mostly Spellman, for obvious reasons,
but I also served on the board of ITC for 20 years.
And it is truly a family.
And you know, when you leave there, you are prepared.
They prepare you for the challenges that you face.
They prepared me to be down here
for 22 years serving the public.
And I want to talk long,
but I do want to share a story if I could.
I tried to get my son to go to Mo House.
You know this story.
I tried to get my son to go to Mo House.
He said, Dad, I don't want to go to my house.
I said, why not?
He said, because I want to have a good time,
and I don't want everybody calling you,
telling you what I'm doing.
I said, what are you going to be doing
that you don't want me to know about?
He said, whatever you did, I'm probably going to do that too.
And you didn't want anybody to know about it.
So I said, well, where you want to go?
He said, I want to go to Hampton.
I said, fine.
We drive up to Hampton.
I think we want campus 10 minutes.
And this guy walks up, he says,
Representative Bruce, how you doing, man?
I said, I'm good.
He said, I was in your class at Morehouse.
I said, what are you doing now?
He said, I'm the Dean of Students.
My son was about to have a heart attack.
It is one big family.
And I really appreciate, you know, letting me come up,
because I really want to say thank you
to all the presidents for the work that you do
and to let you know, I'm still in office
until the end of this year.
And I'm gonna do everything I can to do whatever I can,
now and in the future, to help you guys continue the legacy
of making sure that our children are prepared
for the struggles in this world.
God bless you guys.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay, well, we are closing out,
but I cannot close without,
because this is a celebration.
So let me just highlight some of the incredible achievements
by Georgia's HBCUs.
Did you know that Fort Valley State
is the number one university in Georgia for social mobility?
It is the number one ranked public HBCU in the state
and it boasts one of the largest solar farms
on a higher education campus in the entire nation.
That is our Fort Valley State University.
Savannah State University is the number one producer
of African American Marine Science graduates
in the country and it is our oldest public HBCU
at 134 years old.
Albany State University is the number one producer
of nursing associate degrees and registered
nursing associate degrees in the state of Georgia
and it is the only HBCU in the state
with a dental hygiene program.
Spellman College is the number one producer
of black women with PhDs in STEM in the entire country.
It is also the number one ranked HBCU in the country
for 17 years running and holds the spot
for the number ninth most innovative schools in the country.
Clark Atlanta University is the number two ranked
an oldest school of social work in our state.
And it is the only HBCU in the nation
with a cyber physical systems degree.
So think cyber security, AI, data analytics, and robotics.
That is our Clark Atlanta University.
Morehouse School of Medicine is the number one medical school
in the country for fulfilling the social mission
of medical education and 61% of graduates.
stay in Georgia upon graduation.
More House College, it's the number one producer,
a black men who go on to earn doctorate degrees.
It is also the largest men's liberal arts college
in the country, and it is the only HBCO CU
in the country dedicated to educating black men,
or men, but black men.
Pain College is a diverse and thriving campus
with students from all 50 states in the country
and students from around the globe.
And it generates 400 jobs locally and regionally
and 274 million dollars in lifetime earnings
for its graduates.
The Interdenominational Theological Center
was the first graduate level theological center
school to embrace Afrocentric, Hermann Nettics
as the core of its academic programs.
and it is the only United Negro College Fund member institution
that offers graduate level theological education.
Morris Brown.
Morris Brown just recently received its accreditation
after 20 years.
It is one of the few, is it the only still?
It is the only HBCU in the country
that has ever lost its accreditation to regain it.
And that has happened under the steady leadership
of Dr. Kevin James.
Our schools are thriving.
They are well regarded across the nation.
They are doing amazing work inside of our own state.
And ultimately, these institutions of higher learning
are terribly important to the overall ecosystem
in our state, whether we're talking
about economic development, workforce development,
their positions in the communities
and the access that they have throughout our state.
It is worth our time.
It is worth our effort to continue to put us a highlight
and a spotlight on these wonderful institutions.
And I thank you for celebrating with us again this year
our schools.
I will recognize Dr. Valerie Montgomery Rice,
more house school of medicine who has walked in.
Thank you for being here.
I want to thank you all for joining again today.
This concludes this part of our program.
We will be doing a moderated round table conversation.
Dr. Maria Boynton will moderate.
I believe that I will be talking along with,
let's see, who's else that's on the panel.
And are you going to?
OK, and Urban League is going to be on our panel.
and Dr. Fedrick is also on our panel.
That is gonna be in, oh gosh, 328 CLOB.
So we'll go back across the street there,
back to the club, but that's in 328.
Please join us if you can for that conversation.
Thank you again, please continue to be the folks
that always highlighting and always championing our HBCUs.
And like you've heard, there is a piece of legislation
that is making its way through the legislature.
It is in the House.
I was hoping it was gonna be heard today,
but our time got pushed back.
So it will be heard in the House on Monday.
And anything you can do to make sure
that people know how important it is,
that we invest in the schools,
but also in the communities in which they sit.
We strengthen the communities, we'll strengthen the schools.
So thank you very much for joining us.
I appreciate you being here.
Until next year, but don't be a stranger.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
