TRANSCRIPT
----------
You
We have a couple of people signed up to speak for this, and if you don't mind, I'll ask
Senator Robinson to offer a brief prayer.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Those who are comfortable with your head with me.
Afternoon, our Father in Heaven.
We thank you, Lord God, for the blessings you've given us today.
We thank you for the beautiful day you've given us, provided for us, Lord God.
And God, please remind us of the responsibility we have, Lord.
Continue to remind us as we move through this legislation, the impact that it has, Lord
God, not only on the individual's involved, but the citizens throughout this state.
And remind us, always, Lord God, to keep our minds open in our hearts.
We ask these things in the name of your Son, our Savior, our Lord Jesus Christ.
Amen.
Amen.
Thank you, Senator Robinson.
As I said earlier, we're going to have a hearing today and kind of get to the areas we
want to get to and deal with a static committee as well.
We might just move that one out so we can get that going.
I'm very, very interested in this Senate static committee because I think it's something
that we really need, so we can just sort of streamline this thing and take a lot of,
I think, unnecessary input into it after it's been adjudicated and filter through a lot
of committees and things like that, that way we can deal with it.
So, what I will do, what I will do, I'll go by the hearing first and then I go down
the list, we got four bills and we got one study committee and I'll start with the hearing
with input from, is this Clarence Harris?
Would you come up, sir, and sit like that,
we'll like to hear your comments.
Are you speaking on any one of the bills
we have here today, or generally?
Compensation bill is safe going to the meetings
for the other needs and the procedure.
All right, go ahead.
Yeah, some own claims here.
Generic.
And I'm George Johnson, project, first exottery.
I was exotterated in 2000 in Poe.
And I served on my 18 years in prison for a crime,
which I did not commit.
In 2005, I was awarded,
I was supposed to be awarded a million dollars
in which it was, at that time, they didn't know how to proceed to go forward with their
duties and things, which they awarded me a million dollars for a period of 20 years,
and they awarded to me 47,000 a year for 20 years, in which me just coming out of the
having no knowledge how to finish that ponds like that. It was very difficult
me and a lot of that. I was never able to keep my life together. And then on top of that
they turned right back around and I was text. I had to say the annuity to pay the
taxes off, you know, from the annuity which they gave them. I'm on this
salary and Georgia who was text. And after that happened, I ended up I got hit
by a car and we lived for dead and on the Saturday road
during the snowstorm and I ain't
about to pay for my own medical bill because I had no insurance.
So a little money that they gave me was going in for I even
realized.
But when we came up from a new other thing,
we tried to talk about the main thing that was important,
that would benefit to a medical.
to have tax, to be exempt from taxes,
and to have so secure to be on the pitch
to be established for the salary.
These was out there with the main thing
that we were all when they knew it came up.
When asked whether I feel like that state
will hold me, I said, well, I can't tell you,
I want to put a price on my life,
because I couldn't do that, you know,
because of what I went through.
I said, well, what I will ask you all to do
is to be fair.
That's the only thing to ask them to do it be fair.
But when nothing about the conversation with Fairbke,
there was no sick hug behind him.
You give me money, then you take it back by taxing me
and then you make it where I can't even deal with it.
One year up till the next is already coming.
And I hadn't enjoyed my life since I've been out.
And I'm not only speaking about myself,
but see there was five others,
a reason when they got out from the time that I got out who ended up getting certain
stipulations on how to go through drugs and all this, like they still locked up.
Then you got many help people that I rob a club, who's at their home listening thing,
Pete William's thing, John White, you know, all this other reason, George's stuff, don't
have no kind of gun upish now.
You see, he had their grant number news, like they should have, give us the amount of
mind that they told if you want to get it to me and knew it, why wouldn't it
a lifetime of new it? If you give me me a dollar, I'm entitled to the interest
on, you know, because you only gave me four or something thousand out, which is
five percent interest, that's the interest itself. Okay.
So I never touched the mind that you gave me. Okay, Mr. Harrison, what I'm going to do
and I didn't realize I thought you were going to talk the record about one of
these bills. What you're saying is very important. So what I'm going to have to do
is ask you to sort of stand off to a sit over to the side and I'll get back to
in a minute, but I have some bills I got to take care of.
Okay, I thought we'll talk about a secret room in New York.
I think you're talking about the structure of it.
Yes, I am.
It's been a judicator, so it's very important, trust me.
Okay.
And we'll listen to you.
But what I want to do is go in the order of my agenda right here, if you don't mind,
sir.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
If you stick around, I'll have you come back and say.
I'll be here.
Yes, sir.
Representative Houston, you come forward.
House Resolution Number Seven.
Thank you.
Yes, and I have, with me, Tiffany Roseville from Trentman's Pepper and Sanders, too.
Okay.
How to see like that.
Multiple, isn't it?
Thank you.
Thank you.
One of the reasons I'm here is that this Mr. Inman was from my district, and this crime
was committed in my district and I have been encouraged by constituents to bring this
resolution to you because so many people at home really feel terrible about the way
the man was treated and realize that he served 23 years of a crime he didn't commit.
And this bill has been gone through the claims advisory board and I'm sure you saw that
and they approved the payment of this
and recognized that he had been done wrong.
And like I told the committee and the floor of the house,
there's no amount of money that can compensate somebody
that went through what he went through.
And I'm sure you've read this,
and then Ms. Bruce will give you a few highlights of it.
But he, it's just a travesty that we had people
in our judicial system that did some of the things
to him that they did.
And I think she'll just give you some highlights
to the case, and I'd be glad to answer any questions.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
Go ahead.
Good afternoon.
Thank you all.
We'll identify yourself again soon.
Sure.
Tiffany Bracewell.
I'm a partner at Troutman, Pepper Hamilton Sanders,
just down the street.
I'm the firm and I have had the honor and pleasure
of representing Mr. Inman formally since early 2016.
And thank you again for the opportunity to be briefly heard here.
In boking a 2019 opinion that Justice Namias issued in Mr. Inman's case, we're here today
because everyone involved in our criminal justice system should dread the conviction and
incarceration of innocent people.
And that includes this esteemed body and the claims advisory board and other folks who
have taken a look at Mr. Inman's case.
I submit the Mr. Edmund's case as extraordinary, it's unique.
It is momentous and it's tragedy, not only for Mr. Inman, but for the ADEL community.
There were victims of other crimes carried out by the man that committed the offense for
which Mr. Inman ultimately was convicted.
And I believe the draft resolution before you outlines that well, but as quickly as I can
and cover 23 years of injustice.
I'll give you some quick facts, some evidence,
and then what the key courts in this state
have said about Mr. Inman's case.
In brief, Mr. Inman had just celebrated his 20th birthday
when he was hastily arrested for the murder
of Miss Donna Brown.
She was the night manager at the Taco Bell in Adele.
He was the new kid on the block.
He had been in Adele for a matter of weeks
when he was arrested.
The investigation and the trial were infected with constitutional deficiencies and misconduct
on a scale that, in my opinion, is pretty difficult to comprehend even today, kind of
most importantly, Mr. Inman's trial council pushed the district attorney and the GBI and
the ADEL police department to investigate a man named Hercules Brown, who had an alarming
history of unprovoked attacks, violent attacks in Adel around this time. Of note, Hercules
Brown worked with the victim at Taco Bell. He was one of the regular closers at the restaurant.
He knew how the night shift worked. He knew the closing procedures. He knew who would
be there at the end of the day.
Mr. Inman's Council and the District Attorney's Office received evidence to that effect. The
The DA's office and the GBI, for whatever reason, maybe chose not to believe it or chose
not to pursue it.
At least one witness had reported that Hercules Brown had solicited her and maybe other Taco Bell
employees to help carry out an inside robbery.
And at least three witnesses reported that Hercules Brown had confessed for whatever reason
that was not enough.
And to make matters worse, the GBI was permitted to testify that it had no information about
Hercules involvement in this offense, and that was
the lied by information in their own files.
There were no eyewitnesses in this case.
No one came forward that saw the crime occur.
There was no forensic evidence that connected
Mr. Inman to this crime.
His fingerprints were not a match to those found
at the scene or in the victim's car.
Law enforcement never located a gun.
There was forensic evidence that someone else committed this crime.
And years later, well after Mr. Inman's conviction
with advanced methods, DNA from the inside
of a homemade ski mask found in the victim's stolen car
came back to one person only, one in 18 quadrillion
to Hercules Brown.
There's no room or interpretation for error
that Hercules Brown wore that mask,
and he had good reason too, because he knew the victim.
Unfortunately, before the trial compounding these issues,
the prosecutor failed to disclose
that Hercules Brown had been arrested
with another homemade mask.
Just down the street from the Taco Bell
will also in possession of a gun and crack cocaine.
If you were to let me ask, just one,
sure.
Could you explain to me the atmosphere
that would require some matter to reveal something?
Is that ordinary procedure and the law setting?
Yes, so yes.
Of course, yes.
Of course, under the Constitution, the prosecution team
or the state is required to turn over information
that is favorable to the defendant.
And let's, if we can keep it as brief as you can,
I don't mean that.
It's very, very important.
What I'm getting at, can you address also, what
about the process that we had involved in right now?
I think you mentioned something about it.
Can you give us some insight on that,
what your perspective is?
Absolutely.
So echoing representative Hausten's remarks,
I think in February, the claims advisory board
kind of made its own extraordinary statement in this case,
they recognized the evidence of innocence
in Mr. Inman's case, and they unanimously approved
the claim for payment.
My understanding is that has never happened before,
in the case of an exonery, they did so without qualification
and deferred to the General Assembly
to compensate Mr. Inman.
I'm sure some of the folks here in the audience
have more experience with exonries over the years
comparatively.
But it's been a multi-step process.
We started with the claims advisory board.
We've worked through various hearings,
and here we are.
Mr. Inman believes, and consistent with other exonries,
has sought a standard amount of compensation
per year for which he was wrongfully imprisoned.
but total is 1.61 million for the 23 years
he spent in prison related to this case.
Okay, members of the committee comments.
Question of some of the robbing soon
and then some of the kind of robbing soon.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Ma'am, the not of the murder
were there witnesses near the crime
that reported seeing the vehicle flee the scene?
Yeah, so the state had essentially, all the witnesses
in the case except for one, recanted their testimony
either before or at trial, not decades later,
as we commonly see in these cases,
with the exception of one witness,
a state's witness who testified she saw,
she came forward a month after the crime occurred,
after an award had been announced,
which she ultimately received.
She reported seeing a vehicle speed away from the scene.
So did not see the murder occur,
or the weapon or anything like that.
So the short answer is yes.
There was some people who claimed to have seen individuals
and two individuals standing on the corner, I believe,
and it was late at night.
It was two in the morning, sir.
And the vehicle they were fleeing in,
was that the victim's vehicle?
It was the victim's vehicle.
And the victim's vehicle, is that where the ski mask
was recovered from much later?
It was the ADL police department failed to collect it
and it was recovered.
Right, I think we're saying the same thing.
I mean, I'm not trying to trap you, I promise.
But it was much later, the ski mask was recovered
from that vehicle.
Yes.
And that's the ski mask that was tested
and the DNA came back to the individual Hercules Brown.
Not related to that.
Who later assaulted the individuals at the convenience store
or the general store.
Yes.
In a brutal daytime murder, right, right?
OK.
Now, Mr. Inman, when he was released,
how was he released from prison?
I'm thinking, and I'm trying to go back to my notes.
A habeas was granted by the judge in the Superior Court.
That's correct.
OK.
And so the habeas sent it back to the prosecutor, correct?
Yes.
And what was the basis of the court
sending it back to the prosecutor?
But that's the procedure because the prosecutor has to decide on whether to move forward with
a new trial or not.
Right.
Because of the DNA.
No, it was on the totality of the evidence, including the withheld evidence from the
prosecutor.
Right.
So it would have been the prosecutor's decision, was this the same district attorney when
it was sent back?
No, it was not.
That was my nephew.
It was that bad.
Okay.
And he chose not to prosecute the case, correct?
That's correct.
Okay, and was the prior prosecutor, was that individual charged with any prosecutorial
misconduct?
No, we were three steps removed if you include the current district attorney.
Yes, ma'am.
And so that prosecutor just lost an election, I guess, and moved on?
No, he was appointed to a judgeship.
Okay, thank you, ma'am.
Sorry.
Any more comments?
I'm sorry.
And the first district attorney ended up going to prison, the district attorney that
withheld evidence ended up going to prison, but not for this trial, not because of this,
but in another instance he ended up serving time.
Later on, my nephew was a DA who is now sentenced as a spiritual judge.
So it was your nephew that chose not to prosecute the case?
The second time around.
Okay, thank you.
So, Mr. Studsdale, District Attorney Studsdale.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, okay.
What about the first time around?
I can't remember.
I'm not sure what you mean by the first time around.
This is just a strange one.
One thing that bothered me so much is that the withheld evidence and then the GBI agent line.
Well, and I'm not going to step into that.
I got some information on that and I've been told that information is incorrect.
about somebody lying because perjury is a crime in Georgia.
Well, you might not know more about it,
but when I've understand people down there,
this man was not guilty.
And I don't know what the...
I don't think you would have brought this
if you thought he was guilty.
I don't think you would.
And I don't know if we,
the only information I've got is talking to the DA.
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Comments by the members of the committee.
All right, we thank you for the input.
And we, like I said, this is a hearing only today.
but we will take action and look at it next week.
And one of the bills, all of the bills will be up for
a vote or consideration at that time, okay?
Okay.
Thank you.
I want to say, when you're having the study community,
we need to do something to these people
who do things wrong like withhold an evidence.
They need to be punished somewhere, right?
We have a prosecutorial,
Mr. P.
The floor, Mr.
Biel and the House right now in Judy Non-Sevil and if you'll reach out to the committee and tell them to pass Senator Robertson's legislation we'll do something about
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for your time.
Thank you very much for your time.
Thank you for your time.
And it's in Judy.
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
This time, Representative House Resolution 55, Representative Buckner.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I also have a couple of people that are here.
I did that one.
Come on up.
I'm sorry.
I'll get back on schedule in a minute.
I'm sorry.
Do you need to...
Go ahead and sit down.
This is Claire Gilbert and Chief Deckmar.
Chief Mars, a police chief that is from LaGrange, Georgia, where this happened back in the 80s.
What I would like to do is just kind of give you an overview.
I was drawn into a new district as many of us were drawn, and I was invited to come into the LaGrange troop county area.
And when I got there, I learned about this.
and was asked to carry this compensation resolution on behalf of Mr. Terry
Talley of LeGrange, who was falsely accused, wrongfully convicted of sexual assault.
He served almost 26 years until he was exonerated and released from prison and
although he had always maintained his innocence. His exoneration came
following a re-investigation by the police district attorney and the judicial
circuit there. There were in this re-investigation, they learned that there was unreliable witnesses
in testimony, biological and physical evidence had been lost or destroyed before and after
the trial. And there was withholding of information. But the most important thing is that the
the DNA evidence that was used did not match the DNA of
Mr. Terry. Following the re in investigating of the cases and
the DNA that had proved that Mr. Talley was not the person
that did the some sexual assaults. He was exonerated for the
25 years, 9.7 months that he had served. We're here today
because the legal system has demonstrated his innocence.
It's extraordinarily difficult to be exonerated.
And he was exonerated.
He was released from prison.
And he currently works for the city of the Grange
and the animal services unit.
I'm not certain what else you'd like to know at this point,
but I'll be glad to answer your question.
Just your input and your opinion about,
especially about the process we're going through here
and give us an idea of what your thinking is about.
Once you are, the steps of being exonerated
and coming before this committee or the appropriation committee
and all of the steps you built through in that context,
a brief sum of options of what you think about it.
Well, I'm very much in favor of the bill
that I hope you'll hear in a little while
that is HV364.
I have worked with fellow delegation members
on that bill several times we've introduced it.
I feel very strongly that this is a process
we should go through and as with as little politics as possible and have people that know
about evidence, evidentiary, I have trouble with that word, processes and that it needs
to be in a commission.
But since we don't have that commission, this this gentleman is a in his own words a
a simple-minded man that has a limited education.
He has served time for something.
He continually said he was not guilty of.
It was proved that he was not guilty of it.
He was exonerated.
He's been released.
And I think the state did him an injustice
by incarcerating him, those $25.
You're aware of a house bill, $364.
This is a bill that we're looking
at the wrongful conviction compensation review panel,
We're trying to get set up.
That's the one I mentioned.
I'm in favor.
That's what, okay.
We really, I think that, that stream line, the process, we need to get as many legal people
that tell us, give us a put on it and whether we move forward with it or not, but any members
of the committee?
Yes.
Senator Robinson.
Senator Robinson.
I want to thank my delegation member for coming forward and my instructor from the
at Command College, Chief Lou Deckmar,
whose hair was a lot darker when he was my instructor.
So it was mine, I do wanna thank y'all for coming for it.
And to talk about briefly the legislation
that you were discussing on 364,
I also have a bill over in legislative counsel
that I agree with you 100% I think that we need
to come up with a product that does take this
out of the hands of the General Assembly.
Now, to Mr. Talley's case, you mentioned several times
that he'd been exonerated.
I just want to be clear, and of course, Chief,
I know you're very familiar with the case.
The DNA cleared Mr. Talley of one of the cases
that he was sentenced to prison force, that correct.
And I'll call that, and Chief, I know you
know from your intimate involvement in this process,
He was exonerated from case number 969, I believe.
But he also had convictions in case number 972, 973, 974.
And I believe case 970, and speaking to the district attorney there in that circuit,
Mr. transfer, there was some concerns saying that though that he was
It's honored for DNA, based on the DNA from that one particular case.
That was not the case in the other cases, and the district attorney still strongly
fills that Mr. Talley was guilty of involvement in those other cases.
And I know at one point there was a testimony that the DNA could possibly belong to another
individual, and a search warrant was conducted, and that individual submitted DNA and was
also cleared of the sexual assault, and that the information that led to Mr. Talley having
contact with law enforcement to begin with was Mr. Talley encouraging or attempting to
force a young lady near or on the campus of the Grange College and that she's the one
that called 911 when Mr. Talley left the scene and later came back and said he was only
joking and this kind of stuff and kind of got him involved in this net where he became
and a suspect in multiple sexual assaults
occurring in the jurisdiction if I'm correct.
Is that right?
Close.
Close.
The incident that brought him to the attention
of the police actually occurred
away from the college at a residence
where I think he had been raking
or doing some yard work.
Had heard that a woman was offering sex for money.
He went to that residence, showed her the money.
She kind of waved him away and he took off.
And that's what brought them to the tension.
But I would also like to make one correction.
He didn't serve 26 years.
He served 40 years.
And there was an extraordinary motion that was brought jointly,
I believe, by the Innocence Project and the District
Attorney's Office that set aside the sentence
and allowed him to be released.
So with regard to the exoneration, you're correct.
It was the one that was based on DNA.
But to your point, Mr. Chair, the Senator and I,
Senator Robertson, I have been talking about this case
for two years, and I want to thank you for one of the concerns
we had was just the logistical gymnastics you have to go
through in order to get wrongful convictions addressed
in a way that compensates those that have suffered
from that wrongful conviction.
So thank you for that, sir.
The issue that concerns me just real quickly background, I just retired 50 years, 32 years
as a police chief.
This came to our attention in 2008 when the Innocence Project contacted us and said that
they believe that Mr. Talley was innocent.
We said we'll work with you to get a buckle swab, sent a detective down there.
He got a buckle swab.
That was 2008.
There wasn't a finding for the DNA, which exonerated him from the only case where there
was DNA available.
That occurred in 2012, and that conviction was set aside.
Based on the information that I had, I was concerned about the nature of the investigation.
I signed a sergeant to reopen those cases.
And it took him from 2004 until 2012 to 2017 to get enough information.
And this is one of the issues that's a share that you talked about is evidence and how
it's handled here.
We had evidence at the PD, at the Sheriff's Office, at GVI, the court reporter archives.
There needs to be legislation that addresses where the evidence goes.
It should be warehouse and a central location.
in their dog had the evidence. And so as a result, evidence is lost, evidence is misplaced,
evidence is destroyed, and as a consequence, the only physical evidence we had was for
that one case. So that would be a recommendation that I would make is that on any serious felony
case, there be a central depository where all the evidence goes. It's not farmed out
to, you know, various folks that are involved in the case.
So, so when you're doing it, if I may, she's, so when the active investigation is, you
don't share with the sheriff department, it's not some kind of data center that houses
all of this until the case is finalized or something.
It depends on the role.
When you have a multi-jurisdictional investigation, the detective taking that evidence is going
to follow the protocol for their agency.
So if GBI is handling one aspect of the case, and they get evidence, it goes to GBI.
If the sheriff's off, in this case, we had an envelope that was found on one of the college
students windshield.
And that was processed for prints, Mr. Talley's prints were not on that envelope.
But the sheriff's, it was turned over to the sheriff's office.
So now they've got that evidence.
And so to say that it's a bit chaotic in terms of how that evidence is handled would be
an understatement and would, I think, be a right opportunity for the state to come in
and have central depositories or give GBI the room in their evidence component to take
all that evidence and hold it.
I don't know what, but I really thought we'd already did that, and I really did.
I thought.
for you talking at the conclusion of the case.
Yes.
Okay.
As it's entered as exhibits in the court, and it becomes part of that court record, when
that case is over, it ought to go somewhere where it's all together.
Along with the chain of custody of each piece of evidence that has been picked up along
the way that can all be tied into a neat bow if it we ever end up in one of these hearings
like this so that we could show how all the pieces came to this one conclusion.
Yes sir, more important than that is technology evolves and you want to analyze that evidence
you can get your hands on it.
So in this case, you're dealing with one case
and there were some other peripheral cases
that may or may not have involved him.
Well, he was just one that we're dealing with
and that's what the exonerated.
It was all of them.
See, the working theory of the police chief
at that time was this was a serial rapist.
And when Mr. Talley was taken into custody,
they put all those individual cases together
and those are the cases that he was ultimately convicted on.
There was evidence that was not admitted.
Exculpatory evidence, for example,
one of the witnesses was a Senator Roberts
and will understand the significance of this.
One of the witnesses had a blood alcohol of over 0.3
and she made an identification based on voice.
And her alcohol limit was what, four times,
what the legal limit is to operate a vehicle.
There was gloves that were identified belonging
to that alternative suspect at the scene.
Those were never recovered.
There were a host of issues that,
when the two sergeants got done investigating this
from 2012 to 2021, they came to me and said,
and said, and these are not liberal individuals here.
These are folks that have been doing this 15, 25 years.
They came to me and said, I don't know how they pulled
probable cause for a warrant let alone convicted them.
I think this was a case where heightened concern
in the community, a serial rapist.
There arguably may have been some racial components in it.
But the fact is that it was a time where when you look at
the evidence, you're curious as to why these convictions occurred.
Okay.
Nice one, quick.
Yes, sir.
Chief, did he plead any of these cases?
He had a one-day trial, and that included two one-day trial.
He had one day trial was convicted, refused to plead, had another one-day trial, jury
trial, refused to plead, and then after he was convicted back-to-back, he pled.
He played to the last three charges.
Was it five sexual assaults?
There were a total of six.
Six, yeah.
Oh.
There were a total of seven separate charges.
So my name is Claire Gilbert.
I am the former executive director of the Georgia
Innocence Project.
I would see executive director for six and a half years.
Can you speak up closer to you so we...
I would see executive director for six and a half years
and oversaw GIP's work in the latter years
with the Lagrange Police Department on the Terry Talley case.
And so he did end up serving 40 years
and went to trial on two back-to-back, one-day trials
on serious, very serious assaults, sexual assaults,
was found guilty.
They both drew from the same jury pool.
He received two life sentences plus 10 years back
to pack each day and then was encouraged by his attorney and his family and he was completely
distraught over the fact that he had been found guilty though innocent on these two cases
and ended up taking a plea on the remaining charges.
He on one in the one case, one of the two cases that he went to trial on is the only one
where the Georgia Innocence Project or the Lagrange Police
Department was able to find any physical evidence whatsoever.
That evidence was tested and definitively
proved Mr. Talley's innocence on that case.
And then over the years, there was the reinvestigation
that Chief Decmar talked about, some by GIP,
some by the police department, some cooperating with each other.
That is where information came out about the,
for example, the blood alcohol concentration of 0.34
in one of the cases that was never disclosed
to the defense, the fact that witnesses had identified
an alternate suspect was not disclosed to the defense,
the fact that an alternate suspect had been developed
and gloves matching that suspect identified
as that suspect's gloves was never disclosed to the defense.
So there were a series of problems in these cases.
In Mr. Talley admitted to one of the crimes.
And he had always admitted to one of them.
And that was the first one that you discussed
Senator Robertson.
That was what we referred to as the botched attempt
to pay for sex.
That case was never the claimant in that case
did not come forward until about four months
after the incident had occurred.
She did not call the police at the time
that the incident occurred.
And it was after all of this was in the news.
And she saw Mr. Talley again in the community
that she came forward about it.
Mr. Talley is not seeking compensation for that case
or for another case that the DA chose not to exonerate him on.
He was exonerated on four separate cases.
One of those had DNA evidence of innocence which enabled pulling the thread to show the
severe flaws and lack of evidence in the other four cases.
Those all four were with agreement with the Lagrange Police Department and we have a letter
here that I will distribute that Chief Deckmar wrote in support of Mr. Talley on behalf of
the Greenwich police department. Those four cases were exonerated. The DA chose to have
one and then two were not. Those convictions were not vacated and they remained on his
record. However, Mr. Talley is not seeking any compensation for those cases or for the
time that he served on those cases, only the ones that he was exonerated on. And finally,
I just want to add in terms of the nature of a plea that as executive director of the
Georgia Innocence Project for years, I certainly learned about the fact that roughly 95
to 97% of cases resolved in police,
people who are prone to influence and suggestion,
like Mr. Talley, who the highest grade he graduated from
was sixth grade in school,
may be more subject to pressure to take, please.
And here, in this case, he fought hard,
two separate cases, trial to trial,
and they vacated those convictions.
they convicted him despite the fact that he was innocent
and those were vacated as well.
So I would just, and I would also note that the fact
that someone has pled guilty does not prohibit their convictions
from being vacated or them from receiving compensation.
One in over, one in 10 DNA exoneration cases
involved a guilty plea across the nation.
And just last year, Mr. Dennis Perry was exonerated
by the legislature in the amount of $1.2 million
for his wrongful conviction despite that he had waived
his right to appeal in order to avoid the death penalty.
Members of the committee in the comments, questions.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate you inputting your comments.
If I may say one very other brief thing related to your first questions.
We are strong supporters of House Bill 364.
We believe it's extremely important to have a reliable, predictable, objective process
that these cases can go through.
Take the leg switch out of it.
Correct.
Have a quick question.
Ma'am.
How's the Georgia Innocence Project funded?
The Georgia Innocence Project Fund is funded largely by donors, private foundations, thousands
and thousands of individual donors.
It's a 501C3 nonprofit.
There are two federal grants to work with conviction integrity units, but that's generally
the basis of them.
Thank you.
I appreciate that.
And that brings up another point.
It is so cumbersome when there's exculpatory evidence that somebody that's been in prison
And now you get evidence that maybe they're not guilty.
And right now, it's a nonprofit that's carrying that banner.
And there needs to be some mechanism.
In fact, this case, I presented to the Georgia Chiefs
and also to the Commission on Accreditation
for Law Enforcement Agencies.
And as a result, they adopted standards for law enforcement
that if there's post-conviction,
exculpatory evidence, then law enforcement
has to have a process to handle that.
We shouldn't be circling the wagons
and creating obstacles to getting folks
that ought not be in prison out of prison.
Chief, to that, don't you?
We're talking about a case is there for 40 years.
It's obvious that some of the rate kits
were not sent to the GBI or missing.
So in the perfect world would we hold on
to this evidence for 40 years somewhere?
And that gets to my recommendation
of some central, which means there needs to be some big
warehouses.
And I'm thinking Senator Robertson, that's a good point.
I'm not even sure you have to maintain all that physical
evidence.
You take, you know, swatches or samples of it and then
preserve it.
Because as you know, we've gotten DNA off of a small piece
of clothing 20 years later.
It's just a recognition that, you know, there may be
as technology advances.
But I think we're solving more cases now by people trying
figure out their genealogy than anything else sadly so but I do want to
point out that the information the testimony of the district attorney in the
district does differ then you know like the and I think you reference that to
the botched attempt to pay for sex where Tally grabbed her by the arm and pushed
her back inside the front door and tried to close the front door and they got
to a struggle and she got away from him, said the Asian female who identified Tally as
the person who attempted to grab her.
And so, I mean, there's always going to be those differences.
So we need to make sure through the process because it's a lot clearer when we have all
of the evidence.
Right.
And the thing with Mr. Tally and that we have these, this one case where obviously he didn't
do it, the suspect that they created obviously didn't do this either for basing it, put
in the same amount of weight on the DA in both of those cases,
but then we have all these other cases.
And some of those, like you said,
where he is not seeking compensation on,
but did what's convicted on.
And so, you know, all of that comes together
and tries to give us the reason to do or not do
which are our attempt.
And so that's the other thing, isn't it?
In that one case, the botched attempt to pay for sex
was initially charged as a misdemeanor.
And then it got conflated with all of these other charges
to a felony.
And in the other case that he ended up also pleading on
and that we're not seeking compensation on,
he has always maintained his innocence.
And he still maintains his innocence on that one.
That is just, he was given a choice
whether he would accept exoneration and immediate freedom
on the other four cases, or he could have stayed in
and continue to fight.
The real weighty issues we've got to move on,
but a comment from Senator C.
Please.
Yeah, I just want to thank you all for your service.
I tell you, it's tough to listen to folk who are innocent
and having to go through years of incarceration
at the dime, but it is hard to listen to that.
And I'm just hoping at some point,
and I've been listening to it for 20 years now.
and it doesn't get any easier,
and we've compensated several folks,
but you can't buy back your life.
You just can't do it.
That's all, Mr. Chairman.
Right, thank you.
Thank you for your comments,
and like I said, we'll look at next week,
we'll have another hearing,
and another meeting at the time.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you.
Representative Evans,
we're apologized,
but these comments get pretty.
That's good to have a time, man.
Yeah, it needs a whole new session, don't worry.
Thank you for your time and your patience.
No, thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.
And I have two, but they're related.
And so if it's okay with the chairman,
I'll just talk about it together.
Yes.
So how's for us?
You're going to do it three, six, four, first.
I'm sorry, 48 and 49.
48 and 49.
Yes, go right, yes.
Yes, Mr. Chairman, House Resolution 48,
which seeks to compensate Michael Stinchcomb and House
Resolution 49, which seeks to compensate Michael Wolfolk.
They were co-defendants in the same case.
Code defense.
Yes.
And they both served 18 years for a crime
that they did not commit.
They were the first individuals
exonerated by the Fulton County Conviction
Integrity Unit.
They shot in self-defense.
They had maintained that from the very beginning.
At all times, in this case, the physical evidence
supported that they had acted in self-defense.
The conviction happened really with the help of one
eyewitness testimony who did not have great vantage point
for what happened that day and had been inconsistent
in their story several times.
But nonetheless, it happened the best eyewitness
to see what happened was actually in the car
with the person who ultimately was shot
and was in his deceased was sitting in the car
with that person.
That eyewitness was thought to be dead for a number of years.
The prosecution found out that this person was not dead.
Only a few years after the convictions happened,
never brought that to the attention of the defendants
or their counsel.
But luckily, those defendants were
able to find that person on their own later.
And that person's testimony, which
was consistent with self-defense,
is what ultimately led to the grant of the new trial
and the ultimate null process,
which was the exoneration here.
But very briefly, the gentleman were in a house.
There was a woman, the lady who died.
She was shooting at these men in the house.
They were ducking and trying to find cover within the home,
but they were not able to do so,
because she was shooting through the window.
So they grabbed a gun to shoot back in self-defense.
And one of the bullets ultimately hit the driver of the car
and I think she was passenger of the car,
but that's how it happened.
Self-defense from the beginning,
backed up by I witnessed testimony
that unfortunately it took too long to find.
And these men, just like anybody who serves time
in the prime of their life, you know, missed out on their
best earning years, missing kids grow up,
missbearing loved ones.
And while we can't fully compensate them
for what happened, we asked for compensation
that's in line with what this general assembly
has done in years past.
And appreciate your consideration.
Thank you.
Any comments, Senator Robinson again?
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
Now, you said was she the driver of the passenger?
She was the passenger.
OK, and so she was shooting at the Elm in the house?
Yes.
Any reason as to why she was shooting at them that we know of?
I think they were in a fight.
She was in a fight with one of them.
It's a domestic type situation then?
Yes.
OK.
And the eye witness that was later found,
did that person give a statement at the time of the death?
No, they were thought that the driver,
he was thought to be dead.
At the time that Mr. Stinchcom and Mr. Wolfhoek
were going through their trial, he
was only located years later.
So he never testified in the original.
So he was never witnessed, never spoke to police
until he testified in the later trial for the exoneration?
Yes.
Yeah, there was, there ultimately they won their motion
for a new trial from the Georgia Supreme Court
after talking about the availability of this new witness.
And then the Fulton County District Attorney's Office
ultimately did a null process
so they didn't move forward with the new trial
because the evidence wasn't there.
So when did the prosecutor become aware of this witness?
We believe as early as 2009,
which was only about four years after.
And who made them aware of this eyewitness?
Was it the defendants?
No, he became known to the Fulton County District Attorney's Office
because he was an eyewitness in other cases for them.
He's an expert eyewitness, is what we like to call him.
He's trying to, yes, thank you.
Comments, questions, thank you very much.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Appreciate your time.
Appreciate your patience.
Thank you.
Next, Representative Hokeham.
Thank you for your patience.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.
It's my pleasure to speak with you about House Bill 364.
As just a little bit of background, I am a former prosecutor.
And the first time that I was asked to work on one of these issues was last year.
I worked on a resolution for Mr. Kerry Robinson, which Senator Beach then carried in the
Senate, and to be candid with you when I was first asked about it, I did not immediately
jump at the chance to help.
My own biases, I assume that people that went to jail were in fact guilty, and I had
to work through that.
And one of the things that I've thought about a lot since becoming involved in this
is there is no human institution on this planet that is perfect every single time.
And our juries are a very good system.
They work very hard, but they are not perfect, and they do not have a perfect record.
So it is very important for us to have this possibility of compensation for individuals.
And you've heard some of the harm already, I'll touch on it very briefly, besides just
their liberty being taken when it should not have been, one's health is greatly diminished
if you spend time in prison.
who spends time in prison, you have a shorter life expectancy than everybody else.
They are not able to invest in their skills and in their careers and often they are spending
time in jail during the years when they should most be working.
That means that they're not contributing to social security.
That means that they're not contributing to Medicare.
And so when they come out, they don't have access to the services that are available
to everybody else who wasn't put in the same position.
So what are we trying to do with House Bill 364?
I'll give you an overview and then I can go through any
of the specifics.
What it does is it effectively would end this process.
I heard from many members in the House and you all may feel
the same now that this is a really hard decision to make.
And many legislatures do not really feel like they have
the background, the understanding, and the information to make these decisions.
So what is proposed in House Bill 364, which is a bipartisan bill, and it might be helpful just
to provide a little bit of context. This is not in any way, shape or form, a partisan bill.
It was initially worked on by now leader's abstraction. He started on it last year before.
He was promoted to become the majority leader. He worked on it, drafted it, and then asked me to
carry it because he had a lot on his plate and it was able to pass the House last year.
There were some questions in the Senate and to be fair, there were some issues that were
unresolved at that time.
But over the last year we've worked to address some of those unresolved questions and specifically
what those were was the Supreme Court had weighed in last year informally and it said that
they had a little bit of concerns in terms of the separation of powers issue.
Those have all been resolved and what we have done is we have set up the bill so that
is an administrative function where if there is a recommendation for compensation it would
be a recommendation to the Chief Justice to then put it into the Judicial Council's budget.
It is not the legislature directing what the Judiciary does and instead it is directing
an administrative function of putting a line item in the budget.
So what this bill would do is as you've heard the existing process requires an individual
file claim against the state, that claim goes to the claims advisory board which is administratively
attached to the Secretary of State. Those individuals don't have the expertise to really evaluate
these claims either. You heard that there was one individual that they recommended have a compensation,
have their compensation be approved, generally what they do if they deny the claim.
They may still say in their write-up in their recommendation that we believe the person is innocent
and there's compelling information as to the person being innocent.
But they generally deny the claim because the claim may be against the Department of Corrections
and the Department of Corrections didn't actually do anything wrong.
They were provided with an inmate, they housed the inmate, cared for the inmate,
and then they released the inmate.
So we have this claims advisory board which is not really well suited to make these decisions.
So what this would do is we'd keep the claims advisory board but then underneath it
And the Meadeville starts on Section 4 on page 3
is this first, and this is really, really important.
This only applies to the innocent.
This is not for individuals that were released
on a technicality.
This is not for people that committed crimes.
And for whatever reason are being released,
this is for people who are innocent.
So that category of individual who did not commit the crime,
but for whom their liberty was taken from them.
So part four on page three outlines that,
this has been reviewed by the prosecutors
to make sure that it's tight
and that we're only covering innocence.
And then we would set up a panel.
The panel, and certainly if the Senate has different views
on how to do this, we're all ears.
But this is what we tried to do.
You'll see on line 71, a judge,
retired judge or retired justice.
The retired judge or retired justice,
that was a recommendation from the Supreme Court
to broaden the pool of individuals.
As you all know, we have former Chief Justice Namios,
we have former other members of the Supreme Court
who potentially serve in this capacity.
They would serve on it.
So we'd have that expertise of having a judicial officer
who could make sure that this person is actually innocent.
You would have a district attorney to represent the prosecutors.
you would have a criminal defense attorney.
And then since most of the exonerations concern DNA,
you'll see that the appointments from the House
representatives and the Senate would be individuals
that have that expertise, expertise in forensics,
so that way they could help, because that is usually
the basis by which people are exonerated.
The panel would be able to promulgate rules and regulations
and develop forms, et cetera.
The bill also carves out one of the things that you've heard in the testimonies relating
to the others.
Sometimes there are other crimes that take place that perhaps the individual did, but
they are convicted of something that they didn't do.
They cannot be compensated for those crimes and there is a carve out for compensation
for them to satisfy the sentences related to those other crimes if that is in fact what
took place and then the amount for the bill is this panel would review the evidence make
a recommendation and then the amounts which is on page seven we did a survey of all the
states and my understanding is that 38 states have a process by which they have an independent
board similar to this make these decisions instead of them coming through their general
assembly. So Georgia is a minority state right now as not having one of these processes.
The average across the country is about 75,000. In real dollars, it may sound like a lot,
but if you really take a step back and ask, would you take the deal of 10 years, 15 years,
20 years in prison for 75,000? Nobody on this planet would take that deal. But this puts
within the board a range between 50 and 100,000 recognizing
that the midpoint is that national average.
But it provides some flexibility.
So if the board believes that an individual should have
a lower amount and let's just say that that individual did not
have much in terms of work experience,
whereas perhaps somebody like me might be more towards the
higher end of the scale if I was wrongfully convicted.
So it gives a little bit of flexibility.
There was debate about whether to set it as a flat fee
or a set figure or a range.
And what we settled on was a range.
And those are some of the reasons for that.
I will also, just in terms of context,
it may be helpful to inform your decision-making.
There are some states that are far more generous.
There are some states that provide up to $200,000 a year.
There are some states that provide health care
for format inmates.
And so this proposal is candidly fairly limited,
but at least has a good procedure set forth
to make sure that one, the individual is innocent
and then two to give a recommendation.
And the last couple of things that it does substantively
are after this board, if it were to make a recommendation,
for compensation, is it would transmit to the claims
advisory board because that will be administratively
what it will be under, and then the claims advisory board will transmit it to the Chief Justice,
with the recommendation that it be put into the budget.
With that, the General Assembly will still have some oversight, so there is a safety valve,
so let's just say that for whatever reason the board gets it wrong, before we appropriate
that, they could alert us and then we could make a change to the budget.
I think that's highly improbable that that would happen.
And so then this would just be placed into the public state.
I think how we do it in the different chambers is slightly different.
In the house we have a public safety subcommittee on appropriations.
So it would come through that with the Judicial Council presenting it.
And wherever the Judicial Council presents to the Senate,
would be where that would be presented.
It would be line items for those specific individuals.
And then that's the basic gist of it.
And then the final thing, and this is on page 9 and 10,
an individual can have a claim for wrongful conviction.
So what this would do in beginning online 204
to the end of the bill is it would provide a credit to the state.
So if an individual has a claim for wrongful conviction,
they don't effectively get to double dip.
is the state will get a credit for that.
And the second paragraph, the second paragraph,
fee is that it's pending, and then there is a judgment.
Any amounts awarded under this would just be applied
to that wrongful conviction of war.
So we think that we put together a pretty thorough
piece of legislation to address this,
but I'd be happy to answer any questions at y'all.
Yes, Representative Hogan, let me,
Of course, I really appreciate the effort in this bill.
It's represented in this bill.
I think it's really a soul and it really is.
And we've complained over the years,
at least I have, that we need to just take this out
of our arena directly, so to speak,
and do the thing that I think your bill is attempting to do.
So I'm sure we all have some input on it,
but I wish you well, and I certainly hope it gets some input
from everybody so it can be pretty well structured
and can stand the test of time.
Representative, Senator Beach.
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Representative Holtman, for bringing this.
We talked about this last year,
creating something like this.
So if this panel, this five-member panel,
is created, they would be hearing these
instead of us today, correct, number one.
And number two, if they decided this person,
she'd get $75,000 a year for 10 years of wrong conviction,
wrongfully being convicted.
Would that be paid in an annuity?
Or would it be $750,000 in cash?
As written right now.
It's just cash, doesn't it?
It does say cash.
So right now we pay in an annuity, right?
We give an upfront payment and then pay over annuity.
Exactly.
So you would have to have some oversight
from the appropriation standpoint if we have to.
Because right now we've got $5.6 million just
on these cases here.
know, some of that's an annuity. I don't know how much is up front payment. I'd have to add
it up, but I just want to ask you that how the payments would be made. And I did see
in cash online. I forget what line, I mean, what page it was, but it's not a robber's
invalid either. Yeah, line 164 payment of compensation should be made in the form of
cash. Correct. So, I mean, do you think we should look at annuities or no, or do you
I think they should just get a check for whatever.
I do think that they should get a check.
And the reason is, is the vast majority of cases
that have come through the General Assembly,
they're not people that spent six months or a year.
They're people that spent 15 years, 20 years,
25 years, 30 years.
They don't have cash.
They don't have resources.
What we hear about the challenges for when people
are released from prison, how they get restarted,
they need housing, housing is really expensive.
So this money, again, it sounds like a lot,
but if you're working all year, you're paying a mortgage
and then you're having a home that's worth something.
So by giving these individuals money
to make an investment in housing,
to take care of their medical bills,
which undoubtedly they are going to have,
your health 100% is less good when you come
out of prison than before.
And then, as stated, they don't have retirement.
They don't have retirement because they've been locked up.
And so to have cash, and what I will tell you is,
I had the concern initially of, well,
being a little paternalistic, admittedly,
in terms of this view, of would they make good decisions?
There are organizations that help these individuals
to make good decisions when they're released.
there's an organization called After Innocence,
there's other organizations that work with these individuals,
so they're not spending it in a way that's frivolous or wasteful.
And I think they have an appreciation of time
that's very different from almost everybody else
because they lost so much of it.
And I would like to think that they would be good stewards
with the monies that they receive for that purpose.
So my recommendation would be to keep it as cash, certainly,
if the Senate wanted to move in an annuity way,
you certainly can but I think I think I think cash better serves the purpose
that we're trying to achieve. Okay. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Senator Robinson. Yeah
thank you Chairman Harveston. I want to be clear now once the individual
receives the money do they does the state pay the attorney's fees out of the
money or does the individual required to pay the attorney fees out of the
money that they receive. Because that's part of the legislation that they
receive the amount less attorney fees. Because I can only imagine, especially
in some of these bigger cases, that's going to be a fairly good hit.
Correct. They would be paid the monies than the legal fees would have to be
effectively, they'd be reimbursing for the legal fees that had already been
And putting the legislation together, I know Senator Beech was talking about it last
year.
We looked at some of this and we were looking at the possibility of hope for the individual
when they got out to go to two-year, you know, tech school or possibly even we discussed
four-year college funding for some of these individuals and various things.
But do you know of an avenue to where, and I'll use one of the judicial circuits that
I represent, but we'll say Chattahoochee Circuit, if an individual is convicted, and it's
determined that evidence was hidden by the prosecutor.
Other misconduct occurred, maybe I would never do it, thanks to Chief Deck Marby and
my instructor, but an officer that may have perjured themselves in court.
And once this is discovered, is there any responsibility put back on the circuit that
put this individual in the prison system to start with?
Because like you said, it's not the Department of Corrections fault that they received
the individual and processed them in and took care of them.
And I will push back a little bit on the health care because the health care and prisons
in jail have to be equal or better than the community standard.
I've written a lot of RFPs for health care, for prison, for jails.
And they have great dental care, psychiatric care, and medical care.
But is the circuit responsible at all for their mismanagement or just wrongly causing an
individual to be convicted?
I think there's different factors that could lead to a wrong conviction.
And what we're trying to do is to compensate the harm.
The cause I agree with you is important.
It could be that the jury just got it wrong.
And one thing of note on that is once you're convicted, in America we're very lucky that
you have the presumption of innocence before you're convicted, afterwards you don't.
All the legal cards are stacked against you when you're convicted.
So to get to a place of exoneration is extraordinarily, extraordinarily difficult.
Where did you find your definition of exoneration that's in the legislation?
Was that, was that ledge council?
Ledge council?
Yes.
And the prosecutors reviewed it for me too because I wanted to make sure that it wasn't
overbroad.
Yeah, because when I, when I spoke to ledge council and we got hung up on the definition
of exoneration, I did what any good student from Harris County would do and I went to the
dictionary.
And it says, free from guilt,
in which I think is a very high standard.
It means the individual is not guilty.
And so we run into some of these,
and I think you pointed it out
where we had a getaway driver
who was involved in an arm car robbery
where an individual was murdered.
This person went to prison,
stayed there for 20 years,
got out on a technicality.
There was never any doubt that he was,
and the prosecutor at that time said,
you know what, this case is old.
Witnesses have died, this other thing.
I just don't have the evidence to prosecute this individual.
So under that circumstance, that individual would not qualify under your legislation
correct?
Correct.
And what I would invite you to just say is that the district attorney would be invited
to the panel, and that would be another safeguard.
And I hear what you're saying, and I try not to do policy
making by anecdote, but sometimes it helps inform policy making.
I had a case that I prosecuted once that involved sexual
assault and it involved a very young victim,
and it was pretty egregious misconduct.
The young victim was very, very shy.
did not want to testify to everything that had happened.
And so in how we charged things, we
were very careful taking that into account.
Since the individual pled guilty, we got a conviction.
But then, as you know, we have to deal with the sentencing.
Since the victim did not want to talk about some of the humiliation
that was inflicted upon her, the judge
gave what I thought was a pretty lenient sentence.
We had what's called bridging the gap session afterwards,
where the judge met with the lawyers.
And I was in the army at the time.
I was a Jag Officer, and I'll admit,
I was beyond disrespectful.
And I can't swear here.
I tend to do that from time to time.
But in my remarks, I said that you got it wrong.
and he said, well, if I had known that A, B, and C had happened, I would have
issued a different judgment. And I said that did happen. I just couldn't put it
in front of you. So that's different in terms of the court system. But this, there
won't be those rules of evidence. And so a prosecutor could come in, could say,
look, I tried this case, this person did it, don't award it, and I'm telling you, and
I think a panel, it would be highly improbable that a panel would overrule a prosecutor
coming and saying that.
For all of the exonerees that the state has moved forward on, my understanding is that
the prosecutors have not taken that stance.
I have not done a survey of all of them, but I can tell you from the one that I worked
on last year, that was certainly true.
But I do think that we have a safeguard in there by providing that information or that
opportunity for the DA to come and share his or her views with this panel.
Well, I think you've had a lot of the marks in here and I appreciate your work on this.
And I do think it's important that we disconnect our heart from some of this stuff when we
do write policy because we can't put a face on it because our intention is for it to
impact 11 million George and should they find themselves in the circumstance.
I do appreciate your hard work on this.
Senator, see that Senator Beech,
and let's be mindful of Beecher is getting weight,
and I don't want to, yeah,
Senator, see that Senator Beech.
No, I was just going to say I have my point, Matt.
I didn't want to leave, and it's really, really.
It is not my health, thank you very much.
Senator Beech.
My look's all right, though, don't be afraid of something.
If it's over 1.5 million, the 1.5 million would be cash, and then the other money would
be in an annuity.
Because I tell you, if you got 25 years times 100,000, you're talking 2.5 million, would
you be?
I know cash is important to get a house and to kind of get them back on their feet.
Would you be amenable to a set amount of cash, not to exceed a certain amount, and then
the remainder be paid in an annuity.
And I think it would protect that person a little bit,
because you're gonna have family members
and so on trying to come in and say,
oh, you got a two and a half million dollars,
I need some money, you know?
You follow what I'm saying,
and I think it might even protect them
over the next 10 years if they had a 10 year annuity
after they got the initial 1.5 million, for example,
and limited to no more than 1.5 million in the cash payment,
and the rest would be paid out in some kind of annuity
or payment plan.
Senator Beige, I think that sounds very reasonable.
The only suggestion that I would have would be to make sure
that the newity would be inheritable by the individuals.
So if the individual's life doesn't-
Yeah, I think we've done that before.
Right, correct.
One case I hadn't read it, I think we've made-
Let's just something for the committee to consider.
And I think this is a real, real good legislation
worthwhile of our attention.
So if I could ask a your consideration of it,
do you want to move it up to the largest center
where we'll pass it up next week
and we'll look at it and try to perfect it
with some of the amendments
so we can perfect it between some of the concerns.
There's some of us how we can just,
and we're next week we'll move it out.
Is that amenable to us?
Yes, remember that.
Well, if you come back, they would take care of it, okay?
Any time that's true.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I know I got some other people,
somebody else had to get forget Tiffany brace well that that was already you okay
and let me let me find we just really it's some real serious stuff here we
want to make sure we are very careful about how we crafted and pass it out so
please if you come back next week we'll we'll we'll give it more time okay
hopefully we have the early in the day so we can have back members of the
committee if there are no other comments.
Of course, we stand adjourned.
Thank you.
Even for the Army guy, we'll really.
You
