you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you all all all all So long away from Southwest Georgia, you got to drive faster. All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machines? Doorkeepers, will you please close the doors and keep them closed? We'll take just a moment of personal privilege if you don't mind. Our pastor is going to be introducing just a moment. And I've asked him to certainly do what you all have been doing all weekend long. And that's praying for our dear friend, Terry England. Before he does that, I'm going to ask y'all to rise with me to our short support for Terry. He's probably watching us on TV right now, I bet you. Just give you a quick update, just nothing real specific other than this. His loving wife Cindy is right there by his side. Friends, family, church members are right there by their side. Because they have been since the accident occurred. He'll also know how strong a man Terry is. One of the finest, finest Christian men I've ever met in my life. So our prayers, mind do, y'all do, our support continues and we'll continue to go to Terry. It's going to be a few days recovering, but he'll be fine. I told him that yesterday when I left him, he just smiled at me. Terry, you'll be fine. But and he will be. So I also ask you all text messages, phone calls, but respect his privacy. See, goes through these days of recovery. That's important to me and my family. That's important to this house family. And Terry as a former member of this house is part of this family. But I know even more importantly, he's dear to the good Lord and he's dear to everyone of us in this room. And all those know the man because it's easy to know his heart. And his heart is for people. Just bow just for a minute before I turn it over to the pastor. Thank you, God for blessings. What a good man like Terry England. Help guide our thoughts on our actions, Lord in so many different ways. And we ask your. Your presence be with him and with Cindy. See, recovery's bring him back lower to the next appointed time as you would have him to be here with us. We miss him and we love him. Amen. Thank you members. Appreciate you. As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading in prayer by our chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain today will be introduced by the gentleman from the one hundred and twenty-fifth house district, representative Gary Richardson, representative Richardson. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'd like to introduce Reverend John Fender, the senior pastor at Redeemer Church in Evans, Georgia. He is originally from Jessup. And but spent most of his early years in Glen County where his father and grandfather owned the grocery store on Jack O'Leary. He met his future wife Leslie as a freshman at Mercer University and they have been married for twenty-nine years. He spent much of his adult life in Pula, Georgia where he had started a Presbyterian church. John and Leslie have two daughters, Caroline and Catherine. Caroline is married and lives in Nashville, Tennessee. And Catherine is engaged and serves overseas in the ministry. At this time I'd like to ask Pastor John to come up. Thank you, sir. Yeah. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the privilege of speaking on the floor. Thank you, Mr. Richardson, for the invitation. It's a great joy to be here. Our daughter's service praises here some dinner, fifteen years ago, with Mr. Hitchens, I believe. And it's an honor to be back before you this morning. If you have, regardless if you've been this chamber for a short time or a very long time, you understand the weight of the world. Whether the weight comes most particularly from national politics or state politics or maybe your own district or the way the world comes from your own home, your own marriage, your own children, your grandchildren, or maybe your own health, you understand the world we live in is quite a broken and hard place at times. And we get longing and looking for a place which is fixed and steady and permanent, a place where I can trust and rely upon. I know I'm in a room full of influential and powerful people, but you are human like me. You live with the frailty of a body that's getting a little older every day. You live in an economy that has certain limitations of time and treasure and talent. We belong for something more, something permanent, something I can depend upon. What I want to show you today in two verses, just very quickly, is a man with the age of 25 ascended to his political role. His name was Hezekiah. He steps in at a point where his father was the wicked King Ahas. He takes over at 25 the southern kingdom of Judah, around 715 BC. But I want you to see, not just Hezekiah, I want you to see where he looked in the moment of trial. And I want you to see what he found in that moment. That you, in your role, in your stage of life, with your responsibilities, with all the weight on you, you might say, oh, to have what Hezekiah had in God's Word. 2nd King, chapter 18, verse 5-6. He, that's Hezekiah, trusted in the Lord, the God of Israel, so that there was no one like Him among all the kings of Judah after Him, or among all the kings who were after before Him, for He held fast to the Lord. You have to understand what His father did. His father was the one who shut the temple. If you know anything about the Old Testament, the greatest moment was the temple. His father closed it down and said, you can't go in. His father said, we'll have no more priests. We'll shut down the political priests. The Passover, the high day of the year, he stopped as a national institution. Hezekiah said, no, we're opening the temple, we're reinstating the priests, and we're doing the Passover every year again and again. There was massive reforms happening. I don't tell you to say I want you to have religious reforms. That's not my point. But the challenges were tremendous. But the single greatest challenge was the Assyrians. The most dominant power in all the world had marched through Israel. It was on its way to Judah to Jerusalem to Hezekiah. You can't stop them. And so in this moment, what is a now 39-year-old man do in the moment of crisis? Well, that's 2nd King chapter 18. The Bible says, he held fast to the Lord. The language of a clinched fist, I'm going to grab a hold of one thing, one God, and trust that He can deliver me. Because what Hezekiah understands in 2nd King's chapter 18 is that if they're getting out of the mess, it will not be Hezekiah's wisdom or a strength or a problem. It's a promise or a promise or a promise to legislate or a whip up a crowd or a raise an army. He couldn't do those things to his own strengths. So what does He do? The one thing He understands, I know my God, I will hold fast of my God. Now something beautiful happens in the Bible the more you study it, that we look at from the outside and say, religion must be me, grabbing a hold of God. It's a God who is not only holding on long enough to get there, but also at the end. Only to realize if you read the Bible more carefully, the God that we're trying to hold onto is a God who says, if you'll embrace me, I'll hold on to you. So in this moment is the Bible unfolds. We get to the New Testament with all the brilliant clarity of the New Testament. And God who sends his son, the Lord Jesus Christ, as the Savior of all those who would trust in Him. And He realized that the Savior...

recessed to us in John chapter 10 about those who are his own, those are his sheep. He says, I, I give them eternal life and they will never perish. And then here's the same language. I will hold them in my hand and not lose one of them. And my father who is greater than them all holds them in his hand and no one can snatch them out of my hand. So in this kind of contrast for a moment, Hezekiah momented adversity, what does he do? Holds fast to God. But Hezekiah's confidence and John Finder's confidence is never about John Finder's grasp. The Bible says that God will hold on to us. Doubly joined in the hand of the Father and the hand of the Son whereby no one can snatch us away. So as I come to you today to minister to you, I thank you for the providence speaking. But I'm commending to you the ultimate source of security in this life and the life to come. His name is God Almighty and his Son is the Lord Jesus Christ who comes as a free gift and says, if you'll come to me, if you'll hold on to me, here's what I'll do. I will hold on to you. So when you're a moment of weakness and limitation, you can rest confident. Our God is able and He will hold you fast. Please join me in prayer. Well, Lord, I've got Almighty, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. We thank you for being a God who does not change. A God who is faithful and true. A God who makes promises and keeps every single promise. A God who holds fast to his people. Would you reveal yourself in powerful ways to those in this room to care for their greatest needs, name of the forgiveness other sins and to care for their every need? We ask that you would bless them today as you would, they serve the state of Georgia. Would you lead them and direct their every step? And we lay before you, O God, your servant to England. Mindful that your word says, a sparrow doesn't fall to ground, apart from the will of our Heavenly Father. We thank you for the way you have protected Him. And for the limitations of the injury, though, we know that they are substantial. Would you heal every bit of that we ask? In the meantime, O Lord, prove yourself sufficient for every moment. And every day, from now until a full recovery, we ask that you administer to Him and to His family, body and soul. We lay His name before your throne of grace, asking you to be gracious. Bless His body now, O Lord, and hold Him in your hand as they run to your Son, Jesus. And His name we pray, amen. Please join me in the pledge of allegiance. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America. And to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, individual, will ever keep the message for all of us. Thank you. Doorkeepers, you may unlock the doors, members. As you know, you may join our pastor. Thank you for that message, Pastor John. In the south any room, and thank you for His service to us today.

Hearing plays a critical role in communication and personal relationships over and overall help that outcomes as well as psychological well-being and safety. Hearing loss has been tied to decline of cognitive function, falls, depression and isolation. It can be a symptom of underlying condition, including but not limited to infections, tumors and myres disease, typically which is irreversible. My noise-induced hearing is also a problem, especially with maybe younger people with the devices these days and that is 100% preventable. The Georgia Society of Hearing Professionals, a chapter of the Hearing Society is composed of hearing and health care professionals including hearing aid specialists, audiologists who are trained to specialize in identification of hearing loss and rehabilitation through hearing aids and related devices and counseling. Georgia Hearing Day was founded by the Georgia Society of Hearing Professionals and aims to raise awareness of how to prevent deafness and hearing loss and to promote hearing and well-being.

Through education, outreach, and policy efforts, the foundation empowers individuals and their families while partnering with medical professionals and lawmakers to improve healthcare access.

We have a contingent of people here from Effingham County. And most people don't know where Effingham County is. It's 250 miles down the road, a four-hour drive. But it's one of the original eight counties in Georgia and the home of our first selected governor, John Adam Trudelon. But we have a significant, we got chairman of the county commission, most of the county commissioners, most of the school board members, the county manager, and several people that are on the elected positions on the city council. So if you'd all stay in from Effingham County, we'd appreciate it. We bring the crowd. The rumor is, Chairman, you were on first name basis with that first governor, John Adam Trudelon's any truth to it. Welcome to all our friends and family from Effingham County. We appreciate y'all. As always, making the trip up here, we encourage all the members of the night to join them at the reception. Miss Chairman, what time is that reception? What time is that reception? Let's check in to see if you had your facts straight. I'll let you know before we adjourn. We'll make sure we got all the details in just a minute. But I liked your order though, it was very good. That concludes our morning orders in the afternoon. Mr. Clerk, members, if you'll give the clerk your attention, we have an invite resolution, Chairman Dickie, if you'll join me. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very, very special invite resolution. So spend just for a minute. Members, if you'll take your seats or take your conversations, they'll import it to the dining room. Members, please take your seats and give the clerk your attention. This is a very, very important. These folks mean a lot to us. In fact, they keep your lights on. How important is that? Mr. Clerk. House resolution 80 by reps of Dickie, the 134th, Jasper, the 11th. Nelson, the 72nd, the 113rd, 4th, the 170th and others. A resolution congratulating the Georgia Electric Membership Corporation on 85 years of service and recognizing February 10th, 2025 as Georgia EMC Day at the State Capitol. Chairman Robert Dickie, you live in rural Georgia, don't you? I bet you own an EMC. I hope you're absolutely correct. Chairman's recognized. Thank you, Miss Speaker. Join here by Chairman Parsons as well. And thank you members of the House and guests here in the gallery. It's an honor for me to stand here to recognize the 85th anniversary of our Georgia Electric Membership Co-operatives. To give you a little history, back in 1930 when electricity was very available in our cities, but other rural areas of our state were totally ignored with electricity. Much like broadband was not so long ago. And so in 1935, President Roosevelt signed an executive order establishing the electric electrification administration, the R.E.A. And enabled our grassroots, not for profit, consumer-owned electric properties to form. In 1937, Central Georgia Electric Cooperative was chartered along with Habersam and Jackson EMC the next year. Now, our state has 41 EMCs throughout Georgia with an overall economic impact of 8.3 billion. 8 taxes of 140 million and our EMCs support almost 15,000 jobs. I especially want to thank the hardworking dedicated alignment who worked seven days a week, tirelessly 24 hours a day for weeks only in to get our rural communities power restored after Hurricane Helene this fall. It was a Herkleyian effort to do that. In addition to the economic impact our state EMCs bring and the essential power, EMCs support a wide variety of statewide education programs, Washington Youth Tour and the Walter Harrison Scholarship. Mr. Speaker, our very own Terry England is alumni of that scholarship and it has made a huge difference with our young people throughout the state. When we round up, I have to mention this well. It does a tremendous impact on our rural communities when members round up. So I just want to stand here. Thank you, our EMCs, all the members. We're thankful for 85 years of rural electrification in our state. And so thank you all for this day and recognition of them. A lot of great programs that EMCs have been involved in, impacted a lot of lives more than just providing power but also education and opportunity for many young people to go to Washington. It's pretty special what y'all do. And I want to let y'all know I fulfill one of the things on my bucket list this morning. I went 60 feet up in a bucket truck this morning. So I can guarantee I was holding on with both hands. I suppose I'll hope it gets cut. Yeah, there was that part. Thank you for what y'all do and what you're going to continue to do to make George the best place to live, work, and raise a family. We appreciate you. Thank you members. Thank you. Of course we have a group of privilege resolutions that we're going to hear from right now and then we'll go on to we have a little more business than we also have afternoon orders.

Is there any objection to adopting the privilege resolutions here in none of the resolutions are adopted? We're going to move on after-and-a-after members if you give me our attention we're going to we have some a couple of special afternoon after-and-a-after orders I'm going to call on Chairman Martin first and the Roswell Fulton County delegation just hold one minute before you take the well. Members will take your seats cease all conversation and give the members in the well your attention. Representative Crow is also joining. Here's our posture y'all. We're going to hear from Chairman Martin then we're going to hear from Representative Glaze and then we're going to hear from Representative Williams and the Savannah delegation. I'm going to ask all members to go ahead and stand in and remain standing for all three of these afternoon orders. Chairman Martin. Members I stand before you today with members of the Roswell delegation and others to honor Roswell police officer Jerry LeBonte. And to communicate the heartbreak that the Roswell Police Department and the entire city is failing with the loss of officer LeBonte. He was 24 and he was killed in the line of duty the evening of September 7th 2025 last Friday. The accused shooter is in custody. Officer LeBonte joined the Roswell Police Department on November 1st 2021 continuing a lifetime of commitment to public service that began well before his decision to become an officer over the years that followed the officer faithfully and jointly served the Roswell community as a member of the night shift patrol alongside D squad brothers and sisters. He was universally beloved by all who were blessed to know him as a friend, a husband, a son, and a public servant. His absence now leaves a void that can never be filled. I have been asked to relay that the Roswell Police Department is deeply moved by the outpouring of support from agencies and communities across the nation. Though there are too many to name the Roswell community is profoundly grateful for every expression of kindness and solidarity during this difficult time. Mr. Speaker and members each of us woke up Saturday February 8th safe in our homes because of the service and sacrifice of our first responders. Will you join us now in a moment of silence for officer Jeremy LeBonte, a hero that gave his life to provide that very safety if you would join me in a moment of silence. Thank you. I yield the well. Thank you, Representative Martin. Thank you members. Our heart felt condolences go out to officer LeBonte's family. Thoughts and prayers will certainly have been and will continue to be offered for them. Representative Glaze, recognize for an after-norder. Give the lady your attention. If the city of South Fulton delegation would come up, please. The city of South Fulton, if you would join the lady in the well, lady will suspend just for a moment. I stand here before you today and you look at the picture of someone who we know and love in 95 years old. We call her mother Arnold. She was too many in the Fairburn area more than the mother. She was the first African American in the South Metro area elected to council. She held that office for 12 years. She was on our school board. She was mainly a friend of every governor, last six governors of this state. How I got here, many years ago in 1992, she started bringing me to meet the governors of Georgia. I believe I stand on her shoulders in so many more of us in South Fulton. Mother Arnold was a bridge. She never met a stranger and she never met anybody that she didn't love. I didn't say like. I said love. She didn't meet anyone that she didn't meet, that she didn't invite to come into the Christian faith because that was her faith and that's what she stood on. This past Saturday we gave her her flowers while she was living but we gave her her flowers as she moved on and transitioned in the city of Fairburn. All of South Fulton stand here today to say more mother Arnold's in Georgia will continue to make Georgia the number one place to live. I know it because she invited so many of us to be in the South Fulton corridor and fill love. So if you would just give us just a moment of silence in recognition of her great work as a human being as a Christian woman. Thank you. Thank you, Representative Glaze and members. Representative Al Williams, the Savannah delegation and the Liberty and Bryan County delegations, Liberty County, Bryan County and Savannah Chatham County delegation. Representative Williams will suspend just for a moment. And General Most recognized it. Thank you, Miss Speaker. After the tragic accident in Washington, we're a commercial airline and the UA 16 Nighthawk collided and many lives were lost. We did not know immediately who those lives were the names of those people. But we've learned recently that one of them particularly, Staff Sergeant Ryan O'Hara was the crew chief on the UA 60. And he was doing maneuvers. They do about 200 a day and their mission is to know how they're going to evacuate Washington DC in the case of terrorism or some other action. Now his father resides in Midway Georgia. He's my constituent. His father and mother. He lived in Richmond, Hill. But most importantly, his dad was the Nighthawk pilot. So he knew exactly what they went through. He's made several recommendations to the Army as to prevent this from happening again. There's a fine young man engaged to be married, taking much too soon, practicing in defense of us as citizens. Which is speaker with your permission. I'd like to yield to Chairman Stevens. Chairman Stevens recognized. Ladies and gentlemen, those of us in coastal Georgia, we just never know how these families that are touched, if you will, are whenever none of us are guaranteed tomorrow. And sometimes as these family members proliferate and we realize that their world ended right then. Would you just join me in just a small moment of silence for these coastal Georgians? Thank you. Amen. Right before we stop the body came home to Savannah. And last weekend in the services will be at the Armstrong Georgia campus of Georgia Southern on Saturday. Thank you very kind. Mrs. Speaker, thank you. We yield well. Thank you, coastal members. A life dedicated and service for our country members. You may be seated. Our condolences go out to that family as well. Leader Hewgley, you ready? But we have him quiet. Y'all give the lady in the well. Your attention please. Thank you, Mrs. Speaker. I come to celebrate a servant leader today. And I'm going to ask every member of a divine nine organization to come and stand with me in this moment. Every member of a divine nine organization. You got to earn your way. So, Mrs. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the house, we come to celebrate one of our own representative, Ronda Brinnell. On the occasion of her 50th anniversary as a member of Delta Sigma Theta Surority Incorporated, Y'all can come up. All of us in our respective organizations work to achieve this milestone. And it means that she has shown commitment not only to her organization, but to making a difference in her community for 50 years. And we congratulate you. Thank you, Mrs. Speaker. We yield the well. Thank you. Nice honor. Congratulations. 50 years. You must have been a child when you got in that organization. No doubt about that. Representative Dawson. Here he comes. Y'all give the gentleman to have a photo. You can put up as well. Representative Dawson's recognized for a moment in black history. Thank you, Speaker. Give the gentleman your attention, please. Thank you, Speaker, colleagues and guests in the gallery. Before our black history moment, I'd like to pause to offer my prayers to Terry and Cindy England. My family stands with yours, Terry. We're praying for the speaker, the speaker's office, and the entire general assembly as we navigate this together. Terry is a tough, and we're going to tough this out with him. Today for the black history moment, I recognize an inspirational American, A.G. Gatson, who is a grandson of slaves who built a business empire that played a vital role in the civil rights movement in my hometown, Birmingham, Alabama. Gatson found that a bank, a funeral home, a hotel, a restaurant, a construction company, radio stations, the Booker T Washington Insurance Company, and a business school. They're all in operation still to this day. And his success wasn't just personal. It uplifted an entire community. His legacy also shaped my life. So I opened my first bank account at his bank. My grandparents and my parents built their first homes with financing from him. Three of my aunts, one of them is at Emory Medical School. They attended his business school and built successful careers. And this is a note, my first foray into business came when the president of Gatson's bank, Bunny Stokes, let me in my buddy Lamont cut his yard.
