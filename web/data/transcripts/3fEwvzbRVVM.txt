Repeat after me. No ice. No ice. No murders. No murders. No murders. No murders. No murders. My name is Josh McLaren. Thank you again.
And I ice protesters join a press conference by Senate Democrats to announce legislation
aimed at regulating ice in Georgia.
Good evening.
Welcome to lawmakers on this day two of the Georgia legislative session.
I'm Donna Lowry in Atlanta.
More on ice bills introduced by Senate Democrats coming up.
Senate Republicans also had news for the press today as they announced their 2026 caucus
priorities.
On the show tonight, we'll hear from the leaders of both parties about what they discussed
at the Capitol today.
Georgians, like the rest of the country, have a multifaceted relationship with AI.
It's new and exciting, but it can also be frightening, especially when it comes to children.
We're going to talk with lawmakers who will discuss both aspects of AI.
We'll get to all of that after a wrap-up of the day of the Capitol from our correspondent,
Sarah Callis.
Hi, Donna.
Lawmakers looked into state approaches to national immigration enforcement questions.
On day two, the Senate jumped to a quick start today when they passed the first bill of
the session.
SB 204 was originally a Democratic bill from 2025 that allowed certain non-violent felonies
to be charged by district attorneys without the involvement of a grand jury.
last year's legislative session, the House gutted that bill and inserted language from Senate
Bill 163, which would allow individual gun owners to bring legal action against local
governments who they feel infringed on their second amendment rights by finding or confiscating
guns that owners left in their unlocked vehicles.
But the bill didn't get back to the Senate with the changes before the session ended.
Colton Moore who authored SB 163 made his case for why the new version of the pro-gun rights bill
should be adopted. Right now there are 41 Georgians in Savannah who are victims of a crime
who are now been made criminals because some municipality like Savannah has passed gun
legislation that is more stringent than what this General Assembly has already passed.
It gives those preemptive powers to the citizenry, so any citizen can sue a place like Savannah
for violating their gun rights at a tune of $25,000 per occurrence.
That puts teeth into it and they don't have to depend on some bureaucracy like our attorney
general to take care of their rights.
But the Democratic Senator who represents Savannah disagreed not only with the bill, but
with the premise as well.
The city of Savannah has passed, regulates the car and not the gun.
And this has reduced gun thefts of over 30% in one year in the city of Savannah alone.
The city overwhelmingly supports the second amendment, but they also believe that public
safety is at risk when guns are stolen from unlocked cars.
The bill was adopted by substitution, 32-21, along party lines, but failed to garner
the two-thirds majority needed to be sent to Governor Brian Camp immediately.
Meanwhile, the House gabbled in and gabbled out without passing any bills on day two,
but they gave special recognition to the Korean American community in Georgia.
At an afternoon press conference, Democratic lawmakers announced legislation affecting
immigration enforcement.
Senate Bill 389 would require ICE agents to remove their mask while making arrests
in where proper identification.
We have men who are unidentifiable, roaming our streets,
snatching up people, and taking them, and then they are able to commit crimes and hide because we don't even know their identity.
So my bill will call for ICE agents to take off their mask, to show their face.
We have men who show up in tactical equipment, but nothing that identifies them as federal agents.
I don't know if they are a part of a vigilante group that's just to deputize themselves to
go and steal my friend or if they're an agent of ice.
So my bill demands that they put on a badge, that they have something on them that tells
us undeniably that they are a federal agent.
My friends, it's time to unmask ice.
Democrats also propose bills to allow civil lawsuits against ice and require a warrant
for arrests in schools, hospitals and churches.
When ICE overreaches, they need to face real accountability in courts of law.
But accountability is not necessarily justice, because Renee Good will not get justice, and
there's no way to give her justice.
Real justice making sure this never happens in the first place.
The legislation comes days after ICE officers in Minnesota fatally shot a woman.
But Republicans say the bills are unnecessary, and lawmakers reacted too quickly to the
Minnesota shooting. As far as wearing a tactical gear, whether it be a mask, a helmet or
anything else, that is a decision made, based, case by case, and the supervisors make
those determinations. Not a group of legislators sitting in an air-conditioned heated room
in the middle of Atlanta, Georgia. That's the responsibility of law enforcement leaders
to make that decision. The Democrats also proposed a bill requiring national guard deployment
in Georgia to receive legislative approval.
Also today, Governor Brian Kemp and legislative leaders
in the House and Senate gathered
at the annual Faith and Freedom Coalition's
legislative luncheon.
Tomorrow, lawmakers will start their day early
at Georgia Chambers Annual Ex-Nissues legislative breakfast.
There, they will hear from Governor Kemp
about his priorities for his last legislative session.
That's my capital report, Donna.
Thanks, Sarah.
We're going to get deeper insight into what to expect during this 2026 legislative session
from two leaders in the Senate.
Here in the studio is the newly elected Senate President Pro Tem, Republican Senator Larry
Walker, the third of Perry.
He has served in the Senate since 2015 and is former chair of the Insurance and Labor
Committee.
So we're so glad he's here also joining us is the Senate Minority Leader, Democratic
Senator Harold Jones, the second of Augusta.
He's been in the Senate since 2014,
and his committees include Judiciary.
Welcome to lawmakers, both of you,
with your NW names, the second, third.
Okay, all righty.
Pro Tim Walker, you led the Senate caucus press conference
today, and the caucus calls for a focus
that it says, re-ignite the American dream.
You broke down priorities into three areas,
the cost of living, quality of life, and the next generation.
So let's start with cost of living, which looks at taxes.
Tell us a little bit about that.
Sure, Donna.
So everywhere we, all the constituents we hear from,
whether it's Blue Ridge, down to Bainbridge,
they're straining under the rising cost of living.
And we hear that, and we're going to focus on that.
It's cost of housing, cost of groceries, cost of childcare.
And the American Dream, this is the 250th anniversary
of America and Georgia.
And sadly, the American Dream seems out of reach
for too many people.
And so our focus is gonna be on affordability.
Yeah, so I know one of them has to do
with the state income tax rate.
You mentioned that.
And then the stop, it says stop skyrocketing
local property tax bills by capping home valuations.
So I've had the press have your little flyer here.
Tell us about that.
So under Lieutenant Governor Jones's leadership,
we had a study committee over the interim
to look at our income tax situation.
And we have a plan to eliminate state income tax
on the first 50,000 of earnings for a single filer
or 100,000 for a married filer filing jointly.
So that will eliminate the state income tax
on two-thirds of Georgians,
and we're very excited about that.
We also hear from our constituents on a regular basis
that they're skyrocketing property tax,
and we've already dropped a bill to address that,
which would be a floating homestead exemption
that would limit the increase on property tax
to the rate of, on your home, to the rate of inflation.
Okay, thank you.
Any comment on any of that?
I know you, the income tax, you've spoken out about that.
He's spoken out about the income tax,
but I think one of the things is affordability,
of course, is the buzzword of the year.
And one of the ways we're going to be attacking
that particular issue is through Medicaid expansion
and also actually having tax credits
when people actually bring their premiums down
as far as their health insurance is concerned.
Because that is a major crisis within Georgia,
health insurance.
And so number one, we'd have Medicaid expansion,
which you can actually help get more people insured,
and over a million joins right now,
we're depending on those federal tax credits.
So at some states have done,
even before what's recently happened,
is they created their own tax credits,
so their people could actually afford
those premiums or deductibles.
And so what we've been proposing,
we actually started it last year with SB192,
and it will continue this year
to actually have our own tax credits
to address that particular issue.
So when we talk about affordability,
the question really becomes,
what issues are you looking at?
And then secondly,
how do you actually make those things affordable?
The thing is, you're both talking affordability.
That's the main thing.
I want to focus on you for a little bit,
because I want to make sure we get,
you spoke at the press conference today
about ICE and Democrats present at three bills.
You have one that is SB 390,
and it is to put limits on the National Guard.
Tell us about it.
Right, what it basically says is out of a state
on National Guard cannot come in unless
it has the permission of the governor.
And so other states have actually done this too.
South Carolina being one, Kansas being another Washington
to actually pass a similar law.
So it's not anything particularly unusual.
And so what the press conference was day about
was number one, we were focusing on ICE,
I think we saw that.
But then secondly, it's actually a larger issue.
And that issue is the fact that a lot of people
are actually concerned and scared
about the overreach that this administration is doing.
And quite frankly, after the last event that we had in Minnesota,
it almost seems like death was actually
normalized to some extent by this president,
the way the callus where they kind of looked
at what had taken place.
And so people are nervous and they're scared about what's going on and we want it to address
those particular issues.
Okay.
I didn't know whether you want to comment on that or we can move on to quality of life.
Let's talk about quality.
God tell us what the quality of life, what you're talking about in terms of that.
Well we know we have to have safe communities and so we're going to continue to invest in
safe communities.
We also know that part of your quality of life is having opportunities to enjoy the
great outdoors.
George is a beautiful state and we're going to look at ways to further protect lands.
Our state is growing because we've had strong leadership and our economy is attracting
a lot of industry and a lot of manufacturing, which we're proud of, but we want to make
sure we do protect opportunities to protect lands and let people enjoy the great
outdoors.
I was real proud to have carried, sponsored, and carried the George Outdoor Stewardship Act
several years ago under Governor Deal, and I hope we can maybe expand that, and that's
where a portion of the sales tax revenue on outdoor recreation equipment goes to a
quire in land to protect for the public use.
Okay.
Anything else you wanted to mention in terms of democratic priorities in your caucus?
Another issue you're going to be housing, which was also mentioned, but the way you actually
approach it is going to be key.
So some of those issues you can deal with from kind of like a regulatory level, such as zoning.
But also you want to look at the fact that private equity, Georgia is one of the worst offenders as far as private equity buying so many homes.
Here's the problem with that. What happens is they're not buying those homes for people to live in as a home.
They're buying those homes that actually jack up the rent store to speak.
And that becomes problematic.
And so we're actually gonna have a bill to talk about trying to limit private equity buying up all these homes in Georgia
And as I said in Atlanta actually is a victim of this quite frankly and other parts of Georgia are too
So number one, we'll look at regulatory features and then number two, we'll look at private equity to try to get people into their homes
Okay, let's get to your next generation because part of it deals with something
We're gonna talk about later and that's protecting children when it comes to AI
But you're really focusing on things when it comes to schools and those kinds of things
Yeah, so AI certainly has a lot of benefits to it.
We just want to make sure they're guardrails around it so that, for example, you don't want
AI to be imitating a child and be on social media that would damage that child.
There just needs to be guardrails around it.
And I'm sure your next guest will know a lot more about it than I do, but it's an interesting
topic, but it is a little, as you said in the intro, a little scary to me in my generation
anyway.
Yeah, so also absenteeism, you guys looked at and literacy rates, so those are two things
you're going to look at.
Yeah, we have a chronic absenteeism problem and we're going to address that this year.
I will say that I do agree with the leader, minority leader on the private equity, buying
up and driving up the cost of housing that's something I think we can work
together on and I look forward to that. Yeah absolutely. So one of the things I
wanted to ask before you go is what we're hearing is that you from both sides is
you guys are agreeing on a lot. Yes. Do you agree that that's true? We're
agreeing on a lot we just have to make you see the details. That's not always
going to be the key but I think one of the good things is that sending
approach and walking myself I should have great relationships. I think that
at what add to the possibility of getting things done.
So you agree that we may not see things as contentious
as we've seen in the past?
I hope we're going to just focus on putting Georgia's first
and focus on kitchen table issues that really matter.
Not get caught up in all the political grandstanding,
this is an election year, and all the political posturing.
I hope we can keep the main thing, the main thing.
Okay.
Well, I want to thank you both for coming on the show,
and maybe we'll have you on a little bit later.
Thank you.
All righty, thank you so much.
Well, coming up, the good, the bad,
and the unknown when it comes to technology
and artificial intelligence.
Two lawmakers update us on what to expect during the session
on everything from air taxis to AI chat box and more.
Lawmakers is made possible by Georgia Farm Bureau.
With over 80 years of helping everyone understand
the importance of agriculture in our state.
After all, Ag is Georgia's number one industry.
Food and fiber production represents over 74 billion
in output of Georgia's strong economy.
The Georgia Farm Bureau legislative team works
to represent producers across Georgia at the state capital
during the session and year round.
Georgia Farm Bureau, the voice of Georgia farmers.
People put their faith in PBS because they know
that it is constantly delivering quality.
It covers the whole of the United States.
It's a free and independent media.
We go where the viewers are.
What are the conversations that are happening right now?
We feel that civil discourse is a civic responsibility.
What we do is authentic reporting the people and trust.
We give time so you can hear voices on all sides of an issue.
This is the place that people turn to for stories that matter.
And they know that when they walk away,
they will have learned something about the world around them.
That's why this makes PBS important for daily life and the Nanda world.
Thank you for joining us.
Community, learning, working, playing, celebrating, doing life is always better together.
At GPB, we aim to provide you with the tools to be able to do life together well.
Our mission to educate, inform, and entertain inspires everything from our wide range of
programming to our stimulating radio conversations to our fun in-person events.

Welcome back to lawmakers. I'm Donna Lowry.
Technological innovations speed up faster than many of us can keep up.
Our state is helping to keep things moving.
According to the Georgia Department of Economic Development, Georgia is proudly
at the forefront of digital health, cybersecurity,
fintech, and creative technology.
Now, that's great for Georgians in the workforce,
but as technology grows, there's a need to create laws
that protect Georgians.
Joining me are Republican Representative Todd Jones
of South Versailles. He chairs the House Committee
on Technology and Infrastructure Innovation
and Democratic Senator Sally Harrell of Atlanta.
her committees include government oversight.
She also co-chaired a Senate study committee
on social media, AI, and children over the past few months.
And welcome to lawmakers to both of you.
We're glad to have you here.
I'm going to start with you, Chairman Jones.
Give us a general picture of the types of innovation
that your committee will look at technology,
this coming session.
Look, Donna, for over a decade,
we've been the number one place to do business.
We're now shifting to becoming the most innovative place
to do business in the entire country.
We're going to take leadership in places like mobility,
in terms of air taxis, in terms of autonomous vehicles.
We're going to take those folks that have been,
in a sense, stuck in their home because of disability,
because of old age.
And we're going to help them get out, vis-a-vis AV.
We're going to bring traffic off into the air.
We're going to go ahead and use a creative manufacturing.
A lot of people call that 3D printing
to absolutely expand everything that we can print
or an intense manufacturer here in Georgia
and for outside of our state.
In other words, we're going to take literally what AI can do,
what human beings can do, robotics can do,
and transform education, health care, transportation,
just about everything that a Georgian touches
is gonna be transformed in the next five to 10 years.
And you'll need to put guardrails on that.
We are gonna have to put guardrails on it,
but I'll tell you this, on the innovation side,
we wanna make sure that this is very similar
to the third industrial revolution,
we're in the fifth industrial revolution.
When Carnegie and Rockefeller and Edison,
when they were making those changes,
and they were giving those great innovations
in steam and electricity,
There wasn't a lot of guardrails on the innovation side.
We want to do the same thing.
We want to give our innovators a chance to innovate
and really change the game economically,
health care, and education.
No, I know you have done a lot with urban transportation.
We'll get to that in a moment.
Senator Harrell, I want to actually start with you
with the committee we talked about
and play a clip of a Decap County mother
who talked at one of the final ones.
She testified before your committee on October 10th.
Her name is Kay Fullerton.
She described how her fourth grader and his friends found an AI chat box but with a hunger
games theme.
And they started to have a conversation with it because they're kids and curious.
And that quickly descended into sexualized content on the school network in fourth grade.
And this wasn't blocked because of the nature of the website.
This is like CHAT GPT have these developer tools that allow developers to access these
large language models for fractions of a penny with no oversight on where that content
goes after it's produced by the model.
Yeah.
And Senator Harold, one of her concerns is, parents can't preview what these bots are doing.
So there's no way of monitoring any of that.
So talk a little bit about that.
That's right.
This parent came to me during session last year and told me this story.
and I immediately tried to find a bill to amend
because it was late in the session
so that we could fix this issue.
Unfortunately, the bill didn't pass
and so that's when I really pushed
to have this study committee.
This issue is personal for me.
My kids were like in middle school
when everybody started getting smartphones
and I could see that these programs on these phones
were fundamentally changing my children
and I tried to sound the alarm
and no one would hear me.
And so I've waited eight, 10 years
to be able to do something about it.
Now we have enough millennials
who have had kids who were scared about the phone
and what it can do to their children
that we have enough collective voices
that we can do something about it.
Yeah, I want to clarify something.
They watched at school and there are,
there's a way they block things.
Sure.
But they were able to get through.
Right, because this is new,
these AI companion chatbots are new.
And so the companies that help the schools monitor
what kids can access, they weren't on top of it.
And so this just slipped through.
Now, Ms. Fullerton did say that the school responded
really, really well and took care of the problem.
But this technology, it changes so quickly
that schools can't keep up, parents can't keep up.
So in the end, our committee made several recommendations
that we are turning into legislation now.
Okay, we're gonna talk about those in a minute.
I wanna get back to you, going back and forth.
You certainly agree with all of that,
and I've heard that there are members of your party
who'd certainly agree that there needs to be
something happening when it comes to these chat box
and things like that.
100%, look, we're seeing basically data telling us
that upwards of 75% of 15 year-olders in our state
consider their AI chatbot their best friend.
They're best friend.
We have to find a way to get that socialization
to be fundamentally different.
We got to put the guardrails on,
but frankly, we need to help of 11 million Georgians.
Because look, legislation can create that guardrail,
but we need the parents.
We need the grandparents, the uncles, the aunts,
and everyone else to understand this is changing,
and it's changing monthly.
It's changing daily, so all of us need to be super diligent
in terms of what we're doing and what we're doing
with our children, and I know that's hard.
I got four children, and I know how hard that is to do,
but between the guardrails that we can put on
with my colleague in the Senate,
and what we can also do to work with 11 million
Georgians, I think we can make a difference.
Yeah, talk a little bit about what you're expecting
to do with some legislation.
Right, so what we've realized is that these big tech
companies have discovered through the years
that the more engaged they keep the users,
the longer they keep them on the phone or the iPad,
the more money they make, selling information to advertisers.
So, they're making money off of our kids' attention.
And they're doing that now by designing the platforms
and the products to be addictive.
Designing things in where if you do something,
they give you something back, they give you a reward
that gives a little dose of dopamine
that makes you feel good.
So, the first thing we want to do is regulate the addictive design.
We don't want addictive products designed for our children.
And the second thing we want to do is address the chatbot, the companion chatbot issue.
This is critical.
This is going to make the situation so much worse.
Children are using these chatbots, they're becoming friends with these chatbots, and the
parents, they don't know yet that their children are interacting with these chatbots.
We had parents who told horrible stories about the chatbot actually telling the child to
kill himself, to commit suicide.
I listened to that, it was just terrifying.
It's awful.
No parent knows what this chatbot is going to say to their child.
So those parents out there, I would tell you, find out if your children are using companion
chatbots, if they are, please teach them about the dangers.
We want to hold these companies accountable.
If a parent bought a doll and the doll said, kill yourself, that company would be liable
because they had a product, just like cars.
have to study safety measures before they bring out a new model. We want these
companies to be responsible for the products they put out in the harms that they
cause in terms of AI chatbots. And then finally we want to give parents more
power. So the parental controls they're very difficult to use and parents are
frustrated and the kids find their ways around them. So we're supporting
something called the App Store Accountability Act, which when a parent buys a phone for
a child, the phone is linked to the parent's phone.
If a child tries to download an app, a notification is sent to the parent, and the parent can decide
whether to approve the app or not.
That's easier than parental controls.
And then the very last thing we're doing, last year we passed a law banning cell phones
in schools K through 8.
I believe we are going to come back and add high schools.
And I know that they're talking about that both in the Senate and certainly in the House.
That's going to happen.
So that's good.
I want to get back to you about something, while we still have time, I know that when it
comes to the air taxis, something special is going to happen in 2026.
And you've been working on this for a long time.
For a long time, knock wood, we're going to get special permission to be able to land
an air taxi right in the middle of the Georgia World Congress Center at the kickoff.
And I don't mean that as a pun at the kickoff of the World Cup.
And this is literally the world looking at us, billions of people looking at Atlanta
and being able to land an air taxi and simultaneously bringing up an autonomous vehicle and hopefully
having the FIFA head, our governor, our speaker, and our lieutenant governor going into a 3D
printed mini house.
Because we want to show that affordable housing can be done, it can be done in our state
and we can do it through a creative manufacturing.
So we're going to go ahead and put all together basically an entire portfolio of innovation
for the world to see that George is leading the way.
So they're going to start at this very report.
Vert report?
Vert report, up in the North Bolton, right?
The governor and all of these officials
are going to go to the Georgia World Congress Center
and then there's going to be this house there.
That is our hope.
And we're hoping to get the final approvals on that.
And any of you who know anyone at the FAA
would like to be able to get that from them.
And for people who don't understand,
These taxis are going to go along the interstate,
and they'll be able to go to Hart's Field
and different things like that.
Yeah, look, imagine an idea where you're going to be able
to go out to your rideshare app,
and you're going to have a choice of,
do you want to go autonomous, do you want to go driver,
or do you want to go in the air?
And you're going to be able to go in the air
and literally go from, say, to the northern arc
to Fox Theater, to the northern arc into the airport.
You name it, you're going to now have a defined commute time
as opposed to guessing what your commute time's
going to be based on traffic.
and autonomous.
And autonomous.
And autonomous.
Yeah.
Well, okay.
So much to talk to you too about.
Thank you so much for coming on.
We'll keep up with these issues.
Thank you so much.
Thank you for also joining lawmakers today.
Tomorrow on day three of the session, House leaders
from the majority of minority parties will outline
what they would like to accomplish this year.
And we'll also hear from members of the Senate Committee
on eliminating the state income tax.
Have a nice evening.
Yeah.
Thank you.
