TRANSCRIPT
----------
Okay. Good afternoon and thank you all for being here. I want to welcome members of the
press, our community partners, advocates, and mostly importantly, the executive board
and members of the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus. I am deeply honored to serve alongside
this dedicated group of legislators who represent communities across our state and who are
united by a shared commitment to justice, equity, and opportunity for every
Georgia. Today we gather to officially kick off Black History Month by unveiling
the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus, because Black Caucus is 2026
legislative priorities. Priority shaped directly by the voices, needs, and
lived experiences of people that we served.
In October 2025, members of the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus identified legislative initiatives
and critical to constituents.
The Georgia Legislative Black Caucus members are committed to supporting legislation that
focuses on these combined members responses.
justice in access to wealth. That includes protection and aid for black land owners and
their heirs. Expand contracts and access to credit for minority-owned businesses. Advocate
for the use of a percentage of the surplus to strengthen economic growth. And lastly
to increase the minimum wage.
Our next priority health access and equity,
expand health care options based on income eligibility,
expand options for maternal health care,
requirement for prostate screening, protections,
and increase options for rural Georgians,
more than adequate funding for mitigating food deserts,
and ensuring school-aged children
and their vulnerable populations are properly nourished.
Our next priority will be housing access.
As we know, housing is probably one of the top issues
that I keep hearing.
So we want to advance fair housing initiatives
in dismantle barriers that perpetuate
residential segregation.
Eliminate source of income discrimination in Georgia
including a source of income as protected class in Georgia in the Fair Housing
Statute. Established tenant protections and create eviction standards statewide.
Protect homeowners from selective discriminatory enforcement by HOAs.
Next we have voting and civil rights. Supporting consistency in election
administration across all 159 counties in the state of Georgia.
Increased civic participation through standard K through 12 initiatives.
Ensure the proper funding is in place for counties to run their elections.
Mandate that counties serve as centralized election administrators for
municipal elections. Clear audit authority and transparency measures for the
Secretary of State. Next, we have education. Prioritize expansion of funding for K-12. Prioritize
expansion of funding for HBCUs. Create extensive workforce pipelines, and a continued focus to
expand early literacy programs. Next is criminal, just criminal justice reform, excuse me.
Trust-based policing and public safety standards to support constitutional and
judicial protections for all Georgians. We will continue to uplift reentry
projects that support jobs, housing, and stability to cut recidivism. At the heart
of our agenda is a clear and urgent commitment protecting civil and
and constitutional rights while expanding access
to economic opportunity.
Quality health, safe and affordable housing,
strong educational pipelines,
and a comprehensive criminal justice reform.
Additionally, as current events threaten
the safety of Georgians,
the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus
will stand in the gap.
The GOBC's priorities are not theoretical.
They are community driven, evidence-based,
and rooted in the realities facing families across Georgia.
Central to this work is our full support
of the Georgia Civil Rights Act of 2026.
That's going to be, that is House Bill 670
and Senate Bill 320.
This legislation represents a cornerstone of our agenda
and a necessary step to close gaps in protection,
strengthen accountability, and ensure that civil rights
in Georgia are not optional, but are guaranteed.
Today, we will hear from legislative leaders
and community voices who will speak to the urgency
of this moment, the Legal and Moral Foundation
of this work, and the collective action required
to move these priorities forward.
This is about more than policy.
It's about power protection and legacy.
It is about connecting legislation to the lives of people.
The Georgia Legislative Black Caucus exists
more than just during the legislative session.
We are committed to leading Georgia 365 days a year.
To keep up and follow our work,
please visit us at www.GeorgiaBlackCockets.org.
Thank you for being here.
We look forward to working together.
Oh, I'm going to call up Representative Clark and she will be introducing and speaking
on House Bill 670, our civil rights legislation.
Thank you so much Madam Chair.
Again, my name is Dr. Jasmine Clark and I represent Georgia's House District 108, which
is located in the Lillburn area of Gwyneth County and I am the sponsor of House
Bill 670 or the Civil Rights Act of 2026. In a state that produced prominent
civil rights leaders like Martin Luther King and John Lewis, Andrew Young and
Josea Williams, and so many others, it is actually shameful that the state of
Georgia has less protections against discrimination than some of our Southern
neighbors like Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas. For example, at the state
level in Georgia, there is no law barring discrimination due to race or religion
in public places. The same is also true for employment in the state of Georgia.
There is no state-level law that protects people.
And in both of these instances, a person does have federal protections,
but having to fight for your civil rights at the federal level can be intimidating,
it can be expensive, and it can feel out of reach for so many Georgians.
Additionally, this bill will require the state of Georgia to collect data on racial profiling
and traffic stops by law enforcement.
Believe it or not, once again Georgia is behind other southern states in this endeavor.
As this is already done in states like Texas and Louisiana, North Carolina and Virginia.
We as a nation are watching the unraveling of civil rights happen right before our eyes
all across the country.
We have top level officials in this country that are attacking diversity, equity and inclusion
as if they are dirty words.
We have people at both the state and federal level that have been doing all that they
they can to deny, rewrite, or just straight up remove
an accurate telling of our nation's history.
The Civil Rights Act of 2026 is a reminder
that freedom is always a work in progress.
It's like a group project that we all
must participate in in order to make our state a better place
for everyone to live and to protect the rights
of all who call our state home.
And so that is why I am pushing
the Georgia Civil Rights Act of 2026, House Bill 960.
Thank you.
Thank you so much hey you didn't ever know I was like hey back it off oh there you go
get afternoon thank you for saying that I do appreciate it because this is a great afternoon
to talk about what Georgians need.
Hi, my name is Christopher Bruce.
I am the deputy executive director
for the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia,
an organization that is dedicated to defending your civil rights
and liberties in this state.
Now, I have prepared remarks, but state representative
Jasmine Clark did so well laying out
the comprehensive civil rights bill.
I'm going to take up from what she had said.
and really emphasize and talk directly to the people
about what's happening right now.
Your rights are being trampled on.
I don't know another way of saying that.
You have an administration that is literally killing people
in the streets without any type of accountability.
You have a time when journalists are being arrested,
Your entire constitution is at stake.
You do have state protections in other states.
But for some reason, in the birthplace of our civil rights,
the home of Dr. Martin Luther King,
we are woefully behind here in the state of Georgia.
Welfly behind our other southern states,
especially when it deals with public accommodations,
when it deals with housing,
and it would deal with other racial justice issues.
So laying out a very simple, plain language,
Georgia comprehensive civil rights bill will do what?
It will give you the rights that you deserve.
The rights that have already been enshrined of you
on the federal level, but guess what?
You cannot depend on your federal government anymore.
There have been so many changes that have been happening
with this administration.
If you do not understand that, it's too late.
You must demand from your state senators
and your state representatives
to pass the Georgia comprehensive civil rights bill
and you have to demand that they pass it now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Good afternoon, good afternoon. My name is John Moe. I'm the Senior Director for Policy
at the Urban League of Greater Atlanta. And we're here today because of the fierce urgency
of now. I stand here today on behalf of the Urban League alongside the Georgia Legislative
black caucus at a moment that calls for clarity, courage and collective action. We're here
because civil rights in Georgia cannot be taken for granted. This must be protected,
strengthened and advanced, not only by the leaders standing behind these microphones, but
by you the people whose lives and future depends on the laws passed under this gold dome.
Today I want to speak directly to our community. This time, this is the time to mobilize. This
This is a time to stand publicly and unapologetically in support of a strong civil rights bill for
all Georgians.
This is a time to make it clear that discrimination has no place in our state.
Not in housing, not in employment, not in public accommodation, not anywhere.
Thank you.
By passing this bill, it won't happen by hope alone.
will happen by through action, through you, through us, through we the people.
I urge every Georgian who believes in fairness and dignity to contact your state legislators.
Tell them you expect them to protect your rights, your family, and your future.
Tell them you are watching, that we are watching, and you will remember, you will remember
who stood on the side of justice.
Show up at committee hearings.
Your presence in these rooms matter.
And lawmakers see roles of constituent students and parents and business people and faith leaders.
They understand that this is not an abstract policy debate.
This is about real people.
Us, we, the people, real lives in real consequences.
So I ask you to educate your neighbors, educate your networks, talk about what this bill
does, why it matters, and what's at stake.
Saving engagement is not a one-time act.
It's a culture.
We build together.
This is how we protect our communities,
it's how we honor those who fought before us.
Civil engagement is power,
civil engagement is protection,
and civil engagement is legacy.
Now is the time to act.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
All right.
And with that, we are done.
I don't think we took up too much of your time.
But just to be clear,
comprehensive civil rights legislation. This is a bipartisan issue and it is
absolutely something both of these chambers can come together and work on. So
with that I'm going to open it up to questions for anybody that might have any.
Okay, oh yeah the house probably we have not taken a position on it yet as a
caucus but we will be looking at that legislation to see how it impacts our
communities you know we're we're always concerned with how it's gonna impact
black communities. So once we take a look at that, we will put out a statement on how we
feel about that legislation.
Yes. He was asking about the property tax bill, not the income tax bill.
my overall message was your first question yes our overall message my overall our our our
caucuses overall messages let's work on those policies that actually address the the issues
that Black Georgians are care about.
I think our comprehensive civil rights legislation is kind of one of our key pieces of legislation.
So my message there is, hey, all my colleagues on both side of the aisle, please work with
us to pass that legislation.
There is no reason we should have it.
What was your second?
Right. So that's coalition building with a lot of our advocacy groups. Yes, we absolutely
need to raise the minimum wage. Companies are, you know, are making all of the money yet
workers don't have enough money to even live. So that is again is another policy that
I would love to have bipartisan support for her, and it's no reason we should not have
already raised the minimum wage.
People are having trouble just buying groceries, you know, child care we know as an issue.
You know, we have some tariffs, some bad policy on tariffs that are affecting people's
affordability, and of course we do have a housing crisis to where people, there's not
enough housing and what's out there people can't afford it.
So I think raising the minimum wage would kind of stop the bleeding and help there, so
So I look for bipartisan support on that.
There's no reason why we shouldn't have legislation raised
in minimum wages this time.
Yeah.
So we can see some of the election bills
in our policy.
We're going to need policy specifically
to get the concerns out of you.
And those bills are going on in the end of March.
How is the end of March?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think we're seeing again, our policy is always,
as the Georgia Legislative Act caucus,
is protect voting rights, full stop.
We know we have a history of our ancestors
before us, fighting for voting rights.
We want to continue to adhere to that fight,
to make sure that we are protecting voting rights.
And then the other part of your specific terms,
about the post is to line up in the park, zero rights.
Yeah, so the only thing I'm going to say about,
we don't know, I guess the concern right now
is how much is that going to cost
and is that the right policy right now?
I think we're already in the 2026 election.
I think trying to roll that back at this time
is concerning, as well as we don't know the overall effects
and we don't even have a fiscal note
about how much this will cost.
So that is another piece of legislation
that we'll be looking at closely
and we will make a statement.
Yes.
We support black businesses, full stop.
Whether that be hemp legislation, we support black farmers.
So I think full stop for the legislative black caucus.
We would be supportive.
We haven't digested all the legislation that's out there,
But I would say at this time that that is our goal to always support black businesses and black farmers
Yes
So the full county delegation will be taking the lead on that I can tell you right
Right now that we are concerned as this is a voting rights type of bill and any attacks
on our election and setups to interfere with our election, we take very seriously in
this legislature and we are asking our colleagues on both sides to take these attacks very seriously
because this was just full and county today but this could happen in anyone's county.
All right.
Okay, thank you all for joining us.
