We made it till Friday, Super Bowl weekend coming up.
I hope the Lord lets me live long enough to see the Falcons and it one more time, but
I don't know.
We will begin our day with Scripture reading in prayer by the Chaplain after which we will
pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 145th House District
Representative Rick Williams, Representative Williams.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning. Gives me great pleasure to not only bring a pastor
to you this morning, but also a friend, more like a brother. Reverend Larry Glover walked
him my office in 1976 and said, I'm here to help you run Amlitt's service. I had just
24 years old and got the contract to run Amlitt's service for Baldwin County. He was a student
at Georgia College. We were both kids. Didn't have a clue what we were doing. But we worked
seven days a week, 24 hours a day. Larry, not a stranger to the Capitol. His father
There was Jim Glover, who was a warehouse manager for Tom Erwin when he was over the Department
of Agriculture.
His niece Shannon Wallace is a district attorney over in Cherokee County and Larry and I
could probably write a book and make a couple of movies over the ambulance calls that we
have run together in CPR and wrecks and drunks and even had a few died from lead poisoning
and he wasn't drinking lead, it was a shooting lead.
But anyway, I'm just honored to present him this morning.
Thank you all for being here.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I'm supposed to say, Representative Williams, but I'm not.
I'm going to say Rick because he is my brother.
And thank you to the mums of the house for allowing me to be here today.
When I was a boy, my father's office was across the street in agriculture building.
There was a guy named Mr. Forward that was with the building authority.
And if Mr. Forward found out that Dad was bringing my brother and I to Atlanta, he came
got us and he brought us over to the Capitol.
I was able to walk in when you were not in session in this room and never had any idea that
I would be able to come and speak before you today.
Now on one of those trips I went into an office here.
The gentleman was in a wheelchair, and he was our secretary of state.
His name was Mr. Ben Forson, and since I was only about 40 pions then, Mr. Ben picked
me up, set me on his lap, and pointed to a lover sofa as I remember being in his office,
and he said, let me tell you about the day that Georgia had two governors.
He said, I slept right there on that sofa and slept on the state seals so no business
could be taken care of.
He pointed out the features of that state seal and there are three words in there, I want
to bring to your attention today, wisdom, justice, and moderation.
Some ladies, I've got good news for you.
You've got someone you can depend on.
His name is God.
First of all, wisdom is knowing the right way, knowing what to do.
When Rick was first elected, I saw him trying to learn the ropes.
He asked a lot of questions.
He's made a lot of friends and I've got to stop and say that I am very proud of him.
And our work together over the years has been one thing that we've tried to do, look to
the Lord, do it right, do what He would have us do.
Justice is not only knowing the right thing, but doing the right thing.
There's no gray areas.
It is said of King David in Scripture, and David reigned over all of Israel, and David
executed judgment and justice to all people. Doing the right thing. God gave us a
standard. It's real simple. The laws that you passed today are based on the laws
that God gave us. It's found in Exodus 20. Ten little verses is called the Ten
Commandments. Do wash right. And then the last word today in our state motto that
is guided this nation to greatness, to be a shining light in the United States of America
as to what a state should be is moderation.
I like to say that moderation is living the right way.
When my father brought me to the Capitol and in his whole life, he always tried to teach
just now look. There's somebody watching it. He would try to teach us, now son, your
word is your bond. He taught us that there is one way to live, and that's the right way.
I walked in the door this morning, and I could hear His voice. I walked in the door this
morning and I had so many memories of so many things that's going on in Georgia and I've
got to say that this house of representatives is one of the strongest that I've ever seen
and I'm proud of you.
Let's continue to live our lives in such a way that when our grandchildren, our great-grandchildren,
And when history says that you have done a good job and you have done the right thing,
let's pray.
Lord God, we come before you today to ask for your strength, your wisdom, your guidance,
At everything we accomplish this day, we will bring glory and honor to you, blessings
to this state, our nation, and the people that have sent us here.
Protect us, O Lord, provide for us, and keep us in your will, for we pray in Jesus' name,
amen.
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which
it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
Doorkeepers will unlock the doors.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Today we celebrate the birthday of a world-class athlete,
a World War II veteran, and a generous Georgian.
Jack Roosevelt Robinson, known as Jackie Robinson,
he was born in Cairo, Georgia, in 1919
to a family of sharecroppers and grew up
to be the first baseball player to break Major League
baseball's color barrier that segregated the sport
for more than 50 years.
His jersey number, number 42, is regarded
is one of the most famous numbers in baseball history.
In 10 seasons, he had a high batting average of 311,
and his on-base percentage was 409.
He led the Dodgers to six world series
and one world series championship in a 10-year span.
He was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1962,
his first year of eligibility, and is an NAACP prestigious
spring guard, a medalist.
Although he was a great baseball player,
His character and willingness to stand up for change
is what he is best known for.
We are proud in Cairo that our boys and girls club
carries his name and where his ideals are carried on.
Jackie Robinson is hailed as one of the best baseball players
of all time and American civil rights hero.
Let us all take this day to celebrate
this extraordinary Georgian's accomplishments in life.
Happy birthday, Jackie Robinson.

Chair recognizes Chairman Newton for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Colleagues, disappointing facts,
was determined during our study committee on maternal mortality.
Well, one of the intriguing things,
That's where Georgia ranks very high in that.
One of the intriguing things, though,
is 60% of the pregnancy-related deaths
are potentially preventable.
That was one of the highlights that we determined.
And the 41% of Georgians and many of our African-American
citizens are especially high risk for maternal mortality.
You all know that study committees
during our off-season provide an opportunity for us
to learn, for us to study what's going on in our state.
They also provide a spotlight on all
different organizations that are working. I will tell you, our multiple meetings we had on
maternal mortality did shine a spotlight on some great people and organizations that are working
across Georgia to improve our standing in maternal mortality. Some of these like our people at the
Department of Public Health, our maternal mortality review committee that's been working for several
years established by our speaker in this body. One of the others is Healthy Mother's Healthy Babies,
one that I'm especially proud of as I co-chaired the committee with who healthy mothers healthy babies
as determined was their advocate of the year for 2019 and that was Chairman Sharon Cooper.
We heard from providers all over the state who gave us great suggestions on how we can improve
outcomes for these mothers in every zip code in our state. I want to encourage us to continue
to work as legislators as fellow legislators to ensure we prioritize the health of mothers
their children and ensure that all Georgians are educated on their health care options available to
them and that they each have the access to quality health care that they deserve. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes representative McCloud.
In this budget, we will be contributing to mass incarceration by decreasing the budget
to the departments that will provide resources for employment and rehabilitation by almost
$57 million at this time in the United States of America that leads in prison population
even though it accounts for less than 5% of the world's population.
With this budget, we are supposed to face our constituents and tell them that this budget
is a reflection of what we value, I think not.
In this year, in this session, in this room, we can create a budget that benefits the people
who we serve, our employers, the people of the state of Georgia, they deserve a return
on their investment, I yield the well.
Chair recognizes representative Carter for a morning order, going once, twice, all right,
Chair recognizes representative Wynn to introduce the doctor of the day.
