Hello and welcome to the Georgia Senate Page Program. If you're interested in serving as a page
but don't know where to start, welcome. My name is Skye. I'm 13 years old and I am thrilled to
tell you about what you can expect from your day under the Gold Dome.
To serve as a Senate Page for a day, the first step is a contactor seized senator
and let them know you're interested in participating. The state senator, the
represents your county, city or neighborhood will be your sponsor for today. If you don't know
Who your state senator is, click the pop-up in the corner to learn.
After that, you can go to the Georgia General Assembly website,
click the Senate Members page and find our contact information,
complete the page, interest form, and send it to your senator's administrative assistant.
The Georgia Senate welcomes those of disabilities to serve as pages.
Please notify your sponsoring senator's office if you require any special accommodations during
your time at the capital. For a written breakdown of the sign-up process, check out the page Welcome Packet
here. Be sure to check the convening time of the floor session by visiting the Senate schedule the
night before you page. You should plan to arrive an hour and a half before the start time for that day.
When you arrive, report to the page director at this desk on the third floor of the capital
building directly across from the senate chamber.
Only a handful of people can enter the senate chamber, senators, senate staff, credentialed
press, and pages.
Your job is a page where we deliver messages from constituents outside the chamber to the
senators inside the chamber.
Not just your sponsoring senator, but any of the 56 senators.
When you enter the Senate Chamber, you'll deliver the message that the Senator listed
on the yellow slip of paper.
You'll use this map to find the Senator and the Senate Chamber.
When delivering your message, do not walk down the center aisle.
That is meant for Senators only.
Instead you'll use the side aisles, locate your Senator, and place the message under desk.
For any reason you cannot find the Senator,
then please return your sub-paper back to the page director.
The use of any kind of cell phones,
tablets, or other electronic devices
is prohibited while paging.
Remember, professionalism is key.
You're representing your school, your neighborhood,
as well as the Senate page program.
Speaking of professionalism is important to dress
for the occasion, business or business casual.
Just sure it's dress pants or kneeling skirts are appropriate.
If you think something may not be appropriate, it probably isn't.
Finally, be sure to wear comfortable shoes as you'll be walking around quite a bit.
You will also have the opportunity to have your photo taken with the lieutenant governor
and your sponsoring senator at some point during the legislative day.
The page director will give you instructions on when the picture will be taken,
but generally, this happens right before lunchtime,
so make sure you check in with your page directors before you leave the eat.
When the Legislative Day is ended, you will report to the page desk to receive your certificate, payment, and letter excusing you from school.
Thank you so much for your service to the Georgia Senate. We hope this experience has inspired you to Monday pursue a role in public service.
On behalf of the City of Georgia and the Georgia State Senate, thank you so much for your role in the lawmaking process.
