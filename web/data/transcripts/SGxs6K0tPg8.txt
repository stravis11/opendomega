TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good morning. Yes, community midwives are here. Right here in Georgia. They're
well trained community midwives practicing their ancient craft. Midwifeery is a
proven model of care for safety and needs to be more accessible in Georgia. So I
So I say hello and good morning to you all.
I extend my gratitude to my friends, family, colleagues,
constituents, and everyone gathered here today.
Even in the spirit world, my grandmother was a midwife.
And my great grandmother were both midwives.
So I'm proud and honored to stand here with our modern day
midwives and I want to shed life light on the valuable role of midwives and
the pressing need to recognize their significance in our healthcare system.
Yes, midwives are compassionate caregivers, advocates for health care,
guardians for mothers and newborns and pillars of support during one of
most beautiful journeys. To do this, they undergo rigorous training, often spending three to five years.
They are equipped to handle countless emergencies during childbirth, offering care,
that prioritizes maternal well-being and safety.
This is crucial in addressing racial disparities
in maternal health, where black women face
alarming rates of complications and mortality,
suppressing even some nations in the world,
Studies show that midwifery led care results in lower rates of interventions like sea sections
and infant mortality, offering a cost-effective alternative to hospital-based care.
Historically, communities rely on midwife expertise, particularly among black and immigrant
populations. However, the shift towards hospital-based care in the 20th century led
a decline in the number of midwives from 43,000 in the 1980s to around 14,000 today.
We need more, not less, so in 2015 Georgia granted the board of nursing, the authority
to regulate mid-wifery practices, mandating a nursing license for mid-wifes.
This decision mirrored across the southeast, limited the scope of mid-wifery, and hindered
access to care for many communities leading to less than 200 midwives in Georgia today.
However, 40 states, including recent additions like Mississippi and Alabama, have moved
away from such restrictive measures, recognizing the unique expertise of midwives beyond nursing
qualifications. Revitalizing midwifery not only addresses health care disparities, but
also alleviates shortage shortages in rural areas. Now midwifery education is more accessible
and cost effective than traditional nursing programs offering a sustainable solution
to workforce shortages.
Yes, it is time for Georgia to follow the lead of other states
and facilitate easier pathways for midwives
to provide the expert care that they are trained for.
As the Bible speaks to us about the importance of midwives,
and their immense value in the childbirth process
In the book of Psalms, chapter 22, verse 11, it says,
do not be far from me, for trouble is near.
And there is no one to help.
It's true, we would be lost without the help
of so many Georgia midwives, right?
Yes.
So once again, thank you all
So being here today during this very special occasion, we thank you and may God bless you all.
We are presenting a 2024 legislation on the floor today of the Senate.
So I look forward to seeing you up in the chamber and remember in room 125 and room 125 there's
