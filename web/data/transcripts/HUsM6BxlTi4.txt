Joining us is Republican Senator Jason Dickerson from Senate District 21,
representing portions of Cherokee and Fulton Counties. His committees include
banking and financial institutions, public safety, government oversight and veterans,
military and homeland security. Also here is Democratic Senator Jaha Howard of Smirna,
who represents parts of Cobb and Fulton Counties. His committees include agriculture and
and consumer affairs, government oversight, higher education, and state and local government
operations.
Welcome to Lawmakers, to your first time.
Thank you.
We're going to have you back, of course.
So we'll get to know you a little bit better.
And I'm going to start with you, Senator Dickerson.
Tell us a bit about yourself.
You co-founded, among other things, an overhaul, a long haul, Trump Trump company, a long
haul trucking.
People out there for a long time on it.
That is correct.
Yes, ma'am.
It was some of the lifelong resident,
Cherokee County, started my first company
when I was 15 years old, which was a transportation company.
By the time I graduated, I had five employees.
Over the years, I've had about 22 different companies,
the smallest five employees, the largest 550 employees.
Again, just love the community of Cherokee County,
love North Fulton, and just love everything about it.
It's been an absolute honor.
That first one, was it bikes and transportation?
What was it?
It actually, it was a three car hauler.
I can't transport cars back to Florida.
Oh, wow, at 15 years old.
Let's talk a little bit about one of the bills
that deals with trucking that you are looking to introduce
really soon on CDL driver's license.
That is correct, unfortunately.
That is correct, the driver's license.
And so one of the things that we've kind of seen here
in the public over the last several years
is that we've had some accidents
and some of those drivers, for the most part,
They may not have been able to speak English
or even read English.
A lot of times they've been able to drop the truck.
And so one of the bills I'm looking to introduce
is that if you're a non-US citizen
and you're here on a visa,
then your driver's license will aspire
the same date that your visa expires,
which is not currently the case.
Okay, well we'll find out more about that
once you drop that bill.
All right, Senator Howard,
let's learn more about you, you're a dentist,
and you also served on a Cobb County board for a time.
What's about that a little bit?
Well, yeah, I'm a pediatric dentist in Vinenings, I grew up in Atlanta, Mays High School, I'm
a church deacon in Bible study teacher in the city of South Poulton, and I live in Smyrna,
and it's just excited about representing all of those wonderful parts of the district
35.
Okay, well, I have you.
There's something that came out with the EPA today dealing with investigating, looking
at what is going on with fluoride and water.
We know that the recent administration is making a lot of changes based on sometimes
outsized fears, and some there's some legitimate conversations that we have to have with
the public.
What I try to tell our parents, and the same thing with our constituents, is that there's
a difference between water flow ride, topical flow ride, like toothpaste, and supplements.
But oftentimes when we're in a political warfare, people are just using words and using terms
and throwing them around for a political gain.
We need to make sure we're trusting our medical professionals, our dental professionals
to have that more nuanced conversation.
So the topical kind is the kind we may see in what to face than that kind of thing.
And it has wonderful benefits.
We do want to have a more nuanced conversation about systemic fluoride.
Okay.
We've been talking about this bill dealing with lab-grown meat.
That is correct.
And tell us what that's all about, much above all.
Well, so it's, you know, this is something that came forth by one of my constituents.
And every year, you know, what we've looked at is, of course, I always have things that
are passionate to myself and my family.
But at the same time, I always want to do what's best for the people in my district.
And this is one of those items that came up.
And it just made a lot of sense all the way around.
You know, and-
So what's the part that makes sense?
Are we want to ban it?
I do want to ban it.
And so, you know, right now is the FDA basically approved this in 2023.
Since then, we have seven states that have banned
the production, distribution, and sale of lab
creative meat.
Here in the South East, we have Texas, Mississippi,
Alabama, and Florida that have all banded as well.
Wow.
And so at this point, it's basically taking a little bit
of animal stem cells and that kind of thing,
and making meat out of it.
That is correct.
And right.
And, uh, and, and, and pork.
And chicken.
And that is correct.
That is correct, yes ma'am.
Wow.
So your, your bill, you, you feel pretty good about it.
You said it's a talker.
It is a talker.
It's not one of the things I thought
would get a lot of press on,
but the last couple of days in the media,
it is definitely take it off.
Okay, well, we're gonna find out how that goes.
Let's switch gears a little bit to another talker.
And that's data centers.
You have interest in a bill
and introducing a bill dealing with data centers.
Tell us about it.
Very much so our campaign ended mid-December
and it was one of the number one conversations
that data centers.
A lot of people are just now finding out
what data centers are.
When we have a conversation, no matter if they're a 20-something year old or 80-something year old,
when they realize we have just blocks and blocks and blocks of warehouses full of servers
that are going to be in your backyard, people want to have a deeper conversation.
They want to understand that connection between what the data centers are in our water, our
noise pollution, energy is the big one, so people want to have a real conversation.
So on the campaign trail, we talked about pausing data centers for one year.
It's not that we're anti-progress, we want to welcome progress, we want to welcome technology.
But just like with the conversation about lab-grown meat, technology is great, but we can't
do anything without trust.
And I think we can all agree that the trust in our institutions is at an all-time low.
And if we want to do wonderful things with technology, but we can't do it without public
trust, let's take a pause.
Let's make sure that we're educating one another, let's know what we're walking into.
not just have a short-term goal, but what's our meeting and long-term goal for data centers?
Okay, before we're breading out of time, but I want to get something in that it is important.
We talked about tort reform and all last year a lot in the legislature.
You want to do something with insurance reform?
Well, specifically for me, it comes down to a property tax reform from that standpoint.
And for me, you know, it's just like in District 21, as in the rest of the state, I mean,
We've seen astronomical property increases,
a lot of property tax increases over the last four to five years.
And we've just become unsustainable for anybody
that's in the district, whether you're in the South Georgia,
whether you're in North Georgia, it doesn't matter.
So we definitely want to look at some property tax reform
this year, and we've already put forth one bill
to help the people in Cherokee County District 21.
Okay, and real quick, tell us about your interest
in education, and because you've been
on the Cup County School Board,
what are you interested in seeing happen?
Yeah, I think folks will be surprised
that our funding formula is 40 years old.
And we've tinkered around the edges.
We're barely making progress.
We've had many years where we've underfunded
our public education.
And oftentimes we're quick to demonize our public schools.
We need real champions for public education
and also make sure that we're leaving room
for some creativity through our public charters.
I'm not a big fan of running over to private education.
We wanna make sure that no matter where you are in Georgia,
you want your public schools,
where they're a traditional public,
or public charter schools to be strong.
Okay.
Well, how's it going so far real quick?
Oh, it's been great.
You like it?
It's been fantastic.
It's been good.
Well, I'll ask you that.
Yeah, have us back in a few weeks.
And you're soft.
All right, thank you so much for coming to us.
Thank you, Donna.
Appreciate it.
