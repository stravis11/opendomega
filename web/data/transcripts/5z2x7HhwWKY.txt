All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber, and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines. Thank you all for being here. Doorkeepers, please close the doors and keep them closed. As our custom, we will begin our day with script reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain is special. We're glad he's with us. A dear friend from the state's borough, he will be introduced a little better than what I just did in just a second, but he will be introduced by the gentleman from the 160th House District Representative, Lehman Franklin. Representative Franklin. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It is my pleasure to introduce to you one of Bullet County's finest, Pastor Donald Chavers Jr. Pastor Chavers is a senior pastor for a Goppe worship center in St. Petersburg, Georgia, but in reality, I'd say that his church is the entire community. He's everywhere and he's involved in everything. That's why I say St. Petersburg is his pulpit, because everywhere he goes, he shares the love of God, and as that famous quote goes, preached the gospel on all occasions, and when necessary, use words. I think this defines Pastor Chavers. He is a man of peace. He is a man of honor. He is a man of integrity. He is a man that I am happy to be able to call my friend. Please help me welcome Pastor Donald Chavers. Thank you. Speaker. Representative. Daily devotional. In relation to six and ten says, therefore, as you have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers. So many of us live our lives in small circles, not noticing the big picture. We enjoy the luxuries of being who we are in, all the privileges and amenities that come along with living our lives. While doing so, we only see a microscopic vision of life. It's amazing how many people prefer to read only the caption and fail to be engrossed in the bigger picture of things. It's dumb-founding to the least. Basically, we sometimes become entrapped by the word me. It becomes what I want or what I need. In other words, this art process involves into me helping me as a terrible mentality. Using these lens, since we fall, fail to see the bigger picture. We fail to notice that God has blessed us, those of us here in this room, with abilities and talents that others simply just don't have. But they are just. Are they just for us? Or all of these great abilities and talents just for us? For our comfort? Is it just for us to enjoy? No, there's a bigger picture. There's a bigger picture. That's why we have to come to the knowledge of the fact that we're all God's children when we're enjoying the same world together. Therefore, this is why we should practice awareness we need to stop, refocus, remind ourselves that we all share something in common. One DNA, we all have to die. We all have needs. And we all need acknowledgement. Today, we accept the fact that we're not in this world alone. It's basically somewhere around 7.7 billion people that share this space with us. We need to pay attention to the essential needs of others. We need to allow our eyes to be open. I want to share something with you an experience that I had. One day I was sitting in a coffee shop, their own main street. Lehman, you can appreciate this. The blue mile. I was sitting in a coffee, staring out the window, reading, while reading Galatian 6n, as I sat, I glanced out the window and noticed a couple walking on sidewalk. It was a lady and a guy, the lady had a limb. When she walked, she walked with a limb. And the guy who was fully functional, he took large strides and it kept him out in front of her. This is what got my attention. Every time he got so far ahead of her, he would look back, turn and go and assist her. He would take the bags that she was carrying one at a time. He turned so many times until eventually he was carrying all of the bags. All along, they were laughing and having the greatest time. But as I was reading, it made it come alive. Galatians 6, it made it come alive. Barry, he won another's burdens. And so fulfilled the law of Christ. Moreover, I saw Galatians 6 and 10 in action. Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people. We can do that. If we lift our heads up out of our story long enough to see the bigger picture. This is something that has guided my life. As I've been a minister, it's the old him. It says, a charge to keep I have, a God to glorify a never dying soul to see and fit it for the sky. To serve this President, my calling to fulfill. Oh, me and all my power engage. Just to do my master's will. Army with jealous care has in thy sight to live. And now thy servant, Lord, prepare a strict account to give. Help me to watch and pray. As in thy sight to live. Oh, let me now trust. Let me now knock thy trust betray. But press to round on high. It is my prayer that everyone in this chamber would understand that you have a charge to keep and a God to glorify. Let us pray. God of heaven, we thank you for this body. We are so grateful that they have the heart to serve servants. And pray now that you would guide their thoughts. And should there be any bitterness?

It's in their hearts. I pray that you would massage it to release it so that they may think clearly as they guide Georgia. Oh God bless America. This land. I love it because I live here. Bless us. Keep us in your cares. May Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. Thank you, ma'am. Well, we just rely on the United States on our own and through the Republic, we will stand for the nation on our own rock in the vegetable with unity and justice for all. Awesome. We can start by getting tech-photo. So just hold. The doorkeepers will unlock the doors. Members, you may greet Reverend Shavers in the south any room and take a photo if you like. I'll just tell you all this. I know he has a powerful voice speaking voice. We're going to have him back one day. He's going to sing a little bit for us. Beautiful voice. Chair recognizes Chairman Tarvan, the chair of the Committee on Information and Audits. Chairman Tarvan. Mr. Speaker, your Committee on Information and Audits has read the journals and the previous legislative day and found it to be correct. And on another note, Mr. Speaker, if we always tell the truth, we don't have to remember what we told everybody. Now that's a powerful message. Since my memory's bad, I do try to tell the truth 100% of the time. Make a good effort at it. Thank you, Chairman Tarvan. Is there any objection to dispense with the reading of the journal?

Dr. Emerson is a board certified urologist member of the American urological association fellow of the American College of Surgeons member of the American Medical Association and a board member of the Cobb County Medical Society. He's a graduate of Georgia State University attended the medical college of Georgia and received his medical degree in 1983. He then finished two years of general surgery training at the Medical Center of Central Georgia and Macon followed by four years of urology training at the Oshner Clinic in New Orleans.

He's been very active in the Medical Association of Georgia. In 2006 he was appointed to the Mag Board and he's been very active in leadership. His practice was acquired by Wellstar in 2014 where he is now employed. Dr. Emerson lives in Marietta with his wife Christi who teaches at Kennesaw State University School of Nursing. They have three adult children and three granddaughters with the fourth due in November. Thank you so much, Dr. Emerson for being our doctor of the day. Thank you, Representative Williams, and we are very grateful to Dr. Emerson for taking his precious time to be with us today. So thank you, Dr. Emerson. We do appreciate it. We have several more morning orders. I'm not going to hold you to exactly two minutes. We have a little bit of flexibility but to keep everything moving today, we'll hold you about two minutes. So we'll start... we'll start morning orders with Representative Doreen Carter for morning order. And friends. Good morning. Thank you, Ms. Lee. Two many friends for me to name. Two many friends. I think everyone could join us this morning. Thank you, again, Mrs. Speaker. Today is Go Red for Women, Women at the Georgia State Capitol. First, I'd like to acknowledge our friends in a gallery from the American Heart Association. If you would stand and if you all would stand. And members, if we will welcome, thank you all for your work. And we have a group downstairs in 230 that is currently doing blood pressure checks if you need that and CPR demonstration. So cardiovascular disease is the world's leading cause of preventable death and disability. And as a global public health crisis of our generation as supporting the recognition of February 2023 as American Heart Month. Cardiovascular disease is also the single leading cause of death in Georgia. Accounting for more than 22,000 deaths a year. This is about one in three deaths overall. Cardiovascular disease, which includes stroke, claimed the life of a woman about every 80 seconds, but about every... But about 80% of cardiovascular disease may be prevented, given you some other statistics. In 2015, cardiovascular disease accounted for $555 billion in healthcare expenditures and lost productivity. And is expected by 2035 cardiovascular disease will account for $1 trillion in healthcare and expenditure loss. As I said, cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death and it also is preventable. So I want to encourage everyone to join us in eating healthy, exercising, drinking more water. And for those of you who say I'm not giving up my meats, I'm saying don't give up your meats. Just eat more vegetables. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We yield the well. Thank you, colleagues.

And I welcome and thank you for all you have done. Thank you.

The chair now recognizes Ripsett, Chairman LeHood, Corbett, Birchette, and Sharper for a morning order. Y'all have a big time last night, guys. That was some good food. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And thank you for coming to our bird supper last night, Mr. Speaker. And all of you, we had a wonderful turnout last night at the Lounge County bird supper. Our shoulders are sore from shooting all those birds. So I hope you did enjoy them. And I wanted to recognize, and the Lounge County delegation wants to recognize leadership lounge, a great group of professionals from Lounge County. If you would stand up, I would have recognized you today. Thank you for being here. We thank you for coming all the way up from South Georgia to see what's going on in the people's house and wish you a wonderful day today and a safe ride home. So thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yes, safe travels back home. Glad to have you all with us. Okay, members, you guys look like you all have a morning order. Y'all have one, do you? After the afternoon order, you got to wait a while for that. Just a little while. We'll now move on to the rules calendar. Mr. Clerk, the clerk will read the caption to House Bill 18. House Bill 18, members and adjourns on 159. House Bill 1847, the administration of 104th and hatchet of the 155th, a bill to be entitled an act to amend the act, making and providing appropriations for the state fiscal year beginning July 1st, 2022, and ending June 30th, 2023, known as the General Appropriations Act. This bill I'm referring to the committee on appropriations, that committee recommends that this bill do pass. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, the chair resolves the House into a committee of the whole House for the purpose of considering House Bill 18, the supplemental appropriations bill. The chair appoints the gentleman of the 104th Majority Leader of the Estration as chairman to preside over the committee of the whole House. Mr. Majority Leader. Chair recognizes the gentleman from the 155th Representative Matt Hatchett to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Bring me some votes, Al. I'm bearing with me. I got about an hour and a half worth of comments, so hope you all can hang around and enjoy the fun. Today I bring you House Bill 18, the amended fiscal year 2023 budget. It's set by revenue estimate of $32.56 billion in increase of $2.36 billion or 7.8% of the original FY23 budget. This is the second year in a row. The state has experienced tremendous growth in this amended budget. Our state has a long history of conservative fiscal management and this year is no exception. With the additional funds that are being recognized in this budget, the House joins the governor on the wise use of tax dollars with one time needed investments in technology and capital projects, safety and security projects, economic development projects, as well as human capital investment. Recognizing that the amended budget presents an opportunity to capture funds that will not be utilized in the current year by one department that can be used in another, we found one time savings or true ups based on projections that do not reflect the reduction in staffing or services. These are funds that may be repurposed in other departments, including $29.5 million and unutilized grants, nearly $18 million in the education formula and programmatic true ups in K through 12 and higher ed and $6.6 million in savings from new positions based on the actual start dates. There are number of items in this budget to be proud of and I'm thankful for the hard work of our subcommittee chairs and their members on fleshing out funding for these priorities. A few of the highlights are tax relief. Two of the governor's proposed tax relief measures are included in this document. First, the House includes $1 billion in one time homeowner tax relief grants. Our number is $100 million less than the governor's recommendation, but we're providing for the maximum exemption on assessed home value allowed by the Constitution, which is $18,000. Full average, Georgia's will receive property tax relief of nearly $500. Motor fuel, the budget reflects a $1.1 billion infusion of surplus state general funds repurposed as motor fuel funds to keep the Georgia Department of Transportation whole after a ten month suspension of motor fuel tax collections. We just to note, HR66 currently in ways and means ratifies that suspension. Economic development, $166.7 million is recognized for the large economic development projects receiving regional economic business assistance grants or rebagrants, including Hyundai and Rivian. $35.7 million to establish the rural workforce housing fund. This fund will be used for projects that lower the cost of housing, support the workforce, and promote development in our rural communities. $5 million to max the $65 million federal grant for the Georgia artificial intelligence manufacturing project, benefiting Southwest Georgia. It's a great opportunity for the state, and I've heard from many of you who are interested in supporting this project. $1 million to be matched by the Senate to complete the expansion of the Savannah Convention Center, the gun in FY23. The Convention Center is an economic engine of coastal Georgia, hosting more than 160 events and 200,000 visitors annually and supporting 28,000 tourism and hospitality jobs. We put $766,812 in for the Department of Agriculture to implement the Georgia Royal Dairy Act past last session. It's a $650,000 for the Savannah Logistics Innovation Center to support the logistics and supply chain industry in the Savannah area. We've invested in human capital. Throughout the budget, you'll see the House recognizes its needs to fund its obligations to Georgians, whether they're citizens receiving services, state employees providing them, or the retirees who've dedicated years of service to this state. The House includes $92 million for the state reinsurance program to lower healthcare premiums. Since this program's inception, there's been an increase in the number of providers available in the individual market. We've added $4 million for the Georgia Crime Victim Emergency Fund to offset a decline in probation fees collected. These funds are needed for victims and their families to help pay medical, funeral, and other expenses as a result of a violent crime. $2.6 million to support private psychiatric beds for adults and youth. And $1.9 million to restore beds at Georgia Regional Hospital. We've added $100,000 provided for technology infrastructure and environmental adaptations for students enrolled in inclusive post-secondary education programs, more commonly known as Ipsy. Now, we know that additional funds are needed to support our children in foster care. And the House provides $5 million to DHS for alternative housing options for youth with complex needs. The committee feels strong, very strong, about honoring our commitment to state employees. To that end, you'll see a number of items across several agencies where funds are added to ensure that the $5,000 cost of living adjustment provided in 23 and the 23 budget is funded equitably across state government. Providing for state retirees is a priority of this committee and many of you. This budget provides $14.5 million to provide an additional benefit adjustment in this current year for retirees. We consider this funding an opening bid in the beginning of a discussion to make this correction that we need to make. We hope the Senate will provide, help us provide a greater adjustment. Now education, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that the KBE program is fully funded in this budget at $12.4 billion. It's the state's largest single expenditure and arguably the most important. HB18 provides $128.2 million for the KBE mid-turn adjustment for a significant increase of $12,939 students statewide. We've added $3.3 million to DOE to equip the construction industry programs. These simulators support the construction career pathway. Students aren't credentials as heavy equipment operators, ready to enter the workforce. There's a waiting list of schools wanting to get these simulators and the House version provides for 32 additional simulators statewide. We've also added $1.25 million for school systems to implement a character to implement character education programs. Health. The House supports the governor's recommendation to recognize the increased expenses in the state health benefit plan and adjust the employer contribution accordingly. DOE budget is increased by $424.8 million to fund the cost of the increase for certified teachers. We've also heard from our local school systems about the impact of the increase to the employer contribution rate for the non-certified school employees that will cost them more than $16,600 per member per month and the hardship of implementing that hefty of an increase in one year. In lieu of that, the House version of the budget provides $100 million infusion to the state health benefit plan and reflects a three-year phase in of that increase. Effective January 1, 2024. This will ease the burden on our local school systems. During the COVID-19 public health emergency, Georgia Medicaid has continued health care covers for all Medicaid members once on the program. An HP-18 provides an additional $250.8 million to support the increased utilization and enrollment during the pandemic. Additionally, a plan has now been put in place by Congress to start redeterminations on April 1. The Department of Human Services and Coordination of the Department of Community Health will be responsible for evaluating the eligibility of all 2.6 million Medicaid members. An HP-18 includes $8.4 million for the staffing and technology needed for this Medicaid unwinding. Safety. The amended budget provided an opportunity to focus on one-time safety improvements across state agencies. The House adds $23 million to the Governor's recommendation for school security grants, bringing the total amount funded to $138.8 million to provide grants in the amount of $60,000 per school. The House recognizes that not all school buildings have the same needs and provides school systems with the flexibility to utilize the funds earned the best way they see fit among their school system. George and Military College will also receive $60,000 per school security grant to support domestic violence shelters, something we wish we didn't need. The House provides $2.4 million to upgrade security at all 48 shelters statewide, as well as an additional $2 million in one-time funds to offset the loss of federal funds that these shelters have experienced. The House adds $75,000 for the Georgia Peace Officer Standards and Training Council to upgrade security at their offices, as well. We've also added or confirmed $34.6 million to establish a new state-wide public safety radio network to achieve statewide communications for the departments of public safety and the departments of natural resources. We all know that communications important, but nothing is more paramount than being able to communicate during an emergency. This network upgrade is much needed and prevents state law enforcement officers from needing multiple radio and their cars to communicate with local law enforcement. Local construction and infrastructure. The House agrees to fund $51.4 million for emergency repairs, MRR, and life safety insecurity upgrades at our corrections facilities. Plus, an additional $5 million added by the House for technology, life safety, and security projects. We've added $73.1 million in the Quick Start program to support the design of a training facility in Newton County, construction of a training facility in Bryan County, and expansion of a training center in Poulor. All of these projects support the rapidly growing EV industry in Georgia and are part of the overall project commitment that I mentioned earlier. The House version provides $500,000 for the Department of Labor to fund repairs and renovation statewide. We know that the new commissioner has a need for additional funding. And we look forward to working with our colleagues in the Senate to address this agency's needs. In our Plains, Trains, and Automobiles Department, the House improves upon the Governor's budget by providing $25 million in motor fuel funds for increased costs for maintenance and materials in DOT. We've also provided an additional $7.8 million for airport aid. They're currently about $53 million worth of project requests. Finally, the House provides $3 million to continue our investment in upgrades to state-owned short-line railroads to class two standards. Within the DBHCD budget, the House supports the Governor's recommendation of an nearly $10 million renovation of the kitchen at Georgia Regional Hospital in Atlanta. We added another $4 million for a treatment mall renovation in Augusta. There's also $5.7 million provided for the Middle Georgia State University's aviation program to purchase aid aircraft and construct key hangers. Technology and equipment. We put $105 million to implement a state-of-the-art electronic medical record system to support medical education and training at medical college of Georgia. $3.5 million to the Professional Standards Commission to Overhaul its Educator certification and ethics system to provide better efficiency and improved security. $4.9 million is provided to the Secretary of State for one-time elections equipment replacement and upgrades. More than $3.3 million is provided to the Supreme Court and Court Appeals for a new docket system. The coding for the docket system used by both courts is very dated, and only one analyst at the vendor is versed and able to provide maintenance on the current system. $500,000 for the Department of Banking and Finance to purchase and implement software that automates the agency's licensing processes. This software will improve efficiency, alleviate employee overwork lows, and improve customer experience. In closing, I'd like to thank the subcommittee chairs and the members of this committee as well as the staff for the time and energy put into crafting this document. We worked at a rapid pace, but I believe we put together a document that takes advantage of the additional resources we have and uses them wisely on one-time expenses. Whether it's ensuring the safety of our children in school, guaranteeing that state agencies have the tools and the people they need to provide the services that Georgians expect or providing tax relief to our citizens, this budget and the $2 billion in knee revenue go a long way in meeting the needs of Georgians. I hope that you can join me in the support of H.B. 18. Mr. Chairman, I'll be glad to entertain questions. You have a few questions. Chair recognizes Chairman Perkel. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you for the presentation. Does the gentleman yield for a question, please? Yes, thank you. Is it not true while I absolutely loved the John Candy reference to Plains, Trains, and Onalbils regarding transportation to this great state is not true that this budget allows us to continue transportation projects in spite of a 10-month suspension of the gas tax. And further true, we continued upgrade state-owned rail lines in spite of that. As it further true, we have a commitment on the 105 public use airports around the state that transport people in cargo across this great state. Thank you, Chairman Perkel. Thank you so much for this budget. Thank you. I don't know if those are questions or I'm just a firm. And I hope the John Candy wasn't some kind of reference to me. You brought it out, sir. Recognize the reference. Is that not true? Thank you. Chair recognizes Leader Beverly. I hope this is a John Candy question. I can assure you it's not. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The question I have is about the $1 billion for a homeowner tax relief grant that you allocate in this budget $1 million tax relief. Is it not true that while you offer $1 billion for homeowner tax relief, is it not true that simultaneously you're asking local districts to absorb huge new expenses in the rising cost of healthcare for SHVP and pay increases? So as you push the number down the cost curve, local communities now, if you're going to take away property tax, you're going to give back a billion. The rising cost for SHVP and payroll, where is that in a budget? Where is it reflected in local communities now have to pick that cost up? If you're going to take away the property tax, digest, local communities. Well, the billion dollars in that that you're referring to does not take away from the local tax base. The state is funding that discount to local citizens that are homeowners. So there is no effect to the local cities or counties on the tax base because that's where that billion dollars is going to the counties and cities. Thank you. Chair recognizes with or should. Thank you, Larry. Isn't it true that the tax that we're giving back for the property tax is a rebate? So there's no offset in the local income tax. We're giving them money out of the coffers of the state. So to the point that was made, isn't it true that this is just money we're, the state is offsetting. There's no reduction in the local sales tax. That's what the billion dollars is is going to the local government entities that tax you on your home and then it will be forwarded home to the homeowners as a discount to them on their homeowners taxes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chair recognizes Representative Mary Frenzis Williams. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Is it not true that the Livsafe Program in Cobb is one of the 48 domestic violence shelters throughout Georgia that is facing serious budget problems due to the loss of federal funds? And is it further not true that they are also in need, badly in need of security upgrades? So I want to thank you for these badly needed ads that are going to benefit 48 domestic violence shelters throughout Georgia and I urge all my members, all the members, to join me in voting for this budget. Thank you, Representative Williams. And I know you know the needs of your local shelter and I think I share in your concerns because I have one in my community and I know that they've been suffering from, definitely from the cuts in the federal spending in them. Chair recognizes Chairman Darleen Taylor. Thank you. Just a quick parliamentary inquiry. We all know that Georgia, we have a very bad need for medical providers and that means we need more medical education. And is it not true that this bill provides funding to support new residency programs, housing, nursing programs for our rural communities and particularly Southwest Georgia, which is very needy? Thank you, Chair, Ms. Taylor. You're correct. I hope that we can continue to boost those residency programs throughout our state to help keep our locally grown physicians in Georgia. Thank you. Chair recognizes Representative Rhonda Burnow. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Is it not true that there is enough money to cover all the expenses related to unwinding Medicare, money for staff hiring a firm to get the word out, upgrading our technology so that we will not have the same issues we had with the unemployment distribution? Is it not true? Medicaid, I'm sorry. I'm not sure that I totally understand your statement but I'm sure the lady believes that was she speaks but I don't follow your question. I'm sorry. Well, what I was asking is to make it a little bit more clear is that we know the problems that we had with the technology doing unemployment and that our system was not prepared. And so now that we're going to go and have to go back, get these people reassign for Medicaid is our technology up to that so that they don't have a lot of mistakes. I think you're referring to the Department of Labor. The Department of Labor, the Commissioner has been in, I think, a total of two weeks. And he has sent to us as of two days ago his needs and hopefully that we will be able to work with the Senate to help make sure he is taken care of. And I would hope that we never have another pandemic that would cause the loss of employment that we had but hopefully with new technology and some of the requests that he has made that Department will be able to handle those needs more effectively. Can I further explain? Yeah. Okay. I understand that. I appreciate that with the new Commissioner. But what I'm asking for is that with the unwinding of Medicaid to make sure that there is enough money for staffing that those departments, that their technology is okay, upgraded so that there will be a handle, all that information that's going to be made in India. It is my understanding in the additions that we have made in both of those departments, the HS and DCH, this is the money that they have asked to be able to do just what you're talking about. Okay. Thank you. Chair recognizes Chairman Matt Dubneck. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Well, the gentleman yield. Yes. Mr. Chairman, would you agree that Georgia is the best state in the country to live, work, and raise a family? I do, and I'd like to add something to that and play. And Mr. Chairman, would you agree is it not true that for our families and our state to have a great place to live, work?

Those families and play that we need to further support our construction industry. Yes, sir. Mr. Chairman, is it not true that our vocational education programs in high school prepare our students for the workforce, which is a benefit to us all? And that those 32 heavy equipment simulators that we've put in the budget will teach our youngest learners in high school how to be job ready so that they can graduate and go directly into the workforce with a guaranteed job. Yes, thank you. Chairman, I do believe there is a long waiting list for those and I think that's just a sign of how successful that program is and how much we need them trained and ready to go to work. Chairman, do you yield for further questions? I'll maybe take two more. Chair recognizes Chairman Brian Perence. Oh, come on. Does Jeremy, is it not true that in this budget the $1 million that was allocated two cycles ago for the veteran seat money for the veteran cemetery in the Augusta area has been removed? It has been removed at this time, but it is in it stays as a line in waiting for that project to be granted and are awarded from the federal government. Does Jim a further year? Yes. Is it not true that this house, this Senate and our governor will continue to support the veterans of this state and when the proper time. Federal government gets their cycle open again. We will reapply for that position. I have all intentions to continue to support that with you. Chair recognizes Chairman Katie Dempsey. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Chairman, thank you so much for the work that you've done on this budget and the people that you've pulled together to actually do it. Like Representative Burnow, many people have come to me since I placed that measure on the desk about Medicaid and the unwinding. It is very true that in the budget we specifically spelled out the positions that will be very instrumental in that work. It was a little vague earlier, but this specifically does address those positions that I think will be able to handle it. Do you not agree in a different manner than the Department of Labor did? Also, one more thing, is it not true that we addressed the bed shortages that are across the state for those in serious psychiatric crisis, both children and adults? And this will help that in a great way. Yes, this house and this Senate and the governor definitely made a statement on supporting those with mental health issues last session and we have a duty to continue to do that. With that, Mr. Chairman, I'm going to yield the well and ask for your support of HB18. The gentleman has yielded the well. When he returns to a seat, the chair recognizes Chairman Hatchett for a motion. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Chairman, I move that House Bill 18 do pass by committee substitute. The chair recognizes Representative Marcus Weedow for a second. Second. Representative Weedow seconds the motion. This time we'll call the question on House Bill 18. All in favor will say aye. All opposed will say no. And it's time to vote. All in favor say aye. All opposed say no. The eyes have it and House Bill 18 passes by committee substitute. The chair recognizes the gentleman from the 155th chairman Hatchett. Mr. Chair, as chairman of the committee of the whole house, you're instructed to report the action of the committee of the whole house to the house. Chair recognizes majority of the administration. Mr. Speaker, the committee of the whole house has had under consideration House Bill 18 and has instructed me as its chairman to report the same back to the house with the recommendation that House Bill 18 do pass by committee substitute. The report of the chairman of the committee of the whole house is received. The committee of the whole house has had under consideration House Bill 18 and has reported the same back to the house with recommendation that House Bill 18 do pass by committee substitute. The committee of the whole house is hereby dissolved. The clerk will read the caption to House Bill 18. House Bill 18 by Representative Burns of the U.S. and the United Jones of the 47th administration of the 104th and Hatchett of the 155th, the bill be titled an act to amend an act, making it providing appropriations for the state fiscal year beginning July 1st, 2022, and ending June 30th, 2023, known as the General Appropriations Act. Is there any objection to the previous bill being ordered that Chair Here's None, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? Chair Here's None, the committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair Here's None, the report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Chair recognizes the gentleman from the 161st and what purpose does he rise? Part of entry inquiry. State your inquiry. Although it's small in the scope of our budget today, I think it's very important and that we appropriated $460,000 that hadn't been mentioned by the chairman nor has it been in our data sheet. We appropriated $460,000 to purchase 10 SUVs for the Georgia Public Safety Training Center which is a continuation of our program where we appropriated $1.1 million last year to provide 10 instructors at the Georgia Public Safety Training Center to teach, use the force, de-escalation and decision making. These SUVs will now be used to haul around some to tow vehicles, simulators that we got to a federal grant to go all over the state to teach all the local law enforcement agencies and state and those techniques. That was quite an inquiry there, Mr. Chairman. I'm sure it's correct that the gentleman says states that it is important work. Thank you for your inquiry. For what purpose does Representative Nullowicz from the 42nd rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Is it not true that we all in this room maintain excellent relationships to the best of our abilities with our municipal and county elected officials that are going to probably have a lot of questions from constituents that we share with them about the HUM UNR tax relief grants? I'm sure the lady knows what she speaks. So is it a further true that I know that every one of us in this room will likely help assist those local elected officials answer any questions they might get? I'm sure that's our duty. If the lady says states, I'm sure it's true. Thank you. For what purpose does the gentleman from the 116th rise represent the Holly? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that perhaps by looking at this vote board right now this probably serves as probably the best tribute to a former speaker that we can have in our recent memory? The gentleman so states and I can agree with him that he is absolutely correct and thank you to this House. Excuse me. I have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of the bill, the yeas are 170, the nays 1. The bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Now, River. The House will come to order. The House will come to order. For what purpose does chairman Hatchet rise? To make a motion. State your motion. I move to this House immediately transfer our HB18 to the Senate. Representative Hatchet moves at HB18 be immediately transmitted to the Senate. Is their objection? Here in none it is so ordered. If the chairman may take a moment, chairman Hatchet, to your entire team, congratulations on your work. It is an amazing document that addresses the needs of many issues for Georgians. We are very grateful to your work. You not only did your job, you went above and beyond and worked very long hours to get this document done in record time. Thank you to chairman Hatchet and your team. We will now move on to afternoon orders. We have quite a number of afternoon orders. I will ask the members that you will hold your afternoon orders to two minutes. We will start with chair manager for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I know we have spouses and loved ones who are participants in the Cosset program. As you all saw, you got your delicious mores made by Mercer Mercer or Cherns in Blue Ridge who have made these for us for several years now. They are on everybody's desk to enjoy the commemorate today as Cosset Day. For 35 years, Cosset has been in the state of Georgia and they have most recently moved into the last county that did not have a Cosset program. Cosses are an invaluable tool in ensuring children affected by abuse and neglect are able to meet their full potential. Over 200 Cosses are here today. Please take a moment to chat with them. They were over having breakfast and getting trained on how to interact with their legislators. They should be back over here chatting with you. Please watch for them. They are wearing a pop of red. Please listen to what they have to say. They speak with the force of authority whenever it comes to our children who suffer from abuse and neglect in the state. Thank you. Thank you, ma'am. Thank you, ma'am. Thank you. Representative Odin Sanya is recognized for an afternoon order. General, we'll suspend just for a moment. Representative, hold it just for a moment. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Dear colleagues, as we celebrate the second day of the Black History Month, I speak to recognize one of Georgia's great heroes. The late great John Lewis, an ordained minister, a representative of Georgia at the U.S. Congress. And a dedicated disciple of nonviolence, John Lewis dedicated his life to the cause of equality in our nation. John Lewis was 21 when he joined the Freedom Writers. And he was 23 when he helped lead the 1963 March on Washington. And John Lewis spoke immediately before Dr. Martin Luther King delivered the now I have a dream speech. John Lewis recognized that the fight for equality would last far beyond that speech or that moment in time. And speaking in 2006, he reminded us, and I quote, the dream of mon Luther King is not yet accomplished. And each of us must continue to drive hard to help build a beloved community in nation, a world at peace with its own self. During this Black History Month, I encourage each one of you to reflect on the work of John Lewis. And I hope that we can all walk in his footsteps and remember that there is work yet to be done to make this chamber. And this great state, a better place for us and for generations to come. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Chairman, Representative Karen Lepton is recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I rise today to honor the life and to mourn the sudden and untimely death of Patrick McCracken. Pat is son to Bob and Sandy. He is brother to Cassie. He is brother in Lawton Mike. He is uncle to Ellis. He is fiance to Tiffany with whom he was raising Addy. He was many things to many people in his hometown of Knoxville, Tennessee. We cannot properly express how much he is missed. We cannot measure the void. His absence leaves in the lives of those who knew him and those who loved him. Eternal rest, O Lord grant him eternal rest and may light. Petually shine upon his soul. Amen. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representative. Chair recognizes Chairman Jasper's for an afternoon order. Chairman Jasper's. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, if you look on your desk, you'll see a great opportunity and responsibility that you have. As a member of the House, you have the opportunity to name a road. Intersection, state highway, after someone important in your community. The criteria for this is not a lot. It is up to you. You need to take it seriously and take a look at this nice handout that Abbey Day, one of our policy analysts did. Pay attention to it. There are deadlines created within it. But the opportunity is fabulous. You can do a lot of good work at home by doing this. I remind members that they can use part of their house, allotment that you get each year to pay for your sign. That's up to you. If you have any questions, please come by my desk and ask me, you know, you'll get a letter. You'll get this in color this afternoon with a little bit of more information, some contacts of G-DOT, because you have to get a clearance letter first. This says that road is not already named. We do not allow renaming of roads in this committee. So take some time, take a look at it. Great responsibility. You'll be on the front page of the paper when you get to do this at home. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I would remind everyone there are rules in roads naming. So make sure you speak to the Chairman and you comply with it. Very important issues we need to attend to, but you have to go by the rules. So thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chair now recognizes Chair Tyler Paul Smith for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, this house I rise today to honor one of Harrison County's native signs, as well as this great state of Georgia, the nation, and one of our own houses, former members. Judge Harold Lloyd Murphy passed away peacefully in Rome, Georgia on the morning of December 28th of 2022. He was 95 years old. He led an extraordinary life, one dedicated to his family, ideals of public service, and served as an inspiration and role model to countless members of the legal profession. He epitomized all the fine-care traits of the greatest generation, hard work integrity, self-sacrifice, personal responsibility, modesty, loyalty, and strong devotion to God in country. His morning small community of Falton, Georgia shortly before the Great Depression, the son of a farmer and rural male carrier, and mother, who was a schoolteacher and principal. He then west Georgia College in following an intervening period in World War II with a stint in the United States Navy. He returned and finished his studies at the University of Mississippi and the Georgia School Law. The 1949 graduate of the Law School is classmates included Governor Carl Edwards Sanders and Thomas Bailey Murphy, former speaker of this house. He originally studied law with the goal of joining the FBI but came back home to Harrison County to practice law. There he practiced law and also served in this house elected first in 1950 and retiring in 1961 to focus on his practice. In 1971 he was appointed by Governor Jimmy Carter to the Spirier Court for the Talipus a judicial circuit. And after his presidential win, President Carter nominated him to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. Until age 90 he continued active status on the bench. Upon retiring and taking senior status, he still continued to work in our Northern District here in Georgia and was truly a friend to Everlaria that ever asked him any advice. I appreciate his testimony, his example and hope that all young attorneys and all of us as Georgia will follow that for many years. Come if you join me in a quick moment of silence.

Okay, I see a lot of people's not here and that's good because they won't know this. Once a bill passes out of committee, you still have one more step. It still has to have the rules committee forms filled out. And until that happens, your bill or legislation will not even be considered to make it to the House floor. So if you pass legislation, be sure that you come up to the rules committee, fill out the form or you can hate to say it this way but you can kiss your legislation goodbye. I can personally attest that that is the gospel. So according to Richard, excuse me, according to Chairman Smith. So you best heed the gospel. We don't have any birthdays today but we do have a birthday on Saturday. February the fourth, Representative Amani Barnes. Representative Barnes. Happy early, early happy birthday.
