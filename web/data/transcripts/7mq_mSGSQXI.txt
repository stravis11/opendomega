TRANSCRIPT
----------
Hi ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate everybody's patience while I was trying to hobble up here.
This is the subcommittee of rules on lawsuit reform.
I'm Rob Belverin and I'm chairing the subcommittee and we are here today to hear Senate Bill 69.
So sort of the plan is to, I've got some folks who have signed up who want to speak in favor.
And of course, the Senate's sponsor of Pro Tem is here.
I was going to let him present the bill.
We also have a substitute, which I've handed out
to the members of the subcommittee.
And I can, after the Pro Tem presents,
I will kind of go through there and just try to highlight
with the specific changes in the substitute
are from the bill as it passed the Senate.
And then we'll hear some testimony
and then we'll discuss the bill and try and take action.
So, Senator Kim, if you want to go ahead and present to us, please sir.
Sir?
Yes, sir.
All right.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Good afternoon, members of the committee.
I appreciate the opportunity to present to you Senate Bill 69, which comes to you with
significant support from the Senate.
In fact, I think it was unanimous, I remember correctly, coming off the Senate floor.
So it's a good bill for your consideration.
You know, last week we passed an historic tort reform that addressed a variety of topics
that address some unfairness in our legal system.
and today I bring you the second portion of Governor Kemp's
tort reform legislation, which is focused only on one issue
that has been increasingly problematic, or not only Georgia,
but for our nation, and that is third party litigation funding,
TPLF. For those of you that are aware, third party funding
litigation refers to a contingency arrangement between a
non-party financier and a party or a potential party
to a lawsuit in exchange for a property interest in the judgment of a case that has an expectation
of a return. It is because it is within a contingency arrangement, it means that the financier may
not realize a return or even a recruitment of the funds that are provided. TPLF largely applies
only in funding arrangements with a plaintiff as you would expect. It's important to note that TPLF
is not a small industry and it is growing annually. In 2023, analysts reported that the US
commercial litigation finance industry managed an estimated 15.2 billion dollars in assets
with over 2.7 billion committed just in 2023.
However, despite the massive scope of the industry in Georgia TPLF is subject only to the contractual terms between the private parties.
And there are no consumer protections in the arrangement in place for the plaintiffs entering into those arrangements.
Cases brought by Georgia citizens who alleged being wronged by TPLF funders have resulted
only in the courts recognizing that the current laws applying usury limits or lender regulations
simply don't apply in TPLF arrangements because these are not a loan.
This results in a gap for what is essentially the same conduct as regulated lender entities,
but the returns on the TPLF investments are contingent on the outcome of the claim and
And that's the critical element that distinguishes these arrangements from what we all know and think of as a loan and thus doesn't fall under any of the current regulatory structure that we have.
Third party funding litigation is basically unregulated gambling on our judicial system.
There are no protections in place for the plaintiffs that enter into these types of arrangements.
cases in Georgia where consumers complain about their treatment show that there are no
protections and there are no standards for these arrangements and the courts are looking
to the legislature to give some guidance.
We have clear evidence of foreign involvement which is yet another concern of why this
needs to be addressed.
Foreign involvement in our nation's judicial system and it's getting to the point that
the U.S. Department of Justice is highlighting that foreign entities are funding litigation
to influence American domestic and foreign policy.
Our Department of Justice is advising American lawyers and law firms to register as foreign
agents when litigation is funded by these foreign entities.
We have an obligation to give litigants and our judges the tools and guidance they need
to uphold the integrity of our judicial system.
I know that we can often get bogged down in lawyer bills as we call them around these
hulls, but this is really a consumer protection measure, and it also combats the growing foreign
influence in the judiciary.
That's a chairman if I could, I'll just briefly kind of run through by grouped sections.
Section 7-10-1, which starts on line 28, and by the way for the record, I'm looking at
L.C. 49, 2, 1, 6, 0, E.C.
Is that the appropriate Mr. Chairman?
Yes, sir?
Yes, sir.
This is line 29, which is the beginning portion
Section 2, Elineated is Section 2.
Okay, I'll try to stay away from,
I'll just go by headings and stay away from line numbers
because I'm not gonna get that specific
unless you want me to.
Basically, the first four or five pages
really deal with definitions that begin on page 2
and go all the way to page 5
until we get to Section 7-10-2.
That section requires litigation financiers that they must be registered and you'll see
in that provision or that portion rather that talks about what's required for the registration
process and how that is to occur.
The next section, which is 7-10-3, says that litigation financier may not do certain things
so it gives the prohibitions against what someone that's in this business may do or not do.
I'll highlight one thing, Mr. Chairman, which is in its under 7-10-3A subparagraph 4,
which is line 192, and if you're following along in LC 2160.
That's in 239 on the sub.
Okay.
There's an important provision here that in essence it says that the contract for receive or recover whether directly or indirectly any amount greater than an amount equal to the share of proceeds collectively recovered by the plaintiff.
This is in the those items that are provisions and in essence says that the litigation funder is not going to get and should not get more than the actual plaintiffs get net net after the arrangement.
arrangement. The next section is 7-10-4 that says in essence that a litigation
funder is jointly liable for sanctions. That's a short provision. It's only about
a half a page. That's 10-5 in the sub. The banking
finance added a section to the sub that would provide for denials of applications
to be registered and then what the process is to appeal that so the section you're talking of is 10-5 and sub.
Okay. And the next section 10, excuse me, 7-10-5 on mine, but I guess it would be 6 on yours.
Just basically says, you know, the terms of an agreement of this nature should be in writing.
And specifically goes forth and sets out what those terms or at least some of those terms must be.
that's about two and a half pages and that gets us on over to 7-10-6 in my
version I guess would be 7 in the sub and this addresses circumstances where
certain provisions would not apply to some arrangements where there may be
funding being provided but specifically fall outside of the definitions that are set forth here.
And then pretty much finally Mr. Chairman the last section talks about the penalties at 7-10-8 or
with these 7-10-9 I guess in this that sets forth the penalty provisions in the event that if this
If this becomes law, what would happen if there is a violation of what we are saying in this bill would be the rules of the road for litigation financiers as they deal with plaintiffs in that arena.
That's a high level Mr. Chairman, but that is in essence what the bill addresses.
Again, fundamentally it is number one, a consumer protection measure or
payments because right now those that enter into agreements with third party litigation
funders in the event that there is a dispute and unfortunately there are cases in which
there have been substantial disputes and some pretty egregious,
egregious behavior on behalf of third party litigation financiers that have
take an advantage of plaintiffs and those people find themselves in a situation without
much remedy and virtually no regulation or oversight by the government because it doesn't
fall under banking and it also doesn't fall under the securities laws that we have.
So with that, Mr. Chairman, I understand, as you alluded to, that there is a sub.
I saw it literally just a few minutes before this hearing, I'm not complaining about that,
the cause of that if I would rely upon you.
I think you kindly agreed to perhaps
point out for the committee the changes
from what we pass to what is the sub for consideration today.
Absolutely, Senator Bigline.
And just for the committee's benefit, subcommittee's benefit.
So the substitute basically preserves
that first section, 7-10-1, that goes into page five
of the sub, then 7-10-2 does have a few changes in it.
That starts at line 111 on page 5, and I think runs, I think on page 8 maybe, yeah runs
to page 8, on page 6 there is a change there in line 132.
The percentage that sort of determines, you know, sort of a disclosure requirement with
respect to the ownership of the entity that's applying to be a litigation
financier or the person. The threshold was 5% and the original bill, it's now
been changed to 10%. I believe the Department of Banking and Finance said that
is a more customary percentage with respect to triggering at the
disclosure of the beneficial owner requirement and so that's been changed to
10% there on line 132. On lines 158 through 163 of the sub, that is the prohibition against
foreign adversaries participating in litigation financing. They've changed that language there
to try to make it clear that all the phrases that were in that section, foreign person,
and Principal Sovereign World Fund apply not to any foreign person, but just one that's
affiliated or from one of the foreign adversaries.
So we're trying to clarify this doesn't absolutely prohibit foreign involvement, it just prohibits
involvement by foreign adversaries as they've been determined by that federal regulation
that's referenced there.
Then 7-10-3, which starts on page 8, that's a brand new section, Department of Banking
asked to put that in. If you look through that, you'll see it basically provides when they
can deny a registration to someone who's applying to be a litigation financier. And, you
know, if they don't meet requirements in the chapter, there's a prohibition there against
someone who's got a felony conviction in the last 10 years who's involved in the financier,
and then they define what constitutes a conviction. Then going on to page 9, they address the
process if you are denied, there's a notice that goes out to the applicant and they have
a right to appeal it and then the proceedings from their honor handled basically under the
administrative procedure act. So that entire section there is brand new. Then 7-10-4 was
the old 7-10-3 on the bill as it came from the Senate. Their 1 or 2 changes there on
lines, 232 and 233 of the substitute, there's a prohibition there in line 2 about paying
commissions, referral fees, rebates, and that sort of thing.
And this just makes it clear that they can do that with their own employees.
They're just not supposed to give any sort of kick back in order to get work.
And there's also the same exception was placed for Mines 234 to 238, that's about accepting
commissions or for all fees and so forth, they excluded employee agents or affiliates
of the litigation financier.
The rest of that section I think was the same, I believe, on 7-10-5, I'm on page 12 now,
That was 7-10-4, and the Senate bill came from the Senate, and this provides for joint
several liability for the litigation financier, for any order or imposing or assessing cost
or sanctions against the suit, a consumer, arising from the proceeding for which the
financier has provided the financier.
This just sets a threshold of 25,000 or more in funding, and then provides that they would
be jointly a severably liable, and toward the end of that paragraph in 278 to 211 says
that where the financiers write a prepayment is a fixed amount set by contract, then their
liability for the joint sever liability they have would not exceed whatever their right
of repayment is, less whatever has already been extended.
Then I think we go through a couple of pages on the form of the litigation financing
agreement, the required disclosures and provisions that are not changed, the exemptions are not
changed. I think the next change is on page 17, line 409, that section is new and that was
requested by the banking department so they can basically use their current sort of registration
system and software to do this registration on as well. So that goes that whole
section 7-10-10 is new and then section 3 is unchanged, section 4 the effective
date did change. They're basically saying here or we're changing it so that the
whole registration requirement and all of those prohibitions that are
associated with it, don't become effective into January 1 of 2026.
That's because obviously it's going to take the banking part a little while to get all
this set up, be prepared, get the word out there, and get that platform running.
Section 3, which is the section that just provides litigation financing agreements are now
discoverable, this is amendment to the Civil Practice Act, that becomes effective upon
approval by the governor or becoming law that is approval and applies to
Proceedings commenced on and after the effective date of the act or contracts entered into honor after the effective date
So the discoverability would would have a would apply sooner, but the rest of it won't take effect until January one of 26
Senator Kennedy, do you care to comment on any of those changes or?
No, Mr. Chairman, I think I followed most of them.
There are a number of them, but they're largely housekeeping and they're ones that the banking
department requested just to sort of give them the required regulatory structure.
And then there are a few substance ones like adding the $25,000 threshold and allowing payment
to employees of a litigation financier, as opposed to kickbacks and that kind of thing.
So any questions for the senator?
I think I had Chairman Newton.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you for your work on this.
If you could help me at last section 3 for lines 445 in our sub, but there are sections
about litigation financing and the fact that it's discoverable but it can't be used as evidence
but it is admissible. Could you help a non attorney understand those two A and B sections of
that? I know some some that will apply to things that are 25,000 or more. It looks like and then
I'm just trying to understand how could you try to explain it to a non attorney?
Sir, do you have the sub with you up there?
Yes, sir.
OK.
And to be sure, Mr. Lyme, 445, I'm talking about on the sub.
Mr. Chairman, to be sure, I'm looking at 492382 ECS.
Is that right?
OK.
So Chairman Newton, I'll let me look at that and try to.
And some of this is new for me.
But the beginning of line 445, in essence,
This is the, we talked, and I talked in my comments about the value of disclosure and
transparency, that in essence, I think this is the essence of that, that a party may
obtain discovery of the existence of a litigation financing agreement as it's defined within this
code section, which would be relevant to or subject to a particular pending action.
is added after the however is new language and I would only assume that that is the purpose
of that is to have it be non-applicable to arrangements at a threshold of $25,000 or less.
And then the B portion of that which is lines 450 to 453 says information concerning the
litigation financing agreement is not by reason of disclosure, admissible and evidence
trial and again that makes sense just because the standard for that which is
discoverable by the parties through the discovery process is very broad and
intended to be very broad and then when you get to a hearing or a trial setting
that is one of the gatekeeping functions of the judge just to narrow that down to
that which the judge determines is relevant and admissible meaning that it's
appropriate for the jury to hear it or receive it as a piece of evidence and I
think this just reaffirms that that notion that's baked into the normal evidentiary process.
Is that that explains it? Okay, yes sir. I understand now that there's one section that's
purposely very broad in discovery. There's much more limitations on what's admissible to
you. Exactly, yes sir. And I should mention too, I missed the last two lines on that page,
to $25,000 per vision that I guess you can obtain it from another party, but you can't
go get it from the non-party unless it's $25,000 or less, you'd have to be $25,000 or more
for you to be able to use discovery, third party discovery to obtain it from the fancier.
That is, I believe, new in this substitute also.
All right, let's see, Representative Evans, I believe you next.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Protein, I really appreciate what you and the governor are trying to do here as far
as consumer protection. Very, very much agree with the goal.
Thank you.
My question is about, it starts on line 366 of the sub, but I think it would be line 303
of perhaps the version you're more familiar with, even though I don't think that section
changed. But it's the part where we're saying what provisions this chapter does not apply
to, and it's got a section about a non-profit entity, and then the third sort of exception
is a regulated lender.
And when I first saw this, I thought, well, what about Aunt Sally?
That lends money to her niece or nephew because they're going through hard time and needs
help to pay for whatever they need to pay for attorneys or whatever.
So my first question was going to be, are we, do we really mean to haul Aunt Sally's family
loan into this situation?
I don't think we do, this is a long, this is a long-winded question, but I want to try
to work through it with you, because I think we have the same goal.
When I flip over to the definitions of litigation, financier, and particularly litigation financing
agreement, that's telling us what's in here, and because the only things that are in here
have to be alone that's contingent on the outcome.
And none of the things that are we're trying to exclude
in section starting online 366 are those things.
So I'm worried about us being contradictory.
I'm worried about us, I'm probably not saying this very
clear, I'm trying to work through to my head.
We don't normally say this is what this bill applies to.
And then let me tell you these things that it doesn't apply to
that are already excluded because they don't meet the
definition.
So I'm just wondering, do we really need lines 366 to line 388?
because everything in those lines are not things,
are not loans that are contingent on the outcome.
And we've already said this is about things
that are contingent on the outcome.
So can we just make it easy and make sure
that we don't haul Aunt Sally and the court
is really my question.
Thank you for the question.
And I appreciate it.
And I appreciate your effort to work through this
to make sure we get to the right landing spot for this,
because as you said, and I appreciate your comments
that you agree with the policy that we're trying to meet here.
I think because this is new, because this
unique because we're talking about an animal out there that is a a type of
vehicle that is not recognized or regulated and because we are getting into this
area for the first time I do think it's prudent to talk about what this is not
and I think that's why we do need section 7-10-7 identifying what this
doesn't apply to. For example, you're coming about the Aunt Sally loan. That shouldn't apply at
all because it's a loan. And third party funding litigation is not a loan. A loan has the concept
that there is a repayment required. Third party funding litigation doesn't have a repayment
of the underlying indebtedness. It is an obligation to turn over funds pursuant to
to other contingent occurrences such as, or specifically, the litigation maturing into
a verdict that produces a recovery.
And so that's one of the ways, again, that I think we distinguish this and want to make
this, makes this a little bit odd.
We're trying to, trying to address that.
So I do think there's value representative and utility in talking about what this is
not I think if we're going to address this and we've tried to say this is what
this business is let's avoid unnecessary litigation and squabbling and
fighting over who's in the pool and who's out of the pool by where we can think
of those circumstances identify these are specifically out and I think it just
adds clarity to what we're trying to do
Okay, along those lines then in the sub online, 384, where we are trying to exclude a regulated
lender that does not receive, would you be opposed to striking the word regulated so
that also an unregulated lender, the aunt Sally example, that this exclusion also applies
to her because otherwise if we've a court's going to say well you told me what it was
and you told me what it wasn't and you told me that a regulated lender it wasn't but you
didn't tell me that an unregulated lender it wasn't and so I'm worried that the court
will believe us and I don't think you mean to including it Sally.
So if you struck regulated, then you are broadening the definition of what is not included.
Is that the objective?
Is that?
Yes.
And if Aunt Sally has a litigation funding contract that's contingent on the outcome,
she's going to be included because of the definitions.
So we're not bringing any, but we're not excluding anybody.
I think you mean to exclude and we are excluding people that I think you mean to exclude if
If we were to strike the word regulated, I think you gave me the line for the original
bill.
Yeah, it's on the original bill.
It would be line 321.
Yeah, I believe that section was not changed.
We're that particular paragraph.
My concern is, and I know so many eyes have been on this far more than mine, obviously
principally the governor's office, and I don't, in your aunt Sally example, I don't think
that's, I think that's clearly outside because it's alone, so it's not included.
My concern is, I'm not sure of the import of how much this would broaden it to just
right regulated from the document and so for that reason I would not want to do
that without understanding or appreciating the potential ramifications of that
in the moment. Well and perhaps there's a way to make another exclusion but
well let me just make sure I am clear we don't and you're not intending to wrap
Aunt Sally's loan to her niece or nephew into something like this into this
bill. No because as I said at the beginning you're what you're describing is a
learned and that doesn't fall under the definition of a third party funding
financier anyway. So she's I think by common sense by the definitions of the
bill and by the other explanatory language she's not included already so I
don't think there's a legitimate concern with her being wrapped into this.
Well let me try to figure out then to I want to maybe I agree with you. Why do we
have three lines 384 to 388? Why do we exclude a regulated lender that does not
receive in consideration for loaning money to any person or right to receive
a payment and so on and so forth. That's alone, too, right? Why do we exclude
them and their loan from a regulated lender but we're not going to exclude a
loan from Aunt Sally. I'm just concerned how the court's going to read this
because if you're going to, if you say we don't need to exclude Aunt Sally
because that's a loan and these are not about loans, to me, the
exclusion we're trying to make in 384 is also a loan so the court's going to say
we excluded that one but you didn't exclude hers. Well, I think it's a
beginning point if we try to identify everything will go and exclude this bill
will be a thousand pages because we could come up with every possible
permutation of things that are excluded I think the drafters the original
drafters of the bill and those that have looked at it from the banking
department to other folks to the our executive branch thought for any
circumstance in which there might be some argument that let's go in and
clarified but again back to your Aunt Sally example that's clearly not
included. I would agree if we didn't have this exclusion section but I appreciate
you talking through it with me. Sure. That just my whole concern is that we've
said what it is and then we've tried to say what it's not and I think we could
have we could create problems for ourselves. That's my concern but I appreciate
your answer. My last question Mr. Chairman is about section three. I think it's
the last section where we are making things discoverable and I just want to
understand what why are we making these agreements discoverable. I don't
think as I don't think a plaintiff would be able to discover how a
defendant is paying their bills and so I'm wondering why does the defendant get
to get to discover how a plaintiff is paying hers. Sure. First of all it's
about fundamental transparency, as you know, as a practitioner, one of the questions we
ask all the time in Vordire is anyone that has an interest in the lawsuit, or the outcome
of the lawsuit, clearly a third party funding financier does. It may be even something that
the court will ask, as you know, in federal courts, sometimes they will actually ask the
questions of identify anyone that has an interest in the lawsuit. It would be extremely unfair
and calamitous if we wound up with an owner of a third party funding litigation company
that sat as a juror on a case and nobody knew that his payday depended upon the verdict that he
might help render. I agree with you I agree with you so it is the parties that we're trying to get
to not necessarily terms. No I think it's everything. Why are the terms relevant? Why are they not?
If you're going to identify not only the parties, I think the terms of the document ought to be.
I really would say the question is, why does there seem to be some fear in this?
And I don't mean to express any fear. I'm just trying to make sure we're being fair,
because I know that you wouldn't get to discover how a defendant is paying their bills.
I agree with you, we get to know who the insurance company is, because we get to exclude those people from the jury,
and I agree with you 100%.
If somebody's got an interest in the outcome,
just like we do for our dire on plaintiff's lawyers,
if they have a contingency fee agreement,
but we don't do it if they are getting paid by the hour.
If their money depends on the outcome of the trial,
the jury does need to know the people,
because we need to make sure they're not one and the same
or they're not related.
I agree with you, but I'm having a hard time
understanding why my concern is harassment.
My concern is hauling all these people in here
and asking people for discovery on how they're paying their bills
and how they done this with that.
That's my fear. My fear is not, I don't have any problem with the fairness you're trying to create, and I agree with you on that, but I'm trying to understand why the terms are relevant.
Yeah, the terms are relevant. I think two things. One, I don't see this getting into some sort of harassment territory.
You're going to get the document that shows the terms what could be or would be harassing about that. Nothing. I don't think.
Number one, number two, and I think, representative, I think it's driven by addressing the fundamental
problem we've got of the corrosive nature of this type of business with these undiscovered
documents and unidentified parties in our justice system.
And what we have now are large hedge funds from foreign adversaries that are involving
themselves in our civil litigation funding, excuse me, our civil litigation system that
can then create an imbalance because they are gambling on the results.
I mean, traditionally our system is the parties go in, they are the ones that have something
at stake.
The plaintiff has been wrong and wants to be compensated and should be if there's liability
and damages.
The defendant takes their position.
You're now injecting someone else into the system that nobody knows who they are.
knows what the terms of their document are. Nobody knows how motivated they are. And it's
injected into our system and it's not good. And again, I would turn the question. I
would think the real question is why try to keep this secret and why be secretive about
it. There's simply no reason to. If in fact, this is all fair and above board.
Listen, we are in agreement on if I'm really really not trying to disagree with you. I'm
trying to understand why.
Because a plaintiff is not gonna get to know,
hey Mr. Defendant, how did you afford to have that,
whatever, that briefcase, how would you afford to be here
and not be working all day?
How do you afford to have, you know,
30 of your senior executives sitting in the front row
of trial instead of working back home?
How do you afford that?
No one asked those questions,
and I don't know why we're gonna ask them to the plaintiffs.
And I appreciate and I understand why we need to know
about the parties, but I haven't heard the terms,
and maybe we disagree, but I haven't even heard of a reason.
Yeah, and I think the short answer is in the traditional case,
the jury's not asked a render decision
to financially reward the defendants.
It's the plaintiff's, not the other way around.
OK.
Well, I've gathered my best.
I'm trying to have a question.
And I thought the Chair might mention something,
was the ladies concern about the exceptions,
more the fact that enlisting exceptions
that might arguably be beyond the scope
of the definition could imply broader applicability
of the definition.
I wonder if rather than striking regulated,
although that might be a solution,
if we could add language just to make it clear
that the listing of specific exceptions
is not meant to broaden the applicability
definitions beyond their terms. That's just, that's just something I throw out and we'll
think about. Maybe so, Mr. Chairman, I guess I'm, and I appreciate the intellectual energy
that the representative is putting into this to make sure we think about things so we don't
wind up litigating or it produces a lot of unnecessary litigation because some ambiguity.
I just, I fundamentally, I see the utility in, here's what this is, this is what it does.
And here's a few things to be clear that it does not touch.
My assumption is the simple reason is there were some things that certain actors will concern
might be covered and this is just to give them comfort that it's not intended to cover.
Yes, sir.
But it does, I think the ladies concern is a reasonable one, although I don't know if we necessarily
get there.
Also one if there's maybe a way short of deleting the word regulated if that's a concern that we might still be able to address a concern
I was just
Positing that possibility
All right, I believe
Whip Park was the next
Person who's light was flashing
Thank you, Mr. Chairman
Mr. Pro Tem want to bring your attention to lines 389 to 392 on the substitute
lines 326 to 329 and the original version of the bill as it passed the Senate.
My question is, certainly with the substitute, we had a $25,000 materiality provision
with the original version of the bill, there's also due process for those who are registering as litigation financiers.
With respect to, again, lines 39 to 392, it says any violation, however minor,
would result in the underlying litigation financing
agreement to be void and unenforceable.
Should there be a materiality threshold
or an opportunity to cure?
Because if those provisions are not otherwise in there,
where this would be an automatic penalty,
does that not raise due process concerns?
Mr. Representative, maybe my version is different.
You said any violation of this chapter, however minor,
the words, however minor, is not in the version
I'm looking at that you just added so maybe I don't have a current version so the words
however minor is not in there so you added that when you just read that okay but the bill
does read as however minor because there is no reality no it does not read however excuse
me however minor that's not in that language is not in here so so any the word any right
any violation of this chapter, right?
Okay.
Again, are there any process concerns related
to not having an opportunity to cure the agreement
or would you be open to again some sort of threshold?
You know, I think given the penalty structure
that's baked into the bill that I think is fair
and balanced, if we're going to have
good consumer protection measure in this bill that's driving this, and I think it needs
to have enough teeth so that third-party litigation funders don't take advantage of plaintiffs
that are in a position of needing the funds at the time. They're already in a situation
that they may be injured, they may be out of work. They're not in the best, typically
the best phase of their life that maybe that they have otherwise enjoyed. And I do think
to give it to give it teeth to this and make sure that there's a penalty mechanism that
makes sense that will truly get their attention and not be overly cumbersome on everybody
involved.
I think this simple straightforward answer is or approach ought to be that if you violate
this then you're not going to be able to stand on this document and reap all the benefits
that you thought you were.
I understand the importance of having teeth.
I think it's more a constitutional due process concern
that may exist with the bill without having an opportunity
to cure an existing contract.
I don't think what you're describing representative
is a constitutional issue.
Nothing about what you have described as your concerns.
And you may just be thinking or seeing something here
that I'm not seeing.
But nothing about this rises to the level
of a constitutional concern in my mind.
I've not heard anyone else express that along the way
that this path that this bill has taken.
And I would also say to see the language
as begins in line 390.
Any violation of this chapter is pretty common language
we see in the code for other provisions.
And I'm not aware of any constitutionality,
talent, or concerns with that general verbiage.
So, a follow-up if I may then, you know, Section 3 allows these sorts of contracts, including
terms, to otherwise be discoverable in ongoing litigation, certainly if this is enacted this
year.
During that discovery phase, if they find an aspect of the financing, the litigation financing
agreement that does not meet the requirements of this legislation, without automatically
make that litigation financing agreement board and enforceable, because certainly I've
I've seen other aspects of state bills that have this any violation, but not so much that it's automatically void and enforceable.
That's the part I'm struggling with.
Okay, if I understood your question correctly, you're talking about arrangements with their contracts or whatever they may be that don't fall under the provisions of this bill.
So if they don't fall under this bill, then this provision that you're speaking of lines
392-392 would not attach and apply to those type documents, contracts, or materials.
I don't think that's getting out my question, but I'm sorry, maybe I'm just, could you
restate the question?
I'm happy to try to answer it.
I just must have misunderstood.
So again, my understanding of the application of this is that if there's any sort of
violation. In my own words, however minor, the litigation financing agreement automatically
would become void and unenforceable. If we are then allowing these sorts of contracts
to be discoverable per section 3, does that provide the defendant's attorney an opportunity
to make null and void the underlying litigation financing agreement that a plaintive may have
entered into?
I would not think a third party can render a contract between two other people void, but they could make that an issue in all his gays.
That's what I'm struggling with. I don't see how the defendant has standing to even make that argument or assert the position that a contract to which they are not a party is impaired or ought to be, ought to be voided.
then who would then then how would this this then otherwise be enforced it's
enforced because if in fact the plaintiff who's the consumer who's the
contracting party with the third-party litigation funder if this contract
violates public policy violates George Law they have the right to say what
am I this contract is void they are the contracting party the plaintiff is
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I believe that chair Lee Miller.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Mr. Senator Pro Tem.
Speaker Pro Tem, Senator President of the Senate.
Go President.
Vice President.
I do just, and thank you for the bill.
I do appreciate any effort to protect consumers
and have traditionally been concerned
with sort of the disparity between consumers working people and banks and lending institutions, et cetera.
So I do thank you for the thought that went into this.
And this is more a question of curiosity than criticism and all really,
but for a person who is not as familiar as lending industry,
guard rails, rules, regulations. Would you say that the the limits that are being
imposed on third-party lenders here are similar to any other place in our code
where we impose restrictions on lenders? I'm sorry any other place in our code
you know say traditional banks or anything like that is this sort of
modelled on something that we already see? I don't know that I would say it's
It's necessarily modeled on something we see in the code, because as I said earlier, it's
not a one.
So this type, this device, if you will, doesn't check those boxes so that you within
expect to see some other model that dealt with this.
It's not a security.
That was the other thought we had.
Well, maybe this should be in the securities code.
Should it, is this kind of a security, well, it's not that either.
I would tell you that there are some third-party funding litigation bills that are getting passed
around the country.
I think there's one from Montana that has passed last year or year before last, but that's
not really what you're asking.
You're about, I think you're asking me, is this found elsewhere in the code?
I don't know, quite frankly, the governor's office who did the human's work on drafting
this might have an answer for that, but I think the real answer is probably not because
we're dealing with an animal that, and quite frankly, we as legislators are here to address
this because it is totally unregulated, totally unaddressed and law, and that's where we're
seeing arguably why we're seeing maybe some abuses out there and why we need to consumer
protection measure.
Sure, and I support that.
I will, though, say that, you know, in my experience, you know, sometimes planets just simply cannot afford to finance litigation, to finance medical expenses when they're in pain, and unfortunately can't get traditional loans.
I am not opposed to regulating this industry, obviously.
I am just wanting to make sure that we are making it fair to consumers and not keeping
consumers from something that might be valuable to them.
One of the things I was curious about was the section that was added in the sub-dealing
with directors, officers, et cetera, of the entity who have taken a first offender plea.
And I was curious about whether that, what's the rationale for that?
So why would we say that they cannot, if so facto, because they took a first offender
plea within the last 10 years, not be able to engage in this kind of business, assuming
they cross every other T dot every other I behave exactly the way that you
want them to behave under this bill. Why would where are we cutting out that
class of folks from engaging in this business? Can you point me to where that is?
And is that fair? That's that's new. I'm not sure that was necessarily
Senator Kennedy's innovation. I think I can answer that question. I believe
that came from the banking department and that is I think fairly common in the
banking regulatory space like for directors and officers of a bank. If they have any kind
of family conviction, even if it was a first of interplay, that generally can be a disqualification
from serving as a director or getting a bank charge. So I think they were just modeling
on existing regulatory or statutes that set up some regulatory framework that they're
familiar with so they can administer. That's what I was trying to figure out. Thank you, Mr.
That's a good question. Thank you. Thank you.
Chairman Newton, thank you.
Just a quick question, thank you.
You kind of answered it. I was going back to the regulated lender in the fact that we did get information
disinformed somewhat by the banking department as well since this is a type of loan.
I'm just curious to regulated lenders. I'm sure have certain written document requirements.
I'm assuming unregulated lenders would not have the same level of documentation.
And therefore, I guess maybe the banking input was in this, regulators, the only one
where you required to have written documents, it could be, would you, that certainly
makes sense.
I'm assuming that.
Unregulated lender, we don't have a lot of control over, I guess.
All right.
Thank you, sir.
Mr. Nevins.
Just to follow up on Chairman Newton's point, if that's true, then perhaps one way that
We can make sure that we don't disrupt Aunt Sally and have her called in for a deposition
on her unwritten loan agreement is that we limit Section 3 to written discovery.
Is, I'm sorry?
Is that we limit Section 3 the discovery part to written discovery?
I just take Chairman Newton's point.
Yeah.
I wouldn't agree with that because we're back to the point.
I think we all agree.
I don't think anybody says Aunt Sally's learn is subject to this, and it's not.
I agree, which is why I don't know why you don't want to say it.
That's my confusion.
I agree.
The definition of these agreements, and an agreement doesn't have to be in writing.
The definition of agreement doesn't include Aunt Sally.
But when you go to another section of the bill and you start saying who it's not,
and you won't allow us to put in the word, or you don't agree, we could still try,
futile, but you don't bless a change to make sure that we don't
also exclude Aunt Sally, I don't understand that because if these people that got excluded
got excluded because they were afraid they were going to be included, I don't know why
we're so scared about making sure that we exclude Aunt Sally. That's my point.
And I get that. I think the difference in my mind from these type folks that are referenced
in here in the specifically excluded category, unlike the Aunt Sally circumstance, because
it's a loan it's out already and so the how is line 384 not alone because well it says
I regulated lender but it may be a lender that's engaging in third-party finance
litigation in which it's not a loan and if it's not a loan perhaps you're into
the great area where this might be subject to it it says a regulated lender that
does not receive in consideration for loaning money to any person it's trying
it's excluding a particular type of loan from a regulated lender. I'm just
trying to make sure we also exclude loans from an unregulated lender and I
don't understand the hostility to it. Well the other concern if we're gonna if
we're gonna exclude Aunt Sally then are we going to open up the possibility of
individuals that want to get into this business in a way that skirts the
regulations they may not be a family but it's an individual that wants to
skirt the regulations and again I think the clarity is here and it may just
conceptual but as a beginning point Aunt Sally is making alone and they're
excluded. Just like the just like the regulated lender that we're excluding in
line 384 is making alone. And again we can have a thousand page bill if you
want and think of every possible scenario. I definitely don't want a thousand
I just would like an intellectual honesty and considering him and that's that's all
Well, I think
We have an impassal in that issue, but I think the ladies made a point. I think the the senator has responded with this perspective as well
That's in my mind that's something we're still thinking about so
Good Miller
Thank you, mr. Chairman one other thing just as I'm trying to process
process, what I really like about this bill, and I just want to make sure we don't have
any unintended consequences. The section in the sub that allows for the litigation
financier to be jointly and severally liable for any award or sanctions for frivolous litigation
that might be imposed against the, I guess, the plaintiff's lawyer or the plaintiff's.
So that's lines 272 to 281 of the sub.
Yes, Mr. Chairman.
With the point made in the bill that the litigation
financeer is not permitted to participate in the litigation,
not permitted to attempt to influence resolution of the case,
and really has no function, which I think the bar rules
probably would prohibit this anyway.
But what would be the rationale for making a litigation
financier who's doing a good job, who's following all the rules,
who's being fair, and some attorney does something in court
that the litigation financier had no say in,
and they get hit with a sanction that the litigation
the financial is now on the hook for that.
I mean, shouldn't, I guess I'm just trying to,
is that designed just to keep people
out of the business of doing this,
which I'm not sure what is what we're trying to do?
We just want to regulate it.
What is the fairness of that,
assuming that the litigation financial is otherwise
abiding by the regulations that are addressed in this bill?
Sure, I think number one, you've set up a hypothetical
it's probably not going to be realistic or no way to determine did the third party litigation
financier were they totally excluded did they never involve themselves did they not participate
in the decisions did they not bring pressure and so I don't know how you get to the bottom of that
other than making it clear that they are subject to being jointly in several in global number one
Number two, I think some of the concept may be
the desire for the exception, but if you're not engaging
in litigation financing, you're not subject to the act anyway.
No, the problem is the way it's defined it would.
That's the challenge.
But it seems like a total, you're seeing an entity
that doesn't engage in litigation financing, ultimately.
And I go to, I'd have to go to definition of litigation finance.
A litigation financier means that any person engaged in a form created or established with
the purpose of engaging any kind of business.
Have you ever seen in agreement itself what you want produced that allows the third
party financier to make decisions about litigation?
In litigation, not that I've been involved with, but in litigation that has gone on in other
states between consumers and funders that has existed. Yes. What states would
those be? I could get you copies of those cases. That's not a problem. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you. Chairman, is Chairman in? Just a quick follow up on that.
Yes, sorry. I mentioned about the discovery of an insurance policy for a professional of some sort.
I do know that we all face this. There's a consent to settle clause that you may or
or may not have in your policy, which is discoverable
and shared with the plaintiff.
And there are times, if the insurance company
can settle without the consent of the provider,
that's in that documentation.
And the plaintiff's not gonna learn that, correct?
And then by the same token, if you looked at that policy,
if you were representing the plaintiff
and it said it did not have that consent
to settle agreement for the insurer,
then you'd know that the only person
had to go to was the provider themselves. Is that right? So that's the kind of thing
you'd like to find out in the reverse when it comes to the prosecution. Exactly, yes.
Okay, thank you. Yes. All right, thank you. Thank you for your testimony today.
Is it Rachelle Mortimer?
Good afternoon.
Thank you, is this, can you hear me okay?
Okay.
Thank you, Chairman Leverett.
Thank you to the members of the subcommittee for giving me the opportunity to present
before you today.
I'm here to support SB 69 and I won't take up too much of the committee's time.
I just wanted to highlight a few of the provisions that we think will be really helpful in this
bill.
So first, just to take a step back on some of the history of TPLF, I represent the U.S.
of commerce, our Institute for Legal Reform, and we have been looking at this issue for
over a decade, studying the transition that the litigation financing has gone through.
So the industry actually started over in Australia and slowly migrated into other countries.
But an interesting fact about litigation financing that some researchers have found is that
a lot of the litigation financing market right now is actually located in the United States.
So some estimates are that about 50% of the market is in the United States now.
So the reason that the Institute for Legal Reform has concerns about this type of funding
is as people have mentioned before me, so I won't go too deep into it, or some of these
control aspects, conflicts of interest, concerns about how this litigation financing can affect
to the course of litigation, what suits are brought,
how long they take, settlement, et cetera.
So I think some of the provisions in SB 69
that will be really helpful, especially
on the consumer protection side,
are that elimination of control over any of the litigation
because there are instances that we've seen
of litigation finances trying to insert themselves
into litigation to take control.
And I think one important part of that is that this bill
actually make sure that the claimant themselves is aware of the litigation financing and is
aware of their right to control their litigation and that the funder has no ability to take
that sort of control away.
Another concern that ILR has that I wanted to point out that this bill addresses is some
of the foreign investment in litigation financing so this is a concern that we raised several
years ago, and we have through investigations in the last several years come to see several
examples of this being a problem in the United States. There has been investigations
or concerns expressed by the U.S. Department of Justice as to certain types of this sort
of foreign investment and litigation financing. Two foreign or sorry litigation financiers
that we know of have investments from sovereign wealth funds that are undisclosed, and we have
seen cases where a Chinese funder is funding litigation in the United States, particularly
in the patent space, and that was not just closed except for an investigation that was
undertaken, that revealed that funding, but at the moment we have no way to know if there
are other sorts of these types of funding in the litigation.
concern that was expressed by DOJ was that these types of litigation, this foreign litigation
funding could be used to, you know, compete essentially with the United States businesses.
So litigation obviously takes up a lot of resources and time for a business.
So if you're a competing business in a foreign country, if you invest in litigation against
that competing business, it might make it harder for them to invest in research and development,
and hiring employees, things like that that would give you a competitive advantage.
So, again, I really appreciate the committee's work on this and I would just say that we
would like to support SB 69 and I'll stand ready for any questions.
All right, thank you.
I don't see that you have any questions.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Phil Goldberg.
Good afternoon, sir.
podium Mike's on when you're ready.
Great.
Thank you chairman members of the committee for having me today.
My name is Phil Goldberg.
I'm a partner of the law firm of the show Cardi and Bacon in our Washington DC office.
And I spoke this summer with the National Conference of State legislators about
mitigation financing, and because of the impact it's having on our civil justice system.
And I was asked to testify today by Jordan's for lawsuit reform, which as many people here
know, focus is on ensuring a fair balance and efficient legal climate for all Georgia
citizens.
The basic premise, and I think we heard the speaker before me talk about this, is that this
This is new. This is completely new. This did not exist 15, 20 years ago in the United States.
When I went to law school, I didn't know when I took all the torch classes and all of that.
They never talked about litigation financing being the driver of a lot of mass-tort litigation.
But that's what's been happening over the past few years.
It's as a professor at Einstein, it's one of the leading academics on this,
has said it changes every aspect of civil litigation,
which cases are brought, how long they're pursued,
when they are settled, all without transparency.
They're operating in the shadows.
And so this legislation will change that in common sense ways
that are focused on protecting the courts.
And importantly, the parties, both the plaintiffs
and the defendants.
There's a little bit of a misnomer here
about the litigation financing.
It's litigation investing.
These are hedge funds, institutional investors
and others who have figured out how
to take advantage of the access to justice that our courts rightfully give people to bring
lawsuits and try to see recompense from being harmed. Today, as we heard, it's a $15
billion industry in the United States estimates are that I'll get the $31 billion by 2028.
In the mass dorspace, you regularly see $50 million loans to law firms. Some have been reported
to be $200 to $300 million. But there's no legal structure for all this new investment,
and for all of this new impact on litigation,
there's no structure, there's no regulations
that protect the integrity of the litigation process
from including things like basic disclosures.
So this legislation, I hope people appreciate,
is not about stopping TPLF.
It's about protecting the courts and the parties
from the TPLF abuses.
And it's maintaining access to justice
for both the plaintiffs and the defendants.
At sometimes, as the speaker reformer alluded to,
the plaintiffs doesn't even know their case
subject to one of these agreements. The defendants don't know who they're settling with, who they're
litigating with. The courts are supposed to be about allowing these defendants and these
plaintiffs to come together, they've got to dispute, they're trying to go to the courts to get
a peaceful resolution of it, and they need to be able to do that without that someone saying
looking at this solely as an investment mechanism. In the mass tort space, which is about two-thirds
of where the litigation funding is going, what they do is they do portfolio funding. They
underwrite entire litigations.
It's been called the Vendorization of Mass Tours.
When I was on a panel last year on this,
the funder actually was saying that Chido
was a good thing that they're basically in partnership
with their law firms, that that was one of her selling points.
So this is very different than I think some of the things
that we've been hearing today and some of the concerns.
These are different sets of concerns.
One of the things they do is they increase,
they drive a lot of the TV advertising you see.
It's $6.8 billion in advertising from 2017 to 2021.
Report came out a couple of weeks ago.
Then in 2024, there are $2.5 billion in lawsuit advertising,
up 32% from 2020.
And I'm sure you all hear, see it every day as we do.
Their goal is to make litigation too big to fail,
to try to get 25,000 plaintiffs, 50,000 plaintiffs to sign up.
That's a completely new thing that's never happened.
But this mass of losses doesn't mean
there's truth to any of the claims.
Because what I'm trying to do is
they're trying to litigate the mass, not litigate the merits.
And so you have the Federal Rules Advisory Committee saying
that there's widespread agreement among lawyers and judges
that up to a third or a half of all of these claims
don't have merit.
That the plaintiff can't show they use the product
that they are suing over.
That they can't show they have disease
if they're claim that they have.
And because there's no vetting of these claims,
because no lawyers can go through all of these,
and they often don't even know the plaintiffs,
don't even know who their lawyers are.
And so the judges are frustrated,
because they'll say to the lawyers,
work up these 20 cases for a bellweather,
and we'll see what happens.
And regularly a third to a half,
just get dismissed voluntarily, just dismissed out of hand,
because there's nothing there.
At the end of the day, you can't settle,
you can't try 25,000 cases.
So you end up where litigation admittedly has had no merit.
There's one case from a few years ago over a medication
where it resulted in a $775 million settlement,
even though all the bell-weather cases ended up in defense wins.
But it was too big to fail, and the court said,
we got to get rid of these cases.
So these are funding elucrative lawsuits.
They're not funding good lawsuits.
And so I know my time is short,
and I just want to make a couple of final points.
Without the basic disclosures, we are seeing,
and there are stories that we've seen,
Cisco was one where the funder,
that Cisco came to an agreement with the plaintiffs,
with the defendants, the funder that gave the law firm
and Cisco money, came in and said, nope, not good enough.
We want this litigation to be a baseline
for future litigations.
We're not accepting that settlement,
and they actually had to come in
and try to step in in Cisco's place.
So if we litigate the case,
It's just like, we're out.
We want to be out of this, we want to sell these cases.
And the opinions from that case
talk about how the lawyers were really doing the funders
bidding, not their clients bidding.
When you're in the mass tort space, where the funder
is driving the litigation, and the plaintiffs don't even
know who they are, who the lawyers are,
who do you think the lawyers will be paying attention to,
and who's interested they're going to be focusing on.
And so we see the conflicts of interest
like that, the ulterior motives, and then some of the privileged issues that were alluded
to earlier in terms of the private information of the plantas medical records and the confidential
information of the defendants are being turned over to the funders, because the funders
want to see this in part of estimating the cost and the investment.
So this legislation helps solve a lot of those problems, brings TPLF out of the shadows,
The reputable companies that are heard earlier value the idea of being part of a regulated industry.
Requires disclosure upon requests of the parties, prohibits funders from the controlling the litigation,
makes so the funder can't get more to the judgment than the plaintiff, and then bars the sovereign wealth funds.
Yes, so yeah, so I just my finally just this allows people to sue when they are injured by someone's malfeasance, but it protects the system from this outside of you, so thank you very much.
Thank you for your testimony, appreciate it.
I don't see any questions, so I'm going to go ahead and close the receipt of testimony.
Ladies and gentlemen, I know I am known for these marathon sessions without a break, but I'm going to take a break now
Thanks, you can thank Chairman Newton because he was kind enough to give me this water earlier
So I'll let's talk about a 10 to 15 minute break and then we'll reconvene to discuss the bill
