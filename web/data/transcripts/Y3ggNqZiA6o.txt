morning it's um a rainy day in Georgia I
think
outside but where else would you want to
be other than in Georgia big game
tomorrow night as we turn the tide back
towards some
space so it's a good day let's um let's
begin our day as our custom by a very
special chaplain of the day a
friend to all of us in this house and
someone I've enjoyed over the years
hearing his message as he's presented it
to this
body we'll begin our day with scripture
reading and Prayer by the chaplain and
after which we will pledge allegiance to
the flag of our country now our chaplain
this morning has numerous folks in his
congregation that serve in this house
but this morning he will uh be
introduced by one of his uh members and
let's see I think who is that that's
going to be Mr representative Clint Crow
come on Clint come introduce
Benny thank you Mr
Speaker good morning colleagues it is my
pleasure and honor to once again welcome
Dr Benny at uh back to this house um as
many of you know and have have heard him
here before he's been here several times
but it's always a pleasure um I enjoy
hearing him enough that it's it's a
pleasure for me to get up early on a
Sunday morning to drive 30 minutes to
the church to go listen to him every
Sunday so um I know it'll be a blessing
to you as it will be to me uh Dr Benny
Tate's been the pastor of Rock Springs
Church in Milner Georgia for 34 years
and in that time has seen tremendous
growth in the church and the ministry in
that church uh one of which is Rock
Springs Christian Academy which is
especially uh important to me as my
children and my two youngest children
and my two grandchildren go to school
there and I'm honored to get to serve on
the board of the school along with uh
Pastor Benny and two other guests that
we have here with us today the executive
pastor of the church Cameron shifflet
and the pastor of the branch campus Trey
Varner and they both serve on the board
with me at the school there as well so
uh wonderful people wonderful Church
Pastor benie is a wonderful man a
God-fearing man and uh his mission is to
serve people and Reach people for Jesus
and that's exactly what he focuses on um
there's also a book on your desk there
several of us in here that that got
together and you'll find a copy of his
newest book on your desk it's a gift to
you it's unlimited uh I think you'll be
blessed by it and I hope you'll read it
and uh following the lead of my my
friend chairman Prince yesterday brevity
is a virtue none of you want to hear me
you all need to hear him so with that I
will welcome my pastor and my friend
Benny
Tate thank you thank for being here
thank you good
morning it's an honor to be here as uh
you know I've spoken here for uh 34
years and I I just thought about
something
today uh when the speaker said lock
those
doors I thought I'd love to be able to
do that at church
amen just lock those doors uh you know
uh no no no I but it is a it is a real
privilege and I appreciate Clint Crow
and as he was introducing me I thought
about something that happened to a
basketball coach by the name of John
Wooden some of you probably remember
that name he was being introduced one
time and the guy just kept on and on and
and uh he got up and Coach wooden said
this he said uh first of all I want to
ask God to forgive my introducer for
praising me so much and then John Wooden
said I want to ask God to forgive me for
enjoying it so much so Clint thank you
for that introduction you were very very
kind um I'd like to I'd like to share
some verses with you today from uh The
Book of Matthew Matthew Chapter 2 and
and I will be
I will be brief I promise um Matthew
chapter 2 verse 10 says this it says
when they saw the star they rejoiced
with exceeding great joy and when they
were coming to the house they saw the
young child with Mary his mother and
fell down and worshiped him and when
they had opened their Treasures they
presented him Gifts of gold and
frankincense and myrr and I want to take
just a few moments and uh I want us to
to learn from these wise men I I think
there's some things that we can learn
from these wise men I read yesterday
that the number one gift to buy for
Christmas is gift cards and I heard
about an elderly lady who did just that
she bought a bunch of gift cards and she
got her Christmas cards and in every
Christmas card she she wrote these words
buy your own gift this year buy your own
gift this year she mailed all of her
cards out but she didn't get any
response and about two weeks after
Christmas she opened a drawer and she
found all those gift
cards so everybody got a Christmas card
that said byy your own gift uh uh this
year here's what I want to talk to you
the wise men were
wise and I think they teach us a lot
about giving gifts I really do I think
they teach us some things that we can
learn about Christmas and giving gifts
the first thing I think we can learn
from the wise men is this this year
let's give an unexpected gift let's give
an unexpected gift we can all agree that
Mary and Joseph were a poor family as a
sacrifice for Jesus they weren't able to
offer up a lamb they offered up total
dos and when these men arrived from
Persia bringing Gifts of gold and
frankincense and myrr I don't think
nobody was expecting that kind of gift
it was certainly a unexpected gift my
mother's birthday is on October the 20th
and for years I would send my mother $20
and then later it became $50 on her
birthday on October the 20th but my
birthday is on November the 9th and what
my mother probably did for 20 years is
she would take the $20 bill she would
get it on October the 20th in Middle
Tennessee and then she would mail it
back down here on November the
9th now I don't think either one of us
had done any giving it was just a gift
for a gift gift gift and we give a lot
of gift for gift gift gifts but I pray
this year that we would give somebody an
unexpected gift I love what John Wooden
said he said you can't live a perfect
day without doing for someone who will
never be able to repay you I want to
encourage this year let's give somebody
an unexpected gift because we really
haven't given until we give an
unexpected gift the second thing I
learned from the wise men is why don't
we give a gift that will
last why don't we give a gift that will
last that a gift that will last beyond
us few years ago Pastor Cameron and I
went to
Oklahoma and we had lunch with a guy by
the name of David Green you may not know
that name but David green and his wife
when I sat down with him I said to him I
said my wife helped make you a
billionaire he started Hobby Lobby
and during that lunch David Green said
to me he said pastor we get so caught up
on things but there's only two things
that are going to last
forever I appreciate the capital but by
the way it's not going to last
forever I appreciate the Democrats I
appreciate the Republicans but by the
way that's that's not going to last
forever there's only two things that's
going to last
forever that's Souls of people and the
word of
God I just want to challenge us this
year not only give an unexpected gift
but give a gift that will last the third
thing I see
quickly is giving changes
us giving changes
us these wise men came and the Bible
says after they gave the gift they left
a different way see get ERS never have
enough but givers always have
enough and I want to be like Bill bright
I want to do my giving while my hands
are still
warm Somebody almost clapped that's a
first I I want to do my giving while my
hands are still warm because ladies and
gentlemen when God blesses us he has
more than us in
mind what do the wise men teach us they
teach us to give an unexpected gift they
teach us to give a gift that will last
we're still talking about it 2,000 years
later they teach us that giving changes
us but then there's the last thing that
they teach us they teach us that Christ
is truly the greatest gift Tri Christ is
truly the greatest gift I I hope you
enjoy your
book somebody met me in the hall and
uh I said to them I said uh have you
read my last book they said I sure hope
so I shouldn't be hard on my book it's
the type of book once you lay it down
it's hard to pick it back up it's really
a unique
book I hope you enjoy the book I would
ask you to pray for me I I I I close
with this story I've I'm uh having to
stay pretty close to my notes because
I've had torn retinas in both
eyes and uh these torn retinas in both
eyes reminded me of a story I I heard
about a young girl that was
blind and she was blind and she was
bitter maybe I would be bitter too if I
was
blind but she was just bitter about life
and she had a boy boyfriend and he loved
her deeply and she said if I could if I
could see the world I'd marry you but
she was just bitter because she was
blind and apparently somebody donated
their
eyes and through transplants and through
advancement she was able to get those
eyes and she was able to
see and once she got those eyes what she
didn't know she saw her boyfriend
who wanted to marry her deeply and he
was blind
too and when she saw
him maybe he was kind of like me or
Clint she didn't want to
marry she said no I'm I'm not interested
in marrying
you and she walked away and she she left
him he sent her a letter lately later
and said I sure do love you and I hope
life goes well for you and uh P.S I hope
you enjoy my
eyes it was
neat it was
sacrificial that he gave his eyes but I
want to just remind you on this
Christmas somebody gave more than their
eyes they gave their
life they gave their life life for you
so this year as you put your presence
under the tree I just want to remind you
that God placed his present on a tree
and that greatest gift was the Lord
Jesus Christ let us
pray Lord I Thank you for this day and I
thank you for speaker Burns I thank
thank you for the privilege of all these
years getting to come here these people
mean something to me Lord I love every
one of them it matters not to me whether
they be Democrat whether they be
Republican whether they be independent I
pray your blessings upon their family
God it's a sacrifice for these men and
women to serve and they'll be right back
in January serving again so I ask you to
be with them I ask you to be with their
family those that are struggling during
this holiday season meet the needs of
their families sons and daughters that
maybe are going through a difficult time
and above everything I pray your
blessing upon this body would you bless
them and keep them make your face to
shine upon them be gracious unto them
lift your countenance upon them may they
experience your peace for I pray this in
Jesus name amen amen

resolution 3 EX on behalf of Governor
KMP to ratify the governor's temporary
suspension of the collection of motor
Fuel and diesel fuel taxes in response
to his three executive orders declaring
a state of emergency for inflation as
hardworking Georgians and their families
continue to weather 40-year high
inflation and continue to face uncertain
economic headwinds the governor's action
delivered direct and real relief to
Georgians at the pump and to their fam's
budget it has saved Georgians roughly
150 to $170 million per month since it
has been done like the resolution that I
brought brought forth on behalf of the
governor last session house resolution
66 which received unanimous approval
from both Chambers this resolution
simply ratifies the governor's
suspension of motor Fuel and diesel fuel
taxes over the last three months on
average that is around 30 cents a gallon
for diesel or motor fuel this is a
necessary procedure and again the
governor's executive actions which were
issued in consultation with the general
assembly's leadership along with the
governor and general assembly's
Collective efforts to conservatively
manage our state's budget has allowed us
the opportunity to help lessen the
burden of historically high gas prices
and support Georgia's response to the
economic realities of today um with that

opposed so U that's what we all how the
process will flow so at this time we
will recognize the chairman chairman
Leverett to present the
Bill thank you Mr Speaker ladies and
gentlemen of the house good morning I
present to you for your consideration
house Bill 1X which of pass will adopt a
new set of districts for the Georgia
house and we've put that up on the
screens there for y'all to see the
proposed map that would be enacted by
that uh by that bill um first a little
history to set this in context on
October 26 2023 judge Steven Jones judge
of the United States district court for
the Northern District of Georgia entered
an opinion and memorandum of decision in
which he ruled that the house district
Maps we approved in 2021 violate section
two of the Voting Rights act as a result
he ordered that new maps must be drawn
and instead of drawing them himself
which he could have done without
allowing us any input he kindly allowed
us to remedy the violation by drawing
new maps
ourselves judge Jones also thoughtfully
gave us specific guidance and how we can
comply with his order to clarify the
manner in which we can remedy the
violation ourselves judge Jones wrote
that and I am quoting from the opinion
on page
509 the remedy involves two additional
majority black house districts in South
Metro Atlanta one additional majority
black house district in West Metro
Atlanta and two additional majority
black house districts in and around
making bib so as we as a state hope to
better Alabama in a certain sporting
contest this weekend we will not follow
the example of their legislature in the
lack of seriousness and respect we
Accord a thorough and detailed decision
of a federal judge whom I think all of
us respect and admire very much and I
know I do we will comply the bill you
have before you will adopt a map that
does just that it fully complies with
judge Jones's order as judge Jones
instructed this map enacts five new
majority black districts in South Metro
it creates house District 74 and 117
let's move to the second um map in the
packet
if you'll zoom in a little more for me
that's good so 70 uh if you'll move to
the South a little thank you so 74 is
sort of the light green one and 117 is
the brown one and about this hole right
there and about the center of the
screen and met in West Metro it creates
house district 64 if you'll move down
just a little bit other way I'm sorry
you can see 64 is over there in Douglas
County and it's sort of in the the taupe
color as
well and then in mon bib I'm I'm asking
you to shuffle around one more time down
towards mon area it creates house
District 145 and house district 149 all
of these have majority Black age
population voting age populations judge
Jones ordered five new majority black
districts and this plan creates and
establishes five new majority black
districts and it decreases the number of
majority white districts by five as you
know we cannot have
185 house districts we are limited to
180 so to make up for that we make that
adjustment it does not purport to tell
judge Jones that we know better than he
does and that we've done something
different but better that he should
accept his equivalent without explaining
how it's equivalent this plan doesn't do
that instead it follows his
order this is the only plan presented to
the redistricting committee that
complies with judge Jones's order now as
you might expect creating five new
districts was very disruptive to our
existing districts there are significant
Ripple effects especially when you
create five districts at one time Ripple
effects result primarily from
constitutional and legal requirements
that the districts be the same size as
far as the population is concerned now
we are allowed some statistical
deviation and in Georgia we have
traditionally limited ourselves to plus
or minus
1% so once we took areas from existing
districts to create the new five
districts we had to add population to
those existing districts from which we
drew the new ones so that their
population would get back up to within
the
deviation which by the way as you know
the ideal size is
5951 so that's what we were shooting for
so as a result we had to borrow or not
borrow we had to redraw the districts so
that we took areas and population from
uh adjoining districts from the
neighbors and then the neighboring
districts were short so we had to take
from their neighbors and that process
continued until the ripples effectively
run out or you Circle back around and
and result in parity
as we went we followed our existing
traditional redistricting principles to
work on the remaining districts these
principles include maintaining District
populations to deviations less than plus
or minus one limiting additional split
counties we only added a single County
split in this plan drawing the new
districts by utilizing the most recent
precincts from County government which
makes it easier on our local election
officials going forward ensuring all the
districts were contiguous that they all
were reasoning compact in shape and
ensuring that communities of Interest
are protected as far as
possible and we did try to the extent we
could to avoid unnecessary pairing of
incumbents now much has been made of the
fact that this plan does admittedly pair
it does include several incumbent
pairings which is not surprising when we
had to reconfigure these districts after
adding five new ones and the pairings do
pain me
greatly I wish that I could add five new
districts without any pairings or
drastic changes but I could not find a
way to do it and contrary to assertions
that we're being overly partisan we did
not inflict political casualties solely
on the opposing party we inflicted
damage on both we tried to take some of
of that uh fire
ourselves as we went through the process
however our primary overriding objective
was to comply with the Court's
order five additional majority black
districts in specified areas now much
has been made of process here and giving
some rulings I reluctantly had to make
today I suspect much will be made of it
today we have been accused at times of
moving too fast and not being
transparent and I concede that we have
have been moving quickly but I'm
reminded of one of my quotes when a
Louisiana politician once promised
during a campaign that he would be as
honest as the times will
allow we're under a court imposed
deadline we did not receive the Court's
order until October 26 and we
immediately began drawing and released a
plan on November 28th two days before
any alternate plans and we've been as
open as we could be under the
circumstances we're under a deadline
here we got until next week to get this
plan and two other plans
approved we held two hearings we allowed
numerous parties to
speak we established and maintain a
portal for public comment and we allowed
an alternate plan to be voted on
yesterday even though the bill enacting
it no bill enacting it had been filed or
even assigned to the committee now this
morning we attempted to allow another
opportunity for votes on Alternate plans
but when we got in the committee room it
became apparent to me that the documents
that were being presented in order to
achieve certain intended objectives did
not match the intentions of the sponsor
and that was completely I'm sure
unintended was not
intentional because these things happen
when you're trying to get stuff done
fast and our rules are intended to make
sure that we don't make mistakes when
we're in a hurry and I did not feel that
I knew what we were voting on I didn't
think the documents match what the
desires were and so for that reason I
Ruled reluctantly ruled those motions
out of
order now so in the time constraints
we've had we've been as transparent as
deliberate as the times will allow to
quote the gentleman from Louisiana now I
don't mean to complain about the Court's
imposing a deadline I understand the
need need for it and under the
circumstances it's reasonable but that
does limit our ability to take more
time um that that deadline is there for
Honor for us to honor and respect not to
disregard and we got to meet it and as I
said it's seven days away and we still
have two other plans to consider so we
had to move with all deliberate haste
the stakes are high here and we need to
act the court will not give us another
chance to draw these plans if we don't
get it right the court will appoint
someone to draw plans or Draw the plans
itself I take seriously my obligation to
the court and to each of
you members of both
parties to prepare and present maps that
comply with the Court's order I think
it's in our all of our best interest to
do that where I could accommodate
requests from you without jeopardizing
potential Court approval of the plan
because that is the primary goal Court
approval I've tried to accommodate you
when you've asked where I did not feel
that route was possible given the
overarching primary objective of
complying with judge Jones
order I decline the request and I'm
truly sorry I could not accommodate
every
request I hope all of you know I care
and respect each and every one of you
even when we disagree and we do that a
lot like most
families but our primary task here today
is to comply with the court order this
plan complies with judge Jones's order
it fulfills Our obligation
and I ask that you vote in favor of it
Mr Speaker I'll you have for
questions gentleman yield I yield you go
for a question Mr chairman I thank you
I'll just say before we take question
I'll thank you for your work I know you
put you put in a lot of hours um and um
we do appreciate that as members of this
body thank you speaker we have a couple
of questions that have popped up let's
see
we have one from the gentleman from the
43rd representative Arden
s has a question gentleman recognized
does the gentleman yield I yield yes sir
um given what we learned yesterday at
the Committee hearing isn't it true that
this Republican map still violates
section of the voting right act well I
don't believe it does and more
importantly I don't believe it violates
the judge's order unlike when we're
drawing maps from scratch we're are not
acting in a vacuum of trying to
interpret the Voting Rights Act we have
the benefit of a an expert who also has
the force of law behind him judge Jones
and he has told us what to do and these
plans comply with that order in my
opinion do you yeld one more time I
certainly will all right um so Brian
Sals um opened it up um to you yesterday
that this map if we move forward with it
does in fact violate the voting right
act and you are my acknowledged that
yesterday I acknowledge his opinion yes
sir I don't agree with
it
okay thank you repres represent
representative
Rees is recognized for a question to
your right thank you Mr Speaker with the
chairman youer two questions about
traditional redistricting principles yes
sir uh Mr chairman is it not true that
the bill before us uh reduces the number
of County splits by one County from the
2021 redistricting yes that's my
understanding yes sir and is it also
true that your bill made every effort to
reduce the number of incumbent pairings
in compliance with uh in the course of
complying with judge Jones lengthy order
we did yes sir and it was we did thank
you Mr chairman thank
you gentleman yel for one more I will
yes sir let's
see the lady from the 47th the uh protim
of this this house representative Jan
Jones protim is recognized for a
question thank you m thank you Mr
Speaker does the gentleman yield yes
ma'am uh Mr chairman just so I
understand you spoke with both
Republicans and Democrats as you were
working on this plan right that is
correct does gentleman further yield I
do yes ma'am thank you and you drew this
plan in the reapportionment office with
utilizing Miss Gina R is that correct
yes ma'am I did and you were able to
incorporate suggestions of both
Republicans and Democrats into this plan
is that true I was to some extent do and
and finally I'm assuming that you and
perhaps you can clarify you had requests
from both Republicans and Democrats that
you were unable to put into the final
plan much to your regret yes ma'am
that's correct thank
you Mr chairman we have a couple of
hours here we can continue to discuss
this plan so um I appreciate you taking
the
questions uh at this point do you have
any further comments before we hear from
some other folks on this bill I do not
Mr Speaker and we'll yield the well I
ask your favorable consideration of
House Bill 1ex thank
you the gentleman jul well thank you for
your
remarks now we have a one hour for those
opposed allocated for those opposed to H
be 1X and one hour of for those in favor
so at this time I will recognize whip
park for whatever portion of that hour
he would like to take whip Park is
recognized thank you Mr
Speaker colleagues I rise in opposition
to House Bill 1 EX for two
reasons first this Republican map
is
unlawful it is a map that judge Jones
can and should
reject
second this map is an
undemocratic
unamerican blatant exercise of partisan
gerrymandering that harms the freedom of
Georgians to elect their candidate of
choice I appreciate the majority party's
effort to comply with judge Jones's
order however under existing law the
proposed Republican map does not comply
with judge Jones order to draw five
additional majority minority districts
instead the Republican map actually
draws only a net of three additional
majority minority districts let me
explain the Republican map creates five
new majority black districts but it
takes takes away two majority minority
districts and fast growing to cab and
Gwynette counties judge Jones ordered
this body to take five steps forward and
two steps back one of those steps back
is house District 81 which is a majority
minority District in Northern decab
County under existing law in the 11th
Circuit Court of Appeals this district
is clearly protected by the Voting
Rights Act
it's a district in which Black and
Hispanic voters work together and have
the opportunity to elect candidates of
their choice but the Republican map
takes away that choice and moves the
district to the South Metro area to
protect a white
incumbent the second step back is house
district 105 in gwet County this is a
majority minority District where black
Hispanic and Asian voters work together
and have the opportunity to elect C
candidates of their choice but the
Republican map floods the district with
white Republican voters and takes that
opportunity
away those two takeaways make the
Republican map an unlawful map it's a
map that again judge Jones can and
should
reject I think in this moment it's
important to pause and recog recognize
our history to know where we've come
from to be honest about the mistakes and
sins of the past to ensure we do not
repeat
them since
1965 the state of Georgia was placed
under the pre-clearance requirement of
the Voting Rights Act due to a history
of discriminatory voting practices and
disenfranchisement of African-American
voters including but not limited to
literacy tests po TX taxes intimidation
and violence unfair registration
practices and
gerrymandering the pre-clearance
provision found in section five of the V
of the Voting Rights Act required
certain jurisdictions with a
demonstrated history of voting
discrimination to obtain Federal
approval or pre-clearance before
implementing any changes to their voting
laws or
procedures for nearly 50 years 50 years
Georgia voters were under the protection
of pre-clearance until five Republican
nominated Supreme Court Justices gutted
the Voting Rights Act in 2009 in the
2013 Shelby County V holder decision for
the first time since
1965 the state of Georgia was able to
draw their legislative maps without
first obtaining Federal approval what
did the Republican majority do well we
all know what happened to next two years
ago in 2021 Republicans many here in
this body passed unlawful maps for
congress the state senate and the State
House Maps struck down by a federal
judge for being drawn in a racially
discriminatory Manner and here we find
ourselves under court order to comply
with the Voting Rights Act to draw Fair
maps that do not discriminate against
any
Georgian unfortunately it seems we are
repeating the mistakes of our dark past
under Republican control of the state of
Georgia not only are these Maps
unlawful in order to cling to power and
maintain an unrepresentative majority
that does not reflect our great state
this map engages in blatant partisan
Jerry mandering with districts that very
clearly disregard traditional
redistricting principles of compactness
and communities of interest in multiple
districts to put it plainly it seems
Republicans are trying to remedy their
racial discrimination with partisan
gerrymandering again it seems
Republicans are trying to remedy their
racial discrimination with partisan
gerrymandering why because partisan
gerrymandering is legal according to
five Republic nominated Supreme Court
Justices who incorrectly decided that
claims of unconstitutional partisan
Jerry mandering are not subject to
Federal Court
review Jerry mandering whether it is
racial or partisan is deeply
undemocratic and unamerican because it
undermines the principles of a fair
representation and distorts the
Democratic process the Distortion of
electoral outcomes such as a
congressional map that creates nine
Republican and five Democratic districts
in a 50-50 swing state that elected a
Democratic president and two Democratic
United States senators and back-to-back
elections erodes the confidence of
American voters it undermines the
foundational Democratic principle of one
person one vote this manipulation
Fosters greater polarization and
partisanship that ultimately makes our
nation
weaker it is sad to see that the
Republican Party The Party of Abraham
Lincoln who freed the slaves has become
the party of trump the party of election
denialism and Insurrection the party of
racial discrimination and now
gerrymandering I hope y'all find your
way back I hope y'all get through your
Civil War and I hope the anti-democracy
authoritarian faction of your party is
expelled
in a two-party system I welcome the
competition of ideas to see who can best
serve the people and perfect our Union
by ensuring the promise of Freedom
equality and justice to every
American unfortunately as demonstrated
by this unlawful map it seems the
Republican party is doubling Down On
Again repeating the mistakes of the past
and pursuit of power the blatant
disregard for existing law that protects
majority minority districts in Georgia
demonstrates an intent to once again
attack the Voting Rights Act by
narrowing its
protections it is
unfortunate that as a Native Sun Georgia
as a Native Son Of Georgia born and
raised I have had to repeatedly come
down to this well over the past seven
years to fight back against Republican
attacks against our democracy attacks
against the fundamental freedoms and
rights
of my fellow Georgians against their
right to vote and in this case their
freedom to elect their candidate of
choice Georgians deserve better we can
do better than this unlawful Republican
map that puts partisan politics before
the citizens of Georgia that puts
political party before our
country in the words of John LS
democracy is not a state it is an act
today let us act in the best interest of
all Georgians by voting no to this
unlawful map that undermines the freedom
of our fellow citizens to elect their
candidate of choice thank you Mr Speaker
I yeld the
well will park has yielded the
well minority leader James Beverly is
recognized to speak to the bill leader
Beverly
thank you Mr
Speaker uh before I get started I want
to clear the
record something that the chairman of
the redistricting committee
said and that is that we had ample
opportunity to present our
map
the reality is is that you put an
artificial
timetable on how we had to move through
this
process the reality is is that it is not
up to the Georgia house Democratic
caucus to print maps to get the map
coincided with a LC number it is up to
leg Council in the reapportionment
office that did not
happen I think you did it in good faith
I think the Republicans did it in good
good faith but if you just extended the
time just a little bit
more we could have made it work where we
had an opportunity to present our map
which we believe is the best map for
Georgia at this particular time that
it's that it's
equal and that it's
just but that did not
happen what is the rush to
judgment a couple of years ago I
remember sharing with you that although
Abraham Lincoln was not necessarily my
favorite
President there are notable quotes that
speak to the heart of
democracy one being stand with anybody
that stands right stand with him while
he is right and part with him when he
goes
wrong my dear colleagues I stand once
again to say the Democratic caucus must
part ways with our Republican and
colleagues as you will your majority
power to push through what we believe to
be an illegal map in order to maintain
power at the expense of our fellow
Georgians today as a leader of the
democratic caucus I stand before you not
merely in political
capacity but as a custodian of a
legacy a legacy that is steeped in a
struggle for equality and and
Justice we're gathered here to
deliberate on a matter of immense
significance the rejin of our
state's legislative his house
districts now this historic moment that
we find ourselves in right
now is an opportunity to write
historical wrongs and to pave the way
for a future that honors the diverse
voices of our great
state an opportunity to remedy some of
the wrongs that have been particularly
directed toward our africanamerican
electorate those who have been
historically
disenfranchised stalled from having
equal access and opportunity to vote and
select their candidate of the
choice and are justly targeted by
placing barriers and stumbling blocks in
their way listen over the past decade
there has been a great migration if
y'all have not realized this there been
a great migration back to Georgia a
migration of Black Folk who came from
the Northeast back to God's country
Georgia there's also been a migration of
people of different nations colors and
Creeds who have come to Georgia because
they seek a better
opportunity and the reality is in that
opportunity they move into districts
that potentially they wouldn't have
moved into a 100 years
ago but they have and they moved into
these districts and they need
representation that's what the judge
ordered that this group of folk who
moved and migrated around the state of
Georgia should have
representation and the Republican map
decided we'll skirt around that just a
little bit to protect potentially some
of our
members I'm going to say a quote by Dr
King and I think now is appropriate to
say
this as I continue to deliver my speech
but I can hear him saying to America and
I'll say to the Republicans in this
caucus in this house our house today
you're too
arrogant and unless you change your ways
I God will rise up and break the
backbone of your
power and place it in the hands of a
nation that doesn't even know God's
name be
still and know that God is
God georg's history while Rich and
multifaceted Bears the scars of past
marred by racial Injustice
particularly in the realm of voting
rights the disenfranchisement of black
voters through mechanisms such as pole
taxes literacy test and the white
primary was just a denial of rights was
not just a denial of rights but a denial
of
dignity it is in this context that again
Dr King said our lives begin to end the
day we become silent about things that
matter this
matters
as my learned attorneys will
say reasonable Minds can
disagree but this is the judge's
order we ought to
comply we should have five
additional black districts where black
folk can vote now y'all have heard this
that oh the Democrats created four
districts it's foolishness we created
Five we created Five according to the
judge's
order and to my attorney colleagues the
reference would be Bartlett versus
Strickland as president case law that
talks about plurality districts we did
that we can keep going further Cooper
versus Harris there's a whole litania
case law that said what we created was a
fifth district so please please guys
start with the
foolishness in fact our districts are
almost carbon copies of the district
that judge Jones approved in his order
District 145 is a new majority minority
District located in Bib and hon counties
that is a carbon copy a carbon copy of
the district that judge Jones approved
we didn't move a block not one
block District 149 is a new majority
minority District in bi in the black
belt now if y'all don't know what the
black belt is is where um where
slaves that's the culmination of where
slaves were the black belt is where I
live making bib Twigs Wilkerson County
Balwin counties that only deviates a few
census blocks from the districts that
judge Jones approved those folk we need
representation 100 years is
enough and why did we move those few
census blocks here's why we moved them
to protect our Republican
colleague who represents
milleville who would have otherwise been
put in that new Democratic
leaning
District district 117 is a new majority
minority District in Henry County that
also is a carbon copy a carbon copy of
the m majority minority District that
judge Jones
approved District 61 and our map is a
new majority minority District in
Douglas and Cobb counties that is also
carbon
copy of what judge
Jones approved and finally District 74
is a new majority minority District in
Henry and spalon counties that satisfies
judge Jones's order for a fifth new
opportunity District in that
area I'm want to pause for a second
because
that
district there would be one Republican
member who would be sacrificed in that
District
potentially but we don't know what that
District would vote for because through
this political Jerry am manding y'all
moved it so that white Republicans could
vote for that
member this Great Migration I've learned
one thing and one thing only if you can
move where you want to move you
move but we should not be moving
people at
all to satisfy the need of a
representative if you don't like where
you live
move simple
if you don't like the district that
you're representing right now move and
let somebody who represents that
District step
in it should not be on us to make the
people go with us we should represent
the people where we are and that
District that one District the sacrifice
of that one person is going to put us
all in Jeopardy because of the ripple
effect that you did to the rest of the
members in this house and the judge a
special master has to draw a
map because of the ripple effect that
you created trying to protect one you
sacrificed the
whole now when the special Master
decides to draw this map which we
believe will happen because not only did
you uh not comply with his order you
broke the
law
you broke the
law because Coalition majority minority
districts are
protected and it's gone on for 20 years
or so it's protected so you can't say we
complied and break the law it's not how
America works it's certainly not how
Georgia works and it's certainly not
what judge Jones
order
what I would say to you and and in
conclusion is
this the Civil Rights Movement which
found fertile ground in the heart of
Georgia was a testament to the
unyielding Spirit of those who fought
for
justice the Voting Rights Act of 1964
65 emerged from this struggle it was a
Beacon of
Hope the task of reining our Maps we
must do so Within acute awareness of our
past and a Resolute commitment to
Equitable and a just
future to my
colleagues I Echo the words of President
Lyon B Johnson the vote is the most
powerful instrument ever devised by man
for breaking down
Injustice we have have decisions to make
now won't T cuz I know y'all are under a
time
crunch but this is the time to do what's
right to contemplate the reality of
where we go from here as a state of
Georgia the number one state to do
business unless you poor and you get
sick but we'll deal with that next
week this is our time to say to Georgia
to be
Resolute in this moment to say we hear
you and if we want to represent you then
we stand firm on the ideals and
principles of Georgia and
Justice equality and
fairness to my Republican colleagues you
have a few moments please don't violate
the trust of the Georgians who moved
here looking for a better opportunity
because you wish to protect one member
Mr Speaker I yield the
well the gentleman has yielded the
well minority minority leader
Beverly now we'll move on to those in
favor of the proposition hb1 ex Rec
recognize chair lady Camp to speak to
the
bill good morning thank you Mr Speaker
and and thank you members representative
VI yield I forgot to tell you you have
up to one hour that will be allocated to
those speaking in favor I hope you don't
take that long no sir I will not thank
you for that good morning members and Mr
Speaker um when I qualified to run for
my house seat March of 2020 of course it
was with the map that was current and
then we redistricted in 2021 so I
qualified on another District map March
of 2022 now I will have the opportunity
to qualify again on a third map March of
2024 this time in a district where I am
paired with another member of my own
party who is my friend and respected
colleague three different District maps
in the course of four years that's a
lot this situation deeply saddens me
because I truly care about the people I
represent working diligently to know and
meet the needs of the citiz citizens who
place their trust in me in each election
it is my honor to represent the interest
of Lamar Pike and Upson counties and a
privilege to serve in this role these
counties each have individual unique
needs and challenges that I am committed
to represent here under the gold
Dome unfortunately to meet the
requirements set forth in the detailed
order by judge Jones regarding the 2021
redistricting drastic changes had to
happen in many districts my district is
a prime example emotions cannot rule in
this important task with a looming
deadline there is a judge's order with a
specific set of instructions to the
general assembly for the requirements
for the new house Maps which hb1 X
before today meets I observe and follow
the law and court orders I'm sure
everyone in this room does the same
there are three branches of government
for this very reason the judges order is
not up for debate today it is if we as a
body are going to comply with the order
is for this reason I'm voting yes on
house redistricting bill
hb1 and I ask for your favorable
consideration on this Bill thank
you Mr Speaker I yield The Well the lady
has yielded the well thank
you chair now recognizes uh
representative Sue Hong to speak to the
bill one of the governor's floor
leaders representative
Hong thank you Mr Speaker and good
morning colleagues I stand before you
this morning to speak in favor of
chairman leverett's House Bill
1ex the right to vote stands as a
Cornerstone a fundamental pillar upon
which our society rests as the Supreme
Court said and y wo versus Hopkins in
1886 the right to vote is regarded as a
fundamental political right because it
is preservative of All
rights unlike many of you I wasn't born
with the right to vote in the United
States as an immigrant I had to wait my
time I had to take a test to become a
citizen before I could vote so I
understand the tremendous importance of
voting and having my voice heard with my
vote voting matters because it's the way
every person's voice is heard regardless
of background or
circumstance voting matters because it's
the power each person has to elect their
representatives and voting matters
because it's how we can shape the
trajectory of our community and our
state and when the Supreme Court said
the right to vote is preservative of all
of our other rights it meant just
that without the right to vote our other
rights can quickly disappear and we
jeopardize our free
Society now this body worked hard to
create District maps in
2021 that fairly represented all
voters as I look out at this body of
Representatives I see a diverse group of
Representatives with backgrounds and
beliefs who I truly believe represent
their constituents very
well unfortunately and respectfully
judge Jones did not agree with this
current body of
Representatives and as an attorney I do
understand that when a judge tells you
in detail to do something in an order
you
comply judge Jones specifically stated
to create five majority black districts
not opportunity districts or Coalition
districts or crossover districts
specifically five majority black
districts and there's a reason why
judges put specifics in their order and
you must
comply chairman leverett's house Bell
1ex map does just that it complies with
everything that the judge required of us
it also upholds our other traditional
redistricting principles things like
ensuring that community of interests are
properly represented and
addressed and reducing the number of
County splits on the plan and using
Precinct boundaries that lessen the
burden on Election
officials
hb1 map upholds the principle principles
of equal representation and ensures each
voters can have their voices
heard therefore I urge you members of
this house in joining me to vote Yes for
House Bill 1ex thank you Mr Speaker and
I yield The
Well the lady has yielded the
well that
concludes those that signed up to speak
both and in favor of and opposed this
time we'll move on we do not have a
Minority Report we will move on to the
chairish time who have a total of 20
minutes Mr
chairman and I hope you don't take that
long you talked quite a while
earlier chairman Leverett is recognized
to speak to the Bill thank you Mr
Speaker I would say I'll be brief but as
an attorney I know that doesn't carry a
lot of credulity
well it was interesting to me if I could
just respond that we were accused of
being overtly and shamelessly partisan
but the most partisan comments I heard
coming from the podium in this chamber
came from members of the opposing party
not from anyone who is in the the
majority
party um and I would submit if we truly
wanted to be overtly and excessively
partisan we would have paired entirely
members of the opposition but we didn't
do that we tried to share some of that
of that burden if you
will now up to
um as far as some of the comments about
timeliness I mean I I the only thing I
will say is I think we know the rules
and we know that to submit a bill to
redistri to to present a plan to
redistricting you have to have a bill
you got to draw the bill we've had the
order for about a month now we all knew
this was coming so I I I I don't know
what more to do about that well frankly
I do you could allow a motion without a
document and that's what I did in
committee yesterday and nobody made the
motion I indicated I was going to
entertain such a motion and no one made
it without a document and the document
that was proposed today didn't do that
even so again I I think I've stated my
position there and as far scump that's
all I have to say about that
um now the only other plan that was
properly submitted to the committee was
presented yesterday and the presenters
acknowledged that the plan did not
create five majority black districts as
the order required just if you'd roll
that beautiful um order footage this is
from page 509 of Judge Jones's order the
remedy involves an additional majority
black congressional district in West
Metro two additional Senate districts in
South Metro we're getting to that later
two additional majority black house
districts in South Metro Atlanta wanted
additional majority black house district
in West Metro Atlanta and two additional
majority black house districts in and
around making biip our plan the hb1 ex
does that I don't think judge Jones
could be clear about it I do not want to
be in a hearing in a remedial phase
having to explain to judge Jones how I
thought he really meant something else
than that that's just not a good
position to be in I'm not an expert in
the Voting Rights Act but I know a
little bit about Judges and and I don't
think they enjoy it when you either
disregard their orders or try to
construe them in a manner that that is
unreasonable and when they're unhappy
that usually falls upon the person who
did the the improper construing our plan
complies with that with that order it
complies with that provision and that's
clear guidance that judge Jones kindly
gave
us um now I I heard some some comment
about how these some of the districts in
our plan didn't actually comply with the
order because they weren't majority
black but they were every one of them
was um we' we've vetted that with Miss
Wright we've confirmed the data and they
comply
um and the argument
was was made that we somehow broke the
law by complying with the order or by
not doing something else other than what
judge Jones required
well in the defense of the people making
that argument I think what they are
saying is Judge Jones's order is not
exactly in compliance with the Voting
Rights Act he misconstrued the Voting
Rights Act so we ought to do what we
believe should be done instead of what
he ordered I don't want to go into court
taking that position I just don't think
that's a wise approach to getting the
plans
approved um and we we retained every
majority District we have it does say
additional and we created Five
more finally just on a personal note I I
I
acknowledge you know redistricting judge
herd used to say about re about well it
reminds me of a quote judge herd a
former member of this body used to say
about taking castor
oil he said one of the greatest things
about being administered doses of castor
oil is it reminds you of the Finer
Things in life like the times que the
doses of castor
oil that's that's
redistricting I wish we didn't have to
do this I really wish we didn't but
we're we've ordered and I I'm I have
tried as chairman to comply with that
order in the best way I knew how taking
advice of the reapportionment office and
of counsel and complying with the order
and complying with the Voting Rights
Act and I would not not propose
something that I felt harmed any one of
you in any
way unless I felt it was necessary to
comply with a court order I don't
believe one can be terribly sentimental
when you're trying to comply with a
court order the people in this
chamber mean a lot to me
personally and I'm being sincere about
that we when we were doing this two
years ago I went home on the weekend and
my mother passed
unexpectedly and I couldn't come back
Monday and Tuesday and so
I stayed home
obviously till we had the funeral and I
I think the day I
mentioned that to one person in this
chamber
within
seconds my phone lit up with texts of
condolences
so much so that it basically you
couldn't hold the phone it shook off the
table this body means a lot to
me every one of you mean a lot to me
even when we
disagree the thing I really appreciate
about the people in this body is we
disagree and we do it civy and we still
remain
friends at least we tried to and I know
in this process it's tough it's easy for
me to sit up here my district hasn't
been changed it hasn't been
touched so that's easy for me to
say but but that you folks mean a lot to
me when she passed one of you wrote me a
note a personal note that is one of the
kindest things I have
ever received didn't know you that well
at that
time and I really appreciate it I still
appreciate
it and I appreciate this body and the
thought that I would intentionally try
to draw somebody out for a reason other
than complying with an order is just an
a to me and I would hope you would all
know me
better that's what we have to do the
order the the house bill 1X complies
with that order we don't have a lot of
time we need to get this
done and I ask that you approve and vote
in favor of House Bill 1 ex so we can
move on to the rest of the business we
have to finish by the court imposed
deadline thank you Mr Speaker I yield
the
well gentleman's yielded the well
there's no doubt of your sincerity or of
your work ethic or your hard work thank
you for working on this proposition for
all members of the house that concludes
all of those
that had allocated time to speak to the
bill so at this time
members if you'll come to the chamber
if you're outside the chamber we're ask
you to come to the chamber Mr clerk why
don't you ring the
bell
is there any objection to the previous
question being
ordered chair here's none the previous
question is ordered is there any
objection to agreeing to the report of
the committee which was favorable to the
passage of the bill chair has none the
report of the committee is agreed to
shall this bill now pass all in favor of
the passage of the bill will vote Yes
all those opposed will vote no and the
clerk will unlock the
machine for what purpose does a lady
from the 93rd representative Carter
rise parliamentary inquiry SP your state
your inquiry first apology I had to
wrong button pushed when I wanted to ask
a question earlier so uh the question
because the the the author of the bill
states that it's unintentional but if
anyone was to look at house district
93 on this new map is been called a dead
cat it is the most erroneous Jerry
Mandarin that I probably have
seen you take a district you go east you
go north and then you go west and then
there there a district sandwiched in
between I would hope that everyone would
vote no cuz this map is not only
disenfranchising the members the voters
of DEC Rockdale Newton and ninet it is
affecting our entire state so this map
should go back to the starting point
because I think that's the lady's
question yeah yeah that's the question
how 93 alone should send it back well I
appreciate the lady's
Viewpoint and I'm sure the lady believes
everything she just
said the lady from the
56 is recognized for what purpose to she
rise represented mayor parliamentary
inquiry State your inquiry thank you Mr
Speaker isn't it true that the judge's
order is not about creating Democrat
districts or repu Republican districts
it's about creating majority black
districts is that not true I think
there's true is it not further I know
that to be true is it not further true
to my colleague is this a further
inquiry further inquir if I may Mr
Speaker you recognized is it not further
true to sit here and say that
Republicans are being racist is
certainly not true as I am a Republican
and I am certainly not racist I take
offense to such statements is that a
question do you have a question if not
that is my is that not true I'm sure if
the lady so States that's what the lady
certainly believes thank you Mr Speaker
we're going to take a couple of more and
then we're going to close this vote I
know this lady has
um Wanted the opportunity to make a
comment
to speak so um chair recognizes lady
from the 108th house District
representative Clark representative
Clark for what purpose do you rise thank
you Mr Speaker parliamentary inquiry
State your inquiry Mr Speaker is it not
true that there are many iterations of
maps that could be drawn that would not
pair six members of the democratic party
together is that not true Mr Speaker I'm
I'm sure the lady has studied the map
and studied the state and believes what
she says is true thank you for your
point we have one more and let's see we
have let's hear from some history from
someone who's been around for a couple
of these for what purpose does the
gentleman from the 167th house district
rise chairman parliamentary inquiry
State your inquiry isn't it true that
the last map that a republican majority
in this house
Drew my district went from being a part
of Liberty County to Tiny parts of six
counties going all the way from the
coast in McIntosh County through Liberty
long Brian bulock to the very top of
kler County to the Emanuel County
Line isn't that true Mr
Speaker I'm sure I remember that
and I'm glad you had that District when
you were a younger man because you would
have had trouble covering all of that
these days so but you do a great job of
representing your District I'm not
saying that so I'm sure the gentleman
speaks the truth we're going to take one
last inquiry here I'm going to recognize
the gentleman from the 143rd the
minority leader of this
house thank you Mr Speaker parliamentary
inquiry State your inquiry is it not
true that the public democrat atic map
house
map only
created issues with 23 house
districts is that not true I'm sure if
the gentleman so States I won't comment
on that but I'm sure that's what the
gentleman believes yes is it also not
true Mr Speaker that the Republican map
created problems for 50 plus house
districts is that not
true
if that's a question finish your inquiry
then I'll make a comment Mr Speaker the
inquiry is this in the in the Democratic
house the public map that is
public that we did not couple Democratic
members in the Georgia House of
Representatives is that not
true with the public map I'm not privy
to your map right now so I'll have to
take your word that that's what you did
lastly Mr Speaker is it not true that
that it was
unnecessary absolute unnecessary to
couple Democratic members in the Georgia
house Democratic caucus with the map the
Republicans Drew because the judge was
very specific in the regions in which he
identified is that not true Mr Speaker
I'm sure the gentleman believes that I
said that was the last one but I think
if I'm going to hear from the minority
leader also need to hear from the
majority Le gentleman from the 104th
house district leader estra
parliamentary inquiry stay that inquiry
Mr speaker is not true that the publicly
released map as I understand it was the
map that the minority leader presented
in committee and that was presented on
the second day of committee when he was
given an opportunity to present the
first day and that from a study of the
map it was acknowledged by all involved
that it failed to comply with the
requirement from from the judge that we
just saw projected on the board to
create five districts as outlined it
only created four and therefore did not
comply with the specific order as
written by the judge is that not
true well I'm sure the gentleman
understands what he's saying and he
believes believes what he's saying and
so thank you for your inquiry I'll make
one last statement and we're going to
close this
out it has been my intent
from when this process began a few a
month ago or longer in that time frame
not quite a month ago to comply with
judge Jones's
order and I also
know that I have many friends that are
serving in this General Assembly right
now in this
house and my friends on both sides of
the aisle have been
impacted by this redistricting
it's not not my choice to be here but
we're going to be here and we're doing
the work that's been assigned to us
we're going to comply with this with
judge Jones's
order we're going to create new black
majority districts in this state that's
what we were told to do that's what this
map does I feel comfortable with this
map and we'll move forward so with that
I thank all the members have voted all
members

machines on the passage of the bill the

Senate we'll move on to afternoon
orders we have some afternoon orders I'm
going to begin the afternoon orders with
a very somber afternoon order and I'm
going to invite up chairman Martin
representative
gamble
nothing and representative
Martinez I'll just preface
this and chairman Williamson I think we
all need to stand we've U recently lost
a reverend member of this
house the Reverend chairman Lyn
Walker your recognized to
speak and you gentlemen can all make a
comment his um service here was
exemplary and what a fine fine man he
was a fine gentleman who served with
many of us in this
house chairman Martin thank you Mr
Speaker
um as we all know we got an email from
the speaker's office yesterday that we
lost a former member uh chairman Lynn
Walker and and of the gentleman are
standing with me I'm I perhaps on a
personal basis uh didn't
know Lynn as well as they did but when
the email came across yesterday and and
we've lost a number of our
colleagues in recent years but when the
email came across yesterday I was
sitting in a chair at
4:17 at at almost exactly the same place
that Lynn Walker sat on on his last days
you know in the in the capital before he
retired in 2011
and some reason for some reason at that
point in that time when I read that it
just struck
me the loss that that we feel for for
our colleagues down here and that we
feel throughout our community and it
made me think and and it I quite frankly
got it me up me mixed up with Randy
Nicks and Lynn Walker but but both those
men have have left us and come back and
done devotionals and and one of those
devotionals we they talked about
Saturdays and then we we've We've joked
and and we're all excited about our
Saturday tomorrow but I want to use that
as an example
because grasping that with how many
Saturdays we have
left to be intentional what you decide
to do on that Saturday and every day for
that matter but on that Saturday and how
fortunate we are if if God lets me wake
up tomorrow and get to four o'clock I'll
get to go with with my sons and
grandsons and family to a ball game that
I hope they'll remember after I'm long
gone but I go back to what LM Walker
talked about when he was about being
intentional with what we do and that
just struck me so much because what we
just did is very important 11 million
Georgians that that's fine but what you
do on Saturdays with your family and in
your community and what Lynn Walker did
down here was important but what he did
for his church and his parishioners and
his family by being
intentional every day is so much more
important so Mr Speaker I just wanted to
share that and and ask all of us to look
inside and look to our family members
and be thankful for the time we have
because time is fleeting that we be
intention when we leave here and take
our time and and enjoy it we rush around
too
much um so I would yield at this time to
these gentlemen that knew knew Lyn
Walker much better than me but not one
of them was more impacted by Lynn Walker
than I was and and I hope you'll just
take that to heart and be intentional
when you leave here on your Saturdays
and every day because when we wake up
this Sunday morning regardless of what
happens in that mercedesbenz
Dome everybody in this building have one
less Saturday so make the best of it Mr
Speaker i y the
well chairman Williamson thank you Mr
Speaker one of the reasons I'm standing
here today is because of Lynn Walker I
met him when I was in my business uh in
my business career when he came by and
knocked on my door and told me he was
running to be my state representative
along with my area of Walton County at
the time I found out quickly that he was
was a man of integrity he was an
encourager and and so many more things
uh because he was a man of God and I
shared it to breakfast this morning that
I know and those of you how many of us
serve with Lyn Walker it's not going to
be a tremendous amount but every one of
you your hands up know what a fine man
he was he treated everybody with dignity
and respect um and I shared with some
people at a breakfast this morning that
I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that
Lynn Walker is with the Lord Jesus
Christ right now that he is fully healed
and he's in his Heavenly home that all
of us should aspire to by following the
words of Pastor Tate this morning put
Jesus first in your life he he gave it
all for us so Mr Speaker um this body
should uh finally remember the service
of Lynn his legacy for the people of the
state of Georgia Mr Speaker I yield the
well let's hear from um one of our Deans
Ray excuse me repres um representative
Williams thank you thank you Mr
Speaker there were many things that Lynn
Walker and I disagreed on but there was
one thing we all agreed on and that was
that he loved the Lord his heart was
right he was a man of
integrity I spent uh the first 11 years
of my tenure here
working in the
prayer caucus with him when we started
it up on the fourth floor well it was on
the fourth floor when I got here it was
started up there and then we did the
Sunday service and he asked me the year
he was leaving if I would continue the
prayer caucus which I have tried to do
since
2011
and I I I I feel confident
and in where he's rejoicing
today for the scripture says precious in
the sight of the Lord is the death of
one of his Saints and Lynn Walker from
from a spiritual standpoint was a saint
for those of you if for no other reason
to honor the legacy of Lynn Walker and
The God he so loved I would come honor
him at the prayer convocation that he so
long and led so well thank you Mr
Speaker are you thank you representative
representative Martinez thank you so
much Mr Speaker um I did not get a
chance to uh uh serve with Len Walker as
