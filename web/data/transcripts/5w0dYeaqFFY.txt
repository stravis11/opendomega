TRANSCRIPT
----------
For those who can think of nothing else but the upcoming election, let me share a word
of advice.
If you fail to listen to the people, you will fail to earn their vote.
So let's stay focused on the future, where anyone who wants to work for a better life
can achieve it here in the best state for opportunity.
This morning Governor Brian Kemp advised lawmakers to keep their focus on the needs of
Georgians in this election year.
Good evening and welcome to day three of the Georgia Legislative session.
I'm Donna Lowry in Atlanta.
We'll have much more on the eggs and issues breakfast at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium this
morning later in the show.
Show leaders in the House give us an idea of their policy goals.
And in recent years, the General Assembly has lowered the individual income tax rate.
A Senate committee studied how to eliminate it over the summer.
And we'll hear more about that.
We'll talk to two members of the committee, including the chair.
First, we lead off of what happened today with our Capitol correspondent, Sarah Callis.
Hi, Donna. Lawmaker started the day bright and early at the annual Exan Issues Legislative
Breakfast. Legislators and business leaders gathered and discussed economic priorities
on the field at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, which will host the 2026 FIFA World Cup.
We got our first look at Governor Brian Camp's budget priorities at his final Exan Issues
Legislative Breakfast. As the state's top executive, Camp says the state will invest 1.8
Billion dollars in new express lanes in the most congested sections of I-75 in Henry County.
Currently 45 to 60% of commuters can't get in the express lanes when they need them the most.
This funding will enable G-Dod and Serta to address those issues head on.
Our initial estimates indicate that once these express lanes are completed,
As much as 70% more vehicles will be able to pass through that corridor during the rush hours.
That's a great return on investment for our state.
Local road improvements will also be in the budget, Camp Said.
He also announced new funds to curb homelessness in Atlanta, ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup.
Known as the homelessness response grant, the state will make a one-time investment of $50 million.
that will be coupled with other funds
from public, private, and non-profit partners
to launch this initiative.
Through very targeted use of funds,
this grant will act as a force multiplier
to complement the good work already underway
by Mayor Dickens and other champions
on this challenging issue.
Awards will go to local governments
and non-profit organizations
addressing street-level homelessness in Georgia.
And it will ensure that every stakeholder,
every stakeholder has equal skin in the game.
We will also see more workforce readiness
in this legislative session.
Camp says.
In the coming days, my administration will propose
the education and workforce strategy at.
It will ensure the unprecedented collaboration
between the University and technical college systems,
the Georgia Department of Education, and others live on,
Long after many of us today are no longer in the positions that we currently occupy.
Leaders of the House and Senate also took to the stage, emphasizing that affordability
is this year's theme.
Lieutenant Governor Bert Jones said the state will focus on limiting property tax and
reducing the income tax this session.
We'll concentrate on income tax, lower in it and property tax, getting a handle on
that, looking at insurance costs and everything else.
are all things that are on people's mind right now. And so as legislators, it's our
responsibility to focus on those issues that are, you know, concerning our constituents.
Republican senators say they will put forth legislation to gradually eliminate the state
income tax. Speaker up the House, John Burns, said the House will also double down on
reducing property taxes, but through the homestead exemption.
The House will put forward legislation enabling the elimination of the homestead property tax
statewide.
Burns also said that literacy and workforce readiness remain priorities of the House.
He said lawmakers will push for an optometry school in Georgia.
Georgia does not have an optometry school and we know that access to vision care is so
important as we continue our efforts to strengthen literacy.
because that's what's more important to learning to read,
what's more important to learn and to read,
than ability to see in the classroom, right?
He also said the House will introduce legislation
to put a reading coach in every elementary school
in the state.
After the event, Georgia Chamber CEO Chris Clark
gave his perspective on the business impact
of several hot issues at the Capitol,
like reducing tax incentives on some industries.
I think some of that is worth us taking a look at.
We do have some outdated tax incentives
that are still on the books,
but quite frankly, when you look at that total amount out there,
it only comes around $3 billion every year,
so it's not 13 or 14 or 17 billion
that's enough to make everything up.
But I think at the end of the day,
even those states that don't have income taxes
still have tax incentives.
The difference is, those states don't have
an anti-gratuity clause.
In Georgia, you can't give a grant directly to a company
to do an expansion to come to Georgia.
We don't allow that here.
And so we really do use those tax credits differently.
Lawmakers advocating for income tax elimination,
say reducing some tax incentives will help make up for the loss
in income tax revenue.
After the event, lawmakers filed back to the Capitol.
The House and Senate both met without passing any bills.
Tomorrow, we will hopefully learn more details
about the governor's proposals in his final state
of the state address.
That's my Capitol report.
Back to you, Donna.
Thank you, Sarah.
On this day three of the session,
we continue to learn what to expect
during the legislative session.
Two of the lawmakers who will help lead
what happens join us.
House Majority Leader,
Republican Representative Chuck,
Abstration of Mulberry,
he was first elected to the House of Representatives in 2013.
And House Minority Whip,
Democratic Representative Sam Park,
of Lawrenceville,
his first election to the House was in 2016.
Welcome the lawmakers to both of you.
Thank you so much.
We're going to talk about priorities.
So, leader registration for a couple of years now,
the speaker has talked about giving Georgia residents
a break when it comes to property taxes.
It tells us if this is the year, that's going to happen.
Well, thanks for having me, Donna.
Affordability is the big issue this year.
And our speaker has outlined the elimination
of the homestead property tax state-wide.
And that legislation is to be introduced
this legislative session, Georgians are paying so much
in property taxes as property values continue to climb.
And so for their homes where they live,
the elimination of that property tax
would be a huge savings.
Okay, we'll get more on a affordability in a moment.
So talk about that when it comes to taxes
with the Democrats.
We're certainly interested in looking forward
to seeing what the Republican caucus will be proposing
when it comes to property taxes.
I think leader of Stration mentioned a key aspect
that I think there needs to be more focus,
which is these increased valuations,
these increased property values
in which the underlying cause is the lack of housing supply.
You know, over the past seven to eight years,
we've seen the median average price of a home
go from about $200,000 and more than $450,000.
So I think while looking at property tax reform is important,
we also have to do what we can't expand
the supply before the housing.
Okay, let's move on to education.
always big at the capital every year during the legislative session.
What are you talking about with the Republican caucus?
So childhood literacy is a major issue for this legislative session.
Speaker John Burns outlined in his speech this morning that
a top priority of the state house is literacy, particularly looking at the third
grade reading level when only one third of kids statewide are reading
proficiently at grade level.
That's a major concern, particularly with the spending and
and focus that we've had in education in the classroom literacy coaches who can assist
teachers in following a curriculum which is proven to be effective for those kids is
so critical for the long-term development of the child, for ultimately issues like workforce
development and career readiness.
Yeah.
So that's a big thing with the Republican caucus, with the Democratic caucus.
With respect to education, you know, the Democratic caucus, we really look at it from the
spectrum from cradle to career.
Certainly there will be bipartisan support
to ensure that we're investing more in literacy.
But with respect to K through 12 education,
I think there's some disagreement
between the two parties.
Of course, over the past few years,
we've had a big debate over vouchers,
in which just last year we sent $140 million
toward private schools and vouchers
that really undermine especially rural school districts
and their ability to teach kids.
The last piece I'd mention on education
is student loan debt.
You know, Georgia now ranks third
with the highest average student loan debt in the country.
And of course, Senator Nan Orrick did an excellent job
over the off session in doing a study committee
on needs-based aid for higher education,
and which hopefully we'll be able
to move something on that issue as well.
And she'll be on the show later.
So, any more, anything more on education you wanna mention?
I think education is the top priority right now.
I think that the ability for every child in Georgia
have to world-class education and for us to meet those standards for reading are issues
that I expect will really advance this session.
Okay.
Let's get into health care.
Let's talk about the fact that Democrats have for a while now pushed for Medicaid expansion.
Do you expect to do that again?
We will be introducing additional legislation, including obtaining a fiscal note to understand
the true impact in cost, a full Medicaid expansion, but of course this is not a pilot.
more than 40 states that have expanded Medicaid. It has lowered the costs of private health insurance
premiums because we're expanding the pool lowering the risk. And, you know, of course, you know,
right now, healthcare prices are skyrocketing in large part because of the federal government and
the Republican majority, in which, you know, we're seeing healthcare premiums for those increasing
by $1,000, $2,000.
Already about 190,000 Georgians with ACA plans have fallen off.
And so it's a very, very concerning situation.
Especially when we're looking at tax cuts
that provide an average benefit of approximately $250
to $300, that's fantastic.
But if your health care prices are going up by $1,000, $2,000,
the affordability crisis continues.
So you'll expect some legislation in that area.
What about with health care, with your caucus?
Well, a lot of issues have been raised, a lot to unpack.
I'll just say this, the affordability issues
is a major focus, accessibility,
and affordability in health care,
particularly rural health care access
continues to be a major priority of the Georgia House.
And there are many measures which we've worked
to advance in that area.
I know that as we're discussing the costs
that Georgians are facing in these expensive times,
certainly in response to the skyrocketing inflation
caused by policies out of Washington DC over the past few years.
We're now in a position where we can, I think, actually address that with tax relief,
with insurance premium cost relief, with the study committee that we've had this year
legislation coming, and with reducing costs for first time home buyers to be able to afford
that first home, build long-term wealth through home ownership.
I know the speaker also talked about trying to increase the workforce in the health sector,
you know.
Absolutely.
So there have been new educational programs open across the state over the past few years,
training for healthcare workers so that we can meet the demand.
Certainly, as we have a population that requires additional healthcare workers.
Okay.
What else would you have on your plate?
I would say, you know, with respect to the healthcare workforce piece again, certainly
support the speakers focus on expanding the workforce.
There have been multiple studies that say that full Medicaid expansion would create 30,000
additional health care jobs in the state of Georgia.
So I think the best way, if that is a speaker's priority, is to, you know, work in a bipartisan
manner to expand Medicaid for Georgia.
I just have to address that.
Right now we're seeing policy out of Washington, D.C., talking about not funding commitments
that were made previously to states that did expand Medicaid.
in a terrific position financially right now because of the strong fiscal leadership of
Governor Brian Kemp and the Republicans in the General Assembly.
We don't have a huge hole in our budget that other states are facing.
We actually have reserves that make this state better prepared for any financial uncertainty
which may happen in the future.
Did you want to add to that?
Absolutely.
I think we have a historic surplus right now in which we're simply sitting on it rather
than investing in people.
You know, I appreciate the governor's interest in building out a highway, two billion dollars
in which I think the ground would not be broken until 2030.
How fantastic would it be if we invested $1.8 billion in the health of Georgia's today?
I'm expanding access to health care, I'm expanding access to childcare.
I think there's a lot the state of Georgia can do, but unfortunately under the current
leadership we haven't done that yet.
Okay.
Let's talk about any other priorities that we haven't talked about that you were looking
at.
So tax reduction is a major focus over the past few years.
The General Assembly has reduced the income tax by two tenths of a percent each year,
$800 million savings for Georgians.
And there's a proposal to do that again this year, actually bring the income tax rate
below 5%.
That's in addition to the property tax relief and a real focus on reducing insurance premiums.
That's healthcare insurance premiums, auto, mobile, homeowners insurance.
We've actually seen three carriers since the passage of legislation last year to reduce
rates and additional carriers are coming into the state.
Ultimately, more competition is going to drop down costs, which will help all Georgians.
Okay.
Anything else you want to add, Doug?
Data centers, I think, is something that we should certainly closely examine.
The cost of data centers, I think we're providing up to $470 million in tax credits every
single year in which 70% of data centers coming in Georgia would still remain.
Okay, unfortunately we're going to have to make that the final word but I thank you so much
both of you for being here and we're certainly going to keep up with everything.
Great idea.
Well Georgia joined nine other states and eliminated state income taxes coming up.
We'll talk to two senators who serve on a study committee looking into that issue.
You guys are really, really great.

We're going to look closely at a Senate study recommendation to eliminate income taxes.
me are Republican Senator Blake Tillerie of Vidalia. He has served in the state Senate since 2016
and is the Senate Chair of the Powerful Appropriations Committee. And Democratic Senator Nann
Oroch of Atlanta, she was elected to the Georgia Senate in 2006 after spending 10 terms in the House.
Welcome to you both to lawmakers. I appreciate having you here. So both of you has spent months
on the Georgia Senate Special Committee
for the elimination of Georgia's income tax.
So, Germantilary, I want to start with,
who did you have talk to you?
Well, who testified?
Well, hopefully saying the title is...
I know, that's the longest pass I know.
So, I think it makes a lot of sense for folks.
We had everyday Georgians come in and talk.
We had a police chief.
We had people who owned businesses.
We had a mom who was talking about childcare expenses.
And it turns out that it didn't take,
you didn't have to go very far to find out
that every day's origins are filling the affordability crunch in their pocket books daily.
And they're screaming for help.
And I'm listening.
You heard a lot too, Senator.
I did.
And actually I'd love to see some more experts than the ones that were brought in who have
been beating the drum against income tax for longer than some of us been alive.
the devil's in the details, okay?
And we'll see.
We're gonna get into some of those.
Okay, so we're gonna go through some of the highlights.
We show the flyer in the committee's executive summary
and have you both comment briefly on each one of them.
So let's start with, we recommend making the first $50,000
for individuals in $100,000 for joint filers,
completely tax-free beginning in 2027.
We also recommend reducing the state income tax rate
for all other families and businesses.
Chair Matilary?
Yeah, I mean, it speaks for itself.
What we have noticed is that the folks
at the bottom end are filling that affordability
crosses the most.
If you're making a million dollars a year,
you may be filling a crunch.
But you're making $100, $125,000 as a married couple,
making $50,000 individually.
You're trying to figure out how you're paying for gas,
groceries, childcare, your power bill.
If we can eliminate the income tax on that first $50,000,
That's $2,500 a year in a person making $50,000 pocket
every year.
You like it, Senator?
Well, the other side of that story
is that that cuts $16 billion out of our state budget.
And long term, I don't see how we can afford that when
we have high needs in every sector of funding childcare,
funding our prison system.
Every agency in the state is down.
We're not fully staffing our agencies.
And we've got our vulnerable children
in the foster system right now.
The $180 million in the red.
Okay, so let's talk about that.
Okay, I'm gonna let you talk about it.
I wanna get through some more, though.
Sure. First.
Another highlight.
These proposals completely eliminate
the state income tax on two thirds of all working
Georgians while drastically reducing the tax burden
on everyone else.
Right, under our plan, if you're making $50,000 or less,
your income tax liability is eliminated in Georgia.
If you're married filing jointly, in 2027, it's gone.
If you're married filing jointly,
your first $100,000 is exempt.
If you're making more than $100,000,
it's $5,190 in your pocket every single year
from now into eternity.
It's not just $250 a year, $500 a year.
It's forever.
What do you think?
Well, I think the proposal actually would dramatically
challenge us as a state to find the funding
that we need for so many underfunded responsibilities
that the state has towards its citizens.
OK.
Next, two thirds of individual taxpayers
would have no state income tax liability
under this proposal beginning in 2027.
No income tax two thirds.
Correct.
So in this plan, as we were going through debating and hearing from our colleagues on the
other side, one of the things they said is that all the benefits go to the rich.
We wanted to make sure that this benefit was applied equally to all Georgians.
And so what we did is said, let's exempt the first 50,000 if you're seeing along all Georgians,
100,000 if you're married on all Georgians regardless of your income.
And apply it across what that ends up doing, though, is if you're making less than $100,000,
it eliminates your income tax liability entirely.
That's two-thirds of Georgians.
There's no way you can say that this only benefits the rich when every family making
less than $100,000 now has zero state income tax liability.
Senator Orrah?
Well, the devil's in the details 74 percent of the benefit would go to people earning
six figures or more per year, $11.8 billion I think is what it would come in at.
Okay.
Let's get to the next one.
This proposal does not increase the sales tax nor creates property tax, nor does it
cut government services for Georgians.
Sherman Delory.
The folks who are talking about affordability but not willing to do anything about it will
always throw an excuse.
And the excuse that was thrown out this time is what the state is going to do is instead
of taking it out of your left pocket, they're going to grab it out of your right pocket instead.
And we said no we're not.
We're not going to charge a new sales tax.
We're not going to add a property tax, the state charges no property tax now.
How would we add that on?
And we developed a plan that literally answered those concerns, didn't raise a sales tax,
didn't put a tax on groceries, didn't charge a property tax, didn't majorly benefit the
wealthy if you'll find out in the first two years it's a $6 billion plan.
Over $4 billion goes to those making $100,000 unless.
We answer all those questions yet we still hear that affordability is an issue yet we're
not willing to do anything about it.
So where is the money coming from?
How are you replacing that money?
So you know I've chaired the budget now for seven, this will be my seventh term chair in the budget.
So I guess I'm uniquely qualified to talk about it.
Last year we brought in about $2 billion more in its expenses than revenue.
So there's $2 billion, the first year you need three.
If you move back from a cash standpoint where we've done bonds in the past, back to bonds,
you create about $700 million more.
The total cost is actually $5.87 billion.
That's about $2.9 a year.
There's your $2.9 to cover year one, in year two.
What we're suggesting is that all we should do is prioritize people over companies.
I heard Chris Clark say $3 billion a year on tax credits.
He's playing funny math.
He's not talking about the sales tax exemptions.
Let's add all those in.
We give away and corporate giveaways over $30 billion a year.
Take 10% of those.
You can eliminate Georgia's income tax on two-thirds of Georgians
and give every Georgian a break for every year until eternity.
I'll take that bet, throw me in that brow patch.
So, cutting back on some of these tax breaks,
but also the money that usually goes into that pot
at the end of the year that has the surplus,
you're saying that is some of the money you're talking about.
You're saying we brought in more revenue last year
than we had in the census?
We're going to apply it somewhere.
Let's apply it and give it back to the people
who sent it to begin with.
Okay. Well, you know, a person getting a tax refund
cannot go out and build the services they need
need for their disabled child.
We need to put money together as Georgians to have a state budget that's robust enough
to deal with.
We've got 7,000 families on the waiting list now with disabled children that cannot get services
and what we keep hearing from the Republicans is, well, there's not, we can't afford it.
There's not enough money for that.
There's not enough money for us to have financial aid for needy students to go to college.
not enough money for this. There's not enough money for that. And that's what the
word is that comes down, but yet you're going to really threaten half of the state budget
by doing away with income tax.
Your response?
We spend over $2 billion on mental health and developmental disabilities each year. We
spend 54% over $13 billion on education. There is no way you can say by looking at what
What we fund with health care making up 23% of our budget and education making up 54%
of our budgets that Georgia does not prioritize those areas.
What we need to prioritize now, though, is those families making less than $100,000 who
I don't consider wealthy.
That's your firefighters, your nurses, your police officers, your teachers, that we have
an opportunity to completely eliminate their income tax liability, why would we not do
it?
They're the budget guys, so not getting rid of things that people are used to right now,
after what you're looking for.
We've shown a way to do it in the current budget space.
What we have to get rid of is the corporate welfare and subsidies that we've been plotting
out for years.
I heard someone say earlier that the data tax credit is $470, know it's $740.
They transpose their numbers.
It was only $17 million years ago, so now it's $740 million.
You know we have a film tax break of $1.2 billion.
You start adding these up.
You only need 3 billion a year to eliminate Georgia's income tax.
It's there.
You just have to put people over companies.
So you would agree with the data centers, cutting the breaks to tax breaks to data centers?
That absolutely needs to be tackled.
Yes.
Because they got a tax break that they didn't need.
They would be here anyway without it.
Sure.
That's their place is to look for tax expenditures in the budget.
But we are one, the 48 states do financial aid for needy students to go to college.
In Georgia, we spend 1% of our financial aid on needy students to go to college.
So there are needs that should be funded that are not in our current budget, that should
be there.
And that's one example.
Our foster child system is very, very challenged.
Mental health, we're not beginning to scratch the surface of funding the needs for mental
health for both adults and for children.
So we hear this every year that the state doesn't have the money to pay for children and
families facing hunger.
it just or to run humane state prisons where staff and inmates don't have their lives threatened
and taken in that setting. And we do a bit but with the commitment needs to be much greater
instead of blowing a hole in our state budget because $20 billion is what we gather in
sales tax.
A few seconds to respond.
You've heard Senator Orok tell you about all the things that government does poorly.
Why would we want to throw more money into a whole of things that we've done poorly?
We're incredibly inefficient programs.
Allow people to keep their own money.
They can afford their own power bill, their own gas bill, their own grocery bill.
I'm going to bet on them.
Okay.
Well, people all over the state turned out some public service commissioners that because
of high electricity costs, we're going to have to leave it like that.
I appreciate both of you being here.
There's so much more to talk about.
There is indeed Donna and we appreciate the opportunity.
Well, that does it for our today's show.
Tomorrow, Governor Brian Kemp gives his final state of the state address and will have
a special one-hour show that, with that address and the Democratic response, have a good evening.
