Good morning.
What a beautiful day out there this morning.
legislative day 33. We will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the
chaplain after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our
chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 169
House District representative or Rickia representative or Rickia thank you so
much mr. Speaker and as always thank you for allowing us this time for
scripture reading and devotional and I think everybody would agree right now
this is a much needed time good morning colleagues and it is truly an honor to
introduce my friend and pastor, Dr. Don had a way. I'm blessed to serve and
worship under his ministry and his leadership at First Baptist Church of
Douglas. And as I was prepared to introduce him, I literally had feelings of
being unworthy to even introduce the man that has the opportunity to share
with us God's word this morning. God has truly been at work in Brother Don's
life, all of his life. One of the stories that I love to tell is in the sixth grade in 1975 when I was
still in daycare. Brother Don's teacher gave them an assignment and question number five on that
assignment was what are your goals and are you going to accomplish them? And so the way he answered that
As a sixth grader was I want to finish high school and I want to become a preacher and he still has that assignment paper today.
It was October the 6th, 1975.
Another story that I enjoy was one of his dear friends as another guy, Pastor William Pope.
Pastor William shares a story that when they were in high school and a lot of young people were driving around the dairy queen and maybe not up to all good
all good that the brother Don and brother William would go to a park and get on their knees
and pray for God to do a work in that community.
And brother Don organized as a senior in high school at 16 years old, organized a youth
revival, subsequently leading several young people to faith in Jesus Christ.
Now, I certainly don't want to eat up his time with all of the good things that God has
done through his ministry, but I'm telling you he is a true man of God. You know
Brother Don's been married to Miss Sonja, his wife, for 25 years they have three
wonderful children, Daniel, that's 21, I'm sorry Nathan, that's 23, and Anna Lane
that's 19. He holds a Bachelor of Music Education from Bruton Parker. He has a
Master of Divinity and a Doctor of Ministry from New Orleans Baptist
theological seminary. Dr. Hadaway is a former president of the Georgia Baptist
Convention and some of you have probably met him through that. He has served in
ministry and pastor for over 30 years and thankfully God called him to come
back to First Baptist Church of Douglas and one of the things that I
recognized immediately that he stands firm on the teaching of the an errant
an infallible word of God and he is a true believer that God changes lives, that to change a man you've
got to change his heart and when you change his heart you change his family and when you change
his family you change the world for eternity. Pastor Don had a way.
Thank you so much Mr. Speaker, distinguished members of the House. I want you to know how much
I appreciate this opportunity I counted as a tremendous privilege and honor to be before you this morning.
Many people would define peace as the absence of conflict. However, life is filled with adversity
and hardships. Living in a world without conflict is impossible. Yet there is a peace that is
available that transcends times of difficulty and pain. This piece that does not
come in a bottle or peel, it does not come through being borrowed or bought. It
is not gained through anything that we can do on a personal level. It comes
through a relationship with God. After Jesus told his disciples about his impending crucifixion,
they were deeply troubled. He reassured then with a promise that is recorded in our scriptures,
John chapter 14 verse 27, peace I leave with you, my peace I give to you, not as the world gives
do I give to you? Do not let your heart be troubled nor let it be fearful. Like the disciples,
we also face troubles that can cause us to despair. The good news is that the peace Jesus promised
to His disciples is also available to us. The question is how can we experience this peace?
Before we can have peace from God, we must first of all have peace with God.
Romans chapter 5 verse 1 tells us how,
For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of his son, much more
had it been reconciled we shall be saved by his life.
we do not see ourselves as the enemies of God. But sin is rebellion against him.
We find in the scriptures of Romans chapter 3 verse 23 for all have sinned and fallen short of
God's glory. God is holy and we are sinful in that we've violated His commands. Just look at the
world, the hatred, the injustice. It seems to be everywhere in growing. These are
but symptoms of a deeper problem. The problem is sin in the human heart and
we have been infected by it. All of us. While in our sin God reached out to us in
love. He sent his son, the Lord Jesus, to pay the penalty for our sins and to
forgive us and then to reconcile us to Himself. Christ has made peace with God
possible and of course that's what John 316 tells us for God so loved the
world that He gave His only begotten Son that whoever believes in Him
shall not perish but have everlasting life. We can have peace with God by
acknowledging our sin and believing in Christ when we yield our lives to Christ
sin no longer separates us from God, and we have peace with Him. After we make peace with God,
we can have the peace from God. This means that when we encounter life's problems,
we have the power and presence of God that gives us calm assurance that all is well.
One of the verses in the hymn, it is well with my soul, beautifully reminds us of God's
perfect peace.
When peace like a river, attendeth my way, when sorrows like seed billows roll, whatever
my lot thou hast taught me to say, it is well, it is well with my soul.
of God's peace. Today we too can say it is well, it is well with my soul. Would you please
pray with me. Heavenly Father, we desperately need peace in this broken world. Our sins
have separated us from you and from each other. Thank you for sending your Son to pay our
our sin debt so that we could be forgiven and reconciled to you, and so that we can be
at peace with you and others. I pray that each person here today will find your peace.
Also that we will be peace makers with those around us. In Jesus' name I pray, amen. Would
Do you join me in the pledge?
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America,
and to the republic for which it stands,
one nation under God, and indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all.
Doorkypers will unlock the doors.

Audits.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Your Committee on Information and Audits read the previous proceeding and previous legislative
and found them be correct. There's a saying, well done, it's better than well said.
And Representative Tray Rose did not say that, but it's Benjamin Franklin.
I'll tell you, I'm enjoying and learning from the report every morning.

But ask members to take a moment and look at the board and make sure that it is accurate.
The clerk will lock the machines on the gentleman's motion that this house reconsider its
action in giving House Bill 1029, the requisite constitutional majority, the
eyes are 63, the nays are 95, the motion is lost, and this house has failed to
reconsider its action. On Wednesday, June 17, the House passed House Bill 1030,
The gentleman from the 132nd District, the minority leader of the House, served notice
of a motion to reconsider the action of the House in giving House Bill 1030 the requisite
majority.
Now is the time for the gentleman to pursue the motion if he so desires.
The chair recognizes leader Trammell own his motion.
Mr. Speaker, would ask unanimous consent to withdraw a motion with respect to House Bill
1030.
The minority leader has asked for unanimous consent to withdraw his motion for reconsideration
on House Bill 1030.
Is there objection, Chair, here's none, and it is so ordered and is withdrawn.
We will now go home to morning orders.
orders. What purpose does
representative Williams rise?
Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not true
as a speaker that has a point of
personal courtesy? I usually vote
on reconsiderations. I believe that to be true. Is it not further true that Senator David Lucas
sponsored this bill, Macon and had the bill come up, I would have voted yes, I have a great
respect for him and his local leadership. I believe the gentleman is truthful about that which he
states. Morning orders are a total of 10 minutes for all of the morning orders. The chair recognizes
Representative Bonner for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This morning I rise to recognize
a special group of Georgians. The motto for this group is always ready, always there. Since early
March, the men and women of the Georgia Army Guard, Air Guard, and State Defense Force have
been activated and mobilized throughout the state to fight against COVID-19.
And let me share with you just a few things that these incredible individuals have been
doing for us.
During the course of that time since early March, they have conducted 50,000 COVID-19 tests.
They have disinfected 720 state nursing homes.
Some as many as six times, all at no cost to those homes.
They have packaged and delivered 948,000 meals for the Atlanta Public Schools System and
delivered those meals.
They've worked at a total of 10 food banks, packaging 65.2 million pounds of food, and
prepping 34.3 million meals.
In addition, they've augmented our state hospitals.
They have assisted our various agencies.
In fact, there are 3,100 guards been currently mobilized
throughout the state of Georgia doing exactly
what they've been called to do.
Always ready, always there.
These men and women are serving,
regardless of race, creed, and color.
They swore a note to the Constitution, the State of Georgia,
and to the Constitution of the United States.
And they are doing so and providing a great example
to each and every one of us.
In addition to what they've done for COVID-19,
1,600 personnel have responded to the civil unrest.
With the National Guardsmen on site at Linux Mall,
within 15 minutes of Governor Kemp signing
an executive order authorizing them to do so.
These are our constituents.
These are our neighbors.
These are our friends.
These are Georgians that have set everything aside
to not only defend us, but to do so without prejudice.
And so today, Mr. Speaker,
I'd like to offer a sincere thanks
to Major General Tom Cardin,
Command Sergeant Major Marsher,
and the entire command staff
and all the men and women of the Georgia Department
defense for all they've done for us over the last few months.
We thank you and God bless and wish you Godspeed.
Thank you, Ms. Stringer.
Applause
Chair recognizes representative Kendrick
for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
These are unprecedented times.
These are times that have left us confused and scared in part
because we simply don't know when it will all end.
While all this is no doubt at least in part true for all of us, the burden of it has fallen
disproportionately upon our black friends and colleagues.
This is not okay.
Meanwhile many of us have for the most part state silent.
This is not okay either.
So what now?
What do we do now that issues always present but seemingly bundling below the surface
there squarely in the face?
What we do is rise.
issues have risen, so we rise to meet them. But we don't rise alone. See in my eyes we are a family,
a family of 52,000. These are not my words, but the words, the departing words of Attorney
Darrylson, the outgoing president of the State Bar of Georgia, at last week's meeting.
And I am proud to be one of those 52 members of the State Bar of Georgia. Thank you, Mrs. Speaker.
Chair recognizes representative Abel Mabel Thomas who promised to get on
early today but we ran out of time on her yesterday.
Okay, thank you Mr. Speaker and members of distinguished bodies.
This is a time in history that we really can't just step past.
So I want to start off saying to the protestors for them to be safe,
be nonviolent and continue to be persistent,
march on to the playing columns.
Otherwise, we will go back to normal.
According to Reverend William Barber,
who found him on Monday,
there are 140 million folks in poverty,
but that's why Brown et cetera.
What he states is he wants to build
a multiracial democracy fight against systemic racism
in poverty.
He states that there's a cost for inequality.
So on Saturday, this Saturday, the 20th,
he's coordinated summit on poverty
and is a virtual conference due to the pandemic.
It was supposed to be like a march on Washington.
So he states that this is just not about police brutality
and misconduct.
This is about structural racism and white privilege.
I'd like to also commend Tamika Mallory for her voice
in this matter of revolution and for raising
and elevating the name of Brianna Taylor
in the climate of injustice.
Rachel Brooke's sleep in the drive through ends up dead.
The guy in South Carolina killed nine people
in an enemy church pretending he wanted to pray.
He gets a chance to go to Burger King,
taken by the police, the price of a hamburger.
I'm here to tell you that going back to Reverend Barber, he said we can't deal with poverty
alone.
It's always the interlocking, interjustice of systematic racism, ecological devastation,
the war economy, and the distorted moral narrative of religious and naturalism.
Our basic demand is the reconstruction of local state and federal policies to address
these interlocking injustices.
This is a time in history, we cannot step past it.
This is an opportunity for us to all be in this together, not by being kinder to each
other and speaking to each other, which is a start, but for us to begin to really look
at the structure and the foundation for which our democracy has been based upon.
It is time for systematic change to make sure that people of color or respect it, people
So we'll call it have the type of rights as everybody else and it's just not about police
brutality.
It is much deeper.
Thank you very much.
Mr. Speaker, an idea of a will.
Chair recognizes Chairman Allen Powell for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen.
Williams. I made an announcement about multiple members in the well on Monday and I have to be
consistent with that. We'll let you sit up here on the front row. I know you have a great interest in this.
Gentlemen may proceed. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House.
You know, I'd like to ask everybody to stand in honor of one of our own, the man who
couldn't stand for the last 22 years, Rusty Kid.
A lot of y'all that had the great pleasure of knowing Rusty and serving with him, from
O9 to 17, Rusty was a unique character, and I say character because he came from a line
of characters.
His daddy was the famous Culver Kid, the great fox of the Senate.
Rusty learned this, he learned politics in the early life.
While his daddy was a 50-year veteran of the legislature, Rusty was a lobbyist in our
earlier life, and a businessman for their business in Millageville.
Unfortunately, around 98, Rusty was injured at a motorcycle accident, quite, quite humbly
to see a man of his physique, a man who played football at Tennessee, a man of his
who was active, but, you know, that motorcycle put him in a wheelchair.
And I remember going to Shepard to see him.
There was no way that he should have ever been able to survive.
But nothing more than sheer willpower of being his character.
He survived. He learned to breathe again.
He learned to motivate that wheelchair that we all knew of Rusty.
Rusty kid had character ladies and gentlemen.
ran as an independent. He was like a lot of us. He didn't like either political parties because neither parties always right
neither parties always wrong. But he stood for that principle of representing his constituency in Millageville, Georgia.
So I'm not going to yield a jazzy because everybody knew that New Rusty knew what a guy was and what a big heart he had.
what a big heart he had he gave more to people that needed things that
couldn't afford it because of what he had because of the life that he was
able to lead he lived because he had the opportunity to survive for another
22 years. Rusty died on June the 2nd. I'm gonna tell you something when the
clouds peeled back for us to come up there to be with a lot of the old
timers include and call them. It had to be a shaken and bacon session in heaven.
Ladies and gentlemen, pay honor to the famous Rustic yet.
Thank you very much, Representative Powell.
We have used up our 10 minutes for today, the members wish to be heard tomorrow can sign
back up. We're going on now to the rules calendar. Going to the rules calendar, the clerk
will read the caption to Senate Bill 372.
Senate Bill 372 by Senator Tillery, the 19th,
Berkeley 11th, Miller, the 49th, Watson, the 1st, and others,
be taught on act to amend various titles,
the official code of Georgia annotated,
so as to modernize, clarify, and update provisions
relating to public health.
I refer to the committee on health and human services that committee recommends that this bill do pass
Chair recognizes the chair of the House health and human services committee chairman Cooper to present the bill
Thank you mr. Speaker ladies and gentlemen of the House I bring to you Senate bill 372 this is a public health
clean up bill to reduce unnecessary or duplicate administrative burdens and to
update the Georgia Code to match what DPH is actually doing. For example, there
has never been a kidney disease advisory committee appointed in 20-something
year so this bill does away with that advisory committee. It does do two major
things that I will point out to you. It updates the rules on the lock
which is the antidote for drug overdoses is it makes it possible for our first
of our first responders to be able to get an eloxone from the manufacturers at
a much less cost. It also there and there's some of you may have had questions
over people who like to do hereditary checks in genealogy. We have many
Many Georgians living beyond 100 years of age used to, at 100 years, the records went
and were put over in the archives, making them available to anybody that wanted to go
through.
That would be their birth certificate, death certificate and all.
And so, in abundance of caution, because we have people living beyond 100, they will
no longer send those records to the archives until 25 years have passed to, it's 125.
people will be able to get the records of deceased individuals by contacting the department and
there will be a fee unfortunately to go with that but they're protecting our elderly citizens.
Mr. Speaker that is the end and I would ask your favourable vote if there's no questions I will yield
the well. You may have a question you do have a question. I will take one.
Ladies, we'll take one question.
The chair recognizes representative Stovall in room 341.
Okay.
Does the lady yield?
Yes, I will.
Does this bill have anything to do with a merger being created
for the new public health district with Clayton County and eight of the counties.
No, ma'am, it does not.
You do not appear to have any more questions.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the will and ask the members for their positive vote.
Thank you.
We have a member that wishes to speak on the bill.
chair recognizes representative Vernon Jones to speak on the bill thank you
mr. Speaker members of the Georgia House I didn't get a chance to ask the
general lady a question I didn't have enough time to get up to the gallery but
what I wanted to say if I'm not mistaken this bill deals with vital records and
I'm fine with that but you have a lot of people young people and others who
like to do family trees. And as a part of that you have to seek a lot of records
that's important, death certificates and other types of documents. In this
particular piece of legislation let's I'm incorrect. Those fees are going to be
charged by third party. So if I'm a student and I'm in college and I want to
do some research. To get a death certificate that's over a hundred years old is
going to cost about a hundred dollars. Who's setting that fee? That could be
real expensive to each and every one of us who needs to go out and do their
family tree. That's just simple. Who's going to set those fees? And if a private
company set those fees, it can go up anytime they want to increase those fees.
So I'm all about paying for services.
So if I'm incorrect, just I just want to make sure that it is correct.
And I'm sorry to generate.
I didn't give a chance to answer your I'm getting chance to ask you a question.
Let's speak out.
You have any questions at this time.
You have a question from Chairman Cooper.
Do you're right?
Thank you for the gentleman.
Yes, ma'am, I do.
Okay. Thank you for saying that you did not hear it. The fee will be $25 and I guess I can't. And who says to fee?
It would be the people in the vital records public health department.
Which is not right. You all have this way. You can go back and ask her when you leave the well.
I'll go. I'll come back and ask. That's not prohibited. Yeah. You have another question though. If you yield.
I yield Mr. Speaker chair recognizes representative Bentley to your left for a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker
There's a gentleman you I do isn't not true that
Being a part of the funeral industry I deal with death certificates on a regular base
Yes, ma'am and people are dying to get to you. Yes, ma'am. You're right. Thank you for noting that is enough
Her the true that is correct to what chair lady
Cooper stated death certificates are twenty five dollars and five dollars for each additional
certificate requested by any individual if that's to what if that was the if
that is what the latest states then I I appreciate her answer yes sir thank you
very much thank you miss speaker okay is there any objection to the previous
question being ordered the chair here's none the previous question is ordered
is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was
favorable to the passage of the bill. The chair here is done. The report of the committee
is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of Senate Bill?
372 will vote yes. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines and call the
room.

members will check the board and make sure that it is accurate Mr. Clerk we
lock the machines on the passage of Senate Bill 372 the eyes are 157 the
and these are two.
This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority
is therefore passed yesterday.
Senate bill 295 was postponed until the next legislative day.
It is called at this time, the clerk will read the caption
to Senate bill 295.
Senate Bill 295 by Senator Wilkinson, the 50th Gooch, the 51st walker, the 20th mullets, the 53rd
and others to be titled an act to amend titles 15 and 48 to the fiscal to George Anitator
Relay and courts and revenue and taxation respectively, so as revised the cost of living
in general performance based increases to take an account the increases provider for in
2020 this bill ever referred to committee on government affairs that committee recommends
that this bill do pass by committee substitute.
Chair recognizes representative Earhart to present the bill.
Thank you Mr. Speaker and members of the assembly.
I present to you Senate Bill 295 for your consideration.
This bill is essentially a cleanup bill for a bill we passed last session, Senate Bill
171, that granted our constitutional officers in the state of Georgia, the first substantial
pay raise they've received in more than 15 years.
Our probate judges, clerk, court tax commissioners and sheriffs all received newly established
and competitive base salaries for the first time since 2005.
What does SB 295 do?
It does three things.
It protects the 2020 state cost of living, 2% increase that was granted to our Georgia
Constitutional Officers this year.
At the time of the original writing of SB 171, that particular COLA was not foreseen
could not have been anticipated, was not an effect yet.
So SB 295 basically tightens up that language to protect that 2020 cost of living that
was granted to them, keeps it intact, without this change to the current law.
would lose that 2020 cost of living that was granted this year.
The second thing that does is it adds language to sort of tighten it up to ensure that there
is no possibility of double dipping with pay raises for 2020.
While the 2020 2% COLA, what were made in effect, specific language has been added to
ensure that no previous COLA's, previous compensations can be added to the newly established salary
structure.
So kind of protecting that from double dipping.
There was a committee substitute also to include the word state prior to the phrase cost
of living allowance to clarify that this bill refers only to the state cost of living
allowances has no bearing or effect on any sort of local supplements that the counties
may put in place.
Towards noting the bill, which is the result of collaboration between COAG and ACCG, just a simple housekeeping bill, I ask for your favourable consideration.
Mr. Speaker, if there are no questions, I will yield the well.
You do not appear to have any questions.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
The chair here is none.
The previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute?
The chair here is none.
The committee substitute is adopted.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable
to the passage of the bill?
The chair here is none.
The report of the committee is agreed to.
Shall this bill now pass?
All those in favor of the passage of Senate Bill 295 will vote aye.
Those opposed to vote no in the clerk will unlock the machines and call the roll.

and be sure that it is correct.
Mr. Clerk, you may lock the machines
on the passage of Senate Bill 295.
The eyes are 159, the knees are zero.
This bill having received the requisite constitutional
majority is therefore passed.
You
We'll read the caption to Senate Bill 377.
7 Bill 370, Senator Jones, the 25th, Berkeley, 11th, Mulles, the 53rd Robinson, the 29th
Cropatch, the 32nd, and others to be titled an act to amend Code Section 8202, the official
go to George annotated, relating to inspections, so as to reduce the number of required annual
Elevator inspections this bill have referred to the committee on insurance that committee recommends this bill do pass
by committee substitute
Chair recognizes chairman Lomston to present the bill
Madam Speaker members of the House I bring to you Senate bill 377 the bill that comes as a request from the state insurance
Commissioners and the builders association
The bill has three basic parts.
First, the insurance commissioner is by law responsible for a variety of functions related
to buildings, record keepings, printing, mounting of license, testing and inspections.
The inspections and licensing of elevators, escalators, moving walkways and similar people
moving devices is one such process handled through the insurance commissioner's office.
Currently, Georgia law calls for all of these devices to be inspected every six months.
This requirement dates back many decades because of advances in technology, most of the
older type elevators no longer exist.
Most other states have a 12 or 18-month inspection cycle.
The reality is that only about 35% of the existing devices can be inspected within the existing
six-month timeframe with our existing certified inspectors.
So by changing the requirement to 12 months, it would allow the department to better focus
its resources in areas that are already identified as needing more frequent inspections
or accommodate those who want their devices inspected more frequently.
Since most elevator devices are maintained and serviced by commercial companies under
contract, an inspection schedule in line with other states seems reasonable and poses
no increased safety concerns.
Senate Bill 377 changes the time frame for inspections from six months to 12 months.
Secondly, it also changes shall in line 39 to May.
In many areas, the Department of Insurance
uses third-party vendors to provide various services
such as record keeping, licensing, testing, printing,
and so forth.
So by changing shall to May, it enables
the department to renegotiate contracts
and change the current process to a more traditional approach
that should provide savings to taxpayers
and transparency in the process.
Thirdly, the other part of this bill
puts into code an executive order issued by the governor during the pandemic, which allows
local governments to use private plan review and inspections for all building types including
hospitals, ambulatory health care centers, nursing homes, jails, airports and high rises.
Third party plan review and inspection is already a common practice, but not for all building
types.
During the pandemic many local government services were impacted because key personnel
were prevented from performing their jobs and in the case of a construction projects without
plan review and inspection, construction would come to a halt.
This simply permits a process that is already in place to be used in the construction of
some previously excluded building types.
So in short, the bill does three things.
It changes the inspection frequency for elevators from six months to twelve months.
It changes chow to may and it codifies an executive order that expands the type of structures
that private plan review and inspection may be used for.
Madam Speaker, that is the bill.
I'll be glad to answer any questions.
It does not appear to be any questions on the chamber floor.
Up there is a question.
Is there a question from the gallery?
Is it the bedenna view?
I do.
I just have a question about the inspection period.
We are reducing the number of inspections of elevators
that we're doing.
Currently, the law states six months
as the inspection process.
But as I noted in my comments, this date back many decades
and was primarily geared at those types of elevators
that existed at the time the law was put in.
Since then there have been many advances in the way
and the elevator design and technology surrounding that.
So it simply recognizes the situation
that things have improved and it provides the department,
the ability to focus its attention on those areas
where they know problems already exist
and can better utilize the limited resources
that they have to make sure that the safety is in place.
that's a generally further yield. I do. Have you ever been stuck in an elevator? I have not.
Okay well I have and it's very scary and if that happens when inspections are
happening happening every six months, I'm just fearful of what might happen if
these spread those inspections out in being part of. The reality is only about
About 35% of the elevators in the state are being inspected every six months because the
insurance department does not have adequate personnel inspectors to carry out that every
six months.
In fact, if we were to be able to carry that out every six months, we would have to add
20 new inspectors to make that happen.
But what we have is a situation where the newer style elevators, technology, it would
make much sense to inspect a brand new elevator every six months since they seldom present
problems early on. It's usually much longer in their life before they start having problems.
Thank you.
Yes. There are a couple more questions if you care to yield. The chair recognizes Chairman
Knight for a question. I'll take one more.
There's a gentleman yield. How are you?
I really appreciate you bringing this bill, and I want to, again, go back to seeing the
comments, and isn't it true that many other states have already enacted their laws state
that it's 12 months or 18 months of inspection?
That has already changed their laws to reflect on the newer technology and the newer
That is great.
For the words and the truth, as you've alluded to, this will allow the department to focus
its resources, as you've said, on the older elevators and focus with the commerce officer
of the regional lady, whenever I have that experience again.
I agree fully.
Thank you.
Madam Speaker, I yield the well.
The gentleman has yielded the well for what purpose does representative Lopez Romero rise?
Stature inquiry
Unfortunately, the office kept away, but I would want to know if our elevators will now be inspected on the yearly basis as well.
By hours I'm here.
The chairman doesn't know the answer, but certainly can ask the author of the bill that's carrying it here.
There are no more questions.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
The chair here is not in the previous question as ordered.
Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute?
The chair here is not in the committee substitute as adopted.
Is there an objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill?
Chair here is not in the report of the committee as agreed to.
Shall this bill now pass?
All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes.
All those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machine and call the roll.

as to how to vote.
If it does and all members have voted, the clerk will lock the machine.
On the passage of the bill, the a's were 134, the a's were 27, the bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is there for a path.
Clerk will read the caption to Senate bill 144, Senate bill 144.

Chair recognizes chairman Fleming to present the bill
Thank you, madam speaker ladies and gentlemen of the house Senate bill 144 is a bill that passed with the unanimous bipartisan
Consent out of the Senate and support it deals with the sale of
of tobacco products at a special event.
You are probably, for me, with going to a festival
of some sort and someone will be a local vendor
with already a license and they'll set up a tent
and sell alcoholic beverages at that event.
There is a process for that.
There is not a similar process for us
to allow the sale of tobacco products at a special event.
This would allow a person that is one of your local
businessmen who has a tobacco shop, for example,
to get a special permit to sell.
a festival or an outdoor event or something of that type. All the same
restrictions that have to apply to the cell of tobacco anywhere will be an
application here. If there are any violations of those that person stands to
have their license revoked. Madam Speaker, that is simply it. I would be
happy to answer any questions from members of the house.
The Chair does not observe any questions.
Thank you, Madam Speaker.
I yield the well and ask for your favor.
The gentleman has yielded the well.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
