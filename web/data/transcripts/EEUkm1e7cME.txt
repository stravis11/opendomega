TRANSCRIPT
----------
>> THIS IS A BILL THAT MAKES
REASONABLE REVISIONS TO OUR
CIVIL PRACTICE ACT AND
REASONABLE AS WELL AS
REASONABLE REVISIONS TO BUILD
THIRD PARTY NEGLIGENT SECURITY
LIABILITY. AND, MR. SPEAKER,
THAT'S THE BILL.
>> PLEASE DON'T GO A DOPE. IT
AIN'T ABOUT PREMIUMS. DON'T BE
THERE, FOLK. LOOK AT IT. THE
ONLY INSURANCE MOST PEOPLE WHO
ARE HARD WORKING GEORGIANS HAVE
IS A HOMEOWNER'S POLICY. A CAR
POLICY, AND HEALTH POLICY.
THAT'S IT. THIS IS NOT FOR HARD
WORKING GEORGIANS. THIS IS FOR
GOOD LIVING GEORGIANS WHO WANT
TO LIVE BETTER.
HOUSE. THE TORT REFORM
IS FIERCELY DEBATED BY. BY A
SLIM MARGIN. IT'S THE CLOSEST
VOTE IN THE HOUSE THIS.
MORE ON TORT REFORM. COMING UP.
GEORGIA IS A PRIME DESTINATION
FOR CONVENTIONS. IT HAS A BUSY
INTERSTATE SYSTEM FOR
TRANSPORTING GOODS BY TRUCKS,
AND IT'S HOME TO THE WORLD'S
BUSIEST AIRPORT. BUT THESE SAME
HIGHLIGHTS CONTRIBUTE TO MAKING
GEORGIA A HOTSPOT FOR HUMAN
TRAFFICKING. TONIGHT, I SIT DOWN
WITH GEORGIA'S FIRST LADY,
MARTY KEMP, TO TALK ABOUT HER
ANTI-TRAFFICKING FIGHT AND THE
RESULTS. SHE CONTINUES TO
PRODUCE. IT'S A BIPARTISAN
BATTLE, AND TWO LAWMAKERS JOIN
THE SHOW WHO SHARE HER PASSION
FOR MEANINGFUL CHANGE. FIRST
CORRESPONDENT SARAH KALLIS HAS
TODAY'S CAPITOL REPORT.
>> HI, DONNA. TODAY WAS BUCKY'S
DAY AT THE CAPITOL, AND THE
HOUSE DEBATED TORT REFORM. THE
DAY STARTED WITH A FINAL PUSH
AGAINST SB 68. THE ROBUST
LAWSUIT REFORM BILL THAT WOULD
LIMIT GEORGIA'S ABILITY TO SUE
BUSINESSES FOR CRIMES THAT OCCUR
ON THEIR PROPERTY, STOPS
ATTORNEYS FROM RECOVERING FEES
TWICE FOR THE SAME CASE, AND
ALLOWS SEPARATE TRIALS FOR
ASSIGNING RESPONSIBILITIES AND
DAMAGES.
>> RIGHT NOW, GEORGIA LAW
PROTECTS INNOCENT VICTIMS LIKE
ME. VICTIMS WHO HAVE A
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO A JURY
TRIAL. RIGHT NOW, GEORGIA LAW
HOLDS OWNERS AND MANAGERS OF
PROPERTIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE
CRIMES THAT THEY TURNED A BLIND
EYE TO. THIS GIVES THESE
APARTMENTS MOTIVATION TO KEEP
THE APARTMENTS SAFE. SB 68 WAS
WRITTEN BY INSURANCE LOBBYISTS
AND STRIP VICTIMS LIKE ME OF
THEIR RIGHTS.
>> THE HOUSE THEN TOOK UP THE
BILL, ONE OF THE MOST DEBATED
PIECES OF LEGISLATION THIS
SESSION. THE TORT REFORM BILL
WAS NAMED AS GOVERNOR KEMP TOP
LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY.
>> THIS IS A BILL THAT MAKES
REASONABLE REVISIONS TO OUR
CIVIL PRACTICE ACT AND
REASONABLE REVISIONS TO OUR
EVIDENTIARY CODE, AS WELL AS
REASONABLE REVISIONS TO OUR
LIABILITY, THIRD PARTY
NEGLIGENCE, SECURITY, LIABILITY.
AND, MR. SPEAKER, THAT'S THE
BILL.
>> OPPONENTS OF THE BILL WERE
QUICK TO SAY IT DOES NOT
GUARANTEE LOWER INSURANCE RATES.
>> THE PROPONENTS OF THIS BILL
HAVE SPENT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
PREYING ON OUR STRESS AND
FRUSTRATION, TELLING US THAT
THIS BILL WILL REDUCE OUR RATES,
STABILIZE OUR RATES, KEEP
PROVIDERS FROM LEAVING THE
STATE. IT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE.
>> BUT SUPPORTERS SAY IT STRIKES
A BALANCE BETWEEN INSURANCE
COMPANIES AND CITIZENS.
>> THIS PROTECTS BUSINESSES FROM
UNJUST LAWSUITS WHILE
MAINTAINING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR
GENUINE NEGLIGENCE.
>> MOST DEMOCRATS SAID IT ONLY
MAKES IT HARDER FOR VICTIMS TO
RECEIVE JUSTICE.
>> THIS BILL HURTS THE
92-YEAR-OLD ELDERLY WOMAN WHO
DIED IN HER BED BECAUSE SHE WAS
DEVOURED BY FIRE ANTS. THIS BILL
HURTS THE FOUR YEAR OLD BABY WHO
WENT IN FOR A RANDOM
TONSILLECTOMY. HIS WOUND WASN'T
SUTURED PROPERLY, AND BY THE
TIME HE GOT TO THE DRIVEWAY OF
HIS HOME, HE BLED TO DEATH IN
FRONT OF HIS MOTHER AND HIS
BROTHER AND HIS SISTER. THESE
ARE THE PEOPLE, THE BACKS UPON
WHOM THIS BILL.
>> BUT REPUBLICANS PUSHED BACK.
>> THERE'S NOT ONE LINE IN THIS
BILL. NOWHERE THAT DOES NOT
ALLOW A RAPE VICTIM TO BRING A
CLAIM. NOT ONE. NOT ONE LINE IN
THIS BILL DOES THAT. NOWHERE. IT
IS DISINGENUOUS TO SAY SO.
>> THE BILL PASSED 91-82 JUST
BARELY REACHING THE VOTES
REQUIRED FOR PASSAGE. A HANDFUL
OF REPRESENTATIVES VOTED ACROSS
PARTY LINES. SB 68 WAS
IMMEDIATELY TRANSMITTED BACK TO
THE SENATE FOR FINAL APPROVAL OF
THE HOUSE. CHANGES, WHICH
INCLUDED EXCEPTIONS FOR SEX
TRAFFICKING VICTIMS. SPEAKER OF
THE HOUSE JON BURNS PRAISED THE
PASSAGE OF THE BILL AND SAID THE
HOUSE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO
CURB INSURANCE COSTS.
>> THAT'S THE REASON WE ARE
CREATING A HOUSE STUDY COMMITTEE
ON INSURANCE MARKET REFORM. WE
ALL KNOW THAT INSURANCE COVERAGE
IS VITAL FOR THE SUCCESS OF
WELL-BEING AND THE WELL-BEING OF
INDIVIDUALS, INDIVIDUALS, AND
BUSINESSES. AND FOR TOO LONG,
INSURANCE PREMIUMS HAVE BEEN
INCREASING AT AN ALARMING RATE.
>> THE SENATE TOOK UP TWO HOUSE
BILLS DEALING WITH STATE TAXES.
HB 111 WILL REDUCE THE STATE TAX
RATE FROM THE CURRENT 5.3 9-5
0.19%, WITH AN ADDITIONAL 0.1
PERCENTAGE EVERY YEAR UNTIL IT
REACHES 4.99.
>> WHILE OTHER STATES ARE
RAISING TAXES ON THEIR CITIZENS
AT A TIME WHEN THEY'RE FACING
SKY HIGH PRICES AND CAN LEAST
AFFORD IT. WE ARE DOING THE
OPPOSITE HERE IN GEORGIA. WE'RE
PUTTING MONEY BACK IN THE HANDS
OF GEORGIANS, WHICH THIS BILL,
HB 111, DOES.
>> DEMOCRATS SAY THAT THIS TAX
REDUCTION BILL JUST BENEFITS THE
RICH.
>> THIS LEGISLATION WILL COST
748 MILLION. ONLY 33% OF IT WILL
GO TO 80% OF GEORGIANS. 67% OF
IT WILL GO TO THE TOP 20%.
AGAIN, ANOTHER WAY OF PUTTING
IT, BUT IT'S A TAX CUT FOR THE
RICH.
>> HB 112 WILL PROVIDE FROM $250
TO $500 REBATES. IF YOU FILE
STATE TAXES DURING 2024 AND
2025. BOTH BILLS WERE PASSED. HB
423 WOULD MOVE THE EXISTING
STATE 911 SYSTEM TO A MORE
MODERN INTERNET PROTOCOL, OR IP
SYSTEM, ALLOWING DIFFERENT
ELECTRONIC DEVICES AND SYSTEMS
TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER.
>> MOVING THIS TO THE NEXT
GENERATION, AS MOST OTHER STATES
HAVE ALREADY DONE, WILL ALLOW US
TO SIGNIFICANTLY UPGRADE THE
AVAILABILITY OF 911 OPERATIONS.
THE ABILITY IN ORDER TO HAVE
BUSINESS CONTINUITY BETWEEN
MULTIPLE 911 CENTERS AND REALLY
BRING US INTO THE 21st CENTURY.
>> THE NEW SYSTEM SHOULD BE
BETTER EQUIPPED TO HANDLE MORE
CALLERS WITHOUT ANY WAIT TIME
FOR ESSENTIAL SERVICES. AND IF
YOUR HORSE HATES FIREWORKS, YOU
ARE NOT ALONE. HB 614 WOULD
ALLOW MUNICIPALITIES AND
COUNTIES TO OUTLAW FIREWORKS
WITHIN 200 YARDS OF STABLES OR
OTHER EQUINE FACILITIES.
>> THE LOUD, SUDDEN NOISE NEAR
HORSE FARMS ARE DANGEROUS TO THE
PEOPLE THAT OWN AND RIDE HORSES,
AND TO THE HORSES THEMSELVES.
THERE'S ALSO A FIRE THREAT FROM
FIREWORKS. SINCE MANY HORSES ARE
HOUSED IN WOODEN BARNS WITH
BALES OF HAY.
>> THE BILL WAS OVERWHELMINGLY
PASSED, BUT DID RECEIVE ONE NAY.
TOMORROW, THE SENATE IS EXPECTED
TO CONSIDER THE HOUSE'S
AMENDMENTS TO SENATE BILL 68.
THAT'S ALL FROM MY CAPITOL
REPORT, DONNA.
>> THANKS, SARAH. WHEN MARTY
KEMP BECAME GEORGIA'S FIRST LADY
IN 2019, SHE KNEW WHERE SHE
WANTED TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN
THE STATE. WHEN I SPOKE TO HER
RECENTLY, THE MOTHER OF THREE
GIRLS TOLD ME THAT HER INTEREST
IN FIGHTING HUMAN TRAFFICKING
BEGAN BEFORE HER HUSBAND WAS
ELECTED GOVERNOR.
>> WE WENT TO THE ATLANTIC
STATION, WHERE THEY WERE HAVING
A, YOU KNOW, A PRESS CONFERENCE
PRETTY MUCH JUST TALKING ABOUT
HUMAN TRAFFICKING. THEY HAD 72
SCHOOL BUSSES, WHICH REPRESENTED
THE 3,600 KIDS THAT WERE TAKEN
INTO TRAFFICKING A YEAR EVERY
YEAR IN GEORGIA. AND I WAS LIKE,
THAT CANNOT HAPPEN. THAT THAT
CAN'T BE. YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN
TRAVELING, CAMPAIGNING AROUND
THE STATE FOR TWO AND A HALF
YEARS, AND I'VE NEVER HEARD
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS. I STARTED
LEARNING MORE ABOUT IT. THE TEAM
BROUGHT IT TO ME. WE FORMED THE
GRACE COMMISSION, WHICH BROUGHT
ALL THE EXPERTS TO THE TABLE.
LAW ENFORCEMENT, NONPROFIT,
BUSINESSES, CORPORATIONS, AND
JUST REALLY TALKED ABOUT IT
LIKE, WHAT IS WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT IS EVERYBODY DOING? WHAT DO
WE NEED TO DO? AND IT NEEDED TO
HAVE MORE EDUCATION AND
AWARENESS, AND WE NEEDED TO HAVE
HARSHER PENALTIES. AND WE HAVE
DONE THAT.
>> EXPLAIN THE WHAT THE ACRONYM
GRACE IS.
>> SO IT'S GEORGIANS FOR REFUGE,
ACTION, COMPASSION AND
EDUCATION. SO WE HAVE NOW
GRACE'S PLACE, WHICH IS A
FACILITY THAT INTAKE WHERE WE
HAVE SURVIVORS COME AND GET THE
WRAPAROUND SERVICES THAT THEY
NEED. SO THAT'S BEEN AN
OPERATION FOR A YEAR. AND I
PRETTY MUCH WANT THAT. WOULD
LOVE TO HAVE THAT FACILITY BE A
MODEL FOR THE COUNTRY BECAUSE IT
HAS EVERYTHING THAT THEY NEED.
AND SO THAT THAT WOULD BE VERY
HELPFUL FOR OTHER STATES TO TAKE
THAT ON. SO WE'RE HOPEFULLY
GOING TO BUILD OUR THIRD
FACILITY BEFORE HE GETS OUT OF
OFFICE, WHICH I'D LIKE TO SEE,
YOU KNOW, FIVE OR SIX.
UNFORTUNATELY THEY'RE NEEDED.
BUT IT'S ALSO GETTING THE
SURVIVORS THE HELP THAT THEY
NEED THAT THEY DESERVE.
>> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT
SURPRISED ME WAS HOW PERVASIVE
THIS IS. WE TEND TO THINK THAT
IT IS A METRO ATLANTA PROBLEM,
RIGHT? BUT IT'S NOT.
>> RIGHT. IT IS NOT. AND I
REMEMBER I THINK THE STATISTIC
THEY GAVE ME BACK IN, MAYBE WE
TALKED ABOUT IT IN 21 WAS, YOU
KNOW, IT WAS IN 140 OR 147 OF
159 COUNTIES. AND I SAID FROM
THE BEGINNING, IT'S IN 159
COUNTIES. WE JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW TO RECOGNIZE IT. SO WE HAVE
ALSO TAUGHT LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE
HAVE A TRAINING THAT'S JUST 30
MINUTES. IT'S ON THE WEBSITE OF
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE UNDER THE
FIRST LADY GRACE COMMISSION. AND
IT JUST SHOWS YOU THE THINGS TO
LOOK FOR AND WHAT TO RECOGNIZE.
IT'S 30 MINUTES IN YOUR
EVERYDAY LIFE. IF YOU'RE OUT
SHOPPING, GOING TO THE AIRPORT,
TRAVELING, WHATEVER IT IS, IF
YOU SEE SOMETHING, SAY
SOMETHING. IF YOU'RE WRONG,
THAT'S OKAY. YOU CALL LAW
ENFORCEMENT AND YOU'RE YOU'RE
WRONG. THAT'S FINE. BUT WHAT IF
YOU SAVE SOMEBODY'S LIFE? I
MEAN, WHAT IF YOU CAN CALL AND
GET THAT INDIVIDUAL OUT OF
HARM'S WAY WOULD BE FABULOUS.
>> HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU
ESTIMATE YOU'VE TRAINED OVER
THE.
>> LAST FEW YEARS? WELL, BRIAN
WANTED TO HAVE THE TRAINING
BACK, AND I GUESS WE DID THAT
BACK IN 2020 OR 21 TO TO REALLY
ENCOURAGE, NOT MANDATE OR, YOU
KNOW, MAKE PEOPLE TAKE IT, BUT
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO TAKE IT FOR
ALL STATE EMPLOYEES. AND I THINK
THERE'S 83,000 STATE EMPLOYEES.
AND THE AGENCIES TOOK THAT UPON
AND DID HAVE THEIR INDIVIDUAL
EMPLOYER EMPLOYEES TAKE IT. SO I
MEAN THAT RIGHT THERE. BUT I
KNOW, I MEAN, I HAVE PEOPLE COME
UP TO ME ALL THE TIME AND SAY,
HOW CAN I HELP? HOW CAN I GET
INVOLVED? AND I SAID, TAKE THE
TRAINING. AND THEY DO. AND I'VE
HAD, YOU KNOW, I ENCOURAGE THEM
TO TELL THEIR PEOPLE THAT THEY
WORSHIP WITH, THAT THEY WORK
WITH. JUST TAKE IT. IT'S 30
MINUTES AND IT'S.
>> THE EDUCATION AND AWARENESS
THAT YOU REALLY HAVE. YOU'VE
BEEN ABLE TO BRING TO LIGHT FOR
SO MANY PEOPLE. I KNOW THAT MUST
BE SOMETHING YOU'RE PROUD OF.
>> WELL, I AM PROUD OF IT. I
HAVE PEOPLE COME UP AND TALK TO
ME ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME, AND
I'M REALLY GLAD IT'S IT'S AN
UGLY TOPIC. NOBODY WANTS TO TALK
ABOUT IT. AND I COMPLETELY
UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT I LIKE TO
TAKE ON TOPICS THAT ARE, YOU
KNOW, THAT PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO
TALK ABOUT. I'M NOT AFRAID OF
THAT UGLINESS BECAUSE THESE
INDIVIDUALS, YOU KNOW, HAVE HAD
A VERY TOUGH CHILDHOOD LIFE, AND
THEY DESERVE SOMEBODY STANDING
UP AND FIGHTING FOR THEM. AND
I'M GOING TO DO THAT. AND I'VE
TOLD THEM THAT I'VE HAD
SURVIVORS COME TO THE GRACE
COMMISSION MEETINGS. AND AT THE
END WE HAVE OPEN PUBLIC
COMMENTS. AND I HAD A COUPLE OF
THEM COME DOWN AND REALLY RAKE
ME OVER THE COALS AND TELL ME I
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS TALKING
ABOUT. AND I SAID, YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT. I DON'T I
DON'T KNOW THE HELL THAT YOU
HAVE BEEN THROUGH, BUT I AM HERE
TO HELP YOU. AND IF I ONLY HELP
ONE PERSON, IF WE ONLY HELP ONE
PERSON, IT'S WORTH IT TO ME.
BUT YOU CAN SIT AT THIS TABLE.
YOU CAN SIT ON THE GRACE
COMMISSION AND PUT YOUR. GIVE US
YOUR INPUT. AND THEY WERE A HUGE
PART OF THE VACANT BILL. WE HAD
THEM COME IN AND TALK TO OUR
POLICY TEAM, AND THEY WERE A
HUGE PART OF THAT. AND THEY
SAID, YOU KNOW, NOBODY'S EVER
ASKED US. NOBODY HAS EVER ASKED
HOW WE THOUGHT. AND I'M LIKE,
HOW COULD WE NOT LEARN FROM, YOU
KNOW, WE CAN LEARN SO MUCH FROM
THEM IF THEY'RE WILLING TO TALK
ABOUT IT. AND IF THEY DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT, I COMPLETELY
UNDERSTAND, BUT I HAD A GROUP OF
THEM COME TO LUNCH AT THE
MANSION, AND WE SAT THERE AND
TALKED WITH SOME OTHER NONPROFIT
ORGANIZATIONS. IT WAS VERY EYE
OPENING TO ME, AND IT WAS VERY
TOUGH. AND BRIAN CAME HOME THAT
NIGHT AND HE SAID, ARE YOU OKAY?
AND I SAID, NO, THIS IS AN UGLY
TOPIC, BUT WE'RE GOING TO IT'S
NOT GOING TO KNOCK ME DOWN.
WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT
AND WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE GOING
TO GET THESE PEOPLE AND PUT THEM
IN JAIL FOR A LONG TIME.
>> I'M SURE IT'S BEEN TOUGH TO
TAKE IT ALL IN. RIGHT. YOU KNOW,
AND.
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S TOUGH TO TALK
TO THEM AND I HUG THEM AND AND
JUST FEEL FOR THEM THAT, YOU
KNOW, PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND IN
THEIR EVERYDAY LIFE THAT THEY'RE
GOING ON WHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING
ON IN THEIR LIFE. YOU KNOW,
IT'S JUST REALLY, REALLY TOUGH
AND JUST REALLY UGLY.
>> I THINK THE BEST THING IS,
YOU SAID THEY CAME TO YOU
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT YOU'RE
INVOLVED IN THIS TOPIC. THAT HAS
MADE IT EASIER, I BET.
>> I THINK SO. YOU KNOW, I FEEL
LIKE PEOPLE LIKE WHEN I TRAVEL
AROUND THE STATE WITH BRIAN,
WHICH PEOPLE MAKE FUN OF ME FOR
TRAVELING EVERYWHERE. BUT I FEEL
LIKE, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE FEEL LIKE
THEY CAN COME UP AND ASK ME
THINGS, AND THEY CAN ALSO SHARE
THINGS WITH ME THAT THEY MAY NOT
FEEL AS COMFORTABLE GOING TO
TALK TO HIM ABOUT. EVEN THOUGH
HE'S VERY APPROACHABLE, I THINK.
BUT, YOU KNOW, THEY FEEL LIKE
THEY CAN COME SPEAK TO ME ABOUT
ISSUES. AND, YOU KNOW, WE'VE HAD
EVERYTHING FROM, YOU KNOW,
MAKING YOUR CDL LICENSE, TAKING
IT AWAY FOR GOOD. IF YOU'RE
CAUGHT USING YOUR YOU KNOW,
TRUCK AS A HUMAN TRAFFICKING
TOOL, YOU KNOW, TO, TO ENTICE
YOUNG GIRLS, BUT THAT , THAT
TAKES IT AWAY FOR LIFE. I MEAN,
IT'S IT'S NOT JUST A SLAP ON
THE HAND. WE MEAN BUSINESS HERE.
AND I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT
IF, AS BRIAN SAID, IN THE STATE
OF THE STATE, IF YOU MESS WITH
OUR CHILDREN, WE'RE COMING AFTER
YOU.
>> YEAH. YOU'VE HIT ALL LEVELS
FROM THE TRUCK DRIVERS YOU
MENTIONED TO HELPING THE GIRLS,
TO GOING AFTER THE PIMPS.
>> ABSOLUTELY. AND ANYBODY THAT
PROFITS, YOU KNOW, THE HOTEL
CLERK THAT IS AT THE FRONT DESK,
THEY'RE SEEING EVERYTHING
THAT'S GOING ON. SO THEY NEED
TO KNOW THAT THEY CAN BE A PART
OF OUR TEAM, NOT A PART OF THAT
TEAM. AND IF THEY ARE A PART OF
THAT TEAM, THEY CAN GET SUED AS
WELL. AND I AND THERE IS A
LAWSUIT RIGHT NOW THAT IS
BECAUSE OF OUR BILL. AND IT THIS
THIS YOUNG INDIVIDUAL WAS
TRAFFICKED IN 2014. SO WE'RE
GOING BACK AND TRYING HELPING
THEM, YOU KNOW , GET SOME
COMPENSATION. THEY HAVE NOTHING
WHEN THEY COME OUT. THEY DON'T
EVEN BARELY HAVE THE CLOTHES ON
THEIR BACK. SO WE WANT TO TRY TO
HELP THEM IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE.
AND THAT WAS ONE THING THAT WAS
VERY IMPORTANT, WAS NOT ONLY
HAVING THE HARSHER PENALTIES,
BUT NOT FORGETTING ABOUT THESE
VICTIMS. ONCE THEY GET OUT, WE
NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THEM. THEY
DESERVE THAT. AND SO WE'VE
WE'VE TRIED TO DO THAT.
>> IS THERE SOMETHING YOU'RE
MOST PROUD OF IN ALL OF THIS?
>> I THINK JUST PEOPLE BEING
AWARE AND FEELING LIKE THEY CAN
TALK ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW, WE'VE
HAD THE UTILITY COMPANIES, WE'VE
HAD THE BEER AND WHOLESALES.
THEY WANT TO PUT STICKERS ON
THEIR CAR. I MEAN, EVERYBODY IS
IS JOINED TOGETHER AND WANT TO
BE A PART OF THE TEAM TO TRY TO
HELP THESE VICTIMS, BECAUSE I
THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE FELT LIKE,
OH, THAT DOESN'T THAT DOESN'T
APPLY TO ME, THAT THAT HADN'T
HAPPENED. THAT DOESN'T THAT'S
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME. WELL,
IT CAN IT CAN HAPPEN TO ANYBODY.
IT DOES NOT HAVE A HALL PASS AT
ALL. SO, YOU KNOW, WITH OUR BIG
BUSY AIRPORTS, WE HAVE A PSA
THERE THAT THE MAYOR AND
REPRESENTATIVE BAZEMORE, BRIAN
AND I AND TYLER PERRY ALL JOINED
TOGETHER AND TALKING ABOUT IT.
SO IT'S A IT'S A, YOU KNOW,
NONPARTIZAN ISSUE THAT WE ARE
ALL COMING TOGETHER. AND LIKE I
SAID, THE LEGISLATORS HAVE
PASSED THAT UNANIMOUSLY. SO THEY
ARE ALL ON BOARD. SO THAT'S VERY
GOOD.
>> IS THERE MORE THAT YOU WANT
TO SEE DONE?
>> YOU KNOW, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE
MORE FACILITIES. I WOULD LIKE TO
SEE INDIVIDUALS GET HELPED MORE.
AND JUST HAVE, YOU KNOW,
THERE'S BUSINESSES THAT HAVE
COME FORWARD THAT WANT TO HELP,
YOU KNOW, HAVE EMPLOYMENT FOR
THEM. SO JUST TALKING ABOUT THAT
MORE, BUT HAVING THE FACILITIES
TO HAVE THEM HEAL AND JUST THEY
NEED TO FEEL SAFE. AND I WANT
THEM TO FEEL SAFE AND KNOW THAT
THERE IS AN OUTLET, THERE IS AN
OPTION TO THIS. AND WE'RE COMING
AFTER THE PERPETRATORS. WE'RE
COMING AFTER THE BAD PEOPLE.
WE'RE GOING TO PUT THEM AWAY
FOR A LONG TIME. I MEAN, THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE HAS
RESCUED ALMOST 200 VICTIMS. I
MEAN, THAT'S GREAT. 200 VICTIMS
THAT ARE OUT OF THAT LIFE. THAT
MAKES ME PROUD.
>> THE FIRST LADY SAYS THE
AMENDED BUDGET THAT THE GOVERNOR
SIGNED RECENTLY ADDS ANOTHER
$1.2 MILLION TO THE HUMAN
TRAFFICKING PROSECUTION UNIT.
SHE SAYS THEY'RE SO BUSY, THEY
REQUESTED ANOTHER PROSECUTOR. I
WANT TO THANK HER FOR THAT
INTERVIEW, BUT THE FIRST LADY IS
NOT FINISHED TRYING TO CHANGE
LAWS TO STOP HUMAN TRAFFICKING.
COMING UP, WE'LL TALK WITH
LEGISLATORS FROM BOTH SIDES OF
THE AISLE ABOUT THE BILLS SHE'S
PUSHING. NOW. WE'LL HEAR FROM A
REPUBLICAN SENATOR AND FROM THE
HOUSE DEMOCRATIC REPRESENTATIVE,
STACEY EVANS. THIS IS LAWMAKERS
ON GPB.
>> GEORGIA FARM BUREAU, A
GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATION
DEDICATED TO PRESERVING GEORGIA
AGRICULTURE. FARM BUREAU
ADVOCATES FOR ALL GEORGIA
FARMERS AT THE STATE CAPITOL
DURING THE SESSION AND YEAR
ROUND. GEORGIA FARM BUREAU, THE
VOICE OF GEORGIA FARMERS.
>> I'M A QUEEN. I DON'T FEAR
ANYONE.
>> THIS IS A WOMAN PEOPLE WANTED
TO FOLLOW. YOU ARE AN IMPORTANT
PART OF OUR WORK.
>> YOU'RE STRONGER THAN YOU
KNOW. SADDLE MY HORSE
IMMEDIATELY.
>> SHE'S A FEMALE TRAILBLAZER.
WE DID IT BY ACKNOWLEDGING OUR
OWN WORTH.
>> OH, PLEASE DO CONTINUE.
>> I GOT MY HEAD OUT THE
SUNROOF. WHOA, WHOA WHOA WHOA.
DA DA DA DA DA.
>> UNDERSTANDING THE PAST GIVES
A SENSE OF THE FUTURE.
>> HEART LIKE A LION.
>> THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT
ANYONE HAS SEEN THIS IN 2000
YEARS.
>> OH OH OH OH. SOMETHING BIG IS
HAPPENING. SO HURRY UP. WE'RE
DIVING IN.
>> THIS IS AMAZING.
>> WELL, I'M EXCITED NOW.
>> POMPEII IS A BATTLE AGAINST
TIME .
>> EYES WIDE OPEN. EYES OPEN.
>> DO YOU THINK I'M JOKING? BUT
LOOK AT THIS. IT DID REALLY
HAPPEN.
>> DON'T LET ANYBODY TELL YOU
WHO YOU ARE.
>> YEAH, I LOVE THIS LIFE.
>> HISTORY TEACHES US TO HONOR
THE PAST.
>> WE'RE JUMPING IN WITH OUR
EYES WIDE OPEN.
>> WHEN YOU LOOK BACK, YOU'RE
LIKE, WOW, THAT WAS PRETTY
SPECIAL.
>> THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S
ACTUALLY ALTERING THE COURSE OF
HISTORY.
>> YOU'RE CHARGED WITH KEEPING
THESE STORIES ALIVE.
>> I KNOW THAT YOU.
>> WELCOME BACK TO LAWMAKERS.
I'M DONNA LOWRY. OVER THE
YEARS, FIRST LADY MARTY KEMP HAS
PUSHED FOR NINE ANTI-TRAFFICKING
BILLS THAT HAVE BECOME LAWS, AND
SHE'S WORKING ON THE TENTH.
AMONG THE LAWS, ONE THAT MAKES
IT A FELONY TO GROOM A MINOR.
ANOTHER ALLOWS HUMAN TRAFFICKING
SURVIVORS TO PETITION COURTS TO
HAVE THEIR SENTENCES VACATED FOR
CRIMES COMMITTED WHILE THEY WERE
VICTIMIZED. AND THERE'S NOW A
LAW THAT REQUIRES CERTAIN
BUSINESSES TO DISPLAY THE HUMAN
TRAFFICKING HOTLINE. NOW, THE
SPONSOR OF THE TENTH BILL, SB
42, IS REPUBLICAN SENATOR BO
HATCHETT OF CORNELIA. I SPOKE
WITH HIM EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON
ABOUT IT.
>> FIRST OFF.
>> I WANT TO THANK FIRST LADY
KEMP FOR ALL SHE'S DONE IN THE
STATE FOR SEX TRAFFICKING
VICTIMS. IT'S REALLY SHE TOOK
ON A LION'S TASK AND HAS DONE
AN INCREDIBLE JOB. SO I WAS
HONORED TO CARRY HER TENTH BILL,
WHICH DEALS WITH ISSUE IN THE
LAW CALLED THE RULE OF LENITY.
AND IT BASICALLY MEANS IF THERE
ARE TWO CRIMES THAT ARE SIMILAR
ENOUGH TO WHERE THEY COULD
OVERLAP, THAT A JUDGE HAS TO
GIVE THE DEFENDANT THE LESSER
PENALTY. AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS
WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH SEX
TRAFFICKING A MINOR, THERE HAVE
BEEN TWO JUDGES THAT HAVE STATED
THAT THE THAT CRIME OVERLAPS
WITH PIMPING AND PANDERING OF A
MINOR, AND WHAT WE BASICALLY
HAVE TO DO IS MAKE THAT
CORRECTION SO THAT WHEN SOMEONE
DOES SEX TRAFFICKING A MINOR,
THAT THEY WILL GET THE FULLEST
EXTENT OF THE PENALTY AVAILABLE.
>> AS I UNDERSTAND IT,
PROSECUTORS CAME TO THE FIRST
LADY ABOUT THIS.
>> THAT'S RIGHT. THEY DID.
IT'S BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN TWO
JUDGES, ONE IN CHEROKEE COUNTY
AND ONE IN COBB COUNTY, THAT
BROUGHT THIS RULE OF LENITY
ISSUE TO US, OR TO THE FIRST
LADY. AND THEN WE WERE ABLE TO
CRAFT LEGISLATION AROUND IT TO
MAKE SURE THAT WHEN SOMEONE DOES
SEX TRAFFICKING A MINOR, THEY
ARE PUNISHED TO THE FULL EXTENT
OF THE LAW. AND THIS
TECHNICALITY DOESN'T ALLOW THEM
TO GET OFF A LITTLE BIT EASIER.
>> THE GOOD THING ABOUT ALL OF
THIS IS THE ATTENTION THAT'S
BEEN DRAWN TO IT. IT'S MAKING
PEOPLE WITHIN THE SYSTEM
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S NEEDED TO BE
ABLE TO GET YOU GUYS TO DO WHAT
YOU NEED TO DO TO MAKE THE LAWS
STRONGER, RIGHT?
>> THAT'S RIGHT. I MEAN, THE
GRACE COMMISSION AND OTHER
ADVOCATES AROUND THE STATE, NOT
JUST FOR THIS ISSUE, BUT OTHER
ISSUES. THAT'S THEY BRING US
IDEAS AND THEY BRING US ISSUES
THAT WE DON'T ALWAYS SEE. AND I
THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE
TO SEND TO PEOPLE. IF YOU DO
HAVE AN ISSUE, GET ENGAGED, GET
INVOLVED, REACH OUT TO YOUR
LEGISLATOR BECAUSE YOU NEVER
KNOW WHAT COULD BE A WHAT COULD
BE WRITTEN INTO A PIECE OF
LEGISLATION AND WHAT COULD BE
BROUGHT UP NEXT SESSION.
>> AND THEY THINK THE GREAT
THING ABOUT THIS IN THE SENATE,
OVERWHELMING SUPPORT.
>> OH, YEAH, I DON'T THINK THERE
WAS A NO VOTE. IT WAS A GREAT
PIECE OF LEGISLATION MOVING
THROUGH THE HOUSE NOW, AND
HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET IT PASSED
DEFINITELY BEFORE SIGNING DAY.
BUT I'D LIKE TO SEE IT PASSED
TOMORROW IF WE CAN GET IT. TIP
MY HAT TO MARTY KEMP AND ALL
THAT SHE'S DOING. SHE TOOK ON A
VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE IN THE
STATE, AND HER EFFORTS ARE BEING
SEEN AND SAVING LIVES.
>> AND IT'S NOT AN EASY ISSUE.
IT'S IT'S SOMETHING A LOT OF
PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT.
>> NO. YOU'RE RIGHT, AND IT'S
UNCOMFORTABLE. BUT I'LL SAY
THAT IN MY YEARS HERE, THE
VICTIMS THAT HAVE COME FORWARD
AND THAT HAVE TESTIFIED IN
COMMITTEE AND SHOWN THEIR
BRAVERY HAVE HAS MADE A HUGE
IMPACT. AND THE STORIES THAT
THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO TELL HAVE
HELPED US CONTINUE TO CRAFT
LEGISLATION TO PROTECT FUTURE
VICTIMS. SO I WANT TO THANK THEM
AND THANK THE GOVERNOR AND THE
FIRST LADY FOR ALL, ALL THE WORK
THAT THEY'VE DONE, BECAUSE THIS
IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE.
>> AND I WANT TO THANK SENATOR
HATCHETT FOR THAT INTERVIEW.
NOW, HIS BILL IS NOW IN THE
HOUSE WHERE OUR NEXT GUEST WILL
VOTE ON IT. DEMOCRATIC
REPRESENTATIVE STACEY EVANS OF
ATLANTA. HER COMMITTEE IN THE
HOUSE INCLUDE APPROPRIATIONS,
JUDICIARY AND RULES. AND THANK
YOU FOR COMING ON THE SHOW.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING
ME.
>> SO LET'S START A LITTLE BIT
WITH SENATOR HATCH'S BILL, THIS
SB 42 AND WHAT IT MIGHT DO. WHAT
CAN YOU TELL US ANYTHING MORE.
>> IT'S A GREAT BILL AND IT'S A
GREAT EXAMPLE, DONNA, OF WHY
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR IF YOU SEE
SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING.
KNOWING THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT
FIGURED OUT THIS ISSUE AND
BROUGHT IT TO THE FIRST LADY,
AND THEN WE WERE ABLE TO ACT
UPON IT, BECAUSE THERE ARE SO
MANY WAYS THAT OUR LAWS WORK
TOGETHER, THAT THOSE OF US UNDER
THE DOME MAY NOT REALIZE IF WE
DON'T WORK IN THAT AREA, IF
WE'RE JUST NOT AWARE OF IT. AND
SO I ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE, IF YOU
SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING,
DON'T ASSUME THAT I KNOW WHAT
YOU KNOW. BRING IT TO ME. AND
THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT
WORKING OUT REALLY WELL TO MAKE
SURE THAT WE CLOSE THE LOOPHOLE
AND THAT WE HOLD THESE PEOPLE
ACCOUNTABLE AS MUCH AS WE CAN.
>> YEAH. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS
OVERALL ON WHAT THE FIRST LADY
HAS DONE WITH THE TENT? THIS IS
HER TENTH BILL OVER THE YEARS ON
THIS TOPIC OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING.
>> IT'S AMAZING. I MEAN, I AM
SO GRATEFUL FOR GEORGIA, FOR
THESE VICTIMS THAT WE HAVE.
FIRSTLY, MARTY KEMP AND HER
WHOLE HEART AND HER WHOLE EFFORT
IS INTO THIS. AND AND WE HAVE
HER TO THANK. I REMEMBER WHEN I
FIRST CAME TO THE CAPITOL IN
2011, THAT WAS MY FIRST SESSION,
AND PEOPLE DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO
SAY THE WORDS SEX TRAFFICKING.
NOBODY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IT.
AND SLOWLY BUT SURELY WE
STARTED. BUT THEN WHEN GOVERNOR
KEMP WAS ELECTED AND MARTY KEMP
BECAME OUR FIRST LADY, IT'S JUST
EXPLODED. THE THE HELP FOR THESE
VICTIMS. AND IT'S AMAZING.
>> AND THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE
THEY HAVE TO HIDE FROM HER AT
LEAST AND GET GETTING THAT
INFORMATION OUT. SO IT'S TAKEN
AWAY SOME SHAME. I WANT TO TALK
ABOUT ANOTHER BILL. YOU'RE A
SIGNER ON REPRESENTATIVE DEBRA
BAZEMORE BILL, HB 490. THAT
WOULD REQUIRE HOTELS TO PROVIDE
HUMAN TRAFFICKING TRAINING
PROGRAMS. TALK ABOUT THAT A
LITTLE BIT.
>> IT'S A GREAT PIECE OF
LEGISLATION THAT JUST
COMPLEMENTS ALL THAT'S GOING ON.
THESE SEX TRAFFICKING VICTIMS
ARE BROUGHT INTO THESE MOTELS BY
THEIR PIMPS, AND THE HOTEL
RECEPTIONIST, THE FOLKS THAT
WORK THERE THAT MIGHT CLEAN THE
ROOMS THAT DO SECURITY, THEY
NEED TO KNOW WHAT TO LOOK OUT
FOR. AND SO I THINK THIS WOULD
JUST BE A GREAT WAY TO HAVE MORE
EYES ON THE PROBLEM, TO TRY TO
CATCH THINGS BEFORE THEY GET OUT
OF HAND, OR CERTAINLY TO SAVE
THESE WOMEN FROM FROM THIS HARM
THAT'S HAPPENING TO THEM.
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT BILL DID NOT
MOVE IN THE HOUSE, BUT OBVIOUSLY
WE'RE IN THE FIRST YEAR OF A
TWO YEAR SESSION. AND SO WE'LL
LOOK FORWARD TO HOPEFULLY
PASSING THAT OUT NEXT YEAR. OR
IF OUR FRIENDS IN THE SENATE SEE
FIT TO ADD IT TO SOMETHING
THAT'S MOVING OVER THERE, OR WE
CAN ADD IT ON TO SOMETHING ON
OUR SIDE, I HOPE THAT WE WILL.
>> OKAY, WELL, LET'S GET ON TO
YOUR AN ATTORNEY AND YOU
PRESENTED THE MINORITY REPORT
TODAY ON THE TORT REFORM BILL.
AND ONE OF THE AREAS YOU
ADDRESSED IS THE CARVE OUT FOR
SEX TRAFFICKING VICTIMS THAT
CAME OUT UP AFTER THE SENATE
PASSED IT. TELL US WHAT YOU
THINK OF THAT PART OF THE
LEGISLATION.
>> SO SENATE BILL 68 IS A BIG
REWRITE OF SOME OF OUR CIVIL
JUSTICE LAWS, CIVIL PROCEDURE,
AND ONE SPECIFIC AREA THAT'S
ADDRESSED IS WHAT'S KNOWN AS
PREMISES LIABILITY. AND HOW YOU
HOLD OWNERS AND OCCUPIERS LIABLE
WHEN PEOPLE GET HURT ON THEIR
PROPERTY, WHEN THEY HAVE DROPPED
THE BALL ON SECURITY AND ALLOW
FOLKS TO GET HURT, EVEN THOUGH
THEY'RE INVITING CUSTOMERS ONTO
THEIR PROPERTY. AND SO FOR SEX
TRAFFICKING, THIS RELATES MOSTLY
TO THE MOTELS AND THE WAY THAT
THE BILL WAS WRITTEN BEFORE
WOULD HAVE MADE IT NEARLY
IMPOSSIBLE FOR SEX TRAFFICKING
VICTIMS TO HOLD THE HOTELS
ACCOUNTABLE. AND I CAN'T SAY
ENOUGH HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE
THAT. GOVERNOR KEMP AND SENATOR
KENNEDY AND THOSE THAT WERE
WORKING ON THIS BILL, MADE THIS
CARVE OUT SO THAT THE NEW HIGHER
STANDARDS AND THE NEW CONDITIONS
THAT YOU HAVE TO MEET TO BRING A
NEGLIGENT SECURITY CASE WILL NOT
APPLY IF YOU ARE A VICTIM OF SEX
TRAFFICKING. AND IT'S GOOD. BUT
WHAT I SAID FROM THE WELL AND
WHAT I'LL SAY HERE IS THAT I
APPRECIATE BEING ABLE TO PROTECT
THESE VICTIMS, BUT I DON'T
UNDERSTAND WHY WE ARE JUST
PICKING THIS CERTAIN CLASS OF
VICTIMS TO PROTECT. TO ME, IT'S
AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT THE LAW
GOES TOO FAR, THAT IT HURTS
VICTIMS. AND IF WE'RE GOING TO
CARVE OUT VICTIMS OF SEX
TRAFFICKING TO MAKE SURE THAT
THEIR CLAIMS CAN STILL GO
THROUGH. WHAT ABOUT VICTIMS OF
SEXUAL ASSAULT? WHAT ABOUT
VICTIMS OF RAPE IN A STAIRWELL?
WHAT ABOUT OTHER CRIME? VICTIMS
OF MURDERS AND BEATINGS AND
STABBINGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT?
I REALLY WISH THAT WE COULD HAVE
SLOWED DOWN AND HELPED ALL THOSE
VICTIMS.
>> YEAH. I WANT TO GET INTO
SOMETHING ELSE YOU TALKED ABOUT
IN TERMS OF TORT REFORM FORM, A
LOT OF WHAT WE'VE HEARD WITH
TORT REFORM HAS TO DO WITH
INSURANCE REFORM, THAT IT'S
NEEDED AND IT IS LIKELY TO COME
UP NEXT YEAR. WE KEEP HEARING
THAT YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT WILL
HAPPEN.
>> I HOPE IT HAPPENS. HOPE
SPRINGS ETERNAL. I SPEAKER BURNS
ANNOUNCED THAT TODAY. I HAD NOT
HEARD OF THAT UNTIL TODAY. BUT
HERE'S MY QUESTION FOR THE
SPEAKER AND OTHERS AT HOME. IF
WE WERE SO CERTAIN THAT PREMIUMS
WERE RISING BECAUSE OF LAWSUITS
AND THAT WAS CREATING THIS
INSURANCE CRISIS WHY DO WE NEED
AN INSURANCE STUDY TO FIND OUT
WHETHER THAT'S TRUE OR NOT? IT
SEEMS LIKE WE SHOULD HAVE DONE
THAT FIRST, INSTEAD OF DOING
THIS WHOLESALE REWRITE OF OUR
CIVIL PRACTICE ACT. IT SEEMS
LIKE WE PUT THE CART BEFORE THE
HORSE BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE IF
WE DO AN HONEST STUDY OF
INSURANCE REFORM, WE MAY FIND
OUT THAT INSURERS WERE NOT BEING
AS TRUTHFUL TO US AS WE HAD
HOPED THEY WOULD BE. IN TELLING
US WHY PREMIUMS WERE RISING.
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED
IN FLORIDA. AND THE SPEAKER OF
THE HOUSE HAS HAS CALLED FOR AN
INVESTIGATION AND SAYS WE GOT
DUPED. BASICALLY, THEY CAME TO
US AND SAID THERE WAS THIS
CRISIS. AND IF WE DIDN'T DO
LAWSUIT REFORM, THEN ALL THE
INSURERS WERE GOING TO HAVE TO
LEAVE THE STATE BECAUSE THEY
WERE LOSING MONEY. SO THEY
STOPPED AND DID AN
INVESTIGATION. WE DECIDED TO
FOLLOW THEIR LEAD AND ALSO DO
LAWSUIT REFORM, BELIEVING THE
INSURERS THAT WE HAD THIS
CRISIS. AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO
FIND OUT IF IT'S TRUE OR NOT.
THAT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO
ME.
>> NOW, I KNOW YOU DID NOT VOTE
FOR IT. IT WAS A CLOSE VOTE. DID
IT SURPRISE YOU HOW CLOSE IT
WAS?
>> NO. I KNEW IT WOULD BE CLOSE.
IT DID SURPRISE ME THAT IT
PASSED. I THOUGHT I THOUGHT WE
HAD THE VOTES TO TO BEAT IT, AND
THAT WAS DISAPPOINTING. I'M
DISAPPOINTED FOR GEORGIA AND
THOSE THAT NEED ACCESS TO THE
COURTS. AND HONESTLY, I'M. I'M
FEELING A LITTLE BAD FOR OUR
JUDGES RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THEY'RE
GOING TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A
MESS ON, ON THEIR HANDS TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT ALL THE CHANGES
THAT WE'VE JUST DONE AND THAT
ARE GOING TO GO INTO EFFECT
IMMEDIATELY UPON THE GOVERNOR'S
SIGNATURE. THAT'S VERY
DIFFERENT. THEY USUALLY DON'T
GO INTO EFFECT RIGHT AWAY.
>> OKAY. WELL, THANKS SO MUCH
FOR COMING. THAT DOES IT FOR
TODAY FOR LAWMAKERS. THANK YOU
SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. WE'LL
SEE YOU NEXT TUESDAY. BYE BYE.
