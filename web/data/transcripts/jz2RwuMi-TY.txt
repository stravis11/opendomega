TRANSCRIPT
----------
Morning. Is that time of the year? And what we get started, we're going to ask
Chairman Jasper's if you would with the opens for the word of prayer, please.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It's all by our heads, please.
Heavenly Father, thank you for this upcoming week and that most importantly,
thanks for the glorious weekend we just had. You know, Heavenly Father,
please be a presence in our lives as we go through this week.
Please give us patience, kindness, and wisdom,
because we certainly will need it.
And for our friend Terry England, Lord, thank you
for your healing hands around him and his progression.
And we work in your word and your name today, Amen.
Thank you, Jim.
Okay.
Let's get started.
Actually, Mary Margaret Oliver.
I bring your attention to House Bill 399 that's at the very top of page 5.
399 comes to us from the Government Affairs Committee that has had a good discussion
about the phenomena of out-of-state property owners buying significant numbers of single
family homes.
And House Bill 399 is one step forward to require that an out-of-state property owner that
owns more than 25 single family homes must have a Georgia real estate broker or
and or a person in Georgia. We need a presence in Georgia for this
significant phenomena of purchase taking away the limited supply of single
family homes. We had a good hearing about the significant percentages of
single family homes that are purchased all over Atlanta is a national
target. This is a national issue and I am pleased to bring you this modest reform forward
that will assist our families, purchase single family homes that at least know, at least
know who is the owner and who is responsible for the repairs.
Okay, don't see any questions. Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you.
Yes, ma'am.
Good morning, Mr. Chair. And thank you. Thank you, committee, for allowing me to present my bill, which is
which will establish a three year pilot immersive writing program and grant funding for all public school students in grades two to five to participate.
The writing program aligns with the current writing standards established by the State Board of Education and can be integrated into the existing curriculum.
In addition, this bill requires playgrounds be included in all new school constructions in order to address the physical, sensory, cognitive, social, emotional,
and communication needs of students.
Okay, don't see any questions, thank you, ma'am.
Yeah.
Representative Neil.
Thank you to the chair, thank you to the committee.
Today I bring to you House Bill 229.
That's going to be on the very back page of the document.
document. All this bill does allows for local school districts who have e-splossed capital
building projects to have their local sales taxes exempt when they purchase construction
materials. This just allows for school districts to save a few dollars during their development
which they can reinvest in their communities later. And with that, Mr. Chair, I ask for your
Okay. I don't see any questions. Thank you.
Yes, ma'am.
Good morning, Mr. Chair and to the members of the committee.
I present to you today House Bill 563, which is found on page 6 at the bottom.
This bill will allow for licensed doctors of physical therapy
to verify via affidavit for an individual
to receive a disabled parking permit
and as stated in the bill to obtain special vehicle decals
is the proper term.
Licensed physical therapists would join in
with licensed chiropractors, licensed optometrist,
doctors of osteopathic medicine,
and licensed doctor of pediatric medicine.
Physical therapists are highly trained and qualified
to identify, recognize, and treat movement disorders
and rehabilitation as well as habitation.
I ask for your favorable consideration
of House Bill five, six, three.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, ma'am.
Don't see any questions.
Let's leave a deal here.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
morning, I'll be reading, uh, getting, presenting to you House Bill 465, the substitute on page 5 down to the bottom.
This is a substitute because we had the privilege of working with the GDI on this saving life's bill. It is the missing autism alert bill.
We've had a lot of unfortunate family members that have either been
a casualty or suffered missing or gravitating to roads or waterways.
So this will be an alert system directed through the GBI and we hope that it will
save lives. Mr. Chairman, we ask for your favorable consideration on House Bill 465.
Thank you, sir. I don't see any questions. There's two cocks.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. House Bill 127 is page one, the last one on the page. This is a teacher,
a teacher bill, and a school personnel. Currently, they earn 1.25 days, sick days per month,
where three of those days can be used for personal days simply changing the
three days to five to encourage our teachers for additional personal days
that they can use from their sick days. Nice for your favorable consideration.
Okay, don't see any questions. Thanks, sir. Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, 4th page, level 1 down, House Bill 351.
All right, thank you, everybody's there.
What we're doing with House Bill 351, AC443100S, the sod of waste handling facility permitting
has long been a source of litigation.
This litigation is intent to revise the Solid Waste Act to remove provisions deemed unconstitutional and just clarify responsibilities of public hearings who's required to do what for the county, the EPD is just keep us out of lawsuits and save money.
So that's the intent of House Bill 351.
Okay, I don't see any questions you got another yes, I do house bill 371 14th one down on the fourth page
And it's LC 492236
All right under the quality basic education act all we're doing here. We're just increasing the state's
maximal authorization
For capital outlay funding from 300 million to 375 and I said maximum
We can appropriate less than that, but not over 375.
That number has not been raised since 2007.
And will it not take effect until 2027?
Would rate of inflation alone since 2014 is
when it's over 33%.
So this just trying to get us back in line
with what actual construction cost are today.
OK, don't see any questions.
Thank you, Chair.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and members of the committee.
Yes, ma'am.
Good morning, Mr. Chair, members.
Today I'm here to bring House Bill 647.
This bill is annexing 45 small parcels into Mulberry.
Oh, it's, let me tell you the page.
I believe it's on page seven.
This bill is annexing 45 small parcels into Mulberry.
All of these parcels are in my district.
The commissioners we have been told will not be opposing this bill.
The commissioners would win it.
Okay, you have a question.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the general lead a yield for a question or two?
I do.
So that is not my understanding that Gwyneth County commissioners are supportive of this bill.
My understanding is that they're in ongoing negotiations.
Is that not true?
That is not something I am aware of.
I had a discussion this morning and was told that they were told the commissioners were
told that it was in their best interest just to allow us.
Again, not what I've heard from the representative of Gwyneth County who I spoke with this morning
as well.
Isn't not true that as we have some local annexation bills that this bill provides
no opportunity for residents to say whether or not they would want to proceed and may
may also lack local control and transparency
had it's currently drafted.
Mulberry is brought about because the people
wanted to have more control.
So I would say that that statement is not true
because that is why it was brought about.
The people want more control.
Control over what is going to be done there.
One final question.
Is it not true that the creation of the city of Mulberry
was privileged to the extent that it did not follow
the traditional two-year timeline that it takes
to create new cities?
And which again, I remain concerned in which again, we are seeing these unilateral actions
taken without full agreement and an opportunity for transparency in the people to provide input
and to significant actions that may affect both Gwinnett County, second largest county
in the state and the city.
So I would say that this city was taken to a vote.
It was passed by a large number of people, so I would have to disagree with that.
Okay, you have another question, boy.
There's a more.
Do you have a question?
Oh, I mean, I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I did have a question for the bill sponsor.
Did this bill have bipartisan support
within the local Gwinnett County delegation?
Because it is strictly in my district
and it was assigned to general, to be a general bill,
I have spoken with some of the members, but I did not discuss it as a vote.
Okay, but so to your knowledge, last question, do any democratic members of the Gwinnett County delegation support your bill?
I have spoken with two that have said that they are not concerned with it, that they're not concerned with it.
The other one said that he's going to make a statement regarding the bill.
Thank you.
Okay, I don't see any other questions, thank you.
Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, I have three bills I spoke to you about before.
House Bill 298 was something to help our nurses, House Bill 320 was something to help
our environment and House Bill 432 on the fifth page, the Eliturkey Conservation, Bill
I'm here to present today is House Bill 482 at the bottom of the fifth page, which
It codifies a practice of allowing judicial officers in circuits that have over 15 superior court judges.
Okay, you don't see any questions.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Jim?
Jim?
Thank you, Chairman Parrish.
Members, out of the committee, I come to you first with House Bill 175.
That's second page eight down.
This is an apartment bill, decal is basically, I'm working with decal to get them in line with the federal requirements set out by the FBI around background checks.
Today, in the past year, they do about 70,000 a year to keep our youngest safe.
And this goes through the entire ecosystem of every individual that would be, quote, involved within the decal organization statewide.
That's the summary of the bill, sir.
I don't see any question.
You have another one.
Yes, sir.
House Bill 652, 11 down on page 7.
This is also a cleanup bill in some way, but not a department cleanup bill.
As you recall two years ago, Chairman Jasper's was the sponsor of an EV bill that did a
myriad of different things, including an excise tax.
This bill, working with Chairman Jasper's, we would basically exempt one charitable organization
called the Ray, which is an experiential organization that does transportation, I'll say work in
advanced modalities. And they had put in an EV charger over 10 years ago that is exclusively
charge or it provides electricity from a solar array, not from the grid. It's on the federal
right of way and it does not charge and it does level three charging at about 175 kilowatts an hour.
What we're asking for in this bill for them to be exempt. And one of the clarifications that we
here in order to not open up Pandoora's box was to make sure there was an
operation by January 1 2025. That's the summary Mr. Chairman. Okay, don't see any
questions. Thank you, sir. Yes, sir. Come on up.
Good morning. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and to members of the committee. Today I am
presenting House Bill 335, which is on page 4 and this is 6th from the top.
House Bill 335 raises awareness of mental health resources available to student athletes and requires coaches to annually review materials and guidelines about mental health risk.
There's no cost associated with this and the implementation of this bill would mirror that of current concussion and cardiac arrest protocols.
It's fully supported by the Georgia High School Association.
Okay, don't see any questions on that.
You have a resolution for us also.
Yes sir, thank you very much.
I do have a resolution that's on page seven
and it's the eighth from the bottom.
House resolution 130 is legislation to compensate
Mrs. Cedric Moore, who was wrongfully convicted
for 21 years for a crime that he did not commit.
Modern DNA testing revealed that Mr. Moore was not
the culprit of the act committed.
Thus, the charges against him were dismissed
and he was officially exonerated.
Mr. Moore had no prior criminal record
and he hasn't been a model citizen since this release
and so I asked for his body's favorable consideration.
Okay, I don't see any questions.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, the members of the committee.
Reaction of Townsend.
More Mr. Chair, thank you very much.
If you turn to page, top of page three, House Bill 235,
it is LC492305S.
Basically, this is a cleanup from a bill a few years ago.
It's the George Education Living Donor Educators Act.
It allows pay time leave off for secondary,
post-secondary teachers and full time staff employees
to donate an organ and have received that pay time leave.
Okay, don't see any questions. Thank you, sir.
Okay.
Chairman Golly.
Good morning. This is House Bill 522. It's on page 6,
middle of the way down. What this bill does is it prohibits
organ transplant centers from discriminating against organ transplants
recipients based solely due to their COVID-19 vaccination status.
It's a bill we passed last year, got hung up in the Senate, and I think we're going to try it again.
Okay.
Do have a question for you.
Lady Hughley, is that your...
Okay.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Can you tell me why we need this bill?
Why we need this bill?
Yes.
Well, even lately, so COVID, we feel like we're behind this a little bit, even lately.
Lately, January 13th, there's a news article,
mom declined second, COVID shot,
and now Dartmouth Hitchcock is denying her transplant.
February 14th, child refuse heart transplant
over vaccination status, it's really the COVID-19.
This happening today, COVID-19 vaccination
is something that is continuing to get pushed
by some of these organ transplant centers,
but I think there's a number of people who rightly so,
don't wanna get vaccinated for it.
I got vaccinated for it, I'm not an anti-vaxer,
But I think it's become a political thing and you have a right to get an organ transplant
I believe and it should be based on COVID-19 status.
Isn't it true that I just went through a heart transplant with my brother-in-law and
they have to have those vaccines done so that they can move forward with the work to make
sure that they're not going to be somehow compromised because of the cost associated with these
organ transplants. I'm very concerned about what you're proposing here because we're
dabbling in the practice of medicine even more than what we normally do.
Well I think I'm sorry to hear I hope that they're healing and I hope that I'm on the
good end of that transplant. This is not something that we're dabbling with medicine.
just saying, the only criteria that you cannot be excluded from is COVID-19 vaccination.
And not all centers do it today, only some centers, so I think that shows that it's not such
a dependency.
This is important that you have viability of the organ receiver.
You want those organs to, they're very precious.
You want them to be used for the right people, and for people who are going to succeed
and I don't think, or who have a vaccination is a hindrance to that.
Okay, you have another question, Mr. Miller.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
So to your last point, to the sponsor, to your last point, isn't it a fairly complex
assessment about what kind of patient is appropriate for organ donation period?
Yes, for sure.
Okay, and so medical professionals do they not have a whole list of things that a person
cannot do in order to be qualified for an urban transplant, correct?
I think it's holistic.
There are certain people just because you have your diabetic doesn't mean you're excluded
from getting a transplant just because you're just because you were a drinker in your life
doesn't mean you're excluded.
I'm just trying to say just because you don't have your COVID-19 vaccination solely based.
You can have other reasons that you don't get that that that transplanted on qualify, but specifically to the COVID-19 vaccination.
One more question. Is it not true that if a patient does not survive due to the illness that the organ that has been transplanted into that person cannot then go to another person?
Do you understand my question?
So basically if you guys if you receive a transplant and you pass away that same organ can't be used again, is that what you're saying?
for a correct, for an MU-compromised person.
But I think there are a lot of vaccinations out there.
Just the COVID-19 vaccination specifically
as a sole discrimination factor.
It's about the sole discrimination factors.
If you have problems, most likely there's other discriminating
factors that would not allow you to have a building transplant.
Thank you.
Chairman Hawking, do you have a question?
Isn't it true that COVID has so many variants now
that the vaccine you may be given today
may not be effective in two weeks?
And this is one of the reasons you're bringing this bill.
That's correct.
Thank you.
Chairman Martin, you got a quick question.
Just a quick question.
I think a gentleman explained it, but I just want to, again,
you would, if you had comorbidities,
if you had drank a lot and you had diabetes
and you had other things and you had the COVID shot,
you could still be denied because of the COVID,
The total of it all you just are trying to do the one simple thing doesn't take you off
the list.
That's right.
That's right.
That's right.
Thanks, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Here in the bar.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, bringing you House Bill 224.
It's on the second page, second from the bottom.
This is a piece of legislation that was brought to us by the leadership of Fort Stewart.
It would simply allow the state of Georgia through GDOT to enter into a regional governmental
support agreement for the purposes of doing work on our military installations.
No costs to the state.
This would simply allow vendors through the DOT to do work on our installations.
It would help get that work done faster more efficiently, and there is an economic benefit
to our state vendors for that.
Don't say any questions.
Thank you, sir.
I think Mr. Chairman, many, many members, come on in.
I have HB 575 at the top of sheet 7.
It's a Georgia DOT department bill.
It has four sections.
The first section essentially gives the DOT a little bit more flexibly.
Flexibility due to newspapers not being printed daily now.
someone will go once a week so that gives them a little more flexibility on
posting it doesn't change how the two postings they already have for public
hearings. Second section gives the department the ability to negotiate with
condominiums for only common areas and so it gives them the ability just to
negotiate with the condominium associations. Third section codifies the
DOD trip program and essentially what that does is let some paid bonuses far
are picking up a tractor trailer, 16,000 pounds an hour over to get them out of the road
and get the roads open faster on the interstates.
And the fourth section gives the department a head start on getting utilities moved on
the widening of state road projects so they can get ahead and start and get the projects
going faster.
I'll stand for any questions.
Okay.
Don't see any questions, thanks sir.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Here we can.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I have House Bill 12 LC number 499-002S.
HB 12 passed the House nearly unanimously last year.
As a quick refresher of what HB 12 does is simply lower the threshold
for equalization eligibility from 14 mils down to 10.
It doesn't change the formula for equalization, it doesn't change the formula for QBE.
It doesn't change the local 5 mil share requirement.
It would allow, allow, not require a local school system that receives equalization to simply roll back their milledrate over time to a new minimum threshold of 10.
The bill also includes a penalty provision for those school systems who sometime in the future might roll back their millage under the new proposed threshold of 10.
There is no penalty in the code as of today.
this bill has a 25% penalty on equalization
if a school system rolls back under the new proposed threshold.
I appreciate the help from Chairman Erwin
in the speak of pro-tim and crafting language.
That's the bill.
I'm happy to answer any questions.
OK.
I don't see any questions.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
OK.
Any members of the committee have requests?
Okay, you've got several Chairman Stevens.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, on page five,
at the bottom of the page, House Bill 473,
is the department, drugs and narcotics,
and the board of pharmacies, annual update bill.
Drug update.
If you have a question, raise your hand,
I've got several lives, blanking, okay?
No questions, thanks sir.
I've approved ten.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I'd like to ask the committee's favor,
favorable consideration of House Bill 614 that's halfway down page 7.
It would prohibit the use or ignition of consumer firework within a hundred yards of a commercial
facility housing equines in a confined area.
It would add this use to a long list that's currently in law restricting fireworks within
100 yards because of a danger to the people who work with horses and the horses themselves.
One difference between this use and any other uses that are fit this category of 100 yards,
it would require the passage of a local ordinance by the city or county to put it in effect.
So it would not go in effect anywhere in the state without a local ordinance and the local
ordinance would allow for special use permits, even if they put the ordinance into a fact.
Okay, no questions. Thank you. My share, Leverett.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have two new bills on the blue sheet. One is on the first page.
It's the second one in the modified structure rule section. It's House Bill 37 came out
education committee it would just require local school systems to notify employees if the school
system would hold Social Security and not. School systems are exempt and some many of them across
the state do not and the number of employees have had unfavorable surprises upon retirement. So
we're just trying to make sure that they're made aware of that. The other bill is House Bill 339
and that would just the titles will misleading because of the perceptions that would exempt
rideshare drivers from the Motor Carrier Act have been removed.
That was in response to a court of appeals decision.
Now the only thing remaining in the bill is the final section would simply confirm the
existing law that those drivers, that the rideshare service doesn't have the
carious liability for the acts of the drivers because they're independent
contractors and those are the two buildings, Chairman.
Okay, don't see any questions on those two bills.
Okay, Chair Lee Cooper, you have a request.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Yes, sir.
That House Bill 91 on the first page.
It's the one on specialty vets.
And it's the one that had a scribbner error.
And it's been corrected.
And it was already slated to be on the floor for a vote.
And I would ask that it be put back.
Thank you.
Okay.
Thank you.
Don't see any questions on that 91.
Chairman Hawkins.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, the top of page 4, 322, the board of dentistry issuance of a dental license
Not including dental hygiene. What number is it? 322, okay
Top page 4
This is teaching license for sole purpose of teaching foreign
Well, these will be foreign faculty right now our clinical faculty stands at only 80%
at MCG. Then the second one on top of page 7571, this is bill we had last year, dealing
with radiology assistance. It was left on the table that in the Senate, this involves
actually access to care, increasing availability of radiological images being read.
Okay. Do you have a resolution, also?
I could. 72.
I don't know where it is on here, but yeah, that's for the Cancer Coalition Study Committee on Cancer Care.
Yeah, first page.
Oh, yes. Okay. Thank you.
Appreciate that, help.
Oh, okay. I don't guess we have any questions about that. Okay. Chairman Powell.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I've already asked for 24745467. Today I'd like to ask on the yellow
sheet House Bill 651. This is a bill that cleans up the contentious issue that we've
dealing with the red light of the speeds on camera bill. This puts very strict
parameters around these these devices gets back to the original purpose of the
public safety and I'd be glad to go on to develop it just briefly. It puts
specific times that they can run these cameras have to have flashing sight
flashing signs that give the speed of the oncoming vehicle and then where the money
goes is divided that half of any of all these fines will go back to the public
schools in that district for schools. Okay. I have a question for you. Jim Stevens.
Thank you, Miss Chairman. Just curious I hadn't seen the bill yet but is there
any penalty for the camera manufacturers for these defaulty cameras that may
send out a bill that's an error. Well under the current law and no there's not
because under the established legislation, current legislation, the local police
authorities are supposed to review those citations. Something that I don't think
is always about practice among these folks. So when somebody gets tagged with one of
these speeding violations, that police jurisdiction is running these and authorizing these, they're
supposed to review them before those citations go out.
I'll also say one of the things that we've done is clean up some of the existing state
love of saying that most people don't realize, but we have always had a policy in the state
of Georgia on radar, in your radar device, you've got to be running more than 10 miles
over the speed limit for that radar to kick in on the leisure of state control.
And we have access, but that in there and cleaned up a lot of the local legislation that deals with this so that 25
actually means 35.
Okay, don't see any other questions.
Thanks, sir.
Chairman Newton.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
On the back page, under structure rule, House Bill 144 deals with how we train physicians and our
practitioners and PAs, it's important that they get outside the tertiary care hospitals
to get their training. This continues and reauthorizes a medical preceptor program. It expands
it a little bit to include dental students and dentists as well to be included along
with physicians, nurse practitioners and PAs.
Okay, don't see any questions. Thanks, sir.
here in Dempsey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On page 7 about midway down, House Bill 612.
This will add a member to the Behavioral Health Coordinating Council, specifically the Commissioner
of Insurance, and will also establish a parity compliance review panel within the Council
to help address the challenges we are still facing and parity between mental health and
Okay, I don't see any questions on that.
Thank you, Chairman Irving, is that you?
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I'll also on page seven about halfway down HR 145,
what this does is as we're walking down the path
of trying to do a better job of teaching
and our kids reading in school,
this is working with the expansion of the vision
and hearing screening, so we're catching those kids at an earlier age and helping them
through their handicap.
Okay.
You don't see any questions?
Thanks, sir.
All right.
