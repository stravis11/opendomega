TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good afternoon everybody. Appreciate your patience. Before we get started, I wanted to share a couple of numbers with you. I thought it might be of interest. It was to me.
There's somewhere north of 167 bills in rules right now. And by tomorrow, I suspect after a committee meeting, it'll be closer to 180.
So I guess I'm telling you that to tell you that we're probably just not going to get to everything
We'll do the best we can
so
We've got a couple bills. We want to consider today
House bill 268 which is a rules substitute
To rule to house bill 268. It's LC
49
2328 s and chairman Irwin is going to explain that for us
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members, just to look at the change for you here, by the
way, we're getting quite good at changes.
Really what this change is, it generates reports of de-identifiable S3 records desegregated
by grade age, race, sex, ethnicity, language, learning status, and direct certification of
income status.
That was the change that we included in the bill, and that it would be the substitute,
Mr. Chairman.
Okay. You all should have a copy of that LC492328S. Do you have any questions for the author?
Have a couple of questions, Mr. Evans.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Has this been presented in rules before it got sent back?
You hear the question.
Where's it air to go?
I just can't remember.
I apologize.
Have we heard this bill here yet?
The session in rules?
In rules?
Yes.
No.
I have not.
It's a 60-something page.
It's obviously not chapter and verse.
but generally speaking, does it do any?
Could you give us a little bit of an idea of what it does?
Basically, what you're looking at here is a school safety bill.
Throughout the pages, it begins with mental health
and supply and school systems with a number of mental health
based on their school population size coordinators.
And those coordinators are going to come in to connect services
for children that are in crisis.
Another ability this bill provides is linking together our response agencies and our educational
systems so that we can communicate about children.
We also develop a BTAM team, which is a threat assessment team that is able to be at each
school to look and have tiered threat assessments so we can respond to those threat assessments.
So it is coordinating all those agencies not only by communication but building teams,
building plans, trying to secure the environments within the school and giving us the ability
to be preventative by working with the mental health of the students that are in crisis
and getting them to the services they need before they transition into a desire to hurt themselves
or hurt somebody. So that encompasses the biggest part of the bill.
They have another question, Lou Hewley.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. That was my concern and I didn't think we had heard this in rules.
speaking to the mental health coordinators, are they based on some type of
Roy show of students or what is the basis for them? Great question. We did that
based on we started with 18,000 students unless get one coordinator for that
system and then there's another tiered system from 18 to and I would need to look
back through, I believe it was into the 30,000's get two and above 30 something
thousand will get three of the mental health coordinators. You know this is a
very important part of this bill I will tell you so that we can work with
these students as I said to keep them from transitioning into violence or
hurting themselves. So those coordinators will then be able to work with
systems and train the teachers, train administrators to know how to look for these students that are in crisis and then how to connect them to those services.
One other question if I may, Mr. Chair. So these middle half coordinators, they are a level on top of school counselors. Is that what we're looking at?
I won't say on top of school counselors, we have counselors today in schools called guidance counselors and then there for guidance
We are now supplying a
Person or a position in there that is going to be dedicated to the behavioral help of a child
It's a more of that mental end and that mental end in training. I can see school systems
Putting the same counselors in the counseling office with a different focus on how to assist the kids rather than guide the kids
through their education program.
Okay, you don't see any other questions.
I'll entertain a motion to do pass.
Have a motion and second to do pass.
Any other discussion? Any opposition?
It passes out.
Thanks, sir. Thank you.
Okay, we have another bill.
House bill 651.
Have a room substitute to that chairman Powell.
It's LC 39, 47, 29, yes.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
You know, this is an interesting piece of legislation
that deals with these school zone cameras.
And I then asked to produce a product
that would be workable in fire
because it looks issues involved in it and the contention.
But if you look at this bill, start on section two,
this starts with a signage, and we're moving from just
the flashing signs to flashing sign with a speed detector
on that sign, which would depict the speed of the vehicle
as they're entering a school zone.
So these are signs that would tell that person
driving the vehicle that they may be exceeding the speed limit. Section 4, this
deals with the muddable presumption. This deals with 35% rule. This has been
recently added in the last hour or so at the request of some of the members.
This is that rule that we had did on radar and speed traps a few years ago.
It said that the local governments, if they raise more than 35 percent of their working
capital off of these types of devices, then they're going to penalize.
Section 5 is something that I really considered that was put aside by the other laws of the
state.
This is a 10 mile an hour over, through the state of Georgia.
We've always said that the only people who can give you a citation as a Georgia State
control unless you're with exact speeding violation. This gives you 9 miles an hour. So you
basically have to be 10 miles an hour over. So in those school zones where it says 20 is actually
going to be 30 miles per hour. That adds a 10 mile an hour to that. So it puts everything
uniform statewide on that. It's a top of page 5. A and B gives a definitive hour, a definitive
time these cameras can be used two hours in a morning to an afternoon, an hour before
school starts and an hour after they take in and say for the afternoon, an hour before
an hour after, very specific. On line 101, this deals with four lanes. There have been
some questions asked about some jurisdictions running these on the four lanes. This puts
is under DOT approval to define the four lanes, if that's so.
You get down to page line 111.
The citations would be $75 for the first violation
and $125 for the second.
And it strikes the $25 admin fee that is current law.
Page 6.
If you look at that language, this is an attention to the, to the, you know, when it gets a citation, it defines the legitimate agency that sending it just basically says they have to send it in the envelope, first class envelope, which prominently displays the name and the seal in the local governing body.
It is issued in that citation.
Type of Phase 7 on line 145.
This is a notice of rights to say that you have in large letters.
It says you have right contest liability by contacting your local court.
And then you get the page and I and somewhere around
two twelve and it carries over into about two thirty-six. This is a section that
is somewhat was put in. It said that if you get a citation and for whatever
reason you don't pay it or it's still out there, then it would be reported to
the Department of Revenue that it would stick to your title, your car, and you
couldn't sell that car. We struck that language. So we've now done away with that
part of the current law and then I think most importantly what we've done is
if you look starting on line 241 this gives a description of school safety
purposes and what we've done is we have cut the money in half that 50% of the
fines would be retained by the local jurisdiction to pay for the
administration and whatever they want to do with that but the other 50% would be
given to the local school systems in that jurisdiction.
So the ceases to become a, there's a lot of people said, a revenue driven device, local
governments.
And that Mr. Chairman and speakers, that's what, members, that's what it does, they glad
to stumble through any questions you might have.
Okay, I've got a couple of questions for you.
Chairman Stevens has a question.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I'm just looking through the bill since I've just seen it show me in the bill where it whenever you have a clear defective camera that there's a provision in here that requires them to remove it and replace one that's working.
Well, I do not know where that would be unless it's under the current code which I don't think it is.
That's up to the local jurisdictions about clean the cameras and such as that I mean, it's got a quickly show
That that's your tag number's got to read it
And also they'd remembered it in the original current law and the original law
The local jurisdictions the local law enforcement agencies. They're supposed to review these tickets
Now, I don't know how many of Max's do that
I know that we've all heard the stories
that people's had to vehicle on the back of a tow truck and they picked up the tag and
I was sure that law enforcement officer, that's true the law enforcement officer would
have could have taken a scene that so that's still up to the local law and if they don't
have a clean camera or the lens of the camera where they can't show anything and you can
always just another right to contest it in the court if you want to do that.
in a follow-up.
Just one more, that situation where enough got enough retired administrator of the school
system, which a boy to school drops 30 minutes out of the way, we've got a two-lane highway.
She's looking at four tickets on her table where she does 17 miles per hour.
The camera picks up her car along with the speeding car beside her and sends her a ticket.
is not unusual. Okay, Jim Lenson. Yes, just wondering if you could direct me. One of the main
complaints that we've had is camera running all day long. Is there specific language
I'm looking at? I just want to make sure I'm interpreting it correctly, 91 and 92. That
Just limits it to two hours in the morning around the time that they arrive in two hours in the afternoon at the time
They depart. It's not running all day long. Is that my understanding of what this is exactly right? This clearly defines at the time. No time during the day. None of this at night time events or
Athletics after hours. This is two hours of the morning two hours in the afternoon around the time the school takes in and lets out. Follow up in
And the lights have to be activated or operating at the time during these time periods.
That is so, and that's the law right now.
Well, when it's running all day long, that's not the case, so that's okay.
Only while the lights are flashing lights are out there.
I think the digeristicians will probably, when they see this bill, it's going to probably
get their attention a little bit more diligent about how they're using these devices.
All right.
Thank you.
Literally.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
To the author of the bill, how did you all come up with this 5050 arrangement and are
there restrictions on what each party of this 5050 arrangement can spend their money
on?
We looked at some of the numbers. It had been reported and there was an extravagant amount of money
It was being raised off of these by a lot of small jurisdictions
And you know the old adage around here, whether you believe it or not follow the money
Because always part of the rule that creates a lot of a lot of issues
The good intended things and by cutting half of that money
instead of the jurisdiction getting
65, 70, 75% of the money, they'll get 50%, but what they'll have to do in that 50%
they're also going to have to pay for the cameras around them or buy themselves or subscribe
to them or whatever they do with these things.
So that's going to probably take a size for a mile of the money that goes to those local
governments.
basically drive them back into the realm that these are supposed to be tools for safety and
skills.
Rep.
Hope you have a question.
I do.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Powell.
I'm curious as to the legislative intent of the phrasing demonstration of prior history
in line 102.
Do you mean demonstrated history of speeding during school hours, demonstrated history of accidents?
What's what is it that you're driving out there? What's your line number 102?
There's a clause that says for the four lanes. It says to have a camera
My understanding is which may go back through with a question from Chairman Stavins about four lanes
But my understanding is that this is a term that DOT would use the approval about where what lanes or what they can run them on
It was like radar and that would do with four lanes.
If a school was on a four-lane, they might not have purpose to have it.
It would be a restriction to them to run in these on a four-lane road.
I think my question, if I could do a quick follow-up, is what would we expect people to show
through that demonstration of prior history in order to satisfy that?
I think the word is a prior history is what DOT would, how they would make their rules
on these four on these of highways more than a two-lane.
They would look at the, I guess they would look at whatever the traffic and safety standards
and all that and what these would need it on four-lane roads.
Okay, thank you.
Okay, Chair Lee, Taylor, do you have a question?
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
to the author. I do have a couple questions. I have one of the schools that is two lanes one way, two lanes the other way.
We have a football stadium there, tennis courts, and will those apply throughout the day? I thought I had read before that when you have it with different sides of the highway, it would apply all day.
I didn't see that in this bill, you know.
Very specifically, this classifies this.
It's two hours in the morning, two hours in the afternoon.
I don't think it gets any more clear than that.
And then the language that the previous representative
had asked that the DOT would have control over deciding these four lives.
Could I follow up?
There's no indication about how much money is actually going
to the company that they are leasing these systems from. So if it's a $75 fine, some portion
of it will first go to that company and then the rest of it will be split 50-50.
I understand that there's four companies that either provide lease or whatever proper
time is. I've even heard that some of these jurisdictions are looking at buying their own
cameras, which is quite a scary thought, mate, but the 50% rule, 50% of $125 is $67.50.
That means that that local jurisdiction would have to negotiate with a company if they
want to be the company to send out the warnings they could do.
If they want to put up their own signs, I mean, this is just the dollar bills around what
what it has operates, so that it comes down to who they want to negotiate, they can negotiate.
Are they can buy their own cameras?
Thank you.
Jim Leaves.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman, thank you so much for your hard work on this bill.
We've got to get guardrails when you're doing a great job of kind of leading the effort.
But on the line of 145 and 146, it says that whomever is getting the citation would
include the language you have a right to contest liability by contacting your local court.
I know that some people, between people traveling through our state get these love notices
and people, such as we, from all over Georgia, and we get one in South Georgia, and we
talking about the local court where I live and my car is titled or we talking about the local
court where the incident happened. I'm sure that remains the local court where the incident happened.
My understanding is that a lot of people here could test these together with local courts.
I understand that a lot of them are just immediately tossed out.
Further question, if it could be our local court that I wouldn't have to go all the way down to
the McIntyre County is beautiful, is that county is,
and people have some kind of process of appeal
to my local magic court that would be nice.
Thank you for the bill.
Okay, Chairman Martin, do you have a question?
Yes, sir, if gentlemen, on lines 25 through 27 of the bill,
when you're redefining skills on an existing master state
order or local ordinance, if those two are in conflict,
Which would it be the most restrictive or would one prevail?
My understanding from legislative council, the master state order would be the DOT or whoever is setting
that schools on or the local ordinance.
And I would suspect that it would be the locals that would have that prerogative to establish
their schools on.
If you look down through the bill, it says, really specifically where they have to put these signage up flashing signs and all of that
Brief offices, so if this passes there would be
We'll get that state will
Form one in order for it to give the locals time to update there
Because when this comes effective they'll then have to hold
Earrings to set that ordinance, so that would be how that would work
the state will have one prepared so that we just all said we'll not have school zones anymore for a while though right you know there's not on state highway I think the locals would establish that the boundaries of the schools on what I think and this master state all over the state highway.
Thank you Mr. Chairman, Chairman Powell reminded me of something the moment ago that some members
have a question about some of these cameras and run by some cities especially do registration
tickets.
And this bill does it clarify that they cannot do anything but speed?
My understanding that's the current law that's all they've ever been able to do is to speed them.
Remember, this is a civil. If they use a counter, that's a civil counter. It's not a credit citation for sale.
Well, I wish this moves through. If you could make, let's try to find a line in here that moves through that clarifies it.
You know, use it for anything but to speed.
Well, you know, this bill, if this bill passes the house by this body, there will also be a second bill to be a consideration I understand.
Last year, I would be remiss if I didn't remind the members that last year the chairman of the public safety represented Collins.
passed a couple of these bills over and they got basically stymied over in the city.
They had no appetite for it.
I understand through a rumor and this is only rumor that they had no appetite to ban these cameras.
So this would be if these two bills do come up today,
and if this body passes both bills and they both go over to really give the senator something to think about.
Okay, if you have any Cooper, do you have a question?
I do think Mr. Chairman, what do you mean nothing else?
That they can't be charged...
I mean, what if they're drunk driving or, you know,
are you saying that they can't be charged with it or I'm misunderstanding?
Nothing else. These schools on campus can only be used
to detect speeders and the schools on.
Okay. There's no other, there's no other citations
in this as a civil citation.
Well, okay, they couldn't offer citation, but if the police men saw them doing it
This has this does not stop a police officer if a police officer sees a
Driver is violating some other law or even the speeding law. Okay. Thank you. I didn't stop them from having a police officer
Okay, okay, you don't see any other questions
Do I hear a motion and a motion passed in a second in the opposition?
I tell you this, these two chairman have worked very hard on these two pieces of legislation.
They have tried to take a lot of input.
I know from various folks who have come to them, you know, I think I'm Chairman Erwin and
Chairman Powell for your hard work on these two pieces of legislation.
