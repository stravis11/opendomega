Thank you for joining us here today on Wednesday, January 24, 2024 in the year of our Lord.
Anodominant.
It's for our E-latin speakers.
Primer Sadies.
You probably speak Latin too, don't you?
Whatever you do.
You do now.
A little bit.
Yeah.
You speak Latin now.
I just dubbed it.
Okay.
I tell you what, let's start off with a prayer today.
He looks like a good prayer in man or woman.
Madam Leader, you want to leave some prayer today?
Oh, center house teller, ladies and prayer please.
Let us all pray.
Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for this day that you've given us.
We know you have been good to us in so many ways and we ask for your wisdom and you're
leading us to the past that we should be on and all that we do that we could honor you today.
We thank you for all that you provided and asked that you could continue to provide us with the ability to do the best we can.
We ask this in your name. Amen.
Thank you for that, Chairman.
All right, first on the docket, we've got SB 348 Senator Williams.
Is he here? Rick Williams?
Not here
All right, so dollars all we're
All right, so nobody's bills gonna get picked if you're not here. So they're out of a S. R. One five eight
Same bill presented yesterday this basically just designated it was just X corridor in West Northwest Georgia
Any questions
All right, we've got S-R-4-4-3, Senator Kennedy.
You'll cover that one.
Yes, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, everybody.
This is the appointment for Rick Jeffries to the state election board.
I spoke to this the other day. Most everyone probably in the room.
Not just those of us on the committee. No Rick. He's a good businessman.
a good person served in the Senate for a number of years and it is the choice of
recommendation that he serve on the state election board. Any questions? If you
all aren't talking about Rick Jeffries then I'm gonna need you to stop. Okay. I
figured you were. I'm just gonna make sure. All right good job. All right. Senator
Dolezal, you want to cover SB 353?
Thank you, Mr. Evans.
Well, G. Department Bill, we actually passed this bill.
About 95% of the form that it is currently in last year
is vetoed due to a change that we actually
may on the Senate floor, and that's been cleaned up
and passed out of committee unanimously.
Any questions?
Okay.
We're hoping to wait for Senator or representative Carson,
don't you snuck in on me all right well once you come up to the podium for some
cover HB 30 absolutely we were patiently awaiting your arrival I know you were
I apologize for my delay you beat us actually I had blooms were going to be
coming out of the ceiling, but is that right before we get them prepared?
Very good. Yes, chairman members of the committee, this is House Bill 30, the
anti-semitism bill to provide and to title 50 for the first time a definition for
anti-semitism to help us identify it for the purposes of judges and
prosecutors to determine not for any violation of first amendment rights but in
regard to the criminal or discriminatory intent against our friends in the
Jewish community. This is a I would argue a much needed bill two years ago in
last year but especially in light of recent events both national and local.
and that's all it does is provide a definition of any
stigmatism into the Georgia code any questions from the
committee all right good job thank you sir
