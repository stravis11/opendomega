Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the lady from the 45th House District, representative Sharon Cooper. Representative Cooper. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to bring the pastor of the day on this final, I need a day, a signy die. And before I introduce Reverend Dr. Jessica Tarell, I'd like to also ask the House to help me welcome Reverend Porter. He's a chaplain at the first Methodist Church in Smirna, Georgia, Reverend Porter. Thank you. I'm so glad Reverend Porter came along with Reverend Dr. Jessica Tarell because, Tarell, because it was a toss-up about which one to ask today. And if you listen carefully as a little bit more in the introduction, you'll understand why I decided to ask her. And Dr. Porter was very nice, still greets you along with that. So Reverend Jessica is from one of the greats, Georgia. And like many in this chamber, she grew up in a farm that had been in her family for generations. And in a community that was small at the time and on a farm, you learn a lot about people and being involved in your community and learning to help with the needs of others and going back and forth and helping each other when there's a time of need. And she did learn that. And it did direct her in life into the ministry. She's a Georgian. She went to Lagrange College. And then went away for a little while up to Duke but came back to get her doctorate in divinity from Emory. The real kicker for me today, since this is the last day, that in 2011, she exchanged pulpits with a church in Northern Ireland in Belfast. And she became a person who studied and practiced, you know, conflict resolution and reconciliation. Don't get to do a little bit of that, do you, speaker? Not just a little bit. And in this day, in this very stressful last day of session, as often we get very tense and tempers get a little out of control, maybe she'll stick around in case somebody needs some personal counseling. So she enjoys a lot of outdoor activities that we have in Georgia like kayaking and hiking. But she also enjoys traveling out of our state, but always enjoys coming back at home to Georgia. She has been the senior pastor in many churches, but right now she is a district superintendent for the area in which I live. And if you've paid any attention to what's been going on with the Methodist Church in the area in which I live, you will understand why it's so important that we have somebody that is good and compromised and reconciliation because our churches and Methodist churches in Ireland have been torn apart. And she is helping us put them back together again. So with that, I give you Dr. Terrell. Thank you very much for coming today. Thank you so much for that introduction. And also for the honor of offering you all a word of encouragement and guidance as you lead and care for the people of our beloved state. As a resident of Cobb County and a lifetime Georgian, I appreciate, appreciate your service on behalf of us all. But I'd like to begin our time this morning with a few questions. So I hope you'll indulge me. How many of you play Whartle? That five letter word game that comes out daily from the New York Times? I play Whartle just about every day. Now here's another question. Do any of you like me have a word or two that you always guess first with? Anybody? Okay, a few hands, yeah? That's a rough question. Now if any of you played the Sunday puzzle, I'm wondering if any of you got it correctly. It was kind of an odd word. Anybody remember what it was? Close. The word was Towel. T-O-W-E-L. Towel is a simple word used to describe something that we use daily. But rarely give much attention to in our lives. There are bath towels and hand towels, paper towels. We use towels to wrap ourselves or our babies in after a bath. We use them to clean dinner tables or lunch counters or to dry things. And truth be told, had Towel been the word or word any other day and may have given it very little thought. Even though I originally come from Troop County where towels were manufactured for decades and the local mills. But because Sunday was Palm Sunday, the beginning of the Holy Week where Christians remember Christ final days of his earthly ministry, I paid attention to this word. For a towel is actually featured in one of these Holy Week stories, the one for today.

Today is Monday Thursday. The day when Jesus and His disciples met for a final dinner in an upper room. It was the day when Jesus took bread and wine and gave us the sacrament of Holy Communion. It was a day when Jesus announced that some would betray Him. And it was also the day when Jesus wrapped a towel around His waist, humbly knelt before His friends and took upon Himself the role of a servant, washing and drying their dusty, tired feet. Now after He had washed their feet, Jesus stood up again with the towel, a symbol of a servant still around His waist. And He told His disciples that He was giving them a new commandment, a new set of instructions that they should love others the way He loved them, that they should care for all and serve all people. This is what the word Monde means to command. And on that first Monday Thursday His disciples were commanded to put the needs and hopes of others before their own wants and desires and take on the posture of service. My friends, you were elected by the people of Georgia to put the needs and hopes of others before your own interest every day. You were elected to make decisions that benefit all people and not just to select few. This is not an easy task, but it is a profound responsibility. It is the kind of responsibility that the Apostle Paul says in the book of Colossians, it requires you to clothe yourselves with compassion and kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience every day as you bear with people. So bear with me a moment longer. Whatever your faith is, I hope that on this Monday Thursday, on this last day here, you might look at the example of Jesus and think of the good you can accomplish by having a heart that stops to care and serve. I would like to pray for you, and so if you join me in standing for that prayer. Gracious and just God, you are the one who hears all prayers and knows every need. Be with the leaders within this house today. Bless them and guide them as they do the work they were elected to do. May they clothe and conduct themselves with compassion and patience, gentleness, humility, and kindness. May all that they decide and do be done with great love for and in service to others. Let what they accomplish bear much fruit within Georgia. Help them, O Lord, to be good neighbors to all, and an answer to the prayers of the people they represent. For we ask this prayer in the name of Jesus, the one who taught us and showed us what it means to truly love and serve others. And all of God's people said together. Amen. Now if you are a main standing and join with me in the pledge of allegiance. I pledge allegiance to the lie of the nine states of America and to the republic for which it stands. My nation and the honor of God, the indisputable liberty and justice for all. Thank you, Fred. I'm sorry. Thank you. Thank you. Dr. Terrell, we appreciate that devotion. It helps us get our day started on the right way. In the central, north Georgia district, central west district is blessed to have you and continue good luck in your work as well. Doorkeepers, you may unlock the doors. Members, you may join Dr. Terrell in the south any room. Thank you for being here today and have a photo with her if you like. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Members, our doctor of the day is today is brought to us by Representative Mary Margaret Oliver. Thank you, Representative Oliver. Dr. Daniel Lopez is here to take care of our needs today. And if you have an opportunity to make sure you show your appreciation of Dr. Lopez, Representative Oliver, I hope you'll let him know that we'll appreciate him being here. Chairman Tarvan, the chair of the Committee on Information and Audits has recognized. Chairman Tarvan. Mr. Speaker, your committee on Information and Audits has read the journal from the previous legislative day and found it to be correct. And if you're willing to do this, I want to say how much I've appreciated giving these quotes every morning and the report. And it's been a great honor for me. I had about 10 people want to give this final quote today. But some of them were quite frightening. And if I'm frightened, it must have been really bad. But on a lighter note, I ordered a hen, a chicken, and an egg. I ordered a chicken and an egg from Amazon. And I will tell you later. I did it. It took me a minute. Words of wisdom. We appreciate your words of wisdom during the session these 40 days. In spite of your assistance, assistance back there. They've been spot on. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Get a photo over here, if you will. Be great. Thank you. That completes our morning orders. We'll move on to the rules calendar. We'll move on to the rules calendar. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate Bill 198. Senate Bill 198 by Senator Harold the 40th, Albers, the 56 Butler, the 55th and others, being titled an act to amend Chapter 137 of the Fisher go to Georgia annotated relating to governing and regulation and mental health. So it's great to Georgia's with intellectual and developmental disabilities, innovation commission. Ms. Bill, I refer to the committee on public health. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by rules committee substitute. Members, if you'll give your attention to the presenter, I think you'll need to hear what he has to say. Chairman Hawkins is recognized to present Senate Bill 198. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You know, I think we've all heard from our hometown pharmacist, the folks that we go to church with, the folks that coach our kids and little league baseball and soccer, some of them are counseling. There's been a mayor up in one of the northern towns. Georgia probably about 20 years. We got two of our distinguished house members over here on my left that are pharmacists. And right now those independent pharmacists are struggling to survive and keep the doors open. It's come to our attention that the state PBM has decided that they will pay them less than they do the change stores and the middle size doors. We've been looking into this for some time. And I will tell you, it's funny how it works. It sort of worked this way years ago in the health care. They would take about four to 500 of the procedures that we can do and pick out the ones that we do every day and cut those by 30%. But when you look across the sphere of four or 500 procedures, it came out the less than 1%. But what you do every day gets cut 30%. You don't have an income. All you're doing is paying the overhead. And that's what's happening to our pharmacist. And that is not right. So this piece of legislation, you don't have the opportunity to say to folks, we're going to be there for you. You can go home and point to something that you did hope your hometown pharmacist. We're very lucky to have a great group of legislators who listen intently. Know the subject matter and can make a difference at home. We've got a guy behind me and a staff that helps us go forward and we produce some really good legislation. Stuff that we can be proud of. We may argue about some things, but we go home and we've done a good job. Sort of like what the guy said about politics is like riding the horse. If it feels good, you ain't doing it right. So a lot of times we're doing it right because it doesn't always feel good. But this one's going to feel good. This bill right here will pay an average to all pharmacies, the same average. So everybody's going to be equal. The way it should be through all our lives in this great state, this great nation. I will ask you to vote for this measure. If there are no questions, Mr. Speaker, you have a question to your left. Reptile now is recognized for a question. OK. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. That's gentleman Yale. I do. Is it not true that I came to your desk and mentioned heart's pharmacy that has been in our county for over 50 years is a small pharmacy? I believe that to be true. Well, on behalf of him, I want to just say thank you. Well, thank you. Well, thank you for your vote. Representative Reiss, you have a quota. This is starting to be your first one. Representative Reiss is recognized. I'm kidding. Is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. That's gentleman Yale. Hey, guys. Sir, isn't it true that this bill here will help many of our small pharmacies, especially in the rural area, get the reimbursement that they need? And hopefully we will see pharmaceutical facilities maintained at businesses in small towns versus losing them based upon the contracts that we've seen historically. Absolutely. Not only today, tomorrow, but also into the future. That was a good question. So we're going to try a guy from rural Georgia. If you'll take one more question. Yes, sir. Coach here, the rural development council, the dean of this house, Representative Gerald Green. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman Yale? He does to his friend. And we are friends. And we've discussed this, particularly, issue so much. And you know in the rural areas what is happening. And one of the initiatives of the rural development council was just this, to try to find a way. And you have found a way. And I commend you for this piece of legislation. And I encourage all of my individuals in this house to both this particular piece of legislation. Thank you for doing this. Well, thank you. And I want to reiterate, Representative Stevens has walked every step with this day and night. We've been in the governor's office, the DCH office. We've been everywhere we can go to find a path for this to work. And you may see more things coming in the future to help these folks. This is only a first step. Yeah. Gentlemen, I ask no further questions. Thank you, sir. Gentlemen, as you ordered the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? They share his none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to withdrawing the committee substitute? Chair, here's none. The committee substitute is withdrawn. Is there any objection to adopting the substitute ordered by the committee on rules? Chair, here's none. The rules committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to report the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. The committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? I do. Um, a couple of steps forward and could surely come slightly down. Yes, and by which one have any objection to disagree with others in your position asard? Sure, and by which passing out. And by which turn please continue to have some lecture on multiply paragraph. Form, align, that section. они WH KRISTEN KESSINO That section called inflow?​ Siiauno Chania has either passed away about six to five minutes or three to five, in this direction in the office.

Mr. Bill I refer to the committee on education that committee recommends this bill do pass by rules committee substitute. Give Hilton is recognized to present the bill representing Scott Hilton. Thank you Mr. Speaker members of this body I am honored to present to you Senate bill 351. As the father of three young children 1715 and 12 our family takes a very active role in their participation online and this bill addresses that in several components and so I'll walk you through the bill just briefly. The meat of the bill starts on section 2.2 which requires the Department of Education to publish on its website one or more model programs that teach students in grade 6 through 12 the impact of social media on mental health and how social media can manipulate influences thoughts and behaviors. We had a young student not far from my district in John's Creek by the name of Nathan come and testify and he aptly used a song from the 80s every rose has a thorn and that social media in this generation it's great for connectivity activism but it has its thorns and it's reared its ugly head and mental health and the impact in our children. In 2.2.3 of the bill we pick up with chairman Irwin's house bill 3.38 which passed this house unanimously that requires schools to adopt technology on school issue devices that blocks and filters obscene content again on school issue devices. In 2.4 further that method it requires on devices that social media not be accessed on school on devices. You move then move to section 2.5 of the bill where we make our first meaningful updates to bullying especially in regards to cyber bullying and outlaw and outlines recommendations there. In 3.1 of the bill requires that social media companies make commercially reasonable efforts to make technology available for age verification for minors. For a minor seeking to sign up for a social media account their parents will need to submit some sort of verification letting them know that they agree to their minor child signing up for that social media account. I'll tell you down here in the house many of the problems we try to solve are really due to parental involvement and this is a great build encourage for involvement in the realm of social media. And then finally in section 3.2 we pick up house bill 910 which was passed by chairman jaspers by vote of 165 to 1 again requiring age verification for websites that offer obscene material. With that Mr. Speaker I will pause for questions. You have a couple of questions to your left represent Parsons is recognized for a question. Thank you speaker. Jim and yield. Yes sir. Yes sir thank you for working on this. I am aware some legislation has passed in other states that are tied up in court now regarding something like this. I'm just curious in this legislation I could have looked and read it and I apologize. But what are the ages defined for minor children in this bill? Great. Yes sir. Gentlemen we will suspend just for a moment. Great question. Yes sir have been litigation. We took that in consideration when writing this bill. In this bill a minors are defined as 16 and under the age of 16. So Florida just passed a bill there's was 14 and under. Yep. Reps in the heagley to your left also has a question represent heagley's recognized for question. Thank you Mr. Speaker does the gentleman yield to my seat made I don't know if I have a choice. So yes I do thank you. First of all how many subject matters do we have in this bill? We have a couple bills that have come along but they're all within the same realm of technology and education. Okay. So does the gentleman further yield? Yes ma'am. So in the age 25 of the bill what does it explain to me in the last 635 where it starts what is commercially reasonable efforts to verify age what does that actually mean? I take it on kind of plain language there they've got to make reasonable efforts and we we've outlined those in the bill what some of those efforts are so they've got to a parent can submit online submit via facts call in again the bill outlines a number of ways that parents can easily submit an age verification for their child. That's a different one final question. Yes please. So how will all of this be enforced? So a lot of this falls under the attorney general online 675 kind of starting there we'll have the authority over enforcement. Thank you. Yeah. Gentlemen yield for Chairman Jasper's for a question. Do you alright? Thank you. I think Representative Hilton do you yield for a bridge? Yes I do. Yes ma'am. Isn't it true that's when the House voted 165 to 1 on House Bill 910 that will protect our children that the New Orleans based US district court ruled in favor of the language that's in this bill and that very day poor and hub turned Texas off. You are you know what it was you speak and you have a couple more if you take them I will yield for one more. You know representing Irwin is dealt with young people his whole life let's see what he has to ask. Gentlemen recognize for a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker does gentleman yield. Yes ma'am. Yes ma'am. First of all representative does this bill ensure that only great appropriate material was able to be viewed on the state owned handheld devices that we handed the children such as Chromebooks today. Yes it does. I just want to commend you on your work on this legislation I know you've put years into it and again it's about protecting our children and making sure they see only material that is age appropriate that they should be seeing on devices. Perfect. Thank you very much. Thank you Mr. Chairman. With that Mr. Speaker I'd encourage this body to vote for this legislation to protect our children and what they're viewing online and with that I will yield the well. Thank you. The gentleman is yielded the well. We have a member signed up to speak in opposition. Representative David Wilkerson is recognized to speak to the bill. Representative Wilkerson. You have the gentleman to well your attention please. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I was actually going to ask some questions about the bill because in committee we had a few concerns and normally in committee we can kind of work on a bill realizing his intent is to protect children but I'm just going to highlight some of the questions that I have and why I think this is a bill that I'm going to be voting against because I think it needs some more work. If you go to section 2.1 line 48 we talk about K through 12 K through 12 and then we even add in on lines 59 local governing board shall implement in all grade levels a program. If you go to line 75 we don't start until fifth and sixth grade when they do a model program. So how do you implement a program for K through 12 but you don't have a model program until fifth grade. The author the senator believed that kids don't use the internet before sixth grade so that's why you didn't want to do anything. So that's my first issue. The second issue deals with the definitions of social media. I know schools throughout the state right now use YouTube and I am still looking for the carve out as social media is defined on lines 565 as all the social media is anything that allows content to be uploaded and commented on IE YouTube except for these carve outs. What this will mean that is in a lot of schools as people travel the world through YouTube videos to educate their children that will now be forbidden under this bill. So we're going to be handicapping the teachers unless someone can point out to me where that carve out is for YouTube it's another concern that I have. My kids went through public school and I know that we already have social media policies and I'm trying to think of what this bill is trying to accomplish. I understand you know what are the penalties if they don't comply strictly by this. What are the companies they have to be used to filter this.

So I know what I'm doing. I'm not, I'm encouraging folks to vote no, but I understand if you want to vote yes, but I do have a lot of concerns, and I do know that whatever we do, if we do pass this, we'll be back fixing it next year. I can tell you that right now, because there's too many issues with this bill, and with that I will be voting no on Senate Bill 351 and I yield the well. The gentleman has yielded the well. That concludes the presentations on SB 351. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none of the previous questions ordered. Is there any objection to withdrawing the committee's substitute? Chair, here's none of the committee's substitute is withdrawn.

What purpose is represented? Lisa Campbell-Rise. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Parliamentary inquiry. State inquiry. Isn't it true while I support the measures of this bill that were harmful to students? I also agree that the language in this bill is so extremely broad that it will also potentially, as has been previously mentioned, suppress and limit many positive uses of technology for students to gather and to discuss things remotely across the state and around the world, including conferencing, as well as limiting many news gathering information and sources. I'm sure the lady believes exactly what she just said is true. All members voted if so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of Senate Bill 351, the yeas are 120 and the nays are 45. This bill, having received a requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, you read the caption to Senate Bill 105105.

This bill ever referred to the Committee on Public Safety and Homeland Security, that committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. Representative Mathis has recognized to present the bill. Representative Mathis. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House. This bill is the corner bill. This is one that we make them full-time employees. This is a schedule based on population for salaries. We've made a few changes. We made it to where the Deputy Corner, everything was taken out except it'd be raised from 175 to 250. The other changes are going to move the date for this to be implemented to January 1 of 2026 to give counties time to get research of their budgets. Mr. Speaker, that is the bill. I appreciate your favorable considerations. No questions are yielded well. No questions. General Masier to the well, Representative Holly. Representative Holly is recognized speaking favor of the bill. Representative Holly. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My colleagues, I join in requesting us a passage favorably for Senate Bill 138. Georgia has had a varied and sometimes so-called history of clearing up inaccuracies with relative to death, particularly we know this to be true. In our state's Jim Crow past, where even the equal justice and this to- It's found that over 531 cases of unsolved deaths occurred where there actually needed to be a more direct accounting for the cause of death. As we know that our counties are growing, certainly it is good to have a salary that is commensurate with the population growth. But I wanted to just bring to light the necessity of this because it's not simply about making sure that we pay our corners what they're worth. But we also know too that aside from having any grand jury investigations, corners are responsible for having their own jurors to be able to look over a case to determine the exact cause of death. And we know that if Georgia is to remain free from the constraints of our past, then we should afford the corners with the full opportunity to be able to examine those deaths, to be able to have a juror. And one can only do their job correctly when we can dignify their role by paying them what they're worth. So my colleagues, while we can look at some of the language, particularly those relative to those salaries, I'm seeing that there's a need in order to prepare them for the work, we know that we must also do this just for the sake of guaranteeing that we can satisfy the demands of justice. That oftentimes, if you don't have enough information there for those who have been exacted to the pains of society and is yet to see them fully as human, it requires us to make sure that we are paying those who would have a legal eye to be able to perform their duties necessary so that we can have justice. So yes, colleagues, I do wish that you will join me in supporting Senate Bill 138 with that. I'll leave the well. Gentlemen, as you do the well, that concludes our speakers on Senate Bill 138. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is any objection to adopting the Committee's substitute? Chair, here's none.

Yes, Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not true, Mr. Speaker, that I've been in the funeral industry for 17 years support Senate Bill 138 because I know the important work that corners and deputy corners do to help families in their most vulnerable time of need. Is that not true, Mr. Speaker? That is very true. And my apologies to you for when you stood up, you usually are a little bit up. I can hear you very well. Most times, I didn't hear you then. I'm sure the lady knows of what she speaks. You project very well. All members voted if so, the clerk will unlock the machine. All in the past, if Senate Bill 138, the yeas are 169, the nays 1.

That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chairman Tyler Paul Smith has recognized to present the bill. Representative Smith. Thank you, miss Speaker. Good morning, members of this office. I'm sorry, we just wanted to bring this great piece of legislation to you. That we had actually passed out of the house under House Bill 909. This is our first defender act, and if you'll recall that it was enacted in 68 to allow Georgia's second chance when they made an isolated mistake. This bill will help bring the first defender act into the 21st century by ensuring that our...

method of restricting access to records accounts for private background checks and the internet accomplishes the aims and goals of the First Defender Act overall. And so our current law does not account for the private or the way that private background checks work, which is to search a national database that has state records submitted to it. What is needed to protect these records from these private background checks is record ceiling, which current law does not guarantee. This bill would actually allow for the ceiling of a record to occur at sentencing. Of course I remind all the members that First Fender would not be applicable to seven days or DUI and a few other enumerated crimes and offenses in this state. Miss Speaker, that is in essence the bill. I appreciate the consideration this body and would yield for any questions. You have a couple of questions. Yes sir. Reptile the steps and the back of the room on your left has a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chairman Yeal. To my friend, the Strawberry, Watermelon, Best Peach, Ice Cream, Second Non-Chairman Dickie, I do. Thank you for that. Can you help me to understand how this bill actually will benefit someone from Taylor County for instance, someone who may have been arrested and their case was submitted to the grand jury and only the prosecution was able to submit to the grand jury and their case making on through and they are convicted. How was this bill actually impact someone that may have been arrested and this is their First Offence? Can you explain that to me to help me understand it better please? I will give you an example. And I can't hear you well. Yes, I will give you an example. So you have an individual in Taylor County that enters into a play of guilty for a felony or misdemeanor offense for that matter. They could request that the court grant them First Offender status. Okay, if they are given First Offender status depending on what the terms of that sentence are whether it involves prison time or just straight probation time or combination of both, if you do not currently request that the judge seal that record then that individual in Taylor County would have to come back at the completion of their sentence and request that the record be sealed. Further questions Mr. Yes ma'am. Representative. So how would a person who has been arrested, how would they know that they can they can ask for their record to be sealed like that? How would they know to do this? If they have got a lawyer worth their salt they would be informed of that. And lawyer worth their salt. Yes ma'am. Okay. Thank you. Thank you for your work on this legislation. Thank you. My doctor will let me use salt. So I am wondering about that. I am not sure if saltless. Representative Hagen has recognized for a question. Thank you. Does it General McNeill? To my friend who originally brought this house bill. Yes. I thank you so much for taking this on. And would you agree that in order for George's First Offender Act which was originally enacted in 1968 to be restored truly to his original intent which was to give people who make an isolated mistake a second chance at success in their life that this legislation is very important. I will hardedly agree 110 percent. Thank you. Would you further yield? I will further yield. And isn't it true that what this legislation does is basically bring our code up to speed with where technology is. It's everything is found online. We want to make sure we protect these people who are using the First Offender plea in these cases. Again, I fully agree 110 percent with that. It is much needed and timely correction to our statute. Thank you so much, Chairman. Thank you. Well, that, Mr. Speaker, I am going to yield the well and ask this body's favorable consideration. General McNeill, I want to thank both of you for your work on this. I think Hagen, Ripney Smith. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee substitute? Chair, here's none. The Committee substitute is adopted.

I just want to let the members know that remember we passed a bill before signing it, before crossover, that bill with your road naming is in the Senate. They added theirs to it. They'll do theirs today. So yours is still active. I didn't call it out. It's in the Senate. We're already done those. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you for that clarity.

Senate resolution 609 by Senator Gooch of the 51st. A resolution recognizing the Prince's trial leader and dedicating a roundabout in her memory. This resolution has been referred to the Committee on Transportation. That committee recommends that this resolution be adopted. Governor's floor leader, Representative Will Wade, is recognized to speak to the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I rise to present Senate resolution 609. This is a very important historical marker in my district. And many of you that have traveled between DeLonigan and Blair'sville. If you know the reference of R-Ranch or Stonepow Gap, there is an intersection in which it is believed in a legend that a Cherokee princess, Tralita, is her remains. There's also a lake in Union County that carries the same name. This is to continue to keep a state marker sign up and to continue that legend for future travelers to pay homage and to pay reference to Cherokee Nation. With that, I ask for your favourable consideration and I appreciate the opportunity to present this. Thank you, Speaker. I yield. Thank you, Representative. Thank you, Representative. As you will, Representative McClain has recognized to speak to the resolution. Members give the member in the will. Your attention, please. Representative McClain. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As many of you all know, I am from Oklahoma. I am also a citizen of Cherokee Nation. And when I did see the... Now you're ready. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Again, it's, y'all know, I am a citizen of Cherokee Nation. I'm a card-carrying member of Cherokee Nation. So when I did see that we were doing our honor of Princess Traetim, I had to make sure that I had to say something because I want y'all to know that that's what legend said about it. But legend said about it. She was so pretty. She was so good-looking and so gorgeous. And the problem was a lot of the suitors were trying to go out with her and she didn't want to leave. She didn't. She stayed there. And she was kidnapped by a brave. But anyway, I say all of that to say that it's one of those things that you all need to know the history. So what happened was when they took her from the spring, when she took her from the spring, you know, and when they thought the spring water was making a beautiful and pretty, she began to get ill. And she died. And when she died, they took her back to, and so this is why the rocks are there because what people did was they didn't want anybody to destroy, destroy or disturb her or to bother her body or to do anything what they wanted to do was to protect her. So as everybody came by, they would always put a stone on to make sure that she was protected. So I want to make sure that I'm here to support this bill. 100% the Cherokee Nation, I do appreciate you the author will bring in this bill because again, it is a history lesson. It is a heritage and I am very honored that the princess, Tralitha, will be very happy to see the roundabout in her name. So thank you, Ms. Speaker, and I do you the well.

With that, ask for your favorable consideration and I yield the well. You had no questions either. Good choice.

Representative Monteneghan is recognized to present the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the House. Colleagues, today I stand before you to introduce House Resolution 1066. The regime that is currently governing Iran for decades has jeopardized the very core of our democracy. Now the threat has escalated significantly and has moved closer to home. We are confronted with the ongoing danger that Iran presents globally in knowledge as a foremost state sponsor of terrorism. On January 28, 2024, in Iran, Bank and militia called the Islamic Resistance in Iraq using a Iranian regime fund of military technology flew an explosive drone into a United States military base in Jordan, killing three United States service members in looming 40 plus others. The service members who died were Georgians from Wakecross, Georgia, Savannah, Georgia, Carlton, Georgia. Today members, we grieve for these families and the loss that these communities have suffered. Iran draws a state sponsor of terrorism as well documented and widely recognized. The regime in Tehran has systematically engaged in these types of actions of financing, arming, and supporting terrorist groups across the Middle East and beyond. De-stabilizing regions and posing a direct threat to global peace and security. So today members, we condemn Iran as a number one state sponsor of terrorism for the US soldiers that we lost. That were Georgians. And with that Mr. Speaker, I will yield the well. The gentleman has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered that Chair, here's none of the previous questions ordered.

Have all members voted if so, the clerk will lock the machine. All in the adoption of the resolution, House resolution 1066, the yeas are 164, the nays are zero. This resolution having to see the requisite constitutional majority is therefore adopted. Members, a couple more actions and we're going to have that long-awaited lunch break. Representative Leveritt is recognized for a motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, the resolution of the House, I move that the House agree to the Senate amendment to Senate Bill 479 as amended by the House. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? Senate Bill 479, Senator Hatcher, the 50th upstatement, the 52nd burns, the 23rd and others to be entitled back to amend Article 14 of Chapter 1 and Title 10 of the EFJ of Georgia and Entity relating to secondary medical recyclers. Representative Leveritt is recognized to explain the Senate amendments and the House amendment. Representative Leveritt. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Judicial Pay Bill. Come back to us. As you may recall about a week ago, we stripped out a Senate Bill and sent our House Bill back to the Senate after the Senate appropriations committee did unspeakable things to our resolution and Senate Bill. So this is a Senate Bill 479. Immediately following this, I will hopefully be able to present House Resolution 1042. They're both sort of part of the judicial compensation package, but I want to talk about Senate Bill 479. So if you recall, just to review quickly, because I know our time is valuable today, this issue was studied by the legislature back in 2016. There was a committee of the Judicial Council that was set up in 2022 that studied judicial pay for a year issued a report last summer that was shared with the legislature and with appropriations committee during the fall and even during special session. That report reflected a compromise amongst all judges as to the manner of their pay. The main issue we were going after were two issues. One, the judges that we deal with here are the state paid judges. So we're talking about our pellet judges, spring court and court of appeals, the state wide business court and spear court. Those judges are state employees. There are a lot of other judges in our system like Magistrate Court Judges and Juvenile Court Judges and probate, but they're not state employees. So we're trying to deal with the state paid judges. So that's what our bill did and that's what the bill back before you does. But one of the issues is right now the state portion of that pay is 49th in the whole union. But there are supplements that many counties pay and some of those supplements are great and they put some judges where they're getting about the fifth highest pay in the country. Others are moved up to just number 45. They're trying to reform the structure of that pay so that the supplements play less of a role. This bill does not appropriate money. It does not set a salary for any judge. It is simply about the structure of the pay. The pay if it's to be changed still would have to be done through the appropriations process and I understand that's still an issue. We sent our bill over to the Senate back in February about 20 legislative days ago and we just got it back the previous legislative day. And there were some substantial changes. The changes to the judicial pay portion were not that great. They are agreeable in the amendment in front of you in essence agrees to those changes. They were just changing the opt-in. As you recall we've got an opt-in provision judges don't have to go under the new system unless they want to. We just extended the opt-in provision because we're not really sure at what point any of the appropriation will come effective. Secondly, there was a change where the supplements now will actually reduce as the pay goes up by a portion and told the pay overtakes whatever the current, you know, the highest pay is and then the supplements would go away completely. Additionally there's a change to judicial retirement for superior court judges. They're extending the retirement age from 60 to 65. So that provision we felt like needed more discussion and more consideration rather than being tacked on to another bill on day 40. And in a minute if we do the resolution we are proposing to include retirement in the things that would be studied. But we are taking that change out of Senate bill 479. Additionally there is also a change which in my view is not exactly germane that is to increase our legislative accounts from $7,000 to $14,000. Again that may be a very worthwhile thing to do but I don't believe it should be done hidden in this bill. We need to have a disopened discussion about that issue. And finally the topic of bingo which I know was very near and dear to some members of this house was added. Again I don't believe that should be stuck on a judicial compensation bill and so the amendment that you have in front of you would remove that. I know there's some of you who feel strongly about bingo one way or the other and the particular proposal that has been made about bingo. We used to play it back the over the country a couple of years ago and I remember it very fondly but I don't think it's appropriate to put it in the judicial pay bill. So those are basically the changes we're proposing. We're basically agreeing to the substantive change that the Senate has made to judicial pay because it's still largely what the judicial council compromise was. But we are taking out retirement which has not previously been discussed and we are proposing to remove bingo and the change to legislative accounts. So we feel that what we're proposing is sound policy it brings our judicial pay while it won't change it it will make the pay fairer across the state for all judges and is a first good step to take toward performing judicial pay Georgia. So I would ask your favor will consideration of the motion. General has a couple of questions if you'll. Yes sir I will. First one is to your right chairman buddy the lurch has a question to your right. Is German you yes sir I'm going to ask you this question and I'm not sure it should not be a legitimate parliamentary inquiry. Is it your understanding that if we vote no and your emotion fails that they that we have then disagreed to the Senate amendments. I confess I do not know the answer to the gentleman's question. If I may I think that is correct. Mr. Chairman. Thank you very much. To your left representative I all weems has a question. Thank you to the gentleman yield yes sir I yield point of clarification on the bill the gentleman is bringing. Is this not the bill where the bingo for McIntosh County was stripped away. Is that not so? To my knowledge the what I will affectionately refer to as the McIntosh bingo provision was never in this bill until the Senate made it so yesterday or the previous legislative day. Yes sir. That's where I'm getting we need some clarification you said until the Senate made it so yesterday but it's not in that bill now now. No objections to the judicial part but I need some clarifications why the one of the poorest counties in Georgia gets nothing while bingo remains on C. Allen one of the riches zip codes in Georgia just help me clarify that. Well I would say represent Williams I cannot answer that question as I have not been involved in that debate nor has this bill been involved in that debate until a legislative day ago when it was placed in a judicial compensation bill. Thank you sir I think and we further yield from one last yes sir absolutely. The only reason I ask is because titles of bills this late means nothing you know we couldn't be talking about judges and and and dealing with dog catchers so I just wanted some clarification because I'm real worried about the poverty issue in McIntosh County not being addressed properly not penance but a piece of state. Well and and to the general's question I I certainly based on my affection for some of those who are proponents of that bingo provision I share that concern and would like to address it I just don't know how you address that topic of bingo in a judicial compensation bill you know in a way that preserves the legality of the entire bill based on the domain is gentleman you for a couple more questions yes sir I will represent Jason Ridley to your right is recognize for a question. Yes sir on the judges pay let's get off bingo for a second on the judges pay it's up to the federal judges right the spring no it is not this bill does not increase their pay or mandate that we pay them what the US District Court receives it it takes that as a cap and prohibits and prohibits us from ever appropriating more than that must we come back and change the law this is not an appropriations bill okay now that request is being made separately through the appropriations committee but this bill would not grant them any additional salary okay thank you thank you for the question. Everything chas cannon to your right for a question thank you miss speakers Jim and you yes sir is the opt out provision for local government still containing the amendment it is it it's it's well it's really for the judges it's an opt out if they don't opt into the new system they stay under the curses about for additional judges outside of spear court. This would not apply to judges other than the state paid judges the pellet court and spear court and statewide business court thank you. And to that issue that's part of the reason we have another resolution that would study other judges in the system as well as DA's and public defenders to look at the issue of their compensation but they're low paid locally not by the state. Representative Neil to your left is recognized for a question thank you to the speaker the gentleman you yes sir just like man I you. So I just want to confirm you brought up an issue of germane this I guess my question is has the issue of germane has been addressed or not addressed in this version it was not addressed in the Senate that's oh and it is a farce from say that's all I say about that. Okay thank you. I want to thank you. A former member of the judiciary may be. Ported to hear from him. Chairman Gunther is recognized for a question thank you Mr. Speaker does the gentleman yield yes sir I yield Mr. Chairman. For the bingo provision to be legal it would have to be accompanied by a constitutional amendment would it not. I have heard that said Mr. Chairman I frankly don't know because bingo has not been one of my passions this session. Should I say playing it or legislating with regard to it so I do not know I have been focused on judicial compensation and until one legislator of the day ago did not think bingo and judicial compensation or in some fashion related but I have heard that argument that this particular provision would require constitutional amendment I frankly don't have an opinion on that. Okay thank you thank you. Gentlemen you owe for two final questions yes sir Mr. Speaker glad to. Okay. Representative Tony Miller to your left. Thank you Mr. Speaker does the gentleman yield yes ma'am. I just wanted to clarify what you just stated. Senate inserted to what you consider to be not your main amendments to the judicial compensation bill. That is correct yes ma'am. And your amendment has taken those non-germain provisions out. Correct. Thank you. Thank you that's a good point of clarification. We did however preserve changes made to the judicial compensation portion. Representative Jan Jones to your right up. Bruno I think you know where she sits. It's recognized for a question. Thank you. Mr. gentleman yield yes ma'am. Yes sir is it not true that although the proposal to allow a local government to operate video bingo slot machines may be a way to do it. I think it's not true that the state is not a worthy endeavor. The U.S. Constitution says that it bingo is restricted for the operation by a nonprofit for the purposes of benefiting the nonprofits operations and the measure that it was proposed on other legislation. And so that in this current one that you are removing would be operated by a local government for the purposes of underwriting or paying for the purposes of that local government not a nonprofit. That's my understanding. That is that is the crux of the assertion that it is not constitutional and might be worthy of a constitutional amendment. Yes ma'am. I thank you for mentioning that. Again I have not followed those issues closely but I do believe you have refreshed my recollection. That is correct. Chairman Perkall to your right. How's the question? Thank you Mr. Speaker. Does Jimman yield? Yes sir absolutely. And I thank you for the conversation we had right before you presented this bill on explaining things. Thank you so much for bringing to light what is in the bill and not trying to hide anything. I do appreciate that. Would you please- I would not think there is anything here I would need to hide, Chairman. I would agree. Section 5 that you and I talked to. Would you explain I think there is some confusion as to how other people are tied to superior court judge salary. And what this bill in Section 5 does as it relates to tying it to their salary structure. A big lie to you and thank you for that question because that is an important issue for all of our local governments. There are some officials throughout the state local officials, not state paid officials but local officials whose compensation is tied in some way to superior court judge pay. They get paid what spirit court judges do or they get paid a percentage of it or a fraction of it and usually that is by some local law that we passed. Obviously if we were to increase pay as the bill does not mandate but it would permit, we do not want to impose an undue burden on those local jurisdictions. We want to give them time to make adjustments. So the bill actually suspends that linkage. It basically sort of freezes most of those local officials in place for a year. And the idea there is to- if we were to appropriate more for judges and it would impact those salaries, we as a legislature could make changes to those local laws next year before any change in the local salary took effect. So the local jurisdiction through us could preempt that. It does provide that after a year though if it is a local judge their pay would then connect back up if some change is not made as to other officials it would not- there would still have to be some action to reconnect it or change the salary. So it does treat those officials differently but in any event it seeks to allow some intervention to prevent it from automatically moving up without a chance to prevent that if it is desired that it not happen. Thank you. So if you have a couple other questions, represented still Cox, representor Allen on your right to recognize her question. Does the gentleman yield? Yes ma'am, I yield. Isn't true that this bill will move the judicial pay, the competition package forward? That's true. It's not going to give a judge any more pay but at least we'll set up an infrastructure where the pay is not so wildly varied across the state. And isn't it true that it would eventually help stabilize Superior Court pay throughout the state as well as for the Court of Appeals and Supreme Court? Yes ma'am and it would allow us to determine how and when that happens and on what basis. And isn't it further true that this is necessary because we are losing a lot of great talent to private practice that we need in these especially these appellate courts? I'm so informed just ma'am. Thank you for bringing the bill. I appreciate it. Thank you for your questions. See, Rep. Reese to your left has recognized for a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes or I yield. All right. If you will just bear with me for a moment here. I'm trying to make sure we have this well understood. The reason we are not totally disagreeing with the Senate amendment is because we are okay with the language that gives the op-out for the judicial portion but we totally reject the bingo and the dayspinces of an additional 7000. Correct. And the changes to judicial retirement which have not been discussed in any meeting that I know of. And operationally because we are amending the Senate amendment it by defaults reject their amendment and if we vote this down the whole measure dies. Correct. Thank you sir. And in my diet in response to that the reason I would ask you not to do that is because I want us to send a message to the Senate that we don't disagree with everything that did in this bill. We actually don't agree with the matters that address the original topic of the bill. It's just the new things they brought into it that are not draining. In further reckon I'm in favor of it. I just operationally wanted to get clarity on what's happening. Yes, I certainly understand. I appreciate your question. All right Mr. Speaker if there are no other questions. You have further questions if you want to take them. I'd like us all to get lunch at some point. I'd like to yield the well. Gentlemen says he's going to yield the well. I will ask your favorable consideration and I'll be standing down here while the bills ring if anyone has any questions. Is there any objections to adopting of the House amendment? Chair here is doing it the House amendment is adopted. All the gentlemen's motion that the House agree to the Senate amendments to Senate bill 479 as amended by the House. All those in favor will vote yes. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. All members voted for what purpose does RIPZID Allen Powell rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Spakers it's not true that if you vote real. All members voted for what purpose does RIPZID Allen Powell rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Spakers it's not true that if you vote red on this bill that it's possible time when it comes back from the Senate which it will that you will then be eligible to be on the conference committee if you vote opposed. Gentlemen those rules of this House for what purpose does RIPZID SANE rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Is it not true that this bill creates a pathway to give a raise to the same individuals who fail to help us create the Prosecutorial Oversight Commission? I'm not sure of that but I'm sure the gentleman has his own ideas of all members voted.

We've talked about this and I'm pretty getting invented pretty well. All members voted this so the clerk will lock the machines. On the motion agreed to the Senate substitute, Senate amendment to Senate Bill 479 as amended by the House. The yeas are 117, the nays are 50, and the House has agreed to the Senate amendments to Senate Bill 479 as amended by the House. Chairman Levert is recognized for a motion. It's deja vu all over again, Mr. Speaker. I move that the House agreed to the Senate amendment, the House resolution 1042 as amended by the House. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? House resolution 1042 creating a joint study committee on judicial system compensation. Chairman Levert, how about explain this Senate sub as amended by the House to us? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I think this one's a little easier than the last one. This is basically restoring to House resolution 1042 our original language, which was creating a joint study committee on the pay of other non-state pages. We've also added in here because the Senate had made some changes to retirement. In our view without a lot of discussion, public discussion, and hearing on that topic, we've added the topic of judicial retirement. So that can also be considered as well. So that's what the amendment would do. The bill as it came from us would call a referendum. So that's what the amendment would do. The bill as it came from us would call a referendum on amending the Constitution concerning the issue of local supplements. And we do not believe that is legally necessary. We're trying just to get a joint study committee established to continue to look at these issues and make recommendations. And that's basically the bill. Chairman, has no questions. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I would ask your favor consideration of the motion. So there ain't objection to the adoption of the House amendment. Chair here's known in the House amendment is adopted. On the gentleman's motion that the House agree to the Senate substitute to House resolution 1042 as amended by the House. All those in favor will vote yes. I suppose we'll vote no in the clerk. We'll unlock the machines. I have all members voted all members vote this so the clerk will lock the machines. On the gentleman's motion that their House agree to the Senate substitute as amended by the House of House resolution 1042. The yeas are 161. The nays are five and the House has agreed. We're about ready to break for lunch, but I'm going to allow one of our members that has a guest here and a gallery to continue with a morning order. Representative Dexter Sharper was not able to be in the chamber when we presented our morning orders. Representative Sharper. Thank you, Speaker. All right. All right. We know in the final times of recognizing our women here. Thank you. We're going to recognize someone today who is a creator, producer, director, strategist, TV personality. She also created her own Boote production company, the Spice Group. It's most recognized for creating TI's trap music. That's right, Atlanta's own TI's trap music museum, which has evolved into experience celebrating trap music to a permanent fixture. And the Atlanta's newest tourism attraction. But she has several other projects that she has designed and worked on throughout Atlanta, bringing people far and near to spend money with us. So if y'all don't mind, at this time, we would like to recognize Miss Antoinette, McLaughlin, who is here in the gallery with us. Y'all give her a big hand. Thank you so much. She's an outstanding Georgia citizen. So you an ambassador for us, the state of Georgia, wherever you go in the whole world, continue to represent Georgia. And she's going to take some photos over here in this side with us. Thank you so much. Thank you guys. Welcome to the People's House. We have some announcements at this time.
