Please stand and recite the pledge of allegiance at this time for our morning devotion. To the flag of the United States of America and to the republic of the states, one nation under God, and the people for liberty and justice for all. And now, to the flag of the United States, we're going to have a different world to which it's saying, when is the justice moderation? Oh, me? Good morning. I'm so happy to have a great man of God with us this morning, especially since this is women who are the crown day in the capital. So we have some real crowns up there in the gallery that we will talk about in a little bit. Our Miss Atlanta, South Atlanta, and Miss Fools in County in several of them. But this morning, everyone, I'm honored to introduce a man whose life and work reflects deep faith and an unwavering commitment to the community. Pastor Rodney Greer, Rodney Dexter Greer, has served as a local pastor in the United Methodist faith for 14 years. He has a heart dedicated to small town America, where he believes the principles that define our nation remain strong. Yes, Pastor Greer is a proud graduate of Ashbury Theological Seminary, where he earned his Masters of Divinity. He is an Atlanta native. I know that very well. And grew up in my district. He completed his doctorate of ministry at the International Theological Seminary. He's also the loving husband of Eleanor A. Greer, which is Eleanor Johnson Greer. My big sister right over here. And so I'm just pleased today to welcome Pastor Rodney Dexter Greer. Good morning to this great chamber. Being a minister, senators and great Georgians. Any protocol that I am met, please charge it to my head, not my heart. I'm a man of God, therefore truth is important. Senator James, I'm still matriculating in the final phase of my doctorate from the great ITC, the home of prophetic problem solvers. So thank you. Now, given honor to the president of this great body, you senators and distinguished guests and family, young people, and all who love Georgia, this great state in whom we are serving. I just want to give the proper accolades to our honorable governor who has, in my opinion, led this state and lead this state in a honorable way. He reaches out on both sides of the aisle. Yes, chamber, while we, whom a Democrat, a independent, etc., may not agree with everything that our governor proposed. But he showed courage, Christian courage, in making decisions at tough times. So I just want to give him a hand clap of praise this morning if you will indulge me by giving our governor this great state a hand clap of praise. And continuing with my sister-in-law, Senator James Robinson, you see, it's one thing to be family, but when you see someone that serves, she has been a people's champion. She has always had an open door policy as long as she's been down serving in these chambers and these halls. So I honor her not because she's my sister-in-law, whom as long as the vine go around the stump, that lady over there will always be my sugar-long. Ellen Adelaide Greer, and I tell you, I got a story already and I ain't going to be too long, I know it's Friday. But the sergeant in arms now, it might not my first time being down here, he came up and he gave us his wonderful smile. And then he went to hug my wife and I said, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, cowboy. I know the one to do the hug and that one round there without my permission. So I say that because she's an honorable woman, an incredible mother dedicated to her family. And I love her and I thank God for those who know stranger to the church would understand the words, when God give you a wife, he's done you a favor. Now, hopefully the president, I have this house. I'm just a sinner saved by grace so, but I do have something that I want to say. Let me get my time here and we will be respectful, efficient with all of our times. If I had to title a message this morning, a homily, a three to five minute encouragement to this great body to reach across the house, because we're Georgians. We have some incredible shoulders that we're standing on and Governor Brian Kemp and Sam Nguyen, Senator Nguyen, and the great president of humanity, of moral exeglence, Jimmy Carter, President Carter, Congressman John Lewis, these just a few. And then our she rolls, Fortin County Commissioner, Imadhanel. And then George and has the privilege of birthing one of the great sons and daughters of this state, Juliette Garden Loh, the founder of the Girl Scouts, Lucy Lancy, a pioneer in education who fought for I say American African, not African Americans, because I was born in this country. And I'm just like everyone of you in this Senate chamber. My blood is red and I'm just this patriotic as anybody else in here. And so Lucy Lancy, a pioneer in education, fought for American African students' rights. These are just some of the women who have provided true leadership for this great state. And my sermon or a homily or message or talk or encouragement or pep talk or a moniker to come across these owls and begin to work with each other because the Senate divided shall fall. We must honor the traditions and legacy of this great state. You know, I, many women, servant leaders, I reflect on the immigration situation. And I ask myself, why are people walking 3,000 miles with no shoes on to get to these great shores? Because it is the greatest modern nation created in the civilization of Maine. This great nation allow all of us as the honorable Dr. Martin Luther King with these would say, I have a dream. He, this nation, this liberty that somebody died for on whose shoulders we are standing provides liberty for all of us. So I understand illegal immigrant. How can you get anything out of illegal immigration? That's illegal. But I cannot accept lack of human dignity or the lack of treating people as that they are created with their unalienable rights given not by anybody in this chamber.

I'll create. That's part of the tradition of our great nation. Whom Georgia is a great leader. Being a minister, I hope, and being a minister, I get off my asses and have faith because faith without works is dead. So I was hoping as a prayed and a meditated and got ready for this honorable occasion. And I was thinking, Senate Chamber, President, Lieutenant Governor, Governor, all the Senators. Why can't Georgia lead the nation in showing the nation how we all get along? Why can't Georgia be the state in times like these, where we lead the world and they look to us. That's what our governor has done. He provided ways and means to stand up for his belief, but yet at the same time support his president. So let's frame our arguments in such a way that we're not divided. And then I thought further, men and women, I said, now why is it me being new to this chamber? And I won't be too much longer, but being new to this chamber. So why wouldn't it make sense to me that Republican Democrat, independent, if we work in the government every day, seem like y'all ought to know what each one is in the board of each one. Now because I know the Senator, I know she's working on our children and our seniors and autism and she's talking to this stuff, working to provide legislation for this predatory practice of HOAs. See, we're deliberative, if we make, see I have a bachelor's in science and information system, if we don't unveil anything without a beta of protocol, I show with my government would do that and stop wasting my money, because we put programs out, haven't tested them, don't have any surveys, don't know truly what the people want and we wonder why it was such a flip in this nation and we think that the current president is an aberration. No, he's fighting, the people can feel what he does. So you ain't got to like him, but if you're a citizen of this great native nation in this state, you're going to feel it at your pocketbook. I was talking with the president before and trying to come to some consensus was important to everybody, black, white, juke, jentown, Asian, yellow, all of us, every who that I create or may, my impetus this morning is to focus on our young people. I am completing my matriculation at the prophetic problem solve in creators called ITC, who's creating some incredible fielosures throughout this history. And then it made me pause and say we have to honor, we have a great institution being in women, Georgia Tech, University of Georgia, Emory, Morehouse, Spelman. We have a legacy. So I'm coming close to what the spirit wanted me to say and I want you to start pondering this question because you're significant, you would be sitting in the seat if you, the people didn't feel you would be a servant leader or came to serve. So what legacy are we going to leave behind? What is your legacy? Let me just do this. We come before you. I just want to honor these people and I can do it either way, extemporaneously or manuscript. I just want to say some of these things. We lift up the children of Georgia, the seniors who have paid the way, the workers who label each day, the immigrants who like so many of them seek opportunity and dignity of this land. We may be leaders with honor, the work of every person while upholding the principles of justice and mercy. Lord, we got to do better. We know better and we got to do better. I just want to encourage you all. I know it is trying time and I know it's not easy but I want to remind you of the battles and the power that you raised. Listen to this. So there was a lion looking in a pastor and there were four big bulls in it but they stuck together and Lion wanted to eat them and every time the Lion would come, Democrats, Republicans, Independent, atheists, all of them turned and faced their horns because they fighting for the people. And that lion which can represent lack of jobs and inflation, crime and all the things we don't want. He thought about it. He went to him and he started spraying the rumor over here and he spread the rumor over there. All these that harmony of tax and he spread the rumor over there. And before long those same bulls that were able to defend themselves started fighting amongst each other. Now you know how we do when we fight amongst each other, you get in your colony, you get in that colony. Republicans over here, Democrats over there, Independent's over there and we wonder why the people not have them. So you can figure out the rest because they were divided. That lion was able to eat each bull one at a time. So let's not let inflation, let's not let lack of jobs in Georgia, let's not make sure, let's not make where we're not taking care of seniors and don't have an educational path for our youth, don't have kind and edge technology, but we can't waste the taxpayer of money. Because none of it belongs to anybody in this chamber. It belongs to the people. Everybody in here work for the judges. That's why we're here. I'm a servant and I understand that it's not easy and that you're doing all you can. So I'm hoping in my clothes, my prayer can strengthen us because I need strength likewise. I'm in it serving at Russ Chowpeau in Oxford, Georgia. And you all know the history of coveting in Oxford, Georgia. But I believe in the honorable Dr. Marlotte de Keen. I believe in the leaders whom shoulders we are standing on. I believe in our ancestors and the work that they've done. Black and white Jew and Gentile. We all love this and this nation. And we got to find ways to work with each other. Well preacher, you don't know if I support one of those Democrats, I'm going to get tacked back at my home. Well make sure you put something in the Democrats bill that they want so that they'll be happy. We've got to give a long and we can't do it if we're not talking. Now let's be clear. The sooner they say it, and then about y'all not getting along. I don't do that. I don't talk to people about cream and what you're going to say. Because I rely on the Holy Spirit to speak to my heart. Because I'm just a fifth of Iraq, saved by a God that can save everybody. So I don't need no inside tips and I don't need to do that. I want to know and I talk to everybody I can, but the final voice comes from God Almighty, the Lord Jesus Christ, that God who died on the cross so that all of us can be saved. He died for our liberty. He died for our freedom. He died for our healing. He died for our deaths. He died for our first pass. He died for our equity. And none of us in here are perfect. And so let's move to whatever we can do to benefit the Georgia's of this great, great state. Would you please stand as I close us with prayer? Buy your hair, humbly. Whatever God you serve, ask you to have reverence to that God. I'm a Christian, a United Methodist. Believe in John Wesley and Charles Wesley, the foundational teaching that the Founding Father's brought. Let us pray. Lord God of Abraham, Lord God of Isaac, Lord God of Jacob. We thank you for Jesus, your son, who's engrafted all of us into the perfect family on deserve. Lord, I know things are evolving and I know it's not what it should be and I know we all have ups and downs and I know Lord they're doing the best they can. I know Lord they have to run elections. I know Lord that they have to please their constituents. I know Lord they matched against the media in all his power. I know Lord they don't have endless money. I know Lord that they're doing the best they can. While we're on this pilgrims journey, Lord, let this great body break out into a new covenant, a new, the very pledge of Georgia that they say it, Lord, that they recite it, the very pledge of allegiance that they honor of this great nation. Lord, let them be men and women that work across the Isles. If that's what they want to call, whatever they want to call it, whatever they want to name it, Lord, just let it be so that the people of this great state, just like we have immigrants walking 3,000 miles, everybody will say that they want to come to Georgia. So I ask you to look after our governor as we say in the church of old from the crown of his head to the soul of his feet. Lord, I ask you to cover the homes while these senators are way as they travel and try to handle the business of Georgia. Lord, all the supporting cast because they can't do it by itself, all the secretary and all the sub-offices and all that it make up this great capital that it functions efficiently, not wasting money, but making very legislations that benefit our people and benefit all people no matter the color of his skin. Lord, we just thank you for the honorable Dr. Martin Luther King. We just thank you for the great HEPC, More House, Spailment College and RTC. We thank you for Emory educating new creative mind in an hour, in an hour of A.R. Lord, just let human dignity outrun technology. Lord, just let our human dignity be such that this technology benefit mankind so that we can spend more time with our wives and spend more time with our children. It's been more time at our churches and synagogues and temple that we can spend more time with our precious loved ones. Father, let it not be used for wicked and asparagus's purposes, but Lord, let people come together now and realize it's not changing. And then Lord, as I continue to work on Generation Z between 18 to 22, trying to build the bridge across trouble waters because we know there are trouble waters. We can come inside of these four walls, Lord, and act like everything, all right, but people are suffering in this world. I agree with the president, they killing must stop. The innocent killing 134 children. Lord, I don't care who's right, but stop it now, Lord. In anything, these great Georgians who're going to go on to be great leaders in this nation. In Lord, for all we know, the next president of the United States is in Georgia. And I just thank you, Lord, for Senator James and cover her in her goodness and just wrap your arms a love around and burn it up her husband, Lord, don't forget about my house. So don't forget about my mother. Don't forget about my brother. Don't forget about my wife. In Lord, in my heart of heart, I hope my words have been pleasing in the father of creation, in his son, and in his Holy Spirit. And Lord, if you please, then I'm good with that. Lord, I just thank you. Bless them, consecrated in the message's name of Jesus. Amen. Good morning, colleagues. It's my privilege to now introduce our doctor of the day. I've got Dr. Sanford Duke. We know him as Sandy Duke back home. He is a distinguished health care leader and a dedicated servant of the people of middle Georgia. He's also a very dear friend of mine. We have the chance to have family share time together. He is also an abbot outdoorsman and a hunter. Loves a duck hunt, bird hunt, and all kind of outdoor hunt. And just a good guy, Sandy got his bachelor degree from Duke University and went on to the medical college of Georgia to get his MD degree, completed his residence in head and neck surgery at Wake Forest University, and also holds a Master of Business Administration. How about that for a well-rounded guy? Today, Dr. Duke serves as Executive Vice President of Chief Financial Clinical Officer of Atrium Health Care, one of our major hospitals there in Macon. He leads the clinical operational and strategic initiatives. His career is over 25 years, but he's not just been an administrator for two decades. He serves in private practice taking care of the folks of middle Georgia in the head and neck surgery area before transitioning to the administrative side of what he does, which he started in 2020 on the leadership team. He's been instrumental in advancing health care across our state. As I said, he's a great guy and a good friend of mine. I'm glad he's going to be our doctor of the day. If you need him, you're in good hands. Let me introduce Dr. Sandy Duke. Thank you very much, Lieutenant Governor. Senator Kennedy, it's a real honor to be here on behalf of Atrium Health, our 600 employed physicians and APPs and our 13,000 teammates across the state. It's truly an honor to be here. Being here reminds me of my pride I have for the state and my citizenship and the greatest state in the union. So thanks for what you do, it's truly an honor and I appreciate you. Thanks. Are there any unanimous concerns? I'm sorry. Does any Senator wish rise on a point of personal privilege? I recognize Senator from the 29th for a point of personal privilege. Thank you, Mr. President. There are times that everything lines up and with what we've been going through as a nation since 2019, I can't think of something that lines up more than our experience with the pandemic than with the experience we had many years ago with polio. And I want to recognize and remind everybody and make those of you who do not know make you aware that we are now commemorating the 70th anniversary of the polio vaccination campaign. This eradicated polio in the United States while we still have issues with it throughout the world, I think that this is a great example where early in our time where our president, Dwight Eisenhower, along with government leaders throughout the United States and along with the medical community, realize that we were all going to have to work together to tackle something as terrible as polio. I'm proud to represent the county of Maryweather as one of my counties where the little White House is and where the Roosevelt Institute is and where the great president Roosevelt passed away when he passed away. And so please remember as you talked everybody about vaccines and other things, remember that we are celebrating the 70th anniversary of the the nationwide polio vaccination. I want to thank Dr. Rick Ward for bringing this to us. I want to thank Dr. Rick Ward for bringing this to us and to change gears real quickly. Today would have been my mother's 83rd birthday, Elizabeth Cobb Robertson. I know she's somewhere where she can hear me, so I want to tell her thank you again. I want to tell my sister, Barbara Ann and my sister Linda Cheryl for helping my mother raise their son. And with that Mr. President, I yield the well. I'm going to send it from the 33rd. Thank you Mr. President, my fellow senators, colleagues, friends and y'all. Today we are is recognition for our life university's excellence. Life university located in Marietta, Georgia is the largest single campus chiropractic university in the world known for its commitment to health sciences and its philosophy of lasting purpose. The university has cultivated a culture of excellence in academics and athletics, producing student athletes who embody discipline resilience and teamwork. Life university just recently made history by winning its first ever NAIA Women's Wrestling National Championship, setting a new NAIA record for total team points. The championship victory highlights the university's commitment to athletic excellence and leadership and collegiate wrestling. The head coach, Ashley Flavin, was named the NAIA head coach of the year, recognizing her leadership and guiding the team to national success. Under the leadership of the head coach, they were able to reach tremendous heights. These achievements set a new standard of excellence in NAIA wrestling and inspire student athletes across Georgia and the nation. Life university wrestling programs emphasized perseverance, sportsmanship, and teamwork values that extend beyond athletics into academics and professional success. Let's put our hands together and welcome them up to the NAGALI Life University Athletes. Mr. President, I yield the well. We're going to have a center from the fourth. Thank you, Mr. President. This is just for general information purposes. I'll read you. This is out of North Carolina. North Carolina government cashed in early when it came to reaping the fiscal benefits from authorized sports wagering in the state. A report, a report presented in Wienzy to the North Carolina Lottery Commission, which regulates the betting says that the state expects to have collected $131 million in taxes from sports betting operations for the first full year. The amount goes well beyond estimates of state legislative researchers as the bill worked this way through the General Assembly. They have projected tax revenues can reach $100 million in five years and it reached $131 million in the first year. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield well. We're going to have a center from 39. Thank you, Mr. President. Colleagues, I rise today with great appreciation to recognize and celebrate the Atlanta Jewish Film Festival. AJFF has been more than just a film festival. It has been a bridge bringing people together through the power of storytelling. Founded in 2000 by the Atlanta Regional Office of the American Jewish Committee, this festival has become a cornerstone of our state's cultural landscape offering films that entertain, educate, and spark meaningful conversations. What makes AJFF so...

special is its ability to connect us to history, to identity, and to one another. Through films that are thought-provoking, moving, and sometimes even challenging, this festival helps us see the world through different perspectives while deepening our understanding of Jewish life, culture, and contributions. Each year, AJFF curates an experience that is as diverse as Atlanta itself, bringing world-class cinema to our city and fostering dialogue that strengthens the tie between communities. At its heart, this festival is driven by values we can all embrace, courage, curiosity, compassion, and collaboration. This year's festival marked the 25th anniversary and featured 63 films over 16 days on the big screen and 10 days streaming. So today, I want to express my gratitude to the Atlanta Jewish Film Festival. And we have members of the organization with us including Kenny Blank, Executive and Artistic Director, and Sarah Davenport, Managing Director, along with Executive Staff and Board Members. This Senate resolution that we passed earlier, SR 389, recognizes you not just for the films you showcase, but for the connections you build and the conversations you expire. Colleagues, please join me in recognizing AJFF and made this organization continue to thrive and enrich Georgia for years to come. Thank you. We're going to have the Senate from 36. Thank you, Mr. President, colleagues. And again, we're so pleased to have the Atlanta Jewish Film Festival folks here with their leadership. Remarkable, remarkable gift to our community. Colleagues, I want to speak briefly on the latest mistaken steps that we see coming out of Doge in Washington and that directly impact us here in Georgia. You know, if you don't want or need any services, you might turn a blind eye to the cuts that are being made. But if you rely on our government for vital services, listen up and plan to take action and let us know what the plight is that you are in as a result of that. I'm sorry, this morning, tell me, our mother could not get through social security. An office that's been widely available and now sadly shuttered in location after location. Right here in Atlanta, the federal buildings that are all around us, housing workforce and doing vital services. Well the federal agency that manages the government's real estate took off the list, all kinds of buildings that they want to put on the market and close down. That's the general services administration. And they have listed as advertised on the chopping block 17 properties across Georgia, including two downtown Atlanta landmarks with no explanations of why they should be pulled. It's been pointed out by people who know better that it's not typical at all for government to move in this hazard fashion. Governments usually move in a measured way. And finally we have our own homegrown marjorie Taylor Green, leveeing attacks at public broadcasting. And the motive is clear. Trump and Elon Musk want a D fund, PBS and Marjorie Taylor Green is a handmaiden in that. PBS asks tough, smart and informative questions of our leaders at the state and federal level to hold them accountable. And that's why the Musk and Trump administration want public media to go away because they don't want anyone to hold them accountable. PBS chief executive is warning that stations across the country will be in jeopardy if PBS is defunded. And PBS has a nonpartisan listening audience. Let me just point out to you. So I'm asking you today to look and see at the services you rely on and need, including public broadcasting, and speak out, don't be, don't, don't power, be loud, be proud and stand up for government services for our people. Thank you. I'm going to recognize the center from six. Thank you, Mr. President. The daughter of Trooper Royce today, he's a Trooper out of Marietta. Our troopers and all law enforcement do an amazing job. And I just want to ask that you keep their daughter in your thoughts and prayers and I appreciate it very much. Thank you all. Thank you, Mr. President. Senators, I'm proud to have welcomed the Georgia Haitian American Chamber of Commerce. They are here today. There are many are seated upstairs in the gallery. And believe it or not, I was a commentator on Haitian voice radio for about nine years. So I'm particularly happy today to have many of the people who was on that national station with me. So please stand up and be recognized. The Georgia Haitian American Chamber of Commerce. Let's give them a warm welcome. Thank you. Good morning, colleagues. I am so thrilled and having so much fun today because I have very special visitors. Lots of fourth graders from Fernbank Elementary School in Decap County. Fernbank is a great school and these kids are so smart and learning so much. Enjoy your time here. We are so glad your teachers brought you and thank you for all the hard work that you are doing teachers into Cap County Schools and to all the parents who helped make this feel trip possible. I yield them all. All right. Thank you Senator. We're going to have Senator from the 16th. Thank you Mr. President. On your desk I wanted you to look at Ron Decentos made an announcement and two years ago they had tort reform in Florida. And what you're seeing is this. There were major changes that he made announcements of what was going on in Florida. Three major carriers reducing personal auto rates. Homeowner's rates for one of the major companies 5% and an overall decrease in premiums. He just goes to show that with tort reform can make a difference in what we have to pay for our insurance and they put up with you put up the proper laws and proper challenges that the companies are dealing with. Read that. I think you enjoyed it. Florida has done a great job and I believe that Georgia has done a great job as we move forward. Thank you Mr. President. Does any other Senator wish rise on point of personal privilege? You have before you consent calendar privilege resolutions as any Senator wish remove resolution from the consent calendar.

Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. President. Colleagues, I bring you House Bill 38. This is a needs-based financial aid program commonly referred to as the Georgia College Completion Grant Program. It's been a very successful program for Georgia. What this legislation does is it does two things. It extends the timeframe, if you'll note, online 25 from June 30th of 2025 to 2029. And it adjusts the eligibility requirement, actually recognized reality. And it says this is a completion grant program. It reduces the requirement from 80% credit requirements for a bachelor's degree or a four-year program to 70. And then it adds the opportunity for those who are in two-year programs to also participate in this grant if they have completed 45% of the credit requirements for a two-year program. Mr. President, I'm happy to take questions or I'm happy to yield the well. One question, Senator. I recognize the center from the 26. Why is it? My good friend. Some of the year. Absolutely. Some of this, so what this bill does, it takes us back to the original version of when we pass the hoop scholarship. This is a completion grant program. The center would know what the original grant program looked like. The good news is this enhances and extends the eligibility to students who are completing their degrees in Georgia colleges and universities. There are no further questions. Mr. President, you know the headline question. I'm sorry, Senator. I didn't know if the center from the 26 was done yet. I'm sorry. I recognize the center from the 36. Thank you, Mr. President. Chairman Yew. I'm happy to yield my good friend. Wonderful. Thank you. And just to speak and strongly and supportive of this, this is all part of our efforts that we're seeking to put together the resources to be sure that people for lack of a little bit of change, the last few, a couple of hundred, three hundred dollars that they need to pay as they're working towards that degree that we step up and say we're going to be there for those students that have demonstrated their academic prowess and have demonstrated their desire to learn and to graduate and be a part of our workforce. Successful Georgia families and that this is all in the spirit of making it possible for more of our Georgia students to finish their degrees. The center is correct. This is a part of an ongoing effort to ensure that students who are very close to degree completion have the last amount of resources needed to earn their degree and become productive contributors to Georgia's society. And isn't it true further question that this sort of investment is smart investment that's going to yield great benefits for Georgia families and for Georgia's economy? It is exactly correct. It's a great investment. I want to thank the center for 36 and the center for 40th for continuing to work on resources that can be provided for those who are near degree completion. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield a well. The center is yielding. Does any other center wish to speak for against the measure? Chair here is none. Is there objection to previous question being ordered? Chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there objection to agreeing to the Board of Committee which is favor to the passes of the bill? Chair here is none. The Board of Committee is agreed to. Is there objection to the main question being ordered? Chair here is none. The main question is ordered. The question is on the passage of the bill. All those in favor of vote, yay. All opposed, nay. Secretary and a lot of the machine. Thank you. On the pass of the bill, the yeas are 46 and the nays are five. the constitution majority is there for pay. Moving on to House bill 68, Secretary. House bill 68, Representative Burns, the 159th and others, bill to be in town tonight to make and provide appropriations for the state fiscal year beginning July 1st, 2025 and ending June 30th, 2026 to make and provide such appropriations for the operation of state government and departments, board, and spirit. Commission institutions, other agencies with the emergency system, common schools, counties, municipalities, and bloodless subdivisions for all of the governmental activities, projects, and undertaking authorized by law. And for all leases, contracts, agreements, and grants authorized by law to provide for the control and administration of funds. It's a right for an effective date for payable for looking laws and for other purposes. Mr. President, the Senate committee on appropriations recommends that this bill do pass by substitute, respectfully submitted, Senator Tillery, chairman. Mr. President, the Senate committee on appropriations offers to follow in substitute to House bill 68, bill to be in town tonight to make and provide appropriations for state fiscal year, beginning July 1st, 2025 and ending June 30th, 2026 to make and provide such appropriations for the operation of state government and department sports bureaus and for other purposes. Mr. President, the complete see order. We're going to have appropriations here. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you members of the Senate. I know that my debate will greatly change the outcome of this vote. The, present to you now, House bill 68 rather, House bill 68, the state's general budget for 2026. So thank you, the need to be given first. As you know, we work with OPB and the all session appreciate their help. We also appreciate the work of chairman Hatchett and his committee in the Senate and the House to get the bill over to the Senate. A few other folks need to be thanked as well are Senate budget staff who's scattered around the room. Lindsey Courtney Jennifer Emily. Caitlin started this. I miss myself. Well, Caroline, oh my goodness. I've done this Austin Brent. Emma and then of course, y'all know Miss Angela, too. Miss Angela was here when I was an intern 20 years ago. And she is having her 39th birthday again today. Miss Angela, happy birthday. Thank you for everything you've done for Senate appropriations. For over 20 years, what you also don't know is with the day that our bill was in committee, Miss Angela fell that morning and broke her arm. And her biggest concern was getting to the committee meeting and we were trying to tell her that is not a concern. Please go get seen about your dedication to second and non. Thank you for all the help you've been to us. Also, I ask you don't mind giving another round of applause for the Senate budget staff and everything they've done. Thank you for helping us here. The Senate's budget real lines some of the funding you may have seen in the House. And it's a recognition of what we're looking at at the national level. As you know, the federal government is in a position now to realign its budget, get its fiscal house in order for the first time in decades. We support that initiative, but it might mean some changes on the state level. In contrast, Georgia's done much differently. We budgeted within our means for many, many decades. We have a balanced budget amendment. And we remain in the bottom 10% of states in per capita spending, even after a surge of spending and state level taxes at the local level. Sorry, a property taxes at the local level. The state has also continued to return billions of dollars to our citizens, even doing that again this year. $2.4 billion less collected this year in property taxes than would have been collected, had we not begun reducing the income tax several years ago. And you have a commitment this year for us to continue to do that again. The Senate's budget proactively funds our priorities and the needs of the state without issuing more debt, even traditional debt that we've normally done in a bond package. And we rejected the urge to supplant federal funding from COVID-19 programs that are aspiring this year, including the ESSA and ARPA programs. We tried to hold true to funding formulas, whether that meant it increases or decreases in budgets. And the Senate budget eliminates certain programs that you'll see later on. It slows the growth of many positions that we're added in the budget. And it questions invoices that were brought to us that did not have justification on how they were spent. The Senate's budget also prepares us for future years by enumerating in various lines the bills that required additional spending. And I really think that's the biggest takeaway of the Green Door, the subcommittee process this year, is we realize that a lot of the bills that we pass, a lot of the bills we're considering today, a lot of the bills we may be amending in the next few days, have a fiscal cost. Whether that cost is asking for a study from a department, it's adding a requirement and Medicaid. It's saying that we should allow an expansion of a program that already exists. Those expansions are not free. And we tried to go through this budget and lay out which bill required the additional spending and you'll see that detailed in your Senate budget proposal. As you know, we spend roughly 53, 54% of our budget on education. We spend roughly 23% of that budget in health. And I'm going to start by talking about health, the health part of our budget, and then maybe save education towards a little bit later on. In health at the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities, over the past five years, we've sent about a 25% increase in that budget. And we continued that increase this year in mental health services. We added 200 now-comp waivers and annualized an additional 100 now-comp waivers. We also funded continued funding for the Make-In Stabilization Center. And kept a continued focus on forensic beds. It's something that we've heard that was a need from our prisons. We've heard it from our court system. We've heard it from our local sheriffs. And we've heard it from our Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities. The Senate budget also eliminates a contract with a vendor who left state medical providers holding the bag for about 2.7 million in savings on that item. We also cut back and receded on funding that you saw may have been added in the House. Again, trying to balance this budget. And we held House increases at the Georgia Housing Voucher Program, which was also we know a priority of the Department and to move out from under certain settlements that the state had entered in previously. We continued the Senate's priority to treat autism and support families whose children are afflicted with that. But we also had to say no to many worthy but not yet fully contemplated measures that also were in the DBA CD budget. At the Department of Community Health, we supported the House increases for provider rates for primary care codes and dental codes. But we did that at one half the level that the House did. We also supported ABA therapy and a 3% rate increase there. We supported the full rate increase for neonatologists and maternal fetal medicine. And we did not support rate increases for ventilators, speech or adorable medical equipment. The Senate supported EMS rate increases at 5% for seven EMS codes. And we funded, began to increase funding to begin transport reimbursement at mile six. Currently the first 10 miles are not reimburseed. We also bought some reimbursement at 10. We decided to take it to 6 to 10. The Senate's proposal also funds PTSD and wraparound services for Georgia's veterans in DCH and their families. We continued the House and Governor practice of fully funding the skilled nursing facility audited cost reports. And we agreed with our House and held $3.1 million in our budget to support our independent pharmacies in the state health benefit plan. We also added $5 million into that, into line item, just a little bit below that for pharmacy reimbursement, for drug dispenses dispensed rather to persons for self administration. In an amount equal to the national average acquisition cost, which is the NADAC. The Senate's budget also adds 150 new residency programs. We asked the Department to apply for a state plan amendment so that those dollars can be maximized through Medicaid, just like the state of Florida has been able to do. In public health, we removed funds and eliminated the Georgia coordinating council that saved about $3 million. We transferred duties there elsewhere. And we also sought opportunities to reduce future cost by funding certain viral hepatitis programs. The cost of those programs are very expensive on the back end. We wanted to try to address them up front. In public safety, for the courts, we began all positions and all pay raises as of January 1, which allowed the Senate to recruit some savings there. We also eliminated some lawful, but not yet started initiatives. And we began a rate increase or a pay increase for prosecuting attorneys, acknowledging that we needed to raise their base pay in order to help them with retention. We did remain true to the formulas, however, related to prosecuting attorneys and public defenders. And we started all of those rate increases, those pay increases as of January 1. In corrections also under public safety and for our purposes, the governor's proposal added about $125 million to the corrections proposal. The house added about 250 and we sort of split the middle in there and added about 170 million to the initiative related to retention and security at our state presence. In the GTI, we funded the MAKIN Crime Lab. We funded the lab equipment associated there. And we funded five portable mass spectrometers to assist in getting quick results for assistant district attorneys and other departments who were waiting. The answer to proposals that have been brought to them concerning criminal matters by our law enforcement agencies. We held $100,000 for the cold case unit, which is a reduction from the house, but it's an increase to the base of that program over last year's budget. At the CCC, there was an ad for roughly $9 million for our victims assistance related to our sexual assault centers and to other cross centers related to victims assistance. We're expecting that they're anticipating $12 million of federal funds so we pulled back on the $9 million increase from the on the state level there and sold them instead to utilize and expect those that 12 million federal funding. At the Department of Geoval Justice, we're very proud of the commissioner and the work she's done. We support the pay increases there at 8% in certain categories with high turnover and 4% in others. Now public safety, we continue to be careful on the addition of additional staff and we recognize the payments to chief of police and sheriff's in the amended budget rather than adding it to their base budgets. Just to keep up with transparency there, I do believe that we will support any increases needed there in the amended budget. At the Department of Law, we pulled back slightly on the number of positions that were added. We remain supportive of gang prosecution units and the expansion of human trafficking units into Augusta and into Maicon. We transferred $50,000 to the judicial council to just help resolve any dispute that may have arisen starting whether or not the Department of Law can represent the judicial branch due to conflicts of branches and separation of powers. In the Department and under transportation generally, roughly 7% of our budget. At DDS, we acknowledge the use of technology and support by requesting evidence that that technology has allowed them to reduce their need for additional personnel. And in the Department of Transportation, we continue to the utilization of motor fuel for most construction and maintenance projects. We also held the House ad for airport aid and we added $2 million based upon member requests for traffic improvements in the Cumberland CID area. Education, roughly 53-54% of our budget depending on the year. At the Department of Early Care and Learning decal, we supported the Governor and House recommendation for 500 additional state funded cap slots. We're now on our way to funding those without federal help. That would mean we've now raised that number to about 50,000 caps spots state wide. We continued to fund our pre-K program and agreed with the House and the Governor with $14 million increase to continue phase in of the reduced class sizes from 22 to 20. At the Department of Education, we continued as you know to fully fund the QBE teaching formula. We did reduce other funds based on testing from previous budget years and we took some reductions based upon utilization. We did increase funds for character education and we funded at a different level a program that passed on a Senate bill by the senator from the 45th last year relating to school supplies in the classroom. Literacy, you know it has been an issue of this chamber for many years championed by the senator of the fourth and others. The Senate did not change any house dollars as it relates to literacy. In student services, the Senate deleted an initiative that was begun by the House. We took it to zero but it shouldn't be considered zero because we pulled forward apex funding out of the Department of Behavioral Health. It's already being used for mental health services in our schools combined it with $5 million additional dollars and parked it there instead. We took it out of the mental the student support services line and rolled it into school safety. The reason we did that is we do believe that the mental health of our students is directly related to the safety of our schools. We did not support the houses out of $28 million for a targeted program related to the economically disadvantaged instead choosing to recognize the over $1.5 billion in the base that supports this effort. We did support increased funds of about $12.5 million for out of school care and in the Senate's biggest budget move we restored fully funded the promise scholarship at 1% of QBE which is $141 million. This would allow 21,000 students and their families options when their schools that they would otherwise be attending are in the bottom quartile of schools of our state. In regents we reduced funds that Georgia Cyber Center this is based upon five years ago that yes now they've been started for about seven years. Five years ago they were going to move to be fully self-supported on rents. We're now and I believe you're seven maybe even you're eight so we're just reducing their state general funds to continue the trend to support their move on to being self-sufficient. And we did not support the Senate the House's addition of additional funds into the micro grant program. We did support the technology research into the peanut industry and we kept the House cut to public law schools but returned the base funding for legal clinics. In ERS employees retirement the House had a line that was for $23 million to allow for a 13th payment of sorts for state retirees. The Senate committee increased those funds to almost $76 million for annual payments to state retirees and to help with record high inflation they've experienced over the past half decade. We also want to use part of those funds to improve the funded ratio which is necessary if they're ever going to be able to start up and recommence their COLA program. In general government which is just about everything else I haven't already mentioned. At the Department of Ag we did acknowledge the state's significant concern with avian flu and want to support the state's poultry industry there. We also continued to fund future lab needs at the agency. As you know we did part of this already roughly $40 million in the amended budget for buildings. Also at the state farmers market there was an additional ad. We have continued to fund those with plans to reconstruct the office on Capitol Hill. There's now discussion about putting the lab that used to be on Capitol Hill out at the state farmers market. There's a plan to do that. The House had that plan funded at half the amount 20 is $1 million. The Senate funded it instead as a planning bond of $4 million that allowed us to recruit some savings but also make sure that we're completely on the same page with the department and the House. Concerny whatever we're going to put at the state farmers market knowing that that's going to be a multi decade investment. Farrell hogs have been plaguing our farmers. It was a half a million dollar ad in the House related to Farrell hogs. The Senate has a much different proposal that half a million dollars will supposed to be used to buy pens that cost roughly $14,000 each. You basically corral like a buffalo run the hogs into a pens and then they eradicate them from there. Half a million dollars to do so. The Senate's proposal leverages our hunters in the state and instead creates a reward based program based on the number of hogs eradicated with weekly payouts to eliminate the Farrell hog program. Not only the we think that's going to be more effective we're able to fund it at 20% of the otherwise requested cost. At community affairs the department of community affairs there were areas where providers were unable to provide receipts for its miniatures. We zeroed out those items in the future. We supported the city of Albany's efforts to continue its support of history and childhood learning in its downtown. And we supported the plans of the governor and House to reduce various programs consolidate those and make them more efficient for services provided to our citizens. We also reduced two of our state's largest economic programs the state economic development program state of two of our state's largest economic development programs. Rather I'm sorry the Riva program and the one Georgia program we had various legislative ads over the years since we're now at a position where we need to start looking at every dollar even more scrupulously. We reduced the legislative ads that have been added to those programs over the years. In the department an economic development we recognize base funding instead of increasing funds at the MLK Center and we delayed support of the Super Bowl 62 and 2031 NCAA final four programs for the same reasons that we stated in the amended budget. Super Bowl 62 is three years away as you know the NCAA final four for 2031 is six years away. If we're going to fund those now we would allow those entities to hold the interest on state funds. Why would we not hold those seven million dollars and the interest on those in state funds allow those dollars to further be used to reduce property taxes income taxes whatever we decide and fund those things instead in the years that they're occurring. At DHS we were able to reduce funds based upon a new program. We had an employee come to us years ago and say hey the contract for verifying late wage and labor data has gone overboard. It keeps going up every year. There's a Georgia based company that did it. We think we can do it cheaper in house if we're able to bid that out on a reverse auction. That idea has been successful and it's going to allow us to actually reduce that funding item by two million dollars this year. At the Department of Labor we pulled back some ads that were put in by the House just to give the new commissioner time to prepare her plan moving forward. And at natural resources we left a million dollars for beach restoration. 349,000 dollars concerning red breast coastal fishing that relates to some of the reef fishing there and surveys kind of complications of those surveys with federal programs. We reduced EPA's budget by $581,000 to streamline their contracting process. And we pulled back increases that have been added for the venison processing and chronic wasting disease programs. We think they're both important but they have base funding we wanted to recognize that rather than make an additional ads. Public Service Commission we were able to support their retention requests and we were able to reduce its expenditures for the forest land protection land grants at the Department of revenue based upon previous years its expenditures. We provided $600,000 in the state election board that's under the Secretary of State and we gave some language concerning reducing rents at other places again helping to promote efficiencies there. And in our Department of Veterans the Senate's budget adds $3.5 million to various veterans related care and we're extremely excited about the standing up and opening and continuing rather of the sub acute care unit that's coming online later this year. You know we normally bond capital projects in our budget you're not going to see a bond package in the Senate's proposal. We're funding that with cash saving generations 10 and 20 years from now for paying for the buildings that we're building currently. We disagreed with the House's plan to move with a bond package again and opting instead to fund these cash initiatives or these initiatives with cash. And that caused us to have to delay a couple of projects as well. We had to delay the project that Ag already told you you're doing it instead with a planning bond and we had to delay a project at the Department of Juvenile Justice. That probably wasn't ready to go yet anyway. The capital project list however is not going to have very many ads and I want to prepare you that's probably the way it's going to be in years moving forward. We did fund design at Augusta Tech and we were able to fund a building at the University of Georgia with an alternate fund source. But funding for other capital resources generally is just going to align with what you already saw come from the second floor in the original budget proposal. One thing I do want to point out to you that we did different this year you've got your budget you get it on your desk each year. If you turn to the first white page you will see a list. We are often asked in Georgia why we don't just take our state income tax to zero. Our state income tax in Georgia makes up about $16 billion and we can take that to zero. But we have to decide what we want to otherwise exempt first. See states around us Tennessee, Florida, Texas. We're here in now Mississippi. Georgia does not tax things that those other states do. Let's use for instance Texas. If a plumber comes to your house, if an automacanics fixing your car, if a builder is building your house, the state of Georgia does not charge.

for sales tax on that labor. You know this, you pay your labor bill based on what the labor cost was, no additional tax. In Texas, there's a 6.25% tax on that labor. That's a policy decision for us to make in the future. Would we like the tax labor, like Texas does instead of income? I really would love for us to have that debate. If we were to tax services instead in Georgia, if you look on the chart that we gave you of the tax credits and tax exemptions in our state that are on page one of your budget now, that's an additional 12.2 billion dollars. If we were to tax services instead, we can move to almost eliminate the state income tax over night. We could also decide that we want to end some of these other exemptions. They're laid out there for you. The tax on manufacturing on energy use and manufacturing, that's about $4.8 billion in sales tax exemptions there. The standard deduction for impersonal exemption, that's about $3.4 billion. The retirement income exemption on our state income tax, that's about $2.1 billion. The sales tax exemption on all food consumption, all premises food consumption, that's about $1 billion. The sales tax exemption on drugs and prescription drugs and contact lenses, that's about a little over half a billion dollars. The sales tax exemption on lottery tickets, that's almost $300 million. So I tell you, we're going to get asked to vote on a lot of credits and a lot of exemptions after this budget passes in the next three days. What I want to highlight for you is that every time you do that, you move further and further away from what my personal goal is of being able to reduce the state income tax further. Think about that as you vote. The list on the front book hopefully gives you some calls to question and think about matters moving forward. And again, ask the budget overall. Thank you for allowing me to chair the budget now for the six year. And Mr. President, if there are no questions, I'll yield the vote. You do have a few questions. Break it out of the center for the 26th. So the year. Yes, sir. Sorry. So I want to thank you for doing what you good to make sure that the crime lab in making this is up and running. Question for you. Where are we with the Department of Corrections and the FATs? Didn't with the prison system? Yes, sir. I don't know where we are with the feds. I know that we're going to try to address our own issues if federal intervention intervention or not. You saw that we put almost a billion extra dollars in the amended budget relating to security, relating to locks. And the next this budget on the Senate side includes about 170 million focused mostly on retention of employees. We've got to increase the pay at our state prisons. We're asking them to do a job that I venture to say very few of us would be willing to do if we were put in that situation. So the commissioner has been able to improve retention greatly, which is why you have one of the big additions you do have in this budget. They were funding pay increases in the past off of vacancies. The fact that we're having to include money here should tell us that that work on our retention program has been so is being successful. I'm bringing out the senator from the floor. Thank you, Mr. President. Sir, are you you? Yes, sir. I really appreciate you bringing this to our attention. I think we need to study this. We need to look at it by chance if you added up these numbers or some of the budgets that have added up these numbers. I could do it very quickly and you're talking about the sales tax exemptions and tax credits. I'm talking about everything. In fact, if you want me to, I'm done it. You want me to tell you what it is? Well, yes, sir. And I'll tell you though that that's not all of them. We only took and included the biggest 11. There's over 100. Well, these biggest 11 account for 26.64 billion dollars. And what is our budget amount? Our total state general funds budget is around 37 billion. So this amounts about two-thirds of our budget. So the math would tell you if we're able to eliminate exemptions and credits, we can reduce our taxes further. We can. Thank you, sir. I'm bringing that as the senator from the 38th. Thank you, Mr. President. Does the chairman yield? Yes, sir. Thank you for all your hard work on the budget. I did have a couple questions. One student support services, 167.1. Looks like the house proposed adding about 20 million dollars for establishing mental health support grants. And I was curious why we are taking that out. Yeah. And when I was presenting it, you may have missed when I told you this. We did not take it out. We zeroed it out. You said, give me the line, Adam. 167.1. It references 164.2. You get a 164.2. We already fund a program called APEX. It's been at the Department of Behavioral Health. What we try to do is bring that program and the funding that's related to mental health services in schools already. Recognize that in this area and add to it additional state general funds. That dollar we ended up out was around $14 billion. Million dollars rather not the house is 19 million dollars. But we're supporting the exact same program at a different amount and doing it instead in the school safety program. So when you say a different amount, is it at the same amount or is it lower? It's lower. It's $5 million. Okay. Got you. And then still a $14 million increase. Right. And then for the wait for educating targeting students for economically disadvantaged. I know you mentioned this. Yes. The house proposed $28 million. Is it not true that Georgia is only one of six states that does not provide an additional weight. Understanding we do get Title I funding. Right. But Georgia does not provide an additional weight in our QB formula to educate students that are identified as economically disadvantaged. Is that not true? I disagree with that. I know that that's been a point of GBI and many others for years. I believe that the program we already have about equalization is meant to fund a poverty weight. That program we fund it roughly. Let's see your equalization is about 900 million for the state 909 million. That is specifically meant to go to and help balance low poverty school systems. The biggest recipient is actually when net county because of the number of poverty children, the children in poverty that they have there. But is it not true that an additional $28 million would have helped school districts across the state that have had an additional weight? Again, back to the original question, are we one of six states? I have to say that that's not true. I don't know that those other 44 states have an equalization program. So I don't think we're talking apples and apples here. And then finally had a question about the social workers. It was a recommended from the house of $5 million and we're just saying $266,000. Yes, sir. Curious about that? Sure. At the house they were looking at funding a social worker in various school systems. Under the QBE formula, we already fund a social worker based upon the number of students at each school. So this to us kind of looked like partial double dip. It's like if we're already funding a social worker based on the number of students you have headcount and QBE, why are we now being asked to fund it again? If you don't mind, I might take a little point of personal privilege on this one. That is the reason we really need to take a look at the QBE formula as a whole. Yes. Well, we might be looking at it for different reasons. I understand, but yes. Because we have given so many waivers of Title 20. I agree with me. There is no requirement anymore that local school systems follow the funding mechanism that we've laid out in QBE. QBE is now a block grant, not very different from what we do block granting money to regions. Now there's two systems that still don't have those waivers to Title 20. But we have 181 systems, only two have to follow the state's funding mechanism. That means the money that we put into Pre-K could be used in high school. Well, Pre-School and High, we use in kindergarten could be used in high school. That's probably a little bit better. Because Pre-K is slightly separate. But that means the dollars that you think as a policymaker, you're placing into certain categories. They don't have to flow there for 179 out of the 181 districts. Well, Mr. Chairman, it may surprise you that I do agree with you. So I look forward to working with you on that. Thank you. We're going to send in from 36. Thank you, Mr. President. This is Chairman of Appropriations. Yes, ma'am. I wanted to raise a couple of points. And I'm sure it's fair to say that there are things in this. Everybody finds something in this budget that they like. And everybody finds something in this budget that they would do differently. That's probably a pretty fair statement to make. And on one count, the situation that we are facing and it's been widely observed and tackled from a number of different ways, is homelessness and mentally, ill-crownically, mentally, ill people in the streets. And Atlanta is a big receptacle for that. It seems pervasive and obvious and the city works on it all the time. And this budget does not put money in for mercy care and partners for home that has been in the budget before. It's a false short of what the Chamber has asked for, the city has asked for. And so that, we all come to this great city and do our work here. And so we're keenly aware of the problems that we face. And so that would be one that I would hope we could do some, you know, in the conference committee, we can work out between the House and the Senate to see those needs addressed. You want me to address that one first? Yes, thank you. Thank you for the question. And as you know, we added funds for housing and homelessness last year in the budget. That's right. We asked for some accountability as to how those spending had been doled out. And we're unable to get some answers. So, you know, we've got a couple of more hours I'm sure before we head to a conference committee. So maybe someone will be able to provide us some answers on how that money was spent. If that money was not spent in a way and a measure that we feel is the intention of this body, I think as stewards of taxpayer funds, we have a duty to remove those from the budget. Thank you for that. And then another, I think, important thing that we did in this budget is really ramp up our commitment to our retirees and funding that was added. I think the House had 25 million and we added 50 million more, is that right? Roughly, yes, ma'am. Roughly, yeah, roughly. That, I'm sure, will be a discussion for the House and where their priorities are in conflict. But I wanted to appreciate and applaud that everyone part here in this budget. Thank you. Thank you. Bring it on to Senator from the 52nd. Thank you, Mr. President. Well, the Senator yielded. Yes, sir. We appreciate our appropriations, Chair, and I appreciate this information being on the front page. Isn't it true that you and I and others in the finance committee had passed a bill last year that was going to list all of these. However, we were told that it was impractical to put 200 additional pages into the budget. And so I appreciate the top 11 being on here in lieu of the 200 pages of all the credits. And isn't it also true that the Senator from the 53rd had suggested a study committee on eliminating the income tax and based on this information, couldn't we do this in one meeting in about 30 minutes? What do you know? I did the work of the Senator from the 53rd Forum. Actually, I can't take credit from that. The Senate budget office was very involved. Thanks again for your hard work on this. One more question, Senator. We're going to have Senator from the 35th. Does the gentleman, you? Yes, sir. Just to piggyback off the previous question about the QB poverty weight. Understand the concerns around QB. And I share it in those concerns. I think it's time to update the formula. I just want to make sure that when we talk about, isn't it right that when we talk about equalization? And if it's a county like Winnett, for example, they received, according to their website, in 2024, $88.7 million. But QB has this funky thing called local fair share. Local five, Milcher. Right. Where they had to pay in to QB $224 million. I don't think it's funky. But what we recognize is that education funding in Georgia is a local and state partnership. You may not know this, but in the state constitution, the education of our youth is a constitutional provision protected in Georgia's constitution. So to get to the 20% funding level, we view that. It's actually been the Georgia Spring Court. Actually, it may have been to the US Supreme Court. I have to check back on who gave this opinion. Georgia's funding formula was found constitutional. I think it's the only one that was, which leaves the state funding roughly 80% of education in K-12 level and the local's funding 20. And that was on the QBE formula. About 30 years ago. I don't think the Supreme Court changed their precedent on it. Well, no, I'm just, isn't it true that today, Georgia, the state does not fund 80%. Oh, no, in the QBE formula, yes, sir, we still do. We've got it. We're actually required to. Not education generally, though. You're right. The local property taxes have gone out of control. And usually most people's local property taxes over 50% of it goes to the education entity as well. And isn't it true that the majority of education, public school education funding comes from those property taxes? But I do not know. I think that's district by district. Down my way, the majority of the funding is still, I believe, state funded. What is the gentleman for the yield? Yes, sir. What are we doing in this budget to prepare for the ongoing cuts to federal dollars? Several different areas where I see federal grants and federal funding that we're relying on in this budget. What are we doing to prepare for those cuts that some of which have already been announced, but specifically around health care? Yeah. Well, let's talk about that. First, I think Georgia is in a better position than most states related to any federal spending change because we did not at Span Medicaid early on. The deal told us that if we were at Span Medicaid, one day that 90% care that was laid out by the feds would one day be reduced. And turns out we didn't know it would be eight years after he was out of office, but it looks like he may be right on that. So Georgia is in a better position than most states because we didn't take the federal care at the time. As far as our Medicaid spending right now, I'm not aware of any change. I've heard proposals, but I'm not aware of any changes that have already been approved to change any F-MAP at the state level. If there is an F-MAP change, I want to be fully transparent to you. It would mean a change to the state budget, even a tenth of a percent change is probably tens of millions in dollar changes. But thankfully, since we have not taken the urge of others to spend everything that we have in our surplus, the state stands in a position not only from our surplus standing, but also from a position of taking a fiscal conservative approach even in this budget that we should be able to withstand anything I think we would see from the feds. Thank you. Yes, sir. Thank you very much. Thank you so much again for allowing me to present the budget to you. I really appreciate your thorough questions. You've been so involved in this process, and it means a lot to me, and it means a lot to the subcommittee chairs who also help you get us to this point. Ask for your favorable consideration of the Senate Committee's substitute to House Bill 68. All right. Good job, Senator. Good job. I see we have a number of House members with us today, and they're creating quite a bit of chatter back there in the back. I know you're used to wild, unorderedly chambers. We don't, we don't participate in that. The only one that can get out of order is my ag chairman back there, Robert Dickie. He's only going to get out of order. All right. I recognize Senator from the first. Thank you, Mr. President. I'll be brief. I just wanted to highlight one section of the budget and give you a little bit of historical perspective. When I say history, I'm talking about just back to 2011, when Governor Diel said in his first state of the state address that he wanted to increase the number of residents. He said he wanted to increase the number of residency spots by 400. And the reason he did that is because we were 39th in physician to population. So of all the states 39th and our joining states, including South Carolina, was had a much better ratio of physician to population. More than 400 residency spots. And let's fast forward to 20, 25th. So guess what? We are now 41st. So we've gotten a little bit worse from 39 to 41st and even in sub specialties. We're in the mid 40s when it comes to sub specialist to population. And this is compared to all 50 states. And again, surrounding states, because of our population growth has changed that. So in this budget, we have challenged those who are responsible for residency spots in the state of Georgia. Mostly hospitals, though in a couple of situations like with MCG and more house, they actually hold the spots and the hospitals reimburse them for those spots. So we are attacking this issue in multiple ways. You'll see that in the past the amended budget, we did seed money. In this budget, we've done actual slots of 150 and more relating to naive. So we have naive programs that can do it from a Medicare standpoint. We have established programs who can fund it themselves. We have also established programs that can do draw downs relating to Medicaid. And we've encouraged the hospitals in general to use the workforce development funds that they get from DPP, a directed payment program, so that we do not have to write a a dendum to the DPP program through DCH in Washington. But we may have to consider that next year if we do that. So what I'm saying is that by teamwork, we're addressing this issue in the amended budget and in this big budget, because of population growth from 2011, in which we were 39th in primary care physicians relating to population, to now a population of 11 million in which we, the ratio actually has gotten a little bit worse. But having said that, I'm optimistic. We'll continue to work on this in the future, work in conjunction with them, and we'll stress some teamwork related to that. Thank you, Mr. President, I'll yield the well. Great. I have the senator for the 29th. Thank you, Mr. President. There's a truth and an untruth floating around the chamber. The untruth is that I don't love the senator from the 29th, I mean from the 19th. And that is not true. I do. He is a good friend and a long time friend, and he and his incredible staff have done a great job on this budget. His seatmate says I don't like Elmo. That may be true. But my concern about the budget and the process that went through the budget is I watched the struggle and the fight and the energy put in by the senator from the 19th and his staff, and I appreciate it every minute of it. But we still have things in this budget that do not belong in this budget. And one of those is our continued funding of Georgia Public Broadcasting. And I appreciate and I'll quote the O my goodness from the senator from the 36th, because O my goodness, no other media source asks us to fund them. I've yet to see a letter from the AJC or any other media source asking for citizens tax dollars being used to support them. And that's all I'm saying. Citizens tax dollars should not be used to fund public broadcasting. It is not the responsibility of government to pay citizens tax dollars to promote. Media it is not our citizens responsibility. I will be voting for this budget because of the impact it makes in Georgia Department of Corrections. The way it takes care of our prisons, the men and women that work there and the people we are responsible for housing and the many, many, many other things that we're responsible for doing and taking care of. But at some point I do ask those that will be in conference committee to consider cutting out the waste, especially when it comes to us funding media sources that currently go outside and find private sector sponsors that they advertise on the radio and television. And with that Mr. Chair, with that Mr. President, I yield the well. Thank you Senator. Recognize the senator from the 22nd. Thank you Mr. President. I'll be brief. I want to thank the senator from the 19th. Obviously the Senate Budget Office of Properation Committee and also staff for the hard work on this particular legislation as we know staff is so important. It's always to make sure we thank them. Look at this budget obviously there are some things in here which are very good. And the question becomes, are we actually do more to it? Can we actually make it better? Can we actually make some changes to it and invest in our people and also in our children which is obviously very important. And that is the key. We all can come together and realize that it's our children and our people that makes Georgia great. And there are two issues that are still off there that this budget actually could meet that we're right now woefully and adequately meeting. For instance the budget funds 21,000 promised scholarships. These scholarships will take money out of the public schools. It will harm public education. There's no doubt about this because we've seen other states such as Arizona where a lot of these scholarships have blown their budget. We'll be frankling better off actually using this money for what we call the CAPS program. Using this money to actually fully fund our education, public education is the key to assist families and their desire to actually educate their children. One of the keys that this is, I was just kind of thinking about this yesterday when we did SB 268. SB 268 actually tells us that we now want to have a record of a kid when he goes from one school to the other. So that the other school can actually understand what his total record is. Which means what you're really looking at is that you want to school to understand what the total root causes of this child is. It's not a good idea. But when you start talking about the promised scholarship and going to private institutions, it forgets something. That the children that they're just supposed to be taking in, they have root causes of a lot of the issues that they have. A lot of these schools, which are quote unquote failing, they live in high poverty areas. They live in high crime areas. So all of these kids, most of these kids have real root cause issues that are causing the issues that are preventing them from actually learning and studying. And just because we slap on the word private to an institution is not going to make that institution any better and actually educating that child without making sure we deal with issues such as poverty. Without making sure we deal with issues, we deal with crime. So the fact that we're going to move this money and just say now it goes to a private place and all of a sudden magically these children are going to be educated better. It's certainly a misnomer. So we can do better within that particular area. Also, we start talking about our people. Our people are still out there who need help, especially who suffer from Hurricane Helene. That is obviously a big issue that still exists in my particular district and many others. Many people are still suffering because of that particular hurricane. I remember coming here to actually speak at the senator's from the 28th. She had a panel discussion on voting rights because it's something that's very unique to her and something she's very interested in. And I had to come up here to speak for 30 minutes. I'd leave my district for 30 minutes and I came up here and spoke because she asked me to do that. And I remember seeing the senator from 26 and he said, is y'all power out or something in the gus? And I said no, it's a lot more than that. It was tremendous devastation that took place. And that happened all over our state. And we can do better. We've tried to work through that with a minted budget but understand that we can do better with that. And so when I left here that day to go back home, I actually was leaving electricity here. I was actually leaving the air condition and going back to a place with no gas. No one had any power. Food services weren't opening and my task for that day would be to stand in the food service line and help people actually eat. That was huge for all communities in the state. So we can do better. We can do better as far as how we actually educate our children and we can do better how we actually fund our people and take care of our people. And here's the thing. There are some good provisions in this budget. There's no doubt about that. And the question becomes, do we have a positive affirmation and say we believe that this committee can do better. Or do we have a negative affirmation? I'm going to vote today yes because I believe that this committee believes in Georgia's children and believes in the people of this state. And we will actually make this budget better. That is my hope Mr. President. With that, I yield well. Seniors yielded. We're going to have a center from the seventh.

Thank you, Mr. President. Today, I rise to speak on behalf of the students who are being left behind by this budget. I will be voting no today. We say all the time that a budget is a moral document. And if that's true, then this one neglects our children. This budget slashes $75.6 million from our Department of Education, including nearly 20 million cut from mental health support grants, and 28 million stripped from efforts to address poverty in our schools. We are cutting programs that help kids who are struggling emotionally, economically, and academically, at a time when they need us most. And for what? So that we can spend $141 million on private school vouchers? Let's call what this is. A transfer of public money into private hands. With no accountability, no transparency, and no guarantee that the kids who need the help the most will get any of it. These are not investments in students. They're subsidies for systems that get to pick and choose who they educate. Systems that don't serve students with disabilities. They don't serve English language learners. They don't serve the majority of Georgia's children. I did not come to this chamber to help some kids at the expense of others. I came here to fight for all of them, especially the ones that public education was designed to serve. So I asked, what message are we sending when we gut mental health support, but hand out vouchers like candy? What message are we sending when we slash funds meant to help school serving students in poverty? But right checks to schools that can turn kids away. This is not just bad policy. It's a betrayal of public education. And I urge my colleagues to reconsider and make this budget better. But today I'm voting no. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the well. Thank you, Senator. Any other senator would speak for against measure? Senator from the 19th. You can close the debate. Appreciate the comments, and I respect many of them. But I do think I have to reply to a few points. Cutting $75.9 million out of education? Well, that's simply not true. We reduced the house increase by $75.9 million perhaps. But at what point in time have we gotten to a place in our budget where a reduction of an increase is a cut? Welcome back to reality, gentlemen, ladies. That is not what happened. Vouchers. Why are we supporting a voucher program? The next word that came out was accountability. Let's talk about accountability. Give me your answer to why we now consider 50% of a class reading on grade level good. Where's the accountability for that? We are cheering mediocrity. The reason we support a voucher program is because kids have to be given an ability to do something better. Their parents have to be given options to take their kids somewhere else. Why? Because we have failed them on accountability. Cutting mental health. Our DVHDD budget has increased 25% in five years. That's another example of a decrease of an increase added by the other chamber being called a cut. If you leave this room and someone who's paid to be in the halls tells you that you cut their budget. If you want to get a budget, you can ask them what they did last year. Please ask them what public school they went to and if they would have liked to try their option at one of our voucher programs. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the well. Good job, Senator. Good job to all your staff and everybody who helped you put this budget together. I know you worked very hard on putting it together. Let's get the center of the 19th round of applause for all the hard work that he's there right there. Good job. The question is on the adoption of the committee's substitute. Is there an objection to the board of the committee which is favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair here is none. Is there an objection to the main question being ordered? The question is on the passage of the bill by substitute all those in favor of the bill. All the passes of the bill, the yeas are 48, the nays are 7. This bill hammered to see the requisite constitution of the majority is therefore passed by substitute. Mr. President, we do have lunch served in the anti-room. It's breakfast for lunch so that's hopefully not an indication of how long we're going to go today. But it's ready and so depending on what you do, Mr. President, if we're going to keep rolling then just want folks to know the food is there and ready. Thank you. We're going to keep rolling and play. But I know but y'all are welcome to go into the anti-room and go in between votes here. So I think most folks will probably want to get one to get home this afternoon. But thank you, Mr. Protein, for that announcement. Secretary Reed, House Bill 85. House Bill 85 will represent a lover of the 123 others. The bill is between 109 to men on 1, chapter 6, title 15 of the official court of Georgia. Anitated by the two general provisions concerning the period court system modified provisions regarding the compensation received by the period court judges to amend code section 45-7-4 of the OCEGA. We'll do annual salaries of certain state officials and cost of living adjustments. So as the revised provisions, we'll do high-cutting and setting the salaries of the period court judges. So I for definition to end chapter 3 title one of the OCEGA will to laws and statues. Festive spend the operation of local laws and local ordinances or resolutions. They use a superior course, Georgia salary for the calculation of the salary, the compensation of other officers, official to employees. So I for short title to buy for an effective date to arrive for related matters for vehicle-viving laws and for other purposes. Mr. President of the Senate Committee on Judiciary recommends that this bill do pass respect please minutes and restrict them chairman. Mr. President of the Senate or Lucas of the twenty-six and others are with following amendment number one to amend House Bill 85 by inserting after judges on line 14 members of the general assembly by inserting after line one six of the following section 5.1. So code section is further amended by advising the introductory language to paragraph 22 of subsection A and for other purposes. Mr. President that completes the order. Recognize the senator from the fiftyth speak to the measure. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I rise to bring House Bill 85. This is the third piece of the legislative pay bill or compensation bill that we've been working on the third one that I brought you. The first one we did we passed the last week that raised the superior court judge's salaries age from 60 to 65. Yesterday we did the appellate judges today this deals with superior court judges and it really this conversation started several years ago. And I want to give a shout out to presiding justice Nell's Peterson judge Harris judge weaver and all of those that came together to the table to really fine tune this and and come up with a good solution also want to pause and give a shout out to the late judge Rusty Smith who was who passed away earlier this year from the mountain judicial circuit who also played a huge role in this. There is discrepancy and pay across the state with superior court judges we have some judges that are in the top eight percentile of judges pay we have some in the bottom 99th percentile. And what this does is it creates parity across the state it takes the burden off the local local counties to pay their judges and it puts it on the state. What this does is it allows us to appropriate how much the superior court judge is going to make it puts a cap on the salary that we're allowed to appropriate to them and that is 90 percent of what a US district judge in the northern circuit makes. Mr. President there is an amendment I strongly oppose any amendment to this bill I understand the the passion and why some in this chamber feel the need but like I said in the very beginning this has been a years long process and addressing the pay of people in the public service needs to be more transparent than an amendment on a floor on day 37 at the end of of this session I would encourage anybody supporting that amendment. So let's not railroad this important piece of legislation by adding this let's let's do it right if you want to if you want to change your pay then you got to do it drop a bill have a study committee do something that but I would just ask that we oppose amendment one or any other amendments to this because this bill has been a very carefully crafted piece of legislation if we send it back to the house it will receive final passes and I'm happy to answer any questions Mr. President. You do have one question we're going to send it from the forty first. Thank you Mr. President. Mr. Senator you can you just break this down for us is a lot of words here in short how much of a raise would superior court judges be receiving upon average can you give me a dollar figure for how much of a raise we're talking about. Well there's a huge disparity between how much judges across the state are getting paid some judges if they were to opt into the system would actually see a pay decrease based on local supplements that are provided and some could get a pay increase as much as 30% but what it does is it takes it off of the locals that are paying the supplements and it does give it to the state because superior court judges are state employees they're not county employees. Deeper the you I do isn't it true that there's a provision in here that ensures that the judges that represent my county will not take a pay decrease should they opt into the system. I know that you know yes the center knows what she speaks. Do you further you know I do so just so I'm clear though if you're saying that for some judges this will be about a 30% increase is that measure out to be about about eighty thousand dollar pay increase for judges some judges on the state's back is that not true. I don't think there's any judge that would increase by that much I think it would be more fifty to sixty thousand dollar range but ultimately what this is doing is it's creating parity and if we were if we were to set it at the maximum which is what I'm what you're assuming if we were to set it at the maximum then yes it could and but it's going to be us up to us to set it number one and number two if we do set it to the maximum it only puts Georgia it doesn't put Georgia at the top of the country. We would be we would rank 14th in judges pay. Thank you. We're going to have the Senate run the 19th. Thank you, Mr. President. Senator you'll I do. Senator is it not true that I have been very critical of this bill and some more proposals over the past few years. I think very critical almost categorizes it yes. Thank you. Is it not that being said with the senator further you I will is it not true that we have worked very hard on some retirement pieces to all help offset the cost increase of this bill. Yes and I want to honestly I want to commend you for the work that you've done not just last session but in the interim and this session to get us where we are here and I think you helped the legislation get to this point and hopefully we'll be able to support it because it means a lot and we want to thank you for all that you've done to help support this. Will you yield for a few more questions. So in that vein is it not true that we are actually on a separate bill in order to help offset the cost of this bill raising the retirement of our judges by a significant portion. That's right we passed that last week it was we were raising it from 60 to 65 to bring them a parody with the apologize because nobody else was retiring at 60 anyway correct. Would the center for the deal I will is it not true that I also requested that there be a balance in a leveling off that every superior court judge in Georgia since they're all superior court judges make the same exact pay whether they're in hey hire or house in county or working in Cobb County. I will does this bill calls that local calls that leveling out of judges who are on equal level with the state constitution to now be on a legal equal level on pay in our state does. Will the center you'll further I will there has been as you know last year in order to accomplish this I requested that it be done on a constitutional amendment. Is it not true that the opinion that has been given to us and the legislative intent of what we're passing now is to make sure that this general bill supersedes any local bill that would later be dropped considered by this body considered by the house that would raise or calls any locality pay to be created for any singular judge or any singular judicial circuit. I will since I'm a lawyer and I said the word singular I have to ask you this is it not true that the intention of this general bill is also to occupy the field so that no local bill that would be from multiple superior court districts could be dropped to raise their pay around what this general bill already sets. Thank you. No more courses. Thank you, Mr. President. Does any other senator who would speak for against the measure. Senator from the 26th you like to come speak to your amendment. Thank you, Mr. President. You know a lot of you are very fortunate. I said in the general assembly with the lieutenant governor's dad. And I think he was in the petroleum business driving trucks. I think he went to night law school like I did. But I got tired of going to the hotel room studying everybody else having fun. So I just decided to leave night law school. His dad went old and finished. And he's built one heck of an empire. And of course the lieutenant governor has been in the city. Now I've served longer than any of you in here. I started age 24 right out of college. Plants in my proof football after I got cut from the scans. I had a dream to make some of that big money. Where the super fly coach, the big hatch with feathers hanging out of it. So that folks could notice me when I came home. But let me tell you what you're all forget about. The judge bill is not being passed by the judge. It's been passed by members of the general assembly. We do the work. And yet we seem to be scared. Scared. You are worth it. We're the lowest paid, some of the lowest paid legislators in the country. The amount of bomb makes 50,000. And guess what? You can work for the universal system of Alabama. You can't do it and join. If you're in the legislature, you cannot wait for the universal system. A bunch of you are going to vote against it and hope it pays. A bunch of you are going to vote against it and hope it passes. Because you won't. But you scared to vote for it. When I've told all of you in here what the state needs to does is go and build a sausage factory. This is sausage. We mix it up. We grind it up. And then we put a wrap on it. I understand you make a good one every night. If I'd have finished law school, I'd have made the first thing I'd done. Go buy me a big cat lag. Dress shop and go and court. And then get locked up. So I can get me some customers. That's right. If they see you in court and you fight for them, you go to jail for them. Everybody's not going to do it. But listen. When I was twenty four, I came to general assembly. I made like seven to one hundred dollars. We didn't have expense accounts. Stuff like that. But you mean something to the people of the state. How many of you get a phone call from a constituent who's tried to get some help from a state department and one able to get it? They call you and then you intercede it and they got to help them. You need to stop being scared. If you scared, say you scared when you run a false. That would you do. Say you're scared. And then the folks are no naughty like you. It's all about the money. It's all about everything we do is up here. It's about money. And so what you need to do is stick about it. I look at those who will follow me. The son is said. What you realize is that you got to have folks coming up here. Who have the skills. Who work for the people. They need to get paid. I went to school in Alabama. College. And they make 50,000 dollars. 50,000. That means they do work. They can go to work. And not have to worry about how they're going to make it. You know it's a sacrifice coming up here. You get up in the morning. I don't do a child. I used to stay in the hotel back when I was young. Back when I was young. I started putting ladies. And I smiled. Sometimes I even sang to them. I've got no them. And why? I drive back before everything. I smile that's me. Look. I got an extra room. You can stay over there. I said no. I'd rather go back home. And get in my own bed. I never would forget. Why have I answered the phone? And somebody said, well, I know where your husband is. She said, wow. She said right here. So my wife said, tell me bring the babies some milk home. Let me tell you something. There's no better sacrifice in trying to represent people and be a voice for them when they need to have a voice. But you really ought to think about it. Paying yourself to work. It's not a 40 day job. It's all year. You get calls about stuff that we don't even deal with. And then you try to help them. Try to find the right resources for them to get the help they need. This is making sauce. And the state ought to open up a sauce in fact, because we do it all the time. When you talk about legislators having four year turns, set it. I'll tell you right quick, it ain't going to happen. The news media is not going to lie to you to get a four year turn because they're going to lose the money on every time. But again, I said to some of you, you're fortunate. You're doing good. Some of you have retired. Made a good salary. They got a good pension. Outside of the state pension. I didn't know how long I was going to be here. Speaker told me one day said, boy, I said, what? Well, someone I don't mean it like that. But it seemed like you might be here while put yourself in the phone 57 plan. You ain't going to miss it. And I did it. I didn't know I was going to be here 50 years ago. My dream was to be on the channel of it as an interview about it. I was thinking. But after four years, I got my degree so I could do something else. So what I said to you is stop being scared that other folks tell you what you ought not to have. You wait for them. You deserve it. But again, I said to you, if you're scared, tell the folks you're scared. So there are no not to eat like you. Are you in the way? No. All right. Should have had you for a devotion this morning. I'm going to ask Senator from the 36.

I'm the second signer on this amendment and I'd like to share a couple of thoughts with you as we move rapidly on through our agenda for the day Paying a decent salary to elected officials is good public policy and Here's why If the only people that can a full all if only people who can't afford to serve by the fact of Having a handsome pension or being independently wealthy or having a spouse that brings in a great income You're limiting it. You're limiting public service to a very narrow strata of our population a very narrow strata of our population Folks those folks have to work for a living without doubt unless they are in doubt in some way with a with the family money or Have had a very lucrative career. So who do we want? serving and making policy shaping the course That our state takes shaping what we do for our families for hard work in Georgians. I Say to you is it not preferable to have a broadly representative Body of legislators up here under the gold dome. I say the answer. Yes Have have have a rich have a rich life experience. I mean we've got we've got Well, you know some some some some great life experience in this chamber no question about it I can start calling names and who who who who fixed hands for for a living for a long time? Who did this that another who served? And it's important legal cases or who is in business who you know who who we got a mix, but it is it is not reflective in terms of the income levels as long as you keep these artificially low But we get $50 a month for our pension for every year we served y'all added that up lately Not an attractive Benefit package that's for sure So what we're doing with keeping this very depressed levels of compensation for serving here is we're limiting Who can choose this career path and that means that our legislature our policy makers our committee chairs our leadership in both chambers is Highly limited to folks that can afford it or who? Just so used to starving they want to keep on starving come up here and do public services and still not have any money But if we paid a decent compensation we brought in the pool of Georgians that can choose to come and be a part of our deliberative bodies and I say We get better policy that way so I'm strongly in favor of this I didn't like the colorful speaker that we just heard from I didn't plan to stay this long either Senator didn't know when I started and Still hard to believe I came in the 80s Senator you just heard from came in the 70s and I guess then the next crowd came in the 90s We've got a couple of them here with us ding from the 15 But we could do this and other other legislatures have done it and Reach back in your pocket and pull out that that courage vote wisdom justice moderation and courage And show a little courage on voting for a Living wage being paid to our legislators. Thank you. I yield the well Thank you Senator Recognize the senator from the 53rd It's interesting if you scared say you're scared. I'm here to tell you I'm not scared. I'm gonna vote for the amendment But I tell you what I think some of you are afraid that if we raise the salaries you're gonna have a little competition come next election Because everyday people are gonna say hey maybe I can afford to be a legislator So you wealthy Republicans think twice about vote no on this Because it could Could save your seat because if you vote green you're gonna have everyday Georgians more willing to come to this capital and serve I mean you'd like to look at all the occupations that are represented in this room And it's heavily weighted to those that are retired and those who are attorneys and those who are big bankers There aren't too many truck drivers and auctioneers represented in the legislature I'll be voting for the amendment Mr. President. I'll be glad to thank you Senator from the 50th Center from 53rd was riding that Cadillac Senator 26 he said he didn't want to owes me bill he wants a Cadillac All right recognize the center from the 34th boy man now first year first year legislator Really Thank you, Mr. President colleagues. Yes, I'm the first time freshman But I am a 30 year Army veteran and I am super excited to serve all my 290 constituents and I am not a signer on that amendment but I do support it and the reason why I support it because I Do receive Medicaid and Medicare And I also receive so security But but by accepting this position I'll lose all of that So I was so I have lost half of my living wages Accepted in this role right now So but it's not about the money for me For running for this position What it was about it was about being there for my constituents my seniors my veterans And most importantly speaking up for the ones that didn't have a voice But when I went down to Social Security and explained to them that this is a part-time position Because I even asked what do y'all do after sessions over? Everyone said we go back to work I said well, I guess I need to find something to do But I just want to continue to be a voice for the voiceless continue to be the champion and Be down in my district but for The American everyday American citizens like myself The federal cuts for the veterans the federal cuts at the Social Security level that are about to happen Those cuts affect me So that's the reason why I want to support this amendment Because you know when I looked at my paycheck I only received a thousand dollars But it's not about the money Because I'm gonna continue to fight the good fight. Thank you. I think you have a question Senator But you welcome the other way if you want to I want a question. Senator from the 41st Thank you, Mr. President. Senator you yield I do Senator isn't it true that you served this nation honorably for 30 years in our nation's military That's correct and isn't true that you only left the military as they were being fully 100% Disabled or having as the percentage of disability that's why you left the military Yes, I was injured in combat. There was a reason why I was Unabried discharged so isn't it true that you were injured harmed that your body experienced some type of trauma on behalf of us The people of the United States the people of Georgia you did that on our behalf isn't it true? That is correct and isn't it further true that as a result of that you were entitled to certain benefits and included social Social Security disability is that not true? That is correct Is it not further true that as a result of you answering the call to come and serve in this great gold dome? You had to succeed yield those benefits in order to come here and receive less pay that is correct Thank you for your service. Thank you Seniors yielding recognize from the 55 Thank you, Mr President It has been said But I just want to reiterate Most of the people in this August body are in fact millionaires or retired Ordinarily your families are independently wealthy Now the average person cannot afford to come here I To I lose a lot of money here But like the colleague that came before me. It's not about the money for me and that's something my late wife Talked about how much money we were losing In fact when I got out of here 14 years ago and I think when you become 60 whatever whenever you can become Get the pension It was only $300 and I said what the heck am I going to do with $300? So I didn't even apply I just applied for it after my wife who died about a year and a half ago Because she was always saying I can take that $300 and do something with it But it is appalling that if you leave this this place after serving and I served ten years But some of you if you serve 50 years you still gonna get Peanuts But the quality you know you say diversity doesn't matter I really I really Cherish here in the opinions of some of you from the various backgrounds because you enrich my life And we need some truck drivers down here as my English colleague states we need someone else down here because guys Some people have never gone through the grocery store They have other people going to buy it for them They do not understand regular people and I must simply state to you That I do have some friends in other states that served and I left this body for it for 14 years and people said to me Are you crazy going back to that legislature? And it would appear that but again, it's not about the money But I'm not here for me. I'm here for the future Of Georgia the future of democracy so that there were other voices to let you know what it is like to choose between drugs According whether you can pay for drugs or whether you can buy Groceries whether you have the medicine that supplies that's good for your body to keep you living There are some people that have those kind of choices and I would dare say no one in here knows anything about that You know not how to choose whether to pay the first bill To pay to pay Peter and Rob Paul you just don't understand and that's not an indictment against you, but it's all because To come here. I was in I was a town hall meeting this past week and I asked the people in that room How much do you think my staff? How much do you think my staff budget is to do the business of the people? I guarantee you not one of you can tell me what those people said some said 75,000 Some said everyone was no one said seven thousand dollars for an entire year for my budget for expensive to run the people's business for a forty billion dollar Enterprise the people who are running it Are supposed to be paid pennies so I move stand down because According to the National Conference of State legislators the average is 44,320 dollars We have for that guys New York legislators make one forty two thousand Texas go check out Texas. That's a very conservative jurisdiction They have staff Even if your politics is to do it's a not fun those poverty people children and poverty and the fun other people get the staff To do your duty. I Need the staff to do my duty. All right. You laugh at me some of you laugh at me because I have something to volunteer Hey, it's ridiculous But we have to do the people's business. So I simply say that We don't need all rich people down here. We just don't And it shouldn't be an attorney I take a pay cut come down here And there's some people to say man, I'm what is wrong with you But someone has to stand in the gap and say The The least the lost and the left out need a voice and I simply say that my brothers and my sisters my distinguished colleagues I Talked yesterday but Someone needs to talk about other industries other than private prison to be funded Because you see nothing wrong with it. Why can't we find some industry for coffee county? Making batteries Making something that is useful Rather than planning using third grade numbers to plan how many private prisons we're going to be Someone needs to talk about that. You see nothing wrong with it. That's the problem and extims from Regular people need to be here And I love all you guys because you do enrich my life But I would stand to say today That I will vote for this amendment because not for me, but I want someone else Who can stand here? Who doesn't drive a Mercedes-Benz? Who does not drive a $75,000 car? Who does not live on a half million dollar house? And I know some of you laugh at me and say well, I don't live that way Thank you for listening to me Thank you for allowing me to serve in this place just even for a moment and Thank you for your vote in favor of this amendment. Thank you, sir Thank you, Mr. President Senator Henshield and recognize senator of the 13th We need we got about one more speaker. We need to go and wrap this up. It's pretty this is pretty simple. It's a red-to-green vote here All right, we're talking about money. We're talking about salaries and after agreement the center true of 26 that was an incredible Layout of how we need to be doing our world appear. I appreciate it. We had to say I'll tell you how I feel about got boys girls. Here's the deal We work for 11 million people We don't just work for the 200,000 we work for 11 million people and if 11 million people want us to have a raise And I suggest what we might do is come back here next year and we do a cost to the amendment to put it on the ballot and set those 11 million people Want to give us a raise and that way we don't have to worry about it when we go home We ain't got to be scared we ain't got to be anything except the reality of it is we let the people decide Mr. President Hey, where'd you come from? Best thing I've heard you say all session recognize center from the 18th Thank you, Mr. President So we've got an interesting proposition in front of us I want to speak to the amendment first, but I have to say that this may be a historic day from the comments of center from the 50th Third said he's gonna vote yes We may see a green by his name for the first time ever. We didn't think the button worked So that would be good. We would know that it works But I rise to oppose amendment number one Similar to the amendment that we voted on that was presented in past yesterday I wanted you urge you to stop a minute Take a step back and consider how this amendment looks to the taxpayers of this state Think about the timing of where we are Think about what we've gone through in the budgeting process We have spent the last two months while we've been down here working cutting red tape lowering income taxes and Prioritizing necessary disaster relief assistance for the people around Georgia Colleagues are you willing to look at your constituents in the eye and tell them you need more of their tax dollars in your pocket and out of their pocket Because I can promise you that's how they view it They view us as part-time legislators and notwithstanding some of the great comments that some of you have made Yeah, this is not just a three-month job But I kind of knew that or knew enough about that when I Signed up to do the job or hope that I would get to do the job. I Kind of believe most of y'all did too Don't get me wrong the work that we do down here is necessary. It's important. It's critical for state government But each one of us chose to run through this position knowing what it pays Every one of you did and I did too We put our name on the dotted line with an idea and telling our constituents or our potential constituents That we wanted to what we wanted to serve them Not get hired by them not get paid by them, but we wanted to serve them Not one penny more should go into our pockets When it comes from the pockets of the people that send us here We are I think foremost public servants I Think that's the attitude and I want to accord everyone good intentions Regardless of what side of the aisle you're on that that's why you come down here Contrary to the comments the center from the 36 said wait a minute. We need more money earlier on so people can make a career out of this I would tell you that's not what we're supposed to be viewing this as a career Some have some have done a great job of public service, but if you came down here to make a career out of it You might not reexamine your process And I would also tell my members on my side of the aisle if you call yourself a fiscal conservative you should oppose this amendment Senators I urge you to oppose this let's keep the main thing The main thing why we came down here to serve Let's put service above self Now regardless of those reasonings There's another really big overriding reason you need to vote this amendment down If this amendment goes on this judicial pay raise bill House bill 85 It will kill the bill It will kill the judicial pay raise bill Center from the 50th. Thank you for your good work on this You and others have been working for three years With the judges to try to come up with a program and this has been truly carefully crafted by working with the judges You've done a great job on that Folks if you want to talk to some people that truly probably you would agree need to make more Go talk to your judges Because we are having problems right now in the superior court ranks of our state In having people actually qualify to run or sit as judges And it's because the amount of the pay has gotten out of whack and out of balance with not only the market But the ability of judges to earn a living at a level That they can continue to live something of a comfortable life Relative to what they can earn otherwise So I would ask you please don't jeopardize the three years of work That is going on and trying to get HB85 to the point that it is now Which is is a good bill with good metrics That the judiciary is pleased with would they like more money? Of course they would Would we like to pay less for most any state expense? Of course we would But that's the judgment that we enter in trying to find the right balance And I would tell you that House Bill 85 finds that balance And the last thing I would tell you simply this If this legislature pay raise Bill is which ain't a bill it's an amendment was such a good idea Why was it not proposed as a bill for us to vote on as a bill to be dropped as a bill to go through committee as a bill to be vetted as a bill to be voted on It's not it wasn't And sadly it puts in jeopardy something that so many in this room want to see passed To make sure that we take care of folks that Exercise their judgment For people who truly are in need when they go to the courthouse to make sure we've got folks that are smart That have the tools necessary to preside over a court proceeding in a way that you would want managed and handled if it were your interest or your family's interest We need to make sure they're fairly paid House Bill 85 does that let's not jeopardize that let's get that bill passed Thank you mr.

I want to get my judges to raise when I want to. This bill ties my hands. I know the senator is passionate about what she speaks. On the passage of the bill, the yeas are 51 and the nays are two. This bill, Henry C. Rex, that constitutes the majority is therefore passed. Six-year-old Reed, House Bill 113. House Bill 113, by represent of McDonald, the 26th and others, Bill Spentan, act to amend Title 50 of the Fisher-Couroj-Jorgesan-A-Tay, Related to State Government, so as to prohibit the state or its agencies from purchasing goods from certain foreign countries or related to China, to arrive for powers of the Georgia Technology Authority, try for a later matter, ensure people can pay for the laws and other purposes. Mr. President, the Senate Committee on Government Oversight recommends this bill to pass by the substitute, which is roughly two minutes, and a harbored chairman. Mr. President, the Senate Committee on Government Oversight, I was following substitute to House Bill 113 to build the meantime, act to amend Title 50, the official cut of Georgia Anitato, Related to State Government, so as to prohibit the state or its agencies from purchasing goods from certain foreign countries or related entities, arrive for a list of such goods, arrive for penalties, to arrive for definitions, to repeal provisions, or I do contract any of China, to arrive for powers of the Georgia Technology Authority, to arrive for a later matter, ensure people can pay for the laws and other purposes. Mr. President, that completes the order. We're going to have the Senate from the 50th. Thank you, Mr. President. This has nothing to do with judicial pay. This is House Bill 113. This is a Governor's Administration Bill, and it will increase security of state purchasing process, ensuring protection of state infrastructure, and safety of our citizens in the face of growing cyber threats. This bill directs GTA to establish and keep updated a list of companies and products produced and or sold by citizens of governments of country designated as foreign adversaries by the U.S. Department of Commerce. State agencies will be prohibited from purchasing products or contracting with entities determined to be a security risk. GTA already works with federal authorities on flag technologies such as drones and Wi-Fi routers due to cybersecurity concerns. GTA is also asked to make it publicly available, so citizens and non-state agency entities can choose to be cyber secure as well with their personal and business devices. This bill expands current protections and existing code by expanding the countries that are on that list, increasing the penalty for violations and clarifying the role of DOAS and enforcement asked for your favorable consideration. And I yield the well. Does any other senator wish to speak for against the measure? Chair here's none. Is there objection to the previous question being the ordered, the chair here's none, the previous question is ordered. And the question is only adoption of the committee substitute, is there objection to the adoption of the committee substitute? Here none, the committee substitute is adopted. Is there objection to agree to the report a committee which is available to the passes of the bill? Chair here's none, the floor committee is agreed to. question is ordered. The question is on the pass of the bill by substitute all those in favor vote yay all pose nay secretary and lock the machine. All the passes of the bill the a's are 51 and a's are zero. This bill haven't received directs that counties was are zero for pass by substitute. Secretary read House bill 136. House 136, whether it's in a new one twenty-seven. There's a bill to be time back to men chapter seven. Title forty of the official Georgia and table. We do income taxes. So to expand the tax credit for contributions to foster child support organizations to lots of organizations to include qualified expenditures, reparent and mentorship services for justice and well-due to expand the reparent services that are qualified expenditures, offered tax credits to be used by certain insurance companies against insurance premium tax liability to ride for conditions of limitations, ride for reporting and public website requirements, ride for certifying and decertifying qualified organizations to ride for information sharing and limitations that are out of the two, ride for related matters, ride for effective date and applicability to avail convocating laws and for other purposes. Mr. President, the same can we end finance recommends that this bill do pass by substitute respect with minutes that are half-step alert chairman. Mr. President, thank you very much for finance, I was the long substitute to House Bill 136, bill's been counted at two minutes, chapter 7 title 40 of those CGA, I do income taxes, I do rising credit and new tax credits, related to children and for other purposes, Mr. President, that creates complete stewarder. We're going to have the Senate from 42nd, speak to the measure. Thank you, Mr. President, members of the Senate. With House Bill 136, we're combining two great efforts from this body, one that's been led, of course both these led by the Senate Governor, one led by the Senate from 6th. He's so excited about his sitting in seat right now watching this hopefully somewhere around. But this is our current tax credit that helps us invest in those children coming out of our foster care system and the bill expands who qualifies for that. It also adds now children coming out of our juvenile justice system as well. It adds to different services that can be paid for the tax credit that not just include our public universities but also vocational training, apprenticeships, private college, our state colleges. It also adds to the overall tax credit from $20 million to $30 million and finally doing all that we're also adding more accountability as to how the money is spent. What we're doing with this bill is allowing more George to keep more of their hard earned money and instead of paying it to the government, investing in these youth that need the help, need the help out of the system, they'll pull them up into society. The second part of this bill is Senate Bill 89, you passed earlier this session that came from our Senate Committee on Access to Affordable Child Care. A couple of tweaks to what we're doing here, we're still increasing it to a larger extent of the 50% of our current tax credit, 50% of the federal level, our current tax credit for certain expenses for child care, second we're creating a new tax credit for those with children or dependents over the age of six of $250. And finally, the biggest change that we did earlier instead of expanding our current tax credit for employers that offer child care for their workers, we are instead letting more employers take advantage of this and having a new credit for up to $1,000 per employee that businesses could pay for child care for their employees. It's something that will actually allow more of our employers in our state to take advantage of this. I just want to thank everyone that's worked so hard on these issues. We have a lot of things going on today, the course is session at this Capitol, but there are a few things that make a bigger impact for young people and working families in our state and what this bill does. Happy answering questions, Mr. President. You have no questions to ask for a favourable consideration. I'm breaking down as the Chair of the Finance, Senator from 52nd. Thank you, Mr. President. I'll be quick. We had asked for a fiscal note on this combined bill that passed this week. We have not received that fiscal note yet. So because of that and the combination of the two bills, you were handed out an additional fiscal note, the one for the Senate bill that Chairman Strickland had earlier and for the House bill. So you have to combine the two to get the true fiscal impact. The first one only had the very small part of it, and I thought it was not honest to just have that note out there. So with that, I'll yield the well, urge your favourable support of this bill. Does any of the Senator wish to speak for against the measure? Chair, here's none. Is there objections to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Questions on the adoption of the Committee? Substitute. Is there objections to the adoption of the Committee? Substitute. Hearing none, the Committee's substitute is adopted. Is there objection to agreeing to the Board Committee, which is able to pass the bill? Chair, here's none. The Board Committee has agreed to. Is there objections to the main question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The main question is ordered. The question is on the pass of the bill. By substitute, all those in favour. Well, yay, all opposed, nay, secretary, and locked them, machine. On the pass of the bill, the a's are 50, and the nays are zero. This bill, hammer, sees, recs that constitutions and majorities, therefore passed by substitute. Good job, Senator, from the 42nd. I appreciate all your hard work on that. Moving on now, the rules calendar. House bill 182. Secretary, please read the caption. House bill 182, by President Blumson of the 12th and others, bill 29 to amend chapter 25 of the 303. The official go to George Antiole to life insurance. Those that have a policy or group life insurance from excluding or restricting liability for certain deaths occurring while an individual is an active duty service member. It's a right for a late amount of time. In fact, the dates are paid with the bill and looking for other purposes. And the Senate Committee on Insurance and Labor recommends that this bill to pass by substitute. Respectfully submitted, Senator Walker, Chairman. Mr. President, the Senate Committee on Insurance and Labor officer, along substitutes to House bill 182, bill 29 to amend chapter 25 of the 303. Those CGA will be to life insurance, those that will prohibit a policy or group life insurance from excluding or restricting liability. There are certain deaths occurring while an individual is a service member, which is a right for a late amount of time. In fact, the dates are paid with the bill and looking for other purposes. Mr. President, that completes the order. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Chair recognizes the distinguished dean of the Senate, Senate from the 15th. Thank you, Mr. President. I certainly appreciate that. House bill 182 is simply Senate bill 109 that we passed out of here earlier so you probably remember that. It was a tragic incident that occurred in Columbus, Georgia involving one of my constituent sons. Sergeant Brandon Frazier was killed on a car accident. And that was some reluctance or refusal actually by the insurance company to not pay the premium that he had rightfully paid for for many years. The bill prohibits group life insurance policies from being delivered or issued in Georgia. If the policy contains a provision that excludes our restricts liability for death occurring while the insured is a service member or a regular member of the reserve of the United States Armed Forces. And the death is not a result of directly and directly a war declared on undeclared or any act or hazard of such war and simplest what it does. I appreciate your consideration and passes. If no question, this president, I yield well. You have no question, Senator. Does any other Senator wish to speak for or against the measure? The chair here is none. There's objection to the previous question being ordered. The chair here is none and the previous question is ordered. The question is on the adoption of the Senate, excuse me, the committee substitute is their objection to the adoption of the committee substitute. During non-the committee substitute is adopted. Is there objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which is favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none and the report of the committee has agreed to. Is there objection to the main question being ordered? The chair here is none and the main question is ordered. The question is now in the passage of the bill by substitute. All those in favor will vote yay, those opposed nay. Mr. Secretary, please unlock the machine. These are 46, the nasors zero. This bill having received the records of constitute from the majority is therefore passed. Mr. Secretary, let's move on down to House Bill 192. Please read the caption. House Bill 192, by represent of Gamble, the 15th and others, the bill is being titled act to amend Title 20, those CGA, white to education, so that's to include specific references. The programs included in the high demand career list published by the State Workforce Development Board with respect to the State Board of Education's and minimum courses of study. The required education for students in grade 6 through 12 to amend Chapter 14, Title 34, those CGA, white to state work, force development board, so that's to provide for evaluation methodology reports and purpose for short titles, why for late matters, should be able to look in laws and for other purposes. Mr. President, the Senate committee on the higher education recommends that this bill do pass. There's a faculty's minute, Senator Burns, chairman, and the committee's the order, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. The chair recognizes the senator from the 49th. Speak to his bill. Thank you, Mr. President. House bill 192, also known as the top state for talent bill. We'll build on the success of House bill 982, which created the state's high demand career list. The Georgia Match Program, which is the largest direct admissions program in the country, as well as work done by the joint study committee on dual enrollment for highly skilled talent at younger ages. I think the chairman from the sixth worked on that, so give him some credit there. To do this, the bill will reference the high demand career list and additional opportunities of code updating the previously passed bridge and connect acts and continue to align work source related code sections and incorporate all agencies that are performing this important work. The high demand career list will now be contemplated when it comes to the Department of Education's career education. List of industry credentials required by the Georgia employers created by the Department and TCSG and a grant program that will assist schools in reorienting their CTAE programs toward careers on that list. Some of you remember last year, Senate Bill 399, which created a report on articulation agreements between the university system and the technical college system that was brought to you by the previous senator from the 49th who is a whole lot smarter than the current. But now the Department of Education will also be brought to the table to report on their articulation agreements as well. Lastly, the Match Program will be mentioned in defining code for the first time at schools we'll need to implement the program in each student's individual college and career plan. I would encourage you guys to vote for a vote for this bill. It gives our students across the state of Georgia excellent opportunities in different fields of study. Mr. President, I yield well. You have questions, Senator. Chair recognizes the senator from the 42nd for a most intriguing question, I'm sure. Does the senator yield? Reluctantly? Yes. I wonder what you're so worried about. Speaking of top talent, Senator, is it not true that your tailor puts hidden messages inside the clothes that he makes for you? The senator knows what he speaks. You further yield. Reluctantly, yes. Are you sending up there today with a message underneath the collar of the jacket that you're wearing that's from your tailor to this body for us today? Senator, I appreciate your obsession with me, but I don't know what my clothes have to do with this bill. Do you further yield? Mr. President, I yield well. Do you have any more bills this session? No. The rather nicely dressed senator is yielded well. Chair recognizes the senator from the 4th. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Senator. I thought you wanted to come to the front, my apologies. The senator is for not suffering, has the deal done for some reason? Mr. Secretary, please unlock the machine. Mr. Secretary, please unlock the machine. The bill has received the regular constitutional majority. Mr. Secretary, please keep it rolling. House bill 217 read the caption. House bill 217, representative hall. Newly-100 and third. And others. Will swing to midnight to men. Article 6. Chapter 4. Title 20 of the Fish Coge. Annette Lloyd to do a achievement program. Says to make the dual achievement program a permanent statewide program to arrive for later matters. If you have been looking to laws and for other purposes. Mr. President of the Senate Committee on Higher Education recommends this bill to pass. This bill is submitted. Senator Burns, chairman. Mr. Senate, president, senator Hatch at the 50th offer. And others offer the following amendment number one to amend House bill 217 by deleting. Chapter 4 of online one by deleting vocational technical and the online two and inserting after. So as the following two update provisions relating to ineligibility for election to a local school board of education. It's required for the education savings authority to make limited disclosure of the Department of Revenue for purposes of verifying income as compared to income thresholds. Mr. President, that completes the order. And for the purpose. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. The chair recognizes the hard working and busy senator from the 50th to speak to House bill 217. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I rise to bring you House bill 217. What House bill 217 is, is it will extend the pilot program on the dual achievement program that is administered by the technical college system while also making changes to ensure that accountability for student success is still acknowledged. This program serves students who have nearly exited the educational system, effectively giving them a second chance to complete a high school diploma and an environment better suited for their academic achievement. When they finish the program, not only do they receive their high school diploma, but they also earn at least two technical certificates of credit ensuring that they are career ready and employable on day one post graduation. In essence, if you are struggling to graduate high school and you are looking for an alternative, this is that path. This expands the pilot program. In the four years since the pilot program was created, the program has awarded 334 diplomas and 898 college credentials. So it is very successful when it has changed lives. There is an amendment that is going around this from the governor's office as well. The first amendment seeks to close the loophole and the nepotism clause under the school board elections by referencing the most recent FTE count as opposed to the count from 2009. And the second part of the amendment would authorize the education savings authority under the student finance commission to work with the Department of Revenue to verify the income of applicants to the promise scholarship programs so they don't have to provide that information to themselves. So the next step is to make sure that the program is more accessible and that the program is more accessible. I am happy to answer any questions on the underline bill or the amendment. No questions, Senator. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the bill. Senator, the Senate will stand at ease for just a few moments while the amendment is going to be distributed on your desk. It's been printed, but it's being distributed now. So let's stand at ease for just a moment.
