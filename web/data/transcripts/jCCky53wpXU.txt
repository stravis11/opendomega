you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you Please take their seats. Mr. Clerk, let's give them one last signal with that bill. We're going to have the morning row call right now. All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in this chamber. Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines, please? Carrie, would you vote in? You got him? I'm going to go in. Have all members voted now. All members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machines. The door keepers, will you please close the doors and keep them closed? As is our custom, we will begin our date with scripture reading and prayer by our chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning comes from just down the road, and he's going to be introduced by the gentleman from the 19th House District, Representative Joseph Gullet. Representative Gullet. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning. It's my honor and privilege to introduce a dear friend of mine. He's a confidant and he's a mentor. His name is Tommy Leonard, and he's a man who makes everyone around him better. Whether he's leading a Bible study, praying over public safety, comforting those in need or simply sharing his wisdom with others, sharing his wisdom over a glass of sweet tea, his unwavering faith and love for the Lord shine brightly and everything he does. Tommy is also a devoted family man, and I'm thrilled that his wonderful wife, Ms. Donna, is here with him today. Their love and partnership of nearly 36 years are an inspiration to everyone who knows them. Together, they raise two sons and have been blessed before her and children, who no doubt are the light of their lives. If you ever have the privilege of knowing Tommy, you know he has a gift for lifting others up, whether through his wisdom, his kindness, or even his good nature laugh accompanied by his signature. Hey there, little brother. I'm grateful for his friendship, his guidance, and his example of what it truly means to live a life of faith and service. I know we're all in for a blessing today, and I'm excited to hear his message he's prepared for us. Please join me in welcoming Tommy Leonard to the George House. Mr. Speaker, I like the five minute rule brothers and sisters. It's not the length of the message. It's about the power of the message. Thank you for allowing me and Donna to be here with you today. As a chaplain of various agencies and departments throughout Paulton County, I have the honor and privilege to serve many first responders and citizens of our county in good times as well as bad times. Paulton County has been blessed to have some of the best first responders in our state. These are men and women that are willing to put it all on the line at any given moment. And the best part of my duty is being able to pray with these brothers and sisters. I've served on several boards in my 20 years working for Paulton County, and I can truly say that the board that I hold the most near and dear to my heart is the Paulton County Public Safety Appreciation Board. The board raises money throughout the year so that we can assist any of our first responders in times of need for providing resources to assist them with financial needs, or if they can have a catastrophic injury, or things like that. The best of things that would qualify for us to step in and help our brothers and sisters get back on their feet. Our organization has provided thousands of dollars to our first responders since the inception of our board, and it's a fantastic organization. All organizations that are successful must first have good solid leadership at the helm. God's Word tells us to pray for all leaders. And when it comes to praying for our leaders, 1 Timothy, chapter 2, verses 1 through 4, give us direct instructions. Our leaders need God's help. All of them. It's important to remember that God is not surprised by flawed individuals in high places. Jesus could have picked the dream team when he was choosing the disciples, but he chose 12 ordinary men. There is no substitution brothers and sisters for hard work and common sense. The first Timothy, chapter 2, verses 1 through 4 says this, I urge then first of all that petitions, prayers, intercession, and thanksgiving be made for kings and all those in authority that we may live peaceful lives and all godliness and holiness. This is good and it pleases God our Savior. Now Romans 3 1 says this, everyone must submit to governing authorities for all authority comes from God and those in positions of authority have been placed there by God. Now this one's not in the Bible, but when I saw it one day I knew it was the kind of leader that I would strive to be in my county. It goes like this, always remember that leadership is a privilege. When you're in a leadership role your influence may affect the trajectory of people's entire careers and often their lives. When you're in a leadership role you are responsible for those that serve beside you as well as those who serve under you. And lastly always remember to treat people with dignity and respect. You never know, you may have to work for them one day. Thank you again and I would like to ask if everybody would stand with me and I would like to pray with you and after I pray would you remain standing for the Pledge of Allegiance. Let us pray. Lord I pray for our nation and I pray for those in authority. Please guide our national state and local leaders. Lord I pray that our leaders would seek your wisdom in all matters and I pray for the citizens of our nation. Let us come together as Americans to show the world that we are compassionate, concerned and strong even under the most difficult times. God please heal our land from chaos and division and please help every leader to seek your face. And thank you for allowing us to live in a country that has an established form of government. Father I lift up each elected official and their staff members here today asking that you would bless them and their families in a mighty way and keep them safe. And Lord we lift up our military and first responder brothers and sisters as they do their job each day. Please return them home each day to their families after each watch or tour of duty. Let our cups overflow with your grace, mercy, peace and love. Forgive us of our sins, Lord, for they are many. And we pray all of this in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, Amen and Amen. I pray that the leaders who the flag of the United States will marry into the republic will stand one nation under our leadership, liberty and justice for all. The doorkeepers you may unlock the doors, members you may join the pastor and his wife in the south, south any room. You go to photo and express your appreciation for him being here today. Thank you. Thank you.

It is a great pleasure to have Governor Camp here today for this joint session. But before we get to the Governor's say to the state, there are some very special people here in the audience that we need to recognize. And I know no one more dear to the Governor's heart than the first lady in his three daughters, Ms. Morrie Camp. Please recognize Ms. Morrie Camp. We also like to welcome Governor's mother here today, Ms. Ann Cavittis. Also joining us today is his sister and her husband, Ms. Julie Reef and Mr. Rocky Reef. Please welcome them today. I also like to recognize the First Lady of the Senate. Ladies very dear to my heart, Ms. Jan Jones. I also have a former House member here today who I like to call father, Mr. Bill Jones is here today as well. He served as he says that he served back in the late 70s and early 80s and he said that's when we had fun up here. And I'm also proud to have my older brother here today, Mr. Brian Jones is also here as well. Obviously speaker burns, I take great pleasure in getting to introduce your lovely wife, Ms. Dale Burns here today. The speaker pro-tam of this chamber, Ms. Jan Jones, representative Jan Jones here. And our fine pro-tam, the man from Megan Georgian, Senator John F. Kennedy here today. Please welcome all at once all our constitutional officers are in the gallery there. Y'all please stand and be recognized. I want to thank Governor Camp for his steadfast leadership these last six years. Governor Camp has created economic growth beyond our imagination and he's done it from Brunswick to Blue Ridge from Augusta to Columbus. He is somebody who works tirelessly for the good people of the state of Georgia and he is somebody that I've been proud to work with not just in my time in the state Senate but as my, it's starting my third year as Lieutenant Governor. Governor Camp has always put Georgians first whether it's in economic growth whether it's an access to health care or whether it's been in our educational system, both K-312 and our higher education. He's guided us through some very tough times and also some very politically trying times. He got us through a pandemic in his early stages of his governorship. He also led us and really made us a model through the tragic incident that happened during Hurricane Helene where we had so many of our Georgians who were affected by it. You didn't hear a lot about it on the national level because Governor Camp and his team did such a great job of getting in front of that storm before and working through the aftermath before the news media could pick up on the fact that Georgia was doing things right. We weren't trying to blame anybody else. We were doing things right and he's still going to do more for those citizens of those communities that have been so affected by that. He's in his last two years and he deserves a lot of respect and he delivers a lot of credit for what we've been able to do here as elected officials in this state. And I look forward to serving the next two years with Governor Clem as well as Speaker Burns with you as well our elected officials both on the House and Senate side. So please give a warm welcome to the state to the governor of the great state of Georgia, Mr. Brian Peakeham. Thank you all so much. Thank you all. You're very kind. Thank you very much. Thank you, Lieutenant Governor Jones, Speaker Burns, President Pro Tem Kennedy, Speaker Pro Tem Jones, members of the General Assembly, my fellow constitutional officers, members of the Public Service Commission, Mayor Dickens, members of the Judiciary, members of the Consular Corps, and my fellow Georgians. As we begin a new year with some new colleagues under this gold dome, and as we reflect on the past successes and challenges of prior years, I'm reminded again and again that no matter what, Georgians outlast the tough times and achieve new heights of success. In just the six years since I've taken office, we have faced the trials of COVID-19. A major recession has resulted that unprecedented pandemic, the effects of 11 hurricanes, some of them causing historic generational damage, over 200 tornadoes that cause direct injuries in the summer of unrest and various threats to public safety, some of which are ongoing, and other challenges that required and received the very best of our people. And through it all, time and time again, Georgians have risen to the occasion. As the saying goes, tough times don't last, but tough people do. And if there's anything that I've learned in the six years that I've been honored to serve as your governor, it's that hard work in Georgians are not only tough, they're also generous, proud, and love our great state, because that is who we are, and that is why the state of our state is not only strong, it is resilient. Marty and I have been especially reminded of that following the devastating impacts of Hurricane Helene. With historic rainfall and mudslides in North Georgia, record flooding in Atlanta with over 11 inches in just two days, and a massive amount of damage across much of the South Eastern United States. Hundreds of thousands of Georgians across the state were victims of that storm's fury. Georgia Power reported it was the worst storm they've ever seen, with over 11,800 power poles broken, over 5,800 transformers damaged, and over 20,000 people who worked around the clock to restore power. In total, 230 people across the country lost their lives, 34 of them right here in Georgia, including four of our children. Marty and I toured 16 of the hardest hit counties in the Helene's awake, and in every community we saw utter devastation. But in the face of grief and unbearable loss, we also saw everyday heroes. We saw neighbors helping neighbors, lending the hand or a chainsaw, even when their own home or farm was in need of attention. We saw brand new church outreach programs, feeding whole towns, and we saw first responders who put their lives above their own. Will you please join me in applauding their bravery? Courageous men and women like them had to cut people out of their homes and sadly had to recover the bodies that those killed by this storm. The heartbreaking loss of these lives is made even worse by the loss of livelihoods, especially for our farmers and timber growers, who have endured over $5.5 billion worth of damage. As you know, our farmers needed relief quickly and efficiently, and that's why we repurposed $100 million to the Georgia Development Authority last November to provide direct financial support for our farmers and timber producers. It's also a long, it's also a long, long with our congressional delegation, Lieutenant Governor Jones, Speaker Burns, Commissioner Harper, many of you, and many others, urged the U.S. Congress and the Biden administration to fast try block grants to our state. I want to extend my deepest gratitude to every member of Georgia's congressional delegation, both Republicans and Democrats, who voted to support that legislation. I also want to thank both President Biden and President-elect Trump for their support of the disaster relief package as well. Our people were received the aid they desperately need and deserve, and for that, I am grateful. But rest assured, the elected leaders under this gold dome will stand with them for as long as necessary to make sure every Georgian can recover and come back stronger than before. Thank you. Thank you, and I thank the many members who work so hard out there on the ground as well in helping with the recovery. In just as communities across the state need relief after Hurricane Helene, all Georgians need permanent relief from the historic storm of inflation. The past three years have drained family bank accounts, sat the strength of our small businesses, and left too many Georgians struggling to make ends meet. From groceries and rent to building supplies and everyday goods and services, the price of nearly everything Georgians purchase or consume has gone up, often faster than their take home pay. This happened because the federal government decided to spend your money like it was somebody else's. Like a credit card with no limit that someone else would have to pay back. Instead of raining and spending, cutting taxes, or even coming close to balancing a budget. But in Georgia, we don't conduct the people's business with trillion dollar deficits or endless continuing resolutions. Just because we take in more money doesn't mean we need to create new big government programs to fund for eternity. Instead, we budget conservatively, fund our priorities, keep government efficient, cut taxes, and then return that money back to you. Between multiple tax rebates, multiple suspensions of the state gas tax over the past two years. The homeowner tax relief grant you passed last year. And the largest state income tax cut in history that the members seated here helped us accelerate. We've committed to saving Georgia taxpayers over $7.6 billion. And because of our conservative approach to budgeting, in this body's support and holding the line on state spending, along with the incredible economy we bolstered, we're able to double down on that relief. The prior acceleration you passed last session brought down the Georgia income tax rate to a rate of 5.39%. Down a full 36 basis points from where we started in 2022. Today, I'm proposing a further cut of 20 basis points to bring us down to just 5.19%. We're saving Georgia's another $7.5 billion over the next 10 years. Thank you. Thank you. Because at the end of the day, that's your money, not the government. And here in Georgia, we believe you should keep more of it. Our conservative budgeting and balance-based approach to taxes and spending are just some of the reasons that we've been named the top state for business for 11 years in a row, which is absolutely unprecedented. Like you, I am proud of that distinction because businesses, both large and small, and everything in between, are the lifeblood of our economy. When your community can attract a automotive supplier that creates 30 new jobs, or help an existing tissue and paper manufacturer, expand its operations by over 100 jobs, those are real lives and real families that are impacted. Those are hard work in Georgia's who now have a chance to start a career, provide for their loved one, and build a better future. Georgia's success in attracting good paying jobs and investments is widely known. Since I took office, together we have attracted over 193,000 new private sector jobs, in over $90 billion in investment. And the majority of those jobs and investments are going to rural areas. Those numbers just cover projects where the state was involved. They don't include all the organic growth underway throughout our entire state. Over the last 20 years, we have fought through economic headwinds and a pandemic, while still remaining one of the best states for business in economic opportunity. Georgia prevailed because when the state welcomes job growth, innovation, and prosperity, everyone prosperous, no matter their zip code. While we're number one for business, we're number one for business because we listen to and work with new and existing job creators. We didn't hand out government mandates or let partisan politics dictate state policy. We let our people and our job creators lead the way. We trusted hard work and Georgians to use their God-given abilities to create and innovate, and our state is better all for it. But Georgia's economic success is a lot like football. To quote Coach Kirby Smart, humility is only a week away, and there are storm clouds on the horizon. As we look ahead, I believe one of the biggest threats to Georgia's future is our state's legal environment. Last year, my office worked with the General Assembly in the Insurance Commission's office in John King to pass House Bill 1114. This legislation allowed Commissioner King to gather data and information on Georgia's insurance industry. Identify reforms that could be made to stabilize insurance cost. Expand choices for consumers when they need coverage and prevent more insurance carriers from leaving Georgia altogether. Additionally, over the last few months, my office hosted three round tables throughout the state. Listening to small businesses across a wide range of industries, including healthcare providers from Albany to Tacoma, and some of our state's largest employers. Even though each person at those round tables came from a different part of our state, represented a different industry or business, told a unique story or had a different perspective. The call for action was unanimous. It's abundantly clear that the status quo isn't working, and a failure to act on meaningful tort reform will continue to put Georgians and their livelihoods in serious jeopardy. For some that I met, the cost of insurance is threatened their ability to operate. Small business owners reported insurance premiums up anywhere from 30% to over 100% over the last few years, causing them hundreds, hundreds of thousands or millions just to get basic coverage. For too many of them, that meant holding back on hiring more employees, waiting to grow their business, or making difficult decisions about whether or not they could even keep the lights on. Here's the biggest problem was the complete lack of insurance options, or the threat of paying thousands or millions to fend off excessive lawsuits. At the end of the day, the increased cost of doing business has simply passed on to the consumer, hard work in Georgians who are already struggling to make ends meet. As a small business owner for over 35 years, I know that if you can't get insurance, you can't run a business and you can't pay your employees. And nobody can afford to spend years and millions in a courtroom battling to keep the doors open in their small business. It's unsustainable and it's widespread. At our first round table, we spoke to the leaders of a child care company with multiple locations in Metro Atlanta. They have experienced a 100% increase in insurance costs since just 2018. We heard from a South Georgia grocer who lost coverage completely after frivolous lawsuits were filed. One business owner's statement stuck out to me. He said, at this point, I don't feel like I'm able to run my business. I'm just trying not to lose it. That sentiment carried into our second round table with health care providers and making. Where we heard firsthand the challenges our legal environment poses to critical services, our health care workforce, and the ability for hospitals and clinics to operate. One hospital system that serves much of rural Georgia had liability premiums go up 115% in just one year. Another hospital in northwest Georgia actually had their premiums decreased 13% from 2022 to 2024. But only because the facility closed their labor and delivery unit in 2021. This was due to workforce challenges and soaring liability insurance costs. We were told story after story of hospitals struggling to recruit and retain doctors, especially OBGYNs and other specialty disciplines, because other states offer stronger protections for health care providers, lower insurance rates, and a more level playing field in their court runms. And we've heard from multiple doctors who wondered how much longer they're going to be able to practice, prefer being targeted by baseless or excessive lawsuits. These stories highlight a legal environment that leads to fewer options for Georgia seeking care, higher cost, and ultimately worse health outcomes for our people. At the third round table, some of Georgia's favorite brands and biggest job creators shared the challenges confronting their businesses and employees. The round table was hosted by Waffle House, and I think everyone here will agree that no matter your politics, there's nothing more Georgian than ordering hash browns smothered and covered from one of their 440 locations across our state. I know that hash browns line will get y'all. Whether it's an emergency family trip on Thanksgiving because the turkey ended up burnt, the midnight meal during an all night study session in college or celebrating the big win by your son or daughter's wreck team. Waffle House and great Georgia brands like them create unforgettable memories for all of us. They also create opportunity and a great career for their employees over 10,000 of them in Georgia alone. Waffle House, as you know, is open on July 4th, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's, Easter, and everything in between. In case one of us needs a cup of coffee and all star special, or just a friendly smile. In fact, they're only closed when disaster strikes or unfortunately when they can't afford to remain open because of the legal environment that forces them to limit hours, hold back on hiring or change their business model. Georgia accounts for roughly 22% of Waffle House locations in the country, but almost 37% of their litigation costs. Their liability insurance premiums have gone up 235% since 2018. And their average cost for a negligent security lawsuit in Georgia is five times higher than in Florida. Nine times higher than Texas. 21 times higher than South Carolina. And 27 times the average cost of the similar lawsuit in Alabama. When we talk about how to continue Georgia's success at this top state for business for the next 11 years, and how to keep our states best and brightest days ahead, it starts right here. Stories like Waffle House. Stories like those small town grocers and childcare facilities. The mom and pop restaurants that make our communities special. The healthcare providers who are there for us when we need them the most. Without them, our state is not the same. In Georgia, we'll never realize it's full potential. The tort reform legislation my office will introduce in the coming days will be comprehensive, but fair. Because in Georgia, we believe those who do wrong should be held accountable. And if you have been wrong, you deserve justice. I also believe the legislation we will be introducing can and should have bipartisan support. Making sure your neighborhood has a grocery store with fresh food available to a young single mom. Or an elderly couple on a fixed income. Isn't a Republican or a Democrat issue recruiting an OBGYN or a GI doctor to your hometown. Doesn't depend on what lever you pull in the voting booth. Stabilizing the cost of car insurance and insuring families have access to affordable housing. It's not partisan. It's common sense. Given working people in small business owners a chance that their American dream is about who we are as a state, not what political party we support. To my democratic friends, there is no reason we can't tackle tort reform together. Passing anti-hate crimes legislation, repealing the citizens arrest statute and supporting victims of human trafficking. These are all tough issues, but Democrats and Republicans accomplished them together because it was the right thing to do for all Georgians, not just the ones that voted for us. Thank you. Thank you. As a former legislator myself, I can promise you that a vote to support the hardworking men and women of our state, a vote to put them first ahead of the status quo is never a bad vote.

But I know this issue is complicated and will not be easy to fix. There are many different stakeholders with competing ideas about how to move forward. However, doing nothing is no longer an option. We will do what is right by the people of our state. We will be fair to all involved in this important debate. And we will work together to pass legislation that strikes the right balance and puts hard work in Jordan's first. But also I want to be very clear. There's always room for compromise, but there will be no room for excuses, half measures or failure. Whether it is this legislative session, or perhaps a second one later this year, we will achieve meaningful, impactful, tort reform. The lieutenant governor and the speaker noticed how quick y'all picked up on that last line. Because if we take seriously our mission to keep George the best place to live, work, and raise a family for the next generation, we have to get off the sidelines and get the work. Keeping our state moving in the right direction also means proudly supporting our law enforcement, and honoring those who bravely run into the face of danger to protect and defend us all. Last year when the deranged gunman, last year when the deranged gunman attacked one of our schools, a place that should be safe for everyone, two on-site officers confronted and arrested him within two minutes. While numerous local and state law enforcement rushed to the scene, including Sheriff Judd Smith, those two school resource officers saved many lives at Appalachia High School on that horrific day, and had more than earned our gratitude. Sergeant Chase Boyd, Deputy Brandon King, and Sheriff Smith are here with us today. I'd like to ask them to stand and let us thank them and their colleagues for their heroic efforts. As you can imagine, these two did not want to be with us here today. They wanted to be protecting their school, but I told them it was important for them to be here for us to let them and their colleagues around the state know how much we appreciate what you do every single day to keep our schools and our communities safe. Thank you all. Also I want to thank those members of the legislature who were here in 2019 and 2023 who supported two rounds of funding for direct campus security grants to every school in Georgia. And last year with the support of Lieutenant Governor Jones and Speaker Burns and you all the members of the General Assembly, we made yearly funding to strengthen school safety a permanent part of our base budget. In total we have allocated $294 million for campus safety so far. And my budget proposal includes a further $159 million for that purpose. This is where protecting Georgia's children in our classroom. We're also going after those who target them outside of school including gangs and human traffickers. Thanks to the vital work of the members of the Grace Commission, law enforcement partners including the GBI's human trafficking exploitation unit and prosecutors on the state and local levels, all championed by the nation's best first lady, Marty Kemp. The state now, the state is now investigated over 330 human trafficking cases, convicted 49 human traffickers and saved roughly 200 lives. I want to thank Attorney General Chris Carr and the human trafficking prosecution unit led by Hannah Palmquist for all that they have done to help make Georgia a safe place for victims in a hostile state for the perpetrators. The Attorney General's office is also investigated 140 gang related cases, securing 52 convictions and charged more than 140 individuals. And that's just since the unit was stood up less than two years ago. My budget includes just over $1.2 million to expand the gang and human trafficking prosecution units in the Attorney General's office to further this good work. Also Marty were spearhead the passage of her tent human trafficking bill that will reinforce the good work of the Grace Commission. Their resilience in fighting this good fight is why Georgia is leading on this issue and this latest measure will be yet another reminder that if you come after our children, we are coming after you. Mrs. Marty has been instrumental in going after those who threaten our children and making Georgia a safe place for those seeking to rebuild their lives. She has also been a tireless champion for mental health services. For over a year now she has promoted the 988 suicide and crisis hotline. She has carried this message forward. It's okay to not be okay. And as a result, more and more Georgians are finding the support they need to stay resilient in the face of difficulty. Last year you put more funding toward behavioral and mental health needs than ever before, over $1.6 billion. I want to thank the First Lady, Commissioner Cavantanner and the frontline caregivers who are helping Georgia's process and over can't overcome the challenges of mental distress. Several of those caregivers have joined us today. They are the true coaches of resiliency who help children and young adults deal with the unimaginable. Christine Aloe, Whitney Hardegree, Laura Ettrich and Karen Hope were some of the first on the scene in the days following the tragedy at Appalachia School. Their strength, knowledge and skill have helped those who have witnessed evil be able to move forward and continue on life's path. And for that, they have our deepest gratitude. I'd like to ask Christina, Whitney, Laura and Karen to please stand and let us recognize you and thank you for all that you are doing. We know that your work is not complete and there is a long road ahead, but we are grateful for what you and the Sheriff's Department are doing to continue to support the great community in Barrow County. Mental health services like this are improving the quality of health care and access in our state. As is the newly launched state-based exchange, which is the latest milestone on the plan we laid out in the patient's first act of 2019. These ongoing efforts are lowering the cost of premiums and increasing the number of those insured in Georgia. In fact, since I took office, the combined work of Georgia Access and Georgia Pathways is covering over 1.5 million people across our state. I will continue to repeat this until I'm blue in the face, even though many on the other side or in the media do not want to hear it. We are covering well over 200,000 more Georgians than traditional Medicaid expansion would cover. And it's important to remember those Georgians are on better plans that deliver better coverage and lead to better health outcomes for them and their families. In fact, since I've taken office, we've seen over 93 provider rate increases through traditional Medicaid and costs to the state have grown by more than $250 million per year. So when you hear someone say that fully expanding traditional Medicaid is visibly responsible, know that they are selling you a bill of goods because the numbers simply don't match the rhetoric. In total, Georgia spends over $4.2 billion for Medicaid in our state. And there are those who say the program only needs more money to succeed. Well, I respectfully disagree. With the new administration coming to Washington, I'm looking forward to furthering our innovative approach to healthcare access, which is making Georgia a leader in this field. And as I announced yesterday, alongside Lieutenant Governor Jones and Speaker Burns, we're making it even easier to sign up for the Georgia Pathways program that helps Georgia start a rewarding career, get a degree, attain real-world skills, and ultimately receive better healthcare coverage. My high school football coach used to say, winning is contagious. He knew that when you have the momentum, when the entire team buys into the same mission, the same vision, when they play for each other, good things happen. Much like winning in football, I believe Georgia's success can be contagious. In spite of unprecedented challenges and many hard days, Georgia has enjoyed historic success. The job's an investment, growth and opportunity to freedom and prosperity. As the Speaker always says, it's a great time to be at Georgia. We achieved more than many thought we would, and we proved big things can get done. We showed that the Georgia way is indeed the better way. So let's keep playing hard for the people who sent us here. Let's keep putting hard work in Georgia's and our state's success first. Let's avoid distractions and line up together to secure victory. I believe Georgia's success is prosperity and is promise for opportunity for all, are indeed contagious. And it's our job to keep it that way. So let's get to work. Thank you all. May God bless you and may God continue to bless the great state of Georgia. Thank you very much. Thank you, Governor. Appreciate you and appreciate that message and we appreciate everyone being here today and joining us and we look forward for a great next two years and look forward to another one session, right, this year, right?

Chair recognizes Representative Kendrick for an afternoon order. Representative? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I didn't give this announcement yesterday because it was a busy day. If you are a lawyer, if you could stand, we had the opportunity to take a picture on the North's capital steps. Traditionally we take a picture for the state bar magazine and everybody has jokes about attorneys until they need one. But we had a lot more attorneys when I started 15 years ago and I'm proud to serve with each and every one of these lawyer legislators because I do believe they provide value to the Georgia House of Representatives and over in the Senate. So Mr. Speaker, if I could make today hug a lawyer legislator day, with their consent, of course, I would greatly appreciate it but I look forward to working with each and every one of you. So thank you for taking the picture yesterday. Thank you, Representative Kendrick. Any comments is recognized for an afternoon order representative? I will the members of the COV delegation please come forward. COV delegation please come forward and join them. And members, I want you to pay attention to this afternoon order. COV delegation. It is with great sadness that I have to report that yesterday afternoon a 12 year old girl shot herself in the girls room at Lindley Middle School, which is right around the corner from where I live in Maybilton. She was taken to Cobb Hospital and she's currently at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. Right now she's in critical condition. Little officers and Cobb Police responded between 60 and 90 seconds of the event. Greatfully no other students or teachers were harmed. But investigators do not wear this 12 year old little girl back to weapon and how she got it into school. So I'm asking for a moment of silence and prayer for this young girls recovery. Thank you, Speaker. Thank you, Representative. Not just now, but our ongoing prayers need to be that family and that young lady. I know the members will certainly respond in that way. That completes our afternoon orders. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to a group of privileged resolutions? Recognizing and commending Gordon L. Gilley, recognizing commending revenue.
