----------
Morning everybody.
>> Morning Dean Green. Good to see you.
>> Thank you.
>> Good morning everybody.
>> If you will please take your seats and
we'll call the meeting to order and
we'll begin. Uh we're going to ask
Chairman Limson to open us up with a
word of prayer this morning. Thank you.
Should be on. Try it. Try it now.
Try the one next to you.
>> Yeah. Hold on. We get the wireless to
over there.
Little technical difficulty here.
Yeah,
that's your button again there.
>> Try it again.
No,
>> try that one. Okay.
>> All right. If you would bow with me,
please. Our heavenly father, we thank
you for this day. We thank you for your
love and your goodness to us and for
watching over us and caring for us. We
thank you for the opportunity that you
have given to each of us to be here
today. We just pray that you would bless
our time together. Uh we thank you for
the uh position that you've placed each
of us in. We just ask for your guidance
and your wisdom as we uh look at doing
the things that uh come before us today
to hopefully do good things for the
people of the state of Georgia. We just

and direction. We pray it in Jesus name
and for his sake. Amen.
>> Amen.
>> Amen. Thank you, sir. Sorry about the
technical difficulties there.
Okay, let's go ahead and begin. Replace.
Thank you, chairman.
I come before you with Georgia House
Resolution 1177.
It's a bipartisan resolution about
saving lives because when 84% of
pedestrians death happen at night,
visibility becomes a matter of life and
death. That single fact tells us that
this resolution matters. Across Georgia,
pedestrians fatalities are rising at an
alarming and an unacceptable rate. In
2024 alone, 294
pedestrians were killed and the vast
majority of them were at night.
These are not just isolated incidents.
They are a clear pattern demanding
action and house resolution 1177
response to the crisis with common sense
datadriven approach focused on a
critical factor visibility.
So when drivers cannot see, lives are
challenged. Thank you.
>> Okay. Thank you, ma'am. We don't don't
see any questions. Thank you. My
senator, Senator Burns.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning,
committee. I have before you today
Senate Bill 74. Senate Bill 74 protects
Georgia's children from being provided
access to harmful materials in
libraries. It repeals an exemption for
libraries and librarians from the
provisions of OCGA1612103,
which is our obscinity laws, but it has
certain protections. I want to thank the
uh Judiciary Non-Ivil Committee for
working with me on this bill. I want to
thank the West Georgia Regional Library
System for uh offering some friendly
amendments that we adopted and I
appreciate the consideration for SB74.
>> Okay, got a couple of questions for you.
equip part.
>> Um I don't know what's going on over
here. Just use that wireless. Try try
that.
>> Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
>> Senator Burns, um why are you trying to
Why are you trying to criminalize
librarians? You know, I I received the
emails, you know, saying or implying
that libraries were these
obscene material. Can you help me
understand or demonstrate proof in which
libraries are have all these seen
materials that would warrant the
criminal library in Georgia. Uh thank
you for the question. First of all, this
bill in no way criminalizes librarians
or libraries. This let me explain what
it does not do. It does not change
longestablished Georgia statutes as it
relates to obscinity laws in Georgia go
back to 1969.
It does not ban any book. No book is
banned. Number three, it does not
criminalize librarians. It does require
them to reatalog and place those books
in the appropriate areas. I'm happy to
provide you with examples, and your
colleagues are happy to provide you with
examples of materials in Georgia
libraries in children's sections that
are inappropriate.
>> One more follow-up question.
Would it not be more appropriate if
you're concerned with obscenity to ban
the internet from children with respect
to their access as criminalizing
librarians, which this bill does do?
Uh, I I appreciate your comments and I
acknowledge the fact that the internet
provides access that is virtually
unfettered, although we do have filters
in libraries and schools to protect our
children. I want to reiterate this does
not criminalize anything. It simply
requires all Georgians to follow
longestablished Georgia law. So you sir
must follow this law. I must follow this
law. It does in no way criminalize
anyone.
Chairman Hawkins.
>> Okay. Took care of that. He waved. Uh
Representative Miller,
try your mic. See if it works by chance.
No. She's a
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Um, just on
your point of of not criminalizing, just
just so I'm clear, there's no provision
in this bill that allows for the arrest
of a librarian as it relates to
>> there are certain provisions in the
legislation that gives protections to
the librarians. It's been there for a
long time. What this bill does is remove
the exception and places the
responsibility on the governing
authority of that library or that
school. The only way that a librarian
will be held accountable is if they fail
to comply with their local board's uh
decisions on the materials. Again, the
materials themselves are not removed.
They are reataloged and placed in
appropriate sections for adults.
>> Okay? And just so I understand the the
removal of immunity, the immunity was
from criminal prosecution. Correct.
>> That is correct.
>> So if we are removing immunity from crim
uh removing immunity from criminal
prosecution, how is that not
criminalizing librarians?
>> There's no difference between a
librarian in a middle school and a
seventh grade teacher in a middle
school. the middle school teacher is not
afforded any protections from uh
providing harm from the children minors.
What this does is place the school
librarian in the exact same posture. You
madam are
>> represent
>> respons I'm sorry representative forgive
me uh you representative are
under this statute as I am and so we're
not criminalizing anyone. We're trying
to protect children. One followup. There
was a rationale for providing librarians
this this carveout. Is is that not true?
>> Uh you're welcome to share with me that
rationale. I failed to understand why it
was ever put in statute. Well, I I guess
what I'm what I'm trying to make sure
I'm clear on is if if you know that
there was immunity provided to
librarians who do hold a special place
in our society and in our community, um
if we are stripping that immunity away,
have you not thought through why they
had it in the first place? We had that
discussion extensively in committee
and there was a great deal of input from
both libraries and librarians as well as
p the public. I think I spent five
sessions in uh house judiciary non-civil
debating and discussing this issue.
Where we landed where where we finally
agreed to on the language that you see
in front of you now is based on a
recommendation
from the director of the West Georgia
Regional Library System. and we're
trying to protect children but also
provide librarians the flexibility to do
their job professionally and we're
grateful for that.
>> Thank you. I I think we can protect the
the the intent of your bill is certainly
admirable but um removing immunity does
not seem to be necessary uh for us to do
that. We we don't need to incentivize
prosecution of librarians when we are
obviously overrun uh in our society and
our communities by violent crime and
other criminals who deserve to be
prosecuted. So um I'm I'm sorry I can't
support this bill.
>> Thank you for your
>> waves. Okay. Don't see any other
questions.
Chairman Thomas.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm here to
present House Bill 1063. It's on page
two, the bottom of the blue sheet.
House Bill 1063 protects residential and
retail electricity customers from costs
assoc associated with data center
construction and operation. Uh it does
so at the very high level. It requires
electric utility contracts with data
centers to include terms protecting
residential and retail customers from
costs related to data center
construction and operation. It mandates
minimum billing requirements and
contracts to recover incremental costs
of serving or preparing to serve data
centers. It allows contract terms to
exceed the length of the standard
utility service tariffs. It requires
performance and credit provisions and
contracts to protect retail customers of
data center defaults on the contract. It
mandates termination provisions to
protect retail customers if electric
service contracts with data centers are
ended. Uh it applies the new
requirements only to contracts entered
onto or after the effective date of the
act and it grants the Georgia Public
Service Commission authority to
determine compliance with these
requirements. That's the uh high level
overview.
>> Okay. Any questions?
>> Don't see any questions. Thank you, sir.
>> Thank you.
recognize Speaker Pro Tim.
>> Thank Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I've got
a um rule substitute to House Bill 907
that I would request that the committee
consider it. Makes a
a very minor but meaningful change on
in section two. Um the language needed
modifying um to make sure that an
existing completion school could offer
services in a region that does not
currently have a completion school
available to students at risk for
dropping out. There's one in particular
that wants to offer these services. It's
Foothills which is based in the Athens
region and they want to offer services
to Rockdale and the way the language was
written earlier um they had to already
be offering those services. They do not
currently offer those services and want
to and I'd ask for the uh committee's
favor consideration.
