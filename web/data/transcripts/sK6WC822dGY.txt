TRANSCRIPT
----------
like our ways and means committee will be right at home here just like room 133 with all these folks and in the building but chairman I'm Sean Blackman, we would like to welcome you and it's good to be in Athens, Georgia. I think we have a couple of folks that are going to get us kicked off here today. Dr. Daniel, thank you for hosting us at Athens Technical College. There you are over there. Would you like to say a few words to us this morning? Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Athens Technical College. We are so glad to have each of you here today. We appreciate the support that are led to slay tours on the Senate side and the house side give to us each and every day. I appreciate my delegation. Many of you are here today. And thank you for what you help us do with workforce development. That is our mission. That's what we're here to do. Please help us spread the word. Our enrollment, I'm going to brag for just one second. Our enrollment is at almost 9% this term. And out of all the 22 technical colleges. We have a 31.4% increase in graduates, the highest of any technical college. So thank you so much for your support. It would not be possible for us to do what we do without the support of the legislators who are here today. So thank you again. Thank you so much, Dr. Daniel. Thank you for all you all do. And we also have the Dean of the Grady College of Mass Communication and Journalism over at the University of Georgia, Dr. Charles Davis is with us this morning. Thank you for being here. Go dogs. Go dogs. Absolutely my pleasure. Welcome everybody. It's a cat house. I have just a brief a story to tell you about why I am here. And the importance of the film industry in Georgia to the work that we do at Grady College. I took this job 11 years ago, which still sounds strange to say, but 11 years ago took this job. And when I got to UGA, we were doing extraordinarily little in the realm of film and television production. It did not take a rocket scientist to figure out that we needed to be doing a lot more. So we set out to start beefing up our film and TV production. And almost immediately we were approached by representatives from what was then Pinewood. Now Trilleth, our friends, Dan Kathy and others down south of Atlanta and they said, would you be interested in building an MFA program, a master of fine arts product in film and TV production? We said, yeah, of course we do. We don't know how, but we'll figure it out as we go. We were getting a wave of retirements about that time. So I started converting what were other faculty members and other disciplines to film and TV production. So we heard sedimentographers and lighters, the string writers, the showrunners and producers. While we're short, today we have 14 faculty in a department called Entertainment and Media Studies, which is wholly dedicated to film and television production. Our goal is to produce Georgians for Georgia jobs and it's working while we're story short. Three years into that endeavor we were approached by our friend Joel Harbor, where's Joel? Joel Harbor approached us and said, I'm going to build a sound stage complex just north of Athens off the bypass. I'm going to call it Athena Studios and then he asked me the strangest question ever. Would you be interested if I built you a sound stage? That was a funny conversation. I don't remember it well because I said, yes, please. That would be fine. Joel's not kidding. Today we set at Athena Studios right off the bypass here in a 14,000 square foot sound stage. Many of you are going to see later today. I know our students adore it. We are producing film and television there on a daily basis with our MFA and our undergraduate students. I say that by a way of underscoring the fact that none of this, none of this would exist where it not for the growth of the film industry in the state of Georgia. We wouldn't be there. We would still be a program that were really producing folks for jobs that didn't exist. So we are so excited to be here and thrilled to see you all and just excited that you're an Athens. So welcome. Thank you so much Dr. Davis. And joining me with greetings as well as Mayor of Athens Clark and Mayor Gertz. Thank you, Chairman. Welcome to Athens, everyone. We're welcome back in many cases, I know folks have spent some of their glory years here and we're really glad to have you back under any circumstances. I promise the Chairman I'm not going to call the fire inspector on this room. So hopefully you'll be safe and secure for some period of time. I really want to thank members of the General Assembly. I think many folks in the state think they work for 40 days a year and that's it and they're demonstrating today that they're spending their time and sweat every day throughout this year, taking care of the good folks who we love so dearly in our state. Thank you Mayor. It's good to be in Athens. So also want to thank our panelists and let them introduce themselves, Chairman Hubsteadler. If that's okay, we can start with you or start with me and I'll go to you. I'll hand it off to you, Shaw Blackman. I'm from Houston County, right in middle Georgia and this may be a little corny, but my favorite film growing up was The Natural. So anybody else wants to share theirs? Feel free to do so. All right. This is Mike Omen here. Yes. All right. Thank you. Chuck Hubsteadler. This is California Senate Chair of the Finance Committee out of Rome, Georgia. And well, the last maybe I saw was flying back from overseas Monday. It was a last Paris sport film. I always liked his humor and action adventure from the combination knowledge movie. So I like those a lot. He film one in Rome, Georgia. Here's your terrible film. Other than that, he's very well. Good morning. I'm here to set up the Senate District 56 Cobb, Charity and Blooming County Vice Chair of Finance and the favorite movie. I will go with a member of the title design. That's wonderful. Thank you. Bill, Councillor, represent Athens. So good to have everybody in the classic city today and you're having technical campus, which is much hidden secret. Thank you. There's lots of people who work really, who work for us. I got to go with, it's a wonderful life. I still see it every Christmas and private time. I'm sorry. My name is Chuck Martin. I represent the 49th District in North Fulton County. It's portions of Rallswell, Milton and Alpharetta. I'm going to go back to old school. I like John Wayne when they did the Green Beret movie. I just thought it was a good film for our military. Thank you. I'm Matt Hatchett from Dublin, represent Lawrence and Johnson County. Chair of the House of Propreations, I'm sitting down here with my colleague and cohort. We're going to keep the tables balanced down here. My favorite movie is probably the good old forest gun. I'm Blake Tiller. I'm from Voddele. I represent 11 counties in Southeast Georgia. I'm sitting down here to help box the house in a little bit on an issue. My favorite movie would be Tombstone. I can quote it from beginning to end. I hear that Kurt Russell has been playing a hoot-beast. Kurt, if you're watching today, when you land next time, let me know. I'll meet you at the airport. Awesome. I believe we have the Department of Revenue to get us kicked off through today. Is that just given? I'm not going to give them by service to the rector of external affairs and communication at the Department of Revenue. My favorite movie is about the great philosophy for forest-hound. I guess the legislature is also like a box of chocolate to meet them. I'm really just going to point out that we had our presentation out of it. I'm going to be dead by Deputy State, right? I'm going to be your commissioner, Chester, in our direct-driven compact policy. They'll be leading our presentation. We just want to give you an overall view of the film tax credit from the Department's perspective, specifically the film tax audit process. We have a couple of two archives throughout the slide deck that will take you to different portions of our website, the committee, and the audience might find relevant. With that, I'll hand it over to Chester and Kelsey. Thank you. Is this working? There we go. Thank you. Appreciate the opportunity to talk a little bit about the film tax credit. Obviously, with some legislation, other changes in the past few years, there's been a good number of changes. We're certainly glad to talk about what the department does in terms of administering the film tax credit. So just a couple high-level things, basically, to qualify for the film tax credit, the nuts and bolts are yet to spend $500,000 on qualified expenses that are Georgia expenses. And to do that, then you're eligible for the 20%-based tax credit, which is what everyone gets, that qualifies. And then if the production has certain promotional activities, such as the Georgia P.C.D. and or other activities that are approved by the Department of Economic Development, there's a 10% uplift. For the most part, most projects typically end up qualifying for the 30% total. And then the production company is simply a general entity that's producing the film in terms of shooting the films. It can be a pilot series, television, commercials, videos. Again, as long as it's something that's going to, at least for the 10% uplift, be distributed and must be distributed somewhere. It doesn't include news, athletic events, local interest programming, instructional videos, or corporate videos. Just a little history. Credit began in 2005, and then there were some changes. In 2008, the 20% credit came into play with a 10% uplift. Then in 2013, a couple of changes. There was a sales tax exemption in place for certain equipment used at the filming site. That was removed, and then a requirement was added, which is a big, what I'll put is a big compliance requirement for the program is to put mandatory withholding on loan out, so basically loan outs are the talents. Most of the talent have their own company. It's called a loan out company. So when they do work for production company, we require that they withhold on the gross amount that they pay to the production, to that particular loan out at the statutory tax rate. So we get the gross amount, and then ultimately those folks will end up following their own returns to determine what their reliability is. Whether they follow or not, the state actually has the money upfront, so if they don't follow, we already have our money. So that's a really important compliance piece of what the department does in part of the program. In 2016, Bill passed a lot of credits to be certified electronically. That's a big piece for DR. We're essentially a big technology company. We're heavily reliant on technology. So the advantages, of course, are that all the transactions for both. The generation, as well as the transfer of the credits, is all handled electronically through a process of what we call the IT trans. It's extremely efficient. So as soon as those come in, the system does the work, it matches the certificates. Inside our system itself, what we do to track credits, we do really a couple things. We receive a file from economic development every month that tells us what projects are approved directly. We load that in our system. It has the tax number, the name of the project, the company. So we can match that up when folks come in for their returns or when they come in for their audit to determine one, they're qualified. They've been qualified from economic development. Also, it lets us know whether they receive the 10% uplift or not so that we know the appropriate credit to apply. And then it allows everyone to self-serve and transfer credits at their will without having to put it on the return or do any main work by DOR. So it's a really, really effective and efficient process. In 2020, House Bill 1037 changed the landscape quite a bit for film tax credits and the audit program in particular. That bill was a result of a performance audit that was completed by the Department of Audits on the film tax program. And it had several recommendations in there, employee, third party auditors have the department still ultimately review and sign off on the credits, use sampling methods for the audits. A few other things that DOR actually suspected that or that methodology and process was already coming. In fact, before 1037, the department was already ready to ramp up a pilot program to allow third party auditors to do the work because the demand for production companies to want their audit, their production audited was really growing. The department has always had a voluntary audit where someone can come to us and say, please audit me, tell me what that final number is. And then we'll issue a final certificate on what that is, which is in the industry often referred to as the golden ticket. So that just grew. So we were already working on that when 1037 came in, which also allowed us to step that program up relatively quick because we had the infrastructure in place to do that since we were already willing to do that. So as part of that, 1037 on a phased in approach requires all productions to go through a mandatory audit. So that was very similar to what happens in other states. So we knew that was coming as well. And that was something that the department was going to certainly set move forward in terms of third party auditors since most people were going to end up using them anyways. So, so that requires that beginning in 2023, now all projects have to undergo an audit. It began in 2021 and there was a phase in for the large projects first, as well as kind of a middle ground and then the smaller projects. Along with that, also the bill created a certification program for the department for the third party audit. There's auditors that want to conduct it and conduct the department or conduct the audit on behalf of the department have to go through some DOR training. We partnered with a national group, the Multistate Tax Commission, where we developed a sampling methods for this. And to date, we have five firms that are certified. We currently are undergoing a training program right now to certify more. There's another six or seven firms that want to take the training to get certified to conduct the audits. And on top of that, other states are also interested, for example, the state of Montana is taking that training right now. And in terms of what we do in our audit program and the Film Tax Credit Administration in general, other states have looked at what we've done and they've reached out. We've talked to South Carolina. We've talked to Illinois and California has also reached out to us recently to talk about a program. The other thing that it also provided with 1037 is since the department signs off on the final number. That allows the production company to go ahead. And if they disagree with the results, they're still their due process available if they disagree with the audit. They can follow protests as they can for any other sort of tax or agency action that goes on. Previously, the way it worked was slightly different before 1037 because the rights to certain extent were actually with the purchase or the credit. So there was a little bit of a disconnect there where the production companies were the ones audited, but the impacts were to the purchasers. But this put a clear path for production companies to protest the audit findings. This is just sort of the overview of the agency involvement. Again, Department of Economic Development certifies the projects. And once they do that, we're provided a list. Department of Economic Development handles the promotional piece so they determine the 10% uplift and then they let us know about an electronic file that we see very months. And then we conduct all of the credits. Some production companies, they're welcome to choose the department to conduct their audit. If not, then there's a list of third party that they can request. And then the department will ultimately make the approval or disapproval or assignment of the audit firm that performs the audit. That's currently within the department's statutory ability to determine who that is. And then also the department conducts administrative appeals. In terms of the film group, currently we have 11 audors and then that are DOR employees and then that's of course augmented by currently five CBA firms and we expect that to increase here in the near future. One kind of important thing, whether we talk about where we started a voluntary audit program to allow people to come in to voluntarily be audited or whether it was related to the mandatory audits. The department has a fee schedule for that and always has. So the auditors and the audit program itself for this are completely funded by fees paid by the industry for the audit program. So the audors themselves are covered by that. So that's not, the state doesn't actually appropriate funds for those auditors. It's a self-managed self-funded program. And again, they conduct audits to the production expenditures, approve and finalize the certificates that we issue. We issue one certificate per project and then that can be transferred or pieces of it to purchasers. And in our system, we contract that from cradle to grave, from the creation to the individual certificate to any individual that purchase or is transferred to credit. That is a unique certificate that can only be used once that is managed on that tax payers account. So there is no other way to, for example, file a tax return and claim a tax credit that you don't have. There is a certificate across all of our tax credits the way we manage it. They one certificate per person per credit. So that allows us both to track what's on the books, what a tax payer can take along the carry forward and of course that's also a really strong internal control from a fraud perspective that we control. We assign everything is unique and there's a one per there. So there can't be any duplicate claims of credits. So and once we go through the audit, we kind of document everything whether it's a mandatory volunteer in voluntary and then we find the usual monthly reports that we receive on how many projects are in, how many we completed, how much did we issue, what are the projects, those kinds of things. So once dollars come up over a certain threshold, the audits from the audits of the staff get reviewed at a higher level because we have thresholds within the department for approvals as any other organization would in terms of dollar thresholds to approve credits. And then of course, transfers credits, free transfers, transferees and then we oversee the certified audit program. I'll let Kelsey talk a little bit of here just some some visual stuff about the life cycle of the film tax credit. Let's see if you guys can hear me. So yeah, I'm going to walk through the basically the process for the film tax credit. All productions start out at GDEC and they get certified. And the next stage is the actual film itself. So there's proof production, principle, photography and post production. Felling post production, the production will submit their audit application to the department. So they begin their mandatory audit with either us or the third party auditor. And regardless, production company smits all their documentation and their audit workbook. So let's fill it on the website. They fill it out and the auditor's review it. The auditor's review the expenses and they calculate the days worked in Georgia and out of Georgia to determine which ones will qualify. And then they make adjustments and exclude any unqualified expenditures. So in the credit is calculated at 20% of the qualified expenditures. The unqualified expenditures are taken out of that total. And if it went through a third party audit, then department will review that after the completion of that audit and if department disagrees with those findings, we have the right to adjust the audit and the credit calculation. So if GDEC determined that they met the requirements for the 10% uplift, then they let us know and we then calculate that 10% off of the qualified expenditures. Same value that the 20% is calculated at. And then if production company disagrees with our audit findings, they can appeal those audit findings to the Office of Tax Policy, which is my team. So I guess the work with me. Then they report the credit on their income tax return and they can either transfer the credit using the IT transform or use the credit against their income tax liability. So initially in the audit, the production company's responsibilities are completing the application and submitting the audit payment. And then they can decide between working with us, so third party auditor with our review after that audit. Department's responsibilities are assigning an audit to begin those audit procedures and adhering to the audit procedures manual. And you guys want to use this QR code. It has a list of all the documentation or the other procedures manual. So Austin has copies for the committee. But this QR code will take you to the manual and show all of our procedures and require documentation and how the audit works. And again, so the once the production company provides all the required documents, then the audit kind of begins with a STR or not. And here's a leak to qualified. You know, expenders under qualified could be the type of expense one that isn't allowed under the code or the type of expense where it's occurred. So for example, if it's not a Georgia vendor or it's for time, for example, for the talent part of the time spent out of state, we don't allow the total salary or funds that are paid to the talent to qualify only the piece. For example, for the days that are in Georgia and for the work performed in Georgia. So certain other things, promotional days and other things aren't allowable under the credit. Again, there's some examples of some things that some common things that don't qualify, marketing, publicity, story rights, distribution, expenditure for work or not conducted or rendered in Georgia. And then the expenditures for goods that were not purchased rendered from a Georgia vendor. What we do is we have a, for example, for someone's renting equipment, they will have a sales tax number. They're required to have a sales tax number. We have a lookup tool that the auditors can use, the third party auditors or others or the production companies themselves can look up to verify the sales tax registration and that the sales tax registration was in place during the time for which the transaction occurred. In other words, if they're renting property, they're supposed to have sales tax registration, and they should have one during the period which the expense recurve. So they can verify that on our website. So that's pretty easy. One of the other requirements that are in, that's in the audit procedures manual is, is we look for local business licenses. Because if you're doing business, you should have a local business license. So part of our audit procedures are determining that there's an active business license during the period for which the expense occurred. And in our experience, we do, for example, for counties and cities, we have a program outside the sales tax program, counties can participate in to match business license registrations against sales tax registrations. So, so we can identify non-filers. Our experience is that if you have a local business license, it is darn near 100% you'll have your tax registrations. So that's a really good important control in terms of looking up, making sure they have a business license and then making sure they have the sales tax registration. So those are things that are easily available. So, so the productions will document that from the vendors they do business with. A little bit on George Vender, a sales rent services and ordinary course of business as a physical location. If it's tangible personal property, they'll be required to collect sales tax and again, has a local business license. These are the things you would expect that someone doing business, holding themselves out doing business, would have. So, so that's part of that. That's to find a little bit both in our regulation and then extensively inter audit procedures manual. There is an exception for certain services that are provided on the site. So if this is a box rentals, I guess would be a good example of that for individuals forming services on the site. There is an exception that it will qualify. There's also somewhere to loan out. So there's a mandatory withholding on those, which means we get gross withholdings on those pay. So if it's someone that comes in and goes out, although it may qualify, we're going to get the gross amount of tax that was due from an income tax perspective on that. And then that person can file their income tax return. Maybe that, maybe that, maybe that may be less. But we got gross withholdings at the full statutory rate on the work on site. If they don't do that and they don't do withholding, we disallow the expense. And then again, finalizing what talks a little bit about. We review the third party audits, issue the certifications for the final number that goes on there. There are some, which I think will be addressed a little bit in the next presentation in terms of the timing differences from 1037 to what it was before, before 1037. Projects didn't require mandatory audit. And then the tax credits were generated in one year and had a five year carry forward. Now under 1037, the tax credit is an issued until the audit is approved. And the certification is issued by the Department of Revenue. When that happens, that becomes the tax year that the credit is effective for. So for example, if it was a 22 project that required a mandatory audit and we issued the certificate today, that would be a 23 credit that could then be claimed against a 23, 23 return beginning next year. And one of the other changes is the five year carry forward also was a timing shift. Now that's a, you know, now that's a three year carry forward rather than what was a five year carry forward. And again, what's on the letter, the amount of qualified expenses is issued on there, the film tax amount. And then the certificate number that will match to the income tax returns. So when they claim their income, when they file their income tax return and they put that certificate number on there, we can match and validate that is there and how much is left, how much has been transferred. We keep a ledger for every credit in the system on every single taxpayer and also tells us the tax year to be used. So for example, if it's a 23 credit, we issued today that can't be used against a 22 liability. It can be used against a 23 going forward. Current credits or even under the previous regime before the years that it was created for which the production of provost were issued by economic development determined the tax year. But even then, they couldn't be carried back to prior years. And again, we've got codes we use for all of our credits. We have over 50 tax codes. 122 is the one for film. And they report what's earned. They have schedules for available years. We have those schedules as well. We keep a ledger for each one of them. So once it's used, it shows it's used. We contract with a went to. Also once someone makes a transfer.

and they make a sale, it's irrevocable. So that's kind of the way that works. So if someone purchases, for example, too many tax credits, the transactions done, they can't just reverse that back. So transactions can't move back and forth between buyers and sellers. So where you are basically, you know, high level is, but the audit procedures we put in that use the sampling, we very closely followed the performance audit that was completed by the Department of Audits. We looked at whether states did, and then we came up with standardized training for the sampling. We use pretty robust sampling techniques, as I think you hear about later. And then we also provide the software that you use for the sampling. So everything is done the same way. So when we review stuff, we can see what was done, how the sample was, that it followed the methods. We do have certain exceptions where we break out some of the categories, expenses that we like to see. For example, the DR or the accounting firms, we'll have to look at sort of the deal memos, which are the agreements with a talent in the production company, and they review those so they can look for things that may be in there that wouldn't qualify for the film tax credit. Maybe there are certain benefits or spousal benefits, other things that come with it, that are part of that. So we look in there for pieces and things that wouldn't necessarily qualify. We also segregate out certain expenses, airline fares, for example, we allow sort of one typical one per episode or for the most part. So that sort of puts a bit of a stopgap on folks just flying in and out every week and doing that. So that we just allow that. The other piece which is covered in the regulation, the Department issued number years ago, as it relates to hotel fees, we follow GSA per DM. So in other words, if they're reporting or claiming an expense for a hotel, we look to see that it doesn't exceed the GSA per DM. There, so that's part where the DR does it or third party auditor does that. That's part of the audit procedures. So it's really robust and tight program. Someone asked me, we were talking the other day, what would it take? What could you do to strengthen this program where we are now? And in my response is basically, the only way that the Department could strengthen this is if they did the accounting for the production companies at this point. That's kind of where we are. We're a couple years in, everything's mandatory now. Currently we have a little over 140 mandatory audits in the pipeline that the OR is working or third party farms are working. So as they come in working them fairly quickly, we're turning those around typically four to six weeks. The credits are getting out. So, and again, as we go through that, we'll go back and take a look at what our procedures are. We may decide to tweak a few changes that relates to sampling. We wanted to drive the vehicle for a while, see what we liked and disliked about it and may make some minor changes, things such as maybe for smaller projects, we take a look at what the thresholds are for certain items. Again, our change is that just to continually add to the efficiency, but nothing that would reduce the integrity of the program or the audit process. So that's the point for which the department is not willing to go beyond that if we think it impacts the quality or accuracy of the audits. And again, we think because we're getting so many questions from other states, we think we've got a good program, other people are taking our training now. So in terms of that, in the administration of the program, particularly since we use a lot of technology, it's very fast, very efficient. So from an administrative perspective, certainly, we don't lose sleep over anything. Because we think it's tight, it's efficient. So that's kind of where we are from a film tax per second. I'm certainly glad to take any questions. Any questions at the department? Chairman Hedge. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to share the question from one of our members that's not present. He is presently zooming from the coast of Belize. So I'm not going to say his name, but you all can imagine who's not here. His question is, can we get information that shows how much loan out companies are eventually refunded? Yeah, that is difficult. So here's the way that typically works. Let me explain why. You have the loan out companies, which have their own withholding registrations just like anyone else. Some may have a film. So they have a loan, so they'll withhold on the loan out. The production will, though, issue the tax forms to the loan out company, who will then claim it. Most of those are passor entities, so those end up on individual income tax returns. So there's two steps away from ultimately where that withholding is claimed. So when there isn't necessarily because there can be many loan outs, one to one, we don't capture every loan out in terms of what their number are to match ultimately what's claimed whether they follow return or not. We're concerned that withholding occurs at the point there and that we got our funds. So it's because people follow paper, there isn't really a good way to track that. So we don't have a specific number on that. Historically, at least during the performance halt that was done in terms of expenses, typically from a production perspective, loan outs typically run probably 60, 65% of total expenses, maybe a little more or less. To follow up on that with the loan out companies, they can be structured as a corporation, as an LLC, they can be structured however. And if they follow return in Georgia, we are a three factor state. So it correct, right? So if they follow return in Georgia, based on their hours in the state, based on if they follow, I mean, you can remind me how to exactly refer to the three factors. It's income, employees, et cetera, of the whole business. They could apportion themselves where they have very little of that revenue, that income coming for the state and then reduce their taxes to almost zero using three factor system, could they not? If they go to the trouble to follow return, could they not get almost all the money back if they were properly educated toward our three factor system and how to best use it, best to implement it? Sure, so let me explain a little bit. So at one point, from a corporate perspective, we were a three factor, we're a single sales factor state now. Right, which of course, if you're talking about, an LLC or corporate, the loan app, so they also could follow similarly. So they will likely pass through in their individual file, typically because we're collecting growth. So in most situations, they would be due a refund anyways because they have certain expenses, no other things they could normally deduct personal exemptions, those kinds of things. But because the way the apportion works, they would be able to apportion their income for what's in Georgia and without, and that's the same way other states would work. So they would most assuredly still owe us money. The question of how much that is depends on how much with in Georgia or how much is not. But that's no different than any other way, any other individual or other business work, but they would have it, Mr. Stop, so if I'll listen, Peter. In those cases, you put it out, it's a little bit of an individual, you did it with down 40% income, that's not the individual, that's right, the 40% income, they would file, counter it, and back to the current, whatever they could do, that helps with the risk of losing it, they pay 100% income back on that, they would have the credit, 30% if it's a big deal. Right, they would file the Georgia return based on their income in Georgia, and then they would get a credit in the other state. And that's why I was trying to do that sort of pain, so there's not a way that it could be a support in the order. Yeah, in the individual income tax return, we do have the Georgia income amount, and the everywhere income amount. That's why I'm going to ask, I want to ask, that they're not limited in what expenses like to lie off against any income. They would be limited to same expenses anyone else could write off in Georgia based on our adoption of federal code or any Georgia specific exceptions to that and subject on it. Yeah. Sure. We're a little behind schedule, so if there aren't any questions on the panel. I'm sorry. Can I have one? Of course, sir. Thank you for this. Hopefully I can say this in a way that makes sense, Mr. Cooke. I know you've since about 2015, we've generated about 5.2 billion in credits, and another 5.1 or 4.1 or so have been claimed. So there's 1.1 in outstanding, but you brought up something about 1037 that I hadn't heard before, and I'm wondering how, what your thoughts are on this. Since the credit is now not able to be obtained until after the audit, I was watching just a year after year, where you'd see like in 2019, there was 900 million in credits, and then you go to like 2020, and it's 500 million, and then 2021 it's 600. Then you have this huge fall off in 2022, down to like 140. Is that because the credit is now not tangible until after the audit? That's the first question. And the second sort of follows up on that is, so then what is that balloon or backlog to be coming soon? And we should expect to see over the next two to three years as the audits are finished. Sure. So 1030 definitely will affect the timing in terms of the credit generated because it will be generated later. Prior to 1037, a production company could estimate their expenses, monetize the credit, sell the credit, and then file their income tax return later, and true that up for whatever the final amount is. And then those were created in the years, basically for certificates issued by economic development. So if I had a project that was issued as certificate in 2019 and 2020, for example, the expenses that occurred in each year would determine the credit amount for each year, and then they would get the five year. So that was there. So currently under this, when they're done and after they finish shooting and come to us, or within a year after that, there will be a later delay on when it's been created. So we have 140 odd productions in the pipeline right now. And we expect there will be certainly more coming in. We take a look and track the file coming from economic development. So we don't know the timing of when they're coming in. So we have an idea of what we think is still outstanding. Now, 22 would certainly have an impact of 1037 because that's the second year in the phase in the first year, which was 2021. I think the minimum the spend to get you into the mandatory world was about 8.3 million, I think, if I remember the numbers correctly. And then that went down in 2022. So that picks up a lot of projects. So you're definitely seeing a timing shift there. You could be seeing shifts just in production and other things as studios cycle through their production cycle for some of the logger films as well. So that that could also impact it. But there's definitely a shift. What that looks like or when those are going to come in, that's hard to tell. We originally anticipated that later this year. There would be a bubble as people came in and then the push for those projects started to come in as the program was ramping up. But that will lag a little bit because certainly the strikes had a big impact on shooting and what's come in and certainly what comes into us. So there will be a timing like what that looks like and when they will come in is difficult to predict. Certainly some will come in later this year. There should be a good number, several hundred or more, 300-ish. I had to guess that probably we would expect to come in in 2024. And what the numbers are, kind of, depends on the size of the projects. You put the bottle, if there's a bottleneck on the audit, you'd say it's 300 million. Is that what I'm hearing or is it more? In terms of what's under audit right now? Right. I'm asking if there's a bottleneck at the audit now because it's 1037. Totally understand that. That explains why I'd have an anomaly in 2022. What is that bottleneck? Even though I understand it's under an audit, what is the highest it could possibly be so we can prepare a budget accordingly? So it's really a lag. So soon as either we do it or the third party CBAs do it, we're turning those around on six weeks. So it's really a lag because of the production and the shooting and when things are coming to us, not that we have a bottle. We just expected a large amount. So we're prepared to handle that to work through more than we typically were. Because with a three-year phase and under 1037, we expected that to happen. And then after that, then it's just sort of smooth, three, three, 400 projects a year. So it's hard to tell. We would probably have to look back at the dollars of estimated spend that are provided when they get a certificate to shoot that. But our experience is when we get to ultimately what those credits are. And we look at, for example, our numbers on the books versus the estimated spend at the beginning, our numbers are always less. By the time we get to that, because that's a pure estimate at the beginning. Yeah. And some of that may in terms of looking out at that horizon, may end up being covered under the Senate bill, six piece that's going on with that. Because we provided a lot of information to the folks providing that. That hey, not only is there a time shift because of 1037, that horizon changes. But we have a list of all the projects, what's come in, what hasn't that type of stuff. Thank y'all, Chester Kelsey. Thank you, Austin. Appreciate the information this morning. Next on the agenda, and I know who he is now, is Peter with Bennett Thrasher. And while he's making it up there, I'm going to back up for just a second and apologize because having lived this for a couple of months now, sometimes I forget myself. But as we've gone across the state, and we proceed to some other locations, we have focused in on certain sectors of our economy. And as if it was any big, huge secret film is one of our highlights or the highlight today. And DOR gave us kind of the 101 on film credits. And now we're going to hear from Peter. And I think he's going to talk a little bit more about 1037. But before I turn it over to you, Peter, we have two panelists that have joined us since we began. And we have been introducing ourselves and sharing our favorite movie, Debbie. If you want to start, you and Doc Brett. Every time I get asked a question like that, it's like I go totally blank. But I do love movies, and I have seen Barbie. And maybe that's a good thing to say. I'm Debbie Buckner. I represent House District 137, which is around Columbus, including Columbus, Fort Benning, LaGrange, Troop County, Maryweather County, and Tawbett County, my home county. And it's good to be in another technical college. I was in Thomasville yesterday on health issues. So I'm getting a tour of the state and the technical colleges. Thank you. Senator Ed Cobb County, thank you for this opportunity to be with you all. My favorite movie is by Burke Reynolds, the longest yard. Thank you both, Peter. Thank you, Speaker. My name is Peter Sathopoulos. I'm with Bennett Thrasher. I head up to entertainment practice. We're an accounting firm of about 450 people. Our worldwide headquarters is in Cobb County. We are in the top 60 accounting firms in the United States and grow in rapidly. And entertainment is one of the industry segments that's significant to our firm. My background is I grew up in DeCab County, went to University of Georgia Law School, had been working in the entertainment industry since about 2008, have always been involved in economic development. In fact, I actually started my career with the Georgia Department of Revenue. So anyway, the film tax credit program has been kind of a continuation of economic development practice that I've had for years. I think it's an excellent public-private partnership in that my firm works very closely with the Georgia Department of Revenue on performing these mandatory audits. We're one of the currently five firms that are deputized by the state to perform these audits. And because this was the first round after House Bill 1037 of doing these audits, there were a lot of questions about how they should be done. So we worked closely with Chester and the rest of his team at the Department of Revenue and how to do these things. So and it took a while to do. What I'm here to testify about today, well actually for I get into that, I forgot the favorite movie. My favorite movie is probably the Godfather series. The second one is my favorite. And I very rarely get to meet anybody cool in the entertainment industry because I'm involved in accounting. But I was driving through traffic one day and I get this call and it was this guy speaking bad Greek to me. And I was like, who the heck is this? I'm a Greek extraction, I speak Greek. And it was Francis Ford Coppola. So he needed help with something and it took me a few minutes to figure out who the heck this was. But that was kind of cool. We're getting a call out of the blue from the director of one of my favorite movie series. He's here filming a movie in Georgia called Megalopolis, which I look forward to seeing in the future. Back to my testimony. So House Bill 1037 had a material impact on the Georgia Film Tax Credit Program. And some of that impact had the effect of basically reducing the effective rate of the credit. So nominally the credit is 30%. But that is what applies to qualified expenses, which are not the total universe of expenditures made in Georgia. So production comes here, spends money. Some portion of that is not qualified. They apply for the qualified portion. And then on top of that, we perform one of these mandatory audits and we perform very rigorous testing procedures developed by the Department of Revenue, which results in a further disallownce of the credits. So as I'll get into in more detail in a few minutes, the effective rate of the credit is not 30%. It's much less in terms of the total spend in Georgia. Chester kind of stole my thunder as far as House Bill 1037, but I'll just quickly recap. One of the biggest impacts is the change in timing, also change the value of the credits. Before a lot of projects shoot over multiple years, and under the old rules before 1037, you would just claim the credit as you go. So you spend some money in year one, you claim those credits in year one, you spend some money in year two, you claim those credits in year two. Under 1037, the timing has now been pushed back to when the mandatory audit is completed. So for a multi-year project, you could not able to monetize your credits until possibly year two, three, or four, depending on how long the shoot period is and how long the audit is and the final approval of the Department of Revenue. So just based on a time value of money and that present value that had a downward effect on the credit benefit. The other thing that changed was the carry forward. So the credits used to have a five year carry forward. So you claimed it in the year that you spent the money, and then you could carry them forward for five years, or if you sold them, you know, a purchaser could use them for those five years. The carry forward period has been scaled back to three years now. So we went from a five year carry forward period to three year carry forward period. So the useful life of the credits was reduced. Another thing that happened is how we perform these audits in the air projection methodology. So before, let me preface this with our farm desis in multiple states. We started out in Georgia, but we kinda do these film tax credit audits in multiple states, including New York, Louisiana, Virginia, New Mexico, et cetera. The method used by Georgia to calculate the allowable expenses is probably the most conservative in the country that I've run into. So what most jurisdictions do is you sample from a large population of expenses, and then you figure out what the dollar value of those errors is, and then you divide that by the dollar value of the total samples, and you come up with an air rate, which you then apply to reduce that population, just using statistical projection methodologies. Georgia uses a more conservative methodology, which is based on you have to calculate using statistical software, what the lower confidence limit in the sampled population is, using a one-sided, 95% confidence interval, and then everything above that is disallowed. So not to get too boring about statistics, but that methodology is different than what other states use in results in a higher disallowance rate. So we typically, on our first few audits that we've completed have seen disallowance rates as high as 15%, probably averaging about 12 to 15% of what was submitted to us. So once again, the effective rate of the credit is likely less than 30%. The other big change is just record keeping, and just this audit is, once again, probably one of the tightest audit programs, if not the tightest in the country. So we are required to review thousands of records, literally thousands, including 100% of every deal memo for above the line cast and crew. So we have to read the full memo, figure out what the qualified comp is, and then allocate that to Georgia, based on the number of days those individuals actually spent working in Georgia versus elsewhere, and then we allocate their expense. And only that allocated amount is what ends up being qualified. And so we commonly disallow stuff for publicity, for instance, because that's not a qualified activity. If somebody spent a few weeks or a few days doing publicity that allocates some of their compensation to non-qualified, or they spent some time in development, because development's not a qualified phase of production. So in summary, I just wanted to say that, I think it's a very tight audit program, and I do think that the true impact of House Bill 1037 is only really just now being realized, because of one, the pandemic, and the shutdowns related to that, and two, it took a year or two to develop this audit program by the Georgia Department revenue and the CPAs that were deputized to do so. And so we're just kind of seeing the impacts of that program. And so I think it's yet to be determined, the true impact on the program. And with that, I will rest and see if there's any questions. Chairman Morton and then Representative Buckner, if that's okay. We on now, yeah, there we go. You referred to the credit going down. I mean, obviously we're interested in true facts, and you're in the accounting business, so are you. So I mean, if it'll be incorrect based on what the law in 1037, I don't think it's a bad thing to capture those. But you also mentioned the credit being worth less. Wouldn't you agree that the credit is to shelter income income tax? Yes, or it's it's in sense. In sense, the state income tax has gone from six to 5.75 or headed to 5.49. We hope to get to 4. That in fact, the dollar credit shelters more income at 5.75 and 4.49 than it does at six. So I mean, in reality, the credit is really worth about eight shelters, about 8% more income at 5.75 than it did at six, right? Yeah, if there's a reduction in the tax rate, in terms of it is, there has been and there's a projected other. So I just want to get back in there when you talk about it's worth less, it's worth more. If it's sheltering income, it isn't true as the rate goes down, the dollar credit is actually worth more. Yes, to a user or a claim or the credit. Thank you. It seems to me, I'm not the accountant in the room, but so if we have disallowed up to 10 to 15% so far because of the new audit process, is that not a cut to the tax credits available to the film companies? I mean, have we not already kind of done a back door film tax credit cut? In effect, I'm testifying that there was a reduction in value to the production companies in the credit because of the timing and because of the audit and disallowance rates. Yes, now that impact could be temporary, but yes, so far. So far. One more question. Please, quick. I know all of these changes because of the house bill have been put into rules and regs through the Department of Revenue. Yes. Would it give more confidence to the industry if those were somehow, at least the main points were codified rather than being rules and regs that can be changed easily? I think the nature, thank you. It's a great question. I think the nature of film tax credits because of the variety of expenditures that are involved in a typical spend, it would be very difficult to codify all of the different qualified and non-qualified categories. I think it would be very voluminous legislation. So far, the industry, to my knowledge, is extremely pleased with its relationship with the Department of Revenue. The Department of Revenue has an industry advisory committee, which meets regularly with the Department of Revenue, which I said on that advisory committee. And so we feel like the department and the state has been very responsive to the industry's questions and needs regarding this new program. Thank you. I'd appreciate you being here in your comments and we certainly want to work with you as the Senate sponsor of that bill. I feel like I got to speak up a little bit. But my thing would be that perhaps there were some things that, because they weren't being audited, we were, there were 31 states, you know, we too weren't doing the audits. We were one of them. Perhaps there were some things getting through. They're not getting through now. And we may be burdensome, but I was with some people last night that sitting in California that didn't even apply for it because it's a burdensome out there. So I don't want us to be burdensome. I want us to be fair in this, but we can certainly work with the DOR. I think they've done a really good job of putting in a system that makes us feel more comfortable that we're looking out for the tax plan, you know, what they're spending. Yes, Senator, I just declared if I was not saying that the programs overlead burdensome, I was, I think the industry is pleased with the program. It is tighter, you know, it's just it's, that was it's intent, I guess, was to tighten up the program and it's, it's, it's a lot tighter. It is tighter, but it also creates certain amount of transparency working together. Yes, sir. Okay, I got a question, Mr. Chairman. Please, I feel like we'd be remiss if the panel didn't take advantage of your expertise in this field since you've done audits in multiple states. Can you tell us the policy decisions regarding qualified and nonqualified at Spence's? How does Georgia relate to others? So do you see qualified at Spence's and other states that Georgia considers nonqualified that we should consider qualified? Or do you see any qualified at Spence's that we allow that other states don't that kind of sit there and shake your head about and wonder? Sure, I, you know, I think the big divide is between whether you allow above the line expenses, which is kind of unique to each film cast and crew producers or just below the line, which is kind of the

a standard cast decree. That's the biggest distinction. States that allow above the line expenses like Georgia were very comparable to those states in terms of what's allowed or disallowed. What states don't allow above the line? Let's see. I can't come up with a definitive list but I guess I better way to ask is the majority allow above the line? The states we compete with like New York allows above the line, New Mexico allows above the line. The states that we compete with allow above the line, I would say were comparable in terms of what we allow and disallow to those states. I don't see any more questions, Peter and I hope you'll forgive me for not trying attempts in your last name. Thanks for being with us. Appreciate the presentation. Thanks so much for the opportunity. Next we have Tony West from Americans or prosperity. His presentation there you are Tony. Okay thank you for being here. Thank you. I've been standing outside its packed room. Announcement real quick there is and next door here building B there is another room that has a live stream if anybody wants to. It doesn't have a single one to go over there. It's available right across the way. It's good to be here today. I know I stand between everyone here in the break so I can keep my comments brief and absolutely do my best answer any questions you have. Like I said thank you for the opportunity to speak today. I'm Tony West with Americans for prosperity. Georgia I'm going to use my comments just to kind of share our point of view on where we'd like to see the committee and the general assembly overall move in terms of what to do with our tax credits and our tax code overall and then close out with a policy proposal that we're happy to dig in in more detail after this committee concludes but can at least briefly share one thing we're thinking about. So at AFP we advocate for policies that will create an economy that works for all, empowering people to earn success and realize their potential. A simple fair and predictable tax code has the potential to unleash growth and innovation so that more Georgians have opportunities to pursue their version of the American dream. The first document that should be in your packets is just our principles for state tax policy. It's five broad principles we encourage lawmakers to consider with any conversations about our tax code including tax credits. One principle we aim for that is most relevant to today's conversation is equity, equity, equity ability. So lawmakers should eliminate all corporate welfare and special interest handouts that create a two tiered tax system. Tax policies should not pick winners and losers by providing favors to politically preferred behaviors, businesses, or industries. So as this committee is well aware the amount of money and credits exemptions, deductions that our state allows for annually significantly impacts the revenue or state collects. Our preferred approach for this committee to pursue is to see a significant reduction and special interest tax breaks so that the savings can be used for across the board reductions in our personal and corporate tax rates. I appreciate this committee's desire to take a fresh look at analyzing these many credits as this committee has already heard the way it's been done in the past leaves a lot to be desired but even the credit with the highest ROI is still money going to a politically preferred endeavor at the expense of the average Georgia taxpayer. The fairest and most geographically and socio-economically diverse ROI possible is when taxpayers are able to keep more of their hard-earned money and they're free to spend it how they deem to be appropriate not government officials. The lowest level of taxation possible while providing the necessary and effective government services we all want is a lot of a goal but this is also a matter of competitiveness for our state in relation to our neighbors. Our even though we're on a track to lower our personal rate over time we're still one of the highest in the southeast and our corporate rate is middling relative to our neighbors. In fact, last month, as many of you all know, North Carolina has to build to lower their personal rate to 2.49 percent by 2029 and they've been planning for a couple of years now to phase out their corporate rate altogether by about the end of this decade. And that's fairly important because as we all agree North Carolina is a competitor with ours in terms of quality business climate and attracting businesses to the state. Georgia should find ways to ensure our tax rates become don't become relatively high compared to our neighbors and eliminating corporate welfare and lowering tax rates for all corporations equally is a better way to attract businesses over the long term. Sunrise and sunset analyses of credits are important to ensure wasteful credits are never enacted and ineffective ones are removed from the books quickly. And that's when I do want to mention the second handout now because we think this idea of a comprehensive unified budget is a way that the state can systematically control tax expenditures instead of losing control if he will or trying to do one off attempts to gain control of these things. When we say a comprehensive budget, we mean that it's a budget that incorporates all spending and all revenue policies and the same budget document. Our annual budget is very transparent in terms of showing spending by revenue source. We do a good job there but we don't include in the document all of the credits deductions exemptions and exclusions that make our tax rates higher than they otherwise would be to finance appropriate government services. Putting it all together can help the general assembly consider the trade-offs and how to shift resources to better uses. For example, funds for economic development projects and foregone revenue for certain tax credits might be better used to reduce our personal and corporate income tax rates which would do more to support broad-based prosperity across the state. This idea isn't prescriptive in any way. They move to a fully comprehensive budget. We'll just increase members' awareness and their ability to manage holistically our budget every year while they manage other numerous budget priorities. So with that said, happy to answer any general questions and I'd be happy to follow up with any additional information on how this committee or the assembly can move forward trying to incorporate a unified budget. Thanks for being here, Tony. You were saying earlier, of course, we were talking before about above the line below the line expenses and it kind of is a parallel fault here. You're saying that a lot of this stuff is hidden. We get a budget that says here's your revenue but yet those and I've got two appropriations chairman here that maybe can correct me but it doesn't seem like those things are really listed as one of the things you know when we look at where we're going to spend our money that anything we do should be there and transparent in our annual budget process is kind of what you're saying isn't it? Yeah, that's right. I mean those numbers are out there. Sometimes they can be harder to find than others but incorporating them all in one document because we know lawmakers are busy. We know the appropriations process is difficult putting them all in one document so we can actually show where our money is going, what we're choosing not to collect and when these tough budget decisions are being made it would be really beneficial to have that there. Do you have a question? Just to point out, Tony, are you talking about something in addition to the expenditure report that is part of our budget and George? I mean I know it's preemptive if you will. This is money that we didn't get to look at but we list an expenditure report, tax expenditure report as part of the budget. Do you talk about something in addition to that? I would like to see at the bare minimum in the appropriations bill very very upfront and on the front end but ideally in an ideal state we're talking about making having concurrent bills to make changes as necessary with these tax expenditures. Okay, so you're talking about changing tax but not listing them because the listing is actually in the governor's budget from last year. I mean it's obviously can't be predicted but it's going for sure but you're talking about to wrap into the appropriations bill changes to the expenditure. That's the very fair enough. I just Tony if I could add to that I think that it makes sense to do that. It's good for everybody to have good transparency as we audit these and we get the actual return on investment I think we should be put in there is here's the amount of state tax dollars. Here's a return on state tax dollars as well as local so people can see the full picture if we're going to do it let's make sure we do it very methodically and accurately I believe you would support that. Absolutely. Thank you. Anybody else? I'm seeing other questions you don't grab us back a head of schedule thank you for being here. Happy to thank you very much. If nobody has anything we're going to take a quick five 10 minute break and then we'll get started back I will have an announcement or two at that point and see you back here in a minute thanks. There there seats had a couple of couple of announcements before we move into the next phase of our discussion this morning. We we're running a little long and running this a little differently than we have some of our other meetings so if there are some industry folks here with with film that want to make a comment or two after we kind of break it for lunch at 12 we will have some time for that we have some of that scheduled if you'll get with either Diego or David or Alex and let them know that you have that desire we're going to try to provide some time there there's a lot of folks that wanted to speak testify and then we also have a very special invitation from one of our local film partners here. Sure hey I'm Joel Harbor with Athena Studios and just wanted to extend an invitation to everyone here when we finish up today you're welcome to come to a tour of the studio we'd love to have you we're going to take a look at the stages and also the UGA Learning Center that Dean Davis mentioned earlier so we'd love to have you out and it's 890 Athena Drive and just a couple miles from here so look forward to seeing you there. Thank you Joel I understand it's quite impressive look forward to that um and now we've got a study I think we're going to be zoomed in here to discuss a study that's recently been commissioned and finished on the on the film and incentive here in Georgia not really sure who I can turn this over to do I I turn it over to Leon and yes please yeah Elinor y'all ready to go we can you can you hear us okay in the room we can we'll try to keep getting everybody to quiet down a little bit and you'll you'll get us started thanks for for zooming in thank you so much and thank you all for the for the opportunity to to speak to you today and to talk you through the research that we've been undertaking in Georgia for the for the last six months and my name is Leon Ford I'm managing director of Olsberg SBI and I'm joined by my colleagues Elinor Jubb who's associate director and economist and Kay Hughes who is a consultant with the firm and was the the project director on this study which is looking at the economic impact of the Georgia entertainment industry tax credit and just to talk you through the contents of what we're going to talk about we have five areas and this is very much some headline findings but I'll give you a quick overview of the study we're going to talk about the growth in film and television production spend in Georgia and in construction investment as well then give you the results of the economic impact study that we've undertaken and finally talk to you about the additionality of the credit as our as our research has found and then end with some conclusions so just to kick off with a quick a quick word about us Olsberg SBI as you'll tell from the accent is a is a company headquartered out of London London England but working very much globally including across the US in this sector in in film television and digital media we've been in business for over 30 years in this sector and we work for governments for trade associations for other organizations and private companies across across this sector including in states like Illinois, New Mexico, Utah and national countries from from New Zealand and Australia to to to most parts of Europe and beyond and most recently in the United Kingdom we worked for the government's revenues and customs department looking at the UK's creative sector tax reliefs and so we're very much specialists in in the sector and specialists in fiscal incentives and we believe that the analysis of these mechanisms of which we've seen a significant global growth needs a sort of specialist needs to be looked at through a specialist lens if you like there's you know it's a very specific sector with its own specific investment drivers and investment flows it's very much a globally connected industry and as we'll talk about later some of the jurisdictions that compete with with Georgia for production dollars you know are very much global although we're specialists this is very much an independent piece of work we we believe that sort of independently looking at these systems is very much an important part of their management and to you know ensuring that they're delivering return on investment for the jurisdiction they're operating in and for the for the funding of them the study we're going to talk you through is very much a holistic look at the credit and it may differ from some previous work you might have seen because of the the industry data that we that we have for this study we spent a long time gathering production data from investors in Georgia and also data from construction investors as well and we've we've brought that data together with with state

take to sources as well. And just before I hand over to Kaylee to talk about methodology, as I say this is very much a headline findings presentation. The full report is over 120 pages long, I think. So you'll be receiving that later this month and it has a lot more detail in all of these areas, including a very detailed methodology, which is very transparent about the approaches we've made in undertaking this work and some of the assumptions and data sources too. But thanks again and I'll hand over to Kaylee. Thanks Leon, hi everyone. So I just want to walk through part of the methodology, particularly around the data inputs that we had for this study. So as as Leon mentioned, we had both industry and states inputs for this study as well as data relating to both production expenditure, particularly incentivized production expenditure, as well as the studio construction investment. As part of this, we conducted a range of confidential consultations, over 36 consultations with members of George's film and television industry, studio operators and owners in the states, as well as incoming producers. So from elsewhere in the US or international who have produced in Georgia and then also members of the Georgia legislature and other key stakeholders as well. And then together data, we hosted two surveys. One was for recipients of the tax credit to understand the effect of the tax credit in attracting them to Georgia as well as what other factors may be involved there and Eleanor will be walking through some of the findings of that survey later on. This was aimed at both decision makers in Georgia as well as decision makers outside of Georgia elsewhere in the US. And the survey captured in terms of the number of respondents around 82% of the expenditure that happened in Georgia between fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2022. And then we also ran a really detailed data survey and data document with studio owners and operators in Georgia. So this was to gather the really detailed robust data on the investments they had made in studios, whether that was new developments, expansions or renovations between fiscal year 2012 and 2022, as well as forecasted expenditure leading up to fiscal year 2027. And this survey captured about 96% of the construction that occurred over that 10-year period between fiscal year 2012 and 2020. And then we also had a number of quant data inputs for the studies. So we had data that we received through GDEC, the Department of Revenue as well as production companies and the studio developers and operators that we mentioned. And then this was all underpinned with extensive desk research. So in any other studies that have been done in Georgia, as well as any other reports or articles that pertain to the film and television sector and an investigation analysis of the broader environment that the industry sits within in the States. And then most importantly was the economic impact modeling that we did as part of the study. So we used the implant software, which Eleanor will talk about as well in a little bit. But just to note for now that this is a modeling tool, economic modeling tool that's been used and developed over the last 40 years. And it's widely used by local governments, business professionals and academics. And it's used to analyse economic development policies and programs such as Georgia's tax credit. So I'm going to walk through the next section on the growth in production expenditure as well as the growth of studio construction investment in Georgia over the last 10 years. So in terms of the production expenditure, as you can see, there's been a significant growth over the last 10 years since fiscal year 2012, which is the period that we analysed for this study between fiscal year 2012 and 2022. And I think it's worth noting that there's been a really unique growth story in Georgia. We there has been an annual average rate of growth of over 17 percent between those two those 10 years between 2012 and 2022. And the state has done a really has done something quite remarkable in building such a strong industry that is not only one of the leading production hubs in the US, but also globally. And just to highlight the heights of 4.39 billion in fiscal year 2022. And that while there is a bit of a dip in fiscal year 2023 to 4.1 billion, we think that's likely a reflection of the impact of the labor strikes from the writers and acting guilds this year. And in terms of construction investment, so this is non-incentivized activity. This is and none of this investment is going through the tax credit, but is stimulated by the industry development that has has occurred because of the tax credit. So through our analysis, we found that between fiscal year 2012 and 2022, 1.28 billion was spent on studio construction in the state. So that was new developments as well as expansions or renovations on existing studio sites. And then in terms of anticipated spend, so when we researched and spoke to investors, there's about 2.93 billion anticipated expenditure between fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2027 expected across Georgia. And I think this speaks really well to the investor confidence in Georgia's position as a stable film and television market in the US and globally, and also the future of the state as a production hub. So I'm going to pass across to my colleague, Eleanor, to speak about the economic impact work that we did. Thank you, Kaylee. And hello everyone. So I'm going to talk you through first about the model that we used to estimate economic impact. Great. So this is a visual that summarises that method. So effectively, we've got a assessive inputs on the left hand side, and then a modeling approach and then the results on the right hand side. So in terms of inputs, we use lots of different sources of data, including production data from from GDEC, from production companies. We modeled the incentive estimates, and so estimates of the tax credits issued. We also input into the model studio construction data that we obtained from investors and in studios. We combine this with economic data, so from federal sources, such as the Bureau of Labor and Labor Statistics and also the Bureau of Economic Analysis. And then we also input into the model and the assessment of additionality. So this came from the surveys that Kaylee mentioned earlier, and it's really exploring how much activity would have happened in Georgia in the absence of the incentive. So we put this data input into the implant model. So as Kaylee mentioned, the implant model is a very well established model. What we were able to do is using some of the specific production data that we were able to obtain. We were able to tweak the model within implant to make it more relevant to this specific activity, so film and TV production activity. We run the models, they're numbers to be the model, and in terms of results, we get a number of different indicators from from implant. So the first one is output. This is a measure of activity. It's the measure of the results of an economic process that's available for sale or use elsewhere. It gives gross value added, which is GVA or value added, and this is a measure of the value created by an economic activity. And effectively, it's the difference between the gross output and the intermediary input. So what you put into a process compared to what you get out. A national level this aligns with the concept of GDP gross domestic product, and it's roughly equivalent to profit and wages. So you can see that that's a value of economic activity. We looked at jobs as well that in terms of able to estimate jobs. So these are annualised jobs. So a contract that lasts three months would count as a quarter of a job. It includes those who are self-employed and it can be part time or full time. Then we also estimated labour income, and this is the value of wages paid to people from as a result of the economic activity. And this includes the benefits that people get in terms of non-wage benefits such as health care. In plan also gives a result for taxes. So this is both state, local and federal taxes. And from this, we were able to calculate a GVA return on investment. So a GVA return on investment effectively, and we'll go into this in a little bit more detail. It compares the net cost to the state, which is the foregone tax revenue, minus the value of state and local taxes received, compares this to the GVA results. So that's a real measure of how much economic value you're getting for one dollar invested. And each of these results in plan, we get different effects. So we get the direct, indirect, induced effects. The next slide shows this in a bit more detail. So in terms of the direct effects, these are the impacts on companies directly working on production. The indirect effects are the effects on companies supplying the production. And induced effects are caused by the cast and crew and those working in the supply chain, spending their wages in the economy locally. So all together, this is sometimes called the halo effect. So that's the three areas together. So an example of this might be an indirect effect that the supply chain effect could be a local yum lumbia, that the production team purchases lumber for the construction of their set. And in induced effect might be a crew member purchasing lumber from the same lumber yard, but to use for their own project at home, for example, buildings and decking outside the house. So I hope that provides enough of background in terms of what it is that we're measuring in this study. Next for the result. At the end of this process, we looked at the impact of the Georgia Entertainment Industry Tax Credit for fiscal year 2022. And as you can see, overall, the tax credit has had a significant economic impact. In terms of gross value added, the overall effect is a around five and a half billion dollars in terms of GBA with over three billion in direct GBA. Economic output, the total economic output generated by the tax credit is eight and a half billion dollars. And in terms of the direct economic output, that's around four and a half billion dollars. Labor income also a significant impact. So in total, the total effect is around three and a half billion dollars in fiscal year 2022. And the direct impact of that, the direct component of that is around two point two billion dollars. So as you can see in one specific year, really significant impact. Now onto jobs. So this is for 2022. And I should say that this analysis combines both the production and the production impact and also the non-incentivized construction impact that we saw through our research. So in terms of jobs, we know that jobs in the screen production sector are well paid. So in terms of the average for the motion picture and some recording activities nationally in the United States, it's around the average annual wages around $86,000. And that's across lots of different occupation types. And that can be compared to the average wage in Georgia currently of around $58,000. So you can see that there's a significant significant difference there. The highly skilled, and I think you'll hear later about the skills that have been the skill development programmes that have been happening in Georgia around this. But it's a highly skilled, includes highly skilled occupation. And also we found that found and there's evidence to suggest that there's less it's less susceptible to automation in terms of jobs for the future. And it's creative and less kind of less kind of susceptible to some of those of those forces that play in the economy. So in terms of jobs in Georgia, the tax credit fiscal year 2020, when you combine the direct and indirect and induced effects, we estimate contributes around 59,700 jobs into into the Georgia state economy. This is made up of 34,600 direct jobs and then further jobs in the supply chain and in the induced induced effects as well. We also looked at the last five years and totaled the economic impact over the last five years. And you can see from this slide that the total value added created by the tax credit in those years in those last five years is nearly $20 billion of which around $11 billion are the direct effect. In terms of economic output, the picture is closer to $30 billion in the last five years with around half of that coming from the direct effect. Labor income, similarly a significant contribution, $12 billion for the last five years in terms of total impact and around 7.5, 7.6 billion in terms of the direct effect. So in terms of this, the return on investment. So the way that we measure return on investment connects directly with the intention of the program of it being about attracting inward investment, attracting this type of production and its economic development aims. So the way we calculate it is a measure of $1 of investment and how much economic value is created per $1 of investment. So the cost to the state is estimated at the total value of the tax credits minus the additional state and local taxes received. And this is compared then to the GBA. So across the whole study period, so this is the 10 years from fiscal year 12 to 22, the overall economic return on investment is 6.1. So this means that for every $1 of net investment in the tax credit leads to an overall uplift in GBA in the state economy of $6.3. You'll see from here that we've separated that into the direct effect, the indirect and the induced and those are summed together to get the 6.3 figure. This cost to the state, which is the Fugon tax revenues, are received one or more years after the production has happened. And Peter mentioned this earlier that effectively a delay in the payment of the Fugon revenue effectively makes the financial position of the state more attractive. It effectively reduces the value of the credits due to time preference and inflation. I'm going to move on to the next section and very well happy to answer questions on all of this at the end. So we're going to look now at there are evidence around additionality. So this is sometimes called the Butte for Argument and it's really about understanding what would happen in the state without the tax credit. So we sent a survey to producers and to investors in studios and Kayleigh mentioned we had a good response rate from both of those groups and the production survey that we undertook covered approximately 82 of expenditure in Georgia between 5th of the year 18 and 22. So we think it's a very good reflection of what's happening in the industry. So first of all we asked respondents to rank the decision factors about what brought them to or what caused them to shoot in Georgia. And as you can see from the from the chart the most important factor for both those based in Georgia and also those based elsewhere in the United States was the tax credit. Second was the facilities and infrastructure. Overall there isn't much difference actually in terms of those and the factors in terms of where a producer is based and it doesn't really influence their ranking very much. One of the next questions we asked so we asked that question first to ensure that there wasn't any anchoring around people focusing on the tax incentives and the tax credit specifically. But then we went on to ask production companies to estimate to the nearest 10% the proportion of their project that would have been made in Georgia in the absence of the tax credit. When we waited the results based on the scale of expenditure in in Georgia the result gave us the insight that 92.1% of expenditure would not have gone ahead without the tax credit. This is really a very important finding though we can be confident that a lot of the expenditure that's happening in Georgia currently would just not have happened if the tax credit wasn't was not there. We should also mention that this is not a unique finding to Georgia that this kind of is corroborated by other evidence from other jurisdictions. Just about the importance of credits for attracting production. In terms of the studio construction so Kayleigh showed you earlier just how much studio construction activities happened and how much is planned for the coming years. What we found is that this studio construction activity is highly dependent on the tax credit system. They covered about 96% of construction activity between 2012 and 2012 and 2012 and 2012 and 92 and 94% of respondents asserted that their investment would not have happened or would have moved elsewhere without the Georgia tax credit. When we wait that based on the scale of investment it's very close to 100% would not have happened. That last 6% actually doesn't account for very much in terms of production or a construction expenditure. A similar pattern is found for future planned investment. The survey indicated that all of the planned construction expenditure is very dependent on the tax credit. I'm going to pass back over to Leon just to conclude. Thanks, Alan. Yeah, and just a final few thoughts on in terms of conclusions. I think as Alan has explained, we found that the tax credit in Georgia was creating significant impact across both incentivized production and non-incentivized construction. We did some modelling in the study around how that spend moves around the economy in Georgia and looked at the type of jobs that it was creating. As Kayleigh says, screen productions require a large amount of inputs in terms of different types of jobs, different types of supply chain. It's very much a type of advanced manufacturing activity. There's lots of impacts in terms of the jobs it's driving. As we said when looking at the expenditure growth, Georgia has been really successful in developing an industry ecosystem that has really driven growth very markedly, particularly in an era of increasing competition for production. Currently there are around 117 such incentives at a global level, including about 37 US states. Really for Georgia, the credit is a cornerstone piece for the growth in state, but worth also noting the talent in state, the infrastructure, and I think what's well recognised as a gold standard training offer, Georgia has been very successful at rapidly developing its industry training through the Georgia Film Academy and other providers. I think just underlining the fact Georgia has done this when other jurisdictions are also competing with it and looking to get those production dollars. So that concludes the presentation. Thank you very much for your attention. We're happy to answer any questions and our emails on screen if anybody would like to follow up with us separately. Thank you. Okay, thank you all for the presentation. I know we've got at least a couple of members with some questions, but let me ask a few up front and we're very familiar with the implant, our fiscal audit department here uses it. We put indirect, we put indirect induced, so maybe we're more familiar with this than maybe some groups would be. Our multiplier was 1.84. I guess maybe you've got some slides that aren't here. I didn't see it. It looks to me like about a 1.89, which would be reasonable, is what was the multiplier you used for this in the implant model? Yes, that's right. So as you know that the multiplier has been implicit in the implant and it does work out with the output multiplier to be about 1.89 and the GVA multiplier and the jobs multiplier is slightly different. So the GVA multiplier is 1.71. Okay, and then in the first slide, I think you did Elmer, which was slide 9, you talked about state and local tax revenue, but there was no fiscal ROI in the report. We always have a fiscal ROI and it's talked about in the beginning, but when you talk about the results, I don't see anything there on that. Yeah, that's right. So we tend not to secalulate fiscal ROI really because of the overall aims of the program are aligned more to an economic judgment in terms of that being the return on investment that we tend to use in this situation. I don't know what the Leon you want to come in on that point. No, just to agree with that, I think it's, I think we feel it can be a misleading metric given these generally are set up as economic development tools rather than sort of fiscal or tax generation tools. Well, it's important to us if we're going to say what's going to be impact on our state revenue and we do something that's certainly important to us in the fiscal audit department here does a pretty good job with it. And these historically come back pretty low compared to a lot of the other tax credits that are out there. Now, you used, um, trying to remember the number was at 92.1, you said because of not everything being there was the number you were using. I didn't see that in the final calculation. You used 92.1, it looks like the 100% was used again down there. So yeah, so that 92.1 has been applied to the production expenditure before it was went into implant and then the construction expenditure that was the 100%. And so, but the results have been combined for the purposes of this presentation. Okay. And when we do, you know, surveys, I guess I would give an example, it doesn't really come to us, but in the metro area, we have developers that have bought property that broke ground, but then they're saying, well, we wouldn't build it unless we get the tax credit. And it seems like that might not be necessarily the most accurate way of finding out the the but for. And I was looking at a separate Georgia State report here. And it looks like Florida on their report with their numbers. Now, they're a little bit more inflated than your numbers, but I'm comparing apples to apples because Georgia was there higher to you, but basically Florida looked like they were about 70% of Georgia with no tax incentive. North Carolina was a little over half with a cap of 31 million of Virginia was a little over half with trying to remember what their cap is. I won't say it's like 11 million. So, you know, I have a hard time saying, here's somebody that's got a fraction of it that's doing over half or two thirds of the stuff, but yet almost 100% of it is due to this tax credit. It just doesn't seem to, I mean, it seems like that should be considered in these studies. What happens in other states when there's no tax credit there when there's a minimal? No doubt it has brought jobs to Georgia. No doubt it's been a boom to get companies come here, but it's just the percentages. I don't know that I'm comfortable with a survey of people saying, what would you do if it wasn't here? I guess that's what I'm saying. Yeah, and we do try and minimize that respondent bias. I mean, we don't go straight in asking about the tax credit. The survey questions are quite carefully structured, not to lead, not to lead any respondents. We tend to offer the answers alphabetically, for example, and things like that. But I think with the comparable jurisdictions you mentioned, I'm not familiar with the numbers, but that you mentioned. But we can certainly take a look at those offline and come back to you, but I think in terms of industry size, if that's what you were referring to, I think the and Peter from Bennett Thrasher mentioned this earlier, I think in terms of the jurisdictions that Georgia competes with, they're thinking of New York or British Columbia or the UK, which get very high levels of production. They offer very similar incentive packages, rather than some like Florida, which doesn't offer an incentive package at state level.

All right, then the last thing I'll say is, you know, there's the butt four there, which I think we should look at other states, but also the instead of I don't think there's anything here if this money was used elsewhere, what would happen? That's how we our fiscal audit tries to get a net amount by saying if this money was used elsewhere, what's the average return on it? To come up with what this is actually doing for the state. Yeah, it's a great question. I think for this for this study, it's not something we we modeled in terms of how, you know, in terms of how spend could be redeployed in other ways, I think. You know, you know, the RV would be that it, you know, as an economic development tool, it should be sort of compared with other economic development tools, but I don't know, Eleanor, if you have anything to add to that. All right, thanks for your answer. Thank you. Thank you. I had a couple of questions. We're getting serenaded here. I don't know if you guys can pick it up over a zoom, but we got a phone in the background. A couple of questions about the numbers. I'm a numbers guy. I saw a number of people here on the panel. So I'm looking on one of the slides. I had a total of 59,700 jobs that were direct and direct and do. That's right. I mean, that's, I'm reading that correctly. And I know there's other things and this is a gross simplification of it, but just doing the quick math back of envelope math on that 60,000 jobs at an average of 80,000 at 5.75% income tax generates 276 million dollars. We're spending 1.3 billion to get that. I mean, I know there are, and again, I know there are other things local, but just from an income tax, am I am I am I'm missing anything with those numbers Eleanor? Sorry, I just saw following your math. So you're saying the jobs multiplied by the average wages and that gives the total in terms of the amount of the kind of effectively labor income. Is that what you're, that's what you're trying to calculate? Exactly. That's gross income. That's not even assuming there are going to be deductions, which would would lower that amount, but that's the grossing effect. Am I hearing your numbers right? You said 80,000 dollars for an average job. You actually said that was in the business. I'm applying that to induce jobs. So I'm applying that to somebody working at McDonald's, which I think actually moves it up, maybe, maybe a little higher. I'm just trying to see if those are the am I correct in ingesting your numbers correctly. Yeah, so I mean, my preference will be to use the labor income figures to calculate the labor income because of effectively then that that utilizes the right wage average wages for each of those sectors because obviously as you mentioned. Fair enough and again, that that's I was where I was going next because you said induced impact is 2.61 billion dollars. Maybe my math's wrong here, but I divided that by 15,300 jobs, which is the number of jobs you had and I came up with an average wage of 174,000. Am I okay? Dig it off there. I think I'd have to look at that a bit offline in terms of those calculations. I mean, I think, yeah, there is implicit average wages in implant. And because we because of the data years that we've had to use an implant, there's a slight differential from the number that I quoted at the outset, but it sounds to me like there might be something off with the calculation. You divide 2.6 billion by 15,000, you get a roughly 174,000. And so that was where I was going to try to get back. I don't question we value the industry, you know, we're talking about the tax rate. Nobody's targeted per se, but when I get numbers like this that I look down and go, where could that, how could that be? I would need some clarification on how 15,000 people make 2.6 billion dollars in the induced. I mean, somebody must be coaching football someplace. I can definitely look out the average wages for that part of the calculation if that's helpful and we can we can revert on that. That would be great in the direct and in these things. Yeah. Thank you. Just following up, you got a bunch of math people here. So it would be helpful if you could provide the more detailed analysis and the numbers behind that that might help to either further prompt questions or maybe clear up some confusion. So, I'll have a couple other quick questions. You make sure I understand you surveyed the folks who are doing films in Georgia today. Is that the sole source of your analysis? For the survey aspect for the additionality aspect. Yes, so there was other data use for other aspects of the study. We were talking about different areas. In fact, we talked about British Columbia, New York, California, London, etc. Did we do any analysis of again, the differences of what's happening there based on what's self reported here. You know, this is a little bit siloed right now and again, your bunch of data junkies here on this committee, right? So we're looking for the bigger picture. What other outside influences analysis to look for because to me, that's what the but for argument is really about. Right, because if the but for means you have other options and you go to different places, you know, how do we look at how some of the other competitors did. Yeah, and that's definitely something we're, you know, we're we're very close to as a company, as I mentioned at the start, we do a lot of this type of analysis in in different jurisdictions. So thinking of thinking of the UK, for example, where we're based, you know, the spend last year was, you know, was over six, you know, six billion pounds or around seven billion dollars. And I think the, you know, as I say, this is an industry that has grown in terms of content investment in the last 10 years and just as Georgia has increased, we've also seen key markets that are able to offer, you know, incentives and infrastructure and and a crew base have also been developing as well. So I think in terms of competitive position, you know, there are there are the major markets around the world, thinking of, you know, you mentioned British Columbia, the UK, Ontario in Canada. And that's, you know, that's. Those are all markets that have grown very quickly as well as as Georgia. And I think the drivers are very much, you know, we're in a period of very high cost inflation for productions. And as, as we mentioned earlier, this is a sector that is is very sensitive to to these sort of incentive models. They help guide where productions are cited around the world and, you know, these, some of these shows can have very very high budgets and carry with them a lot of financial risk for the investors. So finding somewhere like Georgia that has a very stable and good business environment and a very stable incentive, as well as the infrastructure we've talked about and and the sort of crew base is a, you know, makes it a very competitive state. And one final question, when you look at the analysis, especially getting back to the but for. There's a let's say someone moved and invested in the community seven or eight years ago, they have built infrastructure, they have built talent, they've got everything there. Their but for answer would obviously have swayed differently than the person was thinking about relocating here and moving here for the first time. Did you take that into account during your analysis? That's a really interesting question. We didn't model that specifically and I think. I guess what the results of our survey, it does incorporate those people potentially who've decided quite recently to move over, help production in Georgia. And also those people who probably made that decision quite a long time ago, I think the results of the survey are really clear that actually the tax credit does play a very important role in that decision making across the board. Really, there are very few responses to say that it doesn't matter. And so I think in terms of the analysis that we've done and it perhaps suggests that it may actually still be quite a similar result and even within those two. And I think that this is underlined by evidence that we know from other markets that the production is very mobile. It's a very mobile and global and globally connected industry. Thank you for your answer. I'm sure everyone you you spoke to agreed that the tax credit was critical to their business. That's probably not a surprise to anybody, but I do believe that we're going to be intellectually honest in the way we're approaching stuff. We have to separate out those who we've attracted who are here and already have the infrastructure in place versus those who are trying to come in. And that's the way we would do most any other economic development projects for the state. It's just it's a different way of looking at things clearly, but I think it makes a lot more sense for us understand the short, medium and long term impact. Thank you. We get Jim Taylor you want to. He is deferring to you. Thank you for your report. I have a question. I'm like. Our understanding is a lot of these credits aren't necessarily used by the film companies themselves that they're turned over sold or transferred. Does your report take into account any of the transaction calls associated with that transfer to figure out what the actual impact to the company is. I've heard some anecdotal evidence people tell me you know it's 88 cents on a dollar or something like that, but I've just not seen that you all have anything that shows that. And how does it impact your analysis. So we heard a similar figure to you around that from from our consultation process. It's not something that we've modeled specifically because our focus has been on the cost, the cost to state in terms of folk on tax revenues. And then the impact of the of the production or non incentivized construction activity. And then we see that that tax benefit that's seen elsewhere in the economy would have an effect as well. But we haven't been able to access data that gives us a clear picture of that across the board enough to be able to model it. I was Senator Redd I was just going to say we have a quite a few number of people here which I can appreciate as a matter of fact the whole representative button here. Buckner here half a penny I'm still trying to figure out how to pay her on that. But I noticed when you talking about industry growth that between 2012 and 22 FY22 that about over a billion with spin on studio construction in a state which shows investor confidence. And the confidence in Georgia is strong to pay that cost out of pocket. But you combine that with the multiply effect that can have quite economic boom or not only just Metro Georgia but also rural Georgia just to comment if you have any thoughts you can expand on that. I think we definitely agree it's you know as Anna says we we spent a lot of time in consultations sort of digging into how investors felt about the state and certainly you know the confidence that Georgia was being able to build. And the track so much film television production was a was a you know was a very key factor in in those investors sort of you know coming to coming to build in the state. Well I think we're you know going to wrap it up there I did have a couple of thoughts I know you'll unpack this thing and through the presentation together kind of you know right on the heels of it being completed so I know there's going to be some other things to discover maybe some other questions that come up a couple things that might be helpful based on some of the questions that I heard being asked maybe were that if you have you know another other industries based you know on similar incentives. What would their growth look like over the same period and you know impact look like I guess the other thing would be for Georgia specifically and you know having grown up here you know I could only anecdotally talk about it but you know how many productions how much was going on prior to you know this particular change you know regarding the incentive so. Thank you very much for your input appreciate your time and zoom in over at what I'm sure is a interesting hour in London. Thank you very much all right thank you again moving on I should. We have panel set up and I believe Frank Patterson is here the president of Trilla studios I know he is a song earlier. While he's making his way up to introduce our panelists I did see one of our local representatives Marcus wheat hour joined us Marcus thank you for being here did I miss anybody else sir. Thank you thank you thank you Mister chair Mister Patterson floor is is yours and your your panelists we look forward to the discussion. Thank you Mister chairman and thank you fellow assembly members I'm have the honor of introducing three panelists colleagues all of whom are representatives are kind of a sampling of the ecosystem of support here in the state of Georgia. And I'll have different stories represented different part of that ecosystem. I think we all know what some of that outcomes of that steady said which is what are the reasons why these productions come to the state of Georgia right the tax incentive. The second was the infrastructure and the facilities and of course the third was the crew. And this group here is part of that ecosystem for that number two. And I thought I do is I'm going to let and by the way by way of introduction. But gas battal who's a CEO of of B.I. production works it's amazing sort of Georgia boy made good story taking two trucks and putting them into a multi million dollar business he'll tell you more about that. And then Kate McCartle who an executive for 20 something years in the movie business decided to commit all of her knowledge and resources and education she serves the director of film workforce at the Georgia film Academy and then. Missy Martin who is a president of a Cherokee office of economic development has some really interesting insight into the impact on community. So you kind of getting a cross the board look at the infrastructure of the state of Georgia and this is just a sample. And then what I thought I do is we'll each just take a couple of minutes and describe what it is we do. How it is that we've grown into success and how we look at the future. And by the way I'm Frank Patterson I'm the CEO of Trillis studios in Fayetteville and I'll kick it off by saying that. We now have 32 stages and more than a million and a half square feet under roof at Trillis studios but Trillis studios is just a part of Trillis. And what is this place by show of hands who's been there. Oh wow okay that's great. It's a place we think of it as place making more than we do studios. It's a place that we the vision is to have every resource that storytellers need to do anything they can imagine. And looking at those numbers but the old bird team put together. It's not representing all the sort of investment dollars we've put into the dirt because we're including a town. So Trillis has a studio with stages and a million and a half square feet under roof we have a town where about 1100 people live right now to be built design for about 5,000 people. We have retail and education in fact we have 65 businesses at Trillis that represent over a thousand FTEs and this is all of course centered around storytelling around the film industry. And I can tell you very emphatically those dollars would not be invested haven't personally raised and invested hundreds of millions of dollars in Trillis they would not have been invested without the tax credit. It's the components that I'll tell you the investors need and that comes with a tax credit and really the reputation at the state of Georgia has and has had for being a state that is very good to businesses into business environment. And so I can tell you that our investors saw that stability as critical to making what's over a billion dollars of investment in the dirt just at Trillis right now with a plan another 700 million dollars 300 million already underway. So as one who represents investors I'll tell you that confidence comes from this policy environment in the long history of Georgia being a great place to do business. It also comes with knowledge that our productions the productions that are that make up our business feel confident in those three requirements a great tax credit infrastructure with businesses that really know what they're doing. And then incredibly well trained crew base that is key to the reliability reliable outcome for these productions having been in other states full self disclosure here I served on committees for two governors in the state of Georgia I'm sorry state of Florida. Having watched why productions come and how incentives work because a state tax passes a state incentive or a tax incentive in the film industry it does not mean that state is going to be successful. I'm sure Peter and Stephen and others here can give the list of states that have failed in the film industry believing that the tax credit was the reason why it happened. It just doesn't if private capital doesn't come to the table behind it and that private capital has to be feel confident in the policy environment that it won't work and if the crew is not reliable productions consider the expense too great and not worth the benefit that they get from the credit to fly in the crew and to build the infrastructure necessary for their productions. So we at Trilleth what we feel like we've done is put this billion plus dollars into the dirt to create a stable reliable environment that productions can trust and we are you know sister organizations to a lot of facilities around the state that are doing the same thing so. Just a note about i'm going to ask each of us to talk about what we do and why we're successful and a little bit about oh by the way i can't name my favorite movie without naming something from Trilleth because if i name something other than what something shot at trilleth so probably Avengers in game okay i'll tell you the real movie in a minute later offline when we think about the future and future growth of trilleth i'm going to speak for trilleth by the way try list. We're investing in facilities we're investing in technology and we're investing in content by the way my auditor is in the audience here so i have to be very careful Peter just okay. The facilities business is easy to understand in this survey data and everything that was talking about the value of this credit that's great and that's why we're the number three state in the nation in terms of value from the film industry. How many of our values being left on the table we at trilleth feel like that value resides in the IP associated with content and the technology necessary to exploit that content so we're a close third. There's third in the United States as a marketplace when it comes to the value from facilities and infrastructure we are a distant third significantly distant when you consider the value of that IP. What i mean is by comparison if it's nine billion dollars worth of value in the state of Georgia compared to New York's fourteen billion dollars of value from the facilities infrastructure it's seventy two or three billion dollars for New York in terms of value including the IP so we're distant third. We think making investments in content companies and content creators in the state of Georgia is it's how we're going to capture the future value of this industry and i would argue that's not being measured in these studies because i it's not relevant right now but for my investors in the way we see the future it's critical for the growth and the value of our company Georgia has a lot of bright talented content creators in this marketplace that we haven't been exploiting. As an industry and that's where we're investing dollars in the future and that's where we see all the growth happening now the gash if you don't mind, it's a little bit about how you went from two trucks to really a company that we rely on in the film industry for transportation equipment rental every day. Definitely good afternoon everyone my name is Bougesh Patel I also go by Ben Patel many of you know me by that name my favorite movies fifth element. Bruce Wallace it was you know when I was a little kid and I've always seen that you can think of it it's possible and I think the world today shows you that what we thought about twenty years ago was not possible it's definitely possible today and on top of that especially United States of America. So I was born in India moved to United States when I was seven years old actually moved to Kinesa and then slowly migrated to Madison right in the year the Olympics were here. So I remember small town you know I was the the only Indian kid in town so everybody thought I was Puerto Rican because they didn't realize there was a continent that was India and and you could be brown outside of that. So it was great I took I took whatever it was you know one thing that I learned in a small town is personality means everything relationship means everything right yes sir no sir yes ma no ma respect goes long way in the southern states as that we live in so I built that in in myself especially going through schools and high school obviously. There was a one important lesson that I learned in high school was you know what. The world I would live in you got to get along with everybody right if it's white blue black green whatever it is to be successful and obviously not being India since I moved here in seven since I was seven year old I migrated back to India when I was 18 after after high school and I realized at that point when my dad left India. That there was an opportunity that he was seeking and that was the reason he migrated to America and if I was there and my dad never came here we would have had probably one acre of land to grow in sugar cane and that was my future so when I'm sitting there and like wow I'm in America and all I have done is try to get as many girlfriends I can have have all the fun that I can and never dream or have a future so. At the age of 18 I don't know what kicked in spiritual religion I did a complete 180 and realize that I have to dream and soon as I came back to America after being in India for a month and a half. I bought a dry cleaning operation at the age of 18 or 19 at this point in Madison Georgia and I've had some experience in dry cleaning throughout high school working as a high school job so. I went to Mr. Pasco that did movies in Georgia for Hollywood in the 80s 90s even 70s when Georgia was all about just Georgia pine trees southern film shooting so it wasn't the tax incentive but it was one movie out of the year two movies out of the year and Mr. Pasco which I think is the smartest guy in the world he's my Albert Einstein he's still living 84 years old my mentor and he said his movie from heaven. And I was like what do you mean so I never you know I never paid any attention to that while I was working for him and when I got out of high school and. Turn my life around and I'm dreaming so I'm just fast can you tell me what that movie from heaven the money from heaven means and right at that time I bought a business in 2006 a dry cleaning operation for $100,000 or $50,000 in credit card debt where you got these checks in the mail and I fill that everyone knows checks. Cash them in the bank account and I realize oh shit it's 30% interest rate well that wasn't and it wasn't bad right because at that point I was probably at the most bottom part of my life for me and my family can afford school I didn't want my mom to continue clean rooms at a hotel and my future wasn't to pursue high school or pursued education so. So I can't can't go any lower than where I'm at so if that means I got a debt everything out we'll do it first show we are Marshall thanks to everybody that's here and even people that were here before you guys we literally clean football jerseys night and day at the corn laundry and we made over $200,000 to pay off the high interest debt that we had. I literally at that point saw that if you really work hard and I believe in this powerful energy of leaving God that if you put your effort in your mind to it is possible so I don't have the privilege as Trilleth does of having a $300 private investment money so that's okay I'll go with my 30% debt to start a business slowly after that I married my wife from Paris France she came to Madison as a change student I met her during their mat is last year. I was like you marry me I will make Madison Paris France for you you got a marry move here and if you ever have a chance to come by be our production work you will really see it is a true art of business again thanks to the film industry that we're in 2015 fast forward we want to have kids my wife's like well you got to be home now kids and what she means by that is in the dry cleaning operation we had a retail business that was from six o'clock in the morning to six o'clock in the morning at six o'clock in the morning, six in the afternoon well right after seven o'clock filming stop shooting and then we're picking up clothes at night bringing them back cleaning them and we have eight hours turnaround so before four to five a.m. the clothes are back on so we're actually working twenty hours a day whatever it took obviously keep the retail going and the movie from heaven means it's the off hours that you're working that is not costing you as much as money as retail operation is. So in 2015 Athens is one of my mouse zone. Athens Mercedes dealership. We're doing Hunger Games and thank God that North Carolina lost their tanks and tax incentive and Hunger Games ran right out of North Carolina, came to Georgia and we were cleaning so much clothes we needed to van. Well, when I was buying a cargo van for the cleaners, I saw these passenger vans and that brought me an idea. Well, okay, my wife wants to be at home. Maybe it's an easier job. All I have to do is buy vans and rent the vans of production because I can fool anybody if I have the right product. So now I'm gonna take where they're using the Ford, I'm gonna take a Mercedes and I'm gonna sell my story on a Mercedes van that is better than Ford. Obviously I didn't know anything about vans or anything about transportation, but I knew my relationship ability and what the film business wants is service, right? And it's dependability and how can you deliver? So a bar of van from Athens Mercedes dealership took it to Game of Silence, which Neil was my first transportation coordinator. Again, this is a very close niche business. So I needed an intro. So my favorite costume supervisor, Leslie, said Ben, follow my lead. And again, I'm married, have a ring on my hand. I don't have it on today. She's like, hey, me, Neil, meet my boyfriend Ben. I need your rent vans from him. So that started my story because of that comment from Leslie, Neil said, okay, I'll rent vans from you. At that point, guys,

I had a price and nobody ever takes us back to any production, but my price was $400 per week on a van. Well, I didn't say anything. Neil was like, I'll give you $5.85 done. So I left there, bought vans. Fast forward with this story. Today we started with one van, not trucks, vans. Two vans actually, and bought those. And since then, to 500 pieces of equipment, we bought vehicles because our customer wanted that because they can get that from California, New York, or even Georgia. And what I learned in this business is that you have to listen. And I think that's where we're here today. We're listening to demands. This all of it makes sense. No, they want the world, but they want the stars, but let's give them the moon. So I go to these departments and I'll listen to what they want. And being able to do that, it keeps you humble. It allows people to help you. Any time you go to a room where you're not the smartest guy, and you listen to people, it helps you build a business. Today, after hard work of 100 people in our company that are all in Morgan County that have moved from other towns, Eden 10, Putnam County, Eden 10, Greensboro, all these other towns, where the largest employer in Morgan County has small business, where the largest taxpayer in Morgan County. And yes, it is big enough. We have a low as in Walmart. And Chick-fil-A obviously. So we're not trying to beat a small company. But what this incentive has done for me is it has made my American dream possible. It's okay to dream. And I think everybody in the world dream, but those dreams are not possible everywhere else. And if I look back today, and if I wasn't in this country, if I wasn't in this state, my dream would have been possible. If the votes and understanding what the film business has done, this is a Hollywood story. One day this will be a story of mine because I feel like we are losing the touch of the American dream. And I sit here today as a prime example of if you want it possible, you got to be in this country. And I take that very strongly disciplinary and it kills me to see why people don't try when they're in this country. The worst day of anybody's life here is the best day in countries that I've been. My thing, one thing that reminds me this every year and what drives me on a day-to-day basis is a trip to India every year to make me realize that, hey, this is where you would have been at. And right from January, December, you get into this world of Western culture and it brings me back down to earth and I start back over in January and that's my fresh start every year. And I think that's very important for us to understand what this has brought to Madison, what this has brought to Georgia and what it does for people like me that cannot get the investor, that don't have the right to dream in other countries and come here and make it possible. Thanks, Bigash. You are underscoring what a very well-known producer who we won't name, who you and I both know said just recently to me, there's nothing compares to the work ethic of Southern culture, the crew in the Southern culture. It's interesting, your work ethic is really lottable. And thanks for that story. And what you've done in your county and it reminds me of what Kate and the workforce development team there at the Georgia Film Academy has been doing really across the state and thinking about what our next workforce is going to be and how we can leverage rural Georgia, the real untapped talent in this industry and the Georgia Film Academy has been really successful spreading itself across the state and can you talk a little bit about that for us? Yes, thank you. And thank you for your story. It's so inspiring. And speaking of two things that you talked about. One is opportunity for people in far-flung places that wouldn't ordinarily have had an opportunity. And I think that was one of the reasons that the Georgia Film Academy was created to begin with because in 2015 the former governor said, wait a minute, exponential growth in the productions coming to Georgia because of the tax incentive. But not nearly enough Georgians being trained in the below the line crafts that will allow them to be employed in this industry. We need to solve that problem. The former governor Nathan Deel said a side in appropriation to create the Georgia Film Academy. He hired the first executive director, who's my former boss, Jeff Stepikov sitting over there. And we were tasked with creating curriculum to train people in what are called the below the line crafts. I think most of you know what those are, but they tend to be the hands-on jobs on a movie set. So we weren't tasked with creating at that time writers and producers and directors, but grips and lighting technicians and set deck and props and art department and so on. We created some initial curriculum and the curriculum was offered to three partner institutions. We are not a standalone school. We are part of the University System Office of Georgia and we work with the University System Schools and the technical colleges. We had three initial schools where we were offering our courses to train folks and from that time in 2015 which seems to be a pivotal year in terms of the growth of productions coming here. We've grown to 29 partner institutions in the state. So you can take Georgia Film Academy courses as part of a four-year degree at one of our four-year institution partners as part of a two-year degree at a technical college if that's what you're interested in. Or if you just want to go to work, you can take the Georgia Film Academy classes through continuing education. So it's kind of creating curriculum and opportunities for everybody everywhere in Georgia. And even though we started out in the primarily in the, excuse me Atlanta area, we now have teaching hubs from Rome, Georgia, all the way down to Albany. Like I said, most of those university systems that are coming on board are growing in terms of participation, especially in the technical college world. And the industry itself is building up infrastructure in more of the rural areas. So we've now partnered with Valdosta, talking to people in Albany. We have people in Northern Georgia. We have curriculum and courses in Augusta and Savannah, which is a very big market in three or four colleges now offer the Georgia Film Academy classes. So I like to tell a little anecdote about a student who came from a really rural place in Southern Georgia who took a Georgia Film Academy class. And after you successfully complete the first required courses, you can apply to get into an internship. That's what I'm in charge of. And if you are selected, then we will put you on a film or on a TV show or in a post-production house to get your hands on training. That's how many many students get jobs in the industry. So she was selected to do an internship. She got chosen to be in the costume department on Stranger Things. And she called me up and she was in tears and she said, I don't know anybody in the movie business. Nobody in my family knows anybody. I would never, never, never have had an opportunity like this. And she got hired onto that show. So that's a similar kind of trajectory for those who don't necessarily have an entrepreneurial spirit to start a business, but have a desire to work in this industry, which I said, which was previously mentioned that an average salary can be $85,000 a year. So if you're working at a sandwich shop in rural Georgia and you get an opportunity to go and train on a set, this is a really great trajectory for you. So that's kind of where we started and where we are now. You know, Katie, I was on a panel part of a panel discussion in New York just a few months ago. And one of the staffers, there was about workforce development. Just out of the blue said, if you want to look at best practices for workforce development, look to the state of Georgia and the Georgia Film Academy. And I thought, wow, I don't think this person knew on the panel that I was from Georgia, and I'm in Georgia. And the takeaway was though that it's not a degree program. Literally, anybody, any age can come from any industry, go through your certificate training program and be on a set. And that's highly unusual. And you all have been extremely successful. Thank you. Yeah. And the other thing is we, I get phone calls all the time, get phone calls from North Carolina. I get phone calls from New Mexico, from Oklahoma and other places that are putting incentives into their state. So yes, it's definitely, I think, a program that many people want to emulate because of our success. Thank you. Ms. Do you have a unique perspective? And it's one that I've heard in a number of our communities is sort of the impact of our industry on your community. So would you tell us a little bit about Cherokee County and what has happened? Sure. Thank you. Well, we represent the Cherokee Office of Economic Development. And that's two economic development authorities and a 501C3 public-private partnership that we started in 2018. So in addition to what your traditional economic development offices do with recruiting industry and helping industry expand, when our 501C3 started, we were able to spend a lot more time building our film ecosystem and workforce development initiatives as well as entrepreneurship initiatives. And so we became the liaison with the Georgia Film Office back in 2011. And he's Tippins and RVP were the ones that were working with Scouts and trying to get films to come to our area. And what we found was that we didn't have the time to do it. We were going to commit. We really needed to have someone that was doing this every day. So Molly Mercer, our film project manager's back in the corner over there. And she's been with us for about six years and has really been instrumental in increasing the films in our area. Over the last ten years we've had 337 film projects. We do not have any studios in Cherokee. We wish that we did. But we had over 700 locations in those films. And so that has definitely had impact. And I really wanted to tell you a story about how many of y'all know where Ball Ground is. Yay, not more of you have been to Trilleth than you've been to Ball Ground. I'm from an incorporated ball ground. I'm not even making a city limits. But I'm sure that a lot of you saw the movie American made with Tom Cruise. And Ball Ground, the downtown area of Ball Ground was Mina Arkansas in that movie. And those of you that have known Ball Ground for a long time know that we had one landowner that occupied the majority of Main Street, the Rockman. And he put tons of rocks and marble and stored it all on the street in the buildings. And I think we had at the time that we were scouting for American made, we had 12 businesses on Main Street. And because they selected Ball Ground to be Mina Arkansas, it sparked all this. Clean up in the area. And so all of a sudden we didn't have rocks everywhere. It brought a spirit to the town. They started making t-shirts to say Ball Ground rocks. It brought this sense of pride to the town. And there was actually an AJC article that said that American made brought this little town to life. And it really did. So they had been working on their downtown, but they were stuck, the city officials there. And so this cleanup and making these buildings available and just the energy that the film provided to the town sparked a redevelopment there. They're now 26 businesses along that Main Street. A few other little stats. The population was about 1500 at that time. And the labor force was 842. Now the population is 3,089 and the labor force is 1,827. And so there's been great population growth. There's been great business growth. And so it wasn't just about the $400,000 plus dollars that were spent in the city of Ball Ground when the filming was happening. It's really what the long-term effect of that being the spark or the shot in the arm that Ball Ground needed to really start their redevelopment. So for that, I'm very thankful. And as we represent the whole Cherokee County community, the five cities, we have four cities that are on the interstate and one that is not. And that city also does not have sewer. I will say, Molly said this, film does not discriminate against places or people or infrastructure. And so a lot of our rural areas of the county have had film production, which has brought economic development to those areas. And so for us, it helps us serve our whole community where I can't put an industry or corporation of 200,000 square feet in Alaska, Georgia. We can certainly bring film production there and that has great impact. So another little thing that we do to support the, I mentioned workforce development and we try in every vertical of economic development in Cherokee, we try to make sure that we are spilling that workforce development thread through there. And so when we hired Molly, I said, we're going to have a film summit and she goes, what does that mean? I don't know, you figure it out. And so she did. And Molly's, her background is in theater and she was a drama teacher. And so she really put this great workforce development spin on it. So we have a student film summit where we bring in all six high schools. She works, she meets regularly with the audio visual and film teachers at all the schools. And so we bring the students in during the day and we have professionals in the industry coming and speak to them. Kate has been there, I think, three different times. And we're promoting the colleges in the area that have film programs and also the Georgia Film Academy. And then in the evening, we have a professional film summit. So we've had over 900 attendees that are for professional summit and about 500 students and teachers at our student film summit. So the connections that are made there, similar to what Kate was talking about, being able to get internships for these students so they can get real world experience in film. And then also connecting our residents to the industry and that want to work in the film industry, but then also those residents that want to have their locations as a potential filming location. We appreciate our state and what you all have done to make us a great state. I didn't realize the last part about the film program. That's amazing. It speaks to what we're focused on this ability of growing Georgia, really, Georgia's next generation of storytellers. Yes. Tyler Perry, a fabulous storyteller, not our only Georgia storyteller, right? We got to, who are the next generation of storytellers and what you all are doing in education, what we're doing at the community level to embrace development of young talent is what's going to enable us to grow this industry related to IP, which is a much higher return on investment for our tax coffers than the simple facilities and infrastructure, which is doing a great job right now, but it's really setting the platform for the future growth. So thank you so much. I'd like to take a minute, Mr. Chairman, to open up the questions. Yeah, I haven't been notified of any questions from anybody. Does anybody jump in their dark red? You had a question? You need to. So without the film industry to nurture your businesses, do you see any other? Apparatists that might have been able to fuel your passion and your dreams in terms of getting your businesses off the ground? Well, I'll just say as an observer, I've been in this film, film industry, 107 years. I'm a boy from Texas and I left Texas to go be a storyteller. And that was happening a lot here in Georgia. And as you all, many of you know, I'm an educator too. It was a dean of a number of the film schools. And I never recommended Georgia for talent to go to ever that has changed. In the last five years, it's now the top place, not just because I'm here, by the way, but it's a very different opportunity environment than LA in New York. And so we can keep our young talent focused. Keep them here. When I first came to Fayette County, the number one concern was losing the 20 something year old. We have a good public education system, but they're leaving our town and our community. We've been able to reverse that having 20 something year olds moving to Fayetteville, right? Because of the studios and this is happening in these communities where young people have an opportunity. So unlike me, I had to leave my state. And I don't want to see Georgians doing that anymore. The reason the UTA, I'm sure everybody knows there's three top agencies, talent agencies in the movie business, one of them United Talent Agency, just open offices this year here in Atlanta. You know why they're going to tap into story Georgia tellers. I mean, Georgia storytellers, that's all they, that's what they're focused on. It's tapping into Georgia talent. And they can do that because of this foundation that has been laid by this smart tax policy and all the investment that these stakeholders have made in our community. My take on this is that, you know, as an entrepreneur, you want business, right? What this has allowed us to do is you took, we were able to take a dry cleaning operation that was in a small town. Where in Morgan County, everybody leaves, right? We're waiting to get out of high school to leave, leave small town. And, and it's like, how do we keep small town growing? And that's another story that you had, right? And, and obviously Atlanta, Coventon, Morgan County and Coventon, Morgan County has been heavily benefited from the film production, especially. On the east side of one thing that this film production has done for us is it's escalated, right? When you're doing 100,000 a year in dry cleaning operation and then immediately you're doing a million dollar a year, right? And that's the difference with my transportation. How does it benefit Morgan County? Well, it benefits Morgan County because we're, we're doing this tremendous amount of revenue in Atlanta and we're bringing all the revenue back to Morgan County. And it's not costing our county anything. It's not costing your infrastructure or any of those things. If we didn't have this tax in seven place and if Georgia was not as strong as it is today, I wouldn't be able to sit here and say, we are probably the largest transportation company in North America. Apple plus, sign us on. We're trying so hard for studios to sign us on. But as far as the production company go, Apple plus sign a company in Georgia. And what it allowed us to do is our hard work. Bring talent together and we innovated technology, you know, to grow where these other states have had film for 30 years. So it's hard to take a company that's been in business for 30 years and change overnight because of technology has changed. For me, being a new company since 2015, we're able to adapt to that and now we're able to bring better product that other competition that are in California, New York, and Pennsylvania does not have and we're able to do that because we are a new company, but because of the business and the flow that we have had in rapid growth of production, we have enabled to buy 150 trucks, 200 trucks a year. And we're continuing doing that because we see the growth of film in Georgia. I was just going to say, you know, for for ball ground, I think that we would have gotten there eventually, but because of American made it, it was something that had to be done on a time frame. And it forced all of that, that cleanup that happened there. So Molly and I were just talking about this on our two plus hour right over here this morning. That it would it probably would have happened eventually, but it surely wouldn't have happened as quickly as it did as far as the redevelopment of the downtown. Another thing that I failed to mention when I was speaking earlier, during COVID, we were trying to figure out what can we do to support our local economy and Molly had worked on this 20 film, a fan favorite films and had we had posted that online. And it got a lot of traction. And so we said, you know, being the middle age women that we are like, can we we should make that into an app. It was Molly's idea not mine. She's like 10 days older than me so she's not elder. But we we started working on that and with a with a local company, Black Airplane, you know, Michael Caldwell, that's his company in downtown Woodstock. But we developed a film and Cherokee app. And if you know, because we don't have studios, but we have had so many films in Cherokee, we were we wanted to encourage not only our residents to get out and understand what had happened, you know, the different places that been been filmed in Cherokee. But also we felt like that would be a great film tourism application. And so that has been very successful for us to it's one three different awards and, you know, just being able to impact tourism in our area has has also been very beneficial. And so we've been able to film in Cherokee. I'll download it. I expect to see a boost later today and our interactions. And Molly just updated it with with some new things that have filmed in the last few years. But it's really interesting to see how many different ways that that film can impact economic development, not just in our community that across the state. And I think this has just come up in this me. Just right. No, I, you know, a lot of times at the tech college here, they talk about job placement and, you know, within their, you know, program a study, so to speak. Do you all have numbers like that or data that would, you know, I'm asked this a lot clearly. It's, it's most of the data with regard to film industry jobs in terms of production is anecdotal because those are not, you're not getting hired full time at a corporation. You work on a production and then you don't work on a production and you work on a production and you don't work. So anecdotally, I can say that our graduates who've gone through the training, we have around a 65 70% getting hired full time on to a show after they finished their certification. I wish there was a way that we could quantify that more for people who ask, I haven't been able to figure that out yet. It would be a different thing if we worked in an environment where Warner Brothers and Universal had corporate headquarters here and people could go those tracks. But with regard to working in production, I don't have hard numbers, just anecdotal numbers. I'm not, I'm not seeing any other questions. Frank, I will say if there's no objection chairman Huffsteadler and I, we had one gentleman that had asked to testify that, you know, I think you'll probably know during this second hour after lunch, but we've what we might let him go ahead. Casey has a question. We'll get. I have a quick question. Can you guys hear me from police? We can hear you and see you there. Yeah. All right. Well, this is real quick. Frank, I really appreciate your conversation piece on the, on trying to really take on the whole ecosystem of film and knowing that to me, the profitability for the state of Georgia is going to be on that frontside piece and also possibly on the back end piece with distribution. And so my question you would be, do you, do you foresee an opportunity if we opened up distribution as a right down utilizing the credit that we could pull some of that distribution from other states so that we could get the actual tax revenue off the profits on film. Yes, sir, it's a great question. Part of the equation is distribution, but it really begins with the creation of the IP itself, who is the writer and how's that IP created funded owned and exploited through distribution. So I think opening where there might be a benefit is allowing productions to take some credit on the front side for the writing of the IP. And because if writer, writer rooms move here, you know how many writers rooms are here now, none, you know how many should be here at least a third of them, right. So we were creating that IP, I think it's going to be the late Tom from the Georgia Chamber on cutting him. Thank you. Who had all this data, he passed as I think everybody knows on the value to the tax base for the IP created in music business. And for us to be able to leverage the value of the IP created in the movie business by actually benefiting from the ownership of the IP and exploitation of the IP will be significantly more. So from police, I would say I agree with your premise that we've got to incentivize both the front end and the back end. So thanks Casey. Thank you Frank. Did we have anybody else sign up? Wanted to speak besides Mr. Howell? Just yes or no? Okay. All right. Well, we will break then. Thank our panelists. Thank you Frank. Thank you watch and thank you so much. We'll grab lunch and we'll come back in here and hear from a couple more folks that want to speak. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you other folks we would like to be heard as I mentioned earlier we had a bunch of testimony submitted via email but you know we have a couple more people here in person and who's going to lead us off as mr. Hilton Howe with the great television owns assembly studios and sir we appreciate you making the trip over and look forward to hearing what you have to say. Hello everyone as was mentioned my name is Hilton Howe and I'm chairman CEO of great television but I also have the privilege of being the founder and chairman of assembly studios and I look forward to telling you a little bit about this because it's very important to us and it's really an issue of great passion for me because I believe in this film and television production business in Georgia and it's quite remarkable. First I'd really like to begin I don't have prepared remarks for you I've got a few notes here but I want to start by saying thank you to each and every one of you there is nothing more that makes me proud in watching the public leadership of the state of Georgia active stewards of our taxpayers funds and I really appreciate your time not only your service and public life but your service on this committee today. I will tell you also this is an issue of great pride for me to be able to speak to you today because this is an issue of great import for our state and I want to tell you in my estimation there have been two and only two undeluted triumphs that have been created legislatively in the state of Georgia during my time here. The first is the hope scholarship. The next is the tax film incentive credit. Undeluted triumphs across the board for the young students that get them to get them education not only at the University System of Georgia but here in the technical schools of Georgia and then with regard to the jobs that are truly being created in the film industry across the board. So it is a privilege for me to be here today. As CEO of Great Television I want to tell you just a little bit about the company because we're really kind of quiet but where is Georgia a company is you can get. Gray was founded in 1891 in January of that year to publish the Albany Herald newspaper. It eventually became known as Gray because after the end of the second war James H Gray who ran for governor here was the mayor of all many for years. I bought the newspaper renamed it Gray Communications Systems and then about 30 years ago we bought control about the Gray family out. At the time it was on the pink sheets and now we've moved it to the New York Stock Exchange where it's been for the past 30 years and we have grown from one TV station that the ALB in Albany Georgia to where we are now in 114 markets across the United States. We are the second largest broadcaster in the country but most importantly we have focused in our M&A efforts on buying the highest quality assets we can get our hands on and in broadcast television what that means is the highest quality news producing stations that we are out there. Another point of pride that I want you all to know is that we are in every single market in the great peach state of Georgia. This is my home state I'm a Georgia by choice because I was born and raised in Texas and I'm awfully proud of Texas but I'm even more proud to live here in this great state. There is so many assets that the state of Georgia has it's remarkable and Gray is proud to now be in every single market in the state of Georgia from Atlanta to Augusta to Savannah to Albany to Columbus and most recently in Macon Georgia and I want to just point out a few folks that are here with our company for you first Justin Campbell our vice president of studio productions at assembly in third-real studio also Toby and Kellan Carr who I know need no introduction to this group and then last our in a redoutable senior political reporter Doug Reardon here in the back and those are our cameras for Atlanta news first and so some of this may be carried not just in the Atlanta market but throughout the markets of Georgia. Two things that we have done Georgia-wise within Gray that I think you should know if you haven't been paying attention first we took Telamundo we bought Telamundo Atlanta and we have taken it now statewide so not only have we taken Telamundo and Spanish language communications and local news and regional news statewide in Georgia we've expanded it throughout the South so currently live we have Telamundo live statewide Georgia Tennessee South Carolina and Alabama very proud of that last week we launched the Peachtree Sports Network Georgia only it will launch the 6th of October in Atlanta and then each market will follow up therefore or thereafter carrying live sports from throughout the state and now obviously I'm gonna be shooting for the braves on the hawks I just want you to know all right now whether or not I get them I don't know but in the meantime there's so many sports things that mean so much to viewers in this state and we're very excited because we're one of the few station groups that can cover an entire state and bring all of that to our viewers you know as I said the Georgia film tax credit is an undiluted triumph you know when you have all the hands in your favor you double down you don't fold that's a situation that this committee and the general assembly faces they're looking at this every state in the United States is gunning for Georgia I'm looking up to know this because our business is in all every state in the United States except for Washington Montana and California they all want to be Georgia they don't know what the great mix of the magic is that that has been created here but let me tell you what the mix of that magic is obviously during the great recession in 2008 nothing would have happened without the Georgia film and tax incentive credit all right but beyond that it's a high and I believe a governor pruning beyond that you guys created the George of film Academy and I see my friend Jeff Steppelkov over here Jeff congratulations because over the last what I think of these two generations we have young men and women who have grown up within the business they start out either at a technical school like right here in Athens or at the university system from their school of origin then they go to the Georgia film Academy which here to floor has been resident at Trilleth the Kathy families operation in Fayetteville but they will be coming to assembly as soon as we are fully operational and have trained up two generations of local Georgia boys and girls to create the local based crews that actually support the films that are brought there there's a conard out there that Georgia's bringing in a bunch of Californians you know in 2007 that might have been a true statement all right because there wasn't that that crew base that was domestic here but because of what Jeff's pioneering efforts we now have all those folks that are local Georgians that are graduates of our public university systems and our public tech school systems and I think all of you should really be proud about that and it's one of the reasons I say this is an undiluted triumph one of the things about the jobs let me just tell you it's every kind of job and more importantly it's every kind of job that you can outsource know amount artificial intelligence or Japanese robotic technology is going to replace the individuals that are out there because in the film business you have painters you have architects do you have carpenters you have electricians can't be outsource robots aren't going to paint a set they're not going to build a set but more importantly we're talking about technical school jobs blue collar jobs but guess what they get paid white collar wages and that is a big deal there is nothing more importance in life in my judgment than a good job in a solid career and that spot this film tax credit is creating within the state of Georgia now let me tell you about assembly at Lantern currently we have 1200 people working seven days a week to get this thing finished I know a lot of you folks have been invited to our October 21st Gala I hope you attend it's going to be a historical sort of event and we've got a heck of a lineup and but beyond that we will be launching 4,000 jobs as permanent jobs within the actual facilities of assembly within their gates but the numbers going to probably double that because those are just the permanent jobs that are going to be staffing assembly itself then you have all of the other jobs that come with each of the individual productions and while I kind of ask permission from NBC Universal our primary tenant to tell you what's coming next year I haven't gotten it yet so I'm not going to tell you but we have three major blockbusters that are from that film television family that will be produced and shot here in Georgia at assembly studios and right off the bat that's a billion dollars of production value in 2024 so this date hit 4.4 billion two years ago this past year dropped a little bit to 4.1 billion as before assembly came online I'm going to bring it at least to be in an I think and I remember I'm an optimist here I think it's going to be in for the first year of operations because those three blockbusters that I know are coming don't include what Justin here is going to be doing with our studios and don't include the television productions that will be coming to assembly and the third rail studios which is an existing studio complex that will be acquired at the same time we bought the property for the General Motors assembly plant so you know as I mentioned to you you guys are winning you're winning when you're winning in my view you double down that's how you win more in this life you don't fold your cards every single state because of the exposure that I have and you can read it in the press everybody wants to be Georgia all right and a film attacks credit is an inherent part the any part of the film business in this country any competition that each of you or the this date has is going to have the film attacks credit the film business really got started in New York and California they still have them all right and they're out there and they're producing but Georgia is growing like a weed if things stay stable if we don't make bad headlines if people have faith and confidence that this is going to be here and then they will invest like I have we've spent $400 million and Gray has received no public funds did not ask for it has not received it and Gray is not a recipient of any tax incentive funds our customers however do individually based on their productions but you got a half a billion dollar property out there in Dorival Georgia on the old General Motors plant that set dormant four years and if you go back and look at the time that we did this you can't put you know malls there there's a question about the existence of malls in the future because of people working for home I mean offices is it you can put offices on that property I don't know that you are and so really the film production facility perfect location and I will tell you and I'm not wise enough to know if this is true or not but I've heard it from enough that I believe that it's accurate we set out to do something that set Georgia apart every single human being that has worked on this whether it's the workers to the creative people the the architects the designers the commodity providers steel and concrete every single one of them 100% Georgia based you know there's a story I want to share with you a friend of mine has a mobile digital deal and his largest client was AT&T and the management of that account creatively got shifted to an individual that live in LA and they fired him in Atlanta because they thought the only creative thing that comes out anything's in LA we set out to prove them wrong and to show off what Georgia has and I hope all of you come and visit and those of you who are invited to the brand opening come on out have a good time with us it's going to be a history-making affair but it was very important for us to show those individuals what Georgia can do and they are blown away within the NBC Universal process when we began they were adding to their studios in London and in LA and they're still doing it and in less than two years gray and the 1200 people that are out there working right now in the Gibson Company our lead development partner in less than two years we've built a million three hundred fifty thousand square feet and it's the best in the business we've had ten different people every CEO there were a major phone producer in the in the country who have actually seen everything in India everything in London and they tell us this is the finest film producing you know facility not just in Georgia not just in the United States but the finest in the world and I think when you guys get a chance to see it go online look at assembly it land on Instagram go watch what we've done and I think you're extremely proud of what we've been able to put together one of the things that I really do want to reinforce is that tourism and reputation is such an important issue and I know that people want to push the investment this date is made into a return on investment and want to get firm dollars and all the rest of that you know I grew up I grew up in Texas when I was a young boy was born in 62 and by the time I was kind of paying attention what was going on in life Dallas was known as the place that John Kennedy got shot and all of sudden the TV show Dallas came around and everybody forgot about John Kennedy and where he got shot you ask most of the young kids today I doubt they know where he got shot they just know he did and that has changed the reputation of Dallas and once it did that city has taken off blown out the doors now Georgia the reputation that this date has accrued since this began in 2008 I think he's sterling people look at Georgia and they all wonder from the outside how did Georgia do this like what the hell's going on I mean like really like who is Georgia like and who do they think they are who is this upstart southern state that nobody thought would even be interested in the creative arts and yet you guys did it your predecessors did it and you did it brilliantly and I think that the public leadership in Georgia should be thanked and congratulated for what has happened because you have put us in a cat bird seat across the country and that's why Gray has invested half a billion dollars in building assembly studios it's why we bought third rail and we also inherited Atlanta film studios and Pauling County and it's a solid business the biggest thing that is holding us back right now is the questions that other businessmen and women have about is this going to be cut back is it going to be eliminated is going to be and so there's I can't tell you I can't use their names here in this format form but so many people that want to bring the national headquarters for post-production digital production the writing of scripts you know across the they want to bring it to Georgia they want to make this the headquarters and that to me is really exciting I have personally met with a lot of these folks and you'd be really impressed and you'd be really proud to have them here is that being their North American headquarters but you know what they want to know

happening here. Businesses need consistency. They need to have confidence. And I will tell you what has happened in Georgia here to whore has been literally bragging. It's literally been bringing. One thing that I think that we have provided all of you is a digital sort of description of what we did with Hwy Georgia. It's a two years ago when we got into the Atlanta market and when we started buying into studio properties and then creating studio properties, I actually let our investigative TV crews out loose because a lot of people in Georgia, you know, they knew that movies were being shot in Georgia, but they didn't really know where. And if it didn't interfere with their lifestyles, if it wasn't in a house down the street from them, if it weren't, you know, they just really didn't know. And so the story hadn't been told. And we've done in the neighborhood of 15 to 20 of these Hwy Georgia things. And they're not focused on what great television and our studio operations have done. They're focused on the whole industry from the film academy to every other studio in the space to what it's done for other businesses and other local markets. And it's stunning. If you haven't watched them, they're narrated and put together by Monica Pearson, who I'm sure all of you know. And they really tell a story that had not yet been told in Georgia. And so I encourage you to take a moment to look through them. We aired a 30 minute public service announcements in all markets in Georgia, this late July. And this fall, we are running PSAs throughout the course of the fall season, just so that the people out there know really what's going on with the film business. Because at the end of the day, as a TV broadcaster, one of the things I'm really proud of is, you know, we get to tell a story. We get to tell about what's going on with people. And that opens up light on areas that people just might not know. And so I think it's a brilliant, brilliant campaign. I will tell you the future of this business is in your hands. And I have a great deal of confidence that each of you will use your individual judgment to make a decision about it. But I encourage you to reward success. At the end of the day, you want to feed your winners, you want to cut your losers. Sometimes in business, they tell you, oh, well, this is a cash cow now. You take the money from the cash cow and give it to the losers. Huge mistake in business. Huge mistake. You feed your winners because they keep going. If you starve your winners, then they stop winning. It's just that simple. And so a reaffirmation of Georgia's commitment to the to the industry, I think, is hugely important. And I think it's up to you guys and your judicious wisdom to make a decision how valuable that is. I'm going to tell you something about my personal life. And this is me as a Georgia not as CEO of a greater founder of assembly studios. But I watched Georgia lose the banking industry to Charlotte. And my family was involved in the banking business. My father-in-law was Jay McRovinson. Some of you may have known him. One of the requirements, because he uncontrolled a first national Atlanta, which became known as first Atlanta. And they eventually merged with Wacovia. But one of the requirements that Mac had was that the headquarters was in Atlanta. And they negotiated, negotiated, negotiated. Eventually, they couldn't say they did dual headquarters at Atlanta and Winston-Salem. And then candidly, Humacall and North Carolina national bank to go back in history. Struck rules in the state of North Carolina that attracted every major banking system to Charlotte. And at that time, Charlotte was not even a remote rival for the city of Atlanta. And Atlanta was the southern headquarters of finances and banking. And banking generates so many jobs on the outside of it. I mean, they're just from law firms to just everything. You know, like Jesse said, James says, why is that? Why is that? What's because that's where the money is, right? So that's what happened. And we lost that Atlanta should be the financial capital of the South. And what's ending up happening is Charlotte got turned into the financial capital of the United States. Now, that's an achievement in North Carolina. North Carolina tried the film tax credits. Then they backed off. And right now, there's a bunch of studios, and I've got a TV station in Wilmington, that are all covered up in cobwebs. And as a Georgian who has one involvement or another in all of these things, don't lose what you got. Don't lose what you got. You're winning. And if you keep steady, there's going to be such a strong sucking sound out of other states that it's going to boggle your mind. And the prosperity of this state is going to go through the ceiling. And it's again, all about the judgment that is resident underneath the golden dome and in the general assembly. So with that, I will tell you, LA film came out yesterday. And I may have touched on this, but I want to mention it again. And they talked about how essentially their production was sort of flat. And we are up 42% during COVID years. Now, I'm going to give some credit to Governor Kim opening up this date of Georgia. But there's a lot of COVID restrictions that we had. But I worry about a cap because while other states have it, those states are largely California and New York, which have exceptionally mature businesses, I mean, started businesses. We are in the growth phase. And I know there's a lot of folks here that look at said, oh, geez, you know, we now have more square footage of production space than anybody besides California. We now have exceeded a New York. And that doesn't include assembly and our square footage. So we will substantially surpass New York. And I don't know what that will do vis-a-vis California. But if in 2021, 222, we did 58 and they did 226. We start looking at a cap. Maybe when it's at 200 some out up there. With that, let me bring my comments to a close and then open my self up for any questions that you guys may have. Questions for Mr. Hill. Thank you very much. Thank you. We do have a couple questions. Well, thank you guys. Senator Red. So basically, people like yourself, when you come to Georgia, the initial investment comes privately from you to set up. Yes, there's actually assembly, it's about a half a billion dollar investment and we pay for it in cash and we have no debt on it. So it was paid out of the free cash flow of great television. So I know I don't have that kind of money. Well, I don't either. That's my company's money. So I do have a pretty good chair in the company. But to leave California to come away to Georgia and then invest in infrastructure, that says a lot in terms of what we have to offer. Well, please understand, I'm a Georgian. I live here in Atlanta, Georgia and have since 1991. And so and I'm not going anywhere. I've raised all four of my children here. I'm a Georgian by choice. I love this state and I love the city I live in and I love all the areas, you know, that have been out there because I've been lucky. I've got businesses spread all over the state of Georgia and and this is one of the most unique and special beautiful places on the planet earth. And I think it's time for us to show Georgia off. I mean, I really do. It has everything mountains, coastlines, plains, trees, you know, the west, Ella, it's brown. All right. Georgia's green. You know, it's beautifully green. There's so much to the state of Georgia. And one of the things I saw. Well, the facades, let me tell you guys a little bit of facades. We want people to film Georgia. We want them to film our cities. We want them in Columbus. We want them in Covington. We want them in Savannah. We want them in Atlanta. We want them in Athens. We want them in the small hamlets. We want them in the mountains. But you know, there's certain architectural things that we just don't really have. And Lee Thomas, are you here at the Thara Salyou? She was. It was that group that advised us on this because based on requests that they had, there were four locales that Georgia and Atlanta and other states or other cities within our state didn't have. And so the front facades that you can see online right now represent New Orleans. It represents Brownstones from New York, Upper East Side, Upper West Side, Brooklyn. It represents sort of a pan-European vision, houseman roof lines and all the rest. And then the final is we call it Tribeca colloquially. But it's Tribeca because it's industrial centered. It's red brick. It's different forms of bricks. We've got exposed fire escapes. We're going to industrial look, thank, and NBC broadcast a Chicago fire. You know, different things that you're out doing and filming. And so what we're hoping to do there is allow everyone to produce on a budget and and then do it all here in Georgia. So based upon the guidance from, you know, the Georgia film office, those are the facades that we put up there. And that's why we did it. And so, and they're beautiful. And I will tell you, unlike the cardboard and plywood that the, you know, back plots have an LA iris is like limestone, Georgia, limestone, Georgia granite, Georgia bricks, Georgia would all the way across and it is extraordinary. You should see it at night. You can now see it from 285 when the sun sets all the lights are on it now. It's just beautiful. Anything else? Thank you, Mr. Howell. Thank you so much for your testimony. Thank you for choosing Georgia. Thank you. I appreciate you being here today. Mr. Brennan, Differ, are you ready? I know you said you you'd like a couple of minutes. Creative media industry institute with Georgia State University. Is that right? That is correct. Thank you, sir. It's great to follow, Mr. Howell. Am I the last speaker? Do we have others? We have two other. Oh, good. A couple other signs of speak here. Fantastic. Just one to read a written response that I have for you this afternoon. I'm good afternoon. Members of the congressional tax panel and a special thanks to Senator Hofstettler and the committee for granting us the opportunity to speak today. My name is Brennan Diker and I serve as the executive director of the Creative Media Industries Institute at Georgia State University. I'll be providing a concise overview of CMII digital report and its significant findings. To set the context, I'd like to start with an introduction to CMII. Our institute was established in 2017 with fewer than 150 students and today we proudly serve nearly 900 students across various degree programs including game design, game development and media entrepreneurship. We also established an MFA last year that provides virtual production and VFX. What makes CMI unique is our commitment to diversity with over 50% women and over 60% diversity within our student body. And I heard earlier today favorite movies. So I just have to say that I'm going off script a bit. I would say the Godfather and Apocalypse Now. And if there's a theme to this, it's because we had Francis Ford Coppola come work with our students a couple weeks ago at CMII on his movie. Our students were credited. It was a project that was revenue generation to CMII so we could put money back into the school. That's just one of many projects that we do at CMII. And that particular one was just incredible to have a director like Francis Ford Coppola come and work directly in the studio with the students and the faculty. So the CMI Digital Report is the result of a collaborative effort that began in 2019. It was produced by the creative media industries Institute and partnership with Georgia State, Entertainment Coalition and the Georgia Partnership Production, production partnerships. Excuse me. Originally our overall goal was to provide a comprehensive analysis of the benefits of Georgia's entertainment industries. Georgia's creative economy is booming with new sound stages like Athena Studios here in Athens and many others opening across the street. The industry's experience remarkable growth starting in 2007 with 125 million in direct spend and now exceeding $4 billion in 2022 and 2023. So $8 billion altogether in direct spend. The CMI Digital Report aims to highlight the ripple effect of the creative economy showcase how it creates jobs and opportunities not only in production but throughout the broader creative sector. We also demonstrate the substantial growth in investment in Georgia's digital content creation hub and suggest ways to better quantify the contributions including workforce diversity. An essential driver for this study was the new auto requirements established in 2021. And I believe this is under as Senate bill number six. Is that right David? David is the author of the Digital Report. He's a professor at CMI. I'm a professor David Cheshire. These requirements go beyond traditional economic analysis and include a focus on non-monitorial public benefits. Our aim is to shed light on these non-monitorial public benefits and encourage meaningful discussion about their potential impacts in encompassing areas such as economic growth, job creation, increased tourism, infrastructure development, fostering a creative culture, education of course, community development and cultural exchange. In our report, we emphasize several key areas. First, we underscore how the creative industry is contributing to both urban and rural economic development. Second, we highlight the critical role of educational institutions like UGA, GSU and Georgia Film Academy in retaining the talent within the state. And that's one of the most important things to remember here is that 15 years ago, graduates of these universities didn't have the opportunity to join film and television gaming e-sports because it wasn't here. Film and the film incentive really provided that. And so now they can stay in Georgia and contribute to the workforce and that's so important to remember. As of now, Georgia ranks among the top three production centers alongside California New York. The tax incentive initiates significant growth in Georgia's film industry attracting various companies, including those in virtual and post production, visual effects, animation, gaming, and e-sports. Georgia's creative work is expanding far beyond Atlanta as you've heard today, with notable growth in cities like Athens, Savannah, Columbus, and regions throughout the state, including Northeast and Southeast Georgia. In 2008 to 2019, Georgia experienced a 210% growth in its creative sector statewide. This expansion spans film, television, music, virtual and post production, animation, gaming, and e-sports marking significant economic growth. The film industry in Georgia has sparked substantial infrastructional investments. As we heard from Mr. Hal, in the last two years alone, major studio expansion have added nearly 5 million square feet of production space. These expansions reflect investor confidence in the future of Georgia's entertainment industry. Between 2012 and 2022, these projects generated 1.3 billion in direct capital development, with another 1.27 billion projected in 2023 to 2025. Significant numbers there. Georgia's entertainment sector demonstrated a remarkable resilience during COVID-19 pandemic. The industry's swift response and innovative safety protocols through that was through the GFA allowed it to reopen quickly. Notably, Tyler Perry played a pivotal role in creating a working production during the pandemic. But production came back because Georgia had a plan and we worked with industry and worked with the state together to make that happen. Our report also highlights the diversity within Georgia's creative workforce, with representation at all levels of the entertainment and production industry. This diversity is a testament to the impact of content creators like Tyler Perry and Will Packer. The growth in studio development, post-production and startups and sectors like gaming, eSports reflect the thriving craving to industry in Georgia. Key players like you heard of today, Trilleth, Tyler Perry studios, Sinelese, and local startups like Munchine Post and Skullshot contribute these vibrant ecosystems. In conclusion, the Film and Taxi 7 has proven to be a paramount importance. It supports thousands of jobs across various industries in Georgia and brings about essential non-monitory public benefits, maintaining a stable and enticing tax credit is crucial for Georgia to retain its global status as an entertainment production leader. I want to express my gratitude for the opportunity to share these insights with the committee and I thank you for your time. Thank you, Mr. Dicker. I'm going to ask anybody if they have questions to catch you offline. We've got a hard stop at one o'clock. Two more people that have signed up. Of course, and I'd just like to say I hope you guys get a chance to read the report. All of you here and all of you in the room. Thank you so much. Thank you for being here. Thank you for coming. Our Hannah and Philip here, y'all together, or separate? Oh, hey Hannah. I need to do this to you. We've got kind of a hard stop at one, but we'd love to hear what you have to say. I've wrote it down, so I'll go around my topics. Hi, I'm Hannah McGuggen. I speak as both a film industry crew member and a very small, very, very small business owner. Goody lights is my company. As a born and raised small town southerner, 15 years ago I zoomed out zoomed out on Mapquests and said, oh, look, there's Atlanta. It's bigger than Charlotte. And that's as much thought as I put into moving here. I was originally working in live entertainment and theater, but in 2010 I got introduced to the film industry and I have not stopped since then. The incentives have been hugely impactful in my life and my career. I am as well as has often been referred today as a worker. I work as a lighting console programmer, which if you go to a concert and you see the lights flashing around and moving, I am the person that controls them, but I do it in the film and television world. And I work with the chief lighting technician and the director of photography to get the look of the show and all that fun stuff. I never imagined owning a small business, but thanks to the film incentives and this state, I own a business and I have, I do have my Georgia tax and sales use and my business license. This industry has given me more than just my small business. I now have medical insurance and I own a home in Decap County where I reside with my four-legged family. I ask that you consider and I ask that you consider the thousands of Georgia residents who work in the film industry. We are homeowners, we are renters, we are voters and we are spending money year-round in Georgia businesses. Then direct impact, it's huge. Ask any server and any neighborhood spot in the metro at La Area area. They are going to tell you they have been impacted by the film business. I'm sorry, I lost my place. And please consider the hundreds, if not thousands, of small businesses like myself that would also be impacted by the incentives because the incentives attract the productions here. Please consider also the hundreds of people who have moved to Georgia after bringing their experience to become a Georgia resident, settling down and finding a warm home in our PT state. Thank you for your time and as I learned to say, go dogs. Is Phillips still here? Good afternoon, I know we need to be very quick with this. So, esteemed panel and guests, thank you for being here and for your time in this matter. I am a former accountant turned film crew member. If you think changing careers going within the same industry is difficult, try going from doing audits and tax returns on a tin key to driving a 40,000 pound crane that goes 135 feet in year and being at the top of that crane. Those are just some of the things I've done as a film crew member. Economically, when I think about the impact that film in particular has had on our state, I look at typically the low, the people in the lowest economic runs of the industry, the worker beats like myself. As someone who has been in a position of management in my department of electrically lighting and seen the hours that put in and have done the time cards, I can tell you the people, the booths on the ground, some of which don't have high school diploma, excuse me, diplomas have never been in the college in many cases. The number of people making six figures in this and because of this industry is astronomical, astronomical. And if you need another gauge as to how well they're doing because of film, go to any any film site, location or studio and look at all the $40,000 plus trucks parked in the parking lot and watch the number of under 25 year olds come out at rap and getting those trucks and drive away. I'm telling you this industry as you well know is a juggernaut. Let's keep it going. And Mr. Howell in particular, sir, I've worked on a number of your productions over the years. I just want to personally thank you because you've helped put food on my family's table in this industry and please keep going what you're doing. We very much appreciate thank you panel again for being here. All right, thank you all for understanding our time constraints and I appreciate the testimony Philip and Hannah and everybody else that was here today, particular thanks to the panelists for for their investment and in time. Chairman upsteadler, do you have anything else? All right, well before we adjourn I'd just like to again invite those that would like to over to 900. I think it's a thing to drive over to Athena studios for a tour if you're interested. Next meeting is November the 8th and it will be in Debbie Columbus, George. All right, there's nothing further for the good of the order. We'll stand adjourned. Thank you.
