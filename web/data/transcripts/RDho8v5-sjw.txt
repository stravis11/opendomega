TRANSCRIPT
----------
We're going to talk about legislation
involving the legal issues Georgians
sometimes face. Joining me is Republican
Senator Ed Settzler of Aworth. He chairs
the Senate Science and Technology
Committee and his vice president of
State and Local Government Operations
and Secretary of Health and Human
Services in the Senate. He's also on
Senate Appropriations. Also here is a
member of appropriations in the House,
Democratic Representative Scott Hulkcom
of Atlanta. A few of the other
committees he serves on include Defense
and Veterans Affairs, Judiciary and
Public Safety, and Homeland Security.
Welcome back to lawmakers to both of
you. I appreciate this. Thank you.
>> Yeah. Chairman Sler, I'm going to start
with you. Let's start with your bill SB
404. It flips the traditional approach
to child custody in divorce cases. Tell
us about it.
>> You know, Don, if we're gonna if Georgia
to be the best place to live, work, and
to raise a family, we've got to make
sure that no one's left behind in that
process. We think about the the
challenges we face. You know, more than
40% of kids in Georgia are born out of
wedlock. Um, in all those cases, there's
going to be a child custody arrangement
that's put in place by our court system.
And then, of course, as you see, even
kids who are the in families where
divorce happens. What can we do to set
conditions for both parents to be
involved in those kids' lives to make a
difference in their lives? We recognize
that that both parents have an important
role in parenthood. And in Georgia, um
the average kid spends only 20% of the
time with their non-custodial parent. We
recognize the importance of having both
parents in their lives is very
important. And when this has been done
in other states from Kentucky to
Florida, even Massachusetts has done
this for years, we see domestic violence
go down and we see the outcomes for kids
be dramatically better.
>> So child the defaultest child is a joint
custody and then the judges would make
the decisions from there if they wanted
to be one parent or the other.
>> Judges will always make the decision for
what's in the best interest of the
child. But what we're doing in Senate
Bill 404 is we're simply saying that the
default would be a 50/50 sharing between
mom and dad. Um that if there's if
there's evidence that suggests one
parent shouldn't have as much time as
the other, then the judge can make that
determination exactly like they can
today. But the default the starting
point would be 5050 sharing of time. And
we've seen again we've seen in other
states that have done this a real uh
benefit for kids um a reduction in
violence and just overall better
outcomes for the family.
>> Okay. I'm going to get back with you on
that a little bit. Representative
Hulkman, you have a bill that would
allow a Georgia judge to take a second
look at certain life sentences without
parole and after 20 years, but it's kind
of narrow in that certain defined cases,
not considering murder or rape or other
violent crimes. So, talk about that a
little bit.
>> That's right. It it's something that I
think is worthy of a conversation. And
it was brought to me by Kelly Burke, who
is a former district attorney from Hston
County in the middle of our state. And
he was a very accomplished prosecutor,
but he's um very much committed to
trying to fix a case that he worked on.
And specifically, there was a young man
who committed an armed armed robbery,
very significant offense. It was at the
time that George was moving to a tough
on crime approach and he was caught in
with statutes of recidivism. His other
incidents weren't particularly severe
and grave, but because he was caught
under that statute as a recidivist, he
received life without parole. Uh the
other individual, and nobody was hurt,
there was no violence that was part of
this. Um the other individual received
10 years. So this person is now served
28 years in prison for a felony that did
not involve violence, that did not
result in a death. And the idea is to to
open this up so that an individuals can
petition the court and potentially have
their sentence relooked at. And I I
think it's important both from a
correction standpoint and from from a
morality standpoint. We know things
today that we didn't know 20 years ago
when we had the policies that he was
captured under and it preceded a lot of
the good work that the state has done
with criminal justice reform. So I
really hope we can. Right now, judges
can't revisit those cases.
>> They can't
>> not even at the 25 year mark, which is
considered life.
>> And and there's limited activity that
comes out of the board of of pardons and
paroles. And I think if you think about
the criminal justice system as a system,
it's a fair conversation to have of
whether or not we want to spend state
resources on the great cost of
incarcerating older inmates as opposed
to potentially putting more resources at
the beginning solving crime um deterring
crime. And so for those that have have
really served consequential terms of 20
years, it just gives a potential path to
have a second look at it. And certainly
this is one instance, but there are
others out there.
>> Okay. I'm going to talk to you a little
bit more too, Chairman. Settler, back to
SP 404. How would it address conflicts
in marriages that lead to divorce? Um,
domestic violence, maybe problems with
the child abuse.
>> Yeah. What we find is that when you look
at states that have done this before, we
see a decrease long-term domestic
violence of about 20%. U and during the
period in which u custody is in dispute,
we see a decrease in family violence of
about 33%. So there's a big step down.
What it does is it deescalates some of
the conflict between mom and dad because
there's they're shared time. You know,
dad's able to pick the kids up at
school. Um mom drops them off, dad picks
them up. It's it's a more harmonious
relationship with respect to managing
the kids as opposed to dad having or mom
having a just a very narrow amount of
time. So we've seen a deescalation in
violence. But again, as we said before,
Don, it doesn't change the standard.
Judges are still going to make decisions
based on what's in the best interest of
the child. It just gives the judges a
starting point of 50/50 from which they
would have to find facts and say, "But
because of this fact or this fact, we're
going to award more custody to one
parent or the other, but the starting
point is still 50/50 to again deescalate
some of that conflict. Would child
support be involved at all in terms of
determining who gives child does the
childhood support or helps one family
side of the family or the other?
>> Yeah, the the time the kid spends with
each parents can have some impact on
child support. But interestingly, what
we found is that um you know the the
custodial parents that that bear the
brunt of the cost uh in shared parenting
arrangements, we've actually seen their
careers and incomes do quite well
because they're because they're sharing
time with the kids. they're able to have
they're able to be able to pursue career
opportunities for themselves. So
long-term the financial outcome of both
parents is better. Um but it does it
does that through the parents means not
through you know a court ruling. Um it
could take one parent that maybe maybe
has another family, another marriage
that's that's having to send send money
back and forth. It just creates a lot of
conflict and the kids don't benefit from
it.
>> Yeah. But the judge in the end makes
that decision.
>> Judge makes the call.
>> Okay. We're going to get to another bill
you have. You have a bill that deals
with improving data tracking for crimes.
Tell us what that's all about.
>> I'd be happy to. We live in a big data
world. However, when it comes to the
criminal justice system, we do a
terrible job of tracking arrests,
indictments, um prosecutions, is that
there's uh a real void of information,
which is important for us to understand
how we're doing in terms of the trend
lines and solving crimes. We really give
a lot of attention rightly to murders
and we have very high clearance rates of
murders meaning that they're solved and
people are held accountable for it. But
so many crimes below that we have
clearance rates of less than 10%. Like
rape, sexual assault and a lot of
property crimes like people their
neighbors get robbed and then nothing
happens. We all know about that. So what
I want to do is really get the data out
there so we can see where the incidents
are happening and also longitudinally
how are we doing in terms of addressing
it and reducing it because we really
work in this void that's unacceptable.
>> Okay. I want to get to something real
quick with you. You you have um you want
to protect home ownership through
creating incentives for Wall Street to
sell homes to original to the original
families through single family homes. I
guess you want to do that. We don't have
a lot of time. So D, we've seen an issue
around the metro area of big corporate
interests, Wall Street interest buying
up single family homes, especially in
the lower half of the price bracket so
younger families can't find a home.
>> We're I'm going to have a bill this year
that's going to create both kind of a
carrot and a stick approach to encourage
investors to sell their homes to
first-time homeowners to get people back
into the housing business so folks can
own their own homes again, particularly
people at the the lower income levels
who want to own their first home and get
in become a first-time home buyer.
>> Now, we're going to get you back in when
you get that bill. um ready and we'll
talk more about it. I do want to get
something in real quick. You guys have
known each other for a long long time.
You were very excited that he was going
to be on with you in the uh talk talk
about what what the connection is. It's
at the infantry.
>> Senator Setsler and I served together
more than 20 years ago in the third
infantry division down at Fort Stewart.
And so we have a bond that goes beyond
politics and uh while we're in different
parties, we have a close friendship
because of that. Yeah, that it's amazing
that you guys did you stay connected all
over those years?
>> We did. We kind of reconnected through
politics, but you know, it's it's just
funny how how life kind of brings you
through the the people you run into uh
no matter where you go. It's been been
kind of fun to watch that.
>> Yeah, I bet it has been. I appreciate
that. We did put a picture up of what it
looked like for the 15th Infantry
Regiment. Thank you so much. Thank you.
Thank you for serving and in the uh
military and in the G Georgia
legislature.
