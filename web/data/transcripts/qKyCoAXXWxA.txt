TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good afternoon.
As many of you know over the past year, so we have taken a hard look at our tax credits
to ensure we are putting state in the best possible financial posture.
It is our job to ensure the state's tax structure is fair and equitable for all Georgians.
And there were no shortage of well thought out suggestions.
So after several meetings reviewing a number of audits, we've considered some recommendations
and we'll be putting them into legislation.
We appreciate the work of our respective committees
and hope to continue our joint review of tax expenditures
and an effort to best serve the citizens of our state.
We set out with a few goals in mind to focus on.
Increasing transparency and accountability,
strengthening taxpayer return on investment
and limiting the fiscal exposure for the state.
In general, we will be adding sunset provisions
to exemptions and credits under a million dollars,
shortening some of our longer carry forward items.
And Chairman Huffsteadler has measures
addressing transparency and accountability.
Additionally, we have some suggested adjustments
to three specific credits
in order to better align with our shared goals.
First, we will be suspending the tax exemption
for high-tech data centers.
Additionally, we will be raising the salary threshold
required to qualify for the exemption
to 200% of the average county wage
should it be revisited in the future.
Second, on the Affordable Housing Tax Credit,
we have added some transparency
at an uplift menu of options for entities
to receive a portion of the state credit.
And third, on the film credit,
we are adjusting the uplift menu
to include nine possible measures
of which production companies must hit four
to obtain the additional 10% credit.
We also raised the minimum investment requirement
and add assignability of credits
with regard to transferability to include
an exposure limiting provision.
We believe these measures meet an expected level
of fiscal responsibility while at the same time
preserving a very business-friendly job
creating economic environment.
Many thanks to Speaker Burns and Lieutenant Governor Jones
for their leadership and insistence
on protecting our taxpayers and our state's economy.
Now hand it over to Chairman Huffsteppler.
Thank you Chairman Blackman, as y'all know we've had a very slow and deliberate process
of evaluating these tax credits.
Just like we've had a slow and deliberate process of lowering the income tax in Georgia
with triggers and safeguards to be sure we're doing it in a responsible manner.
I got a few members that think maybe we're doing a little bit too slow, but we are being
responsible in it.
But I also want to point out, this isn't just about tax cuts, tax credits.
We've increased funding in many areas of our budget to address the growing needs of
our state.
An example I'd like to give is our teachers now have the highest average salary anywhere
in the south from Texas to Virginia.
So this is all about using the taxpayers' dollars in the most effective and efficient manner.
We also are in a competitive market with other states in our area of the country to attract
both businesses and the best and the brightest of talent.
So, George has certainly been a leader in the South,
but we can't relax and rest on our laurels, and we won't.
So, I thank Chairman Blackman for his hard work
over the last year and the issues that he talked about.
We'll go through the process of both the House and the Senate.
We appreciate the work of the House,
and we'll give it our due diligence in the Senate.
We look forward to getting their hard work to the Senate
and continuing our efforts to give our taxpayers
best bang for their hard earned tax dollars and continue to make Georgia the
envy of the South in the nation. Again I appreciate everybody's work on this
and we'll turn it over to our leader in the Senate Lieutenant Governor
Bert Jones. Thank you Chairman Hustler and thank you Chairman Blackwind. I just
want to really commend these two gentlemen for working so hard in the
off season on this initiative. You know it's always been my goal to no one
continue to lower our state income tax.
We've started that measure, started that measure
several years ago.
We're going to continue to do that.
And the only way you can do that is by assessing
the tax credits and incentives that are out there right now,
adjust some of them, eliminate others.
And that's what we're working on as two bodies.
I want to thank the speaker for allowing us the opportunity
to work together.
I've had Chairman Black in my office in Jackson, Georgia on several times during the
all season as well as Chairman Hussetler and so it just represents a good cooperation
between both chambers looking at all these incentives and really looking out for the
taxpayers of Georgia at the end of the day because that's what we're here for and we're
going to continue to do that and we're going to be very methodical and like I said,
fiscally responsible and we're going to go at the pace that we want to go and but right
now we are putting these initiatives out there and each chamber will get to work on it and
we'll see what we come out as a final product but once again I want to congratulate our two
chairmen for being able to work together and thank the speaker again for his continued
friendship and cooperation, and just look forward to continue to work on these things.
Speaker.
Thank you.
Speaker.
Speaker.
Speaker.
Speaker.
Well, y'all know how I like to start off.
It's a good day to be a Georgian, I think.
Some good announcements.
I know it's a good day to be a Georgian.
It's a good day to be a Georgia taxpayer.
We want to take care of our Georgia taxpayers and to turn our governor and myself.
and these two find chairman that are dedicated to the House and to the Senate.
Thank you for your work.
You know, we all in the General Assembly have worked really hard of the last few years
to work on the issues that make sure Georgia continues to be the number one state in the country
unrivaled in our country and our success.
And what we've been working with here is part of that success story.
You know, Governor Camp continues to champion
the economic development and he's doing a great job
of working with us and the General Assembly
to write this story.
Write a story for Georgians, lower taxes, you know,
historic, continued historic economic development projects
all over this state.
I like to remind myself of this, so I'll remind y'all
the best place in this nation in which to do business
for the last 10 years running.
And we're not going to jeopardize that,
But we're going to make a few changes.
All the time, we've done all these things,
working together.
We've managed, as you also know, to put together
a $16 billion surplus for the people of our state.
All the while, as we put that surplus together,
accumulated that surplus and saved it,
we've cut taxes and benefited Georgians
by at least $5 billion.
And along with that, I promise my folks everywhere I go,
when I speak to my local groups at home or wherever I may be,
that we want to be, we are good stewards
of our tax money, yours, mine, these gentlemen.
So we're making good investments.
We want to make sure those investments
are receiving and creating jobs in our state,
in our local communities.
But for the very best return on investment,
that we can possibly receive
because at the end of the day, that's our job
and that's what we're about.
I think today's announcements
continues us in the right direction
and a very responsible direction,
one that is a fiscally sound position
that continues to move our state forward.
Now, one of the things that Chairman Blackman mentioned,
well, we're looking at rebalancing, if you will,
when it comes to incentivizing our data centers
in this state, which is an important part of our success, but we know that these
data centers currently use a disproportionate amount of our state's energy. We
have to make sure that we are balanced with that, that we have to resource us
available. We also know that we've heard a lot of talk about this with our film
tax credit, which has been very, very successful for Georgia. We want to make
sure that we streamline our text credit so we continue to get the absolute best
return on that investment for Georgia because if we don't we won't remain the
number one state in this union in which stupidness and we are I believe as
these folks behind me believe and I believe we've demonstrated the house
along with Lieutenant Governor Jones, Chairman Blackman, Chairman Husteadler as
As we've worked, as they've worked, over this interim since last year, to put these great
ideas in place to ensure that all of the work we've done continues to be a reality and
making Georgia this best place that I've heard about to live, work, and raise a family.
So that's what we're trying to do.
Now we'll open this up.
If you're good with that,
you're trying to go to Willa,
Willa at these two chairman,
answer some questions about what we're doing.
So with that, we'd be glad to take some questions
and we'll get the appropriate answer from the appropriate person.
So thank y'all for being here with us.
Thank you for giving us this courage.
We look forward to your questions.
No, sir, you go.
Will that Chairman Blackman take a stab at that one, right?
It would just be a function of the annual budget.
So the prior year's budget revenue, you would look at a 2.5% on transferability.
It doesn't limit what can be earned and what can be exercised.
It just limits the state's exposure on an annual basis and any credits would roll over
into the next year.
Well, if you look at that, that's 900 million right now, right, or an excess of 900 million.
You could redeem all that you could take
under your current tax obligation that you choose,
but the transferability would be limited
to that two and a half percent amount annually,
and anybody that didn't get covered in that particular year
would roll into the next year
so that you're not losing any credits
and you would get an extra year carry forward
in addition to that.
I'd be happy to talk about it more offline.
I know it's a complicated measure.
Another question.
I think what Chairman Blackman has over here is a method to make sure that there's not
a open-ended cost that when he says he's going to limit the transfer of
ability and this will come into the Senate that it would spread it out and not
give the state government budget a huge liability in one year because some of
these have kept over several years they could all be redeemed in one year so
he's trying to protect the budget and smooth the process out it doesn't really
change the tax credit set out there but we've got to continue to look at this
And I think we need to look at, you know, anybody that pays taxes in Georgia doesn't have
to transfer them.
So we might have encouraged some companies to move to Georgia in the process as well.
Well, you know, the process, of course, is it goes through the houseways and manage
over to the full house to the Senate Finance Committee and then under the
floor and the governor so you know it's our certainly I hope to have this done
in this session.
