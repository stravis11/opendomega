TRANSCRIPT
----------
You
Thank you for allowing us all to be here today. God I pray that you give us clear minds
so that we can think through and make the best decisions for the people of Georgia.
name a pray amen. Thank you. We have two bills today. House Bill 1078. Chairman
of Petrie is here and House Bill 1083. Leader Bruce Williamson is not here and
I'm gonna be doing that one so I'm gonna give you a little heads up. I'm giving you
no heads up until just now so apologize about that. If I'm sure you can handle it.
So Representative Petrie you can be here or there. You want to sit down. That's
That's great.
Witness number two and we do have on 1078 we got one, two, three people that have signed
up so tell us a little bit about your bill and the floor is yours.
Thank you Chairman and my understanding is my senator is going to be carrying this bill.
So I think you got this one also.
Happy to do it.
All right so Mr. Chairman House Bill 1078 this is a Department of Community Health Bill.
I think most of you may be aware last year the department began studying the idea of
doing a pace program in Georgia and what this bill is is the enabling legislation for
the Department of Community Health to develop and implement a pace program. Paces in acronym
which is program of all inclusive care for the elderly and Mr. Chairman you and I have
We had some experience with the source program and in our careers at home, a wavered service
that long ago was really almost patterned after pace, although it was a waver and it was
not a capitated program like pace.
This is a true pace program, the goal, give people opportunity to stay out of institutions,
keep them in the community longer.
When we do that, we save money for taxpayers by keeping people in a less institutional setting
and we give people a better quality of life.
So what this program does is basically the provider
would provide all of the kind of all-inclusive care
for these individuals that are gonna be
age-blind and disabled, duly eligible,
Medicaid and Medicare.
And so they're providing the preventative care,
the primary care, the acute care, and the long-term care.
All of that is provided by these individuals.
It's a voluntary program.
They choose this as an alternative institutional placement.
And I said earlier, it's a capitated program.
That's what makes it different from our waivers
that serve this population today.
It's currently in 32 states.
I do want to emphasize that initially,
there'll be three sites, Fulton County,
and these were sites that were studied by the department,
had the population that could benefit from the services,
Fulton County, Bibb County, and Chatham County.
I think that's
Pretty much explains it. Mr. Chairman glad to answer any questions
We have any questions from the committee if not we have two people. I'm sorry three people that wanted to test fine
All right
Hey, my friend from chat. I'm great to have you here
so to understand
And again, I'm not I'm not by any means an expert of this and I just appreciate your expertise
So, if somebody goes into an institutional setting now, obviously the institution that takes
them in has full responsibility for their well-being.
If they're at a home setting, they get services, but there's no strict duty to provide those
services.
That if someone doesn't show up, it's kind of a, I mean, I've had constituents that have
called me that they're getting home care.
And if the person doesn't show up to change their diaper and bring food to them, it's
It's like, oh, sorry, we missed it today.
We'll come back tomorrow, maybe, and it's just,
there's not this duty.
Does this create the same duty that you have
if you're an institution setting that you provide care?
Yeah, so let me, first of all, say,
so we don't know where there's,
in that analogy you just use,
is that private sector services?
Is it services to a Medicaid waiver?
It could be, is it home health through Medicare?
So it could be from a multitude of angles,
but to answer your, I think your question
you're looking for,
is somebody going to oversight all of this
to see that those services are provided yes,
and that would be the pace provider.
And so, yes, it will better ensure
that those kind of gaps don't happen.
That's correct.
And I know we don't like to talk about lawsuits and stuff.
I'm just talking about real legal duties,
and they have a legal duty to provide the care.
It's not a sort of a secondary service then.
It's that, okay.
It's an all, they accept it.
So the provider that chooses to be a pace provider,
and there are three now that are interested
and we're working with the department.
They're taking on that burden
to provide all of the care needed for that individual.
So if a family member of the person getting care
saw that they were missed two, three days in a row
or weren't getting critical things,
you'd have the basis of a suit.
You can actually force them to do that
because today you don't have an action to do that.
Well, I think what, so what would happen,
So in the world we live in today,
I wanna make sure I'm speaking clearly of this.
So we can't ensure that always an employee
is gonna show up one time or something of that nature.
What I'm saying is that provider,
their duty is to make sure that if somebody's not there,
they get somebody else there,
which by the way is already the duty
of home care under licensure.
So, but I can't tell you that there's not failures
because there are failures as we all know
in hospitals every day, in skilled nurse facilities every day,
and yes, in community-based services every day.
But the folks that are, whose duty it is to see
that that individual is being served and served well,
it will be the provider, the pace provider of these individuals
that voluntary choose this, voluntary choose this service
as an alternative to skilled at skilled nursing home placement.
I love this Bill, Ms. Chairman.
I just had to ask that question.
I want to thank you.
Good question.
I won't belabor the point out of constituent
who is wheelchair bound, can't get out of the wheelchair
and bathe themselves, would have sat in his own business
for 60 straight days.
No one came and checked on him for 60 days.
Only friends did that for him.
Because when you get home care now as a disabled person,
it's not the, I don't know the right term,
it's not the obligation that you have
when you're in an institutional setting.
And if this closes that gap, that would be a huge use.
So was this in a skill nursing facility or this was at home?
They were at home.
They were at home, I got you.
And they choose to be there.
They could have been in a skill nursing office.
Part of the qualification, just an education for the committee
and folks listening is that they had to be eligible for a skill
nursing facility, IE nursing home.
They're going to meet a level of care.
To be eligible for this program.
Yes, sir.
And that's, and he was, opted to be home and it sounded like it.
But we opted to be home.
That was the fatal mix.
Once he opted to be his home, he didn't have the guarantee.
All right, so I'll say one last thing,
Mr. Chairman, if I may, to the very good question.
Senator Sessler, so here's where I think
this would be advantageous.
Unlike some of the other programs,
like through Medicaid waivers, maybe,
and where you might have limited choices,
so here's what'll happen with a program like this.
The provider, if they discover that the individual
being served says, I don't like ABC,
I don't like this agency, they can replace them
and put somebody else in there.
And they have free reign to do that.
And so I think that, again, as you get feedback
from the individual serve, your goal is make sure
they get served and also make sure they're satisfied.
Because again, they're choosing the services
and alternative to skilled.
Remember, so just to be clear,
everybody is entitled to skilled nursing home placement.
It is an entitlement.
Home and community-based services are not entitlements.
And so people choose this and yes,
somebody's failing, replace them.
And I think this makes it easier for a program
that the Pace Provider to say,
you're failing us, you're out,
we've put in somebody new in.
So I think it helps resolve that problem.
Appreciate we have Deborah Stokes
and then Tom Bauer and then Kathleen Benton,
I'll be less.
Which everyone you wanna do?
Now's good, all right?
I'm sorry, I skipped my vice chair.
Yeah, I really like this idea, Mr. Chair.
but I had two questions for you.
One is, can someone go from a SNF to PACE?
In other words, once they're in a skilled nursing,
if it seems appropriate that they could be provided
service at home, can it go that direction?
Unless someone here with the department
tells me otherwise, my answer is absolutely that case.
OK, and then the second thing is you said
several times it's voluntary.
What's the outreach going to look like?
How are people going to know that they have this option?
That might be better coming from the department,
but that's a great question, Senator,
and I think the department might better answer that.
We have, let's do three people to testify,
and then we'll talk about questions
and go from there.
Mistokes.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And committee, this, my name is Deborah Stokes,
I'm Executive Director of the Georgia Council on Aging,
and it's Coalition of Advocates for Georgia's Elderly.
We are very much in favor of this legislation
as it will help the growing aging population be able
to stay home longer.
And we know that that is the goal,
that is the best place for our seniors to be,
is at home with all of the services that they need.
So we are very much in favor of this bill.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Tom Bauer.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Members of the Committee, I'm Tom Bauer with Leading H. Georgia.
We serve at least 125,000 seniors in our various facilities and adult day
centers, so we cover the gamut from Lopscale Retirement to subsidized
housing.
Ms. Stokes was very eloquent exactly on why we're supporting this bill.
We would like to see as many options as possible for seniors to get the
services they need, access the services without being in skilled nursing.
In particular, we have many subsidized homes and hug facilities and things like that.
And these are folks who are living independently and they're going to get to a point where
they can't live alone.
And this would be another tool in the toolbox to use the phrase that everybody uses around
here.
So we very much support the bill.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Bower.
And Kathleen Benton.
I'm Kathleen Benton and I'm the CEO of Hospice Savannah and we're out of Chatham County.
I'm an interested provider in pace and I've actually been studying pace across the country
for the last two years to see the benefits it could have in our own state.
At all of our neighboring states actually have pace as well and it's actually very instrumental.
We serve about 4,000 patients and caregivers, so we've seen the deficits just as you've
talked about in what we can't do in health care.
And PACE is an excellent disruptor to all of that.
Very briefly, I felt that it's helpful for you to meet a fictional patient named Mary.
Mary is a patient that we see every day, an 85-year-old with congestive heart failure,
Alzheimer's that is advancing impulmonary disease.
Her son and daughter work every single day to get her to the neurologist, the cardiologist,
the primary care.
She's dealing with what she's talking about as far as home caregivers who don't show
up.
The family is exhausting themselves, supplementing these home caregivers.
And Mary doesn't want to go to the nursing home, though she is eligible.
The family is exhausting themselves.
care resources are being exhausted, Mary's gone in the hospital seven times in a year.
She's gone to the emergency room with falls three times in the last year.
So how could the trajectory be different for Mary's family with pace?
Inter pace and you have immediate transportation.
So the first step is to take this off the family, the home caregivers go into the home and
get Mary ready every day.
In answer to your question, if they don't show up, the entire team knows about it because
you also have interdisciplinary review of the providers and you have the transportation
group that will be out there to pick up Mary for one of her appointments that are scheduled
to see neurology or cardiology.
Then Mary will be taken to the PACE clinic.
This is a structured building that is built around the needs of patients.
If Mary needs fluids that day to make sure that she's not left dehydrated, if Mary needs
physical therapy to make sure that she doesn't fall when she gets home, all of that occurs
during the day.
So Mary is well taken care of and reviewed by this PACE program.
And at night, Mary goes home.
Sometimes the family helps to get her to bed if they're not there because they're out
of town or because they just can't do it with all they're doing working
themselves, then the pace will also show up to the home and make sure that Mary
gets a nice meal and goes to bed. If Mary needs her hair fixed the next day or
needs the dentist, the pace covers that. If Mary has a fall in the home in the
middle of the night and needs to call 911, the pace meets her at the emergency
room, make sure she doesn't stay at the hospital too long, that a subsequent
surgery goes well, and even rehabilitation in the nursing home is followed. You
utilize all of the services that are in health care, but you bind them all
together with the pace. And that's really the benefit of having this program in
our state. I'm also open to take any questions, but I'll say I'm so grateful to
Senator Watson, I'm so grateful to
Representative Petrie and to the
Department of Community Health for
supporting this innovative program.
Put simply it will help keep people
in their homes with round the clock
care and really help families do this.
Any questions?
Senator Sassler?
Hard hold on, let me get your mic.
Okay.
Just very simply again I'm excited
to appreciate your being in this
and I appreciate your very clear
presentation that's what I was
looking for.
So to be clear, the pace provider is fully accountable for their outcome.
Fully accountable and fully accountable to the bottom line.
If they don't do a good job, they're going to pay more because Mary or any other patient
is not going to do as well in the health care continuum.
Thank you.
No, I got you.
I see. Everybody see that particular point she made.
Eight center Hodges.
I would imagine there's a substantial difference in cost.
Can you speak to that a little bit?
Absolutely.
In compared to nursing home patients, it's about a 12% cost reduction with pace.
And most of that is because the care is no longer disjointed and the capitated network
is motivated to make sure that there's no redundancies.
So for example, if the patient's going to a neurologist and a nephrologist, all of that
is married together in the interdisciplinary team.
Medication management is very thorough and there's less hospitalizations and less number
of days in the hospital during the hospitalizations, which allows the resource reduction.
In other words, it is since your assessor said, if someone doesn't show up and they get
a bed soar is going to cost them a lot more money and their capital their
capitated fee will certainly not cover their call spainy means so they're
mo they're motivated on multiple different levels exactly so and it's it's
generally cheaper to provide care and in someone's home than it is in a
skilled nursing facility.
The other questions must be in we sure appreciate you coming that was very
insightful appreciate your example there.
thank you thank you oh you know I apologize okay all right you're on number
10 no 11 okay about a way just the internet apparently is down yeah and but
our we're being taped and it will be available later if anybody is dying to
listen to us again. Mr. Hood for the Department of Community Health, thank you
Senator Chairman Huffsteadler has a question. So we had looked at a model a
year or so ago where on our subsidized housing we had people that we were
trying to mingle on the same floor and the rules wouldn't let us do it. I don't
know if you're familiar with that or not. We're trying to get a pilot done on it.
Yes, sir. I think I'm familiar with what you're referencing so so and and we never really got to where one of my question is does this help in that?
I think it does because those individual members as was referenced earlier and subsidized housing they would be in a
Individually if they meet the sniff level of care they would be able to enroll when still saying that subsidized housing and then they would have all the
Benefits that that pace would offer and it doesn't have the
doesn't have the restrictions that have a licensure
that you're referencing.
So they're not mutually exclusive?
Right.
Okay.
Senator Chairman, Hustetler, number five,
still shouldn't have that memorized, shouldn't I?
Yeah, okay.
Well, make a quick, the geography,
we talked about Fulton, Bib, Chatham,
what's the prospects of this being a statewide thing
and what's gonna be required to do that?
Yes, sir.
So what we've done is last year,
the legislature directed us to do an assessment.
We reached out to the National Peace Organization
and they have a formula which goes through an algorithm
and demonstrates where peace would be most successful
and where there's sufficient numbers of eligible members
to make it successful from an investment standpoint
and operational standpoint.
And in doing so, we asked for those specific locations
because we had interested parties that already had facilities
there to that would go to a pace organization.
You basically have to have a 10,000 square foot building
that would meet the services that were referenced earlier
in testimony.
And then you can serve a population of zip codes that surround
that within a certain mile radius.
With their algorithm, they demonstrated
that those three had that.
Largely, we think that other population centers
are going to be eligible.
We didn't specifically look at those
because we didn't have the same interests
that had been demonstrated.
But certainly, Fulton and DeCavs showed the greatest number of populations you might expect,
but also expect Cobb, Gwyneth, Columbus, Augusta, so forth, you know, we qualify.
But if we act on this and the CEO who spoke to us who's doing this in Chatham decided,
you know what, I'm going to open up a Cracker Jack facility in Gwyneth County, that
can start providing the service as long as the capabilities there or do we need to
appropriate dollars, do we need to act again legislatively or where does that stand?
Sure, let me explain it a little bit further.
So what has to happen, what this is authorizing the department
to do is to go to CMS and submit a spa
to add this to our state plan to authorize
paste services as a Medicaid covered service.
Paste is a Medicare program.
It's in a number of states, but it's set.
All the rules and regulations are set by Medicare,
which is why this legislation is really so, so small.
Because we're going to rely upon everything
that Medicare has as an impolining entity.
And they're just to add to that.
They're also a subsidy to this program.
They pay a substantial amount for those
who are dual-eligible.
And this is largely focused at a Medicare population.
If we did not have PACE, which we don't have today,
all the other things that we offer that are on Medicaid
are 100% state match.
So this has this subsidy from Medicare as well.
So with that, that's how we will implement.
but in doing so to identify locations,
what we have to do is to make sure
that there's a readiness component of that.
The way that we initially intend to do that
is to hire a contractor to go out
and do what is known as a request for qualified vendors.
They'll set out all the things that would be necessary,
largely that building and staffing and all the things
to demonstrate that a facility is going to be ready
within a certain time frame.
and that's really why we focused on these three
because we knew we had to identify providers
who likely would be able to meet that.
If we see additional interest,
we would come back the next year
and then we would do that again
and allow for those additional providers,
which is what we expect to do.
I will say,
I do expect that it might acquire additional appropriations.
We've only got a small number of this year.
If we have to do additional administrative tasks
and actuarial services and all that at a larger scale,
we do anticipate that we would bring that forward as needed.
Thank you, Mr. Hood.
Chairman Walker.
I'm on board.
My follow-up even though I'm not even on the internet,
but like the concept, certainly,
I wondered if meals are part of it.
And my other question is, well, I have two questions
if you don't mind, Mr. Chairman.
So I believe that it's contemplated anything, any service component that they would need
that they would have met.
I mean, it's a total managed care model.
So if there's that need, then I suspect that they will find a means to do that, whether
it's through its other service programs to provide meals or meals on wheels or whatever
the case may be, it's going to vary probably depending upon that person's circumstance.
I expect the facility, which really acts in addition to the health care component, really
as a senior services center, that they have activities and meals and all the things that
are associated with that, but I think it's going to vary to be honest, Senator.
Thank you.
You have the follow-up question.
Yes, sir.
You mentioned it's like a capitated fee, and so there's an incentive from the provider,
the pace provider to use these wraparound services and try to keep them out of the hospital
and that kind of thing.
But it also seems, it says, transportation is included.
I mean, what if they are real profit-oriented and are like,
no, we're not going to take you to get your haircut or,
you know, you already did that.
We're only going to do that six times a year or,
I mean, who's overlooking all this and making sure
of the making money that can get in the way of taking care of the patient or the patient.
So a pace program is going to be very equivalent to a license program, even though we're not
seeking license, we're going to follow all of the certification through the Medicare
guidance.
So they would be able to complain to the department, it would meet that similar complaint.
And then just as a reminder, this is a total voluntary program, if they're truly dissatisfied
and can't reach resolution, they can disemroll and go back to regular Medicaid services
whether that be HCBS or they could go to a nursing home.
I will say that if they don't, if they digress and they end up in a nursing home though
in the PACE program, PACE is responsible for that nursing home care.
So there's truly incentive to try and keep them not only out of the hospital but out of
the nursing home.
Makes sense.
Got you.
just add one thing to that.
So this is all value-based cares what it sounds like.
And incentives are for the quality to drive the cost, right?
So the outcome should be there's motivation for the outcomes
to be better, but then cost less money.
I mean, that's how value-based programs work.
That's right.
I mean, how often does it say in this committee
that the quality drives price, right?
Number two, three.
Thank you for being with us, and I apologize that the chairman had presented his bill pretty
much almost completed when I got here, so if I'm being repetitive, I apologize.
But we've had a community-based services for eons, and it's been characterized as being
underfunded. You know, we're always pushing for more funding of community-based services.
How does that reality sync up with this proposal?
Yes, ma'am. Senator, I'll answer that, and then Joe needs to, he can as well. So, to
me, they live together. So, you're right. For many years now, we've been trying to continue
to increase funding for home and community-based services, largely through Medicaid waivers
to keep people in the community longer, who do have a skilled nursing home
level of care. And we're doing that. We continue to do that. This will give us
just another route, another choice, if you will, for individuals who have
Medicare and Medicaid to do it a different way. So it's not through a
Medicaid waiver, but it's through this this pace model. And which is a
episode, it's different entirely from a fee for service provider through
home community, community-based services because it's a
They're all fee for service at this time and so this will be different, but it just gives
another choice for that same population, same population, different option.
So it's just another way of serving people who, as we all know, are the people really
Medicare has all the way back to the 60s been most targeted to, age blind, disabled,
elderly and so it kind of captures that group with another opportunity is the way
I would describe it and Joe may have a better answer. Mr. Hood, anything to add?
Yes just just one other thing and that is remember this is a
capitated rate and as the chairman referenced the community-based services on
a waiver and those rates are Medicaid rates which are really at the to raise
those rates are you know would be an ask to the legislature to do I mean you
been very kind this past year. We've raised rates for the first time for many of those waiver
programs in a long time. The difference here is a capitated rate, much like the CMOs,
it gets done by an actuary every year. And these are largely driven by Medicare rates
because this is a Medicare program. So not really set by Medicaid. So you've got an actuarial
rate, which is going to be revisited every year and updated. And then you've also got the
Medicare participation, which is driving that, which ensures that you're going to get
a competitive rate and that it's going to remain so as you go forward.
It sounds like why is it taking us so long, right?
Okay.
Any other questions from the committee?
Thank you, Mr. Hood, Chief Operating Officer of DCH.
So, is it anticipated that this approach will have a cost savings that the home community
based care does not have?
It's a cheaper, less costly way to deliver with the hope of better services, I mean,
is that?
I would describe it, Mr. Hood may have to answer that.
They both offer savings, traumatic cost savings over skilled nursing, institutional placement,
so the degree to which one may be cheaper than the other, it may be that Mr. Hood should
answer.
Well, Medicare is subsidizing this program, so I mean, I would say that's a large part
of why we expect savings.
I don't know, there's certainly not going to be savings per se immediately because what
you're doing is you're going from a standard of care where there is no
management. Largely, most of these members are in fee for service today and they
are managing their own care. And then what would traditionally happen is they
would reach a point where they have to go to the nursing home. They're
family or themselves and then they go. If they elected pace, then that option
would divert them from a nursing home. It's you're going to see savings
because of that managed care over time and the diversion from the nursing
home, but from a financial standpoint this next year, I don't expect to see savings.
We did a review of that, and what we expect is that it's budget neutral in the first years,
but it's really difficult to pin that down because you're trying to estimate who is indeed
going to go to a nursing home versus not, and we did our best attempt with that with the
actuaries and determined that we believe we'd budget neutral.
And the long term, of course, we would have savings because we would not be sending people
to a nursing home and keeping now the hospital and just just the managed care component
part.
But yet this bill exempts pace from meeting the requirements of a managed care organization,
right?
Right.
Because we are using the Medicare standards and all the Medicare certifications and that's
what we want to use to manage the program because of that subsidy and their participation.
That's the reason for that.
as if you had a CMO, that is not the case, that is purely Medicaid, or if you had an HMO
like Kaiser, that's a private entity, that's generally what's expected for in the statute
and what it would regulate, and this is separate and important because of the Medicare component.
Right, and I think the state, an important difference is that there's a management of
the overall needs of the client,
as opposed to relying on the client's own personal support
system to manage all that.
Isn't that absolutely?
Absolutely.
It's a piece of the puzzle, as we like to say here.
All righty, I'm not sure there's a wrap up
that's needed on this one.
So the consideration is wrapping up.
I got Senator Chairman Sessler says, move, do pass.
We have a seconded.
We'll do Chairman Walker and any further discussion.
Can't imagine there would be.
So we are, all those in favor say aye.
All those opposed, like sign passes unanimously.
Thank you, Chairman Petru,
and I'll be happy to carry that bill.
Thank you, Chairman.
I'll get it to you.
All right, I'm, as I said earlier,
We're going to swap out here, because later Williamson is not here.
I'm going to carry the bill for him, so I'm going to turn it over to my vice chair.
Okay, our next bill is House Bill 1083, and that's representative Williamson's bill.
And they else say that I have is 540348S, which is a committee sub.
that what you have, Senator Watson.
That is it.
Okay, floor yours.
Thank you chair lady.
This has basically a date change.
We're relating to adult residential mental health programs.
We passed this legislation a couple years ago
and the rules took longer than we anticipated
longer than we anticipated, but the rules have been done.
They just didn't get done until the end of last year.
So folks who have been in this adult residential mental health program
have had provisional licenses.
And this just basically extends the license from, as you'll see,
from those dates on lines 30 from December to June.
about a year and a half and the same for line 33 and then again about a year
and a half on line 38. And that's it. I have one question for you. So is it
correct that the rules have been promulgated but they just haven't had the
public comment period and all that or they have not been promulgated? Yeah I'd
love that. Mr. Hood can save me. So the rules have we had draft rules and we had public
comment and we have not reached resolution on all the public comment that was there and
some of those comments were from the primary provider who had the provisional license.
So we need additional time to get to a place where we feel comfortable to come back to
the board and adopt final rules to try and work through those commentary. We certainly
want don't want to displace the provisional license that is in place. So the
legislation is to extend that while we continue to work through that process.
Okay questions from the committee. We have one person signed up to speak. Stan
Jones? Joe Hood has reported what I would have said. Stan Jones, the
represent Scallon Trail, which is the provider
that it's been a partial care on before.
And we added a residential subacute program for jobs
like we had on the show.
We'll just need a little more time to get finished.
Thank you.
OK, any questions?
OK.
OK, we have a motion due pass by substitute, right?
Yeah, LC 540-348S, and we need a second.
Okay, Senator Butler, and any further discussion?
Okay, all in favor say aye.
Aye.
Opposed, same sign.
Okay, the bill passes, by substitute.
Thank you.
So just a heads up on our Wednesday we'll be meeting we have three or four bills that
are already teed up and we'll continue to march three we have really counting this
when we have four meetings maybe five meetings to get all the bills done and that's not
just for HHS, that's for everybody.
So just FYI, I really appreciate that meeting adjourned.
