Thank you, Representative C. Ball.
Have all members voted?
Have all members voted.
If so, the clerk will lock the machines.
Do you have someone who didn't vote, Ms. Clerk?
The doorkeepers will please close the doors and keep them closed.
As our custom, we will begin our day with Scripture reading and a prayer by the chaplain, after which
which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the lady from the 54th House District
Representative Betsy Holland.
Representative.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good morning, colleagues.
I could not be more excited to introduce my pastor today and to recognize some of our
church family who are here in the gallery to see us.
The Reverend Emma Nyshloss serves us at Morningside Presbyterian Church as our associate
pastor.
She oversees adult education, our community outreach, and our mission work, and perhaps
most importantly, as the parent of a teenager, she is our youth pastor.
Pastor Emma, because that's easier to say than the Reverend Emma Nyshloss, a pastor Emma
is celebrating her fifth year at Morningside, just had her anniversary.
That's easy for me to remember, because I had the honor of chairing the search committee
that brought her to Atlanta.
She's a graduate of Princeton Theological Seminary
and came to us from Pittsburgh.
So while she's not a native Georgian,
y'all I got her here as fast as I possibly could.
Emma is gifted from the pulpit
and obviously a great congregational leader.
There were two things that when
chairing the search committee
released it out to me that made her a top choice.
One was sentimental.
She went to the same seminary as my dad.
The second was when we both discovered
we were rabid fans of the television show The West Wing
and loved presidential and political trivia.
So when you meet her in the anti-broom,
you can try to stump her with some presidential knowledge.
I am so grateful to the speaker for allowing us
to have her here today and to hear her message.
So please welcome Pastor M. Nysloss.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker,
and thank you, Representative Holland.
It is a great honor and a joy to be with all of you
this morning. As Representative Holland said, I came to the great state of Georgia just
over five years ago, and I will be honest, I never imagined myself living in Georgia,
and that's nothing against the state of Georgia. It's just very far from my beloved home
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and you all don't have a professional hockey team, which is
tough for me. But I feel called to ministry, and so when I felt a call to the congregation
and I serve, I came.
I imagine that you all know a little bit
of what that feels like,
perhaps not in the leaving of home
or the longing for NHL hockey,
but in the decision to say yes
to something that demands big things from us.
The choice to enter into public service
was not a small or an easy one, I imagine.
Your lives are different because you answered a call,
whether from your constituents, your creator,
from the state of Georgia.
And even though our jobs are very different,
we are all here today answering our respective calls.
So in the few short minutes I have with you this morning,
I thought that I might offer a way to respond to our calls
using what I am willing to claim
is the most important verse in the Old Testament.
And I know that that is a bold claim,
but the most important verse in the Old Testament
is found in Deuteronomy 22.
Now, Deuteronomy is chock full of laws for living.
It contains everything from how you treat foreigners
to how to worship God, to how to plant and sow your vineyards.
It's important to be sure, but it's often very granular.
And Deuteronomy 22 is no exception.
It opens with instructions for how
to treat your neighbor's livestock.
If your neighbor's ox wanders off, you care for it.
You take it home.
If you don't know where the ox belongs,
you take it into your home and treat it as your own
until his owner comes to find him.
This may seem like common sense.
It may seem wholly unimportant,
but right there in the midst of these verses
is this important phrase,
you shall not withhold your help.
Though perhaps a closer translation is,
you shall not remain indifferent.
If you see a lost ox or a lost donkey,
you shall not, will not refuse to help.
With this declaration, we are given less of a law to follow
and more of an approach to life.
We must be oriented toward being engaged,
being not only aware of needs of injustices,
but having a desire and a motivation
to do something about it.
This simple phrase tells us what our call is,
what our jobs are.
And we see the places that help is needed, and then we do something about it.
It leaves us no room for not my pig, not my farm kind of attitude.
We cannot turn away from need.
I imagine that each of you over the course of your tenure has been and will continue to
be confronted with needs and injustices and wrongdoings, both big and small.
I also imagine that there will be times
when it feels difficult to act.
The problem feels too overwhelming.
You just don't have the time.
The issue doesn't garner much media attention.
The solution costs too much money or worse.
The solution was suggested by a member of the other party.
And yet, we cannot remain indifferent.
I know that we are all humans incapable
of writing every wrong, healing every hurt,
mending every broken place and yet that should never dissuade us from trying because we have
said yes to a call because there are problems and hurts in our communities because we refuse
to turn away.
There is yet another translation of Deuteronomy 22-3, you shall not hide from yourself.
help to someone, to everyone, is part of what it means to be human. It is a fundamental
part of who we are created to be and who we are called to be. It is my hope that as you
do the important work of this legislative season that you will not hide from yourselves.
As you strive to serve Georgia, as each of us seeks to live into our call, may we never
be indifferent. Let us pray. God who goes by many names today, we will call you love. May love
drive out fear and pave the way for peace and give birth to new things. Inspire us and
empower us to push back against apathy, indifference, and selfish gain that we may answer the call
you have placed on our lives. Work in and through us that we may, with all of our ability, love and
serve our neighbors as we love ourselves. Open our eyes to the needs around us. Give us minds that
strive for new solutions. May our hearts be set on fire. Remind us what it means to be human.
God of love, give us grace to risk something big for something good. And grace to remember that
that the world is now too dangerous for anything but the truth and too small for anything but love. Amen.
You
Doorkypers will unlock the doors and as our custom members may greet the
chaplain in the south anti-room. Chair now recognizes Chairman Tarvan, the
chair of the committee on information and audits. Chairman Tarvan. Mr. Speaker your
committee on information and audits has read the legislative journal from a
previous legislative day and found it to be correct and on another note we
We cannot change the direction of the wind, but we can adjust our sails to reach our destination.
Terrible words were never spoken, Chairman Tarvan.
Chairman Tarvan, the chair of the Committee on Information and Audits,

This is something near and dear to all of us that happened this last week that Georgia State
Patrol just wanted to, how to make a statement, the ones that protect us here at the Capitol
and protect us around the state.
And I just want to read a little statement from them.
On Wednesday, January 18, 2023, the Georgia State Patrol
special weapons and tactics SWAT team was requested
to assist the Georgia Bureau of Investigation
in Atlanta Police Department and the Cab Police Department
with an operation to identify people
who were trespassing and committing other crimes
on the side of a future city of Atlanta Police Safety
Training Center.
On such date at 9 AM, state troopers of the SWAT team
were moving through the property
with other law enforcement officers and located a man
inside of a tent in the woods.
The state troopers gave the man commands to leave the tent
and identify himself under the threat of being arrested
for criminal trespass.
The man refused to comply with the troopers commands
and even after being told he was under arrest
and needed to exit the tent immediately.
The man fired a nine millimeter handgun
in the direction of the troopers,
striking one in the abdomen area.
The other state troopers immediately returned fire striking the man.
Law enforcement officers worked quickly to evacuate the injured trooper to a safe area
where he was transported to a local hospital.
The trooper was rushed in emergency surgery and currently in stable condition resting at
a local hospital.
The man who fired upon the law enforcement officers pronounced deceased at the scene.
It was later discovered the farm used was illegally purchased in September 2020 by the
shooter identified as manual Esteban Paz Tehran. The handgun used was identified as a Smith
and Wesson M&P shield 9 millimeter. This is a statement by the Georgia State Patrol.
And just please keep all that we're involved in this in our prayers. Thank you.
Thank you, Representative. Representative Nullowicz is recognized for a afternoon
order. Hi, everyone. This is your annual reminder that January is cervical cancer
awareness month in Georgia and in the United States. More than 15,000 women
annually in the United States are diagnosed with cervical cancer. Around 500 of
these are in Georgia. Around 4,200 women die every year of cervical cancer.
It's a 140 women in Georgia who we lose every year to cervical cancer, and the thing
about cervical cancer, it is incredibly treatable.
One in five women in Georgia, though, don't get the screening that can detect and prevent
cervical cancer, so they can be treated early.
What's astonishing about cervical cancer is that 95% of cervical cancers are caused by
the HPV virus, that's the human papillomavirus, and the great thing, the miracle of this, is
that there is a vaccine for HPV.
It is available to every teenager and young adult in Georgia.
My two teenagers are fully vaccinated against HPV,
which means that they are probably never going to face
one of these cervical cancers and also a lot of head
and neck cancers that are related to the HPV virus.
I encourage everyone to learn more about the HPV virus
and the vaccine and the reality of cervical cancer
in Georgia and in the United States.
This is cervical cancer awareness month.
We had an organization that was down here
at the Capitol last week.
We have a resolution in their honor.
I'm going to be circulating.
And I hope that you will take the moment
to read some of the facts that were put on your desk
yesterday.
Thank you so much.
Thank you, Representative, for that information.
Chairman Mitchell is recognized for an even order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I first of all want to thank my friend and colleague,
Representative Katie Dempsey,
for pointing out the imminent unwinding
of the Medicaid throughout the COVID-19,
the pandemic and public health emergency states
have been required to suspend termination
of coverage of individuals who are already enrolled
because of in Medicaid, this continuous coverage
will in, and I want to thank her because this is an issue that our caucus has been working
on as well. And in bipartisan support of her efforts, I would encourage you all to join
our efforts, and particularly the leader has sponsored HB37. The unwinding official name
is the family's first coronavirus response act, 41% of percentage increase in Georgia
Medicaid enrollment since the start of COVID-19 has happened. It is estimated that almost
over a half a million Georgians who will lose Medicaid coverage after the unwinding and
it will take 14 months. Georgia has to complete all re-determinations. So what I would encourage
you to, in a bipartisan support, of course, to support this effort.
And of course, we have another bill sponsored by the leader to expand Medicaid in its entirety.
With that, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank you.
Thank you, Representative.
The chair now recognizes Representative Becky Evans for an afternoon order.
Representative?
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Colleagues, I want to call your attention to the invitation on your desk today to attend
the environmental and clean energy open house tomorrow afternoon, Wednesday the 25th.
We have lunch and networking with environmental advocates from Pro 45 to 130 and the program
will be from 130 to 230.
It's in CLOB 605 and also it's available via Zoom if you're going from one thing to
the next, and you need to work from your office. So we'll have advocates from the Georgia
Water Coalition, Georgia Solar Electrification from Oki-Phonoki, from several different
environmental and activist groups. So I invite you to join us tomorrow afternoon, 12.45
per lunch, 130 for the program. Thank you.
Thank you, Representative. Chair now recognizes Chair Lady Katie Dempsey for an afternoon
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and thank you, Rebsim Mitchell, for drawing attention to this.
That's all I want to do is make sure that you realize this is on your desk.
It's a wonderful resource.
It's really not about expanding Medicaid.
It's not about denying Medicaid.
It's the factual information that deals with the actual unwinding that we are required to
do by the federal government.
All states have been under the COVID public health emergency.
And for the next 12 month period, we must unwind and go back and check.
People who were on Medicaid were not checked as they would have been.
People who might need to be on it were also not brought in.
I know it's a very complicated subject.
It's heartfelt for many people, but our challenge each and every one of us is to make sure that
those who should have this resource do have it.
And as you hear from constituents that might have questions,
I hope that this will help you realize the planning
and actions that are related to the Medicaid unwinding
that occurred during the calendar year of 2000 and 22
and the primary risks and potential strategies
that are being taken on by those who work in this
in our state.
Thank you so much.
Thank you chair leader Dempsey and we appreciate your passion and hard work in this subject matter that completes our
afternoon
