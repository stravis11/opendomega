TRANSCRIPT
----------
The Senate debated a bill that would allow the biological and adopted children of fostering
families to access the $6,500 Georgia Promise Scholarship.
This is an important step to ensure that those people that take care of the most vulnerable
in our population have an initial incentive to do so.
Democrats objected because of the threat to families misusing the funds, as well as
we are not giving that same scholarship to the very foster children they will have in
their households.
bill passed 32 to 22 along party lines. Across the hall, the house passed a bill that would
modernize the state's 911 call center system. House bill 423 would implement geographic information
systems to more accurately locate the caller and reduce emergency response times.
Whether it be folks in rural Georgia, suburban Georgia, or in our urban centers, all across
our state, we see a great need to utilize current technology.
Also today, Senate Republicans filed legislation to investigate the new Georgia project, and
its founder, Stacey Abrams, for alleged financial misconduct.
The State Ethics Commission already investigated and levied a large fine on the organization.
But Lieutenant Governor Bert Jones says that more scrutiny is needed.
Democrats say it's a waste of time.
Lawmakers return on Monday for day 26, as the lead up to cross-over day on Thursday continues.
For GBB News, I'm Sarah Callis at the State Capitol.
