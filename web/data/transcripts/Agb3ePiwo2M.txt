Well, good morning.
another beautiful day here today and we're getting closer to the end. I'm trying
to look around see if we have a chaplain. I'm supposed to laugh on that. I do have
the honor of introducing our chaplain of the day needs no introduction to
this body. Y'all know him as the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, and I
know him as one of the best friends I have in the world, Terry England. Chairman England
is a man of integrity. I don't know anybody that's got a kinder, more gentle spirit than
And he does, and who walks close with our Lord each and every day, and it's reflected
in his life in all areas.
He and I have laughed together.
We've been to the mountain top together, into the valley together, mountain top and we're
fun, isn't it?
Yeah.
Thought so.
We buried friends together, and so I cherish the relationship that I have with him, and
I know that you're going to be in for a real treat today.
It is my honor, my personal privilege to introduce to you at this time, Deacon Terry England
of the Auburn 1st Baptist Church in Auburn, Georgia.
Well, you heard him say I was bad, just...
It was a little boy in church this past Sunday, our preacher loved him dearly, and he
gets a little long-winded sometimes, and he said in conclusion, a little boy looked at
his daddy and said, daddy, what does it in conclusion mean, and his daddy said with
him, absolutely nothing.
But good morning, everybody.
Thank you Mr. Speaker for those kind words and I can't put into words what your friendship
has meant to me and absolutely we have been on the mountain tops and we've been in the
valleys and all of those times that we've been on the mountain tops and we've been in
the valleys the thing that I know that you've known and the thing that I've known while
we were there is that the spirit was with us and walking with us and if you
know in the Psalms it talks about yeah you know I walked through the valley of
the shadow of death it says he's walking the person you are walking through the
valley of the shadow of death it doesn't say the Lord is carrying you but it says
he's walking there with you so that's something I'll always important to
remember. You know I've I wanted to do this for quite some time and I've told
Miss Kathy and told Miss Leisha before her that if we ever wind up that that
a preacher couldn't couldn't be here or whatever to to let me know and I'd been
glad to kind of pinch yet for a day so speaker mentioned I'm a
deacon in our church small little church and Auburn George Auburn first
Baptist. When I was ordained, there were four things that we were told that we
should be expected to do. One, be ready to preach the Word. Two, always be
ready to pray. Three, always, always be ready to lead someone to Christ. And four,
always be ready to take up an offering. So I'm going to ask the ushers if they will
come forward we'll take up a little offering but I don't know exactly what I'm
talking about there so several years ago when I ran for office in 2004 and
during that election cycle I had a gentleman that worked for us at our feed
store Mr. George and George was he was just a hoot but just a godly man and
And just a pleasure to be around, always smiling and always had you back.
And we joked, and a lot of ways we called him the chef, because he drove the fork lift a lot.
Well, usually in it, and inadvertently, he would stick a fork from the fork lift in a bag of feed.
So we called him the chef, because he was always checking, see if stuff was done.
But George relayed to me one day in the middle of the campaign, a dream he had.
Now, when someone tells you about a dream that they had
that involves God, you probably need to listen.
And George relayed to me that day.
He came straight to me that morning.
He'd always get there early.
And I'd always get there early.
He came straight to me in office that morning.
He said, Terry, had a dream last night.
And you need to look at James 313.
I said, okay.
Now, I understand James is my favorite book of the Bible.
Some of you may have heard me refer to the book of James
as a cliff note to the Bible,
because it kind of covers all the bases in five chapters.
And so I'm like, okay, the tongue that I got to look
and see exactly what 313 is.
So in the King James version,
who is wise man and in dude with knowledge among you?
Let him show out of a good conversation
his works with meat-ness of wisdom.
Dropping on down to verse 17,
But the wisdom that is from above is first pure,
then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated,
full of mercy and good fruits,
without partiality and without hypocrisy.
And summing up in 18, and the fruit of righteousness
is sown in peace of them that make peace.
So, read that, when I first read it in the King James,
I'm kinda like, well, was,
George kinda couldn't meet when he said that
because you know, you read it in that old English.
So you pull up a couple of different versions
and you kind of start realizing what it's saying
and what it does.
And I think you all understand what it's saying
is seek wisdom from God, seek wisdom from the one above
because that is the best wisdom.
The earthly wisdom we have carries nothing for us
but hurt and heartache.
But the wisdom from God is the wisdom
that carries us through every day.
Down in my office, there's a big whiteboard.
Many of you have been in there
and you've seen James 313 up there
in that little right hand corner.
It's been up there the entire time
that whiteboard has been there.
Just kinds of daily reminder to me
that when in those times that I think I'm super smart
or really did something great,
you know, I look up there and I see that and realize,
Well, I was just an instrument.
I was God's tool in doing that.
It wasn't me.
It was nothing about me that enabled me to do what I have done.
And that's with all of us in this room.
We may think we're super smart.
And many of you in this room are incredibly smart.
Most of you in this room are incredibly smart.
All of you in this room, I better make sure I get that right.
All of you in this room are very smart.
But, you know, the good Lord gives us that intelligence
and expects us to use it in ways that help others.
And I think, truly, we've got an aisle
and we talk about other sides, different sides of the aisle,
but I tell people at home, I tell people
wherever where I go, that while we may all
have different ideologies, and we may have different
priorities, that people come here with the heart of service,
that each of us are in this room to help people.
And we deal with a budget every year,
a big budget every year.
But the thing that we always try to remember
and Martha reminds me and I remind Martha
and our subcommittee chairs that there's a person
at the end of every one of those dollars.
And that person's the customer.
And they're expecting their state to look out for them.
You know, James goes on and talks a lot more and talks some about the tongue and how mighty
the tongue is as a as a rudder can direct a ship, a mighty ship, a little bit of rudder
can can move that ship through the waters.
So can our tongue be incredibly hurtful or incredibly helpful and that's what he reminds
it's sobbing James is to use it to be helpful so you know we do a home we still do a traditional
homecoming at our church every year it's usually a lot of part of September and our church
has been in our community for over 130 years and we're small church and a small group of folks
and we always have a good eating you know it's we look for eat we're bad just we look for
reasons to eat. So, you know,
Easter morning we have a breakfast and then Easter,
sometimes we'll have a lunch and homecoming day we'll have a breakfast
and a lunch and, you know,
so homecoming this past year, we always have some folks that are
guests that come to be with us, that family members have been part of
the church through the years and everything, so
the little lady came this year and
lives in her community and she had on one of those, I call them
calm sack dresses, you know folks used to make them out of flower sacks and
everything got two little pockets on the side and everything and this lady got
in there that morning for breakfast and she was she had a good breakfast but
we kind of got to watching and she started kind of stuffing sausage biscuits
in her pockets. Well get on in the service the preacher he's just he's he's
preaching the word and and folks being moved well she got hold of the spirit and
And come running down front at the invitation and she said,
I want to be baptized right now preacher.
I want to be baptized right now.
I want my sins washed away.
I want to be baptized right now preacher said,
I hold on a minute.
We'll get to turn the spick it on and baptism will pull
and get it full.
And so run up there and she comes down in the water.
And he dunks down in the water and all of a sudden
those biscuits come floating up out of our pockets
up on top of the water.
And one of my fellow deacons in the back of the church says,
Dunker again, preacher or sins are coming up in chunks.
But you know, the great part, the great part of baptism,
and in whichever method you do.
And I know, you know, the method to sprinkle and some
users court bottle and we always don't.
Now, when we had the drought in 2007, we went to sprinkling the methods you went to use
a damp cloth around home because it got so dry.
But there's nothing that that water actually does.
Its symbolism, but what the symbolism is, is the death of Christ and His resurrection,
where He died for our sins.
Yes, it's symbolic, but it's our public profession of faith at that point when we do that, that we've accepted that we've accepted that cleansing spirit that Jesus Christ put into our lives.
Every day, as I start my day, and I hope many of you do, and I know many of you do because you told me, we always need to ask for that wisdom from above, along with knowledge, discernment, understanding, and grace and mercy.
You know, God never moves.
We stray away from Him and going different directions.
Our lives get busy.
We've got ball games to go to and soccer matches and all those things and we stray away from
the Lord.
But I want to tell you something, the Lord will come to you.
I said He never moved, but yet He'll come to you.
about that for just a little bit. He's everywhere. He's all seen. He's all
known. He can meet us where we are. One of my favorite songs heard it last night
inspiration quartet when God dips his love into my heart. And if you let him
he'll do it. He'll do it to the point that it's overflowing. That fountain of
grace is something that we all need. As we wind down this special session, I
hope that you all turn to that grace and that mercy that he provides that he
gives so easily that he wants to give to you. As we go home next week and we're
with our families and for Thanksgiving, we all need to take time to be
thankful for those gathered around us because as we look around our
tables. There's probably going to be one that was there last year that what isn't with us this year.
But we need to be thankful for the time we have with those individuals and be thankful for the
time we have with the ones that are around the table this year. So if y'all will join me for a word of
prayer. I was kind and gracious Heavenly Father when we come to you thanking you for this day.
When we thank you for the strength that you give us, when we thank you for the mercy and grace
that you bestow upon us. Lord, most of all, we thank you for sending your Son to dial
on that cross for our sins that we may be free. Lord, as we're here today, if there's one
among us who are hearing this that doesn't know you, Lord, I pray that before this day is out,
that they would open their heart, mind, and soul that you would enter in and that they would come
to know you and come to know that love that only you can provide. Lord, we just love you and just
just thank you for giving us this opportunity to be here to represent those folks back home
our families our friends our neighbors those folks that you have placed us here in a position
of trust to do the things that you would have us to do and all we just pray that everything
that we do here and everything that we say here would be things that would be pleasing
unto you. Words that would be pleasing unto you and actions that would be pleasing unto you.
Or be with us as we go through this day, be with our speaker, be with our governor,
our lieutenant governor, all of our leaders across this nation, our president and many others,
and our men and women fighting abroad to keep us free and those protect us here at home.
But we just love you. We thank you for all that you do and all that you've done
And I love that you show us for all these things in Christ name we pray amen
y'all would join me in the pledge
I love you brother.

Kelly, it's not long to January.
D
Okay. I think we're about to get through the line here. We're going on now to
morning orders. Going to morning orders. The chair will ask all the members of
this body to take your seats and give respect to the members in the well. The
Chair recognizes for a morning order the chief deputy
whip of the majority caucus representative
Leveritt.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Ladies and gentlemen, House, I rise briefly this morning
to say a few words in memory of my mother and also to say
a couple of words about you.
Florence Kemp Leveritt was born down in Lawrence County
back in 1930 on February 4th.
And I don't know if they make everybody in Lawrence County
this way, Matt, but to say that she was outspoken
was quite an understatement.
I don't know if you got to read the obituary
that my sister, Cheryl Williams, drew,
but we should all be blessed with such a good obituary
dressman as my sister, because she nailed it.
As she said, if you didn't want to know my mother's opinion,
you'd better not ask it.
And even if you didn't ask, you might get it anyway.
Undeluted and unfiltered.
That's the way she was.
She passed away on Saturday and had been in declining health.
She lost me, we lost me that about 25 years ago,
and she missed him dearly.
But she was a wonderful lady.
It was very active all of her life until dementia
took some of that from her.
But I wanna talk a little bit about all of you.
I'm sorry I could not be here Monday for obvious reasons and I hate that Camma Clary was here
and I hate not having been here for his devotional.
But as soon as the speaker made mention that Mom had passed, my cell phone almost was
knocked out of commission by all the texts that I've got and the texts that I have received.
So I just wanted to say thank you to all of you, I'm sad that I have lost one of the most
important members of my family and I will miss her dearly. But I'm so thankful for the
family I have and all of you and just want to express my appreciation to all of you.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield well. Chair recognizes Representative Cameron for
a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I rise today to remember, a great member of the Rossville Georgia community, who passed
away suddenly yesterday, Carthell Rodgers.
Mr. Rodgers was a member of the Walker County School Board, having been recently appointed
to fill vacancy.
He also was director of the Recreation Center at Rossville, Georgia, but his most important
role was the years and years he invested in the lives of people and the young people
of Rossville, Georgia, helping provide recreational programs for young people disadvantaged and
promoting their growth into adulthood. He was, uh, got to run our parade this year in
Ralsifull. He was doing something all the time to help other people. He was a great neighbor
and a great friend to all of us. He leaves a big hole in her heart, so it will never be filled.
So I'd like to, uh, ask for a moment of silence in his honor.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well.
Well, Chair recognizes Representative Jasmine Clark for a morning order.
Good morning, colleagues.
It is with a heavy heart that we bring news of the passing of Alexander Morales.
Alexandra Morales was a teacher at Benefil Elementary in Lawrenceville, where she served
as a teacher since 2019.
Along with being a beloved member of the faculty, Ms. Morales was the epitome of inclusion
and a beacon of representation as a bilingual teacher that truly connected with many students
in which English was not their first language.
In October of this year, she took a scheduled leave and unfortunately did not return.
After being reported missing by her family, her story came to a tragic end when her body
was found.
The tragic death of Miss Morales leaves a big gaping hole in the heart of the Benefield
Elementary family along with all that loved her.
Today we offer condolences to those touched by this tragedy and ask that you take a moment
of silence in her honor.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes the dean of this house, Dean Smirie, and representative Duke's for
a morning order.
Good morning, thank you, Mrs. Speaker.
Representative Smire and myself come forth today,
because 110 years ago, on the campus of Howard University
in Thurgood Hall, a group of young men,
a great love, Oscar J. Cooper, Frank Coleman,
along with the faculty advisor,
started with many feel is the greatest organization
known to the history of the world.
That being the Omega-Sythe opportunity, we would like for you to join us in celebrating
and acknowledging this moment.
Thank you, Mrs. Speaker.
Chair recognizes Chairman Mayfeeck for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and good morning, everybody.
Today, what a perfect day to get this book, Chairman England.
I don't see you now, but anyways, everybody should have gotten this book on their desk
in their offices, representative Clint Crow, David Knight,
Susan Holmes, and Beth Campani gifted each of you
defying the odds.
Our pastor, Benny Tate, wrote that in many of you
have heard him here in the chamber.
It's an inspirational book of Dr. Tate's personal testimony
of how God guided him through a number of obstacles,
providing him the strength he needed.
Dr. Tate serves as the pastor at Rock Springs Church
in Melner, Georgia, and he and his congregation
pray for us daily.
Thank you, and I hope you enjoy the book.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes representative Hugley
for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We'd like for all of those who are members of
Panellinic organizations to stand with us at this time. If you are a member of
a Panellinic organization, please stand. Today, as been noted, an organization
celebrates and a Founder's Day, the Omega-Sy-5 fraternity Incorporated.
November of the 17th, 1911, this organization was founded on the principles of
manhood, scholarship, perseverance, and uplift. There are many famous men and great
men that belong to Omega. You've seen two of them this morning, but I want to
give a shout out to another great man of Omega. His name is Isaiah Hucley. So 110
years later, these men believe that friendship is essential to the soul.
Congratulations to all the men of Omega today.
Chair recognizes representative Wynn for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today, Georgia and communities across our country
we will celebrate and highlight the important roles
that education support professionals play
in our public schools.
These are the people who drive our children to school
and serve our kids breakfast and lunch.
ESP professionals are also administrative support staff,
custodians, peer reform professionals,
school safety officers,
and other non-teaching education members
in our public schools.
ESP Day is part of National Education Week, starting from November 15th to November 19th,
which celebrates excellence in public schools.
And we know now more than ever, especially under the COVID-19 pandemic, that these education
professionals are essential to the well-being of our Georgia children.
So today, from the Georgia General Assembly, I'd like to thank ESP Professional Support
staff and acknowledge their expertise and their hard work in keeping our children safe,
greeting them from the first moment they walk into the classroom and getting them home safely
at the end of the day. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you Mr. Speaker, we have stood so many times during morning orders during the special
session to honor members of our community who have passed into eternity including
slain police officers. Did you know that it is more likely for a firefighter or law enforcement
personnel to die by suicide than it is in the line of duty? It takes a psychological toll
on our first responders, the work that they do every day. As a matter of fact, with all
of our first responders, there is an exponential likelihood that they will experience PTSD and
other forms of psychological injury while doing their important work. I think many of us
are aware of the work ahead of us to improve mental health and behavioral health outcomes.
There's a lot of heavy lifting we need to do as a body because there's so many of these
issues, mental and behavioral health that affects so many of our Georgia citizens. Now look
forward in this upcoming session for us working together to move the needle in some significant
and meaningful ways.
If you'd like to be a part of the mental health caucus,
please see me or Chairman Todd Jones.
Thank you.
