It is a chair's intention not to be here at end of the night But we will have a fairly full day Because today is crossover eve We will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chapel and after which we will pledge allegiance to the Flag of our country our Chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 68th House District Chairman Jay Collins chairman Collins Thank you mr. Speaker members of the house. I come before you today to present the pastor of the day my pastor Reverend wit Martin Ritt wit is the pastor of the first method of church there in Villa Rica he came to us in the early part of January right before the pandemic yet We were just getting to know him when we had to all go into quarantine and we shut down some of the activities of the church So we're looking forward to as we get through this pandemic to be able to get to know wit and his family a little more He's been a real blessing to us. He came to us from the first method of church over in Smurna His wife Ashley she works for the Carroll County School system there in the in House District 68 They have two children Laney and Maggie who attend the Ithaca Elementary School with my little JJ So we see this family quite often in our community now look forward to the message that he brings I love the fact that at the first method of church in Villa Rica We're not a real big church But we're a big tent church and I appreciate the fact that he He shepherds the flock very well He's always open and welcoming to new parishioners and getting to know folks out in our community He leads us with a with a passion For the Lord and it's just a real blessing anytime I get to be around him Unfortunately we're around each other a lot because of the nature of my chosen profession of funeral service But it's good to fellowship with him and this morning on the way in we got we got sidetracked because of about an hour and a half Fourth of traffic and I called him just to check on him to see where he was and we wound up talking for about 45 minutes on the phone And that was a real blessing to us. So we had a few come bring the word to us this morning. I'm looking forward to it Well good morning It is an honor to be here speaker Ralston to friend and representative Jay Collins to the distinguished members of this house Thank you very much for the opportunity That's a stand here this morning. I want to begin with some scripture Second Kings Chapter six some of you might be one or second Kings But second Kings chapter six. This is one of my favorite scriptures You might see why I hope As we go into the business that you have before you today as you Anticipate this weekend as you anticipate Monday. I hope that this brings encouragement to you I hope that this can bring perspective So let me read this for us this morning second Kings chapter six just just seven verses here here this reading The company of the prophets said to Elisha look the place where we meet with you is too small for us Let us go to the Jordan where each of us can get a pole and let us build a place there for us to meet And he said go Then one of them said won't you please come with your servants? I will the light should reply and he went with them They went to the Jordan and began to cut down trees as one of them was cutting down a tree the iron axe head fell into the water Oh, no my lord. He cried out. It was borrowed The man of God asked where did it fall? When he showed him where the place was Elisha cut a stick and threw it in there and made the iron float Lifted out he said then the man reached out his hand and took it God does not care Is what I told my wife in a particular aisle of a Walmart? We were arguing over a gift that she was looking for for her daddy She wanted to find something that she knew that he would like and so she was combing the aisles Frantically and you can imagine the look on a daughter's face as she's in sort of that 11th hour looking looking looking Trying to find that gift to bless her daddy. She loves him very much And she turned and she looked at me and she said it's got to be here somewhere We need to pray about this And I looked at her and I said sweetie God doesn't care That was the wrong comment And she stopped right there in the aisle of the Walmart and she grabbed my hands And she lifted up a prayer something to akin to Lord Help me bless my daddy If it's here Lord let me find it She said amen and I don't even know if I close my eyes I looked up on the same shelf there's about five tiers of shelves in this aisle They told us that the the present we were looking for was there She was frantically looking but I looked up after that prayer and lo and behold there it was And I didn't say word And she looks up because she sees me looking at the top And then she blames her eyes on it and when she does she turns she looked at me and she said you see God does care What in the world does this passage and second kings have to do really with anything The the context of what's happening in this particular scripture the context and history In second kings there's nations at war with one another there's Politics going on where there's division and and people aren't getting along and one kingdom's talking to the other one party to the other It's back and forth back and forth and and kings are vying for control and all of a sudden there's war and famine one upmanship and then there's this text about a prophet who takes a break From the giving of wisdom and leading and Delivering the word of God and the word of God comes just as powerfully as it would come Any other time to any other situation it comes to a man who borrowed a yard tool And he loses that tool He cries out to God in the midst of losing that tool that insignificant Doesn't mean anything Tool that he borrowed from a buddy And he says Lord He was borrowed He's worried about not being able to return to his neighbor the thing that he had borrowed in this moment the man of God the prophet A great man of great power and great influence looked into a seemingly insignificant moment And performed a mighty miracle Might because I don't know the last time y'all made iron flu But on this day it happened I say this to you today To remind you in the midst of all the goings on that you have on your shoulders And I know your shoulders are tired I know your legs are tired. I know your brains hurt right now But turn to the little things Because for each of us we need to remember in the midst of all of the goings on and all of the things that are happening in your lives right now and our lives right now God does care And he cares about the little things And he cares about the little people and he cares about the little moments I challenge you today I steal some of those little moments Cry out to God in the midst of things that seem insignificant that you would quite honestly go I'm not praying about that. God's got bigger things to do. He's keeping the universe from crashing in and no No, he is keeping things going But he's also very close For the man of God walks among each of us even in the midst of us losing something seemingly insignificant And he will find it if we will call upon him nothing is too small For God I hope that that will encourage you today as you have the opportunity Not that you need to step away from everything for you have great responsibility on you right now I understand But take a deep breath Know that you are being prayed for by many especially in this great great state we call Georgia Know that you are not alone and know that the little things matter And believe it or not we know that they matter to you too and so lean into yourselves today This weekend Monday Lean into yourselves and even in the little things Cry out to God because he does care. Amen Will you pray with me God we look at the things going on in our lives and sometimes the insignificant type things come and we wonder How does this fit? I got stuff to do. There's things going on I have to get this done and I got to do that It isn't it interesting how you oh lord re-orey and us and you You laser focus in on things that at first we dismiss and we think that they're just too small and then there you are right in the midst of the small things God guide this blessed body through their work and the big things But call their hearts lord to the small things and speak loudly lord Shake them and raise them up and courage them And may they know that you Jesus walk among them in the big and in the small for you O Lord you do care What's in your precious name we pray Amen You'll now turn for the pledge of allegiance I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic We should stand one nation under God and the visible with liberty and justice for all You Doorkeepers will unlock the doors You Chair recognizes chairman hogan the chair of the committee on information and audits Thank You mr Speaker your committee on information and audits has read the journal of the previous Legislative day and found it to be correct and furthermore mr.

Mr. Speaker, isn't this simply a procedural vote that allowed the author to continue having conversations with members about ways that we could possibly improve this measure? I think that is an accurate statement. All right, I'm going to do one more of what purpose does leader Beverly rise? We're speaking of move to object to this reconsideration. Well, I think the proper form of an objection would be to vote no on his motion. On the gentleman's motion that the House reconsider its action in failing to give House bill 435 a requisite majority. All those in favor of reconsideration will vote aye those opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. The effect of the reconsideration if it is approved would be to return the bill to the general calendar. Those in favor of reconsideration will vote aye those opposed to vote no. Members who are at their seats, I would remind that the rules of the House are required that you vote one way or the other. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the gentleman's motion. The eyes are 93. The nays are 67. The motion carries and the House is reconsidered its action. This bill will now go back to the general calendar. Going on now to morning orders. Going on to morning orders. House will come to order. House will come to order. Okay, going on to morning orders. Ten minutes total time. Chair recognizes Chairman Robert Dickie for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would like to thank the members and members. I come this morning to ask you to stand to remember a constation on the mind. Jackie Posit bowling passed away after a long fight with cancer. She is currently serving as a city councilman for a small little city that I represent called Cologne. This city was very pertinent this morning. This city has only about less than 200 people. It has a great history, a great tradition, and great people that work very hard. Jackie was one of those people that put her whole life and efforts and time into the little city of Cologne. I just want to remember her this morning and a great lady. So I'll take a moment to remember her. Thank you. Like you. Chair recognizes Chairman Hausten, Chairman Perkel, Chairman Watson, and Representative Meeks for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We come to the world today to recognize and honor the life of Dr. Jay Frank McGill. Dr. McGill was passed away earlier this week. After 52 years of his involvement in the peanut and industry, he was one of those as a county agent. 16 years as a full time consultant at Eminem Mars over and all many. He then served another five years as a consultant to the USDA's national peanut lab in Dawson. Dr. McGill probably had some of the greatest influences on the peanut industry in our state when he was in an extension office in 1954 to 1982. He was part of the peanut production team that helped raise the yield of peanuts from the 955 pounds to more than 3,220 pounds in 1974. Dr. McGill's work took him to 21 countries on four continents. We have been introduced into the peanut Hall of Fame, received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Peanut Council in 1999. And that year, ladies and gentlemen, as you may remember from a resolution we passed last year, the American Peanut Council officially named Mr. McGill, Mr. Peanut. Ladies and gentlemen, we take this opportunity to observe a few moments of silence for Dr. McGill, the one who has had a great impact on the peanut industry in the state of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes Representative Eric Atomis for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today to pay homage to one of our members of our leadership team. She doesn't even know why she's standing here today. But we are here to pay homage to her and her father that passed away a few weeks ago. And even though our funeral caucus member, Representative Patty Billy couldn't be here today, but she did help us to get this blanket made. And I just want to show it. Thank you so much. And we love you, Treasurer Robachoff. Chair recognizes Representative Mallow for a morning order. Chair recognizes Representative Mallow for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, today I rise to pay homage to the largest slave sale in Georgia history. This would take place on March 2nd through the 3rd, 1859 at the 10 Brock Racecourse, one-fourth of the mile away from Otis Brock Elementary School in Savannah, Georgia, to satisfy his creditors, Pierce M. Butler, Sold, 436 men, women, and children from his Butler Island and Hampton plantations near Darian, Georgia. The breakup of families and the loss of home became known in African American history and American heritage as remember the weeping time. This event was reported extensively in the Northern Press and reaction to the sale deepened the nation's growing sectional divide in the years immediately preceding the Civil War. I would ask my colleagues to rise for a moment of silence honoring those 436 men, women, and children that were sold on the 10 Brock Racecourse known as the weeping time. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes Chairman Heath Clark for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Throughout human history, there has been a common denominator in our existence. Whether it's our founders sitting around and stoking the flames of liberty, leaders of the Reformation discussing theology and change, legendary authors having a book club that led to masterpieces in literature. That common denominator has been locally made craft beer. Serve to locals at pubs and taverns. Tomorrow, March 6th is Georgia craft beer day. In Georgia, there's over 100 breweries that contribute $1.8 billion in economic impact. Over 12,000 jobs. And in many of our communities in our local area that drives tourism and economic development across our state. As one of our founders said, beer is evidence that God loves us and wants us to be happy. So tomorrow, go out and support your local breweries on March 6th. Thank you. Chair recognizes Representative Kinard for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. When I read the Gospels, I noticed that Christ was a bridge builder and affirmed people of other faith traditions. He taught parables that featured Samaritans. He took note of the great faith of the Roman centurion who was a polytheist. It's interesting to me that Jesus' birth location was discovered by Magi, Eastern Mystics, who through their astrology found the Christ. Jesus said that there is a time coming and now is when we will not worship at this or that mountain, but in spirit and in truth. It is in this spirit that I bring House Resolution 259, which recognizes the Holy Month of Ramadan and other holy days of Islam, a faith in the Abrahamic tradition. There are two billion Muslims worldwide, three and a half million in the US, and over 200,000 in Georgia. On behalf of our state house, we recognize the contributions made by Muslim Georgians, which are many, and have added such value to our state. If you can't see God in all, you can't see God at all. I still have a link. I yield the will. Chair recognizes Representative McLeod for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Big up to my colleagues. During our debate on HB531, one of my Republican colleagues commented that we were complaining that HB531 was rooted in Jim Crow laws, and proceeded to say the Democratic Party was the Party of Jim Crow. Yes, the Republican Party was the Party of Choice for most African Americans. After the Republican Party President Lincoln basically freed the slaves, both Black men and Black women, what my Republican colleague failed to say is that political parties are built on ideas and policies. After 1965, Black people left the Republican Party in droves because the Republican Party at hoping up its doors to white supremacy. And that the Democratic Party at hoping up its doors to be inclusive, welcoming everyone onto the Big Tent. I hope I have cleared up this matter. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the will. We're going on now to the rules calendar. We're going on to the rules calendar. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 81. House Bill 81, where we're going to be. We're all still in the seventh. Jones, the 47th burns, the 559th thing, the 116th, will be taught on an act to make and provide appropriations. This is the last year of the year, beginning July 1st, 2021, and ending June 30th, 2022, this bill I'm referring to, the Committee on Appropriations. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by Committee substitute. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, the chair now resolves the House into a Committee of the Whole House for the purpose of considering House Bill 81, the General Appropriations Bill. The chair appoints the gentleman from the 159th District, the majority leader of the House, leader burns as chairman to preside over the Committee of the Whole House. You have a good morning. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from the 116th House District, representative England, to present the bill. Chairman England. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, everyone. Y'all not very awake for a Friday morning. Good morning. All right. That's a little better. Good to be in front of y'all today with one of the most important pieces of business that we do on a yearly basis, of course, and that is the budget for the upcoming fiscal year. As always, there are an awful lot of thank yous to end out. Our first biggest thank you, of course, goes to the folks that help us make this possible. And that's House Budget Research Office. Martha Wiggin and Christine Murdoch and our team over in the LOB doing an incredible job day in and day out, 365 days a year. A lot of folks think that all of us are only here 40 days, but I'll tell you that the budget process is something that runs 365 days of the year. And Martha and Christine and their team are certainly the ones that make that happen. Our subcommittee chairs and our subcommittees and the members in general of the Appropriations Committee put an awful lot of work into this budget this year. Probably since last June with the cycle that went through in June with the pandemic budget and then coming into this budget, certainly within my 11 years, are probably the most in depth work we've done on our state budget. Preparing for the economy to fall out from undress as it certainly looked and appeared like it would back in June to today when we see things have somewhat stabilized but realize that there are still storm waves on the horizon in front of us. So in doing so, we have done what we've always done in this state. No matter the party crafted a very conservative budget that looks after those that send us here, our constituents. Looks after our constituents, looks after our families, looks after the folks that we set aside in church on Sundays that were in Sunday school with those are the folks that were charged with looking after. And I think you'll find in this budget that that is certainly the case. One of the little shout out real quick. I know I kind of made a big deal about it when we were working on the amended budget but I want to again because all of our committees have been using.

Zoom and all of those type platforms to hold our meetings and live streaming. But again, my thank you personally goes out to Betsy and her team with house media services. They have done an incredible job. I know that all of you have been on a Zoom meeting or two dozen or three dozen over the last several weeks and it my hat goes off to Betsy and her team and the incredible job that they have done. The budget in front of you is 27.2 billion dollars which is up about 5.2% over the FY21 budget. As always, budgets do have a dominant theme that reflects public opinion. However house bill 81 has adjustments in just about every area of the budget this year. In fact, there are only 12 different sections that have no changes which is highly unusual. But if you think about in those areas with the exception of two or three of those, we have made adjustments in those particular areas over the last couple of years already. Comprehensive is the theme of this budget and as we walk through it, you'll kind of understand what I'm talking about. We start off by annualizing things that we did in the amended budget. A full year of funding for 16 crisis bids for behavioral health. It's $7 million. $20.7 million for the second year of the Georgia Outdoor Stewardship Program. $39 million, $Farce Land Protection Grants. $35 million in the Integic Care Trust Fund for dish payments for disproportionate share hospitals. This is something we've always been in a rears on that and the Farce Land Protection. We're actually catching those up and putting it in the base to get ahead of that going forward. That's important to your local governments and to your local school systems on the disport, excuse me, on the Farce Land Protection Grants, but it's also on the dish payments important to your small local hospitals. Our libraries. If you remember in our libraries, we did in the amended budget a temporary bump from $0.35 per capita to $0.40, we're annualizing that here in this budget. Pre-senior level critical staff positions for public health, something that we added in the amended budget, and also funding the chief labor officer. Not surprisingly, reinvestments in education and health continue to reflect our ongoing priorities for our new dollars. For the onset of the education experience, there's 3.5 million in the Child Care Pererent Services or CAHPS program for 625 more slots and a 2.5 percent increase in the pre-K operating budget for the classrooms. 60 percent restorations to QBE of $567 million and another roughly $8 million going into other direct instructional programs. In higher education, about $138 million there and 60 percent restorations in the B units that deal with direct instruction as well. Altogether, $756 million are $56.4 percent of the new dollars are going into education. In addition to appropriating 32 percent of all new revenues into health and human service areas, we utilize the enhanced federal matching rate or the EF map during the COVID-19 crisis and knowing that it's going to continue on for a little bit longer, we have done the same here. $7.5 million goes to the support the oversight of long-term care facilities. $56.7 million for reimbursement rate increases for primary care providers and OBGYNs across our state. That number also includes $12.3 million for those professionals caring for persons with intellectual and or developmental disabilities. DBHD has over 700 partners who provide services to folks in our districts. It touches every one of our districts. I promise you. In this budget, I also include $24 million to expand our offerings and the infrastructure to those in need, especially during these stressful times. Just a note, between the governor's recommendation and the House additions, we're putting $58 million additional dollars into behavioral health in this budget. $36 million of that was added by this House, Chair Lady Dempsey and her subcommittee. Infrastructure and government is too bold. One part composed of systems of delivery and the others composed of people who do the delivery. With that in mind, our subcommittees identified several groups of state employees where salary adjustments were and are needed. Food inspectors, drivers license, examiners, banking examiners, medical examiners, state troopers, district attorneys and prosecuting attorneys for an example. $4 million in targeted recruitment and retention in those areas. We funded the infrastructure needs for legislative initiatives, including the vaping bill that we passed last year, Hempagra Culture, Medical Cannabis Production and a strong independent ethics commission. House Bill 81 fully funds the cost and support positions associated with the four new judge ships. We recognize $7.5 million in new rideshare fees to build out transit projects, $1.96 billion in motor fuel funds and $100 million in road and bridge bonds and $10 million for our short-line railroads that our state own railroads. In the infrastructure, for our future includes $10 million in broadband grants, $102 million in convention center space for getting ready for the rebound in this economy and $39.5 million in the governor's recommendation for the rural innovation fund. Again, your peers in this body have gone through this budget many times over the last several weeks and quite frankly, most of the members have gone through this budget many times over the last several months. So we'll run through the tracking sheet that you have in front of you and talk about some of those particular things. I mentioned there were 12 places that there were no changes. One of those we start out with with the Georgia Senate. Chairman Watson in subcommittee thought long and hard about the total elimination there but decided otherwise that that might kind of upset the apple cart so you'll see there are no changes there. Now we're supposed to laugh about that. Section two, the Georgia House of Representatives, you'll see an ad back there at 2.1.1 as it relates to the restoration of member salaries. We, like all other state agencies last year, took a 10% reduction. We took that from our annual salary that is being restored but it also provides funds going forward into the reapportionment session that we'll have later this year. Section three, joint offices of the General Assembly. At 3.1.1 you'll see an ad that goes through in several other places. I'll mention it here and not as we go forward. Then we'll teach you retirement systems. So there is a slight uptick in the cost to the state on it from 19.06 to 19.81 so you'll see the adjustment there. You'll also see it scattered through DJJ and Department of Education and a couple of other places as well. 3.1.2, the restoration of funds for legislative operations, 1.3 deals with legal representation for the upcoming reapportionment session, and then restorations at 2.1 and 3.1 as well to backfill where we had to take cuts in the 21 budget. Section four, audits and accounts. At 4.1.2 you'll see some additions there. The first one deals with looking at our tax credit programs that we do in the state that have been incredibly successful. But we also feel that once in a while you need to go back and look at them and make sure they're being successful as they were intended to be as we think they are. So what this does is allow for the auditor to have enough staff on hand to do up to five examinations at the request of our ways of means chairman or the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee on the Senate side and that's five per chairman there. 1.3 deals with additional auditors needed for the coronavirus pandemic funding and audit trail there. And then 1.4 deals with some software upgrades that are needed as well. And you'll see there are several times through the document that we have software upgrades built in. These systems continue to change that as a necessity especially for state government and helping to prevent cyber attacks. Looking on the court of appeal section five, again a software upgrade at 1.5 at 1.8 the funding for a temporary judge where one of those judges is currently not able to serve on the bench. 1.9 and 2.6 restorations of reductions taken in FY21. 6 judicial counsel 6.4.5 as a software upgrade and some new equipment for the Georgia courts register our system which will help connect all of the court systems together in the state. We started that back in the amended budget and then at 6.4.6 matching funds for federal grant there. And then at 6.5.2 again some restoration of personal services that were from the 21 reductions. Under juvenile courts section seven you'll see at 7.1.1 we're saying no to that item at this time that position is currently in the Department of juvenile justice and funded with federal funds. Then at 7.2.2 and 7.2.3 you'll see the reference to some additions made for new judge ships. Section 8 prosecuting attorney's counsel. They 0.2 they had requested 12 additional assistant DA's the public safety committee with Chairman Hitchens said no we need to keep parity there between those and the public defenders. So you'll see we're doing seven there and then when you get over to the public defenders you'll see we're adding five are the balance of those positions there in public defenders. At 2.5 you'll see an adjustment for staff retention I mentioned in my opening comments. 2.6 2.7 2.8 and 2.9 relate to the new judge ships. At 8.3.3 again dealing with their training for the prosecuting attorney's counsel they're finding that their training is going very well. Now they've kind of pick back up operation but it's going very well virtually and so we're just encouraging them to stay with the virtual program presentation instead of spending dollars on a lot of travel. Under Supreme Court section 9 you'll see a restoration there of some of the reductions that we had to make in F.O.21. 3.10 you'll see the transfer from the Augusta Circuit to the newly created Columbia Circuit. On Supreme Court section 10 10.1.7 restoration of the 21 cuts and then at 1.8 providing for a new IT support position that position will also be shared with the business court that we stood up last year. State accounting office section 11 down under attached agency 11.5.1 you'll see the addition of some staffing needs that they had a request for. One senior auditor, junior auditor, junior attorney, financial assistant and an IT position there and then at 5.2 some one time expenses for an e-filing system upgrade. Section 12 Department of Administrative Services I think on the calendar from Monday is the consideration of four compensation resolutions. Should those receive final passage through the House and the Senate then we'll either if that is done before we finish our work here we will fund those here or either in the amended budget when we come back next year. Section 12 Administrative Services no changes. Section 13 Department of Ag. Again in my opening comments I mentioned the Georgia Hemp program is one of those that we're getting fully stood up so we're analyzing what we had started in the F.O. Ended FY21 budget there at 2.3 again looking at those critical positions those food safety inspectors that that work out of the Department of Ag that we all count on working to help retain those individuals instead of having such a high turnover rate. 2.4 with the passage of House Bill 1057 last year requires the Department to have a sole scientist and a compliant specialist so we're funding that here. 13.4.2 as the gate program the Georgia Agricultural Tax Exemption Program is set up the funds that come in for men are to be turned around and used back in the administration of that fund. So what you see here is an adjustment for that but also naming the market bullets and the farmers and consumers market bullets and that many of us receive every week or so as it to be the official communications and compliance article for the gate program. And at 4.3 as it relates to the farmers markets at Thomasville Cordell and Savannah to retain some funds that we put in last year for the operation of those markets. Continuing on under the attached agencies there under the Ag Exposition Authority are the Georgia National Fairgrounds Restoration of the 21 cut that we made there if 10%. Under the Georgia Development Authority as we met here in special session after Hurricane Michael came through we had done two things there with the Department of the Georgia Development Authority and one of those was a bridge loan program the other one was the forest recovery grants that we had put in place. All of those grants have been applied far and out the door and are paid and they have about $7.8 million remaining there and what we're seeing here is just giving them the authorization to put it into the revolving loan fund to make ag loans across the state. 13.8.1 under the Solar Water Conservation Commission providing funds for one rule water specialist. Banking and finance section 14, 14.2.1. When addressing those critical positions will high turnover rates this will provide a 6% salary adjustment to 49 examiners. Those examiners do an incredible job and what we found that for every dollar that we spend with them there's about a $2 return on that investment so we want to make sure that we hang on to those individuals because it does take some time for them to understand what they're doing and fully get up to speed. And then you'll see the same at 14.3.2. Section 15, this section right here as it relates to Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities while there's a lot of impact being made throughout this budget. This is probably one of the most impactful sections of the budget this year. A lot of what's being done here is in recognition of the work from the Mental Health Commission but a lot of it is also looking at what the existing and ongoing needs are at DBHDD. So if you look at 15.1.1 you'll see a restoration there 125,000 for the Hepatitis C project. At 1.2 you'll see an addition of $2.7 million that goes directly to core services. There'll be 11 providers that will be impacted by the parity that this adjustment will allow for. Looking at 2.5 you'll also see what I mentioned in my opening comment about the 16-bed center that we opened in the amended budget and that's annualizing those dollars. 5% rate increase for the IDD providers at 2.6. 2.7 again one of those core services as it relates to non-waver services and family support of 4.6 million. 2.8 and 2.9 two different language items. One dealing with the Appendix K waiver application that is in that will allow for quite a few adjustments to be made to a lot of our providers across the state. And these include community residential alternative treatment, community living support, community access for individuals and group day services there. 15.2.9. I know many of you have probably heard from constituents that there are some rule changes being proposed up to CMS from DBXDD as it relates to those individuals that are homebound and require 24 hour they care. What we're saying here is the general symbol is intent is for those 188 individuals that are currently in that program to continue to be cared for. After adult forensic services at 15.3.3 you'll see the addition for six forensic peer mentors at 15.4. Continuing to stand up what will be a federal requirement for each state to have an existing 9.8.8 emergency number for those that are contemplating suicide to have that stood up and all the background stuff be there. Individuals, the counselors those that can walk people through and get them out of crisis stage. I will tell you that we are leading the way in Georgia on this particular program through the work of chair lady Dempsey and her committee over the last several years. We have already taken a lot of the steps that are required. So we're a little ahead of the game on that and I'm thankful for it. In 15.4.5 you'll see an addition of $177,000 there for those issues related to suicide because of the COVID-19 pandemic but also the addition of one suicide epidemiologist. At 4.6 again an addition of 6.4 million that goes directly to core services and here about 12 different providers across the state will benefit from that are an additional 5,226 individuals per year will receive services. 15.8.1 if you'll recall about two years ago we stood up the apex program on a statewide basis. We've done it as a pilot program for several years. I think Chairman Nix's county school system had been doing it as one of the pilots. It had proven very successful. We expanded that statewide two years ago. We're doing a further expansion to get into more schools. I think it'll be 50 some odd schools that will help this $2 million ad will help get us into with that. Then at 8.2 some additional training for people within the schools to understand how to deal with young people that are having suicidal tendencies or thoughts. Moving on to Department of Community Affairs in section 16 under the Special Housing Initiative at 16.9.1 you'll see an addition there for behavioral health coach. We'll start that out in the Southern Georgia Regional Commission's area agency on aging. We've got a pretty good idea how it's going to work but we want to make sure that it's going to work the way we think it will before we roll that out statewide. Continuing under DCA you'll see a slight reduction at 16.11.1 in the Reba program. This remains with $10 or $11 million in the base. This is something that's used statewide. We've got a little bit of headroom there right now so we thought we could use those additional state funds in some other areas and some other needs for the time being. 16.15.3 and I'll mention under one Georgia. Again, going back at 16.15.1 you'll see a 39.5 ad there for the rural innovation fund. We've agreed with the governor on that and appreciate the acknowledgement of the work of so many individuals as it relates to rural development. Also at 15.2 $10 million going into the grant fund for broadband expansion there. That 15.3 continuation or an annualization of an ad we made in the amended budget for the grants administrator and to be able to continue to update those maps across the state. In 17 community health again another one of those sections that your subcommittees have done an incredible job chairman parish and all those that serve with him looking into the different things that could be done to continue to help take care of Georgia's. So at 17.1.5 as our state has continued to grow and as federal and state dollars continue to get put into DCH a lot more workload there for their senior level staff. And just as we did in the amended budget for public health we're doing the same here to add two new senior positions as it relates to their admin. I think it would amaze you at how many dollars when you look at the federal dollars that flow through this agency and realize how lean that staff is they need a little more bandwidth and that's what we're trying to help them with. In the past as we were trying to balance budgets in 2011 and 12 one of our favorite places to go was at department admin and take it a little bit more cut a little bit more cut. Well as the state came into recovery and have been going through recovery and continuing to grow the entire whole time it's become necessary to have a little more staff support there. Under healthcare access and improvement at 4.1 you'll see the elimination of one time funds but then the addition of one time funds for two FQHCs one in Jeff Davis County and one in Marion County at 5.2 you'll see the healthcare facility regulation division and add there to help them keep up and maintain with those surveys have to be done in our nursing homes. 17-7 under Medicaid age blind disabled you'll see where we've made the adjustment at 7.4 for the savings on the enhanced FM out going another quarter further and then at 7.8 you'll see a 2% rate increase for our skilled nursing centers 7.9 on adjustment for their liability insurance and at 7.10 something that we have for whatever reason sort of overlooked over the last several years as it relates to those home and community based service providers. Those are the providers that go out into our communities dealing with people that otherwise would be in a nursing home however they're living at home staying with family and this is a much more cost efficient method for us to care for individuals while at the same time being a method in which the individuals feel more comfortable there at home there were relatives and loved ones 24 hours a day but making an adjustment there I think it was 2010 was last time we made an adjustment for those folks 17 8.4 recognition of the EF mount savings moving on down to peach care again you'll see at 9.3 an adjustment for the EF mount savings and then at 17 10.1 in the state of benefit plan a pilot program for opioid drug disposal so when one of our plan members gets a prescription then if they don't use all of that prescription this is actually a really neat bag a little bag that you actually put the drugs in add a little bit of water and within just a matter of 5 10 15 minutes those drugs are neutralized we know we have an opioid epidemic we know we have an issue with family members a lot of time stealing these medications we're going to see if this is something will certainly help us going forward then under graduate medical education at 17.12 at 12.4 you'll see the initial planning work money for the graduate medical education program at the southeast Georgia medical system we've got those spread across the state we still got that little corner down there that we've not done an expansion recently in and that's what we're looking to do there at 17 13 1 that deals with the expansion of Mercer School of Medicine the Columbus campus we started kick that off last year I think they're within about six months of completion of the building and this makes sure that we fill up to or stand up to our obligation to make sure that they're able to put those students through there when it's fully spoolsed up there'll be 240 medical students there when it gets rolling at 17 13 2 I'll mention this here and we won't have to talk about it a whole lot under GBI you'll see some ads as it relates to medical examiners in GBI but also what we have found is that there is a nationwide shortage on medical examiners those individuals that are trained to do all topseys and it's been very acute here in the state of Georgia as it relates to GBI being very short staffed we've got an ad there in GBI that will relate to raising salaries and and also being able to hire some additional individuals there but also working with Mercer School of Medicine Dr. Jean Sumner to stand up a medically examiner forensic pathologist program at Mercer 1100 slides nationwide 600 of those are currently empty you know I think Georgia is a good place to train some good people to go out and help help solve crimes but also help families be able to get some peace of mind as to what's happened to a loved one section 18 Community Supervision no changes section 19 Department of Corrections you'll just see the language here that we had added in the amended budget as it relates to the 10% salary increase utilizing existing funds from vacancies within the Department of Corrections we just annualized that language here memorialized it in this document moving on to section 20 Department of Defense no changes section 21 Department of Driver Services and the committee subcommittees testimony they heard from DDS on the issues they were having on retaining their driver's license examiners these are the individuals that make it possible that that commerce keeps flowing within the state of Georgia that we have a driver's license that our citizens our constituents have driver's licenses they testify that they were actually losing employees to McDonald's because McDonald's was paying better than they were able to so what we're doing here is doing a 5% slightly skew me a 10% salary increase for those individuals on the lower wrong of the pay scale there and the 5% for those that are just above that a little bit 21.2.3 you'll see there the addition for the Georgia ID registration process the speaker had mentioned this in a press conference a couple of days ago about making sure that that IDs were available to all legal Georgia residents and that's what that will help do under decals section 22 you'll see an increase there at the CAPS program to allow for 625 additional slots currently that program serves about 50,000 students across the state or children across the state 23.22.3.3 you'll see a 2.5% increase for our pre-K classroom operations again this is another one of those first time in quite a while since about 2010 and then a pre-K specialist position that we'd intended to do in 21 but couldn't because of the budget cuts section 23 economic development 23.1.1 the addition for some additional rent and then moving on down to 23.5.2 under global commerce an addition of one new project manager position as I think you've heard the governor and others mentioned Georgia has fared very well through COVID with the job announcements that we've had I think our our unemployment numbers being lower than those nationwide also attest to that so we want to make sure that we're doing

We need to be doing there. 23.6.1. We do contract with individuals and countries around the world as it relates to international relations and international trade. They're the ones that are the face of Georgia in contact with many of these companies looking to come to the United States. As operating expenses have gotten higher, everywhere else they have done so worldwide, so it's necessary to make some additions there. Saving is at 23.7.1. And then under tourism, the World Congress Center, as with anything, during COVID, you've seen it have to be shut down. They're finally starting to kind of roll back out and open back up. They've had a couple of fairly decent size events this spring over the last couple of weeks, but they had to furlough and lay off quite a number of folks because of the council shows that they would have normally had. So we're willing to make sure that they've got what they need to get spooled back up, so you'll see a one-time out of about $2.5 million there to help them get back to going. I think they're down right now to nine employees, including Frank Poe and several senior staff. Those individuals have actually been the ones outpushing the brooms and cleaning the restrooms in these events that we've had. They wanted to make sure that the World Congress Center continues to run and continues to operate and that we show that Georgia is open for business. Remember also that the state has an over an $800 million investment in that facility since it was opened in the 1970s. We have put quite a bit of an investment of state taxpayer dollars over there, so it's necessary for it to continue to operate. Moving on to education section 24. Under Ag Education, again, I'll just quickly mention at 1.1, you'll see the adjustment in TRS. I won't mention it again unless by mistake here in a minute. At 24.1.3, you'll see the restoration to extend a day and extended year programs and a 60% restoration to the other programs to bring it to parity with the QBE restoration. And then at 1.4, we had planned to add several young farmer positions last year and the budget, however, as we came back in June, we knew that that hope was lost, but this year we were able to add those and model in Fulton Pickens, where and worth counties. Moving on down to state charter schools at 24.4.3, just adding an additional $1 million to the base for the charter facilities grants. Moving over to curriculum development at 24.6.3, you'll see an ad there of 323,000. That is actually going to show up under Technology and Career Education as a reduction there, we're just changing where that program is. Then looking at 8.4, you'll see a true up. The enrollment there is down somewhat, so we've got a true up there. At 24.10.3, Chairman Jones and his subcommittee and his superintendents in his district are actually kind of brainstorming about an idea of how to get access to STEM and AP STEM courses across the state. They've got a little bit of additional, for lack of a better term bandwidth there, to be able to offer that to some of our rural districts across the state. So they're willing to partner in for Scythe and Cherokee County to help some other districts across the state to give access to children and students to AP STEM. Moving on to non-QBE grants, you'll see an restoration and an ad at 11.2 as it relates to feminine hygiene products that now puts about 1.25 million in the base as it relates to that. And then at 11.3, 11.4 and 11.6, adjustments and recognition of CARES-ACS dollars as it relates to the residential treatment facilities where students are. And what it's doing basically is a net zero. It's just recognizing those federal funds that are backfilling where some of the state funds have been reduced. And then at 11.5, the hiring of a budget analyst and grant manager in that department for these facilities. We have a little bit of a hard time getting correct information as it relates to them. We're wanting to make sure that we kind of solve that issue. Under nutrition at 12.3, you'll see an addition of $5 million there. Again, our cafeteria workers cross the state, one of those that you just don't hear an awful lot about. But during this pandemic, have done an incredible job of getting meals out to students. As schools closed down last spring, what you wound up seeing were the cafeteria workers and the bus drivers and other members of faculty at our school systems, making sure that children were fed during the week. And so we're just wanting to recognize that, but also add back there where we've had to make reductions in the past. Under preschool disabilities, again, a true up at 24, 13, 2, true up at 14, 1, a true up at 15, 1, true up at 16, 1. And then under QBE, the changes there all relate to formula true ups. But also, if you'll note at 17, 2, and 17, 3, when you add, subtract all those numbers together at net south to a zero, but they're under only under one particular line in the QBE formula. So we've just cleaned that up. 17, 7, again, relates to a formula true up, 18, 2, the formula true up again. Under the State Charter Schools Commission, under their admin, they are allowed per code to reserve up to 3% of their earnings. So we're just recognizing kind of lifting that base there for them. Under technology and career education, at 22.3, again, fully funding extended day, extended year for those teachers and a 60% restoration of other services contained within that line item. And then at 22.4, you'll see the move that I mentioned earlier under curriculum development. Moving on to section 25, ERS. Again, thinking about those cafeteria workers and the bus drivers, custodians that have had to continue to work and just kind of a hat tip to them for the incredible job that they have done. So 25.3.2, you'll see a slight bump in the PSERS multiplier from 15, 50 to 15, 75 per year service. Under 25.4.1, we're asking the Board of Trustees of the ERS system to consider a benefit adjustment for our retired state employees, or even a 13th benefit check like we've done in a few of the previous years recently. State Farster Commission, section 26. You'll see adjustments made there for the workers compensation benefit increase, the premium increase there on four different items. Section 27, Office of the Governor. An adjustment on the Governor's emergency fund, we had put a $10 million additional dollars in there last year for the pandemic response, not knowing exactly what would be needed. We're bringing that back down to its kind of traditional level of just a little over $11 million. We still have a lot of flexibility within the CARES Act dollars for any of those emergencies that might normally be something that would need the emergency fund to be used for. We always have the option as well to come back in the amended budget and add money there. We'll make a side note also that, remember in the amended budget, currently that fund sets at about $25 million. We did want to make sure that there was adequate dollars there in case of an active spring storm season. To meet any needs that might arise. Under the Professional Standards Commission down at 27.6.3, you'll see increase in personal services for the program needs as it relates to the ethics division and educator preparedness division. And then at 27.6.4, the continuation of the troops to teachers program, federal program that had been in place and the feds have decided to quit funding. However, it has been incredibly, incredibly successful in the state of Georgia. And we want to see that to continue on. 27.7.2, basically a language item just spelling out where the dollars are to be spent. 7.3 is an adjustment for the growing readers program, another very successful program. And then the 7.4 is the Governor's School Leadership Academy for school superintendents and principals who have been able to come to. It has been very successful. Retiring, I guess retiring, is not seeking a contract renewal, Alvin Wilbanks and Gwinnick County. That was one of his ideas several years ago and it has been incredibly successful. We want to make sure that it continues. And then under the office of the state inspector general at 9.1, allowing them to have a vehicle, they've been actually having to rent a vehicle to travel across the state over the last several years on doing their investigations. And we just felt like it was a better, better to purchase a vehicle than to lease the vehicle and totally be out of any capital investment there. 28.5.1 under human services. You'll see an increase there to restore part of the cut that was taken. As we were here in the FY21 for the multi agency alliance for children. I think that's all the services under DHS. Moving on to section 29, Office of the Insurance Commissioner. Under fire safety at 29.3.3, the addition of two building inspectors to be able to continue our economic development across the state, making sure that we're getting timely investigations or inspections done there. Under GBI section 30, I mentioned earlier the forensic scientific services and the issues that we've been running into. What you find here is the annualization of the adjustment that we started in the amended budget. 30.4.2, you'll see the annualization of some sworn positions that were added in 21. Then moving on down to CJCC, you'll see a reduction there under the law enforcement training program. There's 15 million there in the current year's budget actually. Those dollars have not been expended yet. We're still living five million in the base. As that program gets stood up and then actually operating and running, we will then come back and fund it as needed going forward. Under family violence at 30.7, you'll see a 2% rate increase for our domestic violence shelters, as well as some additional dollars to stand up to new domestic violence shelters that were partially funded in 2020. Juvenile justice, no changes. Department of Labor at 32.2.1, you'll see the beginning of the annualization of the chief labor officer position there that was added in the amended budget. Department of Law, no changes. Section 33, section 34, DNR. Again, no changes there. Section 35, if I can get my papers to come apart. Parns and peroles, no changes. State properties, no changes. Under section 36. Section 37, the Public Defender Council of Georgia. Again, the adjustments for the new judicial circuits. And then also the five juvenile assistant public defenders that I mentioned when we were talking about that, assisted DAs earlier, 37.2.5. 2.6 and adjustment for leave payouts to make sure that as someone leaves, as they have to get paid out on vacation in sick time, that they're not having to hold those positions vacant until those dollars are paid out, they can actually do those payouts and turn around and hire someone back very quickly. 37.2.7, again, the retention adjustments that I had mentioned in my opening comments as well. Moving on, section 38, Public Health. As it relates to adolescent and adult health programs, at 38.1.1, any restoration of some of the funding to the Georgia Core Program, at 38.1.2, the restoration of the cut from FY21 to the Sickle Cell Program, along with part of their requests for additional funds. And I'll also mention those of you that were in committee yesterday, saw it and heard it, but you'll also see an ad as it relates to Sickle Cell under the Georgia Research Alliance. 38.1.3, the addition of 200,000 for feminine hygiene. Under 38.3.2, the positions that we had added in the amended budget, just annualizing those salaries there. At 38.5.1 under epidemiology, just the ongoing expenses of new vaccine management system at 1.5 million there. All the changes in public health. So under public safety, Chairman Hitchens and his committee looked at several things that, again, dealing with retention issues. And as we see our state troopers out there on the road, day in and day out, many of those individuals have been with the agency for 10, 20, even 30 years. But once they hit about eight years, they see no more salary increase. And so what we're doing here is going in and creating a two-step retention model there. It'll be a 2.5% bump for a senior trooper with 12 to 19 years of experience and a 5% master trooper category for those with 20 plus years of experience. And you'll see that under aviation, capital police, field offices, and motor carrier compliance. And you'll also see a reduction of the ad at 39.4.1 for the trooper schools. That leaves about 12.3 million in the base. They'll plan on getting at least three trooper schools done this year, maybe more. And then you'll see at 4.3 and at 5.3, the recognition of utilizing some existing funds for some bond projects that they had requested, cash funding them instead of doing those with bonds. Moving on down to Georgia Firefighters Standards and Training Council at 39.7.1. Again, about 70% of the firefighters state water volunteers. These are people just like us. They're part-time firefighter but full-time something else. And to ask them to come to the required training at Gypsy, take three, four days off for a job that they don't get paid with, just paid for to start with, isn't quite fair. So what we're doing is standing up a virtual training program that they can use there. At 8.2, you'll see a software upgrade and at 10.1 also software upgrades. Section 40 under Commission Administration at 40.1.1, you'll see an ad there for some one-time legal expenses. Board of Regents, Section 41. Throughout the Board of Regents under the B units, you'll see some restorations for the reductions we had to make in the 21 budget. And so I won't go into each one of those but you'll see them under Ag Experiment, Crofted Extension. Several other things throughout the document. But under Enterprise Innovation Institute, you'll just see a language item at 41.4.4, just stating that Invest George's shall remain at the Board of Regents. We've proposed moving that last year. However, it does require statutory change and it was just simpler to leave it where it is now. You'll see the Restoration again at Forestry Extension under Forestry Research. Then under the Cyber Innovation and Training Center, the removal of one-time funds for the Cybersecurity, Maternity Model Certification Program, those funds were initially needed for the federal match that went with those. And then under GRE, Georgia Research Alliance, you'll see under 41.9.2, our $500,000 commitment to endow an imminent Scholar Program for sickle cell research. This will be done in partnership with Morehouse, Children's Healthcare at Atlanta, and with Emory University. I didn't realize until the other day that Choa, Children's Healthcare at Atlanta, is kind of ex-officio, one of the largest research institutions in the country, maybe even the world isn't related to sickle cell research. Just by happenstance that they see a lot of individuals with that issue and help in treatment. You'll see the Restorations again under Georgia Tech Research Institute, the Marine Institute, the Marine Extension Center. And then under the Medical College of Georgia, Restoration there as well for the FY21 cuts. 41.14.4, you'll see the library adjustment that I mentioned of adding a nickel to the per capita rate there for them. At 41.15.3, as it relates to Georgia Youth Science Technology Center, the Restoration there as well. And then at 41.18.7, under teaching, an addition for year two of the three year phase end for the increased medical education funding for Augustine University and the Medical College of Georgia there, 7.7 million. Additional Restoration under VetMed Experiment. And then moving on down to Georgia Military College, one of the attached agencies for administrative purposes within Regents. And you'll see formula true ups there as it relates to GMC. Moving on to Section 42, Department of Revenue. You'll see an addition there under industry regulation at 42.3.1, but you'll also see in another add at 42.9.2. And those do all tie back to House Bill 375 from last year that deal with vaping regulation in the state of Georgia, just the individuals that deal are needs to make sure that they have to implement that program and that law statewide. Under Secretary of State under professional licensing boards at 43.5.1, an add of 150,000, as it relates to those temporary permits for nurses coming into the state to help with the vaccination program. And then under Access to Medical Cannabis, the commission there at 43.7.1, that's an attached agency, standing them up to be fully operational. The license has been applied far the deposits have been made. Now they're going into the process of naming who those vendors will be. So we need to make sure that we've got everything in place to carry out the will of the general assembly as it relates to that program. Under Student Finance, Section 44, under Dillon Roamit, you'll see we've taken the same adjustment that we made in the amended budget as it relates to Dillon Roamit. Under the engineering scholarship again, an add there of $192,500, that covers 55 additional students in that program. That program is growing, so it's needed for an adjustment there. Under HOPE grant at 44.7.1, that is a true up just a slight decrease in increase from what the governor's original recommendation had been there. Section 45, Teacher of Retirement System, no changes. Section 46 is the technical college system of Georgia. Only a couple changes here. 46.6.2, the elimination of funds for the rural technical work of pilot program. That program has not been implemented. Should they get it up and off the ground, we will address that then, either later in this budget cycle or in the amended budget. Section 47, Department of Transportation, I've joked numerous times about Chairman Perkel, just had to find something to do because most of this is formerly driven. However, as we find ourselves with some additional federal funds coming in under the CARES relief packages, it does require some adjustments. You'll see one of those first adjustments at 47.1.1 is it relates to capital construction projects. As we were here in 2015 and past House Bill 170, one of the things, one of the driving forces behind that was understanding that we could tackle construction projects using state funds, turn out the project quicker and typically at about a 30% less cost than if we had to follow all the federal rules and regulations that go with it. So with the CARES dollars coming into transportation, we're going to use those CARES dollars to recognize those under maintenance for road paving and those kind of things and then use the state dollars that are going to state motor fuel dollars that are going into it then for those capital construction projects. At 1.2 and 1.3, what you see there is just basically language changes and clean up, just making sure that everyone understands where the funds are coming from as it relates to the free deficiency program and the broadband development programs with the OT and then a road safety improvement project at 47.1.4. The adjustment for the CARES dollars at 47.2.1 and at 47.3.2, just to language change, changing that program from construction admin to program delivery admin to better fit what its actual purpose is. Under Intermodal, as I mentioned earlier, recognizing those ride share fees that are to go directly to transit, recognizing those dollars here is about 7.6 million dollars. One million of that is tagged at this point for an improvement project, Natham's Clark County, 638,000 and change will be used for other projects across the state. 6 million will be working with Marta on the bank head station improvements for regional economic development project going there and then just a bump of cash for security improvement on some of our state on rail facilities at 47.6.3. At 47.13.4, you'll see us going back and restoring the reduction we took there at the Georgia Transportation Infrastructure Bank and then the recognition of the bond sales under SIRTA at 47.13.5 and the dollars that are needed for the debt service on it. Section 48, Veteran Services, no changes, Section 49 workers, COMP, no changes, and of course Section 50 are bond projects and you'll you have all I'm sure at this point already looked at what those are. So, Mr. Chairman, that completes the walk through the tracking sheet. I know that everyone's had this in front of them for several hours and we had real good attendance yesterday in the committee. A lot of really good interaction, a lot of really good input from members as we've gone through the entire budget crafting process. So with that said, I'll be glad to take a couple of questions but I know that we've got a lot of measures on the calendar today that need to be looked at and we all want to get on and see family and friends this weekend as well. So, I'll stop right there and see if we've got any questions. Well, Mr. Chairman, I think we probably need another hour of a little more detail on a couple of little issues. What do you think? Everybody's welcome to come see me at my chair if they're wanting that. I'll be glad to. Well, Mr. Chairman, as always, an outstanding job of a comprehensive review of a very, very important document. And if I may express my gratitude, and I believe the gratitude of the members of this body to you, to Christine and Martha, and to your entire committee and all the subcommittee chairs for great work, great input and a lot of hard work on this document. Mr. Chairman, I would also, if you allow me, to recognize that this is our first year with both budgets that did not have the fingerprints of Chairman Hill on these budgets. But I would also remind you, Mr. Chairman, that there are a number of folks around this state that depend on this state for their livelihood that were concerned when Senator Hill passed. Mr. Chairman, I would tell you that your business acumen and your humanity, they feel very secure that you are and that you have a steady hand on making sure their needs are taken care of. So Mr. Chairman, I want to personally thank you for your humanity and your dedication to the people of this state as you work through these budgets and some very difficult times. Mr. Chairman, you're much too kind in that. You know, as you and I have talked about it several times, it's not a day that goes by that I don't think about my friend and mentor Jack Hill. Last April, that Monday afternoon, getting the phone call, saying that Jack had passed away, certainly, certainly left hold of my heart as it did a lot of George's. Jack had, Jack could be a little bit of sandpaper when he needed to be, but he was also a lot of lambs wool too. One of the kindest-hearted men that I've ever had the pleasure of working with meant toward me a friend, a big brother and a lot of sorts and a father figure in many ways as well. The loss to me was acute as I know it was, many of you in this room that had been friends with Jack for decades and it certainly been felt across this state and I just, I don't know what to say other than he taught me a lot and I realized over the intervening months since his passing that he taught me a lot more than I realized he had taught me. I can tell you he's proud day he's looking down smaller so I can tell you that for sure. I know that for a fact. Just an observation Mr. Chairman and a little bit of a question you touched on it but I would like to focus a little bit more on it. This state and this country and our people have been through a lot over the preceding months in this year of 2021 as we look into 22. The emphasis on the mental health aspect of this budget is much appreciated Mr. Chairman and another thing that I believe is really important, your continued support for the FQHCs that take care of a lot of people across this state in rural and urban settings. Those two things really stand out of my mind Mr. Chairman. Well our subcommittee and chair lady Dempsey did an incredible job as it relates to the mental health services additions. I know that our speaker has a huge compassion and huge heart for those issues as do all of us in this room and of course as it relates to FQHC's Chairman Parrish has been a long standing advocate for those and I think any of us that realize what they do in our communities we all can be thankful for the dedication of those individuals who have been doing testing throughout the intervening months who are now putting shots and arms in the work that our FQHCs do to bring primary care to areas that do not have any other access to primary care. Mr. Chairman would you be willing to yield for our question? Yes sir. At this time the chair would recognize in room 341 did he waive? I think he did. Mr. Chairman this is amazing but I think you I think you um talked everyone to conclusion and satisfaction. Well it's point that I talked to him to sleep as I'm telling which it might be. We see no further question or no questions Mr. Chairman thank you for your presentation and um yes sir we will recognize you again in a moment but we we'll have some folks that would like to speak to the bill. All right thank you sir and appreciate everybody's attention and ask for your support consideration of House Bill 81 and thank you thank you Mr. Chairman. This time the chair will recognize representative Wilson to speak to House Bill 81. He waives. Chair will now represent will recognize Chairman excuse me representing Jasmine Clark to speak to the bill.

Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you. The lady has recognized. Recently, our governor has been making the rounds on the news circuit, a gas at the funding formula for the American Rescue Plan. He has appalled that the formula isn't bringing, quote, enough cares funding to Georgia. We have even had members of this body decry the same right here in this well. At the same time, we have also had members of this body, including the chair today in his presentation, mention how federal cares act money fills or plugs holes in our budget from sustained cuts and multiple areas of the budget, including education and health care. Meanwhile, we are loading up our revenue shortfall reserve. AKA our rainy day fund. This is the equivalent of not having enough food in the refrigerator, but instead of going into our savings account that has more than enough money to fill the fridge, we take what little extra money we do have and put it into the savings account and then turn to the federal government with our handout. But that's another story for another day. Today, I want to talk about how our governor and members of this chamber see the value and the necessity for collaboration and cooperation with the federal government for the greater good of the people in our state. Yet, they are vehemently opposed to Medicaid expansion, which would provide billions in matching funds and give hundreds of thousands of Georgians access to health care and save rural hospitals from shuttering their doors. We lost two rural hospitals in 2020 in the middle of a pandemic, reducing access to critical care and resulting in loss jobs in those areas. And it did not have to happen that way. It really makes me question our priorities. Ladies and gentlemen of this August body, we cannot have it both ways. Continuing to turn away billions of Georgia taxpayer dollars, billions of Georgia taxpayer dollars that go to other states that have expanded Medicaid, while bragging about taking funds to backfill cuts that we created instead of using our own money and then crying on TV about the next round of funding not being enough doesn't make sense. I understand that we are constitutionally required to pass a balanced budget. I respect the amount of work that goes into finding the right balance with the budget we must work with. I also recognize that there are some great things in this budget, but I absolutely cannot reconcile throwing away billions, billions with a B, billions in federal funds that would help all of our constituents have access to health care that would save our rural hospitals from closing. And that would save as well as create jobs, especially when we take federal funds when it is convenient for us. Thank you, Mr. Chair, you're the well. The lady has yielded the well. Chair now recognizes leader Beverly. His comments. Leader Beverly. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Today, I rise in opposition to HB81 for some substantive reasons, and if you would lend your attention to me for just a few seconds, I'll let you know why. Because my colleague just spoke to the idea that there are over 400,000 Georgians who now have pre-existing conditions as a result of contracting COVID, becomes almost a dereliction of duty to not make sure that those people are covered. We think about the vehicles that we have within the state to address health care coverage. The first thing that comes in mind should be Medicaid expansion. A few years ago in 2019, we talked deliberately about the waiver 1115 waivers, which I think we refer to as the patient first act. So many of you may or may not know is that that work requirement that we had in that space, that the Biden administration has now has that under review. And because it's under review, it's probably going to be severed from the work requirement will require that 1115 waiver will probably be null and void. There's money right now contemplated in a budget and you'll get an amendment that I placed will be placed on your desk in just a few minutes that would take the amount of money to implement the 1115 waiver and use that to expand Medicaid. The same money coming out of the same space, but we should start thinking about how do we use that money to expand Medicaid. And if you look at the tracking document, it's 11.1.3. It's two and a half million dollars that would start that conversation. Now, we know there's some structural issues that we would need to deal with to expand Medicaid. We'd have to have a constitutional amendment. We'd have to adopt that amendment. We'd have to do much more things. But this gives us a chance to now say to the 400,000 Georgians who now have preexisting conditions because of a global pandemic that we care about you for real. So while I respect the chairman immensely in the work that they put in into this budget, there's some fundamental structural problems about not dealing with this issue right now with the expansion of Medicaid that we need to deal with and we can do that today. The last thing I want to leave you with is this. As many of you know, the American Rescue Plan, which is what has come to mind when we talk about money coming into the state, it contemplates that if we, if we, would expand Medicaid that $2 billion for Georgians, $2 billion over the next two years, will increase the F-MAT by five percentage points, which would basically make Medicaid expansion for the next five years, no cost of Georgia, zero cost to Georgians because of the American Rescue Plan. So I vote against this budget today because I think there's a better way moving forward. If you want to talk to me about how we can do it, we certainly right there at my desk I'll be here, but I'll be voting against HB81 because there's a better way to do this budget. We just need to take a little time to do it. Thank you, Mr. Chair, yield the well. Gentlemen, yields the well. Mr. Later, the proper time for your amendment to be considered will win the Committee of the whole is dissolved. At this time, there's no further speakers and Chair will now recognize the gentleman from the 116th Chairman England for a motion. Miss Chairman, I move that House Bill 81 do pass by the Committee substitute. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for that motion. Chair now recognizes the gentleman from the 155th Chairman Perkel for a second. Mr. Chairman, it's my privilege to acknowledge the work of this body on this appropriation measure by offering a second to the substitute to HB81, the fiscal year 22 budget. Representative Perkel seconds the motion. Thank you. At this time, we'll call the question on House Bill 81. All in favor will say aye. All opposed, no. The eyes have it and House Bill 81 passes by Committee substitute. Mr. Chair now recognizes the gentleman from the 116th Chairman England. Miss Chairman, as chairman of the Committee of the whole House, you are instructed to report the action of the Committee of the whole House to the House. Mr. Chairman, I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman. Chair recognizes majority leader Burns. Mr. Speaker, the Committee of the whole House has had under consideration House Bill 81 and has instructed me as his chairman to report the same back to the House with the recommendation that House Bill 81 do pass by Committee substitute. Mr. Chairman, the Committee of the whole House has received the Committee of the whole House has had under consideration House Bill 81 and has reported the same back to the House with the recommendation that House Bill 81 do pass by Committee substitute. The Committee of the whole House is hereby dissolved. Okay, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Okay, we're going now to consider the amendments under the rules of the House, the rules calendar. This bill was reported to the floor under the modified open rule, which requires that any amendments lay on the desk for an hour prior to being considered. The Chair would ask if the membership of this body would waive that rule so that we can go ahead and consider the amendments. Is there objection? Chair, here's none. That rule is waived and the amendments will be considered. Okay, clerk is going to project the amendment on the screen and read the amendment. Perhaps I have been read the 143rd district moves to amend the House appropriations Committee substitute HB1, HB81 by moving funds from following agencies and programs, agency program DCA, funding source in about 1713, 762, 2065, 625, 513, 755, 80, 269, 81. 756, 424, 201, 554, the purpose of the amendments to provide funds to begin implementation of the Patient First Act. Perhaps I am Beverly, the 133rd district moves to amend the House appropriations Committee substitute HB81 by adding funds to following agencies and programs, agency program DCA, funding source in about 1713, 762, 625, 513, 755, 756, 82, 85, 314. three-fourteen, 748, 426, 827, 067, the purpose of this amendment is to provide funds to begin the implementation of full Medicaid expansion. Okay, here's our procedure. The chair is asked out of fairness that to allow the amendments to be considered without sitting on the desk for an hour. So we're going to take them up. There are two different amendments. The posture we're in is if the Beverly AM-1 amendment fails, then we would not take up the Beverly AM-2 amendment. We would only go to Beverly AM-2 in the event that the House were to adopt the first amendment. So the question we have, the amendment on the desk, we'll put it on the board. All those in favor of adopting the Beverly AM-1 amendment will vote I. Those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does the representative lot rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Isn't it true, Mr. Speaker, that the Affordable Care Act created a gap and was the Medicaid expansion that they are speaking of here would only help near 250,000 Georgians that are uninsured that fall under the 100% of the federal poverty line. Where this patient's first act that we have passed here will help over a million Georgians. The 1115 waiver would help the near 250,000 able-bodied uninsured that are under 100% of the federal poverty line. And the 1332 waiver was designed to lower the premiums for those that are on the federal exchange health insurance plans. Therefore, helping far more Georgians and that this amendment should be considered. I'm sure the lady believes that to be true. What purpose does representative draw or rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Speaker, isn't it true that if someone in the state of Georgia's mom, dad, sister, brother, and or uncle doesn't have health insurance, the thing that we can do to get the most health care dollars into our state and cover the most people is to expand under the Affordable Care Act and accept leader Beverly's amendment. I'm sure the gentleman believes that to be true. All members voted on the Beverly amendment. On the Beverly amendment. AM1 have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the Beverly AM1 amendment. The eyes are 68, the nays are 98. The amendment has failed. And we will not consider the Beverly AM2 amendment. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill. The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of House Bill 81 will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. If all members voted, have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 81. The eyes are 136. The nays are 31. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Chair, what purpose does Chairman England rise? So I'm going to run across the room, I guess, Mr. Speaker. Make a motion. State your motion. Move to immediately transmit House Bill 81, the FY22 budget to the Senate. Chairman England has moved that House Bill 81 be immediately transmitted across the hall to the Georgia State Senate. Is there any objection? Is there objection? The chair here is none and it is so ordered. This House will be in recess for lunch until 115. Thank you. Thank you.
