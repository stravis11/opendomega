morning. What a beautiful day again out there today. I hope everybody had a
a great weekend, ready to go to work this week. You will notice that the chaplain of the
day was actually here at the invitation of Representative Rob Leveritt, and many of
you probably know we'll get an announcement out sometime today of Rob Leveritt's mother
passed away on Saturday and so he's not going to be present today or tomorrow. So our
chaplain as a result this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 18th
House District who is filling in for Representative Leveritt and that is Representative Tyler Paul
Smith, Representative Smith.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning.
It is an honor to introduce to you today our pastor of the day.
Representative Rob Leveritt called me and hope you'll all join me in praying for
his family with the loss of his mother Florence this morning, but today I get to introduce
to you another brother of mine in Christ, Pastor Kim McClarry, and Pastor Kim, Pastor's
New Dove Creek Church in Elberton, Georgia, and has for the past 20 years.
So I think that speaks highly of him and his commitment to the gospel in his community.
has been married to Miss McCleary for even longer 22 years and I hope you'll pray for
her and supporting him and his ministry as they go along. So without further ado, it is
an honor to introduce to you today Pastor Cam McCleary.
Well good morning, it is an honor to be here, I'm thankful that Representative
Leveritt and I'm humbled that he asked me to come and appreciate all of your
hospitality and I'm just grateful for this opportunity. Can we have a moment of
Can we take a moment of silence for representative leverage with the setting passing of his mom?
Thank you
First, given unto the God and to my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, to the speaker of the
house, representative Levert and his absence, representative Smith, thank you for that introduction
and to my lovely wife, Sheikah.
I love Sheikah, amen.
Because we approach this upcoming Thanksgiving season, I feel led to invite us to ponder the
importance of being thankful and the positive attraction we create through our attitudes
of gratitude.
The Bible it monishes us in 1 Thessalonians 5 and 18.
In everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.
God's will for us to be thankful every day. So I encourage all of you to thank God for the
opportunity to serve the people of Georgia. Thank God for love and support of your families
who make sacrifices along with you as you diligently work here. Be thankful to God for every small
victory, we have obtained, despite otherwise bleak and dim conditions that have plagued many
through sickness, sorrow, and even death.
Right now thinking about representative leverage, even in death, his mother.
I'm thankful for your leadership doing these difficult times.
It is clear to me this level of leadership comes with great responsibility and sacrifice
that is met with opposition as you come together
to make decisions for the constituents
of each city and county you represent.
Although there are challenges,
there's also grace for the assignment given by our Lord.
As noted in the book of Esther,
that depicts the story of Queen Esther
who is raised up by God to save her people from destruction.
I believe God has raised you up to lead
the residents of Georgia through the current struggles we are now facing.
Through gratitude and thanks given, I encourage you to keep hoping and believing that your
efforts will be proven as productive, meaningful, and impactful, improving the quality of life
of Georgians.
As a man of faith, I believe things will get better.
Today I encourage each of you to remain steadfast, dedicated, and determined to your individual
and collective assignments to make our state a better Georgia for all.
I pray that God continues to lead each of you with His wisdom, bless you with His favor,
and promote you as you give Him thanks every day.
May God bless you, may God bless America, and may God bless our beautiful state, Georgia,
God dogs.
Can't forget the braids either.
Will you join me in a word of prayer?
Let us pray.
Gracious Father, we come to You in the name of Jesus, Lord God, we come say thank You this
morning.
Lord God, we come to bless your name because you are great, magnificent and worthy to be
praise.
Lord God, continue to lead the house of representatives, continue to lead all the leaders in the state
of Georgia as they make decisions that impact lives every day.
Bless their families, bless their marriages and their homes.
Lord God, their businesses and the counties they represent, the counties in cities they
represent.
Lord God, we lift up representative leverage.
Lord God, in his time of loss right now, pray that you give him and his family peace.
on this time of transition.
Father God also asked that I let pray for all the families,
the churches, all communities.
Lord God represented in this state.
We pray that your hand of protection, blessing and favor,
Lord God will continue to guide us
doing these challenging times.
You are still our answer.
You're still our hope.
You're still a source of peace and joy.
And we thank you for that now.
We thank you for our son, your son Jesus Christ,
who died for us, who was raised from the dead from us,
that we can have an eternal life with you.
And Lord God, I thank you and praise you
for this great opportunity to speak some words today.
I pray that those words went into good ground
and they will produce a harvest
that you will always be pleased of.
We give you all the praise, the glory and the honor
in Jesus' name.
Amen.
I pledge that we just to declare
of the United States of America
to the republic for which it stands.
One nation under God,
individual, with liberty to exist as far.

I have not read the Gwinnett County Legislation because I don't think it's in the house yet, is it?
is it? During the general, during the general session.

than three minutes each. Chair recognizes
Chairman Knight for a morning order.
I'm not sure if representative Dickey or Washburn on the floor, you may want to.
and Susan. It seems like a lot of tragedy has happened lately and I guess we all
wonder why and question why it happened but many of you may not know but the last
Wednesday, Mrs. Shirley Treadwell, 93, her caregiver, Deborah Ruth Hall, 66,
were leaving her son's farm after a day of visit. Their car stalled on the railroad
tracks that crossed the driveway. My friend, Chris Burkett, who lived on the farm
and who was actually were going to offense about 30 yards away from the railroad
track, saw the car had stalled and heard the train coming. He ran as quickly as he could
to try to help his friends get out of the car. Unfortunately tragically they were all killed.
It's ironic that my friend, Chris Burkett, survived a tornado in 2020 on that exact same
farm. As my brother-in-law helped getting out of the debris and helped also find
this is dog that they thought were gone. And I guess it wasn't at that point
God's time to take Chris. We still wonder why. As I talked to his brother and
sister and the treadmill family and everyone out there yesterday as we did
or memorial, sometimes it's not for us to question the whys and question God because he always
has a purpose and he always has a lesson, as I spoke to Chris's brother and sister.
I think we take away an example of what Chris' life meant to others, an unassuming man
just ordinary, but who had the courage of his convictions, that he was always helping
others, no matter where it was, all you had to do was ask.
But also in his final act, that he gave his life, John 1513 says, greater love has no
one than this than to lay down one's life for his friends.
Please join me in a moment of silence as we honor Chris Perquette, Shirley Tredwell and
Deborah Ruth Hall and Tommy Tredwell, the family and the whole family in this tragic event.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. We come with heavy hearts this morning.
last week we lost a great leader in Augusta. The Reverend Dr. Johnny R. Hadney. Dr.
Hadney's service and celebration of life was done on Thursday, Veterans Day,
and he was a veteran. He pastored our church for 40 years. He was my pastor. He was
also my constituent, and he was also my friend. He is a former Richmond
County Commissioner and School Board trustee. Dr. Hackney did so much for so many for so long.
The City of Augusta has lost a great giant. We will remember his legacy and we ask you to join us
not a moment of silence. Thank you. Chair recognizes representative camp for
a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning. Yesterday was
International Diabetes Day and today I wear blue as a reminder that diabetes
is managed not cured. As a family impacted by diabetes from my 77-year-old father to my
newly recently diagnosed two-year-old great nephew, there is a tremendous toll that diabetes
takes on a family and individuals emotionally through quality of life and financially. There
are almost 600 million individuals worldwide who deal with diabetes daily. Treatments have
improved, but funding and research is needed to care diabetes. Thank you.
Okay, we're going on to the rules calendar.
Going on to the rules calendar, clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 1EX.
Senate bill 1EX by Senator Kennedy, 18th cows of the 46,
doobin on the 30th, Gucci, the 51st, Burk,
with the 11th and others being taut of the act to provide
for the composition and number of state sanitorial districts.
This bill I've referred to the Committee on Legislative
and Congressional Reapportion at that committee
recommends that this bill do pass.
Chair recognizes Chairman Rich to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House.
Today, I rise to bring you Senate Bill 1EX, which is the State Senate's redistricting
plan for 2021.
This bill is the culmination of a very similar process that we went through here in the House.
In fact, we in the House Committee traveled with members of the Senate Redistricting Committee
across the state holding the joint hearings this summer.
We also followed a similar process in the consideration of the written comments.
Senator Kennedy, the chair of the redistricting committee met with the vast majority of the
members of our state senate to discuss their districts before drawing the maps that you
see before you today. You have a copy of those maps on your desk for your review and there
is also a digital version on the screens. The ideal population size for the senate is
A bit larger than ours, 191,284.
And they redistricted their 56 districts
according to that ideal population size,
with a deviation of plus or minus 1%.
Similar to the house, their number one priority
was complying with the Constitution
and the Voting Rights Act.
They also adopted guidelines.
the guidelines that the Senate adopted were identical to the guidelines that we adopted
in the House Committee. They had a unanimous vote. All members of the redistricting committee
and the Senate voted for the guidelines that were employed in redrawing those districts.
The Senate map takes into account the changes in our population and diversity of our state
They have drawn 14 majority black voting age population districts in accordance with
the Voting Rights Act.
They also have drawn six minority opportunity districts for a total of 20 majority non-white
districts.
Their current map that they are operating under today splits 39 counties.
The proposed map that went through the Senate process and as before you hear today splits
only 29 counties.
And these are the maps that they have proposed for themselves and passed out of their chamber.
I am told I was not here as some of you were but I am told that it is customary for us
to review the other chambers maps for compliance with the law, the Constitution and the Voting
Rights Act.
to respect the decisions that they made with respect to their districts and we have done
that here. We were engaged in a similar process and our Senate counterparts also engaged
council to ensure compliance with the Voting Rights Act and I am comfortable standing
before you here today to let you know that this Senate map has gone through the House
committee as well and we believe that it is in compliance with the Constitution and the
Voting Rights Act. For that reason, I am requesting your favorable approval and if anyone
has any questions, I am available to answer those.
You do not appear to have any questions.
Okay. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. And thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
The Rules Committee has limited debate on all of the measures on the calendar today to a total of one hour on each measure.
That time to be allocated at the discretion of the chair.
I'm going to make that equal in division.
We have some members that have signed up to speak in opposition to this bill.
the opponents will have 30 minutes total to be allocated as they choose and 30
minutes is up and not all of them have been heard, then that will end it. So Chair
recognizes representative Wynn to speak to the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
We know that redistricting is a technical process, and it is hard to put into words without
getting too wonky why this is so important to Georgians.
It is not a kitchen table issue like health care or livable wages.
It doesn't solve the problem of keeping food on the table or paying medical bills, and
And when our constituents are trying to take care of their children or trying to find
secure housing, it's easy to see why drawing maps isn't a kitchen table conversation.
But we are home to 10.6 million Georgians.
And here we are today relying on 900 comments, a dozen or so town hall meetings, and a handful
of Rush committee hearings.
And we are left to make the decisions that will impact our constituents for the next ten
years.
But here's the difference.
We in this body, we know very well that maps determine the pathway to get to these
kitchen cabinet issues.
By electing representatives who may or may not push for health care, by electing representatives
who may or may not increase our state minimum wage of 515 an hour, and we know that when
And maps are drawn to curry favor to one party or another.
We end up in a place where 70% of Georgians support Medicaid expansion and their representatives
still do not reflect the will of the people.
We know very well the task here at hand and it is our responsibility to do right by the
citizens of Georgia.
This map does not do right by the people of Georgia.
And how we got here, this process is just as important as what's in the map.
When the majority parties started hosting hearings, earlier this summer, we heard from
Georgians over and over again.
Georgians want transparency, Georgians want fair maps, Georgians want the opportunity to
participate in a meaningful process, a process that includes all Georgians, not just some
Georgia's. The calls for in-language access went unheard. In a state where our
Hispanic population is 10.5 percent, our AAPI population is 4.5 percent.
Georgia's with limited English proficiency could not participate in a
process that determines how they will be represented for the next 10 years.
Section 2 of the Federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 not only prohibits
discrimination based on race, but it also protects language minority groups. We as a body
should act in good faith when members of the public requested over and over again the opportunity
for language minority groups to participate. The calls to reflect Georgia's population growth
also went unheard. Over the last 10 years, Georgia's population grew by 1 million people and that
growth is exclusively comprised of people of color. This map refails to reflect that
growth. It does not increase the total number of majority minority district. And it turns
Senate District 48 into a majority white district. And I want to talk about Senate District 48
for just a moment. My colleague on the Senate side who currently represents Senate District 48
is the only Asian woman in the Senate,
one out of 56 members.
And it took our state 230 years
to elect an Asian-American woman on the Senate side.
And during her remarks on the floor, she said,
one of the truest measures of Georgia's diversity
is that someone like me gets to be in this room at all.
And it's because of this increasing diversity
of cultures, of ethnicities, of politics and ideals,
that someone like me, who came from the background that I do,
could ever get elected in a state senate,
representing a district that up until three years ago
had only ever been represented by white men.
This is exactly what we mean
by keeping communities of interests together.
This is what we mean when we talk about allowing
the people to elect the representatives of their choice so that their voices will be heard.
It means when six Asian women are brutally murdered in our state, we know there will
be at least one woman on the Senate side who can speak about cultural barriers, who can
speak about language barriers, and who can speak about the fears that plague the Asian
American community, just like the Senator did from Senate District 48 earlier this year.
And here we are, a state we've added 1 million Georgians, Asian Americans being the fastest
growing population in our state.
And the majority party drew a map that targets the only Asian woman in the Senate.
And they did so by diluting the voices of black and brown voters.
This district used to be 60% minority.
It is now 53.8% white.
But the failure of this map is not just about one district.
Georgians told us last year, and again this year, we are a 50-50 state.
We are a battleground state.
We are a swing state.
This map tells us a different story.
This map creates a 60-40 split with the advantage given to the Republican Party for the next
10 years.
Majority rule is a cornerstone of our democracy, and so is the right to vote.
But we are not seeing these principles reflected in our legislative body today.
What we see instead is one party trying to install minority rule.
We are witnessing power grab, on top of power grab, on top of power grab.
The takeover of Fulton County election board, the introduction of a bill that splits apart
the city of Atlanta from a representative who doesn't even live in that area.
A pair of bills targeting Gwyneth County introduced without the consent of the local delegation
and without the input of local elected officials in Gwyneth
or the residents who actually live there.
And then there is this map, a map that does not reflect
the Georgia of today.
This is about one thing and one thing only.
It is about diluting the voices of Georgians,
specifically black and brown Georgians.
It is anti-democratic and erodes the foundation
of our democracy.
This great American experiment,
which ought to be carried on through healthy debate
and competing ideas, not by changing the rules,
not by casting aside the will of the people,
and certainly not by creating an uneven playing field
through gerrymandered maps.
Mr. Speaker, I yield the will.
Okay
Y'all are on the same side
Thought y'all were like running against each other
Chair recognizes
Chair recognizes representative Derek Jackson to speak to the bill
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Good morning colleagues. I rise today to talk about the
critical importance of fair maps as a starting point for a fair and open
democracy. Fair maps are crucial to ensuring that every Georgia's vote counts
equally. Indeed, our entire system of democracy is based upon fair representation. Under this
auspicious go-dome, we speak regularly about ensuring the right and access to the vote.
Voting access begins now with this process of map drawing to ensure fairness without
overly manipulated district lines.
Jury Mandarin, the process of drawing district boundaries
to favor a party, a class, or a race,
is deeply undemocratic.
It suppresses the voices and the votes of Georgians
that is disadvantages.
Unfortunately, the proposed map offered by majority
And the process by which the majority appears intent of speedy approval falls short, far
short of a fair map or a fair and transparent process.
Over the last decade, Georgia's population has grown by 1 million people plus.
But population change is not simply a number.
Each of these 1 million people are Georgians.
And we cannot ignore who those Georgians are.
The entirety of the growth over the last decade is a result of growth in the number of minority
residents.
The white population of the state decreased by 4%.
African Americans make up 30.6% of the population.
Hispanic or Latinos are 10.5% of the population.
Hispanic Asian people made a 4.4% of the state population and 6.9% of the
residents say they are more than one race. Every map the general assembly passes
must recognize that Georgia is not only becoming more diverse but also more
urban. The majority of the state's growth over the last decade has
occurred in metropolitan Atlanta. Even more critically Georgia should not be
discriminated against and based upon the color of their screen, or the language they speak.
Georgia voters of color must be given an equal opportunity to elect their candidates of choice.
The Senate Democratic Caucus proposed a map that contains more majority minority districts and more black majority districts than the majority's proposal.
Put simply it provides more opportunities for minorities to elect their candidates of choice
It is unconscionable to me that the map we are discussing and voting on today
Disregards Georgia's population growth centers and the diversity of the state
Drawing district lines to for to for stall the inevitable change that has come in and
What we all know to be true about Georgia's changing population and a diversity is
is dishonest and unfair to voters.
In a state where voters have elected a Republican governor
and a Democratic president,
in races for statewide offices can be decided
by less than 4%.
It is absurd that maps for the legislature
can't be more reflective of the true political feelings
of Georgia's.
The maps we approve should reflect Georgia
as it is now, not the Georgia of a decade ago or more.
If you vote yes on this map today,
you are voting to discard the representative government.
You are voting to disenfranchise millions
of Georgian citizens.
You are voting to invite costly legal challenges
that will incur to defend an unconstitutional map.
You are privileging your own power above
that of your fellow citizens.
People elected you in good faith.
They expect you to uphold the basic principles of democracy.
In the words of a young Georgian who testified against this map,
it is not a matter of right or left.
It is a matter of right and wrong.
For these reasons, I am voting no to Senate Bill 1EX.
Mr. Speaker, I year the well.
Chair recognizes representative Allen to speak to the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I rise in opposition of Senate Bill 1EX.
We have heard quite a bit about the work
has gone into the creation of this map.
At the beginning, we heard a lot about how
there should be a fair and open process
in this important once in a decade process
of determining political representation in Georgia.
We heard that the committee traveled the state
to hear from Georgians about their redistricting wishes.
It's worth noting that all of the places that hearings were
held, only one hearing was held in the city of Atlanta,
and only one hearing in the Metro,
the regions where majority of our voting population resides.
Georgians asked for a map to be released
with ample time for public consideration
and input before making them final.
Yet here we are with maps that flew through
the Senate Reapportionment Committee in a couple of days,
changed the night before the hearing
and passed along party lines
less than 72 hours after they were made available.
Georgians asked for a clear explanation
of why the district lines were drawn and how they were drawn.
But all we heard was mostly obfuscation
regarding the most critical and contentious districts
like some of my colleagues have laid out.
Georgians wanted a deliberative process
in which the public's input would matter.
Instead, we took the public's orders
and then serve them something entirely different.
It's a slap in the face to the public
to have a hearing process without incorporating their feedback.
The people's efforts to participate in hearings
was not taken seriously, and it doesn't mean anything
to allow people to speak if we refuse to act on their feedback.
Now, Democrats came into this process in good faith.
The Georgia State Senate Democratic Caucus
provided a draft map well in advance of hearings
that was ready to be debated and perfected
through the legislative process,
involving the public and the other party in every step.
Instead, Republicans ran through the map
that was drawn to preserve Republican power
at the expense of Georgians everywhere.
Republicans picked and choosed
what aspects of public input they wanted to incorporate.
Passed it over public please for more time and consideration
and excluded the other party,
telling everyone they should just hush up
and be happy it wasn't worse.
Well, I don't deny that a lot of time and effort
went into this map, but was it truly the effort
of the people's business?
And to what end?
To draw a map that seeks to enshrine the power
of one party to shield them from accountability,
when what we should be doing is preserving the power
and the will of the people of Georgia.
Thank you, Ms. Speaker, I yield.
Chair recognizes Representative Beth Moore
to speak to the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and good morning, colleagues.
A lot of consideration has gone into the drawing
of these maps.
We know what some of those things are, right, population,
demographics, political trends, and yes,
in competency.
And as other speakers on these maps have noted,
it's not about protecting one person.
It's about protecting the relationship
that a community has with their chosen representatives.
But did anyone who drew these maps stop to consider
its impact on women?
Women in the legislature,
and women's voices across the state.
Of the 180 representatives serving right here in this body,
only 63 of us are women, approximately 35%,
even though we represent half of the entire human experience
on this planet.
Of course, the Senate is worse.
Of 56 senators, only 17 of them are women, approximately 30%.
According to the Center for American Women in Politics at Rutgers University, in the
year 2021, women comprise 31 percent of state legislators nationally. Women of color
make up only 26.5 percent of those women currently serving in state legislatures. A recent
editorial in the AJC points out that the redistricting process can be especially challenging
for female representatives. Women are usually more recently elected and therefore less likely
to serve in leadership. That makes them more vulnerable to the power dynamics that impact
redistricting. At a time when the number of women elected to local office is just starting
to climb out of the basement. We should not be drawing maps that make it harder for women
incumbents or harder for women to run and win in new districts. We should not be making
changes that have a greater impact on districts held by women. But unfortunately that is exactly
what this Senate map does. In drawing the proposed new Senate District 48, the Republican
map is targeting a female senator, my senator, the woman that my community chose to represent
us, who happens to also be the only female Asian American senator serving in the entire
state of Georgia.
The Republican map is also making major changes to the sixth Senate district, which is held
Yes, by another prominent female senator.
With so few women serving Georgia to begin with,
how is it that so many of them are being targeted
with harmful redistricting changes?
We are watching a process in which primarily men
are using their accumulated power to diminish
the political impact of female legislators
and therefore, Georgia voters.
So what does this all mean for women of Georgia?
It means that the issues impacting women the most,
and I would argue impacting families the most,
including childcare, maternal mortality,
reproductive health, will continue to be overlooked
and underfunded.
So let's be truthful.
When you use the redistricting process
to harm and target women's districts.
You harm and target all women and all families
across the state of Georgia.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield.
Okay, that completes the speakers.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
The chair here is none.
The previous question is ordered.
We have a minority report under the rules of the House.
We'll have 20 minutes for the minority report.
The chair recognizes representative Bays Moore.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
And good morning, colleagues.
Colleagues, we came here with the direction to redraw our legislative maps so that they
might reflect changes to the state over the prior decade.
And Georgia has seen a lot of changes.
The census data tells us that we have gained over 1 million new residents.
population growth has largely occurred within our urban areas. The census also
tells us that all of that is great, this great state has grown more diverse. In
fact, Georgia is probably already a majority minority state. Despite the fact
fact that Georgia is a majority, minority state. The map before you only has 20 majority
minority districts. And, egregiously, cracks the black population in Henry County. This
means that black districts, residents of district 17 and 25, consisting of some of the most
successful and fastest growing black communities will not be able to elect candidates of their
choice for the next decade. The 1EX map inappropriately splits communities of interests. While
the majority continues to tout the low number of counties they split, the problem is the way
the counties of split. Chatham and Bibb counties are unnecessarily split three ways.
The majority has drawn out of county legislators into these counties specifically to stack
the local delegation. Finally, the map before you is egregiously
gerrymandered by the majority party.
The voters of the state have spoken,
and they want to have a choice in November.
A yes vote on this map is a vote
to discard representative government.
A yes vote on this map is a vote
to disenfranchise millions of Georgia voters.
of yes or on this map is an invitation to costly legal challenges that will be
incurred to defend an unconstitutional map.
I ask you, don't privilege your own power above that of your fellow citizens.
People elected you in good faith.
They expect you to uphold the basic principles of democracy.
And the top halls we held around the state,
and the hearings we held in this building,
and on the online portal created on our state website,
the people of Georgia are pleading for the same thing,
a fair process with maps that actually
reflect the will of the people of this state.
This map, this rushed process,
is not what the people of Georgia are asking for
and continuing to ask for it.
Nor is it what the law demands.
I urge you to vote no.
I yield the rubel.
Chair now recognizes Chairman Rich for the Chairman's time
By rule limited to 20 minutes.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen.
We're hearing the same buzzwords over and over again.
I feel a little bit like we're eating a dead horse here.
Yes, Georgians have requested transparency.
And yes, we have given them transparency.
Not only has the legislation for the Senate
and the House maps, gone through the traditional committee
process that is open to the public with multiple opportunities
before the committee for hearings.
But we have also had 11 public hearings
for members of the public.
We have gone out of our way to make it as available
as possible for individual members to contribute
and to participate in and to observe the process.
We've heard calls for translations.
These are really not realistic demands.
Not one of these people who has proposed this
has proposed any meaningful way for us to take care
of translating into what languages,
how many languages some people have suggested six.
We don't, we follow the committee process
for this legislation like any other legislation
that comes before this body.
It is the process during which legislation is perfected.
Something else that's very concerning to me,
this Senate has been accused of targeting a senator.
Well, first of all, that is an overly simplistic analysis
of an extremely complicated process that has many layers.
Secondly, the Voting Rights Act protects communities and voters.
It protects those communities.
It ensures that communities have the ability to elect a candidate of their choice.
It doesn't guarantee me my seat, and it doesn't guarantee you your seat or any senator their seat.
The maps that the Senate has drawn comply with the Voting Rights Act.
I know this because we have worked on this process together.
We have engaged legal counsel who are experts in this field.
We are confident that the maps comply with the Voting Rights Act.
else that strikes me is outrageous is that you have members of this body who are encouraging
you to vote no because the map drawn by the Senate Democratic caucus is better.
Well, guess what?
They didn't want their map to go through the committee process.
Their map and their proposed legislation was open for public debate and commentary.
When the chair of that committee asked the sponsor of the legislation if she wanted
a vote, she declined.
They didn't even give you an option because they knew that their map was not a viable
option.
The only map that you have in front of you is the map that has gone through the committee
process and that has been vetted and perfected. And I implore you to vote yes. Anyone who votes
no is exercising a dishonest stand based on partisan politics and buzzwords. So I request
your favorable consideration. Thank you.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable

Resolution 3EX, Representative Bonner, the 72nd and others,
ratifying Governor Brian Kemp's executive orders and suspending the collection of
voter fuel and diesel fuel taxes. And for other purposes, this resolution I'm
going to refer to the Committee on Ways and Means, I committee recommends that
this resolution be adopted. Chair recognizes the governor's four-leader
representative bonner to present the bill or the resolution.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I appreciate the opportunity to present to you House Resolution 3EX, a resolution that
is a part of Governor Kim's agenda for this special session.
In May of 2021, ransomware attacks on information technology systems forced the colonial pipeline
to shut down.
This shut down led to panic at the pumps and up and down the east coast and throughout the state of Georgia.
In response, Governor Kemp issued four executive orders declaring a state of emergency due to the gas shortage and
suspending motor fuel and diesel fuel taxes in Georgia from May 10, 2021 through June 2, 2021.
Action by two thirds of both chambers of the Georgia General Assembly is necessary in order to ratify the suspension of this tax.
Our body has done this, these types of resolutions before, including in 2020, when we concurred with Governor Kim's public health state of emergency.
So that is the resolution, Mr. Speaker, and I ask for your favorable consideration, and we'll stand for any questions.
You do not appear to have any questions.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker, on the brief.
Everyone knows that we do the IRC update every year.
We're going to do it early this year.
There was a provision last year in regards
to the child tax credit that was passed at the federal level
after we got out or after we got our IRC bill done last year.
We're simply trying to get ahead of this
so that the Department of Revenue can go ahead
and start programming the software
and so that our citizens can file accurate tax returns
at the beginning of the year.
I'd urge your federal consideration of House Bill 7EX.
Any questions, Mr. Speaker?
I'll be happy.
You do not have any questions.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, the members.
Again, I'll urge your federal consideration.
