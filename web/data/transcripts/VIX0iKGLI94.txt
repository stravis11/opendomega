TRANSCRIPT
----------
you you you you Thank you so much for your patience it is that time of year where all of us are having to be in several places at one time people are coming up as people are presenting a bill in a minute and a house committee again so we figure out how that is going to work but while we have a COREm we will start it as a county start our court. May have to have you later. with you all as we get through this evening. A lot of bills in the agenda. I'm gonna ask Senator Parrot, do you wanna open this up in order, prayer? Sure. I didn't warn you. Okay. Dear Lord, thank you for looking over us today as we gather towards the end of this legislative session. We've considered so many issues already and we know that these last few days will be even more frantic. Please grant us the wisdom and guidance to do your will and to carefully consider all these issues in front of us, which are of great importance to the state and to every citizen of our wonderful state of Georgia. In your name, we pray. Amen. Thank you for doing that. And so there's sign up sheets up here for all the bills. If you wanna be heard on the bill, please come and sign up. Given the length of some of these, we will have to time your presentations. We'll probably do two or three minutes and have a timer. We don't normally do that, but with the amount of people we have sign up for some of these bills are gonna have to this evening. Otherwise, many people have also presented a written testimony to us that is in our folders as well as so thick. And so if you presented a written testimony, I'd ask that you please consider letting that speak for your testimony. Other people who did not present that have two or three minutes. But with that, we will get started with House Bill 88. Representative Gaines, we are working to give them one second to finish signing up. And take your time, finish, and sign up. I'll just go ahead and state. We are working all for LC 480948S. And this is as pass the House. We have joining him, former representative Scott Turner with eternal vigilance action. All right, representative Floyd's yours. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and appreciate y'all hearing this bill this afternoon. This legislation, the goal behind it is to try to address cold case homicides throughout our state. Try to one provide more justice for families victims, for families of victims, and then also to make sure those individuals who commit these heinous acts are put behind bars. And we believe this legislation is a positive step towards that. Right now, the GBI has over 500 cold cases with many more throughout the state with local agencies. Part of this legislation is to try to create a reporting requirement for cold case homicides. I mean, I'll briefly just walk through the three policy objectives and I'll be really brief, Mr. Chairman, because I know there's a lot on the agenda. But the first part is to give family members, immediate family members of cold case homicides opportunity by renting an application to have the case file reviewed three years after death. And if new leads are found in the case, it would be reinvestigated. It would be set the sole discretion of the agency. The second component is a reporting requirement, which I just mentioned, for cold cases, to try to make sure we get an account of how many cold cases there are throughout the state. And then finally, clarify that an unsolved homicides at death certificates can be issued with the generic homicide is a cause of death. This was an issue in the Baker case, which is one of the namesakes for the Bill Tara Baker. It took, I believe, 10 years for her death certificate to be issued, which her identity was stolen several times throughout that process. So this allows the corner, clarifies that the corner can issue a generic homicide is a cause of death. And again, dresses that issue. So those are three main policy objectives behind it. It is named for, as I mentioned, Miss Baker, who's a UGA law student who was murdered in 2001. And that's my interest in the bill. She was in Athens when that occurred. And then, Ron De Coleman, who's 18-year-old, who was murdered in 1990. Both the Baker and Coleman families have been intimately involved in this legislation and testified on the house side. But that's generally what the bill does. And if there's questions, I'd be happy to take them. And I misspoke. It is a committee substitute, if you can briefly touch on the differences. Sure. So the differences between the House at Sender, Robertson's request, it is three years since the... on how many years since the case that it would be eligible to be reviewed by the agency. Note there is still a five-year waiting period to review again. The House version had six years. The federal version is two years. So that was at Sender, Robertson's request. The... I'm trying to remember other changes. So, line 58 to line 63 was a request from the governor's office just for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. There'll be subject to the Georgia Ministry of Procedure Act. But then, sheriffs and police departments at their request are not subject to the Ministry of Procedure Act. So it will be slightly different in those two instances. And then finally, just clarifying in the funding online 125 and 126 that funding would be required at any cost incurred at the state and local level. But those are the only changes from the House and Senate version. Now, you mentioned Senator Robertson. He had a similar ability file in our side. That's right. You two work together on this. That's right. That's right. It's being the vehicle for this legislation. Any questions for the author or Mr. Turner from the committee? All right. No one else ought to speak on the bill. What's the pleasure of the committee? Move to the past. Motion to do passed by committee substitute. Senator Calzart, is there a second? Second. From Senator Setsler, any discussion? All those in favor of the motion? Please raise your hand. It is unanimous. Is Senator Robertson carrying the bill? Leave so. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Appreciate it. Thank you. Appreciate it. All right. We're doing some of this based on who is here as well on the agenda. I'm sorry. I'm here for Chairman Smith. Okay. Come on up. Representative Silcox. Let's knock out House Bill 475. This is the annual Code Revision Bill that comes to us also from legislative council. That's right. Do you want to briefly? It just, of course, reflects the work of the Code Revision Commission to repeal portions of the code that are obsolete, declared on constitutional or preempted or superseded by subsequent laws. All right. And we're working on LLC 393517, the same version passed by the House. There are any questions for the author. No one has signed up to speak on the bill. What's the pleasure of the committee? We have motion to pass from Senator Parent, a second from Senator Kennedy, a discussion. All those in favor of the motion. Please say aye. Any opposed? It is unanimous. And who's carrying that one in the Senate? Do you know if they tell you? Chairman Smith's a not telling me. Okay. We'll get that figured out. All right. While you're there, if you will move on to House Bill 500. Yes. We are working off of LC 480852. Correct. All right. The floor is yours. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I bring to you House Bill 500. House Bill 500 provides that anyone by means of fire or explosives that knowingly causes, encourages or procures another to set fire to a law enforcement vehicle would be guilty of the crime of arson of a law enforcement vehicle. Anyone found guilty of this crime would be punishable by a fine of $100,000 and or five to 20 years. There is no mandatory minimum sentence. A police vehicle course is the primary tool with which our law enforcement officers enforce criminal laws. They are equipped with specialized equipment, often bringing the cost of these vehicles to well over $100,000. These vehicles are paid for, of course, with our taxpayer dollars. And given our computer chip shortage are not easy to replace. Moreover, there are many police departments throughout Georgia that do not have backup vehicles, or if they do, they are usually older without data equipment. So that is the bill. I do have, it was brought to my attention today from PAC that the bill as it stands, as passed by the House, is inconsistent with the bill. It was inconsistent with 36-9-11. So I would offer an amendment to, whoever wants to offer that amendment, I guess you all need to technically amend it to add a section three repealing that section. So the amendment was, proposed amendment was passed out to the committee as well. Does anyone, well, they say something to speak, I'll let pros and e attorney's counsel also address that when they come up. So I have questions for the author for the underlying bill. All right, we have a couple of people signed to speak. I'm going to call up, Maisie Langerten and Jason Sheffield from Georgia Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. I'm representing for silks, so you want to step aside and let them sit there that way. We don't have a podium in here, so we have to share the table. Okay. Thank you. Of course. Thank you, Carmen Strickland and members of the committee. Good afternoon. Good evening, whatever it is. Yeah, I think it is evening. Certainly, what will be when we leave here if it's not now? Probably will be. I'm Maisie Langerten, Executive Director of the Georgia Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. I'm joined as a chairman, said by Jason Sheffield. He's one of our members practices throughout the state of Georgia and is going to bring some more direct practice experience to our testimony today. I have not seen the actual amendment language offered, though. I have had a conversation with PAC about this idea. It seems that in a recent appellate decision, the court has essentially challenged the defense bar to bring a better case raising this issue of whether 36-9-11. Conflicts with our current arson statute. Of course, we don't have arson of a law enforcement vehicle on the books right now. And frankly, we don't need to have a new law on the books right now because our current arson statute covers vehicles and damage to vehicles by arson. But PAC is coming in a proactively prophylactic way to try to avoid losing to us in court, frankly, by bringing you this amendment. Someone did try to raise this lenity argument with respect to a fire that occurred at a government building. The court has not yet decided whether a vehicle outside of a building, as far as we could find this afternoon in our case law search. We'd not find where the court has decided that a vehicle sitting outside of a building qualifies as an aperture, and I keep saying it wrong, Jason can say it properly. I'm going to blame my braces for that. But it's troubling to us that this code section that you're being asked to repeal today hasn't been addressed by this body since 1933. And if one of our defense bar members has brought a potentially innovative defense claim, and as to this date, PAC has not lost as a result of such an innovative claim. It's troubling to me that they're coming to you to ask for a remedy when the court has not interpreted this to apply to vehicles to date. And we believe it's well within the judiciary's discretion to manage that should that issue come before them in the future. But that's kind of a new wrinkle to today's conversation on this bill. I'm going to turn the mic over to Jason to address the bill as we have it otherwise. Chairman Strickland, nice to see you again, sir. Nice to see all the members of the committee. Thank you for allowing us to come today. I'd like to think of kind of the structure of the thought behind this new law as the structure of a ladder. If you think about a ladder, you want to achieve the ultimate height that the ladder will reach, but you certainly need to step on the first rung of that ladder. And I'd like to ask some questions rhetorically speaking of this committee to think about whether or not we even make it up the ladder to get to this new law. Probably a lot of the things that this committee has discussed amongst itself over time has been, do we need this law? Do we need to spend the time, the money, the resources, the paper, the hours spent in committee over this? Do we need it? Does there a law that already solves this problem? I think that's a fair question that you probably ask yourselves a lot. Number two is this the kind of law that also chips away at the discretion of our judiciary. Why do we keep taking discretion away from our judges? Do we not trust our judges to do the right thing? This law, this new law now imposes a mandatory minimum of five years. And it still recognizes judicial discretion. You don't have to put the person in prison. You don't have to give five years. So why are we taking time with another law that has already covered that divests our judges of their discretion? It also is a law that really is not going to have the impact that Representative Silcox is asking for because it still allows for behavioral and senate updates. So that five years is already going to be chipped away by the behavioral and senate updates that apply now in felony cases. And it also is going to invoke this sort of complicated conversation about the rule of lenity where you have now the arson first statute that doesn't impose a five year mandatory minimum. But it covers vehicles. So you now have two statutes that cover vehicles being burned. And so you're now going to create more time in our court system, more argument to juries, more consideration by the court, more explanation to the jury about lesser included where the jury can find the defendant guilty of a lesser included. And then to insert right now in front of this committee, the idea that we should just have you repeal another statute that's been good law for almost a hundred years, 90 years without discussion, without explanation where that law has been considered important in terms of repaying government for damage to its apprittenances, which could include a car. It could include a car. It's not really defined, but it's out there. The fine in this case is raised from 50,000 to 100,000. Mr. Chair, if I'm going to give you two more minutes, I'm going to clear right now. Thank you so much. The fine is being raised, but we're talking about the difference, you know, fine and restitution. You're going to pay restitution for the car. The fine being increased is really nonsensical in terms of it's not going to cover the cost of the car. It's going to punish the person. And what we know about the people being charged with arson is that 80% of them are indigent. And they don't have 50,000 dollars much, much more 100,000 dollars. So I would ask this body to consider these problems and to consider not moving forward on 500. Thank you very much. Thank you. Can I really briefly- I just have to say out loud that the insory minimum is, we try to be really careful about that. This is not a traditional mandatory minimum. There is discretion for the court here. I just want to clarify that. Okay. You have a question from Senator Settler. I'm pretty much a presentation. You can talk about how long this statute has been in place. I guess is we unpack this. I mean, you know, the author is not proposing a higher maximum. What's being proposed is a lower minimum. I think the underlying premise here is not just general arson, but the fact that police, for example, have a special symbolic. Not just in practice, but they also have a symbolic effect that people might target police as sort of this, particularly burning cop cars as a target of protest. Just as we have a separate framework for aggravated assault against the police officer of the firearm that we do of other persons. I'm fond of saying people should not be more weak than others, but in the case of police officers, we do provide that extra protection in other contexts. What's wrong with raising the minimum to five years from one, recognizing the uniqueness of their circumstances? Well, you have five years in that you have it now. As defined in law, you've got one to 20. So every judge in our state could decide on their own to factor in the idea that the vehicle at issue is a law enforcement vehicle versus my sedan and decide that that is warranting a more punitive sentence. So it's available right now. They certainly can't. I guess the point is that the legislature wants to wants to affirm a value judgment that the lowest it should be is five years because attacking cops, a cop car is different than just burning another car. Wouldn't the appropriate thing to be to leave the cat where it is and just lower raise the lower end. It certainly isn't a policy decision to be made. Senator Setsler and I understand that that is the purview of this body. It's just again troubling to us that we continue to find the judges being prescribed how to meet out sentences in situations where they are the ones hearing the facts of the case. There could be some facts we've had a really fun times in the house you and I having hypothetical conversations about how facts areas play out. And the judges in the better position to decide and you've given them plenty of time here. You've already given them one to 20 years. They can start at five. They can start at 10. They could give them 20. But the facts of the situation may really just warrant three even if it's a police car. So our concern about it is the way that we continue to see judges hands being tied even though this is like you said only raising the floor not preventing things like probation or deferred sentencing. Any further questions from committee members. All right. Thank you so much for being with us. Robert Smith. Thank you. Hi, Robert Smith, the Cross Community Attorney's Council. I'm the reason for the amendment and just to kind of give you a highlight and explain what happened. There's a code section and title 36 that says that basically destruction of county buildings or there are pertinences. And an apartment is an accessory or other item associated with a particular activity. If those are destroyed, it's a misdemeanor. And you have this body has passed other laws that are in conflict with that. If you think about criminal, the international government property, which is a felony, that is in conflict because government property. We already have another statute says it's a misdemeanor. And when you have two statutes with the same criminal conduct, but different sentences, then you have to go to the lower one. And that's the only thing I'm bringing to your attention and asking that if you want to let your intent show through along with along with this bill because trying to define what an apartment says, you know, a police car or the contents of a police vehicle could be argued to be an accessory associated with a particular activity. And recognize that perhaps we should wait or perhaps this, you know, the legislature can do its role in government and act decisively to send it signal to everyone else. Otherwise, I'll take questions. I would do have a question. Is that Senator Hatchett? You recognize for question. So I know the section 36 9 11 that we're, I guess, looking to repeal says damaging or destroys. Is that, I mean, if I just spray painted, I'm not advocating for this, but graffiti on the side of a government building. In that case, it would be a misdemeanor. If we repeal this, what would you use to charge someone that does that? A whole host of different things. Okay. I mean, because you've got, you've got plenty of other statutes that we could pick from. The idea is that you could be interference with government property, where it could be, I think there actually is graffiti is a, there is a separate code section for graffiti. So the question is that this is a general statute, which includes defacing public buildings. And the idea is to repeal the general and let, let all the specific legislation that this body has created over the years, control the behavior. If I can for a year, I always hear the best law is old law. And I guess, I guess what you're saying is because we have specific code section and specific statutes now to deal with destruction of property that this, I guess it's time to go because everything is covered. Essentially, you've got a big giant umbrella and all the kinds, so all the specific conduct kind of underneath it is covered by this umbrella. You know, it's my boss piece, and black is often to say there's so many walls now, it's hard to keep track. You know, total 16 has grown now to being three of our volumes. And the idea is that you've created all these specific things, but once again, in this, when there's a synancing scheme, when there's a misdemeanor synancing scheme, that's going to control over the felonies. So you can create new felonies. This statutes a good one. And if someone brings up and challenges and says to the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals, hey, a police vehicle, a sheriff's deputy's vehicle is an impertinent, and they agree with them. This statute that you just, you know, with the Senate's, the felony sentence becomes 12 months and manage and the presumption of bail rather than being a felony. And the other thing to think about is that another conversation that's had elsewhere, this law has is back from the 1800s and 1900s. And as you said, the best law is the old law, but also you have to remember in the 1930s and 1933, specifically, there weren't a lot of police vehicles. So let me just ask one last term. I just want to make sure we don't, we're not missing something. I know you, we've, we've addressed everything with, with other statutes, but with this one, I mean, would, you know, running into a police vehicle with your vehicle and maybe scratching or, I mean, is that covered? Would that be covered with the law? Or are we going to do away with that if we repeal this? And I know I'm not trying to put you on the spot. I just want to make sure we're careful before we just completely repeal a code section here. If I can respond to the question with the question. Yes. What is your intent when you're running into a police car? I mean, it could be an accident. I mean, I mean, it would not, it would not be covered by these code sections. Okay. You're basically, when you're talking about your friends with government property, there's an intentionality that you actually intend the action with this that there's an intentionality that you are trying to damage through the use of fire or an explosive device, a police vehicle. We have those, that's what I'm saying. We have this legislative body has created a lot of specific crimes, but there's this big, giant general umbrella out there that is going to take away the sentences. You say you want something to be a felony? That's great. But understand this code section could be used to make the felony conduct on this event. Okay. Any other questions from committee members? Thank you very much. Appreciate you being with us, Mr. Smith. I was the pleasure of the committee on House Bill 500. Make a motion to pass, Mr. Chair. Got a motion to pass, Senator Hatchett. Is there a second? Second. Second from Senator Setsler. Anybody have further discussion or want to propose this amendment? Who's that, Senator Setsler? Mr. Chairman, now, at the, I think it's the author's intention that this be offered as an amendment. I think it's just a friendly amendment, I think. So, at the author's request, I'd like to move the amendment to add this new section three to House Bill 500. Committee steps two. All right. Is there a second? The amendment fails for lack of a second. Okay. Back to the original bill. What's the pleasure of the committee? All in favor? Raise your hand. Here's the new amendment. Thank you. Representative Phil Cox, maybe your amendment can be addressed in the agreed disagree process if you feel like that's needed. Thank you. We're just going to keep going in order of the agenda. I think I saw.

Presented, blever, in the backroom House Bill 375. You will come on forward here and we'll let you explain your bill to us. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Members of the committee, I've treated my form. This is some more high-voltage stuff I'm bringing to you today. In certain, a definition of gross settlement in the adult conservator and guardian statute to provide currently the law is if you're 25,000, if you're as a conservator, if you're proposing to enter into a settlement for an adult person that's incompetent, and the amount of the settlement is 25,000 or less, the conservator can compromise without court approval. If it's over that amount, the conservator has to obtain court approval. There is a cross-reference to a definition, but we're replacing that with an actual definition in the code section that grossed settlement is basically everything that's paid in connection with the settlement. We're putting it in both paragraphs in the code section where it talks about the ability to compromise settlements of the adult ward. It's very technical cleanup provision. We meet for a little bit of a look trying to figure what you meant. Is this just clarifying that that includes everything? You list here the present value of a mouse to be paid in settlement, cash, medical expenses, the negation, expenses, attorneys fees, et cetera, just whatever the total recovery is? Yes, Mr. Chairman. This change was requested by a former member of the General Assembly who's now a probate judge in Chatham County and just wanted to clarify this so it would be uniform throughout the code. Were some people arguing that it only applied to a net settlement that had for a time? I think that was a concern or that the actual definition that's cross-reference was not explicit enough, and so now we're avoiding all about beyond hopefully any reasonable possibility. Any questions from other committee members? All right, what's pleasure of the committee? Got a motion to pass when President Pro Tem is there a second? Second, Senator Hodges. Okay, any discussion or proposed amendments on this one? Did you get it right coming through the House? I think we got it right coming through the House this time, Mr. Chairman. All right. Any further discussion? All in favor, raise your hand. It appears to be unanimous. Thank you for being with us. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Appreciate it. I have another one on the agenda. I'll see you. Wow. Okay. You are working it. All right. If anybody has one in Chairman Strickland is presenting the bill in a House committee, so he ducked out. I'm pinching for him. House bill 404, Representative Carpenter, Chairman Carpenter. I saw you out there somewhere. Somebody, you know, Officer Carpenter out there in the hall if you see him. I was sorry. But the one answers you out there with everything you need was a direct hit room. It's fine. I hate it. the main and . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . We have among the highest and thin and maternal mortality rates, and so this is really critical to our state. So we're in support. Thank you so much. I'm going to try another twin killing because I got two people from AVLF, Cole, Thales and Crystal Red, something like that. You all here? Come on up. Just introduce yourself and get a good thought of you, both just pass the mic when you're done. Good afternoon. My name is Cole Thaler. I'm an attorney at the Atlanta Volunteer Lawyers Foundation. For the past 14 years, I have been representing tenants in Georgia living in poverty. And I want to speak specifically on the portion of the bill that would require every property rented as a dwelling place to be fit for human habitation and urge the support of this bill for the entire content of the bill, but particularly that provision. And I want to speak on the reasons why tenants might sign a lease and move into a rental property that is not fit for human habitation. The majority of landlords in this state are reputable business owners who rent properties that are in safe and decent condition, if not excellent condition. But in my nine years at the Atlanta Volunteer Lawyers Foundation and four years at the Georgia Legal Services Program before that, unfortunately, I have encountered landlords who take advantage of their tenants by renting out uninhabitable dilapidated properties. The reasons why a tenant might sign a lease and move in to an uninhabitable property, boil down to desperation, lack of options and poverty. A VLF routinely assists clients who had no previous home address before the dilapidated property because they were homeless, sleeping in their vehicle, in motel rooms, in abandoned buildings, or in a tent outside. When those vulnerable individuals find a home whose rent they can actually afford, they have little bargaining power to demand habitable conditions before moving in. And they assist clients who are at the end of the eviction process, knowing that marshals are about to remove them from their homes, and their desperate to sign a lease with any landlord who will overlook that pending eviction. Many of these clients make the agonizing decision that a roof full of holes is better than no roof over their head at all. And finally, we assist clients whose previous rented homes were in even worse conditions than the place that they're looking at now. Most of our clients are working moms, working low-wage jobs, who are looking for the least bad option for their children. With no other affordable options, these tenants may decide that a home with faulty plumbing that leaks raw sewage is marginally preferable to a home with a severe rat infestation. If those were your only choices, what would you choose? Thank you. Crystal, you don't have a minute and a half of your aid up part of your time. Okay, no problem. Good afternoon. Thank you for the opportunity to speak. My name is Crystal Red. I'm one of the attorneys with the Atlanta Volunteer Lawyers Foundation. And I'm here specifically to talk about the right to cure a section of HB 404. Evictions have a devastating impact on vulnerable people and families. The impact includes displacement from the communities where they have support systems, educational opportunities, medical attention, religious facilities, and other support systems that help them on a day-to-day basis. And the effects of an eviction filing, just the filing itself, is long lasting as tenants with an eviction filing, will experience difficulties in applying for future housing. Moreover, they are increased costs to secure housing when tenants have an eviction on their record. As a result, tenants are forced into less secure, less safe housing options with poor conditions. Therefore, we support the requirement of a written three business day right to cure before an attorney, excuse me, before an Atlanta Lawyer can file an eviction. HB 404 will help tenants to avoid the detrimental effects of an eviction with reasonable notice of a possible eviction filing. Tinnets have the opportunity to marshal the resources from family, friends, and other types of nonprofit organizations that can provide rental assistance to help pay the owed rent or to cure any of any other lease violation. The avoidance of the eviction filing will not only help the tenants, but landlords can save time and money as they avoid the burden and expenses of filing and court, attorneys fees, and finding new tenants. Landlords will get paid without having to go to court, and tenants and their families can remain in their home. Thank you for the opportunity to speak. Thank you. And though that right to cures in this bill. Yes, sir, it is. Thank you. No questions. Appreciate it. Mr. Hayden Stanley, Georgia Department Association. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Members of the committee. I took my remarks down to what I called a short speech, but with two minutes I'll try to move more quickly than I planned. My name is Hayden Stanley. I represent the Georgia Department Association. Appreciate the opportunity to share their perspective on this legislation. Much of the energy as you've already heard of this legislation focuses on habitability and the right to cure. And in terms of habitability standards and tenant remedies, please consider the following, which is all current Georgia law. OCEGA 4472 sets up the framework of a landlord tenant relationship and provides that neither party may waive or avoid any of the following rights, duties, or remedies. And so that is 44, 713 relating to the duties of the landlord as to repairs. 714 related to the liability of a landlord for failure to repair. And they cannot waive the tenant and the landlord may not waive ordinances adopted locally, pursuant to 36, 6111, which authorizes any municipality or county to require the repair, closing, or demolition of dwellings intended for human habitation, which as defined by that local ordinance is unfit for human habitation. The landlord tenant law provides for duties, for the landlord liability for their failure to repair and elsewhere Georgia law grants government full authority to adopt and enforce these. In the interest of time, we would ask you to be very careful about expanding this bill any further. It does nothing to address crime on properties or give landlords tools to do anything about that. And I'm tapping out. So I'll give you a little bit of a lifeline then. Thanks. Do you feel like this bill is necessary or you try to you tell us that it's already covered by existing. We believe that the language on habitability at the beginning of the bill folds adequately and appropriately into current law. Current law and a warranty implied warranty of habitability permeates the entire code. And so we believe that if it needs to be stated this clearly, that is adequate. But expanding it beyond what's in there is highly problematic. And on a right to cure. You know, at the end of the day, there's already one right to cure with a tender provision where at any time within a year, a tenant can submit prior to the bill. So I don't want to submit prior to the execution of the red, I believe, but within the period after a filing can submit past rent due. And it's a complete defense of that eviction. So this is an additional right to cure. We think to the extent that this committee believes that there needs to be this additional right to cure that it should not be expanded beyond what this current bill includes. The more you do, the less flexibility property owners have to work with their residents and their tenants. Are you good with the max of two months rent for security deposit? I don't know the standard in your industry. Third in the apartment industry, at least our members, they typically do not charge up to two months in security deposits. They charge less. So maybe one of the reasons is current law on miss handling security deposits is pretty tough. It provides for trouble damages, attorneys, fees, and so forth. So you're playing pretty risky with somebody's security deposit. I will say it's been brought up to us that charity organizations or specifically affordable housing providers sometimes will provide or will be able to enter a lease with a applicant who is otherwise not qualified for that housing unit, but for creative security deposit arrangements. So in terms of the apartment association, a two month cap is not going to impact the regular course of business, but it may create problems in other parts of the industry. Thank you, Joe Senator Hatchett. You recognize for a question. Chairman, the question I have is something that you brought up a second ago where landlords have the ability or you feel like landlords may lose their ability to help a resident out. And for several years, my wife and I had rental properties in my district. We no longer have them, but a lot of times people would come that didn't have enough money to pay rent and security deposit. So what we would do is sometimes say, you pay me the security deposit. I'll work with you on the rent over the next couple months or whatever. If that is the case when somebody moves in and technically they're rent per month is zero, would I be able to charge a security deposit? Under this bill. Under this bill. Yeah, because if I'm letting them basically live for free for a couple months. I don't know how to answer that. That's the only thing I have. That's the only I'm worried about with that is I don't think it should ever exceed two months, but if you're charging somebody less or a pro rated rate to help them get on their feet, I think you still need to be able to cover your assets, your apartment with that security deposit. Yes, I understand, understand what you're saying. And again, it's that flexibility and that ability for housing provider to work with a potential resident in a way that best fits that relationship. But of the items in this legislation that that is one that may create some issues, but not for the traditional apartment industry, I represent. Senator Sassler. Chairman, appreciate you're working on this bill. This bill strikes a very careful balance as I read it. I'm certainly as a as a member of the legislature, we get lots of calls from constituents and people have been evicted and people on both sides of the question. But this careful balance you have in this bill. Isn't it true if this balance were tipped in the direction too much further towards, you know, away from landlords being able to. After some process get. Renders out of the units that are really not fulfilling their side of the bargain. Isn't it true that this could actually have the opposite impact that landlords might look at perspective tenants who might have had a little spotty history and say, you know, I can't take the risk on you. The law, the legislature's sway the law so far towards the side of tenants. The landlord actually might turn away tenants that might be struggling and might that they may be a good tenant over time that they may have a spotty history. If we swing this too much on the side on the side of what we would say tenant interests, it might have the exact opposite effect that landlords would say, you know what, I just can't take a risk on this person. I have to only rent the folks that are guaranteed iron clad tenants. If we swing it too far in the name of tenants, we actually might hurt tenants from being able to get access to decent units. Yes, sir. I believe it. I believe it could be. I just appreciate the balance. I really love what Representative Carpenter is doing. Try to make sure there's decent places for people, but this is a, it's a razor's edge we're walking on. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Jeff Latter. Do I pronounce that right? Ledford or Latter? Sorry, my hand writing is not. I'll try to keep this very brief. Jeff Latter with Georgia Realtors. This is the bill we've been obviously working with and following the whole time. We are fine with it as it exists. However, the point you bring up about the, the amount of security deposit could cause certain individuals to not be able to find a place. We've, have a group of our property managers that we were discussing this very item with. One of them indicated that removing the three that most of the time it's one month is what they do. That's the industry standard. However, he said that, you know, the three is for the rare kind of lower credit score. And that if that were taken out, he would simply just be able to provide to a certain credit score up. We had another member that indicated that below a certain amount, rather than increasing the security deposit, they simply required some type of a default insurance. So that's how they're handling that part of it. But, you know, there's a work around. Any other questions? All right. Thank you. Come on up. I can't read your hand writing. All right. I'm retired already. Sorry. That's why nobody can read anything. Let's do it. My name's Tom Tubacin. Use that microphone if you will, Tom. So we have a few of you at home. My name's Tom Tubacin. And I have a couple of rental properties here. I'm a grew up in Decatur, Georgia, but spent a lot of my time away from here. And was happy, happy, happy to finally get back in the Atlanta area 10, 15 years ago. Most of Georgia, tenant law, my understanding, landlord tenant law is covered already by this. One of the problems with raising or lowering the our ability to add another month's rent on is that we're not going to be able to rent to people who have tough credit. I'll give you a quick example. I have a property over in DeCab County. I only have three properties and I've struggled most of my life to get them together. So they'll be part of my retirement. But I have to make my mortgage payments as well. There was a couple that had been living in a hotel room that had bad credit. I'm down to a minute. Okay. But I worked with them, let them come in to this rougher house that I had it, but it was livable. It plumbing, everything worked, but it didn't look very pretty. But I gave them a very inexpensive rate, probably $500 below what I should have. And I told them I need two months credits so they have enough skin in the game for them to stick with me. A few months later, they had a problem within their family, not a few months, a year and a half later, had a problem within their family and they couldn't make the rent. So I filed with a company here in the Atlanta area on helping me have them evicted because they would not talk to me anymore and damages to the property. And in the cab county, it took four months to evict them, even though I went through all the steps. My person I hired to help me with that said, the cab county and one of the other counties were the worst in Georgia for evicting people. Obviously, I have to pay the mortgage company and so it was four months for me to just get them out of the building and now I have to rehab that quite heavily. I know I'm rambling on, but if you want prices to go up, pass this bill. All you're going to do is this is your you're you're wandering close to rent control with the next give it a couple more years will be here with rent control. If you want properties to be ruined, think about rent control. And I don't know this fine gentleman over here used to be a used to be a bad actor like me, I guess. But I work with he was living living living this place is free. It sounds like pretty good actor. But I struggle mightily to keep and I provide clean safe housing and we all do Georgia tenant law basically covers everything this bill would do. Having a building my god almighty.

If you don't have a dog house around here that's have it all you can put the dog in it, you know, so the two months limit I just I'm talking this How much do you charge folks for how many months rent do you make them put down as a security deposit in your properties? In this particular one I gave them a month free So that they could build up the security deposit of two months this but I would have should have done three or four months Because it was four months on them before I get them out But I gave them a couple months free actually for $10 a month so that they would have skin in the game and not Have a problem with me. They had a terrible credit history But I took a chance on them because they were living in a hotel room for three years at three hundred dollars a month and The lady was cooking in the bathroom for this little family and there was gun They tell me there was gunshots going off in the hotel room So I worked with them and I said this is not a very pleasant house. It's it's ugly and it's rough But it's clean and safe the plumbing work the electricity worked I put air conditionings in the windows So please don't beat us up trying to Trying to go after Bad players out there there are bad players out there go after them You don't need to change the law to do that focus on that person Any questions I Went way over the questions All right, thank you for sharing with us. This is good. Here your perspective. You good? All right I'm gonna hear a cup more but I sure would you know, I'm kind of like the Guy and it's a wonderful life when he kissed the lady when she finally didn't take her money out of the bank You know she's so happy I'd be real happy if somebody didn't feel like they had this quick Allison Johnson Okay Hey, good afternoon. Thank you. You got two minutes. Okay. I'll be I'll be quick Did all what everybody was saying in regards to health bill 404? I want to speak directly to the issue of the right to care And I want to speak as a tenant myself and also from an organization housing justice league and what we see and hear from other Tenet to cross the state of Georgia Myself I had a situation where I was in between paychecks and I was not getting paid when it was time for rent and I was missing that late day by one But my late paid by one day had I had the opportunity To make good on that I would have been able to stay in my community where I was connected to everybody My friends my neighbors and everything else that I needed in my community What that did to me was it extracted all of my other Moneys that I had because I had to pay all these fees And also made me switch my children's districts three times in one year So what that a lot of for me I was displaced out of my community not because I didn't want to pay my rent It was because I had issues paying my rent So I think that if we are really thoughtful about giving folks an opportunity to make good things will happen good for people not just for Tenets but for also landlord People that are given defaults We don't have a second chance to get decent housing. It is so much harder for us So I just want to say again that we should have an opportunity to make good not because It's not just the right thing to do it's because we are Housing people we're keeping them safe in their communities and we need this because there is an issue in Georgia and we all know this I also think that this relationship between tenants and landlords should be balanced It is an unbalanced relationship right now And so as we move closer to passing this bill We all should we all should be acceptable to People having an opportunity to make good Thank you you are right on time and no questions All right, Leslie Anderson is if I got is this Jewish Community Relations Council? It is and we you got the right bill or Okay We have a number of social Some of our organizations help with people who are in difficult spaces and so We simply stand in the support of this bill and help you guys will support it You feel it's balanced and allows for people to have some safe places to be Thank you so much and for your brevity Lindsey Segal Lowne Legal Aid Society Love you Whitney Griggs Come on in there I'll go really fast my goal is to beat Skies timer My name is Whitney Griggs. I'm the health policy analyst with Georgians for a healthy future We know that housing is an important social determinant of health and that healthy housing leads to healthy people we also know that evictions lead to an increase in all-caused mortality So we are in support of this bill for increasing the health of Georgians. Thank you All right, thank you Kathleen Tehan if I got you right Georgia AIDS Coalition. Yes, I way Thank you. We love you Karen Cloud Georgia Apple Seed So each of you should have in your folder a memo from Georgia Apple Seed along with some suggested language We are in support of this bill We think it's a groundbreaking groundbreaking bill for Georgia that has the potential to improve lives of tenants All across the state We do just ask that you consider two changes what's The definition the current draft has the definite does not have a definition for fit for human habitability It's not clearly defined in Georgia law And we believe that courts would have to look to local ordinances for definition leaving leaving it very vague and Leaving landlords and tenants at risk of arbitrary court rulings And so we would just ask that you consider the language that that accompanies our memo Which is a list of more specific requirements all right And that language follows Alabama Florida in Tennessee and then under section 5c regarding the notice to vacate an eviction for fees We believe that Edition will create significant housing instability for families and result in unjustified evictions And written leases commonly already categorized fees oh by landlord's rent And so we just would recommend that you strike late fees utilities and charges But again, you've got the memo and the suggested language and we thank you and again support this bill. Thank you. Thank you I know I got a question for you Senator Hatchett In my district there are a lot of people who are tenants at will If if you have a friend that just lives in a house next to yours or in a trailer next to your house um, and I know current Georgia landlord tenant Law requires 60 days notice to evict for tenancies at will with this bill I the way that I'm reading it is that 60 days is the pre eviction notice and this Could essentially cut that down to three before you file an eviction. Is that how y'all are reading this? No, I mean do we need to address it and say in all cases except for at will tenancies? I just I'm I have several people that call them office and in just the other day somebody called about wanting to kick somebody out of an apartment that they were living in He was actually letting his dad stay there and his dad had a friend that was living with him his dad passed away And then they were trying to kick the friend out Um, and and there's no lease and I know the at will without a lease it their handled a little bit differently But that is yes, that is a case but this um specifically covers those where there is a lease agreement Um, so you could add in that part although we do not think it's necessary Because the law would be silent and the law would not change for the at will tenancies Even though it says in all cases This is in all cases where there is a lease Okay, you can right now tell somebody to get out and then go down to the courthouse What this is saying is that you can tell them and then give them three days right to cure the failure and If you want this clarification amendment that would be fine But we do not believe that this law changes existing Processes for the 60 days notice Okay Can if I can't miss chairman can can you or somebody point to me where this only applies to those what I mean just for my Personal satisfaction here to make sure it only applies to those cases where there is a lease Chairman Corpner. I'm sure you've got that memorized my now It is yeah, it's a contract lease license or similar agreement oral or bit What what line number 16 and the oral would be a tenancy at will correct No, that would be like a silence yeah silence I Paralyze Get get near that microphone Sorry Lindsey Segal with Atlanta legal a this the 60 day at will notice that's to terminate a tenancy without cause So that's for a tenant who's not violated the lease not behind on their rent if they violated the lease or behind on their rent The 60 days does not apply so that's just somebody who has been living in a place Let's say they're lease expired and you continue to let them live there without a lease you have to give them 60 days notice to terminate that lease And then and then you can file an eviction after that this would add another three days on to that But that's for no cause eviction okay, thanks. So this is just for four cause evictions. Okay. Thank you Senator Kennedy Thank you, mr. Chairman. I'm assuming this applies to Longer term level or tenant relations. Does it apply to Airbnb Type rentals or short term rentals? Okay, so You know, I don't think that this is applying to short term rentals If this is where you actually have a lease in place like a long term But is there a minimum time associated with thought long term lease? That's a that's a good question we can find out the answer right? Yeah I mean, I'm part of my thinking is for some of these Little Airbnb huts that you can rent. They're not gonna have air conditioning right And maybe we need to look at this through the lens of that And the other requirements Excuse me. I definitely Yeah, I think that this is definitely geared towards folks who are in at least a six-month lease or more Where they you know, they are considering the the the residents this is their main residents And what would be the basis for that six-month reference? Where's the reference point that we can look To see that that is what puts us into The mode of looking at these changes Well, yeah, we probably would need to go to the code for that Yeah, but we can find that we can we can get that the clarity around that language to you. Okay Thank you Yeah The the difference between a short-term rental and a landlord tenant relationship is whether somebody is making it their dwelling place So if they're making it their dwelling place if they've lived their long term if they've established a residency there Even if without a lease then they're a tenant But in that situation a short-term rental that person is not a tenant. They have another home They're there for vacation This would not apply to them at all and so none of these changes apply to Instances where it's not your dwelling place. That's correct. Okay. Thank you Senator Sassler Yeah, the question I want to address the question the attorney to spoke If we wanted to address Senator Hatchett's concern about at will leases in the context this what I don't want to be guilty of is we're hurtling towards emotion on this and there's something we need to address I mean I think I need to defer to to Senator Hatchett the at will lease issue seems like something we need to address while we're in this code section Which is that do you agree with that? Do you think we're okay? Are you convinced by what you read? We're okay I'm convinced by the testimony that that would only apply if you if you want to terminate the lease without cause as long as That's accurate. I'm good moving forward without addressing that will Good issue All right Thank you. That's all the questions. I have one name. I'm not sure if I can even read it. Is there an Ian Robbins? I thought it might be come on your last witness I If you would just sit in front of that microphone Absolutely make it really brief okay, but first of all are you here to address us or ask the author a question? Would let you go either way you got two minutes actually I'd like to address you because you're going to be Changed in the law so I would like to ask for the order and that is in the security deposit part of the bill It went from three months to two months. I would like to specifically ask to approach you brought back to three months Okay, that's my request and the reason is Something you had brought up something you had brought up and the word is cost Does anyone here? There's quite a few attorneys behind me is quite a few people who go through procedure The cost of an eviction could be easily $10,000 So I get it. It's very hard for someone to survive in the house But the landlord once that person is in that house Now we have a liability Because they can't pay it's better to have an empty house than have somebody who's not paying We can't get any rent from someone who's not paying If we have a security deposit the benefit to a security deposit and to benefit to this committee is the Georgia law presently Accounts for triple damages and therefore if I mess around with their money or any other landlord that represents me I only own ten properties that's it But there's hundreds and thousands of landlords in Georgia who own just a few properties If they can't pay their mortgage Now it could cost $10,000 to get someone out legally so my question to you sir and I have highly respect Do you understand the cost one word of an eviction for a guy like me Absolutely absolutely. I mean so I would my question from a rebel to you would be Have your team properties how many of them what do you what's your typical deposit right now more than two months and I get a hundred calls per week on my properties You're welcome to come watch the repair properties. It's not about habitability. I repay my properties very well My tendons stay with me even average of five to six years They usually go out by house But when you get a hundred calls a week That's it. We're on far along. What's that that's your time or not a far along That's my time did you say yeah go you finish answering the question, but did you do they answer your question? So I get it that there's a lot of people that can't afford it But if they can save up and I can give them a chance for someone marginal I could let them be in my house because if something happens it's their money. I put their money aside You're welcome to look at my security deposit no activities zero But when I need to use the money legally and I can document it I get to legally get them out and Three months two months doesn't come close to my costs and I speak for many many landlords The costs are nowhere close to two months. Please change it to at least Well have my little sign here go back to the maximum no maximum But at least three months is my request all right. Thank you very much being with us That is all the people signed up to speak. I'm not inviting any further to volunteer What is the pleasure of the committee? Make a motion to pass We got a motion to pass Senator parent is there second second from Senator Jones has already whip any discussion or proposed amendments Got a Recognize you I just want to get sense the committee. I don't want to move so fast that we miss something I I'm You know What the gentleman said is persuasive to me. I don't want most folks to have to post three months security I'd like I'd like it to be something less than that But from the perspective of real cost out there This is a statutory maximum that for no matter what the circumstances are will not exceed the number we pass in this committee I just wanted to get a sense of the committee is the committee comfortable to or the committee members Just as a whole Interthink-3 is the appropriate move for us. I just wanted before we move on on the final vote. I wish want to sense the committee Nobody's lights are live. We do have a light Senator I just thank you, miss chairman. I'm just wondering do we have any information about the person the number of evictions or the percentage of evictions as opposed to time period that properties in Georgia read it to try to get some some some Feeling for the actual cost the gentleman was talking about obviously it can cost $10,000 for eviction, but you know how many evictions do we have so I would say that the biggest issue on evictions at this point It's what you heard the gentleman that came up and spoke about the cab county foot in county Cobb County these things are lasting out for nine 10 11 12 months I think that's something that that is a body in the house in the Senate We definitely need to address moving forward not in this particular legislation But we're going to have to figure out way to hold the cities and counties feet to the fire on getting these folks out of there Because at the end of the day if people aren't paying rent and living there It's just going to raise the cost up on the people that are paying rent and it's going to have the funds to fix their property up Because you've got you know people that aren't that are living there not paying rent So I think there that is a discussion for another day for sure Okay, you just answered my question which was does your bill address that at all Mr Senator Sassler you're still recognizing that was just the point out for the committee members is if the common practice in Some large counties is four months Is capping in it too fair because I mean anything we do that we put we put a put a cap on And listen I speak of somebody that I'd love to have landlords only asked for a month or two But we put a statutory maximum. There's no Whereas however is it's it is a cap And if the fact is four months is the fact then that the people who are renting you have to get recovery from somewhere And do we do better to get it to three and then if it does compress down to last time then maybe we could drop it at two in the future But if the reality is three to four months in some places why would we make it to Senator Hatchett you recognize this a little unusual to pull the committee in the middle of a meeting But since we're in discussion phase if anybody wants to chime in on that Now's probably a good chance senator Hatchett you're recognized either for a question of the sponsor or else if you'd like to make any comments during the discussion phase here Thank you, miss chairman and my question is more toward for the author um Security deposit does that include pet deposit or is that is that a difference so no that could be under pet fee I mean this doesn't discuss fee structure right it just says deposit so Obviously if you have a pet fee a parking fee it would not include not being included in that deposit and I completely understand the intent of the bill is to protect tenants from these Agree just security deposits, but just having Apartments before and like I said working with people and lowering rent Um, I just want to make sure we're not putting landlords in the bad and sure yeah, yeah understand I think I think that in any of the day it's a it's a balance it's a balance between landlords and tenants rights Are you you're probably taking a piece a little bit away from the landlords there um, and you're giving it over to the tenants in this bill I think it's a fair measure. I think three three months was a little much I felt that way early on in the conversations especially since the industry practice is is one month I thought two was just you know, it was a fair compromise if you will from the original legislation and If I can miss chairman who ready? This would not prevent a landlord from asking for first and last months rent up front correct That's right. That's what that's and that was my thinking you know moving into college Where you really damaged property. Yeah, it was always you learn on college age boys. That's right Yeah, I can so it was first and last month rent when I was in Georgia and then they definitely got took on that Unfortunately, but I think that was the practice that I'm used to and I think that's how I balanced it in my head if you will Senator Kennedy you recognize? No, he has the question. Okay. Thank you All right, that's all the questions. So what's the pleasure of the committee and you're free to Propose an amendment if you'd like to after this We got to have a motion to pass first in a second We got him all right you want to propose a amendment senator satsal Sure, and I say this is personally my heart is it is is with tenants I get calls state representative all the time people I just I could go on and I went up time to hear hear of the work Hear the horror stories. I just I'm concerned as a legal maximum of two months it just seems like a circumstance The gentleman described I think would be wiser to to make that three I'd like to Remove the word to online 28 and then replace that with the word three is it a minute is there second Second the senator Hodges any further discussion? No, that's all right senator parent Thank you. I'm no housing expert But I do want to point out that it's a carefully struck balance here as we've heard and That the challenge with allowing that in addition to the industry standard being one month the challenge with allowing three is Many instances you're talking about folks that simply do not have that kind of money And therefore when you when you allow it what you then end up talking about which one of our speakers began mentioning as you're talking about people who have to get into things like payday loans title ponds and other very high APR loans which then traps them that much more easily in a cycle of debt that they basically can never escape from and the amount of fees and check cash fees and and all these other things paid by folks that are living on the The margin like that the figures the paid by those folks in American society are in the billions and billions and billions of dollars which basically traps them From being able to get housing and raise their children's table housing Which is why I say there's two sides to that There's two real sides to that charging more also extract of allowing longer in terms of months also extracts a big societal cost So my plea would be let's leave this careful balance the way it is not upset the opportunity On that and go forward with this modest step that the author has proposed Thank you Mr. Chair if I could if I could chair just a room that too I think you need to be real careful too when you put them when you throw three months out there in code Then the needle moves to three months So then you start waking people's eyes up to heck I'm not charging three months. I'm only charging a month Demand is it all time high housings at all time low stock and you're giving them You're giving them a dark board. They didn't know existed before So I would I would challenge you to be thoughtful in that process and it was it was taught we talked through that in In house judiciary and I and I agree I think you're creating a new target if you put three months And and obviously the there's there's concern with other languages from the tenants right folks and they won't more They want more on other issues, but we're saying we're not you know This is a balance and and that was a balance for another piece if you will Senator Strickman This thing I agree with what the author said I agree with senator parent. I mean look We're not we're not doing rent control with this bill and we're not capping with somebody can charge some I for rent but we're now we're getting into situation where people there living mop to moth are gonna be asked to pay Three much rent in advance and I think you're gonna make it really hard people to afford housing in our state with this And I do think you're now saying a new precedent. I think you are as you said the author said Now you're gonna put in code this three-month figure He may take a bill that's meant to strike a balance and actually go the other way now with this make it harder folks to Have housing in our state also want to comment as the chair Most bills people come to you on each side Leading up to this is hard with with house bills because you have a two-week period for 31 bills in our committee And on this bill I heard from a lot of people and it seemed like everybody I heard from said We struck the balance we gave something We and there were some groups even as a Friday were still trying to make changes and they came back and see you know what We struck a balance. Let's leave it where it is So I would encourage the committee to leave the bill as it is Let's strike that balance with this and we could always come back next year if we did do something to stetra mill in our state. Thank you Senator Ritt Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was just gonna say that the average rent is about $1,500 a month three times 15 is about $4,500 As a deposit and I'm still trying to get $50 back from Senator Jones from when he stayed at my place last week Good luck with that. Senator Kennedy Senator Kennedy you're recognized. Thank you, Mr. Chairman Representative, maybe I was confused is there not a maximum number of months for security deposit now and no there's not it's first time. Okay, so it's unlimited now But you know, it's currently unlimited. It's currently unlimited, right? But it's kind of like it's it's out there in space and then you're starting to put a target on it Right and what do people do typically when there's a target? They start aiming for the three and that was the concern When it when when the first bill dropped and it was three months that was you know That was the plea and committee was you're gonna create something that people are gonna converge to instead of Letting the market because currently with unlimited the market determines it most people are at one month Because that's what people kind of forward But if you in a in the demand sector that we're in with housing right now They could move it to three months and it'd be in trouble And I follow that and I think I understand that But the market could do that now currently since there's no limit on it, right? Yeah, well, absolutely landlors could charge three months currently Yeah, that's right. If the if the market was stood that or they could charge two months Sure, if the market was stood that Yeah, no, I would agree with that I still think you see people would would see that and say oh, I've left a little money on the table I mean, I think you I think you'll have that yeah You may be right except for the fact that we're putting this is a maximum So it's put us a ceiling on it. It's not a recommendation It's not a indication of what the market is We're saying as a legislature. This would be the ceiling on which you could put sure. Okay. Thank you Senator Hodges Thank you, miss chairman. I would just comment that As the gentleman who testified of you meant minutes go about his cost of eviction if If a two-month security deposit does not cover the cost of eviction Then you know what landlords are gonna do. They're gonna go up on their rent. I mean, there's no free lunch here So the you know, we can settle on two or three, but um, you know, the There's always there there is no free lunch and and

People on property are going to recover their cost. I agree with you. All right. All in favor of the settler amendment to raise that maximum security deposit to three months, raise your hand. Got four yes votes, all opposed, like sign. Four. I should turn the mic back up. I'm not going to interfere with the hard fault compromise that I think there's a lot of thought in. This can be addressed on the floor. I will vote no to the amendment. Thank you. So the amendment fails five four. And now we'll take up the motion do pass. This is as pass the house, all in favor, raise your hand. And it appears to be unanimous. Thank you guys for your third discussion. Care you're building in the soon. I think that's tough stuff. Senator Huffstatt will make another that. Thank you. Thank you guys. All right. I'm enjoying my time in the hot seat. It's back to you, Mr. Chairman. One thing you had some experience. All right. If we can come back to order, we still have several bills to get through. And as long as we can keep a core and we will keep going. I know people have places to be. So if we lose the core, then we lose the core and we'll stop at that point. When I was upstairs, Senator Calzot, I was presenting to a house committee. And I said, just so you know, a left Senator Calzot in charge. Long y'all keep me here. Long he's going to be in charge. They all laugh and they can't wait there 45 minutes. So they actually liked you in charge. We are going to House Bill 30. Representative Carson. We are working off of LC 49141 to S. And like the last bill, Fairbicke, please come to order. Like the last bill, we have a lot of folks to speak. And it is pretty even on the number. What I'm going to do so we can get through this bill is cap the time for 20 minutes for, 20 minutes against. And so we will go down based on where you signed up to speak. That will not, the author will get separate time. I'm just going to ask you to obviously get to the point in your presentation. I've done it enough. I think I can do it quick. And then we'll get to the speakers and then I will start the clock. We will do the pros and then we'll do the cons. And we will start the clock. And then so if you, as I call your name, if you want to defer to someone else or if you presented a written testimony, you can also reference that as well. So with that, represent Carson and floor yours. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. This is a House bill 30. This is very similar to House bill 1274, which we talked about and what your committee graciously passed, passed, passed near unanimously in 2022. What this bill does is codifies a definition of anti-semitism, the international Holocaust remembrance alliance or better known as Ira. I have copies. Paul's per second. Sure. We don't necessarily ban posters and so everybody has raised posters up. If you can please take them down when someone is speaking though. Just at a matter of respect, we see your posters, but you're welcome to have them up when someone's not speaking. But okay, thank you. I appreciate your cooperation. Go ahead. Thank you. We have copies of the definition, per Ira, but I think many people that are on this committee are familiar with this subject, but I'm happy to distribute these, Mr. Chairman. All this bill does is ensure that when analyzing the intent behind illegal discriminatory actions that target the Jewish people, whether it's a hate crime or discrimination, and there's an allegation that the action was motivated by anti-Jewish to sentiment, the relevant authorities consider it as rebuttable evidence, the world's most accepted definition of anti-semitism. This particular definition has already been adopted by 1100 separate governments, NGOs, and other key institutions. It's been adopted by our past and statute, past and statute by about six states, maybe seven states, Arkansas being most recent, two other states in prior versions, Florida and South Carolina, and about 22 states by resolution. This bill does not limit free speech in any way, and I would just point to the committee lines 30 through 35 of the substitute. It's going to be the bill as past the House. Why is this bill necessary as a question I get quite a bit? I'm sure other speakers can speak to that, but what I would say is that the Jewish identity is complex and it's multifaceted. It contains aspects of religion, race, culture, national origin, and ethnicity. And without a standard definition, then anti-semitists are going to hide behind the ambiguity, and you'll hear some various examples of that very soon. There's a number of groups in support. I'm not going to go through, I'm sorry. I'm not going to go through all the groups in support. This is a letter of support. I hope every member of the committee has this in their packet, and maybe in black and wider color, I don't know. But what I would encourage you to understand and implore upon you is that the Jewish community supports this bill, probably 95% plus. There are a loud group of people in the minority, and very much the extreme minority that oppose this bill. But having said that, the Jewish community is very much in support, and you'll hear from the General Assembly's only Jewish legislator if it's the indulgence of the chair and the committee. With that, I'm happy to go into more details. I think we've covered this issue last year, and I'm happy to let one of my co-speakers speak if you like, or we can take questions. What would you like members of do you have anything you want to add? Answer questions as they come up. Okay. Let's do this. We'll start with questions, because I think if your speakers for the bill, I'll not to count that towards the 20 minutes. So let's start with questions for the author, authors, you're the author as well, of the bill first. Any questions in the committee? Okay. No questions at this time. I do have a couple of amendments that I think would improve the bill. I think this was handed out in senior packet. One, one a minute, AM 490102. What this basically does is strike the word that's online 14 of advisory definition. We went back and forth about this in the House Judiciary. It's technically called, excuse me, what? It's technically called in the Ira definition here that I have in this printout. It's called a working definition. There's some consternation about that. So we're just rather than working whether it is an advisor, we're just calling it a definition. What's key here is that we're not subjugating our legislative authority. We're referring to a definition adopted by an internationally recognized authority that Georgia is not subject to unless we adopted and coded, but we're adopting the definition as of May 2016. We're not subjugating. It was have some floating definition out there. And Mr. Goldfutter can speak more to that. And we're locking in the definition, locking in those words as of May 2016. I just wanted to stress that, Mr. Chairman. We have two proposive amendments. I see in our folder. Yes. I have AM 4902 and AM 4904. Those two? Yes. I'm sorry. It's catching up to you. And the second one, AM 4904, there's a request to strike the language of the actual definition and go to a definition by reference. And the reason being is because we don't want either in this legislative session or in future legislative sessions to invite people to attack the definition that is adopted by Ira. We want to refer to it as adopted by the federal executive order done by the president in 2019. You can see the number right there at 13899 for the purposes of enforcement of Title VI of the Federal Civil Rights Act of 64. And we're making the definition a little bit more solid out here. I think here in this amendment, because we're referring to the federal executive order. Okay. Any questions on that? You don't have any questions at this time. I was going to yield some time of the 20 minutes, Mr. Chairman, to Mr. Mark Goldfutter, who can speak to why do we need to do this? And why? Include by definition. Here's what before you do that, what I'm going to do then is I have people signed up pro and con. And so I'm going to start with the pro and I'll start with you, Mr. Goldfutter. And then I'm going to warp my way down the list. And so we're going to have a clock in 20 minutes. And so if you can, please be respectful for those who want to speak after you. You can come out of time for each kind of following some of your house rules. Which I'll do on the floor. That way we have equal amount of time for everybody to speak. So with that, I'll let you two step aside so we can have folks come up and we'll stop the clock in between people switching out here and we will start with Mr. Goldfutter. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Mark Goldfutter. I'm special counsel of the American Center for Law and Justice. And as the general counsel for all the halales in Georgia, I represent over 70. And I want to start with what the bill does not do. It does not criminalize anything. It does not create a protected class. It does not chill any speech. I know there's a lot of opposition here on this bill. I want them to rest assured. It's not a he said she said debate. The bill is in writing. It does not affect speech. It is only triggered by an unlawful act of discrimination or a hate crime. In two years, the opposition has not come up with a single theoretical case in which this bill, as drafted, could be used to silence speech. Let me be clear. Anyone can protest and yell and criticize and demonstrate and speak and scream anything they want about Israel or just about Jews. This bill would not touch them unless anyone is planning to commit a hate crime or an unlawful act of discrimination against a Jewish target. This bill should not affect them. If anyone comes and sits here in opposition and tells you that they are concerned about speech, please ask them to be specific on how this bill was triggered. What unlawful act or hate crime triggered the concern. Now in a recent op-ed, the opposition admitted in writing, they don't actually think that HB30 criminalizes anything. They said their concern is about the chilling of speech. They're legally wrong. This is a unanimous Supreme Court decision. It is in your packet and the relevant parts are highlighted, explaining that it does not chill speech. I'll read you just a couple of the sentences. The first amendment does not prohibit the evidentiary use of speech to establish or to prove motive or intent. The sort of chill and vision there is far more attenuated and unlikely than that which is contemplated in overbreath cases. That's just how anti-discrimination laws work. Now why do we need this bill? We need HB30 because anti-semitism is on the rise across this country and across this state. We need HB30 even though we already have a hate crime statute because as Representative Carson said, Jewish identity is so multifaceted it incorporates aspects of religion, race, culture, national origin that without a standard definition for authorities to turn to, to use as a reference, it is easy for anti-semitists to commit acts of anti-semitism and then hide behind that ambiguity and say it was an anti-semitism because it didn't involve this or that protected characteristic. For example, just a couple of weeks ago, two Fridays ago, a man in New York was on trial for federal hate crimes. South M Assad attacked three different Jewish men on three different occasions. His lawyers in court argued that these were not anti-semitic acts. They said he assaulted them because, and I quote, for his social and political goals. In your packets, I gave you the story with links to the actual court filings. Now in this instance, prosecutors submitted his text messages where he reminded his friends to use the word Zionist instead of Jew so they could avoid the charge of anti-semitism. But even if that particular farce had not been exposed, the fact that lawyers feel comfortable arguing in open court that attacking a Jew because you don't like Israel is okay and is not anti-semitism is exactly why we need this definition and why this definition does include examples where anti-Zionism can cross the line and anti-semitism because again, no matter what you think or say about Israel and you can think or say anything you want, this bill has nothing to do with speech. We should all be able to agree that you cannot discriminate unlawfully or commit a hate crime against the Jewish person because of those opinions. But it's not always about Israel. You can hear testimony from a child from Fulton County who was terrorized for two years. In my written testimony, I sent you pictures of the actual swastika's carved into his locker in Fulton County. Along with the words, gas the Jews and kill the Jews. You'll hear from him. He nearly committed suicide after his school administration gaslighted him for 18 months and told them that what he was experiencing was not anti-semitism. The swastika has nothing to do with the Jewish religion. Of course, there are six million reasons why swastika is anti-semitic and a million and a half of them were children. But the school didn't see it that way because there was no definition. The school did this for years until the federal Department of Education had to step in and threaten their accreditation and their funding. That's why we want to adopt this definition with this amendment. We want our definition to be the exact same as the Department of Education. The same one that Department of Education uses. In the House, and I'll conclude, in the House, the opposition falsely testified that the Department of Education stopped using the IRRE definition to process their discrimination claims. That is false. I have a, I brought the receipts. I have an email here from the US Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights, confirming that of course they do use this definition to deal with discrimination when it involves anti-semitism. They also implied that the US ambassador against anti-semitism, Deborah Lipstad, is not a fan of the definition. Here is one of many public statements, a tweet endorsing it. And finally, I just want to be clear, there is no debate that the vast majority of Jewish people in and out of this state support this definition. In the list that you have, there are representatives of over 90% of organized Jewry in Georgia in support of this particular bill that is more than a consensus, it is a mandate. So H.P. 30 does not outlaw anything. It doesn't protect Israel. It protects Jews here from anti-semit, including those who would use Israel as an excuse to attack Jews. And so I ask you to please clear the noise around this bill. Don't let people make it something that it is not. And please vote in favor of H.P. 30. Thank you. All right, we'll stop the clock and see if anybody has any questions. All right. Thank you. So going back to the list, we're still on pre. We have 13 minutes and 52 seconds. We're going to go to Peter. Is it Korman? It is. I'm going to see to Wayne Jordan from Colorado's Georgia. What I'm going to have to do is I'm going to go in the list. And so if you can see your time, I'm going to go to the next person on the list, okay? And so do you want to see your time? I'll be very brief. Okay, come on up. I just want to keep us on track based on who signed up. We'll abridge two minutes and hopefully 20 seconds. All right. Fine, go ahead. You're good. I'm Peter Korman, Senate District 14 in support of H.P. 30. Very quickly, some people claim this bill will open a Pandora's Box for all different groups. The FBI reports that 57% of all religiously motivated hate crimes are targeted at Jews. Jews comprise about 2%. Thank you for the help, John. Jews comprise 2% of the population. So it's our contention that there is very strong evidence that Jews are already receiving very special and destructive treatment. All of this is referenced in my testimony. We have a group here who is put out a toolkit who has brought signs. The same group, target Jews at Emory very recently putting flyers threatening them on the doors which had mazeses, not on the doors which did not have mazeses, as a protest against Israel. This language specifically says you can criticize Israel, but you can't collectively criticize Jews for the actions of Israel. As J.P. did that, they are in this room. This is their toolkit. Let's thank you for your testimony to the bill itself. Try to give you all some latitude, but let's be respectful and keep it to the bill itself. Absolutely, Chairman. Thank you very much. All right. Any questions in the committee? All right. Next person on the list is Rabbi Albert Slohmott. Oh, it was something. I don't know if that was close, actually. Come on up, Rabbi. I have 12 minutes. Thank you. I'll be brief. I brought my Navy shoulder boards to show everybody. This represents a wonderful 20-year career I had in the Navy. The stripes are my rank and on the top of the tablets of the Ten Commandments in Hebrew on the top of that is the star of David. I joined the military to fulfill my patriotic duty, which was triggered by something I learned as a teenager. In 1790, a Jewish congregation from Newport, Rhode Island sent General George Washington a letter on his becoming president. He responded to them with a message of hope. The children of the stock of Abraham who dwell in this land continued to merit and enjoy the goodwill of the other inhabitants. While everyone shall sit in safety under his own vine and victory, and there shall be none to make them afraid. It was the last phrase that motivated me to serve. There shall be none to make them afraid. Sadly today we are indeed afraid. I'm the Rabbi up at one of the rabbis at H. H.M. in Marietta. When I come to this synagogue, I have to get the okay of the police officer to let me in and make sure the building secured. When we have a big service, we have two police officers. We have added increased security on the outside and have instructed our congregants on the emergency exits and what to do. That is not fulfilling this requirement that we're not afraid. When I tell this to my Christian clergy friends, they look at me and they say, what are you talking about? We don't have people guarding us, we're only a big crowd, Christmas and Easter. This bill's passage will help make us less afraid. I'm the founder of an organization called the Jewish Christian Discovery Center. Can somebody bring me my star, Betsy? During the Hanukkah Christmas season, I visit churches and hand out packets. Each contains a star of David that we ask families to place on the Christmas trees. Thank you. I need the star. Thank you. The receiver card which explains that Jesus celebrated Hanukkah and not Christmas and that he lived and educated and spiritually. Thank you, hidden, fulfilling Jewish life. So this is what we ask for kids to put on the trees. Now one of the kids said to me, if Jesus was Jewish, what religion were Joseph and Mary? I said, what do you think? Within a few seconds she said Jewish. Immediately another one asked, what about Paul? Jewish too. I said, I'm finishing a big finish. I then asked the first student, now that you know that Jesus, Joseph, Mary and Paul were Jewish, what does that mean to you? She was silent for a minute, then looked at me with a grin on her face and said, I guess it means we're all a little bit Jewish. And we really are. And the poison of prejudice affects one group one day, then it goes to another group, then it goes to another group, then to another. When we act against Jews, we act against the whole body of Christianity as well. Let's not let that happen. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Any questions for the rabbi? All right. Thank you. And I have stars. I've bought a first week. All right. Thank you. Next we have Cheryl and I cannot read your last name. All right. Thank you. Beth, is it gone? Yeah. Gann? I want to start doing the E.C. We have eight minutes, 51 seconds still. Okay. I just want to make sure I'm like myself. That's what I'm being. He can break. That's fine if you want to, he also stopped to speak. He's right behind me. Okay. Aaron. Yeah. Do you have what you're doing? He's next on my list. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. I need glasses. Okay. So you want me to go first? I'll go first. Okay. Good afternoon, honorable committee members. My name is Beth and I stand in front of you or sit in front of you today and I to discuss the definition of anti-semitism and why it's so important. He's actually a twin and both of my boys were terrorized with anti-semitic gestures and swastikas. This went on for 18 months. I was told that this was a piece symbol. Clearly that is not a piece symbol. Can you hold it for that? We were told it wasn't a piece symbol. I wasn't taking seriously until the Department of Justice and the Department of Education and the Office of Civil Rights contacted us and they told the county and the state if they couldn't figure out how to handle this then they would do it for them and take away the accreditation. My situation escalated to death threats in physical violence assaults at school and so I had to pull the kids out. Our case is now known as the worst case of anti-semitism in the schools in the history of the state of Georgia. It seems obvious that this killed the Jews as anti-semitism but unfortunately this still is going on today. Because there's no definition the school was afraid to act, the state, the police could not act. If there was a definition of clear there would not be a question of what this was and how to act. I stand before you today to encourage the definition to that my family, no other family has to endure what we did. I would ask you to vote in favor of HB30 so our family suffering was not in vain. All right, thank you. You want to go? Sure. All right. Can you hear me? Yes, we got you. Good afternoon honorable members of the committee. My name is Aaron and I'm testifying today in favor of HB30 based on my own personal experiences with anti-semitism. As my mother pointed out I was terrorized at my school for nearly 18 months findings was because painted in the restroom and other graffiti such as quote, kill the Jews and quote and gasages. Occasionally I also had students surround me at my locker and throw money at me while screaming, jume down in my face. I believe this wouldn't have happened. There have been a definition of anti-semitism. I went to everyone I could, teachers, staff, social workers and even the principal. And what I was told was that what I had found was not anti-semitic. Rather it was a piece simple and that the other graffiti amounted to nothing more than students pulling pranks. The graffiti appeared on a near wiggly basis and it got so bad to the point where I contemplated suicide. I was only 13 at the time and ever since I had been in therapy. If there was a definition there would have been no doubt as to whether or not the graffiti I was finding was anti-semitic. It could have ended in one day, not 18 months. Such a definition would not allow an action. But as painful and traumatic as this experience has been for me, I'm here today because I don't want this to happen to anyone else. Not everybody has friends and family who recognize the signs of suicide. But I was fortunate enough too. So please, to encourage that no one ever has to go through anything like what I had to go through and the unimaginable trauma that came with it and to ensure that everyone has a safe learning environment or work environment or any environment for that matter where they don't have to worry about being targeted because of who they are. Please, please, please vote in favor of this bill. Thank you for your time. All right. Thank you, Aaron. Thank you for being so brave to tell your story. I think even probably those that are against the bill would agree that's unimaginable what you went through and everybody thinks you're brave for being willing to come share your story. So thank you. Any questions in the comments? Any questions in the committee? So y'all are good. You can leave the hot seat. Thank you. All right. We still have five minutes and 16 seconds left. Next, Simone Wilker. I guess I can say good evening now. Almost good night. Thank you for inviting me to speak. My name is Simone Wilker and I'm here today as a Jewish woman and also as a member and leader of Hadassah, the woman's Zionist organization of America. Hadassah is the largest Jewish woman's organization in the country with over 300,000 members. And here in Georgia we have over 5,500 members. I don't want to repeat what everyone has said here because we are absolutely in favor of the bill. And Hadassah as a national organization has passed a policy statement in favor of the Ira resolution. So we are absolutely in favor of it. But I'd like to tell you personally why I'm so in favor of this bill. My family was living in Germany when Nazis started to take over the country and my uncle at that time was in an anti-hittler youth movement. His best friend was arrested and my grandfather decided I better get this kid out of town because he's going to get into trouble. So my uncle came to Savannah, Georgia. That's where we had some family and he vowed that he was going to do social justice in Georgia because he was so thankful that he was able to leave Nazi Germany. At which point in time he became chair of the Board of Education when the schools were being integrated. And it's hard enough to be the chair of the Board of Ed at that time in our country's existence. But it was a double whammy because we were Jewish. And there was a man named JB Stoner who was a white supremacist who had a newspaper called the Thunderbolt and he criticized incessant.

My uncle as the president Jew of the Board of Education, and at one point in time, they came in front of his house when his family was all there with the sign, and I don't want to use the word, but it starts with the letter N, loving Jew. So it was a really terrible experience. There was no hate crime bill at that time. They started to light a fire with a religious symbol on his front lawn, and luckily the police came at that point. He continued to serve as the president of the Board of Ed to help out everybody. So I want this hate crime bill to have that explanation of what anti-semitism is, and I really encourage you to pass it for that reason. Thank you. All right, thank you, Miss Wilk, or any questions in the committee. All right, thank you. Next we have Harold Kurtz. We have two minutes and 50 seconds on the clock. Good evening. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, I appreciate the time that you have created for us to discuss HB30. The leaflets put on Atlanta residents yards and driveways in recent weeks are anti-semitic rhetoric at some of its worst. These leaflets also recently made their way to the yards of reddests that it's throughout Georgia, and including we heard this morning in Canton. It places a target on the back of any Jew and creates an atmosphere for violence. A specific example of such violence was the 2018 shooting, a tree of life congregation in Pittsburgh where 11 Jews were killed during worship services. The shooter espoused a false and anti-semitic conspiracy theory to justify his crimes. To create a better understanding of what we face, most of the Jewish community supports HB30 to adopt the Ira definition of anti-semitism. As Representative Carson pointed out in his speech, most of the Jewish community supports this particular bill. There's a large number of organizations and congregations that are listed in the letter that Representative Carson referred to. Anti-semitism frequently charges Jews with conspiring humanity and is often used to blame Jews for why things go wrong. It is expressed in speech writing visual forms and action and employ sinister stereotypes and negative character traits. Anti-semitism is the oldest known hatred in the world against a specific group of people. And ever since the Charlottesville anti-semitic and racist march of 2017, the anti-semitic hate has spewed forth at even greater velocity during these recent times, especially in the internet, where many anti-semitic gather and trade comments and schemes. The Jewish community condemns hatred in all its forms and all hatred that is shown to all groups. Be it racist, Islamophobic, homophobic, trans-anti-Asian, anti-Latino, Lindy immigrant, and anti-trans hatred all must be condemned the strongest possible terms. Anti-semitism is the hatred that we face ourselves simply because we are Jews. And some of us must face multiple forms of hatred because we are also Black, Latino, Asian, immigrant, and gay. We thank you for considering this bill and we hope that you pass it. Thank you very much. All right, any questions or Mr. Kurtz? All right, thank you. At this point, we have 20 seconds. Not asking by the speak for 20 seconds. I do know a lot of people came here to speak for and against the bill. And there's me, people I did not get to, but at this point, I'm going to go to the people that are against the bill and then we'll have the author do any closing statement you want to make briefly as well. So going to, and if anybody still wants to submit any written testimony to the committee, even no matter what happens today, before the bill goes to the floor, if it goes out of committee, we'll still take that. I know some people have already done that. Mr. Chairman, you would like the 20 seconds, we have somebody who would like to take that. Okay, I'll do that enough 20 seconds. You'll state your name. My name is Rabbi Khyam Naitich. I'm the Executive Director of the Jewish Student Union. I work currently with over 3,000 Jewish teens in our state and I've worked with over 30,000 over the past nearly three decades I've worked here. I can tell you that Aaron's story, well extreme, he's not alone. Many of our Jewish teens suffer and I don't know any Jewish two knows, not had an anti-Semitic experience. So I'm asking right now to please go ahead and accept this because Jewish teens and their students throughout Georgia are suffering and it's important to go ahead and provide them these types of protections. Okay, well thank you and I appreciate any questions for the committee. Thank you, if you did it in 20 seconds too. So I didn't want to rush you, but thank you. Thank you. Thank you, everybody for being so patient. All right, moving on to the cons, I'm just gonna go straight down the list for 20 minutes. We'll start with Joe Sterling. Mr. Sterling, good evening. Good about you. Okay, let me... Losing your pen. Yeah, I'll get that. Okay, let me get my, okay. I'll be brief as possible. First I'm honored to be here and thank you for the opportunity to let me state my views. One HB30, I'm speaking to you in two capacities as a member of the Georgia chapter of J Street, the Progressive Pro Israel Political Group as a 25 year Jewish resident of Cobb County. All of us here in the capital oppose anti-semitism. Of many of us believe there are better ways to fight it than adopting HB30. As a non-legally binding working definition, Ira is used in the Jewish community throughout the country. As one of the many useful tools in the toolbox on understanding confronting anti-semitism. That's true and I've heard that said, but at the same time, there's been opposition to codifying what this is, a non-legally binding working definition. Groups and experts in the Jewish community have argued that the definition cites contemporary examples of anti-semitism that could be used a stifle free speech on the Israeli and Palestinian issue if the definition is codified. Now, what's the consensus in the Jewish community on codifying the working definition? It's not monolithic. You read the news accounts in the Jewish press like Jewish telegraphic agency, the forward, et cetera, over the last two years. The issue has been controversial. From my reading and nuanced view on how to use Ira, the working definition has been prevalent in the Jewish community. Groups representing the reform that's URJ, conservative rabbinical assembly, and the reconstructionists, reconstructing Judaism, branches and mainstream secular entities have supported the definition as an educational tool. But, and this is important context, these same voices have raised concerns about codifying an anti-semitism definition that could result in interpreting lawful free speech as hate speech. Go back and read the stories in 2021 when this was big news at the time. Let me quote from a January 29th, 2009 letter signed by the URJ and the rabbinical assembly among others to the administration and Congress. Using the definition itself to trigger federal or state anti-discrimination laws, though, could be abused to punish constitutionally protected if objectionable speech. We at J Street are part of the coalition called the Progressive Israel Network. We're all liberal supporters of Israel. Our local chapter raised the issue of codification opposition to HP 30 and sent a letter to the House and to the judiciary detailing our opinion. Our opinion is in sync with the Network's position. And I wrote an op-ed in the forward that I sent to you guys. I don't understand why Georgia legislators fighting anti-semitism want to support a controversial definition of the scourge. There are better airtight definitions out there that say what anti-semitism is and what it isn't. One of those definitions was written by Trua, the rabbinic group, Trua's part of the Progressive Israel Network. And it has a presence in Atlanta. And other is the Jerusalem Declaration of Anti-Semitism. A definition supported on the House floor recently by Representative Holly. For the record, I favor unbridled and frank talk from all sides on issues involving Israel. I don't see how we can achieve solutions and peace if we demonize the players. The recently passed Georgia hate crimes law covers anti-semitism in my opinion and is thorough. My question, why do we need a separate law on anti-semitism? If the hate crimes law doesn't cover this, I don't understand why that legislation had so much hard-foot support in the Jewish community over the years. I just don't understand that. Everyone is outraged by the rise in the anti-Semitic hatred and violence in the United States. I surely am outraged. I'm pleased Georgia legislators are focused on the issue and I share their outrage. People like me, average citizens out and about in the community are the ones who face anti-semitism in big and little ways. But adopting HB30 is not the way to tackle this. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Mr. Sterling. Any questions from the committee? All right. Thank you. Thank you. Next we have is it Marty White? I'm going to see my targeted more space for Palestinian. OK. Thank you. Next on a list is it Bena Godbian? I'm probably butchered in any way I apologize. Come on up. How are you? How are you? I'm good. Good. I'm going to edge my breath. OK. Hi, everyone. My name is Dr. Banahal D'Ban. I'm a professor at Spellman a few minutes away. And I have a PhD in ethnic studies, which is the study of race and ethnicity. And how it manifests globally. I am curious to know whether or not scholars in the field of ethnic studies were consulted in the creation of the Ira definition that we're using from May 26, 2016. Because if we were, we may point out some significant anomalies. And the first one has been mentioned before, which is that Jewish people are not a monolithic category. Out of 11 of the examples of anti-Semitism that Ira presented, seven of them had to do with critiquing Israel or Zionism. It is anti-Semitic to assume that all Jewish people unequivocally support Israel. And the scholar Ella Shohat, who is a Mizrahi Jewish scholar, born in Palestine, points this out. And she says that it is actually a puts Mizrahi Jewish people in a paradoxical position by framing Jewishness against Palestinianness. It erases indigenous Jewish Palestinians. So I urge you to consider, is this bill protecting the whitest and the lightest of Jewish people? Is there a way that as scholars and ethnic studies point out, we could understand how white supremacy is an overlapping triangle made of anti-blackness, anti-nativeness, and xenophobia, and that these systems are interwoven together and that if we can center the most marginalized voices in this discussion, we can actually create the kind of futures that we want. So I urge you, for those of you who are thinking that voting against this or voting for this will protect a sub-sector of the population. I urge you to consider who it might also exclude. Thank you. All right, thank you. Any questions from the committee? All right, thank you. Next we have Peyton Hayes. It's Peyton Hayes still here. Okay, come on up. Good evening. Hello. I'm Peyton. I'm an officer with Students for Justice in Palestine at UGA. And today we stand against all forms of discrimination. That's why we demand that the Georgia Senate committee on judiciary votes no on the IRA definition of anti-semitism because this definition is problematic for several reasons other than its vagueness. I must ask, does this country protect freedom of speech or not, while we must fiercely engage in the fight against racism, hatred, and discrimination, this is not how we do it. Is the goal to fight bigotry or to make an argument for censorship? Where does this legislation has passed? It has impacted Palestinian advocacy at all levels, including campus, community, and nationally. And there's no doubt that this will have an impact on student advocacy for the Palestinian cause. It's extremely dangerous to conflate anti-signism with anti-semitism. And as a member of Students for Justice in Palestine at UGA, this legislation put a target on our national organizations back as if there wasn't already one. We should be able to stand firmly against Israel's crimes and our country's complicity in allowing these crimes to be carried out against the Palestinian people and other groups targeted by both Israel and the US. Exchanges like Gile, deserve criticism too. Exchanging discriminatory counterterrorism and surveillance measures only harms vulnerable and marginalized communities. And we can stand up against police terror here, but it's wrong to stand up for Palestinian Americans and Palestinians abroad. Our black Americans and allies in the movement against racism and police terror anti-American can we not advocate for ourselves without being attacked on the basis of being prejudicial? It's our right to share our criticisms of any country, including countries that are intimately tied to US politics and supported by US funding. So I ask again, we can't advocate for this legislation while claiming to protect freedom of speech. It basic right that this country prides itself in. You can't genuinely fight discrimination by passing legislation that creates the ability to discriminate against another group. Palestinians experience the effects of both racism, Islamophobia in the United States, which has much to do with how the US portrays people in West Asia and the role of US and Western militarism in the region. Are we ready to contribute to this further marginalization? There's no denying that the elected representatives overwhelmingly support Israel, but you cannot stray away from how this bill will impact people who advocate for human rights and freedoms abroad. Again, this bill does not effectively define anti-Semitism for what it really is. And like others have said, this definition is largely debated within the Jewish community. Instead, it works as a tool of censorship that falsely conflates attempts to hold the Israeli government accountable with anti-Semitism. And this definition has already been used to silence activists against the country and right here in Georgia. And many of its most vocal proponents openly praise how it targets Palestinian rights activism. So let's seriously consider if we want to fight hatred and bigotry by enabling the system to further discriminate against groups that are disproportionately targeted by the state. Do not respond to this terrible, terrible outrageous rise in anti-Semitism by victimizing Palestinian advocacy. In January 2020, that the State Department of Education, the State Department of Education, open an investigation regarding a federal complaint against UCLA. The complaint was for simply hosting the 2018 Students for Justice in Palestine National Conference. Following the Pittsburgh Tree of Life shooting, bombings in Gaza, Berkeley, SJP, and Jewish Voice for Peace chapters, plans to hold a joint vigil to mourn the dead. This event faced backlash and was forced to be canceled. Georgians say no to HB 30. Georgians say no to this definition. And Georgians say no to anti-Semitism. Thank you. All right, thank you, Miss Hayes. Any questions from the committee? All right. And we have nine minutes and 51 seconds left. Next, is it Desiree Jocelyn? I see my clients. OK, thank you. Josh, is it Kason? Carson? Come on up. I was about to say, now, it looked like C-A-S-S-S-O. And I thought you maybe had a cousin, but I wasn't going to give Ben a for the doubt. It's possible. It is possible. We never know. Good evening. Good evening, everyone. My name is Joshua Carson, with the Party for Socialism and Liberation. I'm calling on Georgia to reject the IHRA work and definition of anti-Semitism in the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism. Multiple points conflate. I don't need that. Sorry. OK. Multiple points conflate anti-Semitism with criticism of the state of Israel. These points will be used to suppress pro-Palestinian activism and has already been done before. We have seen in other areas of the country and organizations and on college campuses, this definition has been used to silence Palestinian activism not to combat hate crimes. This does not protect Jewish Georgians, but serves as a check in the box of the government of Georgia to say that they are trying to take action against anti-Semitism rather than actually doing so. Including the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism is not an oversight or a fluke. It is part of a broader wave of cracking down on protest movements, including the construction of what's known as COPS City and other piece of legislation previously discussed in this session. Two years ago, the city saw the largest pro-Palestinian protest with several hundreds in the streets. In pursuit of a definition of anti-Semitism, this is not the answer. All right, thank you, Mr. Carson. Any questions? All right. Thank you. Next, we have Connie's Saasnaf. Good evening. Wait, do you have a question for the last speaker? Okay, come on out. Sorry. Let's stop. Stop, Saasnaf. Are you okay? Come on out. I hope I'm okay. Hi, my name is Connie Saasnaf. I'm half Korean and half Jewish, and I've lived in Georgia for over 32 years. So I'm just gonna tell you what happened in something that I was involved in. I was invited to speak at Georgia Tech at a apartheid week event planned by the young Democratic Socialists of America. We were gonna talk about Palestine history along with two Palestinian Americans. The event was disrupted by some HLL members, and one of the HLL staff members was not allowed to enter the room because we had heard earlier that they were gonna disrupt the event. And so the leaders excluded people who were gonna be purposefully disrupted. So afterwards, HLL charged YDSA with discrimination because they claimed that the only reason the person was not allowed in the room was because they were Jewish, but that is exactly a lie. There were many Jewish people in the room. The Georgia Tech Office of Student Integrity looked into the claim and first sanctioned YDSA. After an appeal, though, by YDSA and a petition signed by over 1,000 people, the Office of Student Integrity dropped the complaint charge. And then HLL went to the Department of Education Office of Civil Rights and claimed discrimination because Georgia Tech did not sanction YDSA. So what happened in the end of that is they had a settlement and now Georgia Tech was forced to adopt the Ira definition of anti-Semitism. So much of this is about just silencing voices on Palestine and silencing anybody who is critical of Israel. And I just wanted to say, you have written testimony by the Georgia Tech student in your folder, please read it. If the State of Georgia adopts this definition of anti-Semitism, I believe that no campus group and no professor will be able to teach anything truthful about Palestine. And this is exactly what the sponsors and the proponents of this bill want. Please vote no on this bill. Thank you very much. All right, thank you. Do you have a question from the committee? The first one of the question. Wow. Senator Hatchett. Thank you. When you say history professors or professors will be prevented from teaching some truth about Palestine, could you go into that a little bit more? So there's a case right now at George Washington University. There's a Palestinian professor, Palestinian American professor, who was sanctioned, I think by I don't know all the details, I'm sorry, but she was sanctioned by George Washington University because a student claimed that she was saying very anti-Semitic things in a course that wasn't really a course, it was a free whatever. So George Washington, again, I don't know the details, did something or something or other. And she basically was right now, Palestine legal, is actually suing George Washington University for being anti-Palestinian and anti not allowing people to speak the truth. Another case is Steven Saleda. He was offered a position at the University of Illinois in Champaign, Urbana. And he accepted this deal. And then somebody pulled up a tweet that he had done, I think it was a tweet, in 2014, during a netrocious attack on Gaza, he's, I believe he's Palestinian American as well. And so the University of Illinois withdrew their support from that particular offer of a tenured track position. And so he sued and he got some settlement, but he has never, but they never, institute gave him back his job. And he has had one other job in teaching. And at the last time he was interviewed, he was driving a bus because no one will let him teach, because they are so afraid of being accused of anti-Semitism. Kenneth Roth, who is the human rights, he was the executive director of human rights watch, when human rights produced their apartheid report. And he was then offered a position at Harvard at the Kennedy School of Something Something. And then the dean of that school withdrew that offer to him after, and it turned out that it was because he had said so many critical things about Israel, calling it an apartheid state, which is what many human rights organizations have called Israel. So after a lot of public outcry, because this is Harvard being controlled by people who don't want somebody to speak out on Israel, at an in a department that is supposed to honor human rights, that they reinstated his position. I mean, I personally don't have in my memory, on and on and on, but if you go to Palestine legal, there are lists of this. And it really is, this definition is attacking academics. They do not want people talking about Israel in a negative way. They don't want people teaching about Israel Palestine in a truthful way. I'm telling you the truth, because a lot of people will tell you that only the Israeli narrative is the truthful narrative on Israel Palestine. And they will tell you Palestinian narratives are lies. They will tell you flat out they're all lies. So they are already chilling the speech. Does that answer your question? Yeah, that's right. Yeah, thank you. The clock's not running just for our community, first of all, it's not, I'm just telling my committee, when they blame me for being here at 9 o'clock, it's not running, Senator Satsar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to say as kindly, but as directly as I can appreciate your presentation, as a free speech constitutionalist, I've got some concerns about this bill. I would say to the speakers before you, the two speakers before you, with humility, they did more to pass this bill in its existing form than anybody that's presented today, the two speakers before you that were opposing this bill. Can you? Your talk against the bill, the screed that we heard here, did more to undermine the critics of this than anything I've heard today. All right. Mr. Chairman, what I should ask you, a question is, I've shared with members of our committee right off the IITRA framework, the working definite contemporary examples of anti-semitism public life. And one of these, it goes on, and some of these are clearly anti-Semitic. But one of them talks about making stereotypical allegations of Jews controlling the media, economy, governments, societal institutions. You unpack this. Now, what we're wrestling with is something that, or this is the predicate act on which a hate crime is going to be based, or in which a act of discrimination, which is a very serious circumstance to be based. As I read this, somebody saying something that's in bad form, somebody saying something that's ugly, but making a stereotypical allocation about Jews controlling portions of Wall Street or Hollywood falls squarely within the definition of anti-Semitism here. My concern is, as a free speech person, what is the remedy? You're coming to say, don't vote for this bill. What many people in the panel are looking for is, what is the proper framework to define anti-Semitism? If you're concerned that this website, which highlights the IHRA framework outside of a statutory definition, what is the proper definition? I can't answer that. Hundreds and thousands of scholars can't answer that. But I think the real framework is to look at this as my comment. I'm not. The pre-alcohol is available if you need a lawyer to vote. Oh, pre-alcohol is available. My lawyer friend is available. But I got to be fair until the last time. I'm going to order who signed up. So that way, I'm not picking whose test is going to. I think the way to dismantle anti-Semitism is the same way you dismantle any hatred, any racism, any anti-Asian-Asian hatred. You educate people that what they're hearing is wrong. You don't allow people to make these comments. You say, where do you get that? Why would you ever say something like that, except that you heard that somewhere? I think it's universal. It is not isolated to Jews. Jews are not special. We are just another category where people can hate on us. I'm also half Korean. I mean, people can hate on me for that. I'm sure people who are black have way more understanding of what anti-black racism is. And they could probably tell you more how to dismantle it than me, because they're all part of the same. It's the same idea. It's the same idea of whatever. See y'all get that. OK. Thank you. Thank you. All right, we have six minutes and 22 seconds. Next, Reverend, is it far ahead? And I can't read your last name. A, B, U, A. OK. OK, you'll tell me. Good evening. My name is Farhad Ablaqel. Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, and it's good to see my senator, Ilena Parent, state senator. And I hope that we will look at this bill seriously and say, move it from a bill and to become a law, to be a resolution for the following reasons. It is unconstitutional. It negates our constitutional right to free speech. The IHRA conflict anti-Semitism with legitimate criticism of the policies of the government of the Sarban state, Israel, as a survivor of the Israeli ethnic cleansing of Palestine in 1948. And many other Israeli human right violation I should have the right to justly criticize these human rights abuses without being labeled anti-Semitic by the state of Georgia, which is what the passage of IHRA would lead to. We as Americans need to be free to criticize the policies of any government, including Israel and other Middle Eastern countries, and our own government too. This is how.

Freedom of the democracy works, adopting IRHA would silence our protected free speech and would not help in anti-Semitism. Lastly, if this adopted, could this trend be extended? Would criticism of Saudi Arabia, human right violation be considered against Islam? Would criticism of China human right abuses? Then consider anti-Asian racism. It is dangerous, bad to walk down, to quill legitimate criticism of any state, for human rights abuses or other practices or policies. I was born at 25 miles north of west of Nazareth in the Galilee area. My parents are Palestinian, they are Arab, and they are Christians. So I am an Israeli citizen and at the same time I came from my education to the United States. I am an American citizen. If we are serious about anti-Semitism, we deal with anti-Semitism. If I criticize the occupation of Israel in the West Bank, that if you are a Christian in Bethlehem, can I go six miles from Bethlehem to Jerusalem without a permit? If I say that, I become anti-Semitic. So as a highly educated person, I still question the definition of anti-Semitism for Jews alone, because as a Palestinian, I am Semitic. So linguistically speaking, I am questioning the definition. I hope you defeat it. Thank you very much. All right, thank you. You have no questions. Next, George and I am, is M.A. is it K? Okay, H. Come on up. You saw my handwriting, you know I can't judge you at all. And we have two minutes and 55 seconds remaining for the cons. My name is father George Mahloof. I am an Orthodox priest. I was born in West Jerusalem. In 1948, I was five years old when the Irgun and Haganah, Jewish terrorist organizations, threatened people, if you don't leave, your fate will be the same fate of the village of Derya Sin. Derya Sin is a village near Jerusalem that Zionist committed a massacre. So when we talk about H.B.30, this is an encouragement. If you adopt it, it's encouragement for the continuation of the 70 years of ethnic cleansing, of the indigenous native people, descendants of the Canaanites, before Abraham came from Westibatemia, and before Moses came from Egypt, the Canaanites were always there. When you say, if you criticize the state of Israel, which was based on the skulls of the native indigenous people in Palestine, it's an apartheid entity, and it's a racist. We have to differentiate between saying the Jews, which is a faith like Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, and the Zionism that is a racist political entity. So how can you, I come to your house with a gun, pointed at your face at your head, and say, if you don't leave, this is my house, God gave it to me. If you don't leave, you will find your fate, you will die. Is this right or wrong? I think it's understandable that it's really wrong. When you come to a house and threaten people of death, just because you think that God gave you this house, and people have to leave. Tom has expired. Do you have a question? You said you're Orthodox. Are you Orthodox Christian? I was unclear if you were... I was a Christian from Jerusalem, living near the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and few miles from the Nativity Inn, from Nazareth where the Holy Land. Thank you. All right, thank you. I think we got through about the same number of speakers, almost identical number of speakers, and a lot of folks were still... I understand. I understand. I'm sorry, but at this point we have to move on with the bill, and I appreciate everybody's patience. If it y'all listen to that, we've had to order this whole time if we can please keep ordering the room. If not, we're going to have to have you escort it out. At this point... At this point... I'm going to ask you to please take your seat, understand. Everybody's frustrated. None of us wanted to start late, but unfortunately given the time we have, we have to limit the time that we can hear things. So to keep us on track, I'm going to ask for two minutes. I'll let the author close us out, and then we'll ask for the actual bill from the committee. Before I get into the bill, I just want to say thank you. I'm a legislator like you. It's a passionate subject. There's emotion on both sides, but I would say there's a fair amount of misinformation. I just want to clear up a couple of things. One, this does not, and I want to speak to all the committee. This does not impact free speech whatsoever. I need to be very clear on that. If you look at lines 30 through 35, I can fault Israel. I can fault the Jews. I can say they own the banks. Nothing in here impacts free speech. It has to be a predicate in regard to an active discrimination or an act of crime. I can say whatever I want about the Jews, the nation of Israel, what have you. There's not impact free speech. What we're doing here is creating or codifying a definition of anti-Semitism, such that Georgia will be in line with the Department of State, Department of Education, the prior president's executive order, eight states by statute, 22 by executive order. I would not want Georgia to be an outlier. I can't emphasize that enough. I do not want Georgia to be an outlier here. Thank you again for your consideration. I do have the two amendments to strengthen the bill, I think. If we adopt both of those amendments, particularly the second one, 0104, Georgia will be in line with the federal government. There's no daylight between state law that we codify in regard to anti-Semitism versus federal law. We're not creating a new class, a new penalty, a new, anything like that. We're strictly stating a criteria, a definition for protecting the Jews and the Jewish people that are so targeted with hate crimes. With that, I've got eight seconds left. I just want to say thank you, and I just asked for the committee's favorable consideration on behalf of the vast majority of Jewish groups. Thank you. Thank you, Representative Carson. At this point, the time has expired for the presentation, the pros and the cons, and for the closing, we will first see if we have a motion, then we'll move into the next phase. Is there a motion from the committee? What's your mic number? 14. Senator Watson. I'd like to make a motion, do pass. We have motion, do pass. We are working off the bill is passed by the House. Motion to pass by Senator Watts. Do we have a second? Second from Senator Kennedy. At this point, do we have any discussion? All right. Let me turn your mic on. What's your 14 again? 14. Okay. Senator Watts. I didn't, there was a amendment offered by the author. I guess I'm going to order. There's two potential amendments he asked for. Would you like to take amendments up first and we can get a discussion? I might be better. Okay. Let's start with any amendments in the committee. Are you all from the amendment, Senator Watson? Yes. Okay. Don't we have the amendment, AAM490102 and AAM490104? That was the amendments, right? There were two that the author proposed that you have in your folder. Let's offer them one at a time. If you're going to offer them. Okay. Are you all for an AAM490102? Yes. And so that's the amendment that would add, Antisemitism has the meaning as provided for the definition of and this would be online 14. This would be replacing line 14 with that. Is everybody have that in front of them? Yes. I just want to stay just for clarity. All this does is strike the word advisory. That's all it does. Right. We have a second for this amendment. We have a second from Senator Hatz. Can you discuss on the amendment itself, Senator Setsler? It's a parliamentary or any commissioner, I really want to understand the posture here. I want to make sure that if we're taking up amendments that would render subsequent amendments and that would be a non-german because something in conflict has stymied it as it were from being considered. I want to make sure that the committee is aware of the procedural posture render. I've got a, it is my, and I can offer it in the form of substitute notion of a need to, but I want to make sure I understand sometimes with amendments and adopted that amends a line of a bill that would then be amended by another amendment. It's considered by the chair non-german because it's already been amended. I want to make sure I understand that. So that's the permanent grant. Am I correct in my understanding of the posture, Mr. Chair? Well, I think so. I guess I haven't really had that come up before. I think the way it will work is if we hear this amendment, and I think the proper time will be in discussion. If you want to ask that the amendment be held in discussion, then we could do it at this time, but that would potentially impact future amendments if you're trying to amend something that's already taken out of the bill. Mr. Chairman, because I asked that question, the substantive, the substantive of my question is, is potential substitute amendment, if it's appropriate. What I'd like to do is, I don't want to, something that members of the body would like to consider, but would be not procedurally germane. So I'd like to contemplate a substitute amendment that would delete words on lines 14 through 16 from the word anti-Semitism. It says, it says, the same meaning is provided for the advisory definition of anti-Semitism, dotted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, May 26, 2019, 2016. What was passed out, this list, it's a list of working definitions of anti-Semitism on a website that was, it was referenced in an executive order, that's the gentleman's underlying motion, but it's not a statutory definition that provides language that we think about which are elements for a predicate to a hate crime. I mean, a definition, and I gave the, provide the copies to everybody here, if you read this contemporary examples of anti-Semitism, could it take in overall include, but not limited to, there's a list of things. What we're saying is, if something, the effect of gentleman's underlying amendment is, this page is what, this entire debate hinges on. And I don't know that we've really wrestled with this as a committee, is that the underlying language in this, these are the elements. If one of these elements is satisfied, if the gentleman's amendment passes, then anti-Semitism has been proven for evidentiary purposes as a predicate for a hate crime. So if some crimes performed, and one of these things is satisfied off this website, then the predicate box is checked for intent for a hate crime. Since when do we have a website that's got a working definition, if the examples, the four examples which are enumerated in this, are satisfied, become the evidentiary check box as a predicate check. The intent predicate's been checked. Now, if there's an act, it's a hate crime. That's what we're doing in this, and I don't know that the members that we really wrestle with that as a committee. The strongest place to be is take the definition, the actual definition of hate crime, or the actual definition of anti-Semitism, which is actually begins on line 16, a certain perception of Jews which by expression goes on. That definition also comes from IHRA, but is the definition of anti-Semitism. It's not the examples. When we accept the words from line 14 has the same meaning through May 26, 2016, we accept that language or the amendment that's referenced in the executive order. What we're doing, we're grafting into Georgia law, a website definition, which is adopted in a convention, as a working non-binding definition, we're grafting that into law. And that is not how we operate as a general assembly. I think we do well to operate with concrete words, because these words have concrete meanings. They are the, when these definitions are satisfied, it is the predicate. It's matched with another act that is either in video's discrimination, which is a civil circumstance, or it's a hate crime. Let me ask you this, and let's counsel Mr. Higby, if you want to weigh in, my understanding is if we, before we get to that point, the current amendment would just strike the word advisory on line 14. If that's the doubt that I don't know what would prevent you from offering a subsequent amendment that reworks that paragraph, is that your question, because I guess we could take out one amendment at a time if you ever opposed to amendment as well. I just wanted to first kind of prove the chair's posture on that procedural question. That's my, my wrong on that, Mr. Higby, is there anything that would prevent him? Chair, I have to prove to Mr. Mike. Which one are you? Three. I defer to Senate Research on a parliamentary question. I mean, I think legally the answer is that the certainly you could adopt one amendment and then adopt a second amendment that just wipes that out. Okay, essentially. That's, so you want to turn, you want to weigh in? No. You agree? Okay, so what we're going to approach this, if everybody's an agreement, is we will take amendments, we have one being offered now, and even with the passes or not, it wouldn't preclude you from amending the same section again with another amendment that could be proposed. Does that make sense? It does, Mr. Chairman. I just want to make sure that all of them, this is a very important issue. I think, and I appreciate everybody on both sides of this question. I think we are clearly persuaded there's an issue here that needs to be addressed. The question is, how does a legislature address that in words, which have the effect of law? And I think the way this works, in fact, the way this works is, we're drafting it, we're drafting in a working definition, which have some, for example, which, if satisfied, demonstrate definitively that the predicate act of discrimination and as some of them exist, which match with the crime becomes hate crime. All right, let's do this. Let's take up any questions, any discussion on the proposed amendment that's been motioned in second, which is 490102, everybody has it for them. Any further discussion on that amendment? Striking the law in advisory, you know, the law in 14. All right, all those in favor of the amendment, please raise your hand. All right, count seven. Can I still count this guy? Seven. Any opposed? Senator Sessler, do you vote four against it? I think that's not clear how it floats in the viewers. But no. Oh, yes. Okay, well, yes, this is unanimous. All right, so do we have other amendments that amendments adopted, any other amendments from the committee? All right, Senator 13 or 14? 14. Senator Watson. As the author had suggested, also, AM40104, as it's read in front of us, replacing lines 16 through 19 with, with, I think everybody has it in front of May 16, 2016, it adopts the federal executive order 13899 of December 11, 2019 84, FR 68779, with the purpose and enforcement title 6th, the Federal Civil Rights Act 1964, 42 U.S.C. Section 2000D. So it's the executive order that that's that replacing is basically what it's doing. Okay, is there a second for the amendment? Second from Senator Hatchett. Any discussion on this proposed amendment? All right, all those in favor of the amendment, please raise your hand. So it's five, all those opposed, like, son, five, three, the amendment is adopted. Do we have any other amendments from the committee? Senator Setsler. Mr. Chairman, offering the amendment that should be, everybody's distributed members, it says the House Bill 30, it says, delete lines, 14 through 19, in their entirety, insert, and they're following. It's in the way down here, Senator Setsler. So he wants to call the commissioner, I don't think. Yes. So you author have this proposed amendment as well? I do. Could I speak to it? Let him offer first, second. Sure, sure. And I'll let you respond. Mr. Chairman, offering it, what it does is it creates a, what I believe to be an appropriate statutory language that says, and I says, sympathism, folks that are listening, NSM, it means a negative perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred directed towards Jewish individuals, or their property, or towards Jewish community institutions or religious facilities. So again, it says there's a negative perception towards Jews, doesn't require that there be hate, but which may be expressed as hatred directed towards individuals, individuals property, community institutions or facilities. I believe, if you ask folks who wrestle in law, what NIsentism is, this is the kind of definition we expect to be a predicate for demonstrating MIsentism, which is the, again, the predicate for a hate grime. Or in Vitties discrimination. This is why I would, what it would do, it would, it would white clean this working definition as it's referenced in the executive order and provide, I think, a crisp statutory definition, which is taken from this, modified some, but I think very generous, very appropriate, but not exactly what's proposed in the House first. All right, is everybody understand the proposed amendment? Is everybody having it in front of them? Getting ahead, not so. Do we have a second for the proposed amendment? You have a second for Senator Jones, and now we'll go into discussion. Senator Parent. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Setslow just wanted to try to really drill down on your proposal. So I think I'm reading it correctly that essentially what you have done is taken the definition in the bill that passed the House and put it as the definition of anti-Semitism, but removed the reference to the advisory definition adopted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. Am I correct that that's what your this amendment does? Yes, ma'am, I have. I just, I just removed that reference to the working definition. I took the definition and I changed the word certain perception of Jews to negative perception of Jews, which I think is the appropriate. Oh, I didn't. Okay, thank you for clarifying that because I had not caught that that you changed it to negative. I mean, I think what we're all grappling with is the some very complex issues, which are nuance to a certain extent. Part of it is the fact that for whatever reason there's definitely some amount of controversy about not necessarily this definition, but the examples that Senator Setslow handed out seem to be, I think, the source of most of the customization as it relates to this definition, probably not. And then, of course, the fact that we've spent a couple hours hearing about certain intractable disputes in the Middle East that I thought were above my pay, pay grade, as a Georgia State Senator. So I just wanted to throw that out as, as, as discussion. All right. We, any other discussion? I'm going to let you respond. Any other discussion in the committee first on the proposed amendment? I'll let the author respond to my friend from Cobb County. We both are looking for the same objective. We want to end the hatred. We want to end these flyers that are coming out, which this bill would not prevent. And this bill would not target. It has to be, we're looking at analyzing the intent behind illegal discriminatory actions. So I didn't mean to say predicate, I'm sorry, I'm not an attorney. We're looking at the analy, we're like analyzing the intent, the type behind illegal discriminatory actions, whether it be crime, discrimination, discrimination, housing, finance, employment, what have you? When we, Ira is a definition that is adopted by 1100 entities all over the world. And I would very much hesitate on Georgia adopting our own definition because the Department of State has, has Ira, part of education, the executive order from former President Trump back in 2019, 22 resolutions from both red and blue states, six states, seven states, possibly eight states adopted by statute. What we're doing here is exactly why we, we would want that I appreciate Senator Watson, Chairman Watson, I'm sorry, adopting the definition by reference because we are going in and deciding what we think is would be a better definition, rather than some keeping in something standard with among the people who are in the state. With amongst 1100 other non-governmental entities, as well as various states departments of the United States government and obviously in, in sync with the federal order. Keep in mind, if did if we were adopt my friend from Cobb County, my good friend from Cobb County, Cobb County, if we adopt this amendment, there will be a difference between the federal definition for anti-semitism and the state definition for anti-semitism. And so I would just ask that we stay with the Ira definition just as the Senate Judiciary Committee passed year unanimously last year. All right, go ahead. If I just may add a couple things, Senator Setsler, thank you for your proposal. My concern is just off the top because I just saw it now is for example, you said anti-semitism means a negative perception of Jews which may be expressed. Well, there's certain positive perception of Jews that still get Jews killed. So saying that Jews are rich is a positive perception. People still kill Jews because they believe that they're rich or that they control things. It's not necessarily a quote-unquote negative perception. So just off the top, I'm concerned about the language us substituting the judgment for commissions that had met for years and vetted this definition before coming up with it. And that's the definition that's been accepted worldwide. So my concern, even though the intent is wonderful, is that we're going to miss something that Ira has already captured. Additionally, you've mentioned predicate a couple times like a check the box. That's not exactly what this is. And I do criminal defense. So I understand predicate, I understand Rico. I understand, check the box. This allows, this definition allows a prosecutor or an investigator to try to discern the motive behind a crime. But it's not a check the box. It's a look at this and see if there's an ability, if this person was acting with the anti-semitic intent. And then it's a revital presumption. It's not a check the box. You hit example one or you hit example two. That's why they're advisory in essence. So I would ask that this Senate adopt the amendments that Senator Watson proposed if the Senate's to say intact. Senator Jones. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just have a few questions. Actually, four. Number one, did title six, the fact that title six does not apply to religion. Did that play any role do you believe in the fact of the executive order being signed? Because that would be a whole that doesn't exist like in our hate crime statute because our hate crime statute does apply to religion. So that's just one issue. That's just one question I'm asking. So religion doesn't necessarily, I think an example is provided. I can't speak to title six, but what I can speak to is that there's a hole in the Georgia hate crime statute title. It talks about religion Jews are not just a religion. And so if you say it swastika, that's not a religious because there's nothing in the Torah or the Talmud about a swastika. So it's not the same thing as a cross is to a Christian. There's nothing in the in our religious texts about a swastika. So we all know it's anti-Semitic just by knowing that the Nazis targeted Jews and killed so many of us. But it would but somebody who does a swastika can say, well, I wasn't targeting them. I was targeting something political. I mean, they have that immediate defenses because Jews are not just a religion. So they're we're trying to plug this hole by defining anti-Semitism. That 100%. I would just wondering maybe because title six didn't apply to religion.

perhaps just from a political standpoint that you say, okay, we'll put this definition in because even though yes, it is more encompassing than that. There is potentially this hole there because religion is not covered. So I was just wondering, my second question is, has there been any rulemaking from this executive order by the Department of Education or the Office of Civil Rights? Are they operating under any rules? Are they still kind of wrestling with that? I will defer, I don't know if our expert knows, but I don't know off the top of my head. So I would ask to defer. So it's still working on accomplishing rules. They have to get one case and that executive order is six point nine, two, three, and there are internal rules and training for how to do it. And that brings an interesting point. So because they actually have settled cases without actually developing the rules as far as this definition is concerned. In other words, Office of Civil Rights has been settling cases dealing with anti-semitism without actually addressing this particular definition, isn't that correct? Yes, come up to the mic if you're answering the question. Question senator, there are 20 years of examples. There are working guides that have been used throughout the world by judges and by prosecutors at the Department of Education also makes use of. And there's 20 years actually of history of exactly how to apply this in law enforcement and in other discriminatory actions. So they're actually they're working from since 2004, essentially 2000 to 2004 examples. Correct. So I guess the question is, without any rulemaking being done based on, because you inserted the executive order and showed the statutory definition or the definition, there has been no rulemaking specifically based on that executive order. But there has been settlement of cases where they say that something is anti-semitism. In other words, we have not had to rely on this definition or wrestling with today to determine that something has been anti-semitic, correct? We absolutely have, sir. In many of the cases that they've settled, they've said it's definitely anti-semitate because it violates the IRA definition and goes into explanations. And that's been in most of the cases that have been settled. I can't say you've cited the IRA definition. I will say that in the three that I have been involved in, yes. But there are others out there that did not. So can't speak to them at everyone that I know of has cited to it, but I can't speak to all of them, sir. And on the other states, and this is my final question, on the other states that have adopted it, have they developed any rules or case law specifically dealing with the IRA definition, even though they may be finding anti-semitic issues? Not that I'm aware of, although I can't speak with certainty, but I can tell you, yes, I can redo, and the bill has been passed again, Arizona, Iowa, Tennessee, Arkansas, several others. There has not been, and I monitor this, even a single allegation that any of these bills, which do the exact definition that the accepted amendment would do, has in any way ever silent speech, there has not been a single case even brought that touches upon it. And so most of these bills have been doing exactly what they're supposed to be to, and providing a backstop, going into school handbooks, providing a definition, so anti-semitism doesn't happen that schools know what to look for. All right, Senator Sessler, do you have a question or discussion on the amendment? I did the lady, just to your point, I appreciate you nailed it. It creates a rebuttable presumption. Creating a rebuttable presumption is a shifting of the burden. It is a circumstance where this becomes promifasci evidence that this element that's got to be satisfied. Anti-semitic hate intent, which is an element required for a hate crime, exists. We're in agreement of what this does. I think the concern I've got is this website language, I mean, again, we had a gentleman here from the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Church of the East, who said that denying the Jewish people the right to self-determination. I mean, if he believes, because the Haganah put a gun to his family's face in Bethlehem in 1948, that he has questions about the... I don't necessarily share those concerns, but if he shares those concerns, I mean, this working definition says denying the Jewish people the right to self-determination, or claiming that the existence of the state of Israel is a racist endeavor. If one believes the existence of the racist, the state of Israel is a racist endeavor, if they believe that earnestly, and they express that, then they have satisfied the element of anti-semitism. No, because there has to be an unlawful act, or unlawful discrimination first, before we would even look at what they're... The element of the presence of anti-semitism exists. Now, the hate crime doesn't happen unless there's a crime that comes in. Correct. So if that gentleman attacked me because I'm Jewish, because he's mad about what happened to his family back then, and takes it out on me because on Jewish, that's a hate crime. Right, but we're not debating hate crimes. What we're debating today is anti-semitism. Is the racist, the element of discrimination, which is anti-semitism, exists if this gentleman expresses, as this says in black and white, the existence of the state of Israel is a racist endeavor, if he believes it earnestly, that the existence of the state of Israel is a racist endeavor, then he expresses that. He has satisfied the definition of anti-semitism. Right? He's not committed to hate crime because he hasn't committed a crime. But the definition of anti-semitism has been satisfied by him expressing that belief. It wouldn't come off. But I think we need to show more shame here. Expressing that, there's going to be a criminal act to make it a hate crime, but expressing that satisfies anti-semitism. And I don't know if the members of the committee want to make, I don't know if we, I certainly don't want to create the circumstance of someone holds that opinion, that it checks the block of anti-semitism in Georgia under law, because it certainly, it undeniably does. If they state the existence of the state of Israel is a racist endeavor, then they have satisfied the definition of anti-semitism as being anti-semitic under Georgia law if we best this bill. All right, where we are in the process is we're discussing the amendment, and we're also at the same time taking questions from the author since we did bring the author back up to respond to the amendment, Senator Parent. Thank you. I do have a question for the author, which is, so, you know, and I said this earlier, and I think Senator Sutherland was more attention to it, that the situation we're in is that the IRA definition is somewhat controversial, and that appears to be mostly because of the examples. What he is proposing, first I want to say that to represent a panel, I actually agree with you on the words certain versus the word negative. I think that I actually agree with what you said earlier. I'm looking at Senator Sutherland's proposed amendment. What he's got here other than that, though, isn't that the definition that's in IRA, just minus the examples, and why is that a problem given? I mean, I personally am nervous about the one that he just drew attention to, claiming that the state of Israel's Erasist endeavor. I understand everything about the hate crime, but it does make me a little nervous that that would then be incorporated by reference to be anti-Semitism. I'm just not sure that always would be, and that makes me nervous. So what's wrong with this definition? If we say, look, these examples have some really good things in them, but they also have some problematic things that we don't necessarily want to foist on every situation to be referenced, whether or not a crime is committed or not. A crime is committed, that's a different kind of worms, but if we're talking about just the fact that that definition is in law in Georgia, why is it necessary to your mind to incorporate these examples? And you know particularly this one. With respect to Senator Setsler's amendment is the exact reason why you want to end up did by reference is because otherwise it invites everybody who has an opinion about anti-Semitism to make their own comments and to carve out the things that they don't think should be anti-Semitism. And what anti-Semites do is then they attack Jews for those reasons, like the case I described in New York, where they attack Jews because they hate Israel. That is precisely why the IRA definition includes those examples. Because no matter what, if you attack the Chinese American because you don't like China, everyone would agree that that is racist. But when you attack a Jewish American because you hate Israel or you think it's a racist endeavor, it doesn't matter what you think, but you can't attack them. And Senator Parent, this is exactly what this bill does. It only uses this. Whenever there's a hate crime judge, look at a list of things, they look at prior statements, they look at prior posts, all this does is tell a judge, hey, look at this definition too, because otherwise you might miss anti-Semitism because people often do. All right, Senator Parent, go ahead. Well, then would it not be wise to utilize some of these and actually put them in the, or at least have a vote on whether we think they belong in the bill and exclude the ones that are viewed as problematic by potentially viewed as problematic by some members of the committee? Why is it like all or nothing? I mean, why? With respect, if you start taking out, if you take out the example about Israel's a racist endeavor, let's assume that you believe Israel's a racist endeavor, I'm not saying that you do. Let's assume that a person does. I think we can all agree that they can't then attack or unlawfully discriminate against a Jewish person. Right, to my colleagues point, to me that is a bit of a separate issue because I don't want it utilized. But that's exactly what this bill does. It's only targeted by those two things. I know that's what you want to believe. That's what it says. Things are used all the time, and if the definition of anti-Semitism in Georgia law includes those things, believe me, it will be used in other discussions. It just will. That's just reality, that's life, people are human. To the extent that you're worried about chilling speech Senator, that's why the United States Supreme Court said this does not chill speech. The evidentiary use of speech proved motive or intent for hate crime does not constitutionally chill speech. I don't want to vote for an example that I think is at least one. I have a problem with. Let's go to no one else in the committee who's got their light on. Let's go to a vote on the Sessler Memories. Everybody, I'm sure what the memo is. All right, all those in favor of the Sessler Memories, please raise your hand. One, two, three, four, five. All opposed, like son, five, three, the memic carries. Any other amendments in the committee? Seeing that we're back to our line of motion due past now as amended by the committee. All those in favor of the motion, please raise your hand. Yeah, now we're voting underline bill itself as amended. So we're voting on the motion due past now as amended with the three amendments. You have a question, Senator Hatches. I just would like to address the author of the bill now that we're in this posture if he would like to comment on how he would wish the, I mean, can we can I ask that? That's a very good question. I should have done a new way. Representative Carson, the bill has been amended by the committee. Do you have any desires? What happens with the bill at this point? I would like to continue. If it's possible to continue working on it, but I would not be comfortable passing this as is. And it's simply because Ira is a well-known internationally recognized definition that Georgia now would be deviating. And so we would have this definition over 1100 different governmental entities, excuse me, US government, various states, various nations, most of the nations, if not all, in the EU. And now Georgia has a slightly different definition of anti-semitism. So I would, I would to answer your question, Mr. Chair, and to the Chairman, Chairman, I would say I would want to find a way to work on it or maybe push it to 24, but I would not be comfortable passing my good friend from Cobb County his his his wording because Georgia would be an outlier. All right. The motion to pass was made by Senator Watson. Do you let you weigh in? I can make motion to withdraw my depends. All right. Senator Watson has withdrawn his motion to pass. Now, I mean, is it required a second for that motion to withdraw? Or is it a motion to table or any objection from withdraw the motion to pass and the bill will be held by the Chairman. Any objection from the committee? All right. Senator Setsler. So the bills and the breast of the committee, first amendments were adopted and then as adopted, they were deleted by the third amendment, which was deleting line 1914 through 19. So what we have is the bill and the breast of committee with the amendment adopted to it. But I think the what would the posture be? We could move do pass as is. We could leave it in committee and we could adjourn without recommendation. Yeah. So the option is and I think the proper procedure then would be for a motion to table at this point, which take priority. And so there's a motion to table. I was just going to ask the question. I just just parenthetically I'm sensitive to. I mean, I'd like to make a motion to pass. All right. The motion to pass, let's do this. I'm going to follow the rules. Well, let me ask this, Mr. Chair. Here's what I'm sensitive to. I'm sensitive to it. This being attached, being in the breast of the committee being attached, being laid on the table. And we work in a covenantal and a kind of concilatory way amongst members here. I'm sensitive to. I'm sensitive to laying things on the table and then all of sudden conditions exist and the panel looks very different in a subsequent meeting and things all of sudden. Yeah, I've just sensitive to what can happen. So I'll defer to the chairs with. At this point, we do not have another committee being scheduled that's been noticed. We're running out of time and anticipate they'll be in their committee being scheduled. That said, I will state nothing prohibits if the rules are followed. I think it's 24 hour notice for a committee to be scheduled for a committee to be scheduled prior to Thursday morning. And nothing would prohibit the discretion of the chair at that point to notice the bill back on again, but that would take 24 hours of notice. But at this point, I'll entertain a motion to table the bill. We have a motion to table by Senator Perry to have a second. Have a second from Senator Jones. Any discussion on the motion to table? All those in favor of the motion, please raise your hand. It is unanimous. The bill currently sits on the table and is all pitched in a first night. Thank you. I know a lot of people have to clear the room. I'll give you a second if we move on to the next bill. If our committee wants to stick with us, we can wrap up tonight. Thank you. Okay. We will take a 60 second recess to everybody get out of the room. But that's all we're going to do. All right. All right. Nobody has to get out. But please work your way to the exit. We have other bills to here. If you can please take your conversations outside. Please take your conversations outside. We are moving on to House Bill 470. Chairwoman Cooper. A little bit off the agenda, but we're almost done. Whoa. I'm all of a sudden, a lot of my thoughts. If you have to have them, I guess. I don't know. Maybe good or bad for you. I don't know. We have House Bill 470 working off a substitute LC3395O2S. We have Chairwoman Cooper. And you have your sidekick for the evening. Dan Snipes with Georgia Trial Lawyers Association. And if you will please present to us House Bill 470. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. As you know, I'm not a lawyer. And so that is why I asked Mr. Snipes who has worked a little, gee, don't, don't, Lee, Scott, haven't had anything to drink and so on. We are all struggling, so you're good. So I think we'll try to be a little and a very positive thing about a little humor. If you have felt the urge shaking here at the Capitol lately, it is because we have an agreement between the trial lawyers, the doctors, and the hospitals. So the Capitol sort of shook when this happens. It isn't something that we worked on just this session. I think we're getting close to three years since the mention of candor came up. And House Bill 470 is known as the Georgia Candor Act, which brings a different approach to tort reform. Right now, what we have a system when there is an adverse health care outcome and a patient is injured in the hospital, there is a system of blame and shame, which leads to deny, defend, delay, and then litigation. And that's not very satisfactory for anybody. Certainly the patient that's had the adverse outcome. And for the doctors of their hospital or whoever made the mistake, they really are uncomfortable about it. And candor is a significant step in changing that culture to one of working together in a straightforward, honest, and transparent manner to help patients find a positive resolution to an adverse health outcome. And with that, if it's okay, I'll and I can add into, we'll let Mr. Snipes go over the bill legally for y'all. For the tort reform bill, Mr. Snipes. Oh, no. It's only a tiny little option. It's one little option. Senator Watson heard that. Make sure we only have one mic. And so it's a little awkward setup if you can lean over towards that. Be glad to. As Chair Cooper mentioned, the Jordan Health Advocates with Mary Lee Gober who's behind me first approach Georgia trial laws about this in 2019, I believe. Over time, we have taken what's been passed in Colorado and Iowa and used that legislation as a basis for what is House Bill 470. I'm going off of the LC339502S, which is the Committee substitute. And going through this bill, the first section 1.2 is the definitional section, on which provides definition for a notice that has to be provided when a candor imitation is sent. What, how candor differs? And I'm just going to try to go through this quickly. But how it differs from like a mediation, if you're trying to compare this to a mediation, is in a candor situation, a health care provider, when there's been an adverse incident, that a provider is the party that can initiate a candor discussion by sending an invitation. So that's where some of the phrases that are used in section 1.2 and what would be 24, 1240, goes to and defines those terms. 24, 12, 41 sets forth, what has to be contained in the invitation when the provider reaches out to the patient or the patient's representative. And then we get into, at the, the rest of that section gets into, if they do choose to go into a discussion, setting forth particularly how, what's going to be privileged within that discussion, what's protected from ever being admissible, and then it provides what's the benefit to the health care provider in the event that a matter is resolved. And that's going to be in lives 140 and 164. To go through, I've tried to do this relatively quickly given the time from the version that passed the house to two changes, we're starting at line 132. The, there is a tolling provision for unrepresented parties. So despite the fact that there is a notice provision which advises a patient or a patient's representative that you need to get counsel, if someone proceeds through this process unrepresented, there is a provision for a tolling of the statute of limitations while the candor process plays out because there are time restrictions in here. The candor notice invitation has to be sent within 150 days of the provider knowing of an adverse event. And then there's an initial 60 day period within which to have the candor discussion, but that period of time can be extended. The change that was made from the house version, starting in line 132, is to limit the tolling provisions to just the parties that are participating in the candor discussion. So if there were multiple health care providers engaged in care, and only one chooses to engage in the candor discussion, the tolling provisions only apply against the one party that chooses to participate. That's the change that the medical association Georgia requested. And then in talking through that because the hope is that these processes happen more quickly, this is a quick process. The tolling provision would not begin until after a year has elapsed from the date of the adverse event. The other change was on line 192, we added in the word or privileged there just to make it clear that there's nothing in this law that would change the current apology statute, current peer review statute, the attorney client privilege will work for audit doctorate. The other thing is it can't be used, the fact that a party or any party does not want to participate in candor. And this is strictly voluntary on everybody's part. No one is being forced to participate in candor. It's voluntary. And if somebody doesn't, the patient that was injured doesn't want to participate in the candor process. And it, you know, or that's not a good example. It's a doctor if a doctor doesn't want to participate in candor, and this should go to into a lawsuit. The fact that they didn't want to participate cannot be used against them as bad faith. So that was important. The other thing in tolling, the one group I didn't say that was in support of this, are the insurance people who, you know, supply the doctors with their malpractice. They were very concerned about tolling. So what happens is the discussions, if you don't have a lawyer to represent you, and you know, you can go up to a year's time trying to work it out. If it's not worked out within a year, the only reason tolling would ever start would be because both parties and all parties involved in working candor would agree to the tolling would start. It would have to be an agreement after that one year position. Is that? And I'll confess that I'm getting a little tired and I'd forgotten about that last change, about the failure to send an invitation can never be used as bad faith. The one additional change that I would bring before the committee today and ask for our friendly amendment is that the Georgia Health Advocates and Medical Association of Georgia have asked that lines 2021 be amended so that say family members, comma, friends, or facilitators. The Georgia Health Advocates has specifically requested that we add in the word facilitators and I think the proper way to do that would be family members, comma, friends, or facilitators. And I would like to add that, yeah, sometimes Georgia is always the last, we're not the last, nor are we the first to start doing candor. But in Colorado, which is a blue state, candor passed unanimously, Republicans and Democrats, in Iowa, which is a Republican state, candor passed unanimously. I don't know about all the states, I have more information about Colorado, but candor is working and it especially works and I think one of the reasons I'm concerned about the patients and often patients are injured, but their injuries often do not come and raise to a level that a lawyer would be able to take them and go into a big, huge trial because it's takes so much money and those trials run from three to five years. But when people have adverse affect reactions and are hurt and damaged some way, they often go unresolved because if they go to a lawyer, they'll just say, you know, the compensation would not be enough to pay for everything that has to be paid for to get ready to go to trial. So in many ways, this opens it up for more people to be able to resolve their situation than before. All right. You did not have any questions from the committee. It's one of the person, to people that's not to speak, someone called the speakers up. Jake, is it daily? Come on up, Jake, with GDLA, the other LA. Thank you very much. To be honest with everybody, it's a little bit of source of frustration for our organization that the GDLA is consulted frequently on bills like this, but our organization is not. So I just say that just to urge everybody, we're out there too. And if you ever care about, you know, our organization's input on on bills, we're always happy to to provide it and to help with drafting. I have to first, and let me first say, I practice law with Freeman, Mathis and Gary, but I'm specifically here in my capacity as the chair of the legislation committee for GDLA, not here on behalf of my firm. So just GDLA is what I'm here for. Excuse me, the principle issue that we have with this bill is that in my view, what Mr. Snipe said is not entirely true about the proposed code section that would preserve the privilege. And that is because there's frankly, you know, right off the bat in proposed code section 24-12. Excuse me, I'm supposed to place 41-D. It specifically says that there shall not be the protections provided in subsections A and D of code section 24-12-43. Which one are you on? I'm sorry. 112 carried over from 110 and 111. For us, you say the line number always helps us follow. Sure. So the carryover from 110 and 111 onto the next page 112 and 111. 13 is what specifically says the protections afforded in the subsequent part about preserving privilege, etc. Do not apply if you violate the term

terms of the open discussion and rotation. And while that might not seem so unreasonable, just, you know, in the abstract, I point out that in a subsection, sorry, let me give the line numbers, lines starting at line 90, three, there is a prescribed notice that, well, I should back up to line 91, that says this notice has to be given in at least 16 point aerial font and placed at least two inches apart from any other text. Well, what if due to a formatting mistake, it's in 15 point aerial, 1.9 inches away from any other text? The privilege is lost at that point. And privilege once lost is irrevocable. You can't put the toothpaste back in the tube, so to say. And so, you know, we face a situation here where you could, you could lose the privilege and then once that happens, somebody said, well, you know, I don't really want this deal anymore. Because now that I've got your privileged information under this law, I can use it in a subsequent lawsuit. And I've got your admission, basically, you know, on hand, you've admitted it to us. And now I can use that against you. George Law has always said that settlement discussions and offers of apology are not admissible. Those are currently in the evidence code, OCGA section 24-4-407 and dash 408. You cannot use evidence relating to discussions of settlement or offers of apology to prove liability and underlying lawsuit. And this law would do away with those in this particular context. The reason why that's always been the law is because of the obvious prejudice that would occur to a defendant in that position. If you say, how about if I give you $100,000 for your claim and that goes in front of a jury? I mean, it's over at that point. There's no point in even defending the lawsuit at that point. The peer review and medical records privileges, if I can direct your attention to lines starting at line 123, this is a requirement that the healthcare provider or the health facility shall essentially investigate the claim and then the troubling language in our view is disclose the results of such investigation to the patient. That's lines 125 and 126. The definition section does not define, disclose the results. That could be very narrow, such as the following was the final decision of the committee that reviewed this. There was an error, there was no error. Something as simple as that. Disclose the results could also mean give us everything that was ever discussed, all documents, emails, reports, et cetera, et cetera that went into this finding. That would absolutely destroy the peer review privilege or the medical records privilege that this law supposedly says it's maintaining in violet. And so, this is another problematic provision and I frankly don't know how to suggest amending it. There's a lot of problems with that. I mean, the first and foremost, I would suggest changing lines 112 and 113 to say that under no circumstances, shall any of this be admissible in evidence and it shall always maintain the protection set forth in subsections A and D of code section 24-12-43. At a minimum, that would be, I think, what would be necessary to make this bill even remotely fair. And the consequence of all this is that frankly, I would never recommend to a client that they utilize this procedure. I don't know why it's necessary. Everything that goes on in here can happen currently. I mean, there's no prohibition on pre-settlement discussions. That happens all the time. So a bill is not necessary to allow that. This is, you know, there's one positive in this that I see to the doctors and that is that it won't count as a claim on their record for purposes of the composite board, I suppose, is what it would be for. But otherwise, the dangers of this are so great that I think it would be almost malpractice for a defense lawyer to recommend that this procedure be utilized because just one little slip up and everything is gone. You have to give it to the other side. A couple more modest issues if I may. You do have one question for the Senate, Patrick. So I just want to point something out. I understand some of your concern, but the lines 112 or 110 and 111, an open discussion invitation to patient that fails to comply with this subsection of the code shall be admissible and shall not have the legal protections. They're only talking about the invitation and the invitation is defined in the bill already online 45. So just the written notice would be admissible. Not the discovery, not the communications that may happen at a settlement conference. They're just talking about the invitation. Or at least that's my interpretation of that. Do you agree? I don't. I mean, that invitation, excuse me. Correct. I don't agree and that's because I go down to line 123. You are forced to disclose the results of your investigation. So as the doctor or hospital, you have to investigate then what happened? You go through this elaborate procedure that hospitals have with peer review of the situation, all of that. And you have to give that over to the other side then. And there's nothing that says that they can't use that against you if you commit some just insignificant violation of this process. And we've seen in the context of time limited demands that I'm sure you've all been confronted with on some of those bills. There are people out there who will try to use this to their advantage. I'm not trying to cast a wide too wide of a net on that. But that happens with the time limited demand statute. It's sort of a game of gotcha. And I can easily see that happening with this bill. And yes, it is voluntary. But if it's useless and too dangerous, what's the point of passing a bill that is not necessary can be a, can, can, you know, things can occur without it. And it's so, it's so potentially dangerous that, you know, some doctors and hospitals wouldn't want to use it. There's also some issues with respect to the notification that is required to be given, especially to pro-say lit against. If you are required to tell them things about statute of limitations, it's one thing to say there is a statute of limitations. But going beyond that, think about to, two, three years ago now, when the Supreme Court stayed all deadlines, including statutes of limitation for a period of 122 days, there was debate over what that meant exactly. This bill, I think, puts defense lawyers in the position of having to give legal advice to people that they do not have an attorney-client relationship with. And that's just asking for trouble. If you have another question, Senator Watson. Is there any way that you can correct this? I mean, in line 10, if you add in there that an open discussion invitation to the patient that fails to comply, to substantially comply with subsection C, means that, is that loosening it too much or is that... What line are you on? You said line 10, I'm sorry. One 10. One 10. 110. Thank you. I had the same issue. So you would say substantially fail? Well, it's substantially comply with subsection C of this code section, shall? I mean... The thing that makes me personally afraid about language like that is that that sort of means nothing. That means whatever the judge you have means until the cases go up to the appellate courts and they put some parameters on it. But I mean, it's so risky in my mind that something will or won't be deemed as a substantial compliance. And, you know, is that a jury question or not? You know, just sort of adds to the complexity of that issue. I mean, like I said, the primary thing if the bill was going to go through that I would urge the committee to consider is just a flat out, none of this is admissible period. The problem is, is that some of it's going to be disclosed and you can't take it back once it's disclosed. You can't make the plan of, you know, or his or her attorney forget the information that you've given them. All right, Mr. Adelaide, let's you wrap up and we have one of the first time to speed you. Okay. The other issue I want to point out too is with respect to this notice that starts online 54 and carries over to 69 is we get into the notion of the claims of leans and Medicare and Medicaid and all of that and whether the plaintiff is legally allowed to represent him or herself and, you know, things like that. The problem is those things all need to happen up front. And with this, you don't know if you have a valid settlement until after the deal is struck. And then you have to start talking about these things, whereas in the normal course, these things are discussed and handled up front. For example, you have a case involving a settlement with a minor. Usually the parent will be that minor is representative but not always. And so you can negotiate a deal, then have the probate court step in and say, so and so is the point of the conservator of this minor. And then that person says, I don't want anything to do with this deal. I don't like it. You know, where are we then? Again, we've had these forced disclosures of critical information that could be very, very damaging and then it just goes away. So I don't, I mean, I think it's a well-intentioned bill. I don't think it's necessary because this can all happen currently. And so, you know, it's admittedly voluntary and that plays a part in it. But I think it needs some work because there's some serious problems with privileges and confidentiality and unauthorized practice of law type issues. So I'd urge the committee to take a much, much closer look at that. Is your association opposed to the bill? Are you speaking on their behalf as well? Okay. All right, you know, there are questions for Mr. Dele. All right, thank you. Thank you very much. Appreciate your time. Last speaker we have is Bethany Scher, from Medical Association of Georgia. Good evening. Good evening. As you said, I'm Bethany Scher with the Medical Association of Georgia. We're here in support of HP470. And first one, I thank everyone for their work on this. I know it has been a long process. I think I first heard about candor when I was in law school and that was not super recently. So this has certainly been a topic of conversation around the Medical Association and some of the other parties for a long time. As all things do, it has evolved since that time. I think that we've gotten to a point where we substantially have a bill that all sides can support. Candor is a fantastic tool for the practices that want to use it. I do think that it can significantly increase physicians kind of overall well-being when they can get to a place with their patients. Before we get to court, and hopefully you actually maintain that relationship afterwards, especially when something is just an unexpected outcome versus it being an actual malpractice situation. So we have patients who experience an unexpected outcome. And oftentimes what they go to a lawyer to do is to find out what happened. They just need to know why this happened to me. And sometimes there's an explainable medical reason for why something happens. And this allows that patient to actually get to that information in a protected environment. I empathize with some of the discussion about the need to be careful about how these notices are done. And I think that there are a number of discussions we could have about that. I actually agree with you Senator Hatchett about how that would read. I do believe that it would just be the notice that would then be able to be disclosed. I am not a practicing trial attorney, but as I read it and interpret the legislation, I don't believe that it would be the entirety of the discussion. That would then be admissible in court later. So thank you, and we are in support of this bill. All right, any questions in the committee? Thank you. Thank you. All right, it's everyone assigned to speak on the bill. What is the pleasure of the committee? Motion to pass by Senator Hatchett. Do we have a second? Second from Senator Jones. Do we have any discussion? We have a minute. Step on it. That's right. You told us, and I wrote it down, it was going to be online 20, to strike the or, and online 21, to put comma or facilitators. Yes, sir. Period. Is that correct? We have a motion from Senator Sessor. We have a second. Second for Senator Jones. Any discussion? All those in favor of the amendment? Please say aye. Aye. It is unanimous. Any other amendments in the committee? Senator Watson. Dr. Watson. Senator Snipes, do you have any thoughts on the substantially portion of that line? Yes, sir. Yet that might put over. Yes, sir. So what we're talking about, though, is that the open invitation discussion has to include three things to begin on line 78. I've just seen four things. Has four things that begin on line 78. A reference to the patient has to be entitled to receive a complete copy of their medical records. A notice, and it doesn't say when the statute runs. It just says that there is a limited time period. And just because you engage in discussion, that does not cause it to be extended. The third thing is that if it's a entity that subjects in an analyte of notice that that doesn't change to deadline for when you have to send an analyte of notice, because that's typically usually different, they want a statute of limitation of expire. And then the fourth thing is just a very clear notice of you have to include this notice about a right to an attorney. And the only way the open invitation would then not be subject to privilege and somehow be admissible if you just don't do those four things. But in working with the attorneys for the Medical Association of Georgia, and working with the attorneys for resurgence or the pedics, and working with the other, any degree, Piedemont's been involved in this. Other groups have been involved in this. They recognize that if we're going to send out this open invitation discussion, which may result in a patient at some point, resolving a case and saying, I'm giving up all my legal rights to ever pursue a claim about this, that we have to give them these four things at the beginning when they're not represented by a council at that time. So this part of that language where the open discussion invitation has to include those four things, has been the result of a lot of negotiation that has occurred over the last two years. And that's how we came to this point. It wasn't, it wasn't happenstance. It was something that was a lot of back and forth on. Bottom line, you don't think substantially is needed. No, sir. Question from Senator Satsun. Hope that's a quick question. All these things, whether it's the 16 point area falling above, I mean, are these things fairly broadly construed? Is there anything where this is just strictly construed? I mean, the people that are going to be doing this are going to be rep, I mean, the providers are going to be sending this, aren't sending these out willy-nilly. They're going to have people advising them and they're going to be able to comply with these four things. I think relatively easily, I think that's the reason why the medicalist groups who have been involved in this agree with these terms. All right, we have a motion due pass by committee. Substitute now as amended. It's been second. Any further discussion? All those in favor of the motion, please raise your hand. It is unanimous. The doctors and lawyers celebrating together. I have to make the capital move a little. I moved a little. All right, thank you. Thank you very much. All right, we are going to try to quickly wrap up on no folks have waited for these bills, but maybe not this one, House Bill 219, Representative Hilton looks like nobody signed up an opposition to your bill. Well, let us know, we're going to read it. Famous last words. Famous last words. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Wait, I'm getting some text, where a few people coming in want to speak. All right, this is where we get dangerous. So let's stay on track. We're looking at House Bill 219. Yes. We are. Hold on one second. Go for it. All right, Representative Cooper, we got you out. Come on. We asked for it. Representative Cooper out of the room. Representative. You're not going to do it, yeah. You know, I was apologizing because I personally had not known about the citizens. That's okay. This stuff happens all the time around here. Thank you. All right. She's my chair in public health and said she had a quick bill. So I'm going to go first. Yeah. Working off of LC4800101S as passed by the House. Yes. The floor is yours. Awesome. Thank you. Good evening to the hardest working committee in the General Assembly. Appreciate you, Mr. Chair. Committee here to present to you a financial crime bill. And I'm not talking about credit Swiss or Silicon Valley bank. This has to do with jurisdictional issues. So the law is kind of catching up to how we handle money now. Fafft in the old days, you had someone next to you. You stole their money. You're right there. We prosecute you right here. Now money moves electronically. And so the bill is real simple. Two pages, two sections. Section number one deals with money laundering. Section number two deals with FFT. Both prosecuting attorneys, counsel, and Gactel have worked very closely. I appreciate Ms. Travis and her input. They've both laid hands on this and like it. It was passed nearly unanimously in the House. And it has to do with venue. So all of us have gotten that email. Click on the link. Your money's gone. We can't prosecute that person. We typically refer the case to where that criminal is located. They then basically gave that criminal referral and followed away. And nothing really happens. This changes the venue to where the victim is here in Georgia, allowing the victims to receive justice here in Georgia. I'm married to lawyer, but I brought my non-lawyer spouse with me to answer health answering questions. Mr. Will Johnson from the prosecuting attorneys counsel. Thanks for joining us. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, and I'm honored. You want us to pass it. I think he covered it perfectly. I'm sure to answer questions. Any questions from Mr. Johnson or Representative Hilton? Nobody else has signed his speech on the bill. What's the pleasure? Do we have a pleasure to committee? How do we do have a question? Senator Sessler. Real quick. Love it. Love the venue piece where the victim's located. I guess the question is, in practice, I hope this solves a problem, because I think people are getting victimized this way. In practice, how does our prosecutorial system in Georgia going to make these address these things? So right now, currently, it would be where the defendant is located or where the defendant takes possession of the money. That would be where we have to prosecute it. So this would allow us to prosecute it locally, where the victim is, or where an act was performed in furtherance. That would allow us, instead of sending the case wherever the defendant is located, or having no venue at all if there's another conflicting statute, we can charge and indict the case in the county where it occurred here, and then extradite the defendant back. Is that work across state loans? Yes. Good does. OK. Cool. All right. No other questions from the committee? What's the pleasure of the committee? Motion to pass by Senator Sessler, a second for Senator Parent. He's discussion. All those in favor, the motion, please say aye. It is unanimous. Who's carrying it in the Senate? Senator Albers. Senator Albers? OK. All right. Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you. I'm sorry. Yeah. OK. We have two bills left. Next, House Bill 563. Representative Levere. We are working off of LC442294. You'll introduce your guests. There's no one else that's on the speak on the bill. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. With me tonight is Director Alana Cross, the Director of the Commission on Equal Opportunity, which House Bill 563 concerns. That's all you had to say. I know I got about 60 more seconds. OK. Just was white and white and sure I was recognized. So House Bill 563 amends the Fair Employment Practices Act of 1978. That act actually created the Commission on Equal Opportunity. We've got two general assembly members that are former members, Representative Ray Martinez, and Chairman Anne of Attarady. The Commission basically enforces federal civil rights laws within state employment. They provide a forum in which someone who believes they've been the victim of discrimination and convict complaint. The Commission will investigate the complaint and make an initial sort of probable cause determination. If they determine there's probable cause that discrimination did occur, they would attempt to conciliate or mediate the complaint. If they can't, they then provide a hearing structure for the person to have their complaint heard. Currently they appoint a private attorney from a list they maintain as a special master. That's the type of hearing officer we have. The system works very well, but it's expensive. And so what we're trying to do with 563 is change from that somewhat unique special master proceeding to having hearings before the Office of State and Administrative hearings. And you would have just an ALJ or a hearing officer from that department here at the complaint. We also in here, and the one exception is of course, if OSAH is the respondent, then they would still have a special master appointed. There are also some provisions in here with regard to compelling testimony and discovery, allowing the amendment of complaints, which currently is not considered to be permitted under the existing statute. And there's a provision in here that deals with some periodic reporting they do while the complaint's pending. It tries to simplify that process and reduce the number of letters they have to send confirming that your complaint is still being investigated. And that's basically the bill I'll of direct cross, which is to- Good evening, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Lonna Cross and I serve as the Executive Director of the George Commission on Equal Opportunity, Office of the Governor. It's pleasure to be here with you all this afternoon with this evening. I will be very brief with my remarks as Representative Levers stated, the bill is essentially clean up legislation. The act has not been amended to our knowledge since 1978. And as you all can imagine, the need to improve in a mere changes in procedures and processes is vital to ensure that the equal employment division can continue to function and operate effectively. Amending the act will allow for administrative and procedural changes that will equate to a more efficient complaint process. Not only for GCO employees, but all state employees, all state agencies, colleges and universities, and Georgia citizens. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to answering any questions you may have. Thank you, Director. Cross, Representative Levers, any questions from the committee? Do not have any questions. No one else ought to speak on the bill. What's the pleasure of the committee? Motion to very enthusiastic. Motion to pass from Senator Jones. Not consumed legislatively at time in 45 years. You should be. That's right. Do you want to take a little longer on it? Okay. Motion to pass from Senator Jones a second from Senator Setsler. Any discussion, all those in favor in the motion? Please say aye. Aye. It is unanimous. Who is carrying this one? Chairman Ambitar. All right. Chairman Ambitar. I have a commission. All right. Thank you. Thank you all for staying so late. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Are you finally done with our committee? I believe this concludes it. And how many bills do we move viewers in our committee? Six. Wow. One committee. Thank you. Thank you all very much. Thank you. All right. Last bill in the agenda. Chairman Chokus, House Bill 5.05. We're working off the version that passed in the House. LC480853. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And members of the committee, the hour is late. Now be brief. This bill simply does two things. It changes the offense that's currently on the books of riot from a punishable by a felony instead of a misdemeanor. And then the second thing that it adds to riot to the offense of bailable offenses and the bail, of course, would be set by a spirit court judge. That's all that it does, sir. All right. Any questions for the author? Others have said I was speaking on the bill. Any questions for the author at this time? All right. So we have three folks. Thank you. If you want to sit tight, we'll bring the other speakers up. James Woodall with Southern Center for Human Rights. You've been waiting all evening for this. Yeah. Yes, Mr. Chairman. I'll be joined by our intern, author Murphy, who's a 3-A-L at Georgia State University. Evening? Good night, whatever. So I'll be very brief, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. So we have concerns about this bill. One, we're posed because punishment that this bill seats to address already exists in the code. And so when you think about a connoisseur that's associated with writing, such as assaults, batteries, destruction of property, theft, criminal trespass, arson, afraid of destruction of roadways, domestic terrorism, as well as affiliates of follow-up police orders. All of those are already criminalized. Secondly, we'll talk about the ways other states punish writing as proposed in this legislation. Hospital follow-up filed with make Georgia. One of the only states in the region to punish writing, as a felony. In fact, Alabama, Arkansas, and Tennessee use this punishment for writing as a misdemeanor. Even more compared to Georgia, these states would require more severe elements to be proven before someone could be convicted of violating the right of fence.

activity like creating a grave danger to the public, causing public alarm, damaging property, injuring a person, or even obstructing some governmental function as an element of those riot offenses. Some states like North Carolina, Virginia though, only punished rioting as a felony when there are aggravating factors like weapons or substance or property damage. Other states like Mississippi have no codifier riot offense at all. The last thing we'll say is according to this prime court of Georgia under Georgia's code, all persons connected with and sharing in the common purpose of a riot is assembly our guilty of riot. Court of Court, even if their conduct is not violent or tumultuous. For instance, in Fisher V State, the court hailed a guilty conviction of a riot for a man who merely stood in a crowd which protested the arrest of another and used violent, threatening, and profane language. Thus, because Georgia's riot statute is already used to co-op protest, this legislation would only make it easier to charge protestors with felonies. Mr. Chairman, I know others will be coming to the speech of this, so I'll pause there. You don't have any questions, thank you. Next we have Ben Lyne from ACLU of Georgia. Welcome back, Ben. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Members of the committee, I'm gonna try to be as brief as possible, because I told my fiance that I pick her up at five to take her home today. So, five PM? Five PM, so I am. I'm gonna be asleep on the couch, but this is a bill that was worth staying for because this is important. It's funny as that is. What I wanna talk about in this bill is, I don't wanna build too much, I don't know gagged, I was gonna come right behind me and kind of cure up anything that I say that's too simple, but there's simply no justification for criminalizing protestes, particularly when the bill subject protesters to a 20 year prison sentence. While the intent of the bill may not be chill speech or protest, we oppose HB 505 because the bill is drafted would do exactly that. While the bill may suggest that it only targets those engaged in crimes of violence, this bill expressly contemplates non criminal conduct. Lines 11 or 12 talks about an on-lawful act of violence or any other act that's committed in a violent or tumultuous manner. Now, that's kind of the crux of what this issue is because I don't think there is a way to define violent or tumultuous manner. It's not defined anywhere in Georgia code. It is, we do have some case law to quote the late Scalia some musty and dusty case law that we can look to. The most seminal case is Green versus State, which is a 1900 case. When they looked at violent or tumultuous, what they looked to other states when they had defined it and defined it as certain examples, such as persons conducting a chivalry, a serenade with bells, horns, or tin pans, or guilty of a riot, or another case where singing songs and huluing are guilty of a riot. And the case law just goes on and on like that. We're trying to contextualize what is this disturbance that rises to the level of riot. And the case law does so, and some things that I think some members of this committee might find very interesting is that if you have two or more people who are assembled with arms in protesting, that is a riot, expressly under Georgia code. I mean, under Georgia case law, and again, that's Green versus State, and I can give that citation. It's a 1-9, Georgia 536. And that was when I tried to define that code. Way I know most of you people is that I had an opportunity to work in the Senate research office, so I was a person who would have been telling you trying to define what this means. And I just looked at the case law, and that's kind of where we're at. And we don't believe that there's any way that when we have such a loose definition of this otherwise non-criminal conduct to put a 20-year prison sentence, when other bills come up that are especially touching on protest, we have really defined this is what is going to make it a felony offense, these specific acts, and it goes through committee process, and we can kind of talk about whether or not that's something that's going to chill speech or not. But just to say two or more people, and an act, which is otherwise lawful, that's done in a violent, tumultuous manner, now that's a felony, and it's a felony that's punishable by 20 years in prison. This bill is not ready for the floor in that current form. It needs a lot more work in the sense of finding out what are these discrete things that make up what was otherwise belawful protest, something so criminal, as it would warrant 20 years in prison. That's, like I said, I want to make a short, so that's kind of what I have to say, and I'll stand for any questions. You do have some questions, I'll ask the first one, in the house that you also speaking, obviously, Bill. Did you recall any previous versions of the bill or any discussion of the house about the definition of riot? I don't remember anything. No one was able to look to anything concrete to find out what that actually means. It is my recollection, and I'm sure that the author of the bill will correct me. Okay, hit from me. All right, you have other questions, Senator Hatchett. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I know it's late, but I want to make sure we're careful here, and I just kind of want your opinion on this. If you look at lines 11 and 12, Yes. If two people get, I'm going to ask a couple, hypotheticals, if two people get into a fight, that's obviously violent. They're fighting each other, but that's technically, even if it's with their fist, that would be technically considered a riot. And what's problematic about that is, yes, there's a violent act that amud between those two people, and we can look at that and say, well, that's a criminal conduct, and maybe we should be looking at. But under the express language of that statute, everyone who remains at a protest, that it includes that fight between those two people, are now subjected to 20 years in prison under the way we evaluate case law. All right, and then I kind of looked up the definition of tumultuous, and just one of the definitions is just loud. Right. So for me and a friend are hunting, and we actually only get on somebody else's property and shoot a deer, for example. Am I going to be charged with the rioting? If, if, oh, now the question would be, whether or not your friend who was in the woods also fired a weapon in public, whether or not it would take that to qualify it, but yes, what we're talking about, and I think those two examples that I read from Green versus State, I think are really illustrative, because that's what it is, it's being loud, you know? And, and excited. Excuse me? Or another definition is just excited. And that could, and that is the vagueness, and I don't think the law as it is right now, it's not clear enough, it's not clear enough, I think right now, and I practice in front of a pure court judge who would say that this law already is unconstitutional, just hasn't made his way up to being challenged yet, but looking at this vague terms, it's one thing if it's a misdemeanor, if it's a felony that covers 20 years in prison, we need to look a lot more at it before we pass a lot like this. Thank you. Said or Jones? I think you're right, I'm being sure, so I'll piggyback him. Oh, sorry. Yeah. piggyback on the question there. If you look at power versus state, which is 218 Georgia at 556, it was dealing with inciting the riot, right? But basically what happened was, God got mad at somebody, he encouraged somebody to jump on somebody, and he was encouraging them to do the jump, and said they got him for inciting the riot. But let's say that he encourages somebody to jump on somebody, and then he threw a punch at the same person. Would that not be a riot? It's a fight. I believe it would be. And what's different between this is, it really gets into question between like, what is an afraid, which is already I think a constitutionally suspect statute as well, and what is riot? It's so nebulous. And nebulous has another word in the criminal context, which is void for vagueness. And well, if I, what other, I would also make the point that, I don't even know it's really that nebulous because he was charged with inciting the riot, and the court pointed out that what he was inciting was a fight, right? And that the evidence was conclusive that he was inciting the riot. Right. By saying, go jump on that person, I'm mad at him, they jumped on him. He was charged with inciting the riot. If he then jumps in it for whatever reason, there's no, he's going to be charged. He could be charged with a riot and get 20 years. Absolutely. Yes. All right. Senator Satsun. Yeah, I would just say to the point, I mean, a lot of what we're talking about here is things you shouldn't do. Say there's a, I've seen a, I've seen a riot in a soccer match, right? In fact, my mother-in-law was, I won't get in all that. She was shocked to see two crowds clashing with each other. I mean, you've got, you've got 50 of these thug, drunk fugs and these drunk fugs attacking each other and throwing bottles and stuff. That's not legal. Shouldn't be. But it should be a 120 felony. That's the question. What I take on these kind of things is, you do stuff like that, you go to jail, you do stuff like that, should you go to prison. And that's what I'm wrestling with here. And not to belabor a point, but just having one two national championships in the past two years and hoping that we do that every year, successively, till I leave this earth, I don't want a bunch of UGA kids in celebratory masses after winning it. Right in the law doing stupid stuff. Which, which, which ordinarily might spend time in a drunk take, but not understanding the consequences is now they're liable to spend 20 years in prison. All right. Thank you. Mr. Van Meter, do you have anything you want to add for what we, do you want to close us out? Yes. This curtain. I know it's late. I really appreciate your patience. It's been a long day for all of us. But this is, the implication of a felony in someone's life is a really important thing. And the ripple effects that go from it are they're broad and they're vast. And we will try to be brief, of course. It's worth noting that in the context of the code, you're looking at this writing statute. It's followed by 161131, which is actually inciting a riot. A person who with the intent to riot encourages the conduct, which urges, counsels, advises someone to riot. It's clear that inciting a riot requires the intent that the person accused of it be trying to actually see a riot come to pass. It's a misdemeanor. So if you're going to elevate the crime of riot to a felony, when we've talked about the examples that we've talked about here today about how theoretically easy it is or would be if this bill is passed to then be in a riot a situation. Believe me, I'm not here asking you to raise the other one to a felony, too. But let's be at least consistent in the way we think about our code. And when this bill was brought before the House Public Safety Committee, it was brought in concert with the arson bill you heard earlier this evening. And it was clearly articulated in that conversation that that was purposeful. Also at that time, a discussion happened about what does constitute violent and tumultuous manner. And that included commentary that we know was first introduced into the legal lexicon as a characterization of pornography by Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart. This idea that you know it when you see it. Nowhere near a standard by which a court should measure and assess the concept of violent or tumultuous. Nowhere near a constitutional standard by which someone should have their liberty removed from them for up to 20 years. This needs to be a more exacting definition before you're going to expose someone to this. I won't belabor you with it, but if you are, there is the history on this bill. I mean, that's history on this law goes back to 1833. There has not been kind of like we've heard another, I've said another conversations. This is not a code section that has been litigated very often. This is, and you know Mr. Van Meter Chairman. Jordan Van Meter has been looking into this for us also. And if you had anything we want to add about the constitutionality we'd love to. Just briefly. Thank you. Very little. My predecessor said, covered the premise very well. But to answer your question about deer hunting and could you be charged, I think that's kind of a really important point. And the way I would have answered it, sir, is that can you be charged with the offense depends on the motivations of your adversary? And that is why when you are dealing with language and a criminal statute that gives powers of motivated people, adversaries, people with political ambitions or certain views of the world, etc. It gives them leverages of power that perhaps they shouldn't have or that they might not use fairly, because no one is perfect. I'm speaking as a former prosecutor myself who am in private practice now helping people who are going or working through being charged with felonies over stuff that when I was, for Connick that I engaged in when I was there age and things of that nature just because of the circumstances that got them into my office. The caution I would ask this committee to take is to tread carefully when you're looking at the language and how broad it is. It is, there's not a lot of specifics here. The very next code section, as Maiselin talked about, is obviously a riot code section. It's about a specific time, a specific goal, a specific method of behavior, and it's still a misdemeanor. What troubles me about this code section making and a felony is that it is broad and open to any interpretation of anybody who wants to use it. A lot of the conduct could be, you're talking about juvenile college-a students, you might have a blemish on their record and otherwise people who could have gone on to have good careers and now they have to deal with something stupid from their teenage or college years maybe the go to the juvenile system. There's just more, my criticism of the bill as it is, is that it's not finished. There's more work that should be done so that the ramifications that are curtailed and keeping with the duty of passing laws that are narrowly tailored, which I think is a particular importance when you're dealing with conduct that many times involve speech. So that's all I can really say about the bill. I think it's not finished in these more work. All right, thank you all. Chairman Chokis, I think the bill is just gonna need some more work. You've heard the obvious concerns expressed from the committee, in particular, you're not redefining the word riot and you've heard concerns about the lack of case law interpreting the vague language in front of us. So I think before we take any action on this, that we're gonna need to have some better understanding as to how this is not to vague the way it's currently written before we raise this to a felony. And so I'm gonna not take any emotions on it tonight, which means the bill will still be alive, but I won't move from the committee at this time. You have anything you wanna add for, we close it out. Come up here. Oh, man. Sure. Let me give you two minutes if you can. I know you waited all night, so that's why I wanted to do that. I think the way it goes. The riot is defined in the code section now, 16-11, that's 30. We're not changing the definition. It says, two or more persons who shall do an unlawful act of violence. And any other act in a violent and tumultuous manner commit the offense of violence. That is in code section right now. And then they mentioned case law, riot requires common intent and concert of action in reference to the senators thing getting in a brawl, they have to work together, not against each other. And that's case law, loomers versus state, more case law, crime of riot requires, crime of actions of two or more persons, freeing from a common intent. And that's Dixon versus state. So the case law exists in defining riot as common intent. It's not a brawl, it's not two people getting in the woods and firing shots at a deer. It's two people or more working in concert to create a violent action, violent action. And that's what that does and that's already defined in case law. And then as I said, I've got the definition of right. The only thing this bill does is changes the penalty from a misdemeanor to a felony and we're choir and elected superior court judge to determine bail. That's all it does. All right. Thank you for allowing yourself. Thank you, Chairman. Appreciate you. All right, thank you with that. We have Reptabar Agenda and we are adjourned. Thank you.
