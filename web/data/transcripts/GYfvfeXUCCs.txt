TRANSCRIPT
----------
You
It is 3 o'clock and we have a busy agenda.
Senator Rhett, would you do the invocation for us?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Chairman.
Bow our heads.
Oh, Lord, we thank you for this day.
Another day's journey, and we're glad about it because we have the opportunity to do the
people's work.
Give us your guidance and wisdom, hold our hands, walk with us as we move forward and try
I make Georgia a better place to live for all Georgians.
We ask this to Christ our Lord, Amen, and Amen.
Amen.
All right, the first bill we're going to call today
was one that was left over from before
with Representative Mitchell Skoggins.
That's going to be, you have to go back.
I think they're in the numerical order and pull out 290.
So when you've got a copy of this and give me your LC number just to be sure we're the
same.
I think just that last section where we were looking at the
the wordage. All right. So we wouldn't in that year be their
term of office. Okay. So instead of it being the I think before it
could be interpreted to say it would be that year contract year this
would be their term of office.
So if they've got a contract in place for a four-year term, it would stay in place for
the four-year term.
And anybody that wasn't here at the previous meeting, this is dealing with the tax commissioners
that has language that says that the fees they get will be no more than 50% of their base
salary and that it will be a three-way negotiation with the county commission, the tax commissioner
and the entities that they're wanting to collect the taxes.
Any other questions by anybody?
If there's no question, Senator Hickman's move
that we do pass the Substitute to Hospital 290,
is there a second?
Second by Senator Alvers.
All in favor, raise your hand.
All right, I don't see any opposed.
Passes unanimously.
All right. We're going to move Representative Crow's 101 got split up a little bit. So if
you'll pull out your package on 504 and I'll kind of explain what's going on there.
I think 504 may be in between somewhere.
You said you put it behind 170 or?
570, 770.
OK.
OK, so that's 170.
504 is just behind the audit note on 170.
And just behind that, then, is the audit on the original bill from Chairman Hatchett
over there.
And this audit is not going to be good for this bill, but I want to explain here.
Chairman Hatchett had a change he wanted to make to a free port, and he didn't feel
I like it would be a very significant amount of money.
And we said, well, we need the fiscal note on the check and see.
We got the fiscal note back, and it's about $300 million.
And Chairman Hatchett said, never mind, don't hear my bill.
So because of that, what we have done trying to get some stuff
through is we put on there the hospital tax credit.
And the five million for the public school foundation
tax credit.
And I'll further say that the original hospital bill
had it going from $75 to $80 million.
We're trying to save those discussions for the office session.
So this will stay at $75 million.
There was some language they needed
that would clarify which hospitals are eligible
and would match the federal definition.
So that has been left in.
The, there was some information there
about raising the corporate from 10 to 25
and we're going to save that for the off session as well.
And then you'll see in there in keeping
with the administration's request on Perry on Sunset's
that we repeal it on December 31, 2026.
And let me make sure, because we have changes,
that both sections are subject to that, aren't they, or?
Okay.
So it's really not changing much on the hospital part,
or the other one's not changing at all.
The only change on the hospital part is some language
that would make it match the federal language
that we need, and the two would both sunset at 2026.
December 31st, 2026.
Any questions from the committee center albers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman
The rural hospital tax credit. I know it's been quite successful. My question is now that the great work has been done by Commissioner
Noggle in order to
Have a full payment on especially those Medicaid Medicaid costs
I'm wondering what the long term need for this is any more once we get to that level.
I don't know if anybody here today could speak to that, but it seems like where they
suffered in years past that they may not be suffering any more and do we need to have
this in addition to?
Okay.
I don't know if anybody from the hospital association wants to speak to that or not.
I know my, let's see, we just now got the sign up sheet over here.
Let me see what we've got.
Yeah, go ahead, Senator Avin, to address Mr. Senator Albert.
Now, I've actually had a hospital to admire you, it says that the Medicaid thing to refer
to is not going to be very good for them.
It's not going to take them, you know, like we got a hospital to admire you, it's getting
a million half, two million dollars with the tax credits.
And I don't know if that's across the board or just not
or what is it, but I have had that conversation with.
Thank you.
I noticed there's a number of people who have signed up
on 101.
If you're interested in either one of these sections in here,
you know, you can speak on this.
But this is dealing with the Royal Hospital Tax Credit
and the five million public school tax credit
that Brooks Culliman had started.
I think from my knowledge of hospitals,
I think you've got a valid point in that they're getting
1.7 billion more money with this direct pay,
which we've worked on.
The total uncompensated with energy and care
and low rates and everything is probably around 6 billion.
So from my perspective, you know, you're partially right on that.
My only thinking was we were kind of having a big study that we would do a short sunset,
not raise it and look at it from that standpoint.
But it's certainly the will of the committee.
Senator Hodges, your number, what number are you, okay, there you are.
Thank you, Ms. Chairman.
I was just gonna mirror what Senator Hickman was saying.
I'm told by the only hospital in my district
that the difference in this program is really minimal.
For them and their net revenues of about $500 million.
So with about an 80 to 90 million uncompensated care package.
That's helpful.
I think maybe we could have Chairman Watson
some time over the summer help us to figure out what they're going to do.
Thank you.
All right.
Everybody understand the bill and what we've got in here and those in the audience too.
It's it's only the the public school five billion portions setting it to go on through
2026 and the hospital basically saying this, staying the same with a little bit of
needy language and going to 2026.
Any if there are any other questions we can have a motion No, we're staying the same
That well you there's and this is the public school. Not nothing to do with the SSOs. Yeah, that's that's late around and that's one of the reasons
I want to do this early so that we get one-to-one and everything's not there. We'll say we've already dealt with two of them.
Okay. All right. We'll entertain a motion. We got a motion. Is that a motion? Well, go ahead and state your motion motion.
Do pass. All right. Is there a second?
Second from Senator Estava as any discussion. I guess on this one. All in favor raise your hands.
That looks like unanimous, okay.
So Chairman Hatchet over there, his 504 pass, but just not exactly in the form it was.
However, I had a discussion with him about what I was putting in here, and he was good
with it.
So, you're a little bit late, Miss Adams, I think, but you're bill passed anyway, so even
without you here.
And who, well, let's see, I guess that would be Representative Crow, I think, over all
these things.
Maybe he wants to pick the Senate sponsor on this.
See here?
Okay.
I can do it.
That's fine.
I know we've got different committees going on out there.
All right.
Let me put that out of the way.
So now we'll go to House Bill 86.
Representative Rhodes, are you here?
Should be in the very front of your package.
All right. Go ahead. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Members of the committee, LC number four, three, two, seven, nine, two, S. Committee
substitute. This is really is a simple bill. Two of our great establishments here in
the state. Let's hang on just a minute and make sure I've got the right LC number.
Okay.
2-8-2-0-S, is that what you said?
LC-4-3-27-9-2-S.
Okay.
We might not have given you a 4-3.
We'll get you a copy of it.
I don't think you're going to see too much of this.
4-3-27-9-2-S.
We've got up there one, one second.
So we need to first get him a copy of it.
You need to copy this one.
So we'll let you look at that for a second, the, I'm trying to see what's different.
We do need to have a sunset in the form of amendment that would make it equal our last
I think it was a technical change from leds council where it struck state.
That's correct.
That's really the only difference.
That's correct.
There.
So this one.
online 19 in in my version the LC I just gave you it just struck the word
state and then it was I'm trying to see yeah yeah I'm trying to figure this out
to. This is the current one, this one. Well, we'll go through it from the easiest way and
go through it. It was underlined as a change. So starting at the beginning, you've got
a change on line 13, where you're taking out subparagraphs, B and C, and you're just changing
to provide it in this paragraph. That's correct. Okay. So then that line 22 should have been
struck in your original bill as well. I would think 22 through 27. That's right. Okay.
Then there's a little bit of numbering done in there where we go from, you know,
Since C is gone, we added D and E changes, F changes to E, just technical stuff.
That's the same.
That's right.
Okay, then we go to line 50, and again, provide it in this paragraph, that's the same.
And then we go to B and C are different, we go to June 30, 2027, which we're going to
need to change to be consistent to December 31st, 2026,
or until the aggregate sales.
Other than that, it would be the same.
OK, and go ahead, Senator Alversy,
wants us to stop right there.
Thank you.
Thank you for your turn now.
OK, I just see one thing that looks concerning now
that I'm looking at this version.
If we go to line 16, where it talks about the aggregate state sales tax and use to
refund a pursuant to this paragraph exceeds 4.5 million.
However, if you look two lines down, this applies to both state and local because it's just
sales tax.
So we're saying that there's a cap in the state portion to 4.5 but the locals which
would be the majority of that sales tax would be unlimited.
This is state and local, that's why, in hints on 19, they strike the word state.
So it takes that completely out of play, it means state and local.
Yeah, I know, but if you look up ahead of it, right?
So start on mind 15, it says this is going to apply between July 1st, 2023 until June 20,
30, 20, 27, or into the aggregate state sales tax and use for funding.
So right now, it's inconsistent.
So if it needs to be a total of 4.5 million in the city of Atlanta, you'd have a 4%
to ask you to have a 4.92% local tax, then that would be incongruerant. You'd have to strike
a state on line 16 as well.
Mr. Chairman, I'm just going by what Lage cancels say. I'm no attorney.
all right so um so was the intent to to have a total of 4.5 million or have a total
of 4.5 million kept at 4.5 million for the agreement 800,000 for the
So is that state in local money 4.5 million?
Yes sir.
Okay.
So we'll need to make sure we've got the right language on this, which I guess I think
I agree with Senator Albers that we would strike through state again on line 16.
the exemption is for both. However, the way that the amount not to exceed is, says just
state, I was just conferring a legislative council. It's inconsistent right now.
So if the author is agreeable, I think if we take out line 16 and say 4.5 million state
and local, that's correct. That would correct that era. And then again, we've got to change
the sunset. This will both be at
the land of Fallen County.
Not my bill. You have to ask the
author of the bill. Pretty sure
the zoo and the other zoo in the
aquarium presented this and
that's what they want it. Do we
have anybody here? We do. I don't
see him.
I don't know about from the seat.
So whatever it might be worth, Mr. Chairman, when I passed this in 2017, the good news is
you all know how much I like to measure everything.
This actually came back as an 11-to-1 return on investment positive on the sales tax exemption
versus what they got back in ticketing and all the other things of that nature.
So it did have a very, very good ROI, I will say that much.
Okay, Senator Hickman, you're next. Just clarification. It says certain aquariums and
Zoological institution is there more than one aquarium involved or is it no sir? She's the Atlantic. Just the Atlanta. Okay
But it's open to all the aquariums and Atlanta to apply
Make sure we're not being gratuitous. Yeah, and also zoos if we don't need one would be the zoo in Atlanta. That's correct
Yes, there was a plural on this. They just won. That's correct. Okay
All right, let me let me do Senator Estevez next and I'll get to you thank you, Mr. Chairman
I
am aware that this bill would
Help the zoo help the aquarium
With some of the stuff that they're doing and the city of Atlanta does not have objection to the bill
All right
All right, Senator Beach. I'm number three. Okay
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
At the proper time, I would like to offer an amendment to House Bill 86.
Okay, well we'll need a motion on the original bill before we get to that.
Okay, obviously, but if there's no other questions, I guess we're open.
You got another?
No, I'm just going to have the appropriate time.
Well, go ahead.
You can go ahead.
I'm passing these around.
This is the amendment.
I'd like to make a motion to approve.
All right, we got a motion to approve, is there a second by Senator Albers.
Okay, now Senator Beech is passing around an amendment he would like to offer.
First off, I love his bill, I love what the aquarium's done.
This has nothing to do with his bill.
As you recall, Mr. Chairman, we heard testimony on SB 153 and
that was a 2% ticket sales fee on arenas of 5,000 or more.
And that revenue would go to public safety to buy fire equipment and capital outlay equipment.
And we were told by legislative council that this would have to originate in the house because it was a revenue bill.
And we were talked about attaching it to another bill and this bill looks like the bill we could attach this to.
Again, it would be for capital outlay, for fire trucks and such.
And it's a voluntary tax.
I mean, it's a voluntary, just like the hotel motel tax, the municipalities or the county commissions don't have to do this, but it's a tool in their toolbox to make sure that they are able to buy the proper equipment to go to these arenas if there's a fire or a disaster and have the proper equipment to do the public safety needs that they need to do to address the incident.
So we had a couple of days of testimony on this, Mr. Chairman, if you remember.
We had the fire chief from Atlanta that came and spoke to the need that a fire truck 10 years ago costs 600,000.
Now it's almost a million one to buy some of these fire trucks and they're getting more and more expensive.
And this is good for a range of 5,000 or more is where you could apply this 2% sales tax.
And with that, I'll answer any questions.
So basically what this is, is this is Senate Bill 153 that would be inserted into his bill.
I think after line 88 on the bill I have, I don't know if that's the same LC number.
But my amendment would be to amend, to add this language to House Bill 86 LC 4332792S.
Beginning at the end of his bill at line 88, that's my amendment.
So I'm looking for the the 5,000 here, but it's on page.
Okay, I see it now. Okay. So so you're wanting to to have a 2%
sales tax increase on all the stadiums in Georgia. If 2000 more people and
for for how long did you want to do this and and well and then I'm sure it
specifies in here where the money's going to you're saying fire trucks it's
going to capital outlay I think that's on let me see I can
All right.
Flying 76.
I think.
Capital outlay projects.
Maintenance and operations.
Right 76.
Capital outlay projects.
The construction of public safety
facilities, including acquiring.
Improving.
Equipping.
of the retirement debt issued to respect the Cal State project.
And again, this is voluntary by the county or cities if they want to enact this, but if
they do, this revenue would go to public safety.
Capital projects.
All right, I don't know if I think he's checking with leds counsel making sure it was all.
Okay.
Any questions on this that would have a 2% sales tax increase on all stadiums in Georgia
35,000 or more. The Senator Beech would be the one to ask the questions, too.
Okay. Senator Hickman wants to make a motion.
Please.
Two steps. Senator Beech is a member of the Sunside.
All right. And you don't have a sunset on either, do you? No, I do not.
Well, we've got a motion a second on the table.
Any discussions, any amendments, anyone needs to offer that would be at this time.
All right, I see nothing, so I see the other questions, so this will be up and down
vote I guess all those in favor of Senator Beech's amendment raise your hand all right opposed all right motion carries
thank you eight to three I believe I saw four no votes eight to four okay
Okay. So now we've accepted the amendment onto the original bill. So now we're ready
to vote on the bill as a whole. All those in favor of the bill.
Oh, okay, sure. That's right. We've got to amend it some more.
Well you've got the bill you you've got you don't have the bill in front of you
Now what we're saying is he offered an amendment
He's got an amendment I passed out an amendment right here, but she's talking about the
else in them. Give the current else that you're working off over right now, Representative
Rhodes. The latest version.
the amendment the one I presented that we changed was 4 3 2 7 9 2 s but that's
but when you got here we said we had 43 2 8 2 0 as somebody should have
came right 43 2 8 2 0 yes that's a copy you have that's the latest version with
some technical changes and now the amendment is on there and we've got to
change the sunset and take that state and strike it out. So I think you're
ready to offer amendments on that, aren't you? First, Mr. Chairman, I'd like
on line 16 to change 2027 to 2026 and then do the same thing on line 59 to
strike 2027 and make it 2026 as a first amendment.
So we can we can vote on that or we can we're still going back and forth on the state sales
tax part so to give us a minute what we put on that one okay so we've got an amendment
to change the sunset to December 31st 2026 and and we've got a second any other discussion
I had a question for the sponsor of the bill I didn't know whether 2027 was
of any significance to the aquarium or to the zoo it was it's just like we've
done the previous few times they did this bill it was just a four-year period
and I guess they were just running it on our physical calendar and since we're
given parity to the bills that's why we're using the December 30
first 2026 date.
I'm just cheering. I think if we just strike state on line 16, that actually does it. So it's
a congruent with the rest of it. So it just says aggregate sales taxes.
Okay. Yes. I can't remember. I don't think we voted on the other amendment on the sunset.
Did we? So first of all, let's vote on the sunset amendment.
December 31st, 2026, all in favor, raise your hand.
Okay, looks unanimous, I think.
So now you can offer another amendment.
Align 16, strike the word state between aggregate and sales.
Okay, you need a second to that.
All right, second from Senator Arkel's,
any discussion, all in favor of that, raise your hand.
Looks unanimous again, okay.
So now we're back to the original bill with Senator Beaches' amendment, with the Sunset
Amendment and Strocking State amendment now in the bill.
All those in favor of the bill as a whole?
Raise your hand.
Okay.
Opposed?
All right.
We've got two opposed motion carries.
And we just a second to catch up with my paper work here.
And Chair, Chairman, you're carrying, correct?
Yes, sir.
All right, we're going to move down, like, is representative Crow here.
Okay. Well, I guess we can try to do this without him. House Bill 101, Representative
Crowe. The a couple of sections had been taken out of that. So right now we have just got
the SSI win there or if the committee thinks we need to wait on the House member.
I'm going to either way on that.
Mr. Chairman, he had come to Senate Bill to present, and so he makes it up beyond the board
and Senate Bill as well.
Okay.
All right. Well, we can, let's see, we've got a couple of more besides this.
So we can go on to your bill if you want to, Mr. Chairman, but I don't think I've got
a fiscal note yet on it, so we may have to wait on a vote on it.
Do you want to go through it or?
So this will be House Bill 454, if my members are right, let me look and see.
Yes, House Bill 454 from Chairman Black,
and if you all want to move to that.
I guess since we're waiting on the fiscal note, Mr. Chairman,
I'll try to hit the highlights and be happy to jump
into the weeds if anybody has any questions.
But there are three parts.
And in section one, it would allow our manufacturers
to take certain expenditures in year one as they have been,
instead of over a five year period,
which was a change from the Feds.
And this year's IRC update sections two through five
are several technical changes and also some code
that would try to help offset some of those changes
that were made in 1437 from last year,
including a credit for itemizers.
But it also is designed to kind of saddle up
with what the feds do and closely align with how the feds
process income tax, according to itemizers
and standard deductors.
And then in the last section, it contains a piece
which on the forced measure definition
that would include pandemic as a part
of the natural disaster that would
qualify them for an extension on receiving credits.
So the issue with section six is that
pandemics weren't included.
I think there's an issue of somebody may not,
may have some legitimate reasons,
but there's also the question of how to do it
and not go back retrospective and be gratuitous in it.
us in it. So that's still kind of being looked at a little bit, I think, to my understanding.
So we'll save that for the next time. Did you go, let me just go through it section
by section. A lot of people, you know, haven't been familiar with this as you are. So I want
give them all time to see this. So the the accelerated appreciation is I didn't
that's in this one right it is section one yes so that is I guess what you
would call decoupling from the federal code which would let us treat it as we
had been treating it. And it's the only thing that when Senator Hickman did the IRS update
was not included in that bill. It was being looked at when we update the code. So that's
one section of this is changing our depreciation to where it had been. It's, I guess in my
mind, if you look at that, it changes the years you can take it in so you could have a
a dip in revenue and then an increase later on
because where they depreciate out over five years
are able to depreciate it in one year.
It's kind of still the same amount of money we're getting.
Does that make sense to everybody?
It's a little dip in year one
and I think it kind of bounces out
and actually pushes back up over time, yes.
And then the next part of the bill deals with trying
trying to eliminate the marriage penalty where we would go to 12 and 24 on standard deductions.
Why don't you talk personal exemptions and standard deductions in the committee?
Well, there's some words to it.
Where we were and where we are.
Yes, sir.
With the personal exemption, you actually impact not only itemizers, you know, obviously
not only non-automizers, but itemizers.
And so when we did a look back and adjusted that back over to the standard deduction, there
was some increase in revenue over time, having our accountants and groups, different groups
look at that.
And so we adjusted from the standard deduction all the way up instead of phasing it in
over time on page seven.
Those are struck and you jump straight to the 24, so you're allowing families to go
ahead and realize those extra dollars earlier sooner rather than later if you will.
That section's three and four.
And then it's a three year look back on the triggers instead of a five year look back
to you.
I don't think you talked about that.
There was some question, yes, or as to whether or not with the years, the way they were
structured as if that would skip a 10th of a percent and so I know that was a
Senate provision I would certainly yield the y'all's judgment but yes or
it adjusted from five to three and one of the reasons you know I'm conscious
and like see often numbers is we had a previous and this really isn't a tax cut
and rate but we had a previous tax cut and a rate and I was trying to make
sure that nobody got a tax increase in the bill. We thought we had everybody
covered and then the last go around we looked all the numbers and there was a
small group because of a little exemption that went away of blind and disabled
that got a tax increase and so we had to go back and fix that otherwise the
headlines would have been we raised taxes on the blind and disabled which
wasn't the intent but we're still trying to make sure we have all the numbers
in place to go with this so that we can show everybody exactly how it impacts. It's really
not a change again in tax rate, but it is accelerating the plan on going to 12 and 24,000 on
standard deductions individual and couple because that would then eliminate, well, take
a wet blanket. That would eliminate what's called the marriage penalty where people may
actually play more into axes. And it couples with the, you know, the feds and the way
they're handled, they're standard deductions. And in lieu of a personal exemption,
itemizers would either get to choose between the standard or their
itemization, which they drag down from the federal level, and of course they
get for 3,000 on the dependent side, and then the credit would offset what they've
been getting in the personal exemption as of right now that's right and you
may have been saying this but they could now choose whether they want to go
standard or itemize. Senator Hicken, I never call on you. You had your line on
forever. No, so I think you've answered most of the question but I think I go back
and blow jaw because this happened a lot of this happened at the end of last
session when we were when we had a lot of pressure on us to do away with the
whole state of economics in Georgia and the all came back with this compromise which I'm
very, very much pleased with. And you cleared up a lot of my question by your answers.
Thank you. Okay. All right. Well, we can't vote on today. So if there's not any other
questions, we'll have you back on Wednesday. And I hear there's a fiscal note that maybe
is waiting on one second here, but I hadn't seen it yet. Maybe you'll have it today.
I don't know. I thank you Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. All right now they've been
stay in there. Maybe from last time, they've been there a while, Mr. Jen.
All right, we're going to go on to 101 now if the rep is here.
Mr. Chair, you're your rep hat and come in. I don't guess yet, Hazy.
All right, we'll do 170 then. I think those are the two we have left for the day.
Thank you, Chair. Thank you, committee. Let's make sure we're all on the, I think I got this
this from the back LC 432795S.
Is that what you guys have?
Let me pull that out.
170.
Okay.
Yeah, so most of this deal is,
I believe we're still just two subjects on this aren't we
the digital downloads and the length of distance somebody could sell their goods.
That is correct.
So it's basically two items that deal with digitally collected sales tax.
So I'm going to go over the digital download piece first.
I think this is something most people have heard.
And then we'll touch base on the alcohol piece after that.
So the digital download piece is basically trying to put parity between mom and pop
pop and retailers in your community and retailers that sell online.
So this would apply to books, there's a big list over here, but it basically would apply
to books, albums, artwork, newspapers, magazines, video games that you buy for permanent use.
So it's not a streaming service, it's not something that you're renting, it's literally,
instead of going to GameStop and buying Call of Duty, you're buying it online.
And so it's a parody and taxation I think that's been long overdue and it's just updating
our tax code.
There's language in here that exempts and make sure it's clear that it's not streaming.
It's also not business to business stuff that's currently not taxable as my understanding.
There has been some language chairman has changed some language around but I feel pretty
confident.
The purpose of the language change was to make sure that we were capturing the taxes
that we are wanting to tax on permanent use items and not streaming top materials.
Is that correct, Chairman?
Right, right.
The way there's going to be a fiscal note here, my personal opinion is it's higher than
what we're going to capture, but also there was a couple of legal opinions that we weren't
really going to tax anything with some of the other wording.
Yep, and so then he added the language there with me if I can find a sheet that's on
my power desk.
Sorry, oh, there we go.
So that section 2, 3 basically is what it basically discusses that stuff that was
changed but yeah and I agree with you I don't think the fiscal node will be
quite as high as that as well but it is just to me it's important to make
sure that we have a parity in our tax at taxation system so that we are
taxing brick and mortars the same as we're doing online and then if that's
and this is this is basically what you're trying to get to is if they're an
end user of the project that's correct and possess it that's the only thing
That's right. So it's not a book. It's not a it's not an app that you might have to get a bunch of books in a month
It's literally you go to Barnes and Noble you buy the book or you buy the book permanently on your phone your tax
At the same rate and so that's that's the point of the tax
All right, Senator Albers
Thank you, miss chairman
This actually I believe a representative carpenter similar to have what we do with marketplace facilitator to make sure that we didn't give
Somebody online a benefit versus mainstream that that's exactly right
I mean it's so a lot of people say well this is the tax increase and I'll say it is in a way
But in the because there's more revenue, but I think it's actually making our tax code congruent across all man
Ways people purchase items
So it's updating that thank you
All right
Any questions on this section from the committee
All right, don't see any okay go to the other part of your bill if you would all right
Yep, thank you, sir.
In 2020, the legislature passed House Bill 879, allowing home delivery of alcohol.
It was a great step to allow consumers to match alcohol regulation in the state of Georgia.
Like most laws we pass in this building, I think it's important to evaluate after a few
years and make sure that the intention of the legislation is working in the real world.
I'm pushing this legislation because it does not work for all of Georgia.
When you live in a city with one grocery store or liquor store, this law only works for
you if you live in that city and not in that county.
Even worse, if you live two miles from a store, but it happens to be in the next county,
our laws do not allow these deliveries to occur.
Nothing in this bill will change where the taxes paid or how returns are currently handled
with alcohol delivery and it does not create some sort of alcohol fulfillment centers.
It just allows Georgians to buy products they desire from the stores that they normally
shop and puts us in parity with Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Louisiana.
So what it would do currently is alcohol delivery that we pass in 2020 allows you to deliver
in the jurisdiction.
So if I live in the city of Dalton, I can only have by alcohol delivered to my house from
stores in the city of Dalton.
I can't buy them from the county to come into the city.
I can't live in the county and buy from the city,
or I can't live next door on the county line
in Murray County and get stuff delivered from Dalton
or Whitfield County.
And so what I'm saying is consumers don't always purchase
within their county.
They have stores that they like to purchase,
and I think a 25 mile radius is a reasonable distance
for people to be able to purchase these items
to be delivered to their home.
My county's 33 miles long, so I don't,
I think if you did just county, just jurisdictions
within that county, it wouldn't, I mean,
that's even bigger than what I'm asking here.
I think that it's shopping patterns
and what people desire to be dropped off
at their front door.
And I'll be glad to take any questions.
All right, Senator Albers had one.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you again, Representative Carpenter.
I live in an area that I think this is most applicable to,
where I live in Roswell within a mile or so
is Alpharetta, is Milton, and Cobb County.
And some places cannot deliver across the street,
but they can go 30 miles in different directions
because of where those lines come together.
And it makes absolutely no sense to arbitrary pick it up
by that line.
I realize in some areas of state,
there might be large, unincorporated counties
in other areas where some of us live.
There's a lot of municipalities.
But this just makes perfect sense.
So somebody can actually service the people
that are cross the street for them
as opposed to missing all that opportunity.
So thank you for bringing it forward.
Yeah, and I mean, I'll agree with you.
So Whitfield County didn't even have a liquor store
until about a year ago.
So, I mean, you couldn't even,
they couldn't even buy from anywhere
from a liquor store until about a year ago.
And we don't have anybody operating in this space
because I don't think that the,
you know, when you get out of the metro,
the radius is important to be able to,
allow people to be profitable in the space, so.
And one more question that I could.
Isn't it true?
We'd much rather someone gets something to deliver to their house, then to potentially
get in their car and drive under the influence.
Absolutely.
Thank you.
All right, Senator Hickman.
I believe you were next.
Thank you.
Governor.
I think I picked up somewhere.
This particular bill was heard like three times in a house and three different committees
and it failed in all three committees and it's over.
Yeah, this bill hadn't failed in any committee.
It's been, there's been a Senate bill, a house bill, and they've never had hearing.
in a couple of committees and then it was put on another bill in another committee, but never received a vote.
Unfortunately, because I think we had the votes.
How, okay, second question. How does this one protect minors from receiving out?
The same way the current law does.
Nothing, we're not changing the current law.
We're just opening it up to be able to go to 25 mile radius.
So currently you have to have an ID on site when you deliver, et cetera.
So nothing, that's current law right now.
This bill doesn't address that issue.
So we can't do it like a jail fence and think around counties to figure out where the county line is is supposed to 25 mile
Yeah, I don't what I don't think it solves the real problem is what center Albers said
You know the important that if you live on the county line here and you shop at that store right there
But you can't have it delivered but you got to order it from 30 miles the other way
I mean just it doesn't it doesn't make make a lot of sense to me
Okay, and and nothing's changing about where the tax is being paid
If I go to the liquor store here and buy a bottle of bourbon and drive home and drink it, I'm paying taxes here
I'm not paying it where I'm drinking it and so this would be the same thing and that's what's occurring right now with the delivery piece
All right, we got it. Thank you. Keep going on this center as the best. I think you were next. I just had a question
I I wasn't here in 2020. What was the reasoning?
COVID? Oh, what was the reason for just the
That was the reason behind the local jurisdiction.
Yeah, I didn't carry the legislation.
The gentleman's here today that did,
but I think a lot of it was negotiations, right?
It was a tough, it was a big step from where we had been.
And when we negotiate legislation,
sometimes we have to do what we can get through
to get passed.
And so that's my belief.
And there was some concern about the taxation piece,
but I think we've proven that the taxation should occur
wherever the products picked up.
All right, one more question.
We're gonna hear from some others, Senator Beech.
I want to say that, oh sorry, the 25 mile radius bothers me, I have a problem with that.
And I also like Senator Hickman.
I heard it's failed three times in the house, now maybe you just clarified that.
But this bill should, this part of the bill, part one section one, one should be a regulated
industry bill not in finance.
And so I cannot vote for this bill with this Part 1 section 1, 1 in it.
I think 25 miles is just too long.
I mean, some people would call that boot lagging, and that's a long way.
All right, we've got a couple people that want to speak on this.
So, um, I'm pretty much saying bye-bye.
Brett Herald, former Chair of Ways and Means, I think is here.
And-
I don't know if I can see it if they're together.
I'm-
I'm going to go too far.
I'm going to go too far.
I'm going to go too far.
He loved the day Jim and battle loads.
I do love that part of the sound tax policy.
Well, I'll do his babies to get it.
All right, and try to be concise.
We are.
Yeah, we will.
Casey Honeyman with the Wine and Spirits Hall Sailor's
the Georgia thank you all for here in a cell.
I have with me, Brett Harrell, who helps us out with Robins
government relations.
Thank you for here in us.
I think a couple of points here.
I think number one, this isn't a normal consumer package.
normal consumer package good, this is beverage alcohol.
It's the product of not one but two amendments to the U.S. Constitution.
We have to keep that in mind when we're setting the table here.
When we stood up this law two years ago, we were very proud to support it.
This is something that we took and it was a big step forward.
People are getting their groceries delivered.
We wanted to be able to have beer and wine and spirits in this case to be in that mix.
And I think Chairman's a good friend, but I think there were a couple of pieces that
We wanted to kind of make sure we're clear on the record here.
As it relates to the taxation piece,
when our wholesalers make deliveries to a beverage alcohol
retailer, the excise tax is remitted at that point.
The beverage alcohol retail delivery law stipulates
that because alcohol is regulated,
it's treated differently than tomatoes and toothpaste
that when that goes out the door for delivery,
that sale is not consummated on a sales tax perspective
until that delivery is made.
So if you broaden out 25 miles,
we're now tax-based shifting a lot of money on a local level.
If a city of Atlanta retailer is making a delivery,
the excise tax mark trucks,
it's remitted to that local city of Atlanta
and to the state.
And then also when that delivery is made,
and now it's a consumer in Sandy Springs
and done what he dropped 25 mile map around the city of Atlanta,
he touched a lot of places.
Those are cities and counties that are not realizing
that those tax dollars anymore.
Again, we have the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee
that was there that was focal or a key part
of making this bill a reality.
And I think when we did it two plus years ago,
we all sat together and we all raised our hands and said,
this is something that needed to change.
This is something that was carefully done,
that was thoughtfully done.
It's something that we were happy to support in the end,
but maybe Chairman Harrell, if there's enough time,
can kind of talk about how that process came to us.
So as mentioned, I actually was the author
the original facilitator bill and the author of the original home delivery of alcohol bill.
So I have some knowledge of both and let me stop you there and say that we passed down
the fourth day of that session, the first three days, because I was a Senate sponsor,
the first three days he was out with a flu and wasn't helping me at all.
Well, I came on strong at the end and we got it done.
Pretty much.
Let me make the, as was mentioned earlier, the purpose of facilitator was to get Georgia
brick and mortar stores on parity with large out-of-state sellers. This amendment does just
the opposite with regard to jurisdictions. You will have a large retailer buying alcohol
in significant quantity that now can ship outside of their licensed jurisdiction and compete
with smaller retailers and other jurisdictions. It is just the opposite of what we intended
with marketplace facilitator.
Secondly, it was stated nothing changes,
nothing in this bill changes the tax sales tax law.
That's true.
But the sales tax in the law today and in facilitator
is paid at the point of delivery.
So when deliveries are made outside of a taxing jurisdiction
into a taxing jurisdiction with a different tax rate,
that will cause problems with collections and remittance.
One jurisdiction will probably benefit.
the other jurisdiction may not.
So there are legitimate tax issues caused
by a 25 mile radius because nothing else
in the underlying bill was modified.
So that is a serious and legitimate problem there.
Also an enforcement, let's say a delivery is made
outside the licensed jurisdiction.
Under the current home delivery law,
that alcohol license hanging on the wall in a retailer
is ultimately what guarantees compliance.
If you make a delivery outside that licensed jurisdiction,
let's say an underage delivery.
And a police officer catches that person
made an underage delivery.
So what are they going to issue a citation
to the delivery person, maybe the delivery company?
But how do they jump from that jurisdiction back
to a license that they have an issue?
I mean, is that police officer going
to call the neighboring jurisdiction
and say, please enforce against this retailer
that has an alcohol license on the floor.
It is a serious enforcement issue as well.
And these are things that just simply are not contemplated
in this simple amendment that strikes the word licensing
jurisdiction in replaces it with $25.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
We got to get some questions here, Senator Alpers.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Great to see you again.
I don't know if I should feel like a chairman representative
or the smart guy.
Just the smart guys making more money in the room.
Thank you for all the work you did when you were here.
I think, in case you were up a great point about groceries,
that same grocery store can deliver to everyone around them
for everything else in that grocery store today.
They have thousands of thousands items,
and they can go to everywhere around them,
no issues, no concerns at all.
And if a delivery company did something foolishly
like not ask for an ID, the delivery company
would be the people that are in trouble.
they would be the ones who would get cited,
they would be the ones who would get in trouble,
not necessarily the owner of the liquor store
because at the point of left them,
it was the delivery company's part.
So I appreciate the fact that you're very passionate
about your industry.
You wanted to protect what is currently in place,
but this is kind of silly, guys.
I mean, it's time to move forward on some of this.
All right, let me get Senator Tiller here, your comments.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, thank you.
Chairman of ICE for being with us today.
I just have a question for you.
I think we'd be remiss if we didn't take you up on your expertise in cases as well.
What do you think an appropriate radius would be if 25 is not it?
Well, I think the concept of radius is not the appropriate way.
I mean, again, I don't think a radius is going to call, when it crosses jurisdiction
and boundaries is going to cause these problems,
whether it's five miles or up to 500 miles,
absent if you really want to achieve that.
They're just simply multiple other portions of state law
that would have to be addressed that are not addressed here.
So radius was always going to be problematic.
And Mr. Chairman, if I might, the original law
spoke to the idea of same day local proximate delivery.
And that was really important.
and the one way we achieved that was making sure
tax dollars stayed in the communities
in which these retailers were servicing every day.
It was not next day shipping, that's different.
That's when we start to separate out.
And the radius, as you continue to grow,
that's where we start to move into.
And I think the idea of looking at these third-party actors
in the state of Georgia, they are not licensed in the state.
And they are eight, they're agents of the retailer.
So they don't have any skin in the game.
Excuse me, Mr. Chair.
Senator Ann Vittart, I think Mr. Chairman,
I'm going to be brief, not to beat a dead horse,
but I love you guys, but I mean,
this is such common sense stuff.
Consumer driven, as someone who hates taxes,
whether I drive to the store to pick it up
or they're going to bring it to my house,
I'm going to get taxed, whether you
in here at the cost or not, I'm still going to get taxed.
I mean, if I can right now buy a wine online,
which I know all these products can be different,
and I can literally get it to the Walgreens
and pick it up,
because that's where the FedEx box is gonna be,
or they're gonna bring it to my house,
or whatever, I'm still gonna pay.
Like, let's just change the system and move on
to consumers after what we've lived through,
after, you know, during the pandemic
to the way everything towards, you know,
Senator Albers mentioned,
even to buying a sofa wanted to put it in my house,
Like, let's stop over-regulating everything
and get to just common sense policy.
I love both of you, but I mean, this is simple.
All right, there's people that,
and I'll call the question Mr. Chairman when you're ready.
But I need to let a couple more people talk,
if y'all could step down.
Thank you for the opportunity.
Now, Dante Handel was here from ACCG.
Are you on this particular issue?
Okay, so that was taken care of, I think.
Department of Revenue is here. I guess I want to ask you all quickly before I let the last guy speak here
What's your we've heard some stuff that they might be some confusion here? Do you mind testifying to that? I don't like putting you on the spot, but
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, Austin Gibbons, from the Department
of Revenue.
I'm joined by Ironetta Duncan, our alcohol chief attorney at this is her first time before
a senate finance hearing, but she's our expert on this issue.
We've worked really hard with the House and the Senate on the underlying bill and I yield
Tyronella for any questions on the title three changes.
So the question is it sounds like it might be hard to regulate or keep up with or something
like that is what's your opinion on that?
At this time we don't find that it would be difficult for us.
We do feel that we can implement this bill administratively, even if we have to do it
through rules and regs.
All right. Well, that's probably all I need from you today. I appreciate you.
The last one that had signed up and you're going to have to be pretty quick is Mark Smith.
Okay. Two points. I would offer that the legislation we passed last year with
food trucks showed where a food truck was permitted in one county but can operate
around the whole state from a dealing with a permit process, same with a license.
So an alcohol license in one county, if there was an issue delivered to the other county,
we are already addressing that issue in other places.
And then also just a ACCG and GMA, we had conversations on this piece of the legislation, they
were neutral.
Okay.
Thank you, motion, Mr. Chair.
Now, your button's about amendment something, or we'll do that after the motion.
then. So go ahead, Senator Albers.
Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I moved you past House Bill 170, LC 43, 27, 95 S.
Okay. We got a motion and a dual seconds. I think it was Senator Arik that won that.
So any other discussion on that? Now you want to offer an amendment.
Yeah. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Carpenter, I love the part two about your bill getting
digital up with bricks and mortar and making a level playing field. But when you're dealing
with alcohol, I just think it's different. In my amendment to HB 170 LC 432795S would
be strike part one section one dash one lines 10 through 43 regarding the 25 mile radius
language that's being requested. That's my amendment. We've got an amendment that says
just struck this section altogether. Is there a second of that? Okay, we've got a second
to that, so we'll vote on the amendment first. All those in favor of striking this section
completely raise your hands. Okay, we've got four. Okay, all those opposed. Okay, I think
you voted twice. Okay, so this is to oppose to the amendment. Let's start over. All those
that are in agreement with the amendment that we struck this section out completely raise
your hand. Okay, that's going to be three. Now, all those opposed to the amendment raise
your hand. One, two, three, six. Okay, six to three. So the amendment fails. Now, we're
on the main motion. All those in favor of this bill. As it is, raise your hand. One, two,
three, four, five, six. Okay, opposed. Oh, actually, okay, three opposed. Okay. So six
and three again, I believe.
All right, your motion carries.
Thank you.
Appreciate you guys.
All right, we've got one more bill
if the committee wants to tackle it.
If you think we have time.
I got to go to another committee.
Is everybody OK to stay for one more bill?
All right, come on up.
OK, I don't think any of this shit is hurtful.
You know, I got to get to that meeting on subcommittee on the
Christmas.
No, but well, thank you.
That's okay.
That's tillers.
All right.
Your bill now just has the, we did the other part earlier and passed out the hospital and the public school with a
the 2026 Sunset, like we're doing everything else, December 31st.
So your bill currently just has the SSO on there,
and I need to flip pages and get rid of all this paperwork and get to it.
I'll say if I can get a copy of that, Mr. Chairman.
Yeah, make sure he's got a copy of the,
I think it's pretty much the same language you had going to 130.
There may be a sunset on it as well, but
Okay, if not, I would want one more on there.
So that's LC432795S, is that correct?
Okay, so we've got a 4.3, 2838S,
y'all gave him that copy.
Yeah.
So the only thing different in this in yours
is the sunset on there that we have consistently put
on everything, other than that.
I mean, look it over and be sure,
but other than that, I believe that's the only change.
Yes, that looks like it.
So all the other parts you said would be.
I'm just second somebody's still trying to find the bill here, so this is the substitute
of House Bill 101, LC432828S, all right, y'all keep the talking down please, all right,
go ahead and present, y'all keep the talking down over here, come on, okay, well as you
stated Mr. Chairman, this is the portion of the bill that's left from our original House
bill 101 would deal with the school scholarship organizations. And it looks like that it would raise the aggregate amount for 2024 in all subsequent years to 130 million per year.
And there is a sunset added for December 31st, 2026. And you said that the rural hospitals.
We put that on, on Matt Hatchett, Chairman Hatchett's bill and you're welcome to pick the
care for that Senate sponsor if you want to.
The only change there was we didn't go to the 80 million, we left it at 75, we left
the language and they needed, and we also sunset those 20, 20, 60's in particular first.
All right.
So those passed out earlier.
And what was the other one you said you moved on to that is rural hospitals and-
And the public 5 million.
Okay, and the habitat is still got some work to do on that yeah, all right?
All right, so we've got we've got this villain front of us. Everybody familiar with what we've got here?
Any questions on it?
Looks like I see some people had some amendments put first.
We've got we'll have to have the main motion on the floor to do that. So we've got a motion by
Senator Hickman to approve is there a second got a second
Senator Albers to approve all right Senator Chiller your life is lit up there
so thank you miss president I'd like to propose a amendment and it's handed
out it's a amendment 49-0-100 I think everybody has it let me tell you what
Let me, let me find it here.
Months, 49, zero, 100.
I think it would have came to you a little quicker.
I'm still looking for my coffee, but.
Okay, I found it here.
There's one right here.
Okay, Mr. Chairman, the purpose of this amendment is we've continued to raise the
Scholarship this goals. I think most people call it a goal scholarship year after year and I have
Have issues with that overall all support school choice and support at this point in time a complete ESA voucher
I do have concerns about the fact that we have broker fees that are associated with this scholarship that
That continue to allow it to be eroded from its total amount for paying of the broker
So what a amendment I guess this will be a amendment one does is it caps that broker fee currently right now that broker fee for the first
1.5 million is kept at 8%
That's about 120 thousand dollars and then later on after that first 1.5 million it looks like it goes up to
goes down to
A 6%, which raises about another $7.2 million.
What the amendment does is caps the broker fee at 2.5%
for the first $120 million.
And then after $120 million caps it at 2%.
That would still leave an excess of $3 million in broker
fees for this $120 million scholarship.
It would force more of the scholarship to be used
for its purpose, and if the committee thinks as well, I think it makes it a better bill.
Second.
Second.
All right.
We've got a motion and a second on that amendment.
I guess we may look like I've got a couple more people handing me some able to go through
all these and then look at them.
question I had two on this I guess the I don't know how you refer to them but
the corporate donations go to kind of like the poor schools and I know
you've got a list of all those schools in the in the package and that is limited
to five million dollars is there a reason that parts only at five million
dollars. Okay. All right. Just a question I had. All right. So we've got an amendment on the floor
and now Senator Estevez, you must have one of these here, huh? I do. I have a couple actually.
I've broke them down in small bites for the committee and would refer folks and
and Representative Crowd, thank you so much for bringing this bill.
The first amendment is AM430235, amendment two, and this would be an amendment that would require annually for the student scholarship organization to submit a report to the Department of Audits.
that would be very similar to the voucher bill
that was passed out of the Senate, sorry,
earlier this session, but would require a report
that has performance data from the scholarship recipients
on a nationally norm reference test,
level of satisfaction of those parents
and the participating students,
and then the average medium amount of scholarship received
by the scholarship recipients,
as well as the average and median total cost
of attendance of the schools that those students are going to.
This information would be aggregated,
so as to protect the student's identity,
but would provide the public some transparency
as far as what's happening with the money
that is going to these students who
are attending these various schools.
So just a transparency measure that would help us better understand where this money is going and how it's being used.
So that would be a minimum number two.
So looking to remember, is this language that was in Senator Dola's office bill or is this different?
Yeah, I believe it's very similar to his bill.
I can't say it's all of it is word-for-word, but the reports, I will say the reports are
or the information that's being requested in these reports
are pretty straightforward and something that certainly
I know public schools report on pretty normally.
So I'd imagine it would not be too difficult
for these student scholarship organizations
to do the same.
All right, we've got a motion.
Is there an amendment offered?
Is there a second to that?
All right.
line's 37 through 40 that protects the identity of the individual students in that
right right because it's aggregate it says there yeah okay and let me see who
always sign up on this though I guess there might be more about this trim I had
two more amendments two more okay go ahead five zero zero zero four one much
much quicker this time around. This would be a amendment that would require students,
student scholarship organizations have a yearly audit that is provided to the Department
of Revenue. This would make those audits open to, or the require the organization to
make those available to the public within a reasonable time of such requests. It's very
We're similar to the interest that we showed earlier today in ensuring that those veteran
programs were transparent with the grant money that they were receiving.
And then the second provision would ensure that no member of General Assembly or spouse
would receive income from student scholarship organizations during the taxable year that
they're receiving these contributions with the tax credit.
So to ensure that all of us don't have a conflict with these programs that are receiving
over $120 million in tax, pay or money.
All right, so two bars to that amendment.
Okay, Senator Hickman.
Can you clear if a legislative receive an income, what you mean by that?
No member of the General Assembly or their spouse can receive income from the student
scholarship organization. Does that mean that no legislators can be one of those people
that sells those scholarships receive commissions off of it? So what's your name?
Correct. The administrative fee. Okay. Thank you. Senator
Sillier was talking about. Okay, so we've got amendment number three offered. Is
there a second to that? Second from Senator Oroch. You said you had one more. And
And then the last amendment, Mr. Chairman, I believe addresses your concern.
It would restrict the additional $10 million that is being requested to those student scholarship
organizations that give 100% of their scholarships and tuition grants to students who reside in
school zones with the lowest 25% of all public schools.
If you recall the Senate passed that amendment with the voucher bill that passed a chamber
just a couple weeks ago, so this would make that consistent with the SSO program only for
the additional $10 million that is being requested.
So were you saying the $5 million and $10 million total of $15 million or just $10 million?
This would be separate from the 5 million.
Okay, so they would get 15 million of the 130 million, is that what you're saying?
That would be, that would be my desire for the, for, that's, that's what your amendment
is offering.
The increase in, the increase in funds would, would only go to those student scholarship
organizations that are giving 100% of their grants to students who reside in those attendance
zones.
All right.
And that's your last amendment, all right?
Yes, sir.
Let me let some people speak real quick. One of them has already been taken care of because
their stuff got moved to another bill. Let's hear from Kellen Carr. I guess you
represent these and you can you can still say that stay there unless we get two
people here. You represent the I guess the corporate schools and I think
there's a list in here. Maybe several pages long while the schools that you
would you would represent is it going to? Yeah, this triple A scholarship foundation. So
that would be your school. So tell us quickly. Let me ask you first about, there's a lot
of, I guess, transparency that's been put on here. What's your opinion of that?
Yeah. Well, first of all, thank you, Chairman Hustetler, for allowing me to speak today
and the committee.
Thank you for, you know, representative Crow,
you know, definitely think that an increase to the cap
is needed.
The demand was hit day one.
Many donors were subject to a 78% pro-ration.
Students remain on the wait list throughout the state.
We have 130 students right now on our wait list.
For AAA Scholarship Foundation,
we serve eligible low-income children
through the QE tax credit program.
So our student is an ethnic minority living
with a struggling single parent caregiver
and many times a high crime community.
More than 80% of the children that we award
are living and households with annual incomes
at or below 200% of the federal poverty level.
So for the average household income of the families
we serve, it's about $37,000 a year.
And by the time our students receive this scholarship,
they're either below grade level,
They're failing at their previous school
or both when they received the scholarship.
So the spirit of the income-based scholarship
is that it really provides an educational alternative
to a group of people who, because of the financial
circumstances alone, would otherwise have none.
The cap was met day one this year.
It was a 78%, you know, pro-ration.
We have a lot of students still on our wait list.
And for us, it means that we can't get the siblings
off of our wait list.
And for financially struggling families,
that means the difficulty of splitting
their children between multiple schools
or forfeiting their scholarship
so that both children can attend the same public school.
We also rely exclusively on corporate donations
to fund our scholarships.
As the families we serve typically
don't have much tax liability to speak of.
I think Chairman Hustler,
when you asked the question earlier
on the low income students,
we do rely on corporate donations.
We commend the Senate last year
for allowing insurance companies
to participate in the program,
like C-CorpS have always been able to participate.
Right now in statute, there's a limit on insurance companies
that is set at six million.
We would respectfully ask the committee
to consider striking that, setting it at 5%,
so that if the cap is raised,
it just gives insurance companies more room to participate
because that does serve our low-income students.
As far as some of the other things, I was trying to take notes pretty furiously on some
of the other amendments were certainly open to more transparency.
Some of this past last year on interest earned having to go to scholarships, but look forward
to continuing the dialogue on all of this, but certainly happy to answer any questions.
It's back to your, when I talked about the aggregate data of the transparency fiscal
audits, is that something you're comfortable with, you've got any issues with that or?
Yes.
So some of the transparency past last year and 517 that was interest earned would have
to go back into scholarships.
We thought that was really good.
And I think there was maybe 17 measures that were passed.
We certainly have some ideas on additional transparency.
One thing that my SSO brought forward is if the school requires an annualized standardized
test that that be reported to the parent or guardian so that these families can track whether
this is working for the student or not.
Most schools provide a standardized test being sure that the parents have access to that
so that they can see if that child is meeting grade level metrics.
We think that would be a good pathway.
We've got two more people I think want to speak.
Is there something important you're going to need to ask on this?
So we appreciate your testimony.
I've got Justin Polly.
Jim, committee members. Just thank you for the opportunity to speak here. I'll be very
brief. I'm Justin Polly with the Georgia School Boards Association. We currently represent
every school board in the state. Our association, our membership, has a long standing position
opposing tuition tax credits, and at this point we just can't support what this bill is trying to do.
We do appreciate the amendments offered, and we thank you very much.
All right.
Thanks. We've got Dr. Steven Owens out here.
I believe this is the last one that hasn't spoken, and again, try to be, I hate to catch on time, but we're running out.
No, that's no problem.
Chairman Huffsetler, members of the Senate Committee
on Finance, some Dr. Stephen Owens,
the Education Director of the Georgia Budget and Policy
Institute, we have a longstanding opposition
to public funds being used for private educational expenses.
Just a couple of things to think about on the inputs
and then output side on inputs.
If we could close the loop to not allow businesses
to claim this donation as a business expense,
It can make money for corporations to, quote unquote,
donate if it's a dollar for dollar tax credit.
It's hard to imagine that as charity.
But you can donate to these SSOs and then you
can claim on the federal taxes as business expenses.
This is advertised on SSO websites.
This is not some mystery.
We could close that loop like some other states have
so it could be seen more as a charity
that it's being advertised as.
And then if we could also maybe talk about a cap on the credit
for corporations.
one of these student scholarship organizations is held
together by one donation every year of a million dollars
from one corporation, which means they have at least
$1.3 million of liability to state of Georgia.
A million of that instead is going to an SSO.
And then 10% of that is going to the salary of the CFO
of that SSO.
So just kind of what does it look like to have a tighter
auditing controls over how this money is being spent.
And then finally, I really want to thank y'all
for the amendments that y'all brought forward.
We really appreciate that.
One I would like to add as well,
is if we could have some understanding
of the boundaries that private schools have put
on who they would enroll.
If this really is about parent empowerment,
if the private schools could publicly list
who they would not educate,
I think it would help parents know,
have a better idea of the choices
that they're allowed to make
and it not just be a private school choice bill.
All right, we probably won't have time today
for the amendments you're talking about,
but appreciate your testimony.
Apparently I miss Claire Suggs,
so if you wanna come up quickly and...
Good afternoon.
Yes, my name is Claire Suggs,
and I am with Paige,
the Professional Association of Georgia Educators.
And Paige does have a position,
we are not supportive of voucher programs.
Though I do want to recognize and thank you
for the consideration of expanding the transparency
around this program.
Though it has been in operation for well over a decade,
it's never been evaluated.
So having additional information
would be hugely helpful to really understand
the impact that this has had on students.
I also do want to point out that in code right now,
there is a requirement that an analysis be done in 2023.
So I would ask you to consider before moving ahead
with raising the cap, if you would wait until that analysis
has been completed and ideally until the amendments
that Senator Estevez has proposed,
so that we really do have an understanding
of how this is affecting children.
All right, we're gonna have to appreciate your comments.
Senator Hickman, you had a comment.
Because of the significance of these members,
I make a motion that we table this
to the next meeting.
Okay, so we've got a motion a second to table. I don't think there's any discussion on a motion like that. All those in favor of tabling raise your hand.
Okay, so we've got a majority that wants the table to build at this point. So we will stop right there. Yeah, I'm sure you would.
All right, thank you committee for your work on this.
