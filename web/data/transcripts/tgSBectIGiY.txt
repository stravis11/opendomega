Chaplain after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our
Chaplain this morning will be introduced by the Lady from the 156 House District
Representative Lisa Hagen, Representative Hagen.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good morning, colleagues.
It's my distinct honor and privilege to introduce to you this morning my good friend and my
pastor, the Reverend Jason Davis.
We attend Grace Community Presbyterian Church in Lions and he has been our pastor since it was planted in 2015.
He does a wonderful job of faithfully preaching from the scriptures every Sunday and we just feel so fortunate to have him as our pastor and I'm just so thankful that he was able to come up this morning and share a word with us.
us. So thank you Pastor Jason for being here this morning.
Good morning, House of Representatives. It is an honor to be with you all this morning.
I appreciate this opportunity. And the Holy Bible in Romans chapter 13, Paul says,
let every person be subject to the governing authorities. There is no authority
There is no authority except from God and those that exist have been instituted by God.
Therefore, whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed and Paul goes on from there.
If we were to read a little farther, we would realize that Paul teaches two things in that account.
That God raises up the government leaders that he so chooses.
And the government leaders that he raises up are his servants and ministers for the good of the people
that they serve. Everyone who are here in this legislature this morning have been hand-chosen
of the Lord God Almighty to be here for such a time as this. You are the ones that God
has sovereignly chosen. For this place and time, God is the governor of the universe.
Ultimately, of course, He made it. He created the world. His authorship and ownership of
the world is the reason that he has authority and all other authority that we
experience is not intrinsic but extrinsic. It's been delegated by the Lord and
God has seen fit in his good and perfect will to raise up gifted men and
women like yourselves to lead and govern on his behalf. In other words every
authority in the final analysis is established not by a democratic vote or
popular appointment but by the single appointment of the supreme ruler of
heaven and earth. Paul is saying there that the president of the United States
right down to the town council member of the most potent of small towns couldn't
exercise his or her office for five minutes apart from the will of the ultimate
ruler, God himself. And that means a couple of things. It means that each of you will
be accountable, of course, to the Lord one day for the job that you were doing here even
today, working hard to represent your constituents well and to serve them for their best interest.
So to call you to a strong sense of duty, but it also means that you can call in prayer
upon the one that raised you up. It just follows that if God has raised you up for this
office at this time that you can call on him for help when you need it. Paul goes on
in that passage, secondly, to say that you are God's servants and ministers for the good
of those that you govern. One of my favorite theologians is the late R. C. Sproul, well-loved,
respected pastor and theologian. And he was once invited to give an invocation at an
inaugural prayer breakfast for a Florida governor at one point during his ministry.
And Dr. Sproul in that address explained that when pastors are consecrated to the ministry,
they're ordained.
And that ordination, he said, is a sacred occasion because we take vows to be faithful to God
and the fulfillment of our ministerial office in the church.
And then Sproul told the Florida governor, he said,
Sir, today is your ordination day,
because you are being ordained as God's minister
of civil righteousness.
It was the governor's ordination day
because civil magistrates like yourselves
are ordained by God.
They are God's ministers put there to be a blessing
to the people that they represent.
through governing for the well-being of their constituents.
Everyone, I want you to hear this morning
that you are ministers and servants.
Those are the exact words that the Apostle Paul uses
in Romans chapter 13.
You are ministers and servants to be a blessing
on behalf of those that God has raised you up to represent.
And if God has raised you up
as his chosen ministers and servants to the state of Georgia,
you know that he is watching.
So do it well, do it for the people that you represent,
and do it for the one that puts you here.
Do it for his smile, for his approval,
for his pleasure, and for his joy.
Well, I'll just leave you all in closing with this.
We live in the greatest state in the nation, don't we?
Yes, the state of Georgia.
And you all obviously think so,
and that you're here giving your time and abilities
and service to our great state.
God has put us here during 2021, but I will encourage you who are resting your souls
by grace through faith in Jesus on the cross.
To lift your eyes above the here and now and realize that as great as being here in America
is and as great as being here representing the state of Georgia is, that we are meant
for another state, for another country.
The writer of Hebrew says that we are looking
for another state, another country,
one that has foundations.
One who's architect and builder is God.
That's the writer of Hebrew's way of saying
that we're citizens ultimately of God's kingdom.
And Jesus is our ultimate sovereign, everyone.
And our forever future is to be with Him
in the glories of the new heavens and new earth.
That means this morning that for you all who are in Christ,
best is yet to come. Let's pray, everyone.
Heavenly Father Paul says elsewhere in 1 Timothy 2,
that he urges that supplications and prayers and
intercessions and thanks-givings be made for all people.
And so I pray for this. House of Representatives today.
I thank you for each and every one of them.
It is you that has raised each of them up for a time and
in place is this to represent and to serve their constituents well to be your servants
and a govern father on your behalf.
I pray that you would give them joy in their work, pray that you would give them help,
pray that you would give them wisdom that they might lead well.
Father, remind them all day long that they are doing this ultimately by your appointment
and for your glory, amen.
You join me in the pledge.
A pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America
and to the Republic for which it stands.
One nation under God, indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all.
Thank you, everyone.
Doorkeepers will unlock the doors.
The chair recognizes Chairman Hogan, the chair of the Committee
on information and audits.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Your committee on information and audits has read the journal
of the previous legislative day and found it to be correct.
And furthermore, Mr. Speaker, I think it's about time we have
on Irish blessing.
May your joys be as deep as the oceans.
Your troubles as light as its foam.
And may you find sweet peace of mind wherever you may roam.
Outstanding Chairman Hogan the chair of the Committee on Information and
Audits reports that the Journal of the previous legislative day has been read and
found to be correct. Is there any objection to the confirmation of the
Journal? The chair here is none and the journal is confirmed. The clerk will read the
The resolution establishing the order of business for the day.
Mr. Burns, owner of 15 of us following me establishes the order of business during the first
part of the period unanimous consensus, introduction of bills and resolutions, first reading and
reference of house bills and resolutions, morning orders.

That completes first reading.
Second reading of bills and resolutions, there are none.
No reports of standing committees were going on now to morning orders.
This House will come to order.
House will come to order.
Please give attention to the members in the well for morning orders.
We've got a number of people that have signed up,
who chair is going to limit each morning order
to not more than two minutes.
Two minutes per morning order.
Chair recognizes the vice chair
of the majority caucus representative gravely.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, friends.
I want you to hear me closely this morning.
Mia Motto Masashi says, perception is strong and sight is weak.
In strategy, it is important to see distant things as if they were close into
take a distant view of close things.
Ladies and gentlemen, there's possibly a member of our body here who can do neither of what
I just read because they lost their glasses.
And I found these out there on the street this morning, our money exchange, they're a
nice pair of glasses because I have mine, I was able to see close up things from a distance.
I'm hoping the same for you. Let me know if you've lost a pair of glasses. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes the minority caucus whip representative Wilkerson for a morning order.
Mr. Speaker, I think this body is recognized how mental health issues have impacted people
across this state.
I think many of us can tell stories of family members and the generational impact it has
on us.
And this body has taken a lead in doing some great work
and a bipartisan effort.
Today, I come up here to talk about what they're doing
in Cobb County.
I want to recognize my sheriff, Sheriff Craig Owens,
for instituting the first 24-7 mental health facility
in a jail.
And this is important for many reasons.
One, 70% of the inmates in Cobb County
and many jails have mental health issues, 70%.
On top of that, these individuals
will one day transition back to society.
And so the goal is that they will have a soft landing
where they get the help they need as they come back in.
So what I would love to see is I would love to see this body
continue the work it's doing, and unfortunately,
it cost a lot of money to do this,
that we put some money behind this in the budget next year
and work together to be able to do this
and the other 158 counties that are impacted.
And like I said, I've talked to many of you
who have had family members impacted by this.
And I just want to say thank you to Sheriff Owens
for doing this.
And I want to say thank you to this body
for all the work you're doing.
And I would love to continue to do
some great things together again.
Thank you.
Chair recognizes Chairman Parsons for a morning order.
Thank you, Speaker Austin. I'll just take my two minutes here. I know people have obviously
noticed the rising prices in gasoline, hard not to, but I don't know how many people
I know some have, but I don't know how many people have noticed the rising price of natural
gas. And it's risen over the last year, 150, maybe even 200% here in the United States.
Europe, it's risen 500 percent. I saw the other day where the Putin has kind of opened
up the spickets for Europe and letting them have more of the gas, and that's where most
of the gas, almost all the gas from in Europe comes from. But anyway, we're, you know,
there's a lot of, like everything else, a lot of disinformation about the rising prices,
whether it's gasoline or natural gas, and we're having an energy utilities and telecommunications
is having a committee meeting or a hearing this afternoon at 3, up in 403 trying to get
to to find out what the real issues are, what's causing the rises in the price and particularly
the natural gas. And what they see long term, so we have people from industry, industry
observers, experts coming in and I would invite, of course certainly what the members there,
but this would also be webcasts, members of the house and people out there in the public.
I would certainly be welcome, I would invite you to come in and see if we can get some
of the actual facts about what's causing these prices because that's the only thing.
And people are going to start asking you, depending on how cold this winter is, not just
here in Georgia, but across the country, the colder it is, the more the shortages are
going to be and the higher the prices are going to be.
So I think it would be important to tune into it.
We live in an age of information.
It seems like we live in an age of disinformation.
That's a whole other topic that I'll talk about another time.
Well, one quote.
From a general who's not very popular,
has not been very popular here in Georgia
with the years, certainly a long time ago,
William T. Cumpsey Sherman said.
William T. Cumpsey Sherman said,
people will believe a delusion harder
than they will believe the fact.
Thank you.
He must could see into the future, Chair recognizes for a morning order representative Bentley,
Chairman Dickie, and Representative Butler for a morning order.
This is it.
Good morning, colleagues.
And thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I'm so proud to stand here this morning and announce that today is a special day in
in the state of Georgia.
It is the birthday of Mr. Lester P down in Butler, Georgia.
He celebrated his 91st birthday on today.
Happy birthday, Mr. Lester P.
And I asked the chairman, my focus
from America's chairman, Robert Dickey,
from New Zealand, and representative, Debbie Buckner,
from Junction City, to join me in this big announcement,
because P brothers and cooperated
that served the state of Georgia for many, many years.
With Georgia being the number one state to do business,
we are proud to have P brothers incorporated in our state
for over 70 years.
P brothers is a Christian based family business
found on values of ethical standards,
open dialogue, and truthfulness.
And Mr. Lester, we are all here celebrating
your 91st birthday here in his family
or back home watching this morning.
So today is Mr. Lester Pee's day in the state of Georgia.
So thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you, colleagues.
And we're celebrating the birthday of Mr. Lester Pee.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Good job.
Chair recognizes Representative Cannon for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good morning, members.
I'm here today to bring some attention to the need
for us to advocate for at-risk renters
in the state of Georgia.
As many of you may have attended this morning,
DCA held a conversation with legislators
about the ERA, the Emergency Rental Assistance Funds
that have been given by the federal government.
And at this point, the percentage of how much has been spent
by the state of Georgia is 9% out of that total amount
which is alarming and it is necessary for us all
to think about how during COVID-19 this pandemic,
lots of unemployment, there are many families
who are challenged right now with those rental payments.
So anything you can do possibly to reach out
to your DCI representatives
and to also speak with your constituents
would be really appreciated in this time.
Thank you very much.
Chair recognizes, Chairman Houston, Chairman Dempsey, Chairman Darlene Taylor,
Chairman Cooper, Speaker Pro Tem Jones, Representative Oliver, Representative Lot,
Chairman Tankersley, Chairman Ballinger, Chairman Rich, Chairman Lynn Smith,
Chair and Chairman Matheak for a morning order.
Good morning.
This is a surprise for Speaker Raulston,
but it's no surprise to the female leaders
standing up here today,
and we have one Democratic leader as well.
The House Republican Lady Chairs asked for this brief
order to recognize Speaker Rauston for appointing several Republican women as
chairs of House Committees and our wonderful Mary Margaret Oliver as chair
of Marthock. A comment was made yesterday that in Georgia it is still rare for
women in Georgia to have elected office. Well we stand here today to debunk that
myth not only were we elected but we have excelled in leadership roles
We thank our constituents for giving us the opportunity to serve and we thank our speaker for recognizing our talents.

recognizes Chairman Cooper for an announcement.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I feel to realize what creatures of habits we are.
When I ask everybody to bring a gift, a Christmas gift for Toys, for Toss, and put them in
the boxes down as we go out of the Capitol, I'm used to coming in the L.O.B. in the Vista's
entrance.
And yesterday I had three people that had brought gifts
asked me where the boxes were.
Okay guys, this is a reminder to bring a toy
to make some child that will not be as fortunate
as your children happy at Christmas and the boxes.
You get off the elevator on first floor,
you turn to the right, you turn to the right
like you're gonna go out of the building
and there are two boxes there on either side, right before
you get to the officers and it says,
So hopefully you will find those boxes and thank you to everybody that's already brought a toy.
Thanks.
