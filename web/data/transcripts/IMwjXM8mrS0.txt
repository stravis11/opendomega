All members voted if so. Mr. Clerk, please lock the machines. Our keepers will please close the doors and keep them closed. As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by an old friend, the gentleman from the 61st House District, Representative Roger Bruce. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, everybody. It's always a pleasure when you can call your pastor, your friend as well. You can have conversations with your pastor and the answer to every question is not always you have to have faith. Most of the time when they say that, they mean they don't know the answer, but the reality is that you can have conversations about things that are important to you, important to your family, important to the things that are going on. And that's the biggest pleasure that I get out of being a member of Impact United Methodist Church, where the Reverend Paul Tibido is the pastor. And I'm going to do sometimes we sit in the back and say whoever is up here is talking too much and then give the pastor enough time to talk, so I'm not going to be guilty of that. But I do want to say that the church is a sizable church, but it's not about the size of the church, it's about the things that they do. And during COVID, the church provided food and provided vaccines, we did testing, we did everything to show that the church was about more than just conversation. It was about service. And with that, I'd like to ask you to join me in welcoming the Reverend Paul Tibido to our chamber. Good morning everybody. I want to thank the speaker of the House, John Burns, and I want to thank a member of Impact Church representative Roger Bruce for the opportunity to be here to share with you this morning. If you all would indulge me this morning and turn to somebody next to you and say it's going to be okay. Now, if you can indulge me one more time and turn to somebody else and say really, it's going to be okay. So as we come back together, coincidentally this morning, coincidentally this morning, I am going to speak a little bit about faith, but I want to explain it a little bit. Hebrews 111 says, now faith is being sure of what we hope for, being convinced of what we do not see. So I ask a question, have you really concentrated on these words, it's going to be okay. Sometimes these words are dismissal of our own pain or the complexity of our situation. And I'm sure you can attest that there may be days where in this room you experience a complex situation. Can I get an amen? But somehow there is peace and comfort from God that can be found in the middle of the storm. It's going to be okay as one of those most hope-filled sentiments that can be offered to others. And one, I choose to believe for myself. The writer of Hebrews says, now faith is being sure of what we hope for, being convinced of what we do not see. That's where hope comes from. There is hope for the hearing now. We have the assurance, the evidence of things not seeing that no matter what happens, God is still on His throne. In your most intense, your most contentious discussions, I challenge you to know, trust and believe that it's going to be okay and that God desires for it to be okay. If we think about the hope that is in the Bible, it brings the question, what is biblical hope? It is tethering to the future what we know about God's past faithfulness. In defining faith as being sure of what we hope for, the writer of Hebrews gives us an insight into hope. And let's chew on this for a bit. Biblical hope is not a wish. A wish is something we want to receive or to happen. I wish I had a bigger house. I wish we could come together and get this vote done. I wish I had a small waste. I wish I didn't kill.

carry around. If you're like me, I wish I didn't carry around so much ice on my six pack. I wish we could work better together. Maybe it will happen that's our wish. But in contrast, biblical hope is a certainty that our ultimate future rests in God's capable and loving hands. It is an assurance that the invisible God is faithful and has a good plan for my visible life. It is an assurance that God is working on each of us. It is the invisible becoming visible. The visible that we can love one another, work with one another, accept one another and make this world better with one another. This hope says we will get the vote done. It says we will work it out together. Old Testament writers use several Hebrew words for hope. One is kawa, which means hope in the sense of trust. As when the prophet Jeremiah said to God, our hope is in you. New Testament writers use the Greek word huppomina for hope. It means to wait. It means to be patient. It means to endure. It means to persevere under misfortunes and trials and to hold fast to one's faith. We get a picture of hope as these biblical words define it in the life of the Apostle Paul encountered struggle after struggle. But never lost hope that everything was going to be okay. And he assured others as I come to assure you this morning. Sometimes it may take years to put the pieces back together from the wrecking ball of pain that different things have caused in our lives. The atrocities we've endured and all the turmoil of what is happening around our world today may tempt us to believe that someone other than God is writing our stories. What the author Sharon Janus says, but God has the power to redeem what we consider unredeemable to heal what we consider fatally wounded and to make our worst chapters our greatest victories. So as I get ready to close, don't stop the message when the foundation of our faith gets cracked. Don't quit when opinions differ. Don't stop communicating when it seems no one is listening. Don't stop explaining your chapter when others don't want to hear your story. Don't stop standing for what you believe when others are falling for anything. Don't stop talking to one another when your truth is challenged. And don't stray from your purpose and your call, value all the opinions that are expressed so that we all can hear the words that say it's going to be okay. You're going to be okay. God has more to write. So I challenge you today. Do your part to help everything be okay. Strife or unity, lean into togetherness, work towards community, and let's find that reality, that truth that God says everything will be okay. Let us pray. God, we trust you. No matter what happens this side of heaven, we know it's going to be okay because you have a purpose and you have a plan. We might not like the situation or understand the observation, but we trust you without reservation. The outcome may not even be in our favor, but it's going to be okay. And so as we close this prayer there are other names that we can offer up, but I offer up this prayer in the name of Jesus that the people of God say amen. Will you now join me in the Pledge of Legends? Reverend Tipitone, that's the message we need to hear and we appreciate you bringing that message and continued good luck and keep building and keep Roger engaged in the church. I know you will and we just appreciate you being here and bringing that message. Thanks for serving the chaplain. The door keepers will unlock the doors. Members may join the pastor in the south any room for photos. Chairman Tarvan, the chair of the Committee on Information and Audits has recognized. Chairman Tarvan. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Georgia is one of the largest wings in the country and the squadron in Peachtree City at Falconfield is not only the largest in the state but it's the second largest in the nation. What I'd like to do is just recognize a few folks that are part of that group. We've got the Georgia Wing Commander, Colonel Jeffrey Garrett, Cadet Major, Vinci'nzo Powers, Cadet Captain Tiffany Dang. Cadet Second Lieutenant Juliana Vega and Cadet Senior Airman Jamie Shore. These folks as well as all the cadets are up here in the gallery. If you'd please stand and recognize them. Woohoo! Good looking group. Good birchette is recognized for a morning order. With birchette. Are your folks here? Okay. We're going to wave. Representative Trane, are you ready? Representative Trane is recognized for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today is Vietnam Day at the Capitol. If you served in the Vietnam War, please come join me here because I want to talk about the Vietnamese community here in Georgia. So on April 30, 1975, the city of Saigon fell and South Vietnamese soldiers and American soldiers evacuated to America. At that time, around 8,000 Vietnamese relocated to Georgia. And if you wonder why, it's because of Savannah Hunter's Air Force Base. My dad, who was just an 18-year-old putzen around in the rice fields, was grabbed by American soldiers and said, do you want to go to America? And he didn't really speak English, so he just nodded. And next thing you know, he was at Savannah Hunter's Air Force Base, getting trained as a special forces helicopter pilot. And so that's why many Vietnamese relocated to Georgia in the late 70s, early 80s. And this community has grown to nearly 70,000 owning businesses, serving as doctors, teachers, their students, their kids, our students in our schools serving in civil air patrol, playing on athletic fields, competing in international competition. So if I can ask my Vietnamese community to please stand up. You are a very valued member of Georgia. Thank you for being here at the Capitol. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. That was nice. Welcome. We're glad to have you here. We appreciate everything you contribute to our great state of Georgia. Thank you, Representative Tran. That was an outstanding morning order. Representative Holly and the Henry County delegation, all the Henry County delegation, join the representative Holly. The gentleman is recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Ryzen Shion.

We have Jellies there. We have bags available for you. But we really want to highlight that fortunately, Henry County has won the number one Chamber of Commerce Award in the entire nation. All right? So great businesses. We welcome everyone. If you're going to drive south on 75 and you come to a stop, you might as well come in and stay. Thank you all.

And our livestock chotein of Chairman Camp and LeHood and Lim and Terry England and Tom Kirby, we beat the pants off the Senate down there. So I just want to, you know, we get real competitive with the Senate and I'm just glad we had this trophy down in the Ag Committee room and we're going to keep it there. I hope it has a permanent place there, but we're going to have another competition. Many of you have asked about being on the team this year. We had a dream team last year and so we'll have trials maybe this year for some of y'all.

A resolution recognizing and commending minutes to De Aura O'Brien on his outstanding public service. Chairman John Carson is recognized for purposes of a special introduction. Chairman Carson. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Many of you think that my family originally comes from Cobb County or Israel, one of the other. But we actually, my family comes from Northern Ireland. Before it was Northern Ireland. And I thought it'd be great to help in the lead up to St. Patrick's Day to celebrate with having a minister from the government in Dublin. Minister Dara O'Brien was born and raised in Malahide County Dublin, not far from New Rhee. He was, he's held various positions within the, the, he, I'm going to pronounce, try to pronounce this. I don't really do well with Irish gay like I'm more southern American, Irish more than I think. E-Ructus, which is basically their parliament, including vice chair of the Public Accounts Committee, member of the Committee on Justice, Equality of Defense and Law Reform, and leader of the Fianna fall in Sina, Shana, and opposition front bitch, spokesperson on Dublin, foreign affairs and housing. How'd I do? With that, with no further ado, can we show a very short video in regard to our relationship with Ireland? On this 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, we recognize an unparalleled achievement that brought peace. To leadership within Northern Ireland, the Irish and British governments, our international partners, and the enduring friendship of the United States. Never have I felt the sense of gratification and responsibility, gratitude that I feel today. In particular, we express our appreciation for the United States leadership and support for the process of peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland. Relations between the Ireland of Ireland and the US have spanned generations and political traditions and continue to grow in depth. The ongoing energy of the Irish diaspora has inspired countless US political leaders, members of Congress, advisors, and diplomats to change history through their contribution to the peace process. And so I ask you to build on the opportunity you have before you, to believe that the future can be better than the past, to work together because you have so much more to gain by working together than by drifting apart. Have the patience to work for a just and lasting peace. Reach for it. The United States will reach with you. Today, support from the US is as important as ever as an honest broker, friend to all sides, and supporter of the Good Friday Agreement. As you well know, the peace agreement was the beginning, not the end. We look forward to what we can achieve together in the next 25 years. and Miss Ehmö Nolen, Vice Consult of Ireland, and here in Atlanta. and we have two members of their staff here in the gallery, I believe, with no further ado, Minister Dara O'Brien from Dublin. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Dave Guder, Wajin, Nugas, Gurdamita Mahagweva, Sankara, Kun, Lauer, Livin, Yugas, Gahora, Anor. Thank you very much. Speaker Burns, representatives, ladies and gentlemen for the honor and the invitation to address you here this morning in this fine chamber. It is a great honor for me and my delegation to be here in George's House of Representatives. And I want to thank you, Speaker Burns, and Representative Carson, for facilitating our visit this morning. It's quite likely that 200 years ago, my relatives in Dublin only 60 miles down the road from Representative Carson's could have very well known each other. So just the paths diverged, but we're back here now. So as an elected representative for the people of Dublin thing, all on behalf of the government of Ireland, I want to wish you our warmest St. Patrick's Day greetings. Ireland deeply values its ties with Georgia, Irish America, as traditionally as you might know, been more associated with the Northeast, with Boston, with Chicago, and New York. But the truth is that our bonds here in the South are really strong and enduring. Around 9% of Georgians claim Irish or Scots Irish heritage. And there are thousands of Irish-born men and women living here in Georgia today. Irish business and investment is flocking here with over 7,000 Georgians employed by Irish companies. And incredibly for our small country, your country of just 5 million people, we're the eighth largest source of foreign direct investment in here in the Peachtate. The fulcrum of Ireland's presence in the US is moving southward. And Atlanta was our first consulate in the southeast, open in 2010, and really ably led by Kuivini Kroher here and her team in Atlanta. And we've since added Austin, LA, and Miami. And we know that so much of America's future, and indeed its potential, is here in the South. This St. Patrick's Day, we're marking three very important events here in Ireland. Progress is an independent, prosperous, and peaceful nation. We're marking 100 years of Ireland in the world. Since 1923, when Ireland joined the League of Nations. And after centuries of British rule, our country took its place amongst the independent nations of the world. Secondly, we're marking 50 years membership of the European Union, the world's greatest piece and economic cooperation project, which laid the foundation for a confident modern Ireland that we have today. One of the most highly developed and outward looking nations in the world. And thirdly, as you've seen in the video, we're commemorating 25 years of the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, a landmark agreement of peace to bring peace to our Ireland between both peoples. And it would not have happened without our friends from the United States, from both sides of the aisle, successive presidents who've underpinned this agreement. And I want to thank you on behalf of the Irish government for that. We thank you for all your friendship, for the welcome that you've given me in the delegation here this morning. But right across Atlanta, and indeed, I'll be traveling to Savannah tomorrow. All of your citizens have been fantastic.

to us and our partnership with Georgia has never been stronger. And we look forward to what we can achieve together in the years to come. And I want to wish you finally a very happy St. Patrick's Day that's coming up. All of the best of blessings for St. Patrick's Day. Banak Dina Fala, Paul Drick, Ur of Galaire, Gourmet Amalguiv. Thank you very much. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. Thank you so much. It's my pleasure. Minister of Prime is always good. It's always a good day to be Irish, right? But especially doing St. Patrick's Day week. I look forward to joining you in Savannah. There are a couple of Irish folks that claim a little bit of connection to Ireland down in Savannah in that port city. So we're especially proud of our legacy and our heritage coming from Ireland and our four parents. And we look forward to the continued cooperation and success of working country to country. And we just appreciate all the good things that happen in Ireland and we look forward to working with you. Thanks for being here. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, we need to get on. Members, thank you for your attention. We're going to move on to our rules, Caldera. The clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 4646. Senate Bill 46 by Senate. The House of the 52nd and others will be titled an act to amend Chapter 17 to Title 31. The Fish Go to Georgia, Anitator, relating to control of sexually transmitted disease. So as a result, require physicians and health care providers to test all pregnant women for HIV and syphilis at the first prenatal visit. This bill I'm referring to the Committee on Public Health, that committee recommends a disbale. Do pass. Chair recognizes, Chair Lady Cooper, to present the bill. Chair Lady Cooper is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, the House, I bring to you the substitute to Senate Bill 46. This is the bill that would help us come back our rising cases of HIV and syphilis, especially among pregnant women. When we still have a chance to not only help the mother, but keep the infant from being severely defect with severe problems that can affect them all of their lives, the bill simply does say that physicians and hospitals are whoever's taken care of the pregnant lady will test them for HIV and syphilis. We'll go for their first visit at another point in their pregnancy and when they at 28 to 32 weeks gestation, when they go for a visit and when they come in to deliver. This way, we can hopefully catch mothers who are infected with syphilis and treat the mother and do preventing measures for the infant in the womb before severe damage is done that will last a lifetime and the same with HIV. And with that, Mr. Speaker, I will yield the well and ask for the members to give me a considerable vote on the substitute to Senate Bill 46. If the lady will yield the well just for a moment, suspend. I know the Irish were just here and we were talking about St. Patrick's Day, but we're going to have to wait till tomorrow afternoon or maybe Friday for the parade to get started. So we need your attention, give your attention to the member in the well and we're going to take some questions if you don't mind, chair lady, because I had forgotten my duty and let the noise level get a little too high in here and some folks didn't hear you. You didn't hear your presentation all of it. So lady yield, yes or all yield. Riverson even more is recognized for a question. Good morning, good morning, General Lee. I will yield. Just wanted to ask a question. Why were testing? Did we not want to test for AIDS as well? This is very, very important to women in health care with babies. Well, if you were testing for HIV, it would also pick up that the lady had progressed from HIV into AIDS. Well, no, that doesn't necessarily happen. I've been in women's health care for almost 30 years and I know for a fact that when we do test, we don't isolate them. We only test for one or the other if it's required, but no one has tested for AIDS. And you have to treat a baby and a mother differently when you are in a delivery room, especially protecting everyone around them. It's kind of like SARS. I know that the gentlewoman knows of what she speaks, but that is not the information I have and this is a public health request. I will, so we need to take care of this at least at this point and hopefully we'll pick it up early before the mother has moved to AIDS and their just HIV positive. But I will run that through you and if we need to come back with a bill next year that specifically says, well, taste for AIDS, I will do that. Is the gentleman lady yield again? I will yield. It is important because it is a separate test. It is billed separately, so we need to know that. Testing for HIV and then testing for AIDS are two different things in the laboratory and two different billable things. So one of insurance companies may not pay for. Well, most of our large majority of women that deliver in this state or are pregnant are under our Medicaid program. And this is a big issue with us. And so I will check that out for you and see what we can do to change it. Because not every pregnant or woman is on Medicaid. I realize that. Chair, lady, you have one more question to your left. Chair, camp has a question to your left. Does the gentleman yield? I do. Thank you. Isn't it true that there is no definitive test for AIDS because it is a collection of infections and viruses. And therefore the HIV testing is the prudent testing to determine if someone has HIV. I'm sure the lady knows of what she speaks. Thank you for the question. You have no further questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yell the well and once again ask for a favorable vote from members of the House. Thank you. Chair Cooper has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair, here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair has none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill. The yeas are 169. The nays are two. The bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Members, I'm going to suspend from the rules calendar just for a moment. We have our dedicated physicians who come down and take care of us every day during this session. So we had our physician was presented earlier and her great qualifications were acknowledged. So our physician of the day. Thank you, Speaker Burns. And thank you to my representative Jones for the previous introduction. I would be remiss if I were here and didn't come to the House to extend my gratitude for the work and service that you all do individually and collectively. I'm very happy to be able to thank medical association of Georgia for the opportunity to do what I believe is my civil duty and serve you today in the medical room along with the amazing Miss Julia. I'm proud to be able to serve alongside with you as we both look to strive to ensure that the citizens of Georgia have access to and resources. I would like to thank the guests who have received high quality health care in their pursuit of happiness. Thank you so much for everything that you do and thank you, Speaker Burns, for the opportunity. Thank you, Dr. Kelly. I've had a good conversation and very enjoyable. And we are most pleased you're here doing your civic duty. Thank you for being here. I know all members understand we do have our rules calendar that was set yesterday and then we have an additional House supplemental rules calendar that we'll take up this morning. So we're going to miss clerk. Will you read the caption to Senate Bill 120 120 120. The Senate Bill 120 by Senator Eccles 49th and others to be titled an act to amend Code Section 41 8. The official code of Georgia annotated related to safe operation and motor carriers commercial motor vehicles and drivers and safe transportation of hazardous materials. So as to update the reference date to federal regulations regarding the safe operation of motor carriers. Mr. Delam referred to the Committee on Motor Vehicles that committee recommends the dispel do pass. The lady from Henry County is recognized to present the bill. Representative Daniel. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, guys. I guess it's getting closer to the afternoon. I'm here to talk about Senate Bill 120. It is a companion bill to the motor carrier compliance bill that I carried over earlier this year. And you guys voted unanimously to pass that. I hope you will also give me your favorable consideration today. Just a reminder, this is a simple date update keeps us in compliance with federal regulations. And I would appreciate your vote and take any questions if you have them. If not, I yield the well. There are no questions and the lady has yielded the well. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is not in the previous question is ordered. Is there an objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is not in the next question. The report of the committee has agreed to show this bill now pass. All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill. The a's were 169 and the a's were zero. The bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 128. Senate Bill 128. Senate Bill 128 by Senator Albers, 56th and others to be entitled to amend Article 7, Chapter 20, Title 47 of the Fish Coda, Georgia, annotated the public retirement system's investment authority law. So it was raised limit for total percentages of funds that the peace officers and newty and benefit fund may invest in alternative investments. This bill I would refer to the committee on retirement. That committee recommends this bill do pass. Chair recognizes representative Hitchens to present the bill. Thank you very much, Madam Speaker Pro Tem. This really is a simple bill. A lot of people say when they get up here, but it affects one of the state retirement systems. The peace officers and newty and benefit fund. And what it does is the same thing we've already done twice this year with the fireman's pension fund and with the state employees pension fund. What it does is it allows them to use 5% more and invest 5% more in alternative investments to try and diversify their portfolio and have everybody has done it so far as it's had great success. And that's all this bill does. It has a question. Chair recognizes representative Clark at the 100-naked district. Thank you, Madam Speaker. Does it gentlemen yield? So do you know exactly who or what company the peace officer and newty benefit fund uses for alternative investments? I have no idea to be honest. They have professional people that are on the board that handle the funds. Okay. Well, actually I looked it up and it is AEW core properties, which is a private real estate investment trust company. And so far the fund has already invested about $40 million into this. And it is a private real estate investment company. Do you know what types of investments this company invests in across the country? I do not. Further inquiry or does the gentleman further yield? Can you speak up a little bit? I can hardly hear you. Does the gentleman further yield? Sure. All right. So many of us in this chamber have expressed concerns about affordable housing and the affordable housing crisis. And one of the major issues that people have expressed is that investors and hedge funds are buying up housing inventory from hardworking Georgians that just want to fulfill their American dream for home ownership. And so I wanted to ask, is increased investment in this private real estate investment trust potentially going to lead to increased investment in the affordable housing crisis that is currently negatively affecting Georgia families? I have no idea the people that do the investments are certainly the ones that you need to talk to. Thank you. Chair recognizes the chairman of the retirement committee representative Carson for a question. This is gentleman yield. Sure. Are you to my friend? Thank you for bringing this bill. Is it not true that this bill all this does is increase the amount allowable into alternative investments from 10 to 15%. That's exactly correct. Is the gentleman further yield? Are you? Those in alternative investments in higher yielding such higher rates of returns on private equity investments where other funds including peace officers and newty benefit fund has seen returns in the teens as much as 20% per year. That's correct. And the two funds that have already done this have had very positive benefits from it. And final problem, Eric, is it not true that the P.O. would be themselves brought this to us because they want more diversification and higher returns? Is that not true? And that's correct. And there are no state funds in this retirement fund. They're all based on they get they get certain percentage of traffic fines from across the state. And each member this this covers local county and state law enforcement officers. Each member pays a monthly stipend into the fund for a retirement program. Thank you very much for bringing this bill. Thank you. Chair recognizes representative Martin for a question. Thank you, Senator Chairman Hitchman. You'll for question. Are you? Isn't it true what you're trying to do as chairman Carson said is allow them to in fast 5% more. And is it further true that by doing that it doesn't mean that they have to use the same investment there you're you're allowing them to do 5% more in that pool of assets not with that particular conflict. That's correct. And we all know these in these retirement funds have professional people that administer the fund that are very knowledgeable in this area. And they try and invest in in the areas where they're going to get the best benefit for their for their retirement program. Right. And last question is the gentleman. You know, isn't it further true that these professional people would seek even across this 15% that's going into alternate investments to diversify appropriately. And it doesn't isn't true that it doesn't necessarily mean it would go into an investment with any particular company. That's that's true. And I think in these times everybody realizes that diversification and investments is is a very potent act. Chair recognizes representative Evans for a question so much for a simple bill. Thank you. Miss speaker and thank you chairman for this bill. Yes. Isn't it true that after reading the dangerous dwellings series in the Atlanta Journal Constitution this past fall that my has been and I both talked with their investment advisor. And I encourage all of us in this body that have investments to consider checking in with your investment advisor to see about if we are investing in these reads that that may be exploitative. And I appreciate the what what the general woman from the hundred and eighth has brought up. I think really this is a question for all of us in this body. Yes, they brought very high returns but at what expense. And so I support this bill. But I do think we all encourage all of us in this body to look at what we're investing in and what. And and to consider disinvesting in these companies that are that made their affecting housing for the poor people in our state. Thank you. And I'll say again question is there question. Thank you ma'am. Isn't it true? Gentlemen care to take further questions. Certainly. The chair recognizes representative Sains for question. Does the gentleman yield a who is it not true that this fund is to the benefit of hard work and men and women who've protected our state for multiple years in that they expect our fiduciary obligation to be to them and to ensure that they have the highest return on their investment. And that's correct. And as I said before the state has no money in this. It's a state retirement fund. But it's all it's all based on their monthly payments. And I think it's a 3% add on for all traffic lines across the state. This fund has been in effect for about 60 70 years. Chair recognizes representative fry for question. Thank you. Isn't it true that while these points that were bringing up about the investment firms are true and this good points that the $40 million that's invested has already been invested. But this will allow our peace officers to receive higher returns on their own retirement in the future. That's the attempt. Okay. And I'll be supporting this bill and I thank you for bringing it. But I appreciate the points that were brought up as well. Certainly. Thank you. And I yield to well. The gentleman has yielded the well on a simple bill. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is not in the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is not in the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? All members voted if so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill. The a's were 166 the nays were zero the bill having received the requisite constitution constitutional majority is therefore passed. For what purpose does out it representative Adesonio rise? Thank you. I'm speaking parliamentary inquiry. Thank you. Senator inquiry. Is it true that while this is a good bill it is important for everybody here to know that the alternative investment is precisely into a real estate AEW. They are primarily invest in a real estate. It's important for everybody to know. The chair is sure that the gentleman knows that of which he speaks. The clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 84. Senate Bill 84. Senate Bill 84 by Senator Hustler, the 52nd to be titled an act to amend chapter 5, a title 10 of the EFISCO to Georgia annotated the Georgia Uniform Security Act of 2008. So it's required for financial protections for elder and disabled adults who may be victims of financial exploitation. This bill ever referred to the committee on banks and banking, that committee recommends that this bill do pass. We are on the supplemental calendar. Dispure everyone's reference and the chair recognizes representative Barrett to present the bill. Thank you, Madam Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen. Senate Bill 84 updates the Georgia Uniform Security Act of 2008. It helps protect disabled and elderly adults from financial exploitation. The U.S. Department of Justice says that 10% of elderly adults are exploited every single year. This bill relates specifically to investment advisors and financial planners, which are regulated by the securities division of the Secretary of State. It allows investment advisors to place temporary holds on suspicious transactions when elder financial abuse is suspected, and prescribed rules for reporting and investigating and provide civil and administrative liability protections to them. This is commonly referred to as a report and hold law. This excellent legislation was authored by Senator Chuck Huffstettler and has overwhelming bipartisan support. It was passed unanimously by the Senate on February the 16th and was approved unanimously in the House Banks and Banking Committee last week. 31 states have this type of legislation already. This bill is supported by the Financial Services Institute, which has worked with multiple states and craft in their legislation, and is also supported by the Georgia Council on Aging, which has stated that Georgia has a strong tradition of protecting elders from abuse, and they see this bill as another important step in protecting older adults. I'll be happy to answer any questions for you if you have any. Chair recognizes representative Roberts for a question.

The time period involved in medical information that comes down in cases involving dependency and involving parental rights have been shortened because honestly the medical information that is more timely is going to be more accurate when it's more current.
