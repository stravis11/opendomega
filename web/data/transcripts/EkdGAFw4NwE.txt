This House will come back to order, House will come back to order.
Mr. Clark, would you ring the bell, please?
The clerk will read the caption to a group of privileged resolutions.
Clerk will read encouraging all Georgians to participate in the 2020 census to ensure
a complete and accurate count, recognizing April 3rd, 2020, his community activists
day to acknowledge the unsung hero activists and their strength, selfless courage and hopeless
hopeful actions that create a positive and much improved future.
And for other purposes, that completes the reading of the Privilege Resolutions.
Is there any objection to the adoption of the Privilege Resolutions?
The chair here is none and the resolutions are adopted.
What purpose does the chairman of the rules committee rise?
Make a motion.
State your motion.
Recommit Senate Bill 316 and 336 to rules.
Chairman of the Rules Committee has moved that Senate Bill 316 and Senate Bill 336 be
recommitted to the Rules Committee as their objection.
Is their objection?
The chair here is none and those are back in the Rules Committee.
or read the caption to Senate Bill 431.
Senate Bill 431 by Senator Wilkinson
and the 50th tip is the 37th plaque
of the 8th. We're asked to the 28th and
Martin of the 9th. We titled an act
to amend Code Section 2210.
The official put a Georgia and
Senator relayed an annual performance
evaluations so as to provide for
for a definition of on-time graduation rate,
this bill haven't referred to the Committee
on Education, that committee recommends
that this bill do pass.
Chair recognizes Chairman Nix to present the bill.
But before he does, you can go ahead and go up there.
I want y'all to know that today is Chairman Nix's birthday.
Happy birthday to Chairman Randy Knicks.
So you can't ever say I didn't get you anything for your birthday.
That's right.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
As I've said so many times during the session when we're always here in the winter,
it's a cold day somewhere when we're here and I'm getting happy birthday.
So I'm not sure who is cold that, Mr. Speaker, but it's a cold day in somewhere.
Senate bill 431
This is a short bill fairly
Simple there's a complex formula, but let me tell you what it does
When students go to register to go to a school a lot of times they will go in and they will register in July and August
And a lot of those students never actually go to that school
If that school has registered those students even though they don't go in and never start there
their candidate on their graduation rate.
So what this bill does, this bill sets October 1st said
that the cohort of students that attend a school
continuously from October 1 of the calendar year,
four years prior to the calendar year,
the regular date of graduation.
That would be what was used to determine
the graduation rate for the school.
It's a better measure for the individual school.
There's a lot of tracking they have to do to track down
students who leave and who come in but this gives the individual school
itself a way to say okay this is what's happened when we get the kids here
when they're in the ninth grade and they go they stay with us and we get them
graduate and these are the percentage of those kids who graduate so it's
pretty pretty simple there if you get into all the the calculations that go into
graduation it gets a little bit more difficult but that's the simple version of
it Mr. Speaker and I'll be glad to try to answer any questions I don't think you
have any questions well thank you very much and I'll go back over and start
celebrating the rest of my birthday here with all my friends tonight on Friday
night thank you would you have it any other way is there any objection to the
The previous question being ordered, the chair here is none, the previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favourable
to the passage of the bill?
The chair here is none, the report of the committee is agreed to, shall this bill now pass?
All those in favour of the passage of Senate Bill 431 will vote aye, those opposed will
vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machines.

I'll read the caption to take my rides here.
Clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 346.
Senate Bill 346 by Senator Black on the 8th,
Berk of the 11th, Anderson of the 24th,
Harold of the 40th, and Payne of the 54th,
being a talent act to amend Article 2,
Chapter 50 of Title 43,
the Fisherhood of Georgia,
Antega relating the State Board of Veterinary Medicine.
So to increase the membership of the State Board
of Veterinary Medicine and Authorizer,
registered veterinary technician member,
this bill ever referred to the Committee
on Agriculture and Consumer Affairs.
That committee recommends that this bill do pass.
Chair recognizes representative Perkall to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and colleagues.
I bring before your consideration SB 346.
It is a veterinarian bill.
Section one adds a member to the veterinary board,
which is the vet tech.
Section two allows for the creation
of a professional health program
to monitor and rehabilitate impaired veterinarians.
It's the same program that we established for human doctors
in the 80s, this is for animal doctors.
If this bill looks familiar,
it's because it is, we actually voted this bill out last year.
past the Senate had a little misunderstanding with second floor that has been
straightened out but it's the same bill that we voted on the last time those of
you that are concerned about your voting consistency I don't know how
exactly you voted but the vote was 165 to 1 I'll let you make your own
determination on that but that is Senate bill 346 of was SB 75 I'll stand for
questions if there are any, Mr. Speaker?
Do not see any questions. Thank you.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee,

the
clerk will read the caption to
senate bill 303
senate bill 303 by senator Watson
First Jones of the 25th, Butler of the 55th,
Honourment of the 45th, Markner of the 9th, and others.
We titled an act to amend chapter 24,
Title 33, the fiscal to George Annotator,
relaying the insurance generally,
so is to provide for greater transparency
of prices for non-emergency health care services.
Ms. Bill Hammer, referred to the committee on
special committee on quality health care.
That committee recommends that this bill do pass
by committee substitute.
Chair recognizes Chairman Newton to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Colleagues, I think we've made some amazing progress along with our colleagues across
the hall on items that we think will make great protections for Georgia consumers in
particular when they have health care needs.
The work on surprise billing, while it's come far, is still being completed, but there's
There's another piece to that that consumers care about and that's the affordability of
their health care.
If care that's not affordable is not really accessible and that's why we have a committee
to look at that.
I'm excited to work with a colleague across the Hall Center of Ben Watson on Senate Bill
303.
This Senate bill will along with our approval will create a new code section that will
require insurers, remember insurers are the ones you send your money to monthly for you
and your family, to make the insurers will require to have a public accessible website
with information regarding the in-network costs for health care services and
in addition to that quality metrics. If you look at the bill the first lines 15
through 62 or largely definitions the real meat of the bill comes on line 83 and
that's where that's where the insurer that you use is required to have a
notification on their website of the actual amount that is being paid to a
particular service provider whether it's a hospital an ambulatory surgery center
and imaging center, and even more important it will require to have a calculator that
will let you calculate how much out of pocket it's going to cost you, and since cost is
not valuable unless you already know or also know the quality of the service, these websites
will take data that's being collected other places will require the insurer to right
next to the place where you have the price for a particular service.
You'll also have that hospital or maybe multiple hospital or centers quality available
to. What this would do if you needed an MRI, it might give you the possibility of looking
at several in-network options through your insurance. You could look on their website.
You could see the different in-network places. You could have this done. You would have
their quality to determine if there was any difference in quality, but you're also going
to have the price that they're paid and also the amount that's going to be out of pocket
for you. That could be true of a new replacement. You could compare it being done in a hospital
or an ambulatory surgery center, it could be done and you could have an imaging center
or a hospital-based radiologic procedure or maybe multiple hospitals that you have in
your network would be available to show you how much it's going to cost at the different
places and then it would let you as a consumer start to shop to actually look at quality
and price together in an easily accessible transparent website.
We think this is going to start with the commissioner, the department will make decisions about
what procedures are appropriate for this and we'll expand it as much as possible.
These are elective emergencies and complications obviously involve things that someone can't
always give you a price up front for but there's so many things in health care where you
can look and if you can find price and quality and it's right there with the insurance plan
that you have, you'll be able to make a more informed decision and I think we can move
to a more affordable health care as well as this message and this information becomes
more capable and more accessible. So with that Mr. Speaker, I'd be glad to answer any
questions regarding Senate Bill 303.
You do not appear to have any questions.
With that, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the consideration
and hopefully favorable consideration,
and I yield the well.
Is, I'm sorry, there is a question.
My bad, I didn't see you trying to be recognized.
Chair recognizes representative Davis, that's you,
and, okay.
Now, Jack and Clark.
Huh?
Representative Jack and Clark.
certainly just curious you said that the insurance company is going to have to tell you the
quality.
I'm just and you said it was going to come from all these different places.
What entity decides the quality of a different one facility versus another facility?
Who's the deciding entity that gives each facility at a fair rating?
That's a great question, and I thank the lady for that.
The quality, a lot of these metrics are admission rates
along with re-admission rates or complication rates.
Those are already being gathered by the facilities,
so we're not trying to add new regulations
or new burdens to some of our overburdened hospitals,
but a lot of these are being reported already
either to CMS or healthgrades or healthcare.gov.
What this will do is will allow the insurer
to get that information from the hospital
that's already been an in-network hospital
that they have an agreement with.
That's how they're in-network.
And then it will allow them to pull that information
that's already being gathered.
And as we gather more quality information,
I'm sure it will expand.
But this is publicly available already.
This will just put it in a way where the consumer
can get to it without having to know
how to navigate multiple different government
and non-governmental agency websites.
It'll put it on the website for your particular insurance
plan for the network that you're in, so it'll give you the real cost for you, and it'll
also have next to that the quality for the different facilities that you might be able
to choose from.
And does it only for the yield?
Certainly.
Will that quality be in the form of stars, check marks, or is there going to be a number
system?
I got a 10.
How is it expected for this information to be delivered to the public as they're shopping?
There is a current federal, if you look on line 65, in particular there's a hierarchical
condition, category methodology, all capitalized.
It's something that CMS is gathering now.
It's well vetted to make sure it allows for fairness between a facility that say has a
high number of hypertensive or diabetic patients versus another one that has very few.
So it risks, risk adjusts that data so that you really compare in apples to apples.
They're not unfavorably comparing one that takes higher risk individuals comparing with
someone who takes really low risk individuals.
So by using that hierarchical condition, category methodology through CMS right now, it will
allow that you get really true risk adjusted, not just patient selection bias, but you'll
get risk adjusted quality data.
That's a great question.
All right.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
If there are no other questions, Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the will.
I don't see any further questions.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
The chair here is none.

Mr. Clerk, you may lock the machine on the passage of Senate Bill 303.
The eyes are 128, the nays are 7.
This bill having received their requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed.
Clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 462.
bill 462 by center, Ken of the 18th,
go to the 51st, Duke in the 30th, Jones in the 25th,
Mulles in the 53rd.
To be titled an act to amend,
title seven of the official go to Georgia,
annotated relating to banks and finance.
So it's to transfer duties, powers, responsibilities,
and other authority relative to industrial loans
from the industrial loan commissioner
to the Department of Banking and Finance.
This bill I refer to the committee on banks
and banking that committee recommends
this bill do pass by committee substitute.
Chair recognizes representative Williamson to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Members of the House, I'm here today to present Senate Bill 462, the House Committee substitute LC500109S.
Quite simply, this Senate bill passes Senate 54 to nothing.
The only reason it's a committee substitute is the effective date.
For budgetary reasons, we're sitting July 1, 2020.
It transfers the Georgia Industrial Loan Act from the Department of Insurance to where
it should have been more appropriately administered on the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance.
It was vetted twice through the insurance committee and came out without objection unanimously.
Quite simply, it's going to offer operational efficiencies to the regulated companies in a very professional manner by the George Department of Banking and Finance and at the same time as some saved Georgia taxpayers according to the Department of Audits about $190,000 a year.
And seriously, quite simply, that's all it does.
moves, done change in terms of conditions of the products,
moves it from one regulating entity to another,
invest in my knowledge,
dorge's the only state where the department of insurance
regulates financial services industry such as this one.
Be happy to answer any questions, otherwise I ask
for your favorable consideration and yield the well.
I do not see any questions.
I yield the well.

This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed.
We'll read the caption to Senate Bill 358.
Senate Bill 358 by Senator Harper, the seventh,
It assumes the 12th Burke of the 11th Walker of the 20th
Black of the 8th and others to be a total of an act to amend
Article 3, Chapter 3, and Title 50, the official go to
Georgia annotated relating to state symbols.
So as to designate the Muscatine grape as the official state
grape, this bill ever referred to the committee on agriculture
and consumer affairs, that committee recommends that this bill
do pass.
You
Chair recognizes representative Perkel to present Senate Bill 358.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker of Senate Bill 358. In six weeks, we will begin the harvest of the muskidines, the state of Georgia produces
more muskidines than anyone in the world. We are the leading producer. We have the largest muskidine orchard in the world in
Irwin County
near
between Lacks and Ray
in
Irwin County is
between
7 and 850 acres in an orchard down there and I was asked earlier if I can
knew the difference between a muskidine and a scuppinine. It turns out the
scuppinine is a variety of muskidine. This will be interesting to one of our
members Chairman Hogan in the top who likes great trivia. It was first found
along the Scuppernon River in Northeastern North Carolina.
It's a variety.
We produce more.
We have the largest and oldest
muskidine breeding program in the world
at the University of Georgia.
And it's only proper
that this be the muskidine designated
as the official Georgia grade.
