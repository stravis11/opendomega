The Coopers love serving the Lord
together and spending time with friends
and family and also watching the Georgia
Bulldogs. Thank you very much.
>> Thank you, Senator Watson. I appreciate
it. Thank you, Mr. President, for the
opportunity. I'm glad to be able to be
here and I'm thankful that my family can
be here. I was here a couple of years
ago and uh my wife came along and uh
it's always good when she comes along.
She helps keep me in line and but I'm
glad that my children can be here today.
Uh my greatest joy outside of Jesus is
my family and I thank the Lord for them.
I think what you all do in this room has
a great impact on families.
I spoke a couple of years ago in this
room on the subject of beginning with
God because it all ends with God. Today
I want to look in the book of Psalms
where the Bible gives us this passage
chapter 14 or Psalm 14. The Bible says,
"The fool hath said in his heart, there
is no God. They are corrupt. They have
done abominable works. There is none
that doeth good. The Lord looked down
from heaven upon the children of men to
see if there were any that did
understand and seek God." The Bible says
in verse number two of this passage that
the Lord looked down from heaven upon
the children of men at the conclusion of
the verse to see if there were any that
seek God. I have been pastoring the
church that my dad pastored for 34
years. I have been pastoring it for the
last 10 years. And there have been many
times throughout the last 10 years that
I have said to myself, uh, how many
times has my dad looked over heaven and
seen what I am doing or what we're
doing? And I wonder if he's proud. I
wonder if he recognizes. I wonder if
he's able to see. People ask me, do you
think they can see what's going on? The
Bible tells us, we're compassed about
with so great a cloud of witnesses. Let
us lay aside the sin that does so easily
beset us. Let us run with patience the
race that is set before us. And I'm sure
there are many in this room that have
loved ones who have gone on before them
and they said to themselves, "I wonder
if they look over heaven what they see."
May I encourage you with this thought
this morning? There is one that looks
over heaven and his name is God. The
Bible says he looked down from heaven.
And my question to us this morning is
when God looks down, what does he see?
When the Lord looks into this room, when
the Lord looks at the direction of our
state, the leadership, uh the agendas
that are being promoted, when God looks
down, is he pleased?
It's easy to look at that corporately
and say it's important, it's vital. But
that begins with us understanding as an
individual, we have a responsibility to
please God first.
In all things, the Bible says, he might
have the preeminence. Whenever you begin
to put pen to paper, whenever you begin
to stand and address the issues that are
put forth in this room, may you know
this truth that God is looking down.
The Bible teaches us that every man will
give an account of himself. Every person
in this room will stand before God with
the opportunity that they've been given.
And you have to answer to one. It's not
the preacher.
It is God.
He's looking down today.
And every thought, every action, every
deed, every word,
every step in our life, we ought to
consider God is watching. The Bible
tells us this, that the eyes of the Lord
are in every place, beholding the evil
and the good. God sees it all. I had an
older pastor explain to me that verse
one time. He said, you know, when God
looks at your life, we we view our life
by moments.
But when God looks at our life, he sees
it as a picture that is painted on a
canvas complete. He sees it the
beginning from the end. He sees all the
details. And today, he is watching. He's
watching what we do in this room. May
God help us to do our best for his
glory.
The greatest thing in my life that I can
tell you about me is that I as a
13-year-old boy, I understood that God
loved me. There's no perfect people in
this room.
And God loves imperfect people. And he
sent a perfect son to die on a cross
that we might be redeemed.
Jesus said to those that were confused
about where he was going, he said, "I am
the way, the truth, and the life. No man
cometh unto the father but by me. You
must know Jesus as your savior.
I understood as a 13-year-old boy that
if I died without Jesus Christ, I had to
be separated from him for all eternity.
But Jesus made a way. He made a way on a
cross when he died and shed his blood
for your sin and for my sin. And that,
my friend, demands that we consider
him.
God look down from heaven.
And my question to you this morning is
as he looks, what does he see in this
place? I pray I pray that each one of us
understand the responsibility we have
before God.
As I close in prayer this morning, I
want to say to each of you, our church
prays for you.
We are grateful for the leadership in
our state. We are grateful for each of
your services.
Your willingness to be a public servant
is an example, and we're thankful for
that.
I appreciate your willingness to help
our state be what it should be. Thank
you for the opportunity to be here.
Let's pray together, may we?
Our Father, I do thank you today for
your love, for your grace, and for your
mercy. I thank you for giving us another
day of life. I thank you for blessing us
beyond what we deserve. Lord, you are
good.
So Lord, I pray today as we bow our
heads, I ask for wisdom. I pray that
you'd grant every individual in this
room the strength and the courage and
the wisdom to do what is right. May we
understand, Lord, that you are looking
down from heaven and we have a
responsibility
to be pleasing to you. May we allow the
word of God to guide the principles of
our life. May the steps of every person
be ordered by the Lord in this place.
May you protect. May you grant wisdom,
strength, and Lord, we say to each
public servant this morning, thank you
for your willingness to serve. We thank
you for our state. Bless it. Grant us
prosperity and strength. May we be an
example to all those around us. And we
will give you the glory for it because
God, you alone are worthy. We ask this
in Jesus precious name. Amen.
Good job.
We have a very special guest here today.
We have doctor of the day,
but the doctor of today is uh has a
unique tie to this body right here. So,
uh, I'll let the senator from the 19th
who's introducing her today explain that
to everyone. So, Senator,
>> thank you, Mr. President. As you know,
we have a doctor of the day every
legislative session day here, and today
we have one back from my district. I've
met her once. The uh uh doctor of the
day is Dr. Ashley Nicole Tillery. She's
here today. She's an OBGYn
delivering her group delivers around a
thousand babies down in Videlia, Georgia
each year. She has clinics in Vidilia
and in Hazelhurst. She studied at NIH,
studied at the Medical College of
Georgia, uh was in the partnership at
the University of Georgia where she met
the love of her life.
Thank you. Thank you. And made her best
decision ever at that point in time. Uh
but let me tell you about the other
things she does, too. She's on the
library board back in our home county
because she understands that literacy
matters. She takes care of our boys all
day, every day. John and William, 20
months old and four years old. She takes
care of Jeremiah who's sitting there in
the back while that allows me to be up
here and she's more than just a
physician. She's someone who cares about
our community and she's absolute love of
my life. So, baby, thank you for being
our doctor of the day.
>> All right.
>> Oh, thank you. Thank you guys so much
for having me today. I just want to tell
all of you, thank you. I know that
coming to do this job, you take a lot of
time away from your own families, your
communities, and your careers as well.
So I certainly appreciate the work that
you come um to the capitol to do for all
Georgians and because of the work you do
the future of medicine in the state of
Georgia is incredibly bright. So thank
you guys so much.
>> All right.
We have some very special guests here
today and uh glad we're able to
recognize these fine ladies here behind
us. Secretary, read the caption, please.
>> Senator Resolution 648 by Senators
Anderson of the 43rd and others. A
resolution recognizing and commending
the Junior League movement on the
occasion of its 125th anniversary and
honoring its enduring legacy of
developing women leaders and
strengthening communities through
volunteer service, civic engagement and
advocacy and for other purposes. Whereas
for 125 years, the Junior League
movement has advanced women's leadership
for meaningful community impact through
volunteer action, collaboration, and
leadership development. And whereas the
Association of Junior Leagues
International
supports a global network of nearly 300
local leads across multiple countries
mobilizing more than 112,000 women
committed to strengthening communities
through service and leadership. Now
therefore, be it resolved by the Senate

The committees of the Senate on
regulated industries and utilities
recommends that this do pass by
substitute by Senator Cowzer of the 46
and chairman.
Mr. Mr. President, the Senate Committee
on Regulated Industries and Utilities
offers the following substitute to
Senate Bill 146, a bill to be entitled
and act to amend titles 31, 36, and 44
of the Official Code of Georgia
annotated relating to health, local
government, and property, respectively,
so as to provide regulations and
protections of cemeteries and burial
grounds, to revise procedures concerning

concerning the issuance of permits for
the disturbance of abandoned cemeteries,
to provide civil remedies for failures
to obtain such permits. to provide for
the insurance of permits for permits for
the establishment of family burial plots
to provide minimum requirements of
family burial plots and for other
purposes. Mr. President, that completes
the order.
Recognize Senator from the 25th to speak
to the measure.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Ladies and gentlemen, come before you
with uh Senate Bill 146. This bill
codifies what cemeteries are and how
they're to be treated. Defines what
abandoned cemeteries are. And it also
prevents disturbance of cemeteries. And
uh this is something that u would also
define what an abandoned cemetery is.
But it sets out something that's uniform
throughout the state for rural counties
where people are trying to set up a
cemetery on their property. They cannot
sell these spaces. This would be for a
family only if it was um cemetery spaces
for sale. Then they would register under
the Secretary of State's office through
securityurities division to form a
perpetual care cemetery. I ask for your
favorable consideration and I'll be glad
to take any questions if there is any.
Mr. President,
>> you do have one question, Senator.
Recognize Senator from the 37th.
>> Yes, sir.
>> Does Jim yield?
>> I do. I I appreciate your short
presentation. I was um just wanted to
ask just kind of in plain language, if
you're if if a church is running a small
cemetery, what thing what provisions
this bill change the status quo of our
law today? That that that was my only
question.
>> I'm having trouble hearing you. I'm
sorry. U but I think you're referring to
a church cemetery. This would not affect
a church cemetery unless it became
abandoned. Okay. And then they would
give definition of an abandoned cemetery
and how it is treated and how it is
classified.
>> But this in no way changes the the the
rights, responsibilities, duties, legal
status of church cemeteries in any way.
Correct.
>> Right.
>> Thanks, sir.
>> Uhhuh. Thank you.
I ask for your favorable consideration.
Thank you, and I yield away.
>> Senator has yielded. Does any other
senator wish to speak for against the
measure? Chair hears none. Is there
objection to the previous question being
ordered? Chair hears none. The previous
question is ordered. Question is on the
adoption of the committee substitute. Is
there objection to the adoption of the
committee substitute? Hearing? None. The
committee substitute is adopted. Is
there objection to the main question
being ordered? Chair hears none. Main
question is ordered. Questions on the
passes of the bill by substitute. All

>> Thank you, Mr. President.
I'm here today to present Senate Bill
150 and it's return to work bill for uh
for teachers. Um, this bill will pass
our Senate Education Committee 100%.
Why is this bill important? If we don't

determines the quality and size of
future workforces.
I am sure that every senator has
received a phone call or a text from a
retired teacher or soon to be retired
teacher concerning this bill.
This bill is ex This bill we currently
on a bill that expires House Bill 385
that expire June 30th to 26. We worked
very diligently and hard with the uh Dr.
Jody Barrow with professional standards
commission and um the TRS executive
director retired Buster Evans and now
Jason Branch on this bill.
You listened and we reacted. The Senate
identified literacy or illiteracy as a
real problem in Georgia when we shared
with you the percentage of students in
third and fifth grade in your Senate
district that were not reading on grade
level.
We heard you. Y'all reacted and we've
got numerous bills addressing that per
per Dr. Jod Jod Barrett, executive
director of Professional Standards
Commission. Number of classrooms in
Georgia that do not have a fully
prepared
certified educator in the classroom. And
let me read them all to you. In December
of 23, there were over 6,000 vacancies
in Georgia. In December 24, 5,300
vacancies in Georgia. in December 25,
5,358
vacancies. And yes, one of our senators,
our education committee said, asked me a
question. Could we tell him what
district that related to or what school
district? And yes, we can. Professional
standards are working on those numbers
for me. So, you can tell we've got a
real tragedy in Georgia for not having
not having fully um certified teachers
in classroom. Let me give you a personal
example that I can I can share with you.
Evans County, which is one of my
counties in my district, classing
elementary school per Dr. Brad Anderson
on September 1st of 2025.
There was six classes
in K through K through five without a
fully prepared certified educator in the
classroom.
Kindergarten have one class. First grade
had one class. Second grade had one
class. Third grade had two classes and
fifth grade had one class. The tragedy
that's a tragedy itself because the high
the highest degree person in that
classroom was a high had a high school
diploma. According to Dr. Anderson.
As of January 26th, 2026, still at
Claxton Elementary School in Clon,
Georgia, there were three vacancies out
of those six that had not been filled.
Now, Senator, let me ask you this.
How would you like your child or
grandchild
to be in one of those classrooms that
does not have a fully prepared or
certified teacher? Do you think your
child or grandchild when they move to
the next grade level is going to be
fully prepared for that? No, they're
not. That's the purpose of this bill.
We've got to address that problem. And I
tell you in just a second, this bill's
got a sunset in it. And we're working
very close with the college and
universities in Georgia to make sure
that they're going they are teaching on
the science of reading and they're
teaching our students how to be teachers
that teach our students.
Let me tell you the key provisions of
this bill.
TRS, teacher retirement system in
Georgia, tells me now that the average
person retires in the school system at
25 years. Now, that doesn't mean that
they get full retirement. They do not.
As some of our senators have asked me,
they really don't get full retirement
till 30 years, but because of wanting to
get out, maybe maybe raising children or
something like that. Who knows? But the
average retirement now is people is at
25 years. So this this bill a teacher
can return to work after teaching 25
years and retiring. But now there's a
one-year waiting period. They have to
stay out of it. Stay out of school for
one year. However, they can come back
and do that 49% that all of us are aware
of. Okay? So they will receive their
retirement and receive the salary for
teaching in the classroom.
Let me let me stop there and read to you
something I forgot. But so this this
letter this email came from of Miss
Robin Thompson and I don't know where
she lives but she said, "I'm writing to
express my concern my express my strong
support to Georgia Senate Bill 150. As a
veteran educator, I see firsthand the
severe teacher shortage facing Georgia.
With more than 5,000 teaching vacancies
statewide, districts are struggling to
staff classrooms. In my own county,
schools have been forced to hire
teachers from other countries to fill
the gap. While we value all educators,
this has created challenges for students
due to language barriers and differences
in instructional experience, especially
at the elementary level.
So, this bill only applies to the public
school system and applies to K through
12. Let me tell you the courses that
that these teachers can come back and
teach, which is
very important ELA, English language
arts, science, social studies, special
education, and math. And now we've added
career technical agricultural education,
CTAE, which the senator from the ETH has
asked us several questions about and
very exciting because his wife is head
of that in their school system.
>> Hey, Senator, hold on one second. Ladies
and gentlemen in the chamber, we're
going to have to bring it down a notch.
We can't hear. If you got to have
conversation, go to the Annie room
if you're a senator.
>> So, we need to pay get the attention to
the senator in the whale, please.
But in order to come back, if they're
teaching English language arts or an
academic content, they've got to have a
current uh dyslexia
or reading endorsement or they can
demonstrate specific training and skills
in the science reading and approved by
the professional standards commission.
Many of y'all y'all have asked me what's
the cost of this. These teachers are
replacing teachers that are no longer
there. So there is no cost to the TRS
system. We had actual real study done.
There's no cost to it to the system. We
also know that if this bill works the
way that we want it to work and the
college and universities are doing what
they need to do, we've got a sunset in
this bill of June the 30th of 2034. And
hopefully by that time we would we would
have made a tremendous dent on these on
having teachers in classroom. So by that
time we should have solved the teacher
teacher shortage problem.
So senators, I would really I think our
students our students and across rural
Georgia would really appreciate you
voting for this bill. And um Mr.
President, at that point point in time,
I'll take any questions. Yes, sir. Yes,
sir.
>> You do have a few questions. Senator,
recognize the senator from the 33rd for
a question. No question. Recognize
Senator from the 26 for a question.
Thank.
>> Oh, that was bad. You You don't have to
tell me.
>> Thank you, Mr. President. Gentlemen,
here.
>> Yes, sir. I do.
Are you telling me
that if the school system
has a vacancy
for a particular teacher
that they can't get a retired teacher to
go in who's certified
to teach that class? I thought it had
something to do with TRA.
They don't have to school system don't
have to pay money into the retirement
system for but they pay them. Are you
telling me they can't do that? Now what
I'm telling you Sandra is that that
teacher can come back but that teacher
comes back at a 49%.
And can so they teach less than halfime
and as opposed to this bill allows them
to come back full time.
>> So you saying they can't come in and be
hired as fulltime? Sir,
>> are you saying that they cannot be hired
as full-time teachers after they retired
by at in the system?
>> No, sir. Under the current law, they
cannot be hired as a full-time teacher.
They've got to be hired at 49%.
>> And that that's what the importance of
this bill is. And again, people, this
this bill has a sunset provision that if
we get it all worked out and y'all
support this bill, that the college and
universities are working very hard. If
you recall the Council on Literacy and
and House Bill 538 brought back the
science of reading into the classroom
and consequently we're working very
close with the college university to get
to make it more attractable and you'll
see several more bills in the ne next
few days addressing teacher shortage in
Georgia.
You have a question from Senator from
19th.
He wants to speak at the well.
Senator from the 21st.
Senator from the 21st.
Is this our new senator that's absent
right now? Senator.
>> Oh, he's gone.
>> Yeah. I hope his I hope his town in here
today,
>> Mr. President, I'm going to yield. Well,
>> all right. Sounds good.
>> Thank you, sir.
>> Thank you.
>> Senator from 39th. What point? Senator
from the 39th. What purpose do you rise?
This is a point in time to do it.
>> You want to recognize your friends?
>> Yes. I
thank you, Mr. President. This is
completely unrelated to SB150, but I
just wanted to acknowledge a couple of
people in the gallery from Jack and Jill
of America who were here. And that is an
organization, a mother's organization
particularly for black children that was
started in 1938. I am a member of the
organization myself. the only active
Jack and Jill mom in the entire general
assembly. And we've got ch lots of young
people here who are learning what it
means to have their government work,
including my page, Bryce Blake. Thank
you.
>> Everybody with Jack and Jill, stand up
and be recognized. Give yourself a round
of applause. So,
so very nice to have all those
wonderful, wonderful young people and
their mentors and thank you Senator for
recognizing them. So,
recognize Senator from 19 speak to the
bill.
We'll get you We'll get you in a second.
We'll get you in a second.
>> Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the
Senate, Senate Bill 150, let's talk
about it for a second. It allows someone
to retire after 25 years of service, and
they can come back and work full-time.
That means if you started working at 22,
you're going to be able to retire at 47,
draw your retirement at whatever the
early number that would be, and then
still come back and work full-time. I am
focused with you on trying to alleviate
the issue we have with not having
teachers in the classroom. I purport to
you though I don't know that this helps
if it doesn't instead cause a an issue
where we actually lead people to retire
earlier. And if they do, we need to be
able to address this in the future. So I
just want to put a flag on this point.
I'm I'm willing to walk with you today
and try this point. But I also want to
say that if we come back in two years,
three years, four years, and we realize
that folks are retiring at 25 and
creating and making that situation
worse, we we need to be willing to
readress that. Then the other point I
want to bring up is this. We have
several buckets of retirees. Teachers
fall into TRS. Employees fall into ERS.
TRS requires a 3% raise on retirement
every single year. ERS does not. So when
we take and allow another benefit that
that is for one program TRS while it may
be good naturatured and it may be good
in the end I want to show you and remind
you that we're further causing the wedge
and divide to develop between our
employees who fall into the bucket of
ERS who are not guaranteed that 3% every
year on retirement. Well, I'm willing to
go with this with you today and I trust
that the senator from the fourth and I
know he's done a really good job on this
this work. If I'm not here in a few
years, and you are, I hope we will
revisit this and make sure it's having
the intended consequence and not further
um causing the divide not only between
teachers in the classroom but also
between our two systems. Thank you, Mr.
President. I'll yield for questions or
yield the well.
>> You do have one question, Senator.
Recognize Senator from 36.
>> Thank you, Mr. President. This is
Senator Yield.
>> Yes, ma'am.
>> Um, isn't it true you you mentioned the
employee retirement system? We're
getting a little feedback on the mic,
but you you mentioned, isn't it true,
the employee the uh retirement system
for the non teaching,
>> right,
>> uh state employees and the fact that it
was the act of the legislature and the
I in in removing the 3% cost of living
from a long established practice for
those employees. Isn't that true?
>> It I don't know. I don't think it was
legislation that did that, Senator. It
is legislation that created the 3% raise
for TRS though and if it was legislation
that removed it, it also would have been
legislative that created it. Well, but
would you agree if he further you for
further questions that it was it was the
the result uh of decisions made uh in
the uh in uh the wake of the great
recession that state employee retirees
do have not gotten a cost of living a 3%
cost of living in 17 years. You would
agree with that. Is that right?
>> That that's not fact. They have received
a cost of living increase, but you are
correct
>> 3% cost of living was what I expect.
>> You are correct that they've not
received the cost of living increase
that is received in the TRS program,
which is why we may even actually be
saying the same thing here. We're that
divide becomes worse when we continue to
pivot to one group over the other of
state employees.
>> Uh thank you for the flags you've
raised. Uh it's it's true, I believe,
that we passed this unanimously in our
committee. Isn't that right? Uh I'm not
on that committee, but you may had.
>> Thank you for uh yielding.
>> You do have one more question. Senator
recognized Senator from the 27th.
>> Thank you, Mr. President. Chairman, do
you yield?
>> Yes, sir.
>> Can you walk me through as you
understand the bill? Essentially, are we
creating an incentive
unintentionally here to to allow people
to retire at 25, year 25, come back at
year 27, essentially double dip in the
system? Well, the Senator, we may and
that's what I'm highlighting for our
colleagues is that I realize we have a
situation with shortages in the
classroom. So, I'm willing to support
this and move forward, but I want
someone to put a flag in it, put a pin
in it so that we evaluate it in two
years, three years, whatever the time
frame needs to be because if we've not
closed that gap, if we've actually
unintentionally made that gap worse, we
need to realize what code section we
changed when we did that.
>> Do you further yield?
>> Yes, sir. Would it, in your opinion,
would it be a good idea for our friend,
the bill sponsor, to perhaps uh when
this goes to the House to put some
reporting language in here uh that
reports back to the future chairman of
the House Education Committee so we can
keep an eye on that
>> if if that's needed. I clearly every
senator here in this body can bring an
amendment, too. But again, I want to
highlight that for our colleagues that
we don't want to make this worse and we
also don't want to make the divide
between our ERS system and our TRS
system uh more uh the chasm's there
enough that we need to make it deeper.
>> You do have one more question, Senator.
Recognize Senator from 46.
>> Thank you, Mr. President. Senator,
yield.
>> Yes, sir. In your role as appropriations
chairman, have you given any thought to
what impact this might have on the
actuarial soundness of the teacher
retirement system if new teachers begin
retiring earlier in drawing their
retirement? Is that something we've
accounted for or is that a potential
hole we're about to blow in their
retirement system?
>> Well, the there's actually if you look
on the back there's an auditor
certification that this does not affect
the TRS system as it's drafted right
now. My point to you would be let's
watch that because we also were told
that one tax credit we passed several
years ago would cost the state 37
million and it's now costing over 700
million. That's the data center tax
credit. So while we have this data that
we're working with the best information
we have today for those of you in this
room who plan to be here longer we need
to flag this and watch it for the future
just to make sure we're having the
intended result.
>> Thank you Mr. Chairman.
>> Mr. President, thank you for all the
questions. I'll yield the well.
Senators yielded.
>> Does any other senator wish to speak for
against measure?
Senator from the fourth, would you like
to close or you wave?
Come on.
Thank you all. Thank y'all for the
questions all on on the bill. One thing
that
came up about the u the cost and all
every on finance committee every every
bill that we have has a fiscal note and
all we have to go by is what that fiscal
note says. And we received a fiscal note
on this bill, Senate Bill 150. And the
fiscal note said it was no cost, zero
cost to the TRS system. Now, we can't we
can't say 10 years from now what the
cost is, but but the people that we rely
on for the fiscal notes said there's no
cost to the TRS system on this. Also,
think about this too. If you're in the
military, and I think some of y'all may
may have have, there's different levels
of retirement in that. So, just don't
hold it against people just because
they're retiring at 25. They're already
the average average average retirement
age of a person in Georgia teaching is
for 25 years. Thank you. Please vote yes
on this bill. Vote for our students so
we'll have qualified teachers in the
classroom teaching our students how to
read and how to do math and how to
understand social studies and how to
understand the civics system of the
world. Thank you. I yield a word.
>> All right. Senator has yielded.
Does any other senator wish to speak for
against the measure? Hold on, Senator.
I'm I'm gonna get to you. I promise you.
Senator from the 41st, you have
something on on this topic.
>> Unanimous consent. I'm ask for unanimous
consent to excuse the senator from the
22nd.
>> Okay. Without objection, senator from
22nd excused.
Chair hears none. Is there objection to
the previous question being ordered?
Chair hears none. Previous question is
ordered. Questions on the adoption of
the committee substitute. Is there
objection to the adoption of the
committee substitute? Hearing none, the
committee substitute is adopted. Is
there objection to agreeing to the
reported committee which is favorable to
the passes of the bill? The chair hears
none. The reported committee is agreed
to. Is there objections to the main
question being ordered? Chair hears
none. The main question is ordered.
Questions on the passes of the bill by
substitute. All those in favor vote yay.
All oppose? Nay. Secretary unlock the
machine.
On the pass of the bill, the A's are 48.
The N's are one. This bill having
received direct constitutional majority
is therefore passed by substitute.
I'm going out of order a little bit, but
that's what you do for your hometown
folks here. So, uh, behind me I have
Jackson. is today here at the capital we
have Jackson Butts County Day and I've
got the leadership from the city of
Jackson from city councilman Don Cook to
Mike the county commissioner Mike Wilson
to Rick you not I'm kidding he
represents him well to to uh
commissioner Russ Crumbley our mayor
Carlos Duffy and then the commissioner
uh Joe Brown and uh and Brad Brad
Johnson here is our county manager
And uh and and I just want to tell you,
oh chief, too. I'm sorry, chief. Uh so
I'm sorry. In fact, our mayor here,
Carlos, right here, when we were growing
up, his nickname was Scoot. So I had to
say, well, I can't call you Scoot
anymore. I got to call you the I got to
call you Carlos here. So, but uh at any
rate, this we've got great leadership uh
at the local level at Jackson and Buds
County there, and they work very well
together. Very proud to be there. I I'm
a sixth generation Buzz County and I
will just sh tell you this uh these guys
right here because of their how how much
they've worked together in the very near
future Buds County is going to be the
first and only county that has zero
homestead exemption taxes on property.
Zero on property. I don't know I don't
know where y'all from, but where I'm
from, everybody's jumping up and down
about that. So, uh, but so I want to
thank them for their leadership. Let's
give them a big round of applause here.
Now recognize senators from 17th. For
what purpose do you rise?
>> Mr. President,
I rise today. Point of order, Mr.
President. I rise today to recognize the
great city of Macdonald upon our first
annual Macdonald day at the Georgia
State Capitol and we're delighted to
have them here in the Georgia State
Senate. Let's give them a big hand.
The city of Mc Thank you. The city at
Macdonald was founded in 1823
and named for a naval officer commandor
Thomas Macdonald.
Since it in incorporation, the city of
Macdonald has embodied the principles of
local self-governance, civic engagement,
and responsible stewardship reflecting
the determination and vision of the
citizens. And the success of the city of
Macdonald is due in large measure to the
dedicated service of its mayor, city
council, past and present, city staff,
volunteers, business leaders, and
engaged residents who have worked
collectively to advance the city's
growth and prosperity. And we have them
with us today, if you'll raise your
hand. And standing with me is the
senator from the 42nd and the senator
from the 10th.
Uh, and we have with us the mayor, Mayor
Vana, please raise your hand.
Council members Blue, Bert, Thomas,
Payton, and Reeds. Would you all raise
your hand so they can see the wonderful
city of Mcdana, Georgia?
Thank you, Mr. President.
Thank you, Senator. And uh good to see
the leadership of Mcdana here. Y'all my
neighbors down in middle Georgia. And uh
glad to have the new mayor and the city
council members here as well. So uh
great to have you and uh look forward to
working with you guys all. All right.
Thank you, Senator. And this brings me
to my second point. Always be here for
the points of personal privilege.
All right. Here we go.
Secretary, read the caption.
>> Senate Bill 411 by Senator Still of the
48th and others. A bill to be entitled
an act to amend article to amend title
43 of the official code of Georgia
annotated relating to professions and
businesses so as to provide for dry
needling to be performed by certain
licensed individuals. To provide for
definitions to restrict certain
representations and advertisements
related to the performance of dry
needling. To provide for education and
training requirements for occupational
therapists to perform dry needling. To
provide for disciplinary action. To
provide for training requirements for
acupuncturists. To provide for related
matters to provide for an effective date
to repeal conflicting laws and for other
purposes.
Mr. President, a Senate Committee on
Health and Human Services offers the
following substitute to Senate Bill 411.
A bill to be entitled an act to amend
title 43 of the official code of Georgia
annotated relating to professions and
businesses to to provide for dried
needling to be performed by certain
licensed professionals to provide for
definitions to restrict certain
representations advertisements relate to
the performance of dried needling and
for other purposes. Mr. President, that
completes the order.
All right, let's uh uh Mr. Doorkeeper,
secure the secure the chamber right now
except for people going out for a second
cuz it's getting a little loud in here
and we just have one more bill to go and
and then we'll be done. But we do need
to give the senators their due attention
when they're in the whale. So I
recognize a senator from the 48th to
speak to the measure.
>> Thank you, Mr. President.
This will likely not be the most
controversial bill that we discuss this
legislative session, but it is
critically important to a small group of
practitioners
in the healthc care field, specifically
the differences between dry needling and
acupuncture.
Uh, recently the senator from the 13th
asked if this was a sticky bill, and I
would say uh that in some respects it
certainly is. or as the senator from the
29th said, "Is this the same as when I
was stabbed by an icepick?" And I would
say no. This is not quite the same as
being stabbed by an ice pick. Um
although depending on whether or not uh
the current
Mrs. Robertson did that or not is up for
debate. Uh but this bill brings PTS and
OT's on the same page in the act of dry
needling. It clarifies language on the
difference between dry needling practice
and acupuncture and traditional Chinese
medicine.
It allows, if you'll look at the, uh,
the green document, the substitute lines
38 through 40, uh, discusses private
cause of action that was put in there
with the input of some friends that
wanted to make sure that we had
clarifying language there. And I believe
that this after many many months of
compromised language and all these
different groups and uh being given the
final approval by the George Medical
Association ensures that our physicians,
our physical therapists, our
occupational therapists and our
acupuncturists are all on the same page
and understand who does what by how much
training and what they have to do. And
with that, I'm happy to answer any
questions.
You do have a couple questions, Senator.
Recognize Senator from the 41st.
>> Thank you, Mr. President. Uh, Senator,
do you yield?
>> Absolutely.
>> Um, I think I heard this correctly, but
I just want to make sure. Um, last year
there were a lot of people who came and
really rallied against this bill, were
very concerned, um, particularly people
who practice from Chinese or um, Eastern
medicines. And so, is it true that all
of that has been resolved and I am not
going to have a whole bunch of angry
little um young folks coming to my
office complaining about this? Is that
not true?
>> That is absolutely true, Senator. And
furthermore, they were uh integral in
the drafting of this legislation.
>> Thank you so much.
>> Recognize Senate from the 14th.
>> Thank you, Mr. President. Senator yield.
>> Absolutely. Uh, Senator, isn't it true
that you've worked hard on the
definition of dry needling to make sure
that you exclude Senator questions of
bill sponsors in the well because I
don't want to get a permit.
Uh, I believe uh, Senator that if your
uh, concern is whether or not the
majority of practitioners of acupuncture
and dry kneeling live in the 48th Senate
District, you would be correct. I don't
know how many live in the 14th, but they
certainly many of them reside in the
48th. always answering the question that
matters, not necessarily the one that
was asked. Thank you, Senator.
>> You have no more questions, Senator.
>> Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the
well.
>> Does any other senator wish to speak for
against the measure?
Question is on the adoption of the
committee substitute. Is there
objections to the adoption of the
committee substitute? Hearing none, the
committee substitute is adopted. Is
there objection to agreeing to the
reporter committee which is favorable to
the passage of the bill? Chair hears
none. The reporter committee is agreed
to. Is there objection to the main
question being ordered? Chair hears
none. The main question is ordered.
Question is on the passage of the bill
by substitute. All those in favor of
vote yay. All oppose, nay. Secretary,
unlock the machine.
On the passage of the bill, the A's R4
are 49, the nays are two. This bill have

amendment. Amend the amendment to the
substitute SB70 by inserting after line
8 the following by replacing and on line
15 with the following. A nonprofit or
not for profofit.
Mr. President, that completes the order.
Recognize Senator from the 46. Speak to
the measure.
Thank you, Mr. President, ladies and
gentlemen of the Senate. Those watching
at home, this is kind of a peak behind
the curtains of what happens a lot of
times on siny die in here. If you look
in your notebook, you'll see our
original Senate Bill 170 dealt with uh
homeless people and how to administer
grants and have a count emergency
council for the homeless. It was a
bipartisan measure sponsored by the
senator from the 41st and then also
co-sponsored by the senator from the
29th and the 13th and then finally the
39th. So you had two Republicans, two
Democrats that were trying to create a
council to help homelessness in the
state. Well, that got hijacked a little
bit on day 40. And by the time it came
back to us from the house, it had
nothing to do with homelessness. And
it's now a bill to establish a grant for
rural hospitals to have backup
generators if they need them. That's
kind of how things fly around here. They
call it making the sausage there at the
end. If you're not watching closely,
things that have no uh semblance of the
original bill end up being before us for
discussion. This was never vetted in
committee in the Senate and as far as I
know not in the House and definitely not
in the appropriation process,
but it is still a good idea and it is
still a good bipartisan idea. We had in
the first week the senator from the 41st
moved to agree with this House
substitute because it's a good program.
A lot of questions had been raised that
we didn't really get to flush out um
before we had to vote that day and it
did not pass. It came very close. It had
been raised in our caucus that there
really were no hospitals that needed a
backup generator.
And we also forgot to mention the
federal plan and the big beautiful bill
uh that created a a fund for rural
health
that we applied for grants from that and
were awarded them
the rural health transportation
program. This is the request for
proposals that's hundreds of pages
thick. and our department of community
health then submitted a 64page grant
application
specifically for rural health and we
call our program the great program
Georgia's rural enhancement and
transformation of health act
and lo and behold we were awarded over
$200 million per year for the next five
years to direct towards rural health
what my
Motion to agree as amended with the
House bill just takes this into account.
It still applies only to rural hospitals
which are counties of 50,000 or less
hospitals of less than 100 beds. So
these are not large hospitals.
And I simply put in there that this
would be grant would be only awarded if
federal funds had not been applied for
and received for the same purpose. Let's
use the federal money from the big
beautiful bill to pay for these
generators as needed.
And it also limits it to only people
that need generators as of the time this
bill is signed. So this isn't a brand
new generator bill for every hospital in
rural Georgia. It's the ones that need
one that don't get funded through the
federal government.
And then if it's coming around now,
amendment 1A, it was brought up to me
earlier this morning. This is intended
for nonprofits or not for-profit
hospitals, those that are doing good for
society, not that are in the business of
making money. And that's all amendment
1A does is specify that the only
appropriate applicants for this grant
would be hospitals that are either
nonprofit or not for profit. And so I
would ask for everybody in this body to
now join together for this good cause
and in our bipartisan spirit. And I tip
my hat to the senator from the 45th both
41st both for her original bill on
homelessness and her attempt to bring
this off the table and let's try to move
rural health forward in the
transformation under the structure that
we have. Uh Mr. President, with that
I'll yield the well, but I'm happy to
yield for any questions if there are
any. You you do have one question,
Senator. Recognize the senator from the
55th.
>> Will the distinguished gentleman yield?
>> Be glad to yield to you, Senator.
>> Yes. On amendment one, uh it says
with respect to a hospital have not
received any federal assistance. Did you
mean to have it that they have not
received the federal assistance or they
have not applied for that federal
assistance?
>> I just meant that they had not received
it. We don't want to double dip, so to
speak, and it goes on to say federal
assistance for the purpose of acquiring
or installing a backup generator. So, if
they've already received it, then let's
don't issue a state grant for it as
well.
>> And and it with gentleman of the year,
>> be glad to. Is it not true that I am so
proud of this body addressing at least
trying to address homelessness as we
have to drive past people under bridges
every single day even to come to this uh
illustrious magnificent building.
>> That is true and I I do hope that our
body will address that through some
other legislation this year that's more
germanine to the subject matter.
>> Thank you sir.
>> Thank you.
Recognize Senator from the 41st. Thank
you, Mr. President. Senator, do you
yield?
>> Happy to yield to you, Senator.
>> Isn't it true that I have great
gratitude to you for picking up this
bill to make sure that rural hospitals
can get the things they need?
>> Yes. And uh it's two-way street there,
Senator. I have much respect and
gratitude for your efforts in this. And
uh I tip my hat. I should have asked you
to co-sign this amendment because you
got the ball rolling and I wouldn't have
been smart enough to bring this up
without your uh initiative, your push
along the way. Thank you.
You have no further questions, Senator.
>> Thank you. I yield the well.
>> Does any other senator wish to speak for
against measure?
The question is on the adoption of
amendment 1A and one. We're going to
take up amendment 1A first.
authored by the senator from the the
first year. Uh is there objection?
Amendment 1A
without objection amendment 1A
is adopted. Now the question is on
amendment one
which is the underlining amendment and
we're going to put that one on the board
to be voted on. So
on amendment one all those in favor of
amendment one will vote yay. All oppose
nay. Secretary and light the machine.
