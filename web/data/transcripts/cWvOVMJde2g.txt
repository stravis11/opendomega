TRANSCRIPT
----------
you you you I'm going to take him in reverse order due to the fact that we got a lot of members. I have a report that is down in the appropriations committee meeting right now. They will be up. We should have a relatively short bill House Bill 530. Representative Birchett is carrying the bill. He has asked for representative Matt Reeves to present it on his behalf. If you will just take that podium and kind of run through it. I don't know representative how familiar you are with the original version. There are just a couple of very minor tweaks in here. Have you reviewed that? I have Senator Kauser, members of the committee. Good afternoon. Here to present House Bill 530. This is legislation concerning the APEX doctrine regarding deposition of high ranking corporate or government officials. This bill was in response to a court decision. There were extensive discussions and negotiations with various knowledgeable parties who were affected by the court decision. This legislation had a lot of scrutiny and passed through House Judiciary in the floor. We believe this is important for both litigation of large civil cases as well as business climate in Georgia. Every word in the bill is important. The House passed. LC-44-2300. I believe there may be a proposal or a substitute. LC-44-2378S. So to highlight differences in what the House passed and what may be proposed. The House passed language online 43 of the proposed substitute after organization with. We have the House had unique and extensive scheduling demands and responsibilities of the executive. And then online 44 of the substitute. Any other large and complex organization that was on line 44 of the House. Line 45 of the House version. So our substitute changed two words. Two words unique only as to scheduling and took out complex as to the organization. We have unique and complex. And we would ask you to leave those in. That's the request we understand. This is a Senate committee that's reviewing it. But we do believe those words are important and are the product of extensive discussions regarding this important matter. That we weren't involved in, by the way, the Senate was not engaged in those discussions. Definitely the parties in interest were with the majority well. Our committee is relatively familiar because we had Senate bill 200 that passed out of this committee that Justice Blackwell had prepared. Dealing with the same subject matter. A little more stringent protection for business. He copied the Florida statute that is a very business-friendly state. I think we understand the concept. Mr. Wepp, if you would just sort of run through. You have seen, I think, the two changes that we had in our committee sub on the unique and the complex. I have. Yes, sir. If you would just sort of refresh my group here. Tell us the purpose of the bill, what it addresses, and how it goes about doing it. And then we'll talk about the two small changes and see how significant they are to you. Currently, there in response to some litigation that's being had with some large corporations, GMC is one of them in the beginning cases what we're trying to address here. Essentially, the issue is that whether or not a CO or high-ranking official should be required to give a deposition if they don't have unique knowledge. So there's two sides to the story here. The high-ranking officials or the officials are saying that you shouldn't bring me in for deposition because I have to run this large corporation or this large department if I don't have that unique knowledge. And on the other side, the folks that are seeking the deposition are saying that we do need this deposition. And even if you have the unique knowledge, we need you here to give it because you have a special knowledge of whatever they're seeking to get. So what we've done here is we've gotten both parties here involved under the Gold Dome in our conversations, both the folks that are proponents for APEX and the folks that are opponents of the APEX. And we've sat them down and we've worked out a deal to where no one is absolutely happy here. One group wants to go farther than the other group. And so I've been told if you get to a point where everybody is sort of unhappy, then you may have struck just the perfect balance here. So these two words you're talking about, I think that it's a three-part test the way that it's structured in the house. You've got to walk through whether or not you're an officer. And in the definition, the words that are of concern of the Senate regulated industries committee are unique and complex. So let's start with the officer. The definition of an officer says that it is a current or former hiring officer of an organization with unique and extensive scheduling demands and responsibilities. So to me, if we're just breaking down by the elements, we're looking at unique and extensive scheduling and that determined whether or not you even qualify as an officer, right? So we're trying to narrowly tailor this legislation so that we're only addressing those high ranking officers like GMC, Ford CEO, Department Head of say the Georgia Department of Revenue, Georgia Department of Ag. We're trying to narrowly tailor it so we only capture those folks without making it too broad so that we capture, let's just say, the CEO of someone that runs a hot dog stand. And so we want to say that it's both unique and extensive in your scheduling demands. I think that's, if you just take the regular meaning of the words, it's not a really hard test to determine whether or not it's both unique and extensive. I could say, for instance, the chairman's schedule is unique to mine. That's a pretty easy test to get past. I mean, I get the unique knowledge, but unique scheduling does anybody, I mean, everybody schedules different. What would make a scheduling problem unique? Well, I wouldn't say that it would be a scheduling problem, but I would just say that this is a two-part test here, right? You need unique and extensive. So we can just say extensive and it's just more broadly tailored. Unique is, I mean, I can make an argument either way, Mr. Chairman, I can argue that my schedule is unique to anybody else in this room. We can also argue that my schedule is not unique as it pertains to each house member or your schedule is not unique as it pertains to each chairman of the Georgia State Senate. So you can make it argue me either way, it's going to come down to the discretion of the judge. It's just going to come down to what the judge decides whether or not you're an officer based on this definition. I think that the two-part test unique and extensive constrains it versus makes it more broad. I mean, if we just say extensive, then you only got to get past the extensive portion. So I have a, why don't we just change and say a busy schedule? Nobody in communication says, oh, my schedule is kind of unique this week. Well, I don't get the, why that adjective is so important to the Georgia trial lawyers. I just fail to see what unique means. Why not just say, hey, I got a heavy schedule because I'm running this corporation or this department or this agency. Well, I think ultimately it's over semantics that are not that meaningful. I agree. I agree. So I would say then why why take them out? If we can, if we can say, if I can go to the judge, chairman Calliser and say, Pro-Tim Kennedy's schedule is both unique and extensive. It's unique. He's the only pro-Tim in the state of Georgia and it's extensive because he's got to be at these meetings all day all the time. He doesn't need to be here for a deposition. Then I've met the burden of saying that he's an officer. On the, on the opposite side, I could say, I could argue, well, he is unique because he's the only pro-Tim in the state of Georgia, but he's not unique in the world. There's a pro-Tim in South Carolina, Florida, et cetera. So we, I think to some degree, we are arguing semantics here, but I think it does make it a two-part test to determine whether or not you're an officer. It's going to come down to just practical good sense by judge, determine whether or not he's an officer or not. I think the point I'm trying to make is we want to make it as narrowly tailored as possible. We don't want to say that, like I said, someone that's operating a very small business is protected by its namesake, the way I understand the doctor and the apex doctor is only supposed to protect. From deposition, those folks that are at the top of these large organizations, because on one hand, you're talking about trying to get the information. On the other hand, the proponents of the bill would say, well, there's no need to get, this is just a tactic to encourage settlement, right? We're going to depo your CEO if you don't settle. So this is the protection that we're offering to say that if it's a hiring CEO and you don't have that unique knowledge, then. So you don't protect all CEOs. They would have to be CEO that in your version had a unique and extensive scheduling demands or responsibilities. Why wouldn't we just assume that every CEO has a pretty extensive schedule and has demands and responsibilities commensurate with their office? Well, we could just say officer means a high ranking officer of an organization, but you want it to be more limited than just the CEOs. They got to not only be a CEO, but you got to now they got to come and improve to the judge to get this protection that they have extensive scheduling demands and that they are unique in some manner. Unique is like, you know, a unicorn, one and only type thing. I agree. All right. So that's a policy policy objective and again, I will defer to the wisdom of the committee here. I think that this is again the apex doctrine and as it's applied at the federal level, it is for those high ranking officials, those officials that are at the top that have these extensive and unique scheduling demands. And you know, the point you're making is a good point. Why don't we want every CEO to be protected by this? I would submit to you that if I, I mean, I'm a CEO of a small LLC. It's just me, me and my wife. So should I be protected by this because I have a unique and extensive scheduling. If we don't, we don't define it like that. We just say the CEO. But, but you also in a different section, you have to have unique knowledge about the subject matter in the lawsuit. That's correct. So why shouldn't we protect every CEO that doesn't have any particular knowledge about the events in the lawsuit, whether or not their schedule, even me have a schedule? Who cares? They may be fishing in the Bahamas or something. But they still don't have the knowledge and y'all have added on this additional qualification before they get protected from harassment by depositions, which is what created the problem. They say, look, I don't only think about this. This is not in my knowledge base. And now that I have to say, not only is this not, do I know nothing about it, but I've got a very unique and extensive schedule. And I don't have time for you. Even, even though I don't have knowledge, I don't have time. Well, again, you're making good points, Chairman, but I would say that this was brought to us by the business community. And it was, and the reason it's brought to us is because the state of Georgia currently. If we don't pass this, there is no protection. If it's relevant, I can take the depot of anybody anywhere, period. And if that's what the policy objective is, then that's what we'll do. But we're trying to make it safer for businesses. This is the number one piece of legislation that GM wants to pass under the gold dome. General Motors, because of what you're saying. Their CEO was called in for a deposition. And she claims that she has no unique knowledge. But she gave some knowledge at a congressional hearing. And because we are where we are in our policy, she was allowed to be depot. And in that case, in that case, in the Buchanan, if this were enacted just like it is right here, they would be protected. Or she would have been protected. Well, what GM and these other executives brought to the Senate was Senate Bill 200, which mimicked Florida's law, which after the executive declared by an affidavit that he did not have special unique knowledge about the matters in dispute and the lawsuit. Then the burden shifted to the person seeking the deposition to show that, no, not rebut that he has denial of knowledge and also show that they'd exhausted all other means of discovery. And there weren't other ways to find the same information. So what they wanted was not to house version. That was a compromise that you guys worked out somehow to get that through the house. Well, we're going to hear from them. We'll hear from them. I don't mean to be. Well, I know I'm asking you, but it's almost like we're making a mountain out of a mole hill here. And it gets my antenna, why it's being faulty and hard unless that's a loophole that negates the whole meaning of the bill somehow. Quite honestly, I think that I mean, I I refereed the meeting. So I was there when the person you mentioned earlier was in the meeting with the opposition. And we went through the bill and we we've called out each and each section that was at issue and or needed to be worked on. And quite frankly, Mr. Chairman, the unique and complex was something that was questioned or asked for after we had that meeting. Okay. Well, you got to love the, you know, by camera legislature gives us time to air all these out. Madam Leader, I don't recognize you for question. I do have a question, Mr. Chairman. I just want to know if the CEOs above the law. No. The way you're talking about them is if they're exempt. No, I know. I don't think they're above the law. But I do think that they should be afforded the opportunity. Like for instance, if the CEO of GM is called in for a deposition to testify to whether or not there was, they there was design flaws with the cab of a truck. So why would you call the CEO and when you could get the engineer or you could get the regional person to do that? That that goes to the point that Chairman Cows is talking about. That's just plausibly you can make the argument. That's just a tactic for settlement. You know, I'm just trying to be harassing and harassing so that you'll settle. So I'm no, I don't believe the CEOs are above the law. All right, thank you. If you'll stand by, we've got a couple of people signed up to speak. Alan Richardson. Georgia Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Alan Richardson, I have a Georgia Pacific. We are supportive of we all addressing this matter. Our company which has 8,000 employees here in Georgia, 30,000 across the US. Going to Madam Leader's statement, the CEOs do get harassed with legislation, trying to bring them in on issues that they do not have unique knowledge about. For example, what we're talking about here today should someone be able to subpoena in that position Governor Kim, who doesn't know what's going here, but he is the CEO of the state of Georgia. So we appreciate y'all addressing this. I mean, Georgia's been a great place to do business, but we've had some judicial hellhole issues here. And this is a step in the right direction to get us back on the right path and we're supportive of your efforts. Any questions? I'm about to get questions. Mr. Richardson. No, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Robert Highsmith, Georgians for lawsuit reform. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Robert Highsmith, with Holland and Knight, we actually argued the beginning case before the Georgia Court of Appeals that representatives were speaking about and then just black will argue it before the Supreme Court. Give us just a little overview of that case because that's what got this entire of nobody in this building had ever heard of the apex doctrine until that case. I'm trying to hit it quick because I know the hour, but sure, the CEO General Motors Ray Barra was sought to be deposed in a case where there had been a fatality involving a General Motors vehicle. They sought to impose or to use what's called the apex doctrine. It's a doctrine that has not existed in Georgia law, but exists in the laws of several other states that says if you're at the apex of an organization, you have to before you can be deposed, you have to establish several things. And it's the things that this bill seeks to establish, seeks to codify in Georgia. Do you have unique knowledge as a CEO, Madam Leader? It's not that they can't be deposed. It's that let's have a reason to depose them as opposed to the engineer as representative stated. And they tried and failed to have the apex doctrine be applied here in Georgia. The Georgia courts, both the trial court and the court of appeals. And in the Supreme Court, in the Buchanan decision last summer said, we're not going to adopt the apex doctrine. Apex doctrine is, again, what this bill would seek to codify. Do you have unique knowledge? Are you an officer enough in a high ranking organization? And the, and what the Supreme Court said is we're not going to adopt the apex doctrine because it's not in statute. The general assembly in the Georgia Civil Practice Act, which this bill seeks to amend with the addition of a new section, 26.1, the general assembly has not spoken on this issue and has not passed into the Civil Practice Act these factors. And so we, the Georgia Supreme Court, are not going to sort of legislate these factors into the statute, Mr. Chairman. They said they're good. What the Georgia law does currently say is that you have to, you can get a protective order for good cause shown. Well, what does good cause shown mean? And the Supreme Court sent this case, the GM case, the Buchanan case back to the trial court to, and the Supreme Court said, you know what? We think these are good factors to look at. We think they're important factors to look at. We're just not going to say that they bind the trial court because the general assembly has not spoken on the issue, Mr. Chairman. These two words that are the focus of today's debate between the House version and the Senate substitute are not words that have appeared traditionally in other states that have adopted the apex doctrine. I'm unaware of any state that says you have to have a unique schedule in order to avail yourself as a CEO of the apex doctrine. The questions, Mr. Chairman, that you were asking were very appropriate. What is a unique schedule? I would have a very difficult time as a lawyer saying that Miss Berra's schedule as CEO of General Motors is unique from that of the CEO of Ford or of Kia or everybody else. It's, you know, their schedules probably look a lot alike in terms of what the, the duties of the CEO of a major international car manufacturer. Similarly, the word we didn't talk about as much the word complex, but two lines later in the House version in line 45, you have to be the CEO of a large and complex organization. And what those two words would do, Mr. Chairman, would be to get what those two words would do would be to give folks the opportunity exactly as you said to say, well, you know, I'm making this up, Mr. Chairman. You know, Bobby Lobby is a large organization, but it's not complex. It's a store that sells Bobby supplies. Again, I'll be very clear. I'm just making that up as a potential example of an argument that somebody might make. Again, Miss Berra's schedule is not unique. Look at the Ford's schedule. He too had investor relations at 9 a.m. and a board meeting at 10 a.m. and then he flew to Japan. You know, you would, those are the arguments that that a plan of lawyer would make to, to, to, to say that this person's schedule is not unique. And therefore they should not be able to take advantage of the provisions of House Bill 530. This organization might be large, but it's not complex. Just one more word that someone seeking to avoid application of what might become Georgia's apex doctrine. And that's why the Senate version takes them out. And again, my, my role here, Mr. Chairman is simply to point out to the committee that in other states that have sought to impose some version of the apex doctrine by court decision or by legislation. And there's two additional hurdles, Mr. Chairman, as you pointed them out to be, don't, are not typically, are not typically part of those states analysis that have adopted this. And they would potentially raise additional hurdles to high ranking executives that sought to avail themselves of legislation that the general sent we would pass. This version that passed the House as well as the substitute that we're considering today both put the burden of proof on the, the president of the corporation, the high ranking officials that seeking protection. And as does existing law, you're absolutely right, Mr. Chairman. And that's also true. Anybody seeking the protective order has to make the showing. And what this bill would do is, is specify the things that someone seeking to take advantage of what I'm short hand the apex doctrine, what they would have to demonstrate. Yes, the burden is on in the case of the CEO of GM, it's on her, you know, and not on the, the plaintiff or other, other persons seeking to take the deposition of a high ranking officer. Whereas the original Senate version of the apex doctrine and SB 200, once the corporate official said they didn't have unique knowledge, etc., then the burden shifted to the party seeking the deposition to persuade the judge that yes, they did or there's no other way to get this information we've exhausted other means. That's my understanding, Mr. Chairman. I aboned up on 530 more than I did 200 for this afternoon, but that is my understanding. Any questions from committee members? Mr. Heisman? All right, that's all we had signed up to speak today. Thank you. All of you. Thank you, Mr. Chair. If you'll stand by, Mr. Barchett, instead of case there's any other questions for you. Yes, sir. Senator Brass. We've got a question, I guess for you, Mr. Chairman. So what exactly did we change in the substitute? All right, you'll see in your folders, LC 44, 2300, which was the original version. Substitute is LC 44, 237, 8S, online 43. We took out the word unique. So we did take out one word and online 44 and 45. We took out complex. That's it. That's it. That's what we're sitting on, arguing for 30 minutes of. Now, I will say should be in our folders, the Metro Atlanta Chamber, the Georgia Chamber and the law, the law, the law, the law suit reform have all endorsed the Senate version here. Any further discussion from the committee or additional questions for the House will. All right, what's the pleasure of the committee? We've got a motion to do pass by committee substitute. LC 44, 237, 8S and a second by the President of Pro Tem. Any other proposed amendments? All right, all in favor, raise your hand. All opposed. Did you get to count on that, Senator? You opposed my own leader? Okay. Got it? All right, let's do it again. Pay attention. All raise your hand if you favor. Any opposed? That's correct. All right, we got two notes. All right, that passes. We'll send it on the rules committee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, committee members. Appreciate the time. And I'm happy to continue talking with you offline. Thank you. I appreciate you. All right. Okay, the other bill on our committees we'd like to finish up our hearing on the hemp bill. I had extensive testimony the other day, Representative Perkel, as you heard. I got quite a few more signed up today that want to be heard on that issue. Some are repeats that were already heard the other day. I'll save you to the end if we have time. I want to tell the committee where we're headed, the remainder of this session. We have a meeting tomorrow morning at 10 a.m. And we're going to be discussing the cannabis bill. I think that's 198 that deals with additional licenses, et cetera. We have this room from 10 until 12 and I want to focus that meeting on that bill. We also have a meeting Thursday morning here at 10 a.m. which will give us time to complete any action. My hope is and we are going to finish any further testimony on the hemp bill today. If we have changes to make based on the aggregate testimony, we will have a committee sub. I think Perkel I will naturally talk with you before we make significant changes. I don't really know what the...

of the committee is going to be, but if it's ready by tomorrow, we may have a vote on that tomorrow. If not, be prepared to vote on that on Thursday morning. Cannabis is pretty complex subject matter licensing scheme, et cetera. I want to give that a thorough hearing and in deference to Chairman Powell will spend tomorrow morning on that as long as it takes a couple hours on that. It's a committee day. And then with changes are necessary, we'll be able to make them tomorrow afternoon and then we'll also be able to vote that bill on Thursday morning. So that's the bills there was also the refrigerant bill that will probably be back on the sponsor of that bill wants a vote. I don't know what the well of the committee is, but we will have time to consider that as well. So that's where we're headed. Representative Perkle just since you look so frisky over there is anything else you wanted to add before we start taking testimony. If you have any additional thoughts because you might want to respond to some of that testimony we had the other day. All right. So I'm going to give you a podium would be probably easiest. And if you just say any additional comments you have, we may have some questions that I'm going to start calling some additional witnesses. That is very kind of you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for the committee. I walked into regulated industries and wound up in judiciary. I had never done that before. So, but one of the one of the testimonies that we heard and in the last year we had there was someone that that testified that it looks like we pulled the numbers out of thin air for what we have for the tolerance for our full panel. And so I wanted to just kind of justify some of the numbers since that was that was taken, I don't know, it seemed kind of harsh to me. And it was not taken from thin air. It was, you know, unless the Colorado area is fairly thin. Most of the changes that we have that as it relates to the residual solvents, which is the bad stuff, they want to make sure that we're protected from benzene. We have an amount less than one parts per million that is allowed in Georgia code. Colorado has about twice that. Benzene is something we won't stay away from. We know that it causes leukemia. So we don't add in the stuff for Georgia consumers. Secondly, hexane, our level is significantly less than in say in Colorado, which is where I pulled this other data from. So hexane allows about 30 times what is in this bill that we allow. Hicksane for those of you that missed the chemistry class is a, is used in, it's used in cleaning products. So while I love Lysol in certain areas not in my body, in contact with water, it releases a flammable gas that may ignite spontaneously. You don't even pour this stuff down a drain. And so we have less than 10 parts per million in other states, particularly Colorado, it's in that 290 range, parts per million. And so ours absolutely is a tighter standard for the things that can cause us problems. Most of the others are in the same alignment as other states have with ethanol and desilene also. You don't want that, it's less than one part per million. So those are the, that is just some of the changes I want not changes, but the response I wanted to make through the testimony we had the other day, when I made my statement that this language is designed to be tightly drawn, I was actually serious about that. It was not flippantly made. I want farm guard rails on this industry. And I feel like this language that we have in this bill does that. Thank you. Thank you Mr. Chairman. I'll hang on one second. Yes sir. I think one of the motivations for the bill is that the Federal Law Hemp Bill, it's passed in 2018, restricted or prohibited the Delta 9 components of some of these CBD oils that had psychoactive effects potentially. Yes sir. But then the industry sort of found a way around that using Delta 8 instead, which not as strong I guess is Delta 9, but could still in certain concentrations have some psychoactive effects, get people high, whatever is that. You understand? Yes sir. Well the intention of the bill, they're getting guard rails. I did not focus on the Delta 10, because Delta 8, Delta 10, Delta 12, I did not focus on the Delta's. What I looked at is these things that we know to be harmful solvents that are used to derive Delta 8. So for instance, as a farmer, if I took some thiamate that I use on my cotton to put in furrow and second side, and I spilled it on the floor here, and I took honey and I dribbled honey over the top of it, and I got down on all fours and I leaked up that honey. The honey is not what's going to make me sick, is the carrier to the honey that's going to make me sick. I wanted to make sure that our emphasis, there again, to me this is a consumer safety issue, and it is about providing consumer protections that we don't have now, which is the whole impetus for me for this bill. So you don't really care how much THC's in its loans. No, sir. I absolutely do in the parts of its on like line 35, 36, in that area I specifically address total THC is the sum of all these others that should not be over 0.3% on dry matter. It's a sum of, so I didn't, that is very important to me, yes sir. And if any other people test find, have more knowledge, help me out, as the committee out, I'm told there's already about 14 states that have attempted to close this loophole by banning Delta 8 altogether, and I'm not sure, I was not a good chemistry student, and so I'm not real sure that I comprehend all the different isomers and esters, etc. So y'all help me. So Mr. Chairman, I have not been a great friend to some of my lawyer friends, but I did pull up a national law review of last week, and it quotes, despite many unknowns and uncertainties about Delta 8, it remains federally legal, yet unregulated. So while I'm not trying to add loopholes, I'm trying to make our definition consistent with federal language and still protect the citizens of the state. That is my intention. I have that letter. Any questions I think Senator Rhett had a question go right ahead. Thank you Mr. Chairman. I didn't do too well in chemistry either. Did a lot of bad apology, but the last time you smoked some, could you tell the difference between Delta 8 and Delta 9? So I must say Senator, thank you for the question. I have never partaken. I will stand by my last statement that I am like, the Church Lady on Saturday Night Live, and I would have no knowledge. Thank you. All right, that Senator Brass, I recognize you then Senator Dolzall. Thank you Mr. Chairman. So thank you, Representative Perkall, for bringing this. Do we heard some tests from on the other day, and I just kind of wanted to get your thoughts on, and let's go to start with on lines 265 through 267, where we're capping the milligrams on a per-day basis and also on a per individual package basis. And I kind of brought this up the other day is if we're limiting that, then you're kind of ruling out a lot of your topical type of creams and I just want to make sure that's not your intent. That is not my intent, Senator. So I'm not a mean to cut you off, but I do have testimony today that we'll clear that up about the topical creams and the THC that is in these. Okay, well, and I guess I'll follow up to Mr. Chairman, but if we're limiting the percent of THC, which I mean federal law limits that anyway, what's the point in having a milligram per individual dose? Number one question. Number two, on the my understanding is on vape products on the cartridges, cartridges, because I had some follow up conversations after what we learned the other day. One thing I learned was on vape cartridges that you can't find a product under one gram or 1000 milligrams. So if you're limiting it to 500 milligrams, then essentially we're getting rid of all vaping as well on that. And I just want to you to understand that and that may be your intent. I don't know. I'm just asking. So as the person that ran a vape shop testified, this bill would provide about 65% of the products that they are currently using. That's not illegal. And I would concur with that. Okay, I mean, are you dead set on those numbers? Are you amenable to amendments to where they're not? We're not going to outlaw them. We're still going to keep them safe, but we're not going to outlaw them. So there again, I won't firm guard rails in place. I feel like it does it with this. I'm currently at the mercy of my friends here. But before you make that decision, I really would like to hear from a phone or friend that has has agreed to testify today. Who's your phone or friend on that saying make sure to call Mr. Wingate will will be talking about that specifically. Yes. Senator Dolezal you recognize for question there. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Chairman Perkall. Can you if you had an opportunity to review the letter from the Georgia Sheriff's Association? Not only did I review it, I talked with the president of the Sheriff's Association as well as my sheriff who is on that list. Would you mind maybe for the benefit of, well, me and the others don't understand everything that's in here. Could you highlight their high level concerns and maybe your response to those concerns? For committee members, you'll see in your folder a letter from the Georgia Sheriff's Association, objecting to some aspects of the bill and also one from the US Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration that reads to me like they're saying that the Delta aid is a controlled substance. Go ahead. So part of their concerns are guards if you look on the second paragraph they were concerned with the THC levels. 40% or more THC some sheriff's officers noticed Delta and convenience stores boasting THC content exceeding 90%, which is currently illegal under our current law. So the conversation that I had with the Sheriff's Association and there again I had a quiet comprehensive conversation with them and I do hope they're here to address their concerns because it puts me in a little disadvantage to know exactly since you've got their concerns here. I felt like in our conversation I addressed all the concerns they had but they were concerned about the healthy and safety of the citizens as am I and I'm not sure how fully they had absorbed this bill before this was written. If I can have a follow-up Mr. Chair I'm out of here. The second sentence of their letter if you could comment on that specifically our sheriff strongly opposed language concerning Delta aid Delta 10 and hemp edibles. Do you know they tell you what they oppose and maybe share your thoughts on that as well. They're again I could not comment on what they meant by that but I can say that they're concerned as I am I regarding anything that our consumers are taking that can harm them which is part of the reason why these guardrails are so stringent. But you don't and I'm just genuinely trying to find this in the bill. You don't know what language it is that their referencing is a release to eight notes. No sir no sir. Senator Lucas you recognize for a question. And the bill you you have the right about section seven the 25 to 500 milligram. Yes sir. Which just a moment to say that people we end up over over because some of them are taking more than that now and they will have to buy more packages of 25 in order to to get it. Why are we with that if they're saying that these some of these folks might might need 95 milligrams not 25. So there again Senator when there will be testimony today that will absolutely address just above section seven on lines 265 to 267. Yes sir. All right let's hear some testimony thank you if you'll say thank you. Greg Riduc I promised you last meeting since you were the next on the list that I'd call you first today. If you take the microphone please there and let's hear what you got to say. Thank you Senator. In the second time I was going to get Dr. Lopez to first he cannot be here tomorrow morning. I'd be fine. Dr. you'll need to identify yourself tell us who you are or where you work and what your views on this bill are. Good afternoon everyone again thank you for allowing me to speak today on 458S. My name is Gaylord Lopez I am the executive director of the Georgia Poison Center to 24 hour 911 service for poisoning emergencies it is how's that great I have been director since 1988. I'm a doctor of pharmacy by education I'm a board certified toxicologist by postgraduate training and as I said I've been in place for the last three decades. I want to first start off by telling you that I did have an opportunity to view the hearing last week and while I'm not a business owner I'm not a farmer I'm not a producer I'm not even a user I can appreciate the passion that these folks had in testifying about why the bill should move forward. However my passion for keeping Georgians healthy and safe of poisoning hazards is just as strong. The information I'm sharing today comes from my experience as a clinician and from a chemist. To help you out to that chairman and from data collected by the Poison Center here in Georgia and centers across the United States. Nationally the trends for accidental and intentional poisoning from consuming edibles containing THD is rising nationally for example in 2019 there were 2500 cases reported. Fast forward to 2021 6,760. In Georgia alone the cases that we've handled have tripled. We had a mere 77 in 2020 in 2022 we had 277. Pediatric cases in that same time have more than tripled as well for us in Georgia. Children less than 12 years of age make up 38% of the calls we get. Patients who are considered pediatric those up to 18 make up just over 98% of the calls that we get. Hemptoride products containing Delta 8 have been all the rage the last few years and in fact in May of 2022 the FDA issued a warning you're probably familiar with this issued a warning about the dangers of CBD and Delta 8. That was not clearly stated the last hearing but in that statement they were telling us that Delta 8 used as a food additive in any human or animal products was not considered safe and so if you look at our data over the last few years we've had 500 nearly 500 cases reported to the poison center and shockingly 44% of those cases were Delta 8 related. To illustrate the dangers of Delta 8 I know there was testimony about how people have never heard of a problem with Delta 8 and talking about the purported benefits of Delta 8. I'm going to share just quickly with you a case that we had just a couple of months ago where a physician from canestone was calling us about a two-year-old who came in incredibly drowsy, somalant and lethargic. All they were purported to have done is take one Delta 8 gummy. The patient was in the hospital in the ED for four hours. The parent then brought in the package and sure enough it was labeled Delta 8. That patient because they were not able to be admitted to canestone they had to be transferred to Choa Scottish right where they went into the pediatric intensive care unit for the next 24 hours for observation. In Georgia... Is it the THC in the gummies that's causing the erections or the... It's the Delta... You said the size or whatever. No it's the Delta 8. Delta 8 Delta 10 the isomers of THC are the ones that are causing the problem. Not the hexane, not the benzene. It's the Delta 8. If you're familiar with isomers... No, edgicase. I will... I will edgicase. The combination is all I know. The simple definition is this. It's the same chemical structure but different arrangement of the atoms. For example, if I told you my name was Dale, I used the word DA. I used the letters DALE. But if someone's using those same letters and their name is LAD, LAD, that's an isomer. So it's the same chemical structure, the same chemicals used but differently arranged. So what's Delta stand for? What's that mean Delta? Delta is the place where the double bond, if you remember from chemistry, single bonds and double bond. It's the position of the double bond. And so for Delta 8, it's between position 8 and 9 and for Delta 9, it's between position 9 and 10. So that's just a fancy term for it's just structured just a little differently but using the same atoms. This letter from Department of Justice, if you all get frisky, turn the page, has those actual drawings of the molecules, etc. Okay. So we need to get you off track. Okay. So we keep talking about Delta and I won't know what it was. Okay. So as I said, this kid was later discharged from the PICU, from the PICU. Today, and as we move forward, we have an opportunity here in Georgia to minimize poisoning to our most vulnerable patient population and that's the young. We really do need to close this loop of the isomers because it's the isomers that are being shown to be psychoactive. And the thing is, you were asking about dosage chairman and people were asking about, you know, what's the proper dose or there's 25 milligrams in a gummy, there are 500 in a bag. Here's the problem with dosing. That's all Hocus Pocus. That's all Dr. Google talking. Find me a clinical study double-blinded, crossover study involving the use of Delta 8, the use of Delta 10. You're not going to find it. Why? Because it's not being tested in humans. And so when people are saying, I need a dose of 800 and I might need to buy two packets instead of one. Where are they getting that information from? Dr. Google is one of our biggest adversaries out there in the poison world. Everyone wants to play doctor. And I'm not doubting that for some patients, there may be some relief, but find me a clinical study that shows that. So this study, talk about limiting to 25 milligrams, limiting to 500 in the packet. To me, the issue is Delta 8 has shown to be a psychoactive compound, similar to Delta 9, which is marijuana, which is not legal in our state. I say we have an opportunity to close that loophole. And if we do that, we will minimize poisonings in our population. All right. Thank you. We've got just a couple of questions from committee members and we'll let some other people speak. Mr. Vice Chair and Senator Summers. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Okay. You kind of got me a little confused here. And I understand where you're going with this, but I'm just curious about a couple things. And I'm trying to take notes here and go through the bill. You know, synthetic Delta 8 or Delta 0, which is sometimes referred to as Delta 10 will not be, it's not in CB under this bill. And we'll have lab tests during this bill. We'll have QR codes on these products and let people know what they're taking or whatever. And you're trying to sit down. I think what you're trying to tell us is we want to get rid of Delta 8. You want to stop Delta 8. I can't sign the bag. I mean, these kids can buy it over internet. They can buy it anywhere. And they can convert Delta 8 to Delta 10. You take Delta 10 and convert Delta 6. I mean, if you know your biology, I mean, you know what I'm saying? You know your stuff. You make these things happen. So what I'm getting at is two years is, I appreciate where you're coming from, but alcohol portion kills every day too. Or call a speaker. Hi, you got a question to ask it. Thank you, Mr. Amitai. All right. And enjoy on your speech, but you got a question to ask it. We got all these people out here. Want to be heard. Make me understand why you want to take Delta 8 and Delta 10 out in a short way of time when we're going to have all these controls on there and it's proven so far from people who's taking it, that they do get benefit out of it. Delta 8 and Delta 10 and the other 98 isomers that are out there that can be derived have to be individually studied before we say it's okay to use. The problem is we are currently seeing problems with Delta 8. So I'm saying if you're talking about what we need to do with this bill, we need to include all isomers. That's the problem. Not just 8 and 10, but the other ones that are going to be developed, you know, soon that might may very well have just as potent effect as Delta 9. We're seeing clinically that Delta 8 is causing kids 63% of kids who got into Delta 8 over the last two years here in Georgia have had to go to the emergency room. 68%. Follow up questions. Follow up. Follow up, Mr. Chairman. That might be because we don't have any, I'm sorry, sir. Go ahead. That might be because we don't have any controls on the bill. And that's what we're fixing to try to do is put some controls there with the QR code that tells people where it's coming from and when they get to the emergency room, if that's the case, that bottle can be scanned and they know where it came from. That question or is that a comment? I'm sorry. Okay, we're going to have a discussion at the end of the bill. It's on the time. All right, any other questions? Are you through? Thank you. We appreciate you being here. Thank you. All right, Mr. Wilwin gate and just sort of give you all get cute up out there if you're ready to. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is Wilwin gate. I'm a fourth generation native of Irwin County. I'm a reformed lobbyist so it's good to see some of my friends here. I am the co-founder and CEO of second century ag in Osola. We are the only operational hemp processor in Georgia. We were licensed in 2020. We helped Chairman Tom McCall write the original legislation when it happened. Lysis in 2021, 2022 and we are licensed for 2023. So we've paid over $125,000 in fees to the state of Georgia to be a processor. I come to thank Chairman Perkall for his work. He has been very studious in learning about this industry. I want to thank my neighbor Tyler Harper, our new ag commissioner for showing an interest in the hemp industry and for willing to learn about what we're doing. Mr. Chairman, we're the largest farm in the state of Georgia. We're the largest processor in the state of Georgia. We manufacture products. We have control from the seed to the finished product. We know exactly what is in this product. We know where it was grown. We know what steps were taken to deal with fire ants and spotted root virus and mulled and everything involved. You cannot have an industry if you do not have guardrails. This legislation, for the first time, put some standards in guardrails on the hemp industry in Georgia and Chairman Perkall, we'll thank, we are thankful for that. Now there are a lot of different ideas about what should be in and what should be not included in this legislation. I don't think anybody has talked about the farmer piece, Mr. Chairman, lowering the fees. They did the other day, but we can make your comments on that as well. Yes, sir. We want to encourage competition. We want more processors in the state. It's not practical for a grower in DeLonica, Georgia, to have to drive all the way down to Irwin County to process their material. If we can lower the processing fees and the bonding and the cost, then we're going to grow in industry. So even though we're the only ones left, we want competition. We encourage this industry as itself to grow. We are fully in support of the QR code, the full panel COA on the finished product. It is expensive to do, but we do it throughout every step. We do it in the field. We do it when we create distillate. We do it when we create finished products. We think it's a consumer protection provision that needs to be in there.

And if we do not pass this legislation, there's not going to be any standard at all. It is the Wild West. You can go buy a gummy packet and a gas station and you have no idea what's in it. You don't know if there's Delta 8, Delta 10, THCO because there's really no way to track it. This legislation will enable the Department of Agriculture to be able to go in and create a way and a method where you can test this product from the field like they're doing now to the finished product. And if you're going to grow a standard and a high standard and a high quality product in this country, it needs to be done in Georgia. There's no doubt our farmers can grow a high yield, a high quality product better than anybody in the country. We've got water, the Colorado doesn't have. We've got tobacco farmers with infrastructure in place that they can seemingly transition from tobacco to hemp. Everything is there Mr. Chairman. We can grow this industry and we can be the leader. We had some testimony of the day. Did you actually draft the bill or your company have it drafted? No sir, Chairman Prokho drafted the legislation. What about all the licensing? Why would you want that another layer of government regulation to start a license and convenient stores and gas stations before they sell a product that is a legal product and according to many in the room, harmless? The only one and I don't want to speak on behalf of Commissioner Harper. But right now the guy that grooms pets in Lacks, Georgia where I'm from, sell CBD products for us. There's no record of who actually is selling this product. I don't know why. You have a record who sells potato chips or hot dogs either. Why? Because you have to have a record to know who has actually has products on the shelf so therefore they can be tested and appropriately monitored to make sure that the QR code and the product they're selling meet those standards. The fee is, that's y'all's decision. If you have a registry of who is actually selling this product, then the Department of Agriculture like they do with grocery stores and gas stations has a, knows who do they need to go check to make sure that the inspection is being done appropriately and the products that are being sold meet the truth in labeling tests that we're trying to set forth today. The fee is immaterial but you have to have some record of who's actually selling this stuff in order to find out is this truly the product, is this product what it really says it is or if there's any labeling on it whatsoever. As far as the 25 milligram and the 500 milligram, Chairman Brass you brought up, we make products that have 1000 milligrams of CBD. They have 1500, I don't think that cap has anything to do with CBD or CBN or CBG or any of their minor cannabinoids. I believe that was just the cap for the amount of Delta 8 or Delta 10 or whatever the isomer of THC is, that's where that cap came in. Chairman Brass, you're asking a question. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Well, I'm sitting here eating a pack of gummies and I ate a pack and I wasn't satisfied. And so I just opened up a second pack and started eating it. And so I guess my concern with if we're going to cap these doses, if I want more, I'm going to get more and I'm just going to keep eating more and more and more until I'm satisfied. And I don't know what we're chasing with Delta 8 and Delta 9 and all this other stuff. But I do know that if I buy a 12 pack of beer and I get to number 6 and I'm not satisfied, I'm going to keep going. And so my concern is if we're capping these things, why would they not, I mean, they're just going to keep eating them anyway. And so that's kind of my concern with the caps and then that's one concern on the individual dose. But my bigger concern on that package dose is that we're outlawing, you know, I mean, we heard testimony. I think she said 80 something percent of her products were going to be obsolete. That's from a business standpoint. I mean, you're a business man. I mean, that's to me, it's not fair to them as business owners to put that on them. And that's not only part I'm getting really hung up on. Right. And I understand there are 500 milligram vape carts out there. That's, we make them. The issue that you're dealing with with a lot of the vapes that are out there, there are, we've been asked as manufacturers to make them as cheaply as possible, put vitamin E in them, put properly and glow, call them and we absolutely said, this is ridiculous. No, we're not doing this. The debate between the Senate as to what the milligram cap of 25 milligram or 50 or whatever and 500 versus 1000, that's for y'all to decide. And that may be a longer debate. My point to get across to you guys is we need some guardrails on this industry. We need some legislation to move forward to allow this industry to prosper. I've got farmers lined up now ready to grow 500 acres if they feel like there's going to be a market for this. We've been screwed over by, excuse pardon my French, by tobacco companies in the past who want to get into a new industry. We can be the gold standard in Georgia if we allow guardrails on this industry to allow it to grow and to move forward in a very professional manner. Senator Harbson, you recognize the incentive to build as well. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I believe one of the things that we discussed earlier was about quality, right, and control of that quality. And if I'm correct, you are competing with border states. Is that right? Would that be fair? Like Florida and Tennessee, South Carolina, perhaps. And it may have a higher dose of whatever the bad stuff is, and Delta 8 or whatever the case may be. And you are confined to 0.3%. Is that, am I hearing that correctly? Mr. Speaker, why? Okay. Chairman Harbson, yes, we compete with other states. There are no ramifications if you make more than a 25 milligram gummy and other states do that. That's not really an issue with us. What we want to make sure, though, is that we have the cleanest product on the shelves in Georgia. And the cleanest product is going to follow the protocols regarding pesticides, heavy metals, residual solvents, everything that is laid out in this legislation. That is a clean product. Senator Dolezal, you recognize for question. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for being here. You said you all own a testing facility? No, sir. Okay. You did not do testing. No, everything we do is third party, ISO accredited testing. Okay. I think when we met, I mentioned to you that I helped start and was on a board for a while of a nutraceutical manufacturing company. We've since sold it. I know that when we were manufacturing our nutraceuticals, pre-workout powders, post-workout powders, things like Garcinia, turmeric, we would test all of our raw materials in bound, if you will, into our facility. And then we would test our finished product to ensure that what we said was on the label was actually what was in the bottle. I'm curious, I understand this industry is different, but assuming the stuff is made in small batches, I'm curious what the value is of a test that says that the product was tested within the last 12 months. Because I can say that if it's similar to what we were doing, that type of labeling would have been useless because a raw material that came in could have been different. The formulation could have been different. We could have messed something up in the manufacturing process. So is this different in some way or help me understand the value of something that a formula that you approved that was tested 11 months ago, how that relates to what's rolling off the manufacturing line today? Very good question. So generally you have lot of numbers, you have batches. The shelf life of a product similar to a CBD gummy or CBN gummy or a sleep gummy or whatever is generally 12 months. Every time that you harvest a crop, our crop varies depending on the farmer, depending on the variety. We have to test different varieties, times it was harvested, to get the different levels of cannabinoids, pesticides, herbicides, all of that. We test the distillate. Now the distillate converted into a finished product is a second test that you have to do. And it varies depending on the batch number and the lot number when you do that. So our distillate may be tested one time from 2020 distillate. Distillate will last forever, it's like honey. As long as it's clean. The finished product though, you really need to test that annually because your shelf life is annually on the product. That's why we encourage it to be a 12 month test. Otherwise you may have, if you have a test that's longer than 12 months, you may have a product that's been on the shelf for 14 or 18 or 25 months and it may be not a suitable product. But isn't that true? In the course of 12 months, once you get the scale, you will be running batches that have some level of material, whether it's your distillate or the additives that you're using, doing to make the coming out of your manufacturing process. I don't know that as well. I guess my question is why is every batch not tested? It usually is. We test every batch. Okay. So you in order to get the, to dial the milligrams in right. Okay. Is that, is that, would you say that's industry standard or? If you're a true manufacturer, yes, it should be industry standard. Thank you. Absolutely. There are summers I recognize you for a question, but not a sermon. Just to when you get questions, when you first sort of first questions that came out once before here, if we have testing, okay, if we have, if I, if I, if I, if I, if I, if I, like, like all food products have numbers on their, their packaging, correct? You're simply saying if we did that, I'm just trying to ask this question right now, then you can track where this product comes from. That's what you're trying to get to. And you, you know, you've got the controls in. Is that correct? Absolutely. That's, that's what we're trying to get to. That thing. And then if you go, I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman, one, one, one follow up. We'll in reach to what they sent you. This is what I brought with us, Chairman. I'm just trying to follow up something. Tell me what it would do if, tell me what, tell me what it would do if it, to license it. I mean, that's my thoughts here. If you lash it through law, if law enforcement can see these tests, the commissioners back culture can see these tests. Is that not correct? And that will know where the products are good or bad. Is that, anytime you provide transparency and you have a demonstrated ability for a consumer to immediately access that product, yes, you're putting more information than makes it a lot safer for the public. That's what I'm getting at. This is a, this is a, we see this as a consumer safety bill. Growing in industry, making sure that we do things right in Georgia. All right. Thank you, Mr. Wingate. Appreciate your testimony here. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Would you, everyone, to please support this legislation? Dr. Robin Fowler, do you still with us? Do you, I think I had you stand up? Why can't you say that? I'm just going to use care into something. Mr. Chairman, if it's possible for me to still testify? Yeah, you're in labor, Jim. You're going to go ahead, Mr. Robin. I'm in labor. I'm going to go ahead, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Tell us, crowd, who you are. You're one of the type one licensees on medical marijuana. Yes, sir. My name is Dr. Fowler. I'm one of the class one winners on the medical cannabis license and I'm really not involved just with this bill. It's more of an observation role that I play. But for the sake of time, I'm an anesthesiologist and of course dealing with cannabinoids, I certainly feel the benefit. The question to me comes in with the isomers and the psychoactiveness of Delta 8, Delta 10. The just is that my concern is that there will be regulation so that it keeps things on the up and up. You know, a loophole to get to THC. I don't think that is the community good. I certainly just think that the regulations to keep Georgia as the setting the standard would be the best route to get. Can you give me about a 30 second to a minute explanation of Delta 8, Delta 9, THCO, what that stands for, what that means? I'm grasping for an understanding of the chemistry behind this. The simple way that I could explain it, I believe, will be the central nervous system receptors that are activated, the CB1, type 1 and the CB type 2. Delta 8 is so similar to Delta 9, THC. It actually activates both receptors which THC or Delta 9 also activates the type 1 receptor. That we see a correlation with Delta 8 specifically with euphoria, red eyes, dry mouth. Now these typically are at higher doses. You know, we'll say I think Delta 8 is more like a little brother to THC. So whenever we look at increase in consumption, I think those are those concerns really are more validated. Then I'll just leave it to that. So if you eat enough of them or whatever, then it does get you high, the euphoria, whatever. In the recollection that I have from patients, from family members from the industry, currently we have, I want to say 19 states that have banding or some similarities or some restrictions at least on the processes or the Delta 8 in industry. So I just think it's worth paying attention to. So what's bad about Delta 9? Why is it a controlled substance and other forms of hemp or not? You know. Delta 9 being THC, it's a controlled substance, of course, by the DEA. As the previous testimony earlier, they only differ by one double bond. So the ice emerged or so similar that the DEA actually has come out with a letter to North Carolina that had referenced it recognizing Delta 8 as a controlled substance. So we have that in our folders. Okay. That's what I use a lot of, I guess I would say in my research, my credibility or the credible resources that I look for are some of the agencies that, such as the DEA. So if the DEA is going to deem Delta 8 a controlled substance in North Carolina, the natural conclusion is that it would be controlled substance in all 50 states once they reach that conclusion. I don't know that that's my place to give testimony. It's in my mind that DEA, of course, is the governing body for the last 20 years in my industry as an anesthesiologist. And I use it very much as a governing body with a cannabis commission and with our current license. All right. Any questions, Dr. Fallon? All right. Greg Riducca, you're back up. Thank you, Dr.. We're going to need you back here on tomorrow morning since you're in town. We're going to talk about cannabis. Okay. There's a bill that's dealing with licenses of like yours. I think I might take it away from you. See, better be here. So you're here. Great. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'm Dr. Greg Riducca. I'm the founder and member of the Board of Directors of Georgia's for Responsible Marijuana Policy. My background has been in substance abuse prevention and treatment for the last 40 years. I've established the first chemical dependency program, a rich view for adolescents. And so I want to follow up on the remarks of both doctors, Lopez and Fowler on Delta 8. And that is to say that Senator Kankher Patrick, who's also a medical doctor, crafted some wonderful language. It's not that complex. It's not that long. That would solve the Delta 8 loophole problem, not only the Delta 8 loophole, but all Delta isemars. And it's just, it's, it was in her Senate bill 22. Unfortunately, it is not in 458. But her definition, her product, means a finished product with a concentration of Delta 9, isemars of Delta 9, esters of Delta 9, of not more than the federally defined THC level for hemp. That does it. And you all would be the heroes of thousands of parents around Georgia if you close that Delta 8 loophole. I get more phone calls and emails about the Delta 8 loophole than anything else. 40% THC in Delta 8 form is, is not illegal because Delta 8 is not illegal. It's, it's kind of that simple. It was a loophole in the federal law that allowed hemp derived Delta 8, which is made from CBD to be essentially legal. And that is a bit loophole that is causing a great deal of suffering for children, for parents, because there is no age limit in the federal law for Delta 8. So kids can buy it legally according to the Farmville. So it's a big issue that Senator K. K. Kepatric tried to solve. I hope that you will put back up on Senator Kepatric's solution. It's an easy one. It's an elegant one. And as was mentioned earlier, 14 states have blocked the Delta 8 loophole. So there's a lot of precedent there. And you know, to put this in context, I know that hemp is not marijuana legally. But biologically hemp is marijuana. So really what this would be would be the first recreational marijuana bill to pass in Georgia. We'd be looking at these edibles on shelves of publics, shelves of crogr, CVS, the marketing, unless it's restricted, would have marijuana leaves on the marketing. So as you're going down the aisle and you want to explain to your son or grandson what that is when they ask, gee, dad, gee, grandpa, what's that marijuana leaf doing in crogr? We're going to have to explain it to him. And it's not as easy, simple explanation. So I hope you will consider that loophole. There are also a lot of other things I could say. The ventriloquist that did testify and I do admire her skills with puppetry. She did say talking about cannabinoids in breast milk is something that might actually be a positive thing. Just to say that the National Institute of Health, professional guidelines recommend that cannabis use should be avoided by nursing mothers. And nursing mothers should be informed of possible adverse effects on infant development from exposure to cannabis compounds in breast milk. So I just wanted to say that. And there's a pediatric nurse practitioner who I hope also might get a chance to testify. What's our name? Laura Sirsi. Okay. We'll call Miss Sirsi now. Okay. I will keep comments. And I will not go up a ground that's already been covered. Mike, I'm Laura Sirsi. I'm a pediatric nurse practitioner. I've been doing children's health policy for a long time. I'm a former three term member of the CAHP County Board of Education. And my specialty is primary prevention of substance misuse disorders. My concerns about this bill really crystallize in three areas. And they are on lines, section six, lines 252 to 255. I understand and appreciate the diligence about the labeling about the product, adulteration, and purity. But if you go take a leave and you pick up a bottle of a leave in the grocery store, there's health warnings. Keep out of the reach of children, normal dosages. If when you have in the alcohol industry, there are health warnings on the labels in the tobacco industry or health warnings on the label. And I think there need to be some warnings that clearly states not for the use of children can be habit forming because otherwise, and a big problem with our youth is they think, okay, weed, it's natural, then it's safe, and it's not. The other thing, and I want to bring to the committee's attention, is there, as in a lot of things, there's an adult conversation about these products, and then there's a youth conversation about these products. We are struggling right now with, to try to pass a series of mental health bills. We have a youth substance misuse epidemic and opioid epidemic that's really rising among youth. We have a youth suicide epidemic. We have a mental behavioral health epidemic. A lot of that is tied to the changes that occur in the brains of young people when they're at their formative stages between the ages of 10 and 21. And those developing brains are extremely sensitive to even small amounts of psychoactive substances. So anything we can do to delay or prevent the use of any psychoactive substance in youth is going to be helpful because that usage actually hijacks the development of the risk and reward system and makes them more vulnerable to addiction in the future. And addiction as a substance misuse disorder of any substance, not just whatever they might pick up. And I'm not trying to say that every child that picks up a vape is going to end up in drug treatment, but why I will tell you from their treatment statistics that nine out of 10 adults who present for substance misuse treatment began to use a psychoactive compound or a drug before the age of 18. So it's just that exquisite sensitivity. So some labeling that would clearly make it clear that this is not acceptable for young people. The other line I wanted to let you know is there's a line in 355 that states that no person shall distribute consumable health product samples on public streets, sidewalks, or parks within 500 feet of any school or program. When such facilities are being primarily used by individuals under 21? In our alcohol and nicotine regulations in this state, no sampling is allowed. Just because again, when you have sampling on the streets, it's going to be very difficult to keep access from youth from happening. And somebody distributing samples on the street is going to be expected to card everybody that walks up to them. And if I go to a festival on Mary out of Square where there's booths and they're sampling some of these products, somebody got to walk around and count how many kids are there. And if it's primarily being used by kids, they got to stop. Just it's an enforcement issue. So I think sampling needs to be done in age restricted facilities only. I would also ask that, and of course you would grant further in existing retail outlets, but to restrict the ability of a licensee to operate within the same distance of schools, churches, or playgrounds that has been in our alcohol regulations since prohibition. And that's 200 yards. Again, when the vape industry first got going, we had some vape shops that were opening up a caddy corner to an elementary school and putting their signs in big, bright primary color letters. So, and then my third and final comment would be on enforcement. And if I could direct your attention to line, 3.699 to 378. And as was stated before, there are going to be thousands of retail outlets that are going to be selling that should not be selling without proper IDing to folks under 21. But the only enforcement in this bill says that any compliance checks or enforcement is a responsible responsibility, the commissioner of agriculture, acting through special agents or enforcement officers of whom there are few and already stretched and just Medicare as a commission. I don't know how many special agents there are. I don't. But it's a curiosity question. The reason why I say this is we have the same problem when the tobacco laws were the tobacco 21 was passed in Georgia because enforcement is restricted to a very small number of revenue agents. And your local police jurisdictions cannot enforce the law. And if you had a shop and we did in one of the communities that I've worked with, they knew they had a store that was selling to minors on a regular basis. But they had to get a revenue officer to come with them and actually witness that violation for to have any teeth. And on top of that, there's criminalization misdemeanors for anybody enticing someone to enticing a youth to buy. But line 376 and 378 said any other use of individuals under 21 years to test compliance or any similar provision shall be unlawful and the person's responsible shall be the subject to the penalties prescribed in this article. So if you've gone to put guardrails in place, they've gotten to be enforceable to protect our kids. And I would just ask that you not prohibit, not mandate, but that you would not prohibit local jurisdictions from being able to enforce a bad actor who's selling the kids. And also, I think your secretary has two documents. One was a emergency preparedness that's called a health action alert, that's the CBC put out. Two providers to alert them of increasing issues of children being admitted to emergency rooms with problems with Delta 8 products as well as an FDA document that explained their position. It says Delta 8 has serious health care risks. So I also would support any efforts to close that Delta 8 loophole. And I thank you so much for your attention. I've tried to be as concise as possible and I appreciate you. I know in one second. All right. So you are a pediatric nurse practitioner. Yes, sir.

Practice have you seen children with adverse reactions to ingestion of Delta 8 or Delta 9 or 10 or any of these My my clinical practice has been lately in with newborns So I did primary practice for for 19 years, but before the delta's became practical What I do do right now is I I I work in primary prevention of substance misuse disorder and I speak nationally and do training and technical assistance with schools jurisdictions including some in the state of Georgia and elsewhere So do you think Delta 8 should be restricted from sale to people under 21 or banned altogether? I think it should be restricted under 21 and I would agree that closing that Delta 8 loophole in the current regulations would Would stop confusion and again if I can draw an analogy But I was thinking the closing the loophole is a ban So you're if you want to close the loophole you don't want them to be allowed to sell it anymore My concern is reduce and access to kids and I would leave you know what they the The decision on a total Delta 8 ban or not, but but most of your pediatric professionals would prefer it not be on the market Or if it is it was labeled and severely restricted against youth being able to access it Okay, thank you for being with us Okay, I've just about lost my Chorum here. I had a couple of people that had signed up the other day and are back again today and I'm gonna Let them speak I'm not gonna be able to hear all of you here I can tell by the sign-up sheet where you check the box if you're for against the vast majority are in favor of this legislation I Don't ever like to cut off debate, but we have a limited number of days in our legislative session And we really got about 48 hours left in the Senate to get bills out of committee if they're gonna go to the floor So in night and avoid killing the Medical marijuana bill tomorrow any other legislation. I'm gonna Have to kind of move on if any of you have comments and you're sitting there about to bust at the seams that that you really Are disappointed you didn't get to share them you are free to submit those by email in writing my office is down the hall at 432 you can drop it off you can email miss Cindy West Senate dot GA dot gov and she can make sure that the committee members have them in their folders to review I'm a reader. I'll be up tonight reading a lot of the documentation has been given to us trying to formulate my head Kind of where the consensus might be and I'll reach out to committee members as well to get some input and the sponsor of the bill before we go any further Yasser Ali I think I had you down the other day and today are you here today? Okay, I wanted to give you a chance and Michael Mumpers Are you here? Couldn't okay. What I'm sorry. I couldn't get there. But how about Reginald Reese? Reginald Reese here today All right, well, I think I've done pretty good of hitting most of them then I do have James Hyman that I know was here the other day and you're back today. Do you want to talk? Have at it if you're go What's your name again? Okay, why are you pointing at him? Okay, nice you're you're go if you want to Don't feel obligated You Good evening, Senators. I'm not a public speaker and I don't want to try to ramble. I just wanted to Talk about a few of the points that I put out there earlier and Just give you a little briefing again. My name's James Hyman I'm one of the partners of a conglomerate of vape shops called peach tree vapor and peach tree vapors background Is safety we have a we've a five-star almost five-star Google rating You can check the reviews for yourself Companies also own partly by an FDA registered an OTC certified lab so we're aware of marketing and labeling standard operating procedures We only purchase from manufacturers that have CVA's like we've discussed over and over both last week and today This ban I don't really understand it. I don't know if it's if it's it sounds more like a kid problem and it keeps coming back to Kids are getting a hold of it kids are getting a hold of it and um you have to be 20 run to purchase these products And if they're getting a hold of them I don't know where they're getting a hold of not enough. They're getting from gas stations I don't know if they're getting from something on the streets Everybody gets carted walking into a shop in a vape shop I think if there was some kind of parameter put in place with these products where your primary product you sell is That type of product it will keep it out of Maybe bad hands whether it be gas stations someone mentioned it's going to be in Kroger or publics I've never seen that I don't understand that there's not many that makes sense to me I just hear things that make my blood boil but at the same time I do want people to be safe and and having CVA's having correct labeling All that we're all in favor of Delta aid is about Poor the research I've done about a fifth the potency of Delta 9 We have many many customers that use these products and I will tell you easily average age probably 40 to 45 years old We don't have 21 year old kids coming in to get high If they want to get drunk and get high or whatever they're going to find what they need to find We have Topper people coming in For five or my knowledge of for sleep issues for anxiety there It's used properly It is a great product Kids people are pharmaceutical drugs that don't agree with them when they don't like I think that's basically it Just labor the products buy from correct companies with CVA's It's always been 21 and up so I don't Understand when people say a ten you are can buy this or a twelve you're all can buy it It doesn't happen. I haven't seen it um Keep it in the shops Where people can talk to people and understand why they want it We spend 30 minutes where the customer somebody comes in with an element we find out what The problem is we start low we will give them a product that we think works at a lower amount They try with the lower amount they typically get an effect from it if they need a little bit better effect To fix their malady they can choose a little bit more We're having amazing results from it Teach the people how to use it. They're going to use it properly And it's helping We appreciate you being here What's your name? Rick come talk quick Rick height You are against the bill partially all right tell us why so that's why I'm calling you to balance give you Well, I appreciate it. Yeah, thank you for taking the time to hear us um So the gentleman um, I'm sorry mr. Perkle I think yes The guy who introduced the bill um the heart of the bill as we've all been talking about is consumer safety right and And at our shop I forgot to tell you guys who I am so I'm I have a Line of a CBD stores. We have three shops From Atlanta to Alfredo all the way up in a Dawsonville. It's a small company about 15 people um, and i'm surprised that I haven't heard anybody here mention this problem with the testing that's in the bill Uh, because we're asking for the the product in the bill to be tested at the finished goods level Right and and i want to draw like a little bit of a picture so if If I have a kilo of distillate right that comes from the raw plant That's a million milligrams in weight right that's what a kilogram is it's a million milligrams So it's a thousand milligrams times a thousand or a thousand grams times a thousand milligrams right at 90 percent Concentration that's 900,000 milligrams you're making gummies that are 30 milligrams you're getting 37,000 gummies Out of a single kilo So a kilo looks like this you guys know about what like what a liter of coke looks like right it's about that much a thousand Gummi bag is you know 11 pounds you hold it like this and you're making 37 of those bags You're diluting this product down at such an incredible amount that testing for pesticides and solvents and all of this stuff at that level is pointless It really it doesn't make sense the the test the full panel tests needs to be done immediately after extraction when they make this product It grows in the field somewhere between 15 and maybe 25 percent is like active compounds Then it's distilled down to a very concentrated form usually over 90 percent and then at that point you do your solvent remediation You pull out any of the stuff that's bad that's supposed to be in there pesticides and then you test that product And if you get a result for pesticides on that lab report a chromatogram looks like a little histogram right you You could have a tiny little spike of pesticides or hexane or whatever The bad thing is that you're looking for in there and I can do math I know how much oil to add to that to crash it out of the report And so we do all of our testing at the distillate level and and you know we're we're horizontal We don't control everything from seed to shelf we go by the distillate after the farmers already done his thing after the extractors Already done their thing and then I go by the the kilo I send it off to ACS labs down in Florida for a test And if it passes everything at that level I know anything that I make with that any copacker that I use to produce a product Or anything that I put in the shell on on my shelf is not going to have any of those things in it because I've tested The precursor this this gives away Free to hide things in in that in that bill So you know that's the reason that I'm opposed to it primarily and I've got a few other points here For them, but yeah, go ahead back up. I wish I could hit rewind what was the last comment? Why are you opposed? Because this gives you a way to hide pesticides in a finished good you're only asking for the product to be tested at the Processing level distillate level correct correct. Yeah. Yeah, all right Because yeah, if you have a little bit that shows up and it meets the you know like a little bit of pesticides or hexane or whatever It just because it's under the LOQ of the lab that's doing the testing doesn't mean that it's not in there It just means you can't see it in the finished good so you get ATL are correct. What is that? It's a CBD shop so we have so you're just a retailer Kind of so you can make in the compounds yourself. No, I'm not in the backster and the kettle But I tellers do the kettle stirring or is that all I'm aware of no, no, it's all done through a certain process You made me think you were No, but I have to know all of that because you were making the comp me and making your own gummies No, no, I'm so I'm commissioning the gummies to be made though Okay, so you know that that's why I'm so familiar with this process because I know What steps you have to take to get a product to market and it's it's not that I have to make it But I've got to be responsible in who I do business with so that I know that what I'm putting on my shelf is safe for my customers You mentioned getting your products tested in other labs. That's not required under Georgia law now is it not currently? Okay, you're just doing that as a measure of customer service so to speak That's correct. Yeah, yeah, that's the way we think it should be done We look out west and we see how they do things. We know those regs are coming this way So yeah, we're set up like a store witness mr. Bush the other day said he also is doing that Is that fairly common in the industry that the retailers are having this third-party full panel testing independent labs with the reputable Companies, yes, I can't speak for what you find at any corner store anywhere But yeah, if you think you ought to have to have a license to sell these products. I'm not opposed to it You know if it's not cost prohibitive. I mean we're a small business if you made it a million dollars That's not gonna work, you know, but I mean we're absolutely not opposed as a retailer as a company to it Obtaining a license of a re with a reasonable fee associated with it. I think you've outlined in here 1500 or 500 There's a and I would have no issue with that as an annual fee. I didn't mean cut you off No, no, you threw me a curve that I couldn't cut I go ahead you got a couple more points then we're gonna have to wrap it up I do yeah, and the other thing I haven't heard mentioned and it's not in the bill is child-resistant packaging There's a there's a whole industry around marijuana packaging out west and we have them in our backyard here There's there's a company I use over a Norcross that creates child-resistant pouches for these gummies You can get opaque bottles that don't display the product that you have to push down in turn and we get complaints on it because adults can't open it You know, we get those calls in and so if there's there's all this concern about this getting into the hands of kids and nobody's mentioning The child proof packaging which is out there and in our opinion should be a requirement and we're doing that today Because at the end of the day, you know And it's about the product category, right? So if if it's an edible if it's a you know fruit flavored type of thing You know then you know kids know how to eat that a kid's not gonna accidentally buy a bag of flour and accidentally roll it up and Accidentally smoke it, you know, but they may if they have a gummy accidentally eat it, right? And so putting Common sense kind of safeguards on those types of products. I think are necessary and you know some of the other things like you We can't go too far with that. I know some states will make you have to have the little zipper bag that has like 18 locks between you and the product inside Bags cost the consumer ten bucks a piece and those dispensaries aren't paying for that. They're passing it on to the consumer So there's a certain reasonable level. I think that we can take this and and it's stuff that we already do same thing with the labeling Right on our bottles every last one of them says not intended for for use by children not not allowed for miners Don't use if you're pregnant don't use if you're breastfeeding It's all right there on that label with the with the QR code that doesn't take you to a lab page We got a sift through batch numbers. It takes you to the actual lab report for that product And that's the way it should be and you have you know a lot of variance in this industry because it is not yet standardized But if we look out to some of the other states that are Around us and out west this these are the things that they've already figured out they've already done this And you know to be ahead of the curve That's what we've done as a company is gone in and and made those things a reality When you come into my shop there's a big wall with a six hundred pound mag lock on the front door You can't just walk in you come up and you show an idea and if you don't pass the age check you sorry take a hike You know, so we're doing that kind of stuff today and that's the way that it should be done And and I think that you know that age part no issue The other thing that I have a problem with and I'm trying to be quick you can tell Is the definition of hemp if we get out a lockstep with the federal guidelines as far as what the definition of hemp is It could potentially kill interstate commerce which would put me out of business because we buy a lot of our products from Oregon California Colorado because that Georgia is just not mature in that area yet There's not a lot of Georgia farms the gentleman that came up here earlier said he's the only processor in town So I mean you'd be able to sell those products if you had they all had to be tested to the Georgia Department of Agriculture lab um From all those other states well no It's it's really the more the definition of it about the compounds that have to to be in there So you know for for us to change anything about that definition Which is what all the other states that haven't gone in and changed their own ledger or made their own legislation against this Then everybody's on the same playing field so your interstate commerce can be fair So Georgia grown hemp can be exported to states that share that definition Other states hemp can be imported into Georgia to create competition which You know benefits me as a horizontally integrated person or a company because I can now go and I can find the actual Best product out there to bring into my shop and and serve with the consumers So that's my concern with the the bill there Um the milligram limits we've beaten that one to death um The only one thing I want to add to that is is the fact that it'll kill flower sales and vape sales Um well vapes you could get away with doing a half ml cartridge, but people are just going to buy two so I don't see a point to it Flower can range between 20 and 45 percent Uh active cannabinoid content right so One gram of flowers 1,000 milligrams in weight if it's 40 if it's 40 percent that's 400 milligrams in one one gram of flower So customers that want to come in and buy seven They're now given seven packages right they're still going to buy it you haven't told them they can't buy it in here But they're still they're going to buy seven packages that makes my packaging cost go up by seven fold That makes their cost go up because I'm obviously going to be passing that along to them. That's how business works So you know, I don't see any point in those and I'll just leave it at that um I think I'm gonna have to wrap you up right now then uh you good you won't last can I do one more you can all right I got one more for you so the um Let me pick a good one here Uh Yeah, so we went through the all that so yes C-O-A labeling age resistance child resistant packages gotta have it um the other thing Sebastian said on on on Thursday I wanted to clear that up because you guys all kind of gasped when he said there's over 90 compounds that are psychoactive um caffeine is psychoactive Psychoactive just means that it affects the mind in some way Uh, it doesn't necessarily equate to get you high, you know And and that that's I think an important distinction to make because I felt like he was discussing it from a very scientific standpoint using the word psychoactive appropriately but colloquially psychoactive means get you high and I just wanted to clear that up because that There's not as far as I know there's not 90 compounds in there that you can use for that purpose update products get you high It depends on how how much you take again. That's that's you know It's like anything else you have one beer and you're good to go you have eight and you know Maybe not so much so it just depends on responsible consumption and and and you know how the user uses it And and to the gentleman that mentioned that the like the two-year-old um I wanted to know if that two-year-old died. I mean I figured you would have picked an example I'm not questioning him now. Well, that's fair But I figured he would have picked an example of death as his worst case and so I just I wanted to you know that that's an issue of of parental oversight Childproof packaging and just responsible handling and use of these these materials, so that I'll leave it at that I appreciate your time Did anyone over there have questions about any of that stuff? I know I kind of rambled on because I know we're getting short on time But it's thank you Drew Hall would you like to be heard? I know you traveled to get here. You're not on spot. You don't have to be here and Joseph McCormick you all work Yeah What's your name? Committee thanks for giving me time my name is Drew Holt. I'm from a company called True Terpenes We're a key ingredient supplier throughout the hemp industry as well as servicing the recreational cannabis industry throughout the United States and in several international economies That have a hemp as well I work as a product formulations and I've had the privilege of of working with very large brands throughout this hemp space and seeing this space grow over a decade as the distalits and formats have changed And I want to be clear that I really do encourage clear regulations But the language in the current bill is unclear as far as I'm reading it and I think it would confuse a lot of product producers Processors and farmers and create undue burdens on them for example We've repeatedly referenced ifemers throughout this committee meeting and It's not clear to me exactly what the intention of that language is as well as how it should be interpreted when something like CBD is by technicality and isomer of THC And I think that these things are very flippant with the organic chemistry that requires a high sensitivity and a big knowledge of chemistry in order to execute correctly As well as the difference in similarities between molecules not necessarily indicating a similarity of effect or use case Again the same criticism applies to the use of the word esters which is a relatively broad category Which I understand the intention is to limit intoxicating materials But this chemical language does not necessarily do that in terms of how a processor should interpret it and what distalits they're making As well the list of solvents that's been proposed here seems extremely aggressive as far as any solvent standards in terms of consumer safety It's difficult to understand why 29 fold hexane difference between 290 ppm versus 10 would be proposed And I don't know if there's any toxicological motivation that I've read before or seen other Manufacturers deal with in terms of those high limits It seems that it would create a difficulty for interstate commerce more than ensuring consumer safety by any standard We agree that Definitely agree that it's important that regulations allow delta 8 to continue in the market as this is Gonna have a huge economic impact if the delta 8 were to be banned completely It's key to the success of the farmers in the hemp industry as it's been a major economic outlet for the flower For extractors. It's one of the key materials that they are producing and for the shops I know it drives a huge portion of the sales of the products that people consider therapeutic It's also important. I consider to adult freedoms as many people are using these for therapeutics for different reasons And not with the explicit intention to get high and in many circumstances as an alternative to the things that got them high before or that they Are trying to get away from Such as life difficulties. I'm even non substance abuse things like PTSD or fibromyalgia Thank you clear regulations should include packaging and labeling requirements limitations and age restrictions And I think everyone that I've met in the large processing side of the industry could get extremely behind those and considers those extremely sensible While the more detailed analysis of the chemistry that's been proposed here Creates difficult to understand standards that do not necessarily lead to a clear outcome Where consumer safety is centered. Thank you for your time. I really appreciate it. Thank you Your lambda Yo come on up your lambda go ahead come come up here Come sit on the front row No ma'am go go to that podium. I'm speaking to another gentleman back there Good evening. I appreciate you all allow me to speak briefly My name is your honor. Bennett and I am the co-founder and operations manager of the Georgia Medical Canada Society We are a five or one C three non-profit organization that has been assisting patients with navigating through Georgia's low-dose THC program since 2019 I'm a goal is to ensure that underserved communities low income veterans disabled and previously incarcerated persons have access to affordable cannabis and medical cannabis cars and in accordance to the prospective state laws we believe in patients over profits In the previous hearing and also this hearing We first the patients visiting emergency rooms and urgent care over consumption of hemp and from derived THC The issue is due to lack of knowledge about the product Hosea 4 and 6 says my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge My people don't under my many people don't understand how to use the product So this could be the reason why so many people find themselves in the emergency department So instead of putting the blame on the product place the place it on the lack of knowledge classes Yeah Place it on the lack of knowledge Classes on materials and instruction should be available for the consumer if a vendor sells the hemp products You know go on I got just a little bit more. Oh, that's it. Okay. Oh Oh, yeah, I'll be back tomorrow. I'll be back tomorrow for 196 like I can like I say But I just want to let you all know that the reason I are those CBD gummies or they are TAC Oh That's a median on our committee that thought that'd be funny. Okay. I got you the only reason why I The reason why I asked because I was very concerned as far as how you are were ingesting Because I heard it yeah, yeah, because I was concerned because I was like that's why I said the lack of knowledge Two packs I got you okay, so we're scared to death after all this testimony might In that case that's right. What is your name? Okay, something unique and Complex you want to tell us come on Because our last build double those two words complex and unique Yeah, I'm gonna give you about a minute and a half two minutes because uh, I'm gonna read really really fast then Hello, my name is Sammy and more. I'd like to start by thinking the committee here for For your time I'm the owner of cloud nine smoke company. Yes, my schedule is unique and extensive and I cleared it I cleared it to be here today and This is in very important to our industry cloud nine has over 50 retail locations across Tennessee, Florida And of course the majority of the locations are in Georgia We currently employ over 400 employees with the payroll that seven figures a month Our business did over 48 million dollars in revenue last year and over 12 million dollars In hemp products alone between the taxes Sales tax payroll tax tobacco tax income tax and vapor tax that includes hemp products Was over eight figures that I paid last year This bill will eliminate half the workforce and the taxes we pay for this state overnight Our business has grown substantially the last few years We attribute our growth to focusing on taking care of our employees Mentoring them on skill development and giving them opportunities to one day Own their own franchises. We currently have eight franchise locations who also Each contribute to their to the employment payroll sales tobacco and taxes to the state last week Sorry last week I heard the committee members ask which state has Put regulations around this product. I looked into it myself And we can take a look at our neighboring state, Florida for example Florida's part of the 11th circuit with with Georgia Florida also regulates hemp products through the department agriculture But unlike this bill at hand Florida does not specify a limit for the amount of milligrams on hemp product packaging It has worked very well and been very successful for them We can mirror Florida's bill by taking out the limitations of hemp milligrams without issue That Florida law is 581.2177 If the 500 milligram limit is imposed the customers will just will just buy more The cost of acquiring the merchandise was go up for the for the end consumer furthermore there There are several other products that will be eliminated from the market entirely Loans creams etc that simply cannot be made a manufacturer at a lower milligram to effectively help the customer And the bet the best solution is to take out the milligram just as Florida did So similar to this Florida Department of Agriculture Currently issues licenses to retail hemp establishments which I believe is a great idea as well To keep something like that in the bill to ensure the proper and equal regulations of businesses

who sell hemp in the state. We saw in the bill that there was going to be a minimum age of 21 to purchase the hemp products. At our establishment, our minimum age is 21 years old, regardless of what products you're buying. It's not that the product is bad, but just like other over-the-counter flu medicine and video games and even tennis lawns, some have age requirements because the requirements in place in the business abides by that no problem. Requiring lab testing, a passing COA is great. But having a 12 month span on the COA will be problematic and impractable for retailers to keep up with. Currently the bill requires a manufacturer to have a COA done in the last 12 months of the product. The problem with the language is that the product shelf life is typically longer than 12 months. This language put unreasonable requirements on retailers to audit the product and send back to the manufacturers every 12 months to get a new COA. Thank you and I appreciate all your time and consideration. Thank you and thank you for your patience for hanging in here. All of you, we appreciate your citizen input. Hey, baby, we'll see you in a moment. We came here from every single one of our 11 million citizens in Georgia, but your input is invaluable in this process. To my committee members, thank you for being so strong and durable to hang in here with us this long. It's not often that we demand this much of you, but I appreciate your diligence you're doing your job. And the honey bee may fall out over there if we ain't careful. We, Chairman Perkel, thank you. I know a lot of time and effort. I will meet with you tomorrow. Tomorrow we're going to hear House Bill 196 that's on cannabis licensing. We'll be 10 to 12. Same thing on Thursday if needed. We'll be 10 to 12. Try to reach some resolution on both of these bills. And not really interconnected, but boy, they're sure similar when it's the same plant pretty much what we can tell. Senator, you got a comment for wrap up? Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I know you asked our professional educator to come back, Mr. Bush. Did you need anything from him for this bill or was it you need him for Tuesday tomorrow? I was just saying he was one of the best witnesses we ever had and he had signed up again today. And I love having his expertise to share with us. He taught this committee a lot. And I feel like that's our job. He's trying to learn a lot of different subject matters so we can make sound policy judgment decisions. One good thing is it's a two-year biennial. Sometimes bills take more than one year studying to get them right. And having the two bodies earns out difficulties as well. And we'll see what we can do with these. Thank you. Yeah, there was a couple of people that looked like you're at state that you didn't get heard. Just hang around, come up here and talk to me afterwards and I'll let you know if we can talk to you tomorrow and get something right and to put in our files for when we make decisions. With that, everybody have a good evening. We are adjourned.
