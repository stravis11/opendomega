Good morning everybody good morning if you if you would please come in members take

some committee meetings going on that I think they're if dismiss of those
members can join us now but we'll we'll go ahead and start them will ask
Jim Weaves, the opening for your order, prayer, please.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Let us pray.
A father guy would thank you for the gift of this day of the award.
We would just pray that you bless each one of us and give us the wisdom and sermon that you would have us use in matters for us.
Please bless our families.
Those that are serving the capital fund and all these things we ask you pray in Christ now.
Thank you, sir.
Okay.
Okay, let's start.
We'll hear from our Senator Prins.
Senator, come on up.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.
It is my pleasure to bring before you today,
Senate Bill 109.
Senate Bill 109 grew out of the tragedy
of one of my constituents in Columbus, Georgia
that had a son, a member of the National Guard,
who was killed in an automobile accident,
and he had been covered by a particularly insurance,
and that insurance refused to pay.
He contacted the office.
I turned contacted Commissioner King's office,
and we worked together to come up with this piece
of legislation, hopefully this will never happen
to another member of our armed services again.
This helps military families,
and the prayer for this will allow that to happen again.
Okay, thank you, Senator Harbson.
I don't see any questions for you.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Yes, sir, Senator Centric.
Morning, Chairman, committee.
I'm here to present Senate Bill 191,
which is the identical language of House Bill 569,
carried by a freshman representative, Jud Howard.
It passed the House on March 4th, 170 A's
is zero nays. It is an identical language bill for the Department of Labor
having to take any questions. Okay, don't see any questions. Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I always like to give up date on our finance committee.
We passed out 12 house ways and means bills last week. Should pass out six possibly seven
tomorrow. So we've got a bunch of them, but we're working through them over there.
My Senate bill 162, this has been about a year in progress.
We've used the medical students as the guinea pigs,
but in the meantime, the composite medical board
has procured new software that's used
and proven in other states.
So we got licensing and credentialing.
It's taken about seven months,
sometimes longer to get somebody in the system and working.
We think with the licensing part,
we can have that done with a couple of weeks
the Georgia Hospital Association is supportive of using this same system to
credential people. So we will be able to have people working in two weeks instead
of many months in our health care system. It's going to be a great thing for our
state. And I also will help us get people from out of state who you tell them
well I want to hire you but you can't come here for seven months they're less
likely to come. Additionally there was added under this bill at the request
the composite medical board, some language that had gone through chair Cooper's committee
where they were trying to regulate off-level use of ketamine, that part's not mine but
I do support it.
Okay, you've got a question for it, Prokteam.
I just had a question, Senator, which healthcare workers would this pertain to?
Well, this is only the composite medical board, so it will be the physician, so I know there's
a separate, I'm not part of that, we kind of split it up, there's separate going on
with the Secretary of State with nursing, so it would be the physicians, the PAs, the
AA's and the Advanced Practice and Nurses Protocol agreements.
So, would apply to nurse practitioners?
It would apply to nurse practitioners.
Thank you.
Okay.
I don't see any other questions.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Yes, ma'am.
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and rules of members of the rules committee.
I'm Sylvia Wafer Baker.
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the rules committee.
I'm Sylvia Waffer Baker.
This is House Resolution Bill 463.
The proposed resolution seeks to designate March as Autoimmune Disease Awareness Month
in Georgia.
Autoimmune disease has impact thousands of Georgians disproportionately affecting women
and people of color, yet awareness remains low.
Establishing this month of recognition will help raise public awareness,
encourage early detection and diagnosis and support research
and policy initiatives aimed at improving patient outcomes.
Recognizing autoimmune disease awareness month demonstrates
Georgia's commitment to help equity and highlights the state's dedication
to supporting residents facing these chronic,
often invisible illnesses.
Thank you, and I welcome any questions.
Okay, thank you, ma'am.
I don't see any questions.
Senator Burns.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, committee.
I bring you, Senate Bill 145.
This is the Augustus Judicial Circuit
to add a six judge.
I want to thank Representative Newton
for his support in the House
and his identical bill that he sponsored.
and I look forward to your favor, consideration.
Okay, you have a question,
if you can, how long does it keep going?
Yes, sir, not pertaining to the bill,
but to my good friend, the senator
with all of your pedigree.
Oh, my.
I'm in trouble.
I've noticed that we have a meeting
in Senate public safety tomorrow morning
on the speed zone camera bill.
Is that a threat?
It's 6 a.m.
6 a.m.
Yes.
Not of my making is there any chance
with all of your influence
You can get them to meet at a normal time impossible now that is Senator Robertson and I take no responsibility for the sketch
But I look forward to seeing you at 6 a.m. 6 a.m.
That's pretty early
Okay, don't see the other questions. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman
Okay, come on
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, thank you, committee members.
I appreciate you here in Senate Bill 276 today.
That's LLC number 520780, Senate Bill 276 as an agency bill brings Georgia into compliance
with federal requirements.
The U.S. consolidated appropriations act of 2022 requires states to have laws in effect
that bar-level third-party payers from refusing medical,
refusing payment to Medicaid for a service based solely
on the fact that prior authorization was not issued first.
Medicaid is the payer of last resort
and only pays for covered services
if there's no other liable parties.
This could be a commercial insurance plan,
a lawsuit settlement, or a workers compensation settlement.
The bill would help uphold the integrity of the Medicaid
program increase revenue to the program. As payment by primary sources are unavailable
to be denied based on a requirement for prior authorization. Mr. Chairman, I'll take
any questions. Okay, Senator. No seeing any questions. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Senator
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.
This is Senate Bill 55, LC55-0416, and it's named a Dignity of Pay Act.
This bill is about stopping certain employers, which is community rehab program, from paying
people with physical and mental disability less than the federal minimum wage.
and one of these agencies actually pays a little 22 cents an hour to follow up on the question by Madam Peruvian.
I had no parents that reached out to me about this bill. So, thank you.
I hope you know, don't see any questions. Thank you, Senator.
Thank you, sir.
Go ahead.
No, no questions.
Good morning.
SB 291 is on page one, halfway down.
This is the last bill under modified open rule.
There's a special seed license plate.
Got a beautiful picture of the American flag
that'll be displayed on people's car tags
with two words across the bottom.
It says America first.
Okay.
Do you have a question?
It's a move.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I do have some concerns as we have
one of the only Jewish legislators in our caucus who has expressed extreme
distress over the affiliation of America first by anti-war and Nazi
sympathetic organizations in World War II. Have you had an opportunity to speak
I have not spoken to her this session at all, no, ma'am.
Well, that is a concern of mine and hers, and I certainly would respectfully request that you speak to her about this particular conversation with her.
Thank you.
with part. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Gooch, I know you've introduced this a few times
or came and requested this bill a few times last year. What organization would these proceeds
go to? We'll go into the general treasury of the state of Georgia.
Okay. Leader Heagley, did you have a question? Okay. Okay. Don't see any other questions.
What do you mean, Chairman Jansker says?
Thank you, Mr. Leder.
Appreciate you bringing this bill,
because I just want to put a good word in on this,
is that this is one of the few bills
I see many positive comments,
so I'm normally going to get negative comments
to enter the gauge.
But this is one that, last and split,
that I've gotten many positive comments
and appreciate you working on this.
Sure.
Thank you.
Okay.
Thank you, Senator.
Thank you.
You guys have a good day.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, page two, halfway down is SB 121, and it has to
do with limits of liability carried by someone who is convicted of DUI.
Our current Georgia limits are 25, 50, 25, which is 25,000 per person by the injury, 50,000
per accident, and 25,000 for property damage.
Those limits have not been raised in 14 years from that standpoint.
What this bill does is on the first defense for someone convicted of DUI, and by the way
DUIs are up 43% since 2019, it would have to increase their limits to 50, 150.
If they have a second offense and their license are reinstated, those limits would go to 100,
300, 100, 100.
And they have to carry those limits for three years.
Florida in 2007 passed legislation for DUI and their first
offense is 100, 350 on the first go.
And so this is kind of a middle ground.
But what's happening today is that our cars are worth so much
more than it really are today.
25,000 just does not get it done.
And the medical is also there.
And this is just a simply a bill for those people who are
convicted of DUI.
It will require them to raise their limits.
OK.
Thank you, Senator.
Don't see any questions.
Whoops, I'm sorry, excuse me, proteam has a question, excuse me.
I have a quick question, thank you for your bill.
Would this also apply if you were driving under the influence of drugs?
I believe both drugs and alcohol are going to be addressed the same way, as I understand
the drug side, especially with some of the marijuana issues, you just have to show that
you have it in your body, it does not matter about the level of how much is in there.
Okay.
We have one more question. Chairman Hawkins, did you have a question?
Thank you, Chairman. I think this is a good bill. We heard it at the insurance, but I hope
the senator will come back again next year and raise that 50 to 125,000 right now.
I wouldn't cover a pick and fence. So I think we'll look forward to more work on this
one from you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, sir. I don't see you more questions.
thank you. Senator? Good to have you with us.
I'd be with Mr. Chairman and the committee members.
I'm very important to Senate Bill 88. Just as a fourth judge to the Douglas Judicial Circuit,
Douglas County ranked number two on the list for a new judge and it's in the budget and
ask for your favorable consideration. Okay, you don't see any questions. Thank you, sir.
Mr. Chair, members of the committee, bring before you, Senate Bill 51, near the top of
the second page, relates to the qualification-based selection of architects and engineers.
Simply take the time-tested process in which architects and engineers are hired by the
federal government and by all state agencies in the plaza to city and county governments.
Thank you, I don't see any questions.
Senator Cowson.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I bring with us today on page 2, Senate Bill 98.
This is an agency bill for the Department of Community Health and Aging Services Division.
When we revised the guardianship codes a few years ago, we provided that a county guardian
would be the guardian of last resort if a person that was a minor or an incapacitated adult
needed a guardian and it wasn't a family member or a close friend of some sort to serve
in that role.
The county would appoint the county guardian.
We omitted to put in a county conservator, conservator handles the assets of an incapacitated
personal and minor versus the major lifetime decision.
So when you have an elderly person with dementia
and they have assets that need to be maintained
and preserved in their expenses paid,
we didn't designate the county guardian,
do that role, this designates a county conservator
where the guardian applies in the code
just so we can be clear there'll be somebody
to protect our aging population.
Okay, thank you Senator, don't see any questions.
Thank you for them.
Senator Walker.
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and House colleagues.
Good to see you all this morning.
I've spoken to Senate Bill 35 once before, Mr. Chairman,
but it simply gives Georgia homeowners more time
to get notification if their homeowners insurance
is being non-renewed.
Currently they're required to give 30 days notice of a non-renewal. This would change that for the insurance companies to have to give 60 days notice.
Okay, don't see any questions.
Thank you sir.
Yes sir, Senator.
Mr. Chairman, committee, I have Senate Bill 110, this is basically the free range bill
that basically addresses and changes the definition of the lack to allow for more personal responsibility
of parents to manage their kids.
And I'll chill.
Okay.
No questions.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Okay.
Any members of the committee have a request?
Don't see any. Okay. Let's set a calendar for today. This will be under modified structure.
