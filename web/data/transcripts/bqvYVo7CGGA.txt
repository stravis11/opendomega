TRANSCRIPT
----------
Hello and thank you very much for being a part of Black midwife day at the
State Capitol under this golden dawn. You know so many of us believe it or not
who are sitting house and senate members were delivered at midwives or we've
touched a midwife my grandmother and my great-grandmother right here in Georgia
were midwives. But they helped so much and so much more needed now than ever
before. That's why I was happy to introduce legislation. Senate Bill 546. Senate
Bill 546 and it is moving on the Senate side and I'm so happy to work with the
legislators from the house side, namely Representative Park Cannon, who has
all so been working on this, and you are part of the profession. And it is a
profession, and we do have so many midwives who can deliver our babies,
especially in times like this with so much COVID and other pandemics to just
pop out of nowhere. We need professionals who love us and who won't to care for
us and deliver our babies. So I'm going to yield to Representative
Cannon for her great work that she's doing on the house side but you know it
takes the house and the Senate to come together to make a law and that's what
we're doing, working together for the best of women and children all over the state of
Georgia.
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator James.
Thank you to everyone who has been a part of the planning and the execution of Black
Midwife's Day in Georgia.
We are a part of a number of states across the country on today being clear that Midwifery
is a sacred profession and a practice
that should be legal in all of our states.
As we stand here in Georgia,
we are doomed with the fact that mothers and babies
are not facing safe experiences in hospitals.
And even if they are experiencing safe experiences
in hospitals, they have the understanding
that there is just something more culturally appropriate,
that there is something better about the home birth experience
or possibly a birth center experience
or even a hospital experience with a midwife,
which is why today we are talking about
the important statistics related to black midwifery.
And I am so proud to be standing here
with George's longest serving midwife,
Ms. Um Salama, who continues to share with us
these staggering statistics.
In 2023, the number of midwifery-attended births
rose from 9.6% in 2016 to 11.9% in 2021,
and it has estimated that an increase in midwifery
led to the decrease in stillbirths by 26%.
The decrease in maternal deaths by 41%
and the decrease in neonatal deaths by 39%.
Whereas the institution of midwifery
has a huge debt to pay to the legacy
of black, granny midwives in this country.
We know the history.
African women who were forcibly kidnapped and enslaved
upon their arrival in this country
brought with them the traditions and healing of midwifery.
And prior to the Civil War, these midwives were responsible
for bringing the babies of enslaved women into the world
as well as the babies of their slave masters.
After emancipation, many of these midwives
continue to practice within their communities
and became known as granny midwives.
They were prominent in southern states,
including South Carolina, North Carolina, Alabama,
Louisiana, Tennessee, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Texas,
Florida, Missouri, Arkansas, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and our state right here,
Georgia. And during that period, Granny Midwives attended more than two-thirds of Blackbirds.
In those states, we know that in 1930, there were 3,000 registered midwives in Georgia,
but unfortunately, those numbers have significantly declined for a multitude of reasons.
We have continued to see there be legislative action to make training and licensing a requirement
to practice midwifery, but we know that many black midwives who have been paramount to
providing maternal and infant health outcomes did not actually need those certifications
in order to have safe deliveries.
And in fact, when the work they do that is low risk, they continue to make up the midwifery
midforce of certified midwives, certified nurse midwives, are actually only seven percent.
So we know the importance of fixing the maternal and infant health disparities that exist.
We must engage in the word St. Kofa.
word from Ghana that means go back and get it, go back and retrieve it and be with it meaning the
legacy of African midwives, traditional midwives and granny midwives. So it is our honor as House
Incident today to honor this rich legacy and to present the 2024 Black Midwives Day Resolution
to you, George's incredible honor, Umselama.
Thank you so much. You are welcome. You are very welcome.
And at the same time that we celebrate in moving midwifery forward,
I have to think about last session when the house presented a resolution,
House Resolution 559 to Charles Johnson. Charles Johnson lost his wife Kira to internal
hemorrhaging after a C-section at a hospital. He started the organization for Kira for moms which
is a nonprofit dedicated to improving birth outcomes. He has been here with us advocating for the
issues he brought their surviving children of him and his wife Kira. I'll hold the photo
of him up here as to the time he spent with us in the house and I will invite Karina Edwards,
a midwife here in Georgia who works with the Safe Motherhood quilt to receive his resolution
and to provide a few remarks before returning it back to Senator James we're closing.
Thank you, Representative Cannon, thank you, Senator James, for all your work and support.
The Safe Motherhood Quilts is something that was started in the 80s, and midwife, Fimey
Gaskin, had found it, and she began to do a lot of research where she would question
every death because a lot of the mothers that were dying were dying from the use of
side attack. We're dying from cardiac arrest, which everybody dies from cardiac arrest.
So it was sort of a head scratching moment of why is this happening? And instead of just
taking the word from the doctor, you know, she would, she did some investigating. She
would try to talk to the family. She would talk to the medical examiner in the corner.
She would talk to the hospital attorneys because, you know, they would write one thing
down and then the hospitals would make a decision of what that cause of death was and
then by the time it got to the families, a lot of the families didn't even know.
And so Charles Johnson has been really advocating and pushing for laws nationally to help improve
just the communication and the accountability of these care providers in these hospitals
and the checkbox, as far as how did this mother actually die?
What led to her death?
And you know, Kier Johnson, she is one of the mothers
that is honored on the Safe Motherhood quilt.
The mothers that are dying, you know, at the end of the day,
it doesn't matter what your socioeconomic status is.
It doesn't matter what your level of education is.
A lot of the practices that are happening
is what's leading to a lot of the mothers dying.
And so Charles Johnson, again, you know, after losing his wife to such a horrible, negligent death, has been fighting on behalf as well as several of the community midwives and others to just try to help shift things and make it so that women can live through birth.
Black women can live through birth.
All women can live through birth.
And thank you again for recognizing Black Midwives Day
and for supporting this work.
Awesome.
Senator James.
Well, as a mother of two sons, I did not have the opportunity
to have midwife.
But I regretted it for many, many years
because all of my sisters who did have births with midwives
are healthy and their babies were healthy.
And so I wish that I had had an opportunity
to have mine delivered by midwife.
But I'm here now to fight for the mothers
because mothers are not dying in the care of black midwives.
They know the culture.
They touch us emotionally as well as physically.
and they care for us and our babies,
who are really trusted by the community too.
So let us continue to recognize the importance
of the legacy of black midwives and all midwives
throughout the state of Georgia.
So today we thank you for listening to us
and let us continue to change the laws
because this should not even be a topic of conversation.
It should already be done.
So together we stand.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We would love to answer any questions or.
You want to hear some more.
Yeah, so we're actually joined by another representative
and her guest, who is Azula.
And so we would like to invite them up.
At this time, we have another midwife who is also is here.
So we just wanna add to the space
and have you come stand with us
and representative Glaze will let you go ahead
and present that resolution.
Thank you.
Well, thank you.
And I'd like to say I'm standing for mothers in Georgia,
but particularly black mothers, as I am a mother,
two sets of twins, two pregnancies
that could have ended in my children not being here
and even myself.
but I had insurance, and doctors, and family around
to make sure that I was supported for the nine months
that I carried my twins and was on bed rest.
So that gives me the idea from the cup half full,
making sure that we leave nobody behind
and that doulas and midwives have been
and are the bedrock in our communities
for making sure that our women are healthier during their perinatal period all the way to a year
after their children or child has been born. So in House District 67, which I am the representative,
Lydia Glaze, we do hereby command and recognize Mayor Teresa Thomas Smith, who is the first African
American and first female mayor of the city of Palmetto. But more importantly we
recognize her as the mortality, the mortality, the women's mortality, queen of the
district of 67 because of her work as a doula. And I would like her to say just a
few words. Yes, thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you for this opportunity. I would
I'd like to say this work is serious work
and not a single person that is standing here
chose the work, the work chose us.
There's so many mothers that do not have anyone to speak.
I had amazing birth experiences,
but when I heard the stories of my sisters and daughters
and I don't mean the ones that I birth,
I mean the ones that I shared the human experience with,
when I heard the things that were happening to them,
I also heard the cry of the God that I served
and said, it's your turn to pour back the things
that the gifts that I've put into you,
give them back to the sisters and daughters
that do not have anyone to speak on their behalf,
that do not have anyone to advocate,
that literally just do not have anyone.
And I don't think people know how many people
go into the birth experience with no one at their side.
That's right.
That's why midwives and dolas are so important
to the experience and to the mothers that are having babies.
So I am grateful that I heard the calling.
I'm grateful that I was courageous enough
to answer the calling.
And I extend myself to those that need support
whether on either side of the birth experience,
mothers, fathers, and families,
because we represent and support the entire family
holistically and not just the mother and the baby.
So thank you for this opportunity.
Thank you for championing this cause.
Thank you for recognizing that we are a unit
and we are stronger together.
And we can do this when we all come together to do this.
So thank you very much.
Thank you.
You're welcome there.
All right.
And in percent, thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Good cake for us.
