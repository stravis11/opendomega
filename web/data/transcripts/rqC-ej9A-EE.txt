TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good morning. This is the uh
subcommittee on transportation
appropriations uh meeting uh jointly
with the uh transportation uh policy
committee. So appreciate everybody being
here. Feel free committee members to
move up to the front where the packets
are out on the table if you don't have
one in front of you. They're on the
first three rows or first two rows it
looks like. appreciate our staff uh
David and Danny getting those making
those available to all of us. And um
like I said, I'm John Leood, chair of
the subcommittee on appropriations. Uh
good to be with you. We're going to hear
presentations today uh from the DOT and
uh and SERTA
and uh I've got uh chairman Rick
Jasper's uh with us and I'm going to ask
him to uh if he has any remarks
>> just real quickly. Thank you members for
being here so early. Thank you chairman
Le Hood for putting us together. I know
it'll help Russell Janine with their
time not have to come to another
committee meeting if we go ahead and
knock this out. I just want to recognize
uh we have a DOT board member, Joe Stein
from for South County. Joe, you stand up
so they can see and welcome you being
here this today.
And members, I want to also let you
recognize Danny Nichols.
Danny's right down here on the end. You
can stand up so they can see you. You
know, she's our policy analyst, you
know, this year and we're glad to have
her. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. back to
you.
>> Thank you, chairman.
>> Thank you, chairman. Uh I second what uh
Chairman Jasper has said. Uh you know,
we lost Abby Day, who was had been here
for uh for I I had to call her out.
Yeah,
>> she was a wealth of knowledge to me as
my first year in this this role last
year, but uh but Danny and uh David have
really picked the ball up and I don't
think we skipped a beat. Abby, you you
prepared us all very well. So, thank
you. Uh we will go ahead and get
started. We have an hour. Uh we're
already seven minutes into it because
rules is meeting in here at 9ine. So uh
Commissioner McMurray, if you'll go
ahead and come up and uh present your uh
show us your presentation
to both chairman, thank you for
combining this. We do appreciate that.
Nothing like efficiency. So thank you
all for pulling this together. But I do
want to take a point of privilege just
for a minute to thank the women and men
of God do and of all state government in
fact for the work that's been going on
since uh last Thursday to Friday where
we started getting ready for this winter
weather and u and uh they did a
fantastic job. Dedication and commitment
of the men and women of GA is just
outstanding. Uh we had people that left
home on Friday morning and uh some of
those are just going back home today. Uh
so uh we bring up our crews from Tiffan
and Jessup districts. Uh anytime there's
a winter weather event across metro
Atlanta, they come up and they're
they're actually, you know, uh brining
and plowing the interstates here in
metro Atlanta and our other districts
work our way north. So uh they did a
fantastic job. I've yet to get the final
numbers, but we put over two two million
gallons of brine out and uh at one point
we were about 3,500 tons of salt, 2500
tons of aggregate spread and again 12
continual 12-hour shifts. This morning,
there's still I believe uh as of the
report I had this morning, I think seven
state routes that are still closed at
some point. Those hardest hit counties
still are Haberssham, White, Union
Towns, Raen, sort of that northeast
Georgia corner. U we call it the Golden
Triangle from where I'm from. A
beautiful place, but still uh still
dealing with that power lines, trees and
power lines, but uh working to get those
roads open. And also a big shout out to
our GEMA team who leads they're the
quarterback GEMA for leading this and
the Department of Natural Resources and
Georgia Forestry Commission for their
chainsaw strike teams. they've been
working very hard to get the trees out
of the road so we could uh get the roads
cleared out. So, just wanted to
acknowledge that. Uh what I want to do
today is uh walk you through some
important data points uh relating to
transportation and the cost of doing
business because we really need to
understand those cost as it informs us
in the budgeting process. And I want to
also share some of the uh outputs and
some of the outcomes from a couple of
two budget years. the current budget
year and last budget year to show you
how we're deploying the resources that
you have afforded us when you approve
the budgets. And then finally, I'll just
jump into this budget this uh amended
budget year FY amended FY26.
And when I spoke here to joint
appropriations, I talked about
acknowledging some realities. So, one of
the realities I need to acknowledge is
what's happening on the federal front
because the federal funding to Georgia
DOT is still very important at somewhere
around 1.5 to 1.6 billion a year and we
all know that the federal budget year
begins on October 1st. Uh, and I think
you everybody is aware at the federal
level that we're operating under a
continuing resolution to January 30th.
And when we walk when we work under
continuing resolutions federally, the
way it hap the way the money flows from
the federal government is they give you
a daily prata share of your total
budgeted amount. And so you get 100 one
365th share for the days to get us
through January 30th. Well, that's
really not a way to run a business
because when we do a project, we need to
fully fund a project. I can't daily give
a daily pro prorated share to a project.
Now I think everybody has seen at
Congress uh last week the house passed a
mini bus that had four big budget
programs in it and uh that included the
US Department of Transportation which
has the federal funding in it. Uh that
did pass the house. I think you've seen
the headlines recently. Uh the Senate
seems to maybe want to decouple one of
those budget programs out of that mini
bus that's passed. And so uh I'm not
sure what that means, but it means we're
getting really close to Sep I mean to
January 30. Uh and if it doesn't happen
then there potentially again a a
government shutdown or the stop of
money. Uh so we're watching that very
closely. The other thing we do every
year is the federal government allows
you to do a IOU. And so basically, you
can pay it forward with a Georgia dollar
and when the federal budget passes, the
federal government will reimburse you
for the money that you expend it. They
they they approve everything along the
way except the money. They just say,
"Here's an IOU." And it when we get to
this point of the calendar year, we pay
it forward to keep projects moving. We
want to keep projects moving as fast as
we can and not delay projects, but we're
using our state budget to do that. And
at this point of the year, we've used
and consumed our state budget, which
should be federal uh in our state budget
to do state funded projects. So, we're
about to we don't want to get ahead of
our skis and uh expend all our money uh
waiting on the federal dollar. So, it
gets to be a tricky point of delivery.
Very complicated budgeting process. uh
uh certainly accounting process, but
just wanted to highlight that because if
there's a shutdown at this point or this
gets delayed more, it will impact our
ability to advance projects either uh
design right away and certainly for
construction phases on federally funded
projects. Uh, so if that's not good news
enough, on this next slide, I'm going to
take you a deep dive early in the
morning into some into a chart here that
I've I've shown I've shown both the uh
subcommittee and the transportation
committee over the last few years and
it's really the the inflationary costs
related to transportation. So this
chart, this complicated chart comes from
Federal Highway Administration and the
red line tracks actually the cost of
doing business from around the nation
for highway construction. So they index
the cost of highway construction from
actual bid data from every state. And so
you can see that's the red line and
since 2021 it's increased by about 70%.
So the index has gone up 70%. So you can
say there's 70 it cost 70% more on
average across the nation uh than it did
in 2021. The CPI that we all everybody
you know knows about and understands is
that blue line. So I think it's pretty
staggering when you see what CPI is
doing compared to what the cost of
construction is. The other index here is
the dashed sort of yellow line across
the bottom. Sort of gold maybe sort of
orangey looking. That's the employment
cost index. So that's another index of
the cost of employment. And then the uh
green line is called the producer price
index which is a key indicator for
inflation uh based on the production of
level of goods uh like from mining,
manufacturing and agg. So those again
are sort of an indicator. But what's
interesting about this is you can see
that the red line, the highway
construction cost index outpaced all
those others, especially from about 2022
on on. So what does that mean locally
here in Georgia? Uh we're we're probably
a little better than average on a few
things and worse than average that red
line on some. And let me just talk
through a couple of those. This is this
chart looks back to FY21 to FY25.
And just simple resurfacing a two-lane
road has increased in cost by 51%. So
right now to do a two-lane road, it's
about $251,000
a mile to do two lanes, one lane in each
direction. Widening from two lanes to
four lanes, either if it's urban or in a
rural setting, our actual low bid
pricing has increased 99% for urban and
about 90% for uh rural widening. So
basically doubled practically doubled in
cost over those last four budget years.
Roundabouts, we talked about
roundabouts. Uh Chairman Powell and I
were just talking about roundabouts. You
can see that they've increased by about
47% and we just we compare that to the
pave surface. Uh so you know over those
last four years in bridges, bridges are
important to everybody. I'm going to
talk more about bridges. Uh bridge
replacements increased by about 93%. So
you can just see in those four years
this really increased cost. Down at the
bottom of the small table at the bottom
is some of the breakouts of the
components of these projects such as
asphalt, aggregate, you know, storm
drain pipes, bridge beams, and
guardrail. And you can see they range
from 90% on pipes and things like that
to a low of about 35% for guardrail
metal. And uh that number actually has
come down. steel steel prices were
really high back began after co and uh
they have retreated some back. So again
I just show you this to show you as we
think think about budget is how far does
the money go, what are we using it for?
You can sort of see the realities of
that. This next chart is we took that
red line from that first chart I showed
you and then index the budget our state
budget compared uh over that same time
frame. And it's no surprise but
basically what I told you is the
construction costs have gone here and
our and our budget has increased thank
goodness for that uh over the years. Uh
so the the inflation nationally has
increased by for construction about 70%
our budget about 30%. So that gives you
the difference of the loss of buying
power if you will to do what we need to
do. So what does this really mean and
translate and I showed this at joint
appropriations uh and Janine Miller's
here who uh you'll hear from in a little
bit but working through the planning
process in her role as the planning
director we have to live in a four-year
physically constrained budget process of
physical constraint versus project. So
when project costs go up, what happens
is we have to take a project and move it
from the current year it's in to a ne to
the next year is usually what we do. And
so then when you do that, you just
pushed another project out of the next
year because you were already constrain
physically constrained. That that line
across the middle of those boxes is
physical constraint. So this increased
cost is just caused us to cascade
projects out. And I sort of joked around
at joint appropriation saying I'm pretty
sure each of your projects is the most
important project in the state in your
district more so than your counterpart
next to you. So uh y'all can debate that
later but uh I got a fill in your
projects number one. So it's never fun
when we have to come say tell you that
well we're having to shift your project
out a year or two uh and simply because
of the funding situation of these
increased cost uh with even again
increased revenue at the state level um
federal level is a whole another story I
won't get into at this moment but that's
sort of the process we have to go
through which is never fun and we of
course anything we can do to advance
projects sooner than later now here's
the good news story I want to go back
because again with a sincere thank you
uh to both the house and the senate and
the governor's budget the last two years
with the state general fund infusion in
amended 24 of uh $1.5 billion and $1
billion last year's amended budget. You
can see now that our budget line went
above the national highway construction
cost index for the last two, which means
we're we didn't lose ground that we
actually maybe gained a little bit of
ground on those last two budget years.
But the difference between there on 2020
to about 2023 where we're below means we
still have more projects uh ready to go
than we have budget for. But I just
can't say enough about those last two
budget years from leadership from the
House, Senate, and the governor to put
that money in the budget to do what it's
going to do. So, let me show you what
that money's done. Again, trying to set
the table as we look forward on the on
the amended 26 budget. We look back at
those amended budgets, uh, 24 and 25,
and this is where the money went. Uh,
$98 million went to airport aid. Uh we
always have about three times more
requests than we have funding for
airport aid. And so this was a big big
step. About half of that money though
went to a replacement airport down in
Griffin Spalding County that if we did
not have the money, the Federal Aviation
Administration was going to take back
their commitment of funding which was a
big part of that. So, we were able to
get secure that FAA funding and leverage
those state dollars and also do a
tremendous amount of work around our
local airports across the state. The
local roads funding is that money to
cities and counties that's Elmig like
that most of you are familiar with the
Elmig money. We send this money out by
formula to cities and counties based on
population and road map road miles 250
million and 265 million respectively
which basically double their LMIG amount
and again putting it in this budget
category called local roads admin uh
took away the match component because
LMIG has a statutory match component
either 10% if you're in a tier region
which many of you are in and if you're
not in a tier region it was a 30% but
the local roads admin did not require
match patch. We got that money out very
quickly in both years. Uh and most all
that money was used by cities and
counties for resurfacing. Again, state
of good repair. Their reality has been
the same as ours, increased paving cost.
The next uh bucket there is the freight
program which is a big program at 500
million each year uh which was a new
program uh that was stood up just a
couple of budget years ago coming out of
the freight uh and logistics plan that
we did which uh came through uh chairman
Jasper's committee and basically move
forward to establish a new freight
budget program for us. I'm going to come
back to that one in a moment. Uh, next
is the capital construction. Uh, 593 was
in amended 24 to address the very thing
I just showed you where we're had to
cascade projects out into the future
because we didn't have money. In fact,
out of that $593 million, we were able
to advance 44 projects. 25 of those
projects of the 44 were ones that were
just delayed that we we they were ready
to go. We just needed the money. And in
fact, when we did those 25 projects from
where they were budgeted at, we sped
them up by 40 project years. So if a
project was sitting in two physical
years out and we moved it in, we call
that two project years. So 25 projects
accelerate it by 40 project years, which
is amazing. And we know the longer you
wait, the more it cost as well. And we
also added 19 project phases that we
know we needed to be working on, but we
just didn't have money to get started.
So that's where that money went. capital
maintenance was 50 million and amended
24 to address that resurfacing numbers I
was telling you about it being 51% more.
Uh so that helped us there. And last and
very importantly,
um as I talking about Representative
Taylor just ago, the 200 million for
Hurricane Helen and Debbie cleanup and
the storms we had in southeast Georgia
went into our maintenance budget. And
without that money, we would absolutely
have been devastated in hurricane
cleanup. In fact, still I dealt with uh
talked to Columbia County just yesterday
where had a request from Columbia County
still deal we're still dealing with
those impacts or those costs that are
still out there. And as I told Joint
Appropriations, uh so far we've had
about $48 million from FEMA
reimbursement. And so it's it's you know
here we are a year a year and a year and
a half or so post that and still you
know working on reimbursement. So this
money was very very important. Now,
that's what you appropriate it and
that's where we're going to use it. Let
me show you how it's been utilized. The
maintenance money we've this is
expended. So, these are dollars in and
actually paid out to contractors. 100%
of that money has been done. The capital
construction that 593 69% of that outlay
has gone out, meaning work has been
done. And then the last two categories
are the freight that 500 million in each
year. As you can see, those numbers are
sort of lagging a little behind, but
there's a reason for that. Uh, again,
that was a new budget program, and we're
advancing a lot of projects there that
were freight ready. And then several of
the big ones on the next slide are what
I call the big three out of that uh are
projects that we will bid this calendar
year. So, these projects will come to
bid this calendar year. First one is
I16, which is roughly $516 million,
uh, which is a combination of amended 24
funds and amended 25 funds to widen 31
miles of I-16
from I95 there down in Savannah, at
least up to the Hyundai Meta Plant. Our
goal is to do a a variable, a fixed
price, variable scope contracting. So we
say this is how much money we have and
the contractor bids how far they can go.
So a very innovative way to try to make
sure we maximize these dollars. Uh as we
all know uh I16 has tremendous amount of
trucks 23% trucks in that area and we
know adding this third lane down there
will reduce uh delay by about 56% uh now
and in the future. So again, very
important for our economic uh economic
opportunity that comes out of the port
and everything that's moving that
freight moving up I16. So that's that's
one project. The next one is I95 uh four
$74 million to wide I95 from uh I16 to
South Carolina. South Carolina is
currently under construction to build
eight lanes on their side. We have six
lanes on the Georgia side. So, we're
sinking those up again with traffic
volumes down there that are continue to
expand and grow due to all the freight
uh commerce that comes out of the port.
And lastly, out of the big three is 135
million to complete the last segment of
State Route 96, which is that connection
from I75 to I16 south of Mon uh there in
Hston and Twigs County. We have this
project ready to bid. Uh it's uh the
about nine miles with a major river
crossing in there, too. So, those are
sort of the big three that consume most
of that freight budget. That's why those
numbers were lagging a little further
behind, but you can see that this
calendar year we'll be getting getting
that work out the door and uh seeing
those num seeing those dollars used.
Now, Mr. Chairman, let me get into the
amended 26 budget from the governor's
recommendation. And again, I'm uh super
uh excited and very grateful for the
governor putting in roughly $2.3 billion
of additional state general fund money
into the G DOT budget. And so, let me
walk through sort of the big buckets of
where that's going, starting with hund00
million to address rural bridge
replacements. And so, uh, we have
literally, uh, you know, hundreds of
millions, if not more, of bridge
projects that we know we need to do, but
we don't have the funding to do. And so,
this $100 million is going to be used
strategically to support a and timber
industry in the rural parts of the
state. So, we're going through the
process now of doing a triage of where
are these bridges? We're trying to make
sure they're tied directly to some a
production or some timber facility
production uh that we're replacing
bridges strategically. So, it's taken us
a little bit of time. I know I wished I
could give you the list of what that is
today, but we're working through that
because we're we're doing several saves
and analysis and saying, "Okay, what
does this one serve? What's this
bridge?" So, this will be a combination
of county bridges and state route
bridges, but really try to again uh
strategically advance those. And our
goal would be that we would deploy these
bridges either in this budget year or
next budget year to be bid, not put them
all out at one time, but make sure we
could be strategic about getting these
bridges $100 million of strategic bridge
investment out over the budget year and
next. Next is uh was 200 million to the
316 corridor. For the last six to seven
years, uh, we've been really focused on
trying to improve safety along State
Route 316 in Gwynette, Barrow, and Okone
counties, roughly 40 some odd miles, uh,
between Athens and sort of metro Atlanta
there in Gwynette. What we've been doing
is trying to address the the safety
concerns that exist, I'll get into that,
by replacing intersections that have
traffic lights with either interchanges
or overpasses or making some kind of
other access improvements along this
very critical corridor. And uh our focus
at first was where the traffic signals
are because that's where the most
congestion is. That's where you have a
lot of crashes. And so we've been
underway. And on this next slide, you
can sort of see all the intersections
from left to right. 30 32 some odd
intersections along 316 where the
traffic really varies greatly from about
almost 30,000 vehicles per day up to
108,000 vehicles per day with 12% of
those being trucks. So it is a freight
corridor. But the staggering number here
is there's about 1,300 crashes per year
on these on this segment. In our 10
years of data, we went back 10 years. So
there's there's been 65 fatal crashes on
this corridor in the last 10 years. If
you do that math, that's six and a half
per year. That is not where we want to
be. In fact, the crash rates, we look at
rates. So that sort of equalizes things
around the state. Uh six of the
intersections are in the top 50 worst
offensive intersections for crashes and
three more are in the top 100. So you
got nine out of the top 100 worst
intersection locations on this corridor.
And then the other thing we look at is
crash severity. So you have a crash, how
bad is it? So the most severe crashes,
the ones you don't want to have uh for
the intersections are higher than the
statewide average and one is double the
statewide average. So you can see the
the crash issue we're dealing with from
a safety point of view. The good news is
18 of those intersections are actively
being addressed or have been addressed.
Uh but this last $200 million, this $200
million would go a long way to continue
sort of the 12 to 13 remaining
intersections that we just really didn't
have funding for. If you look down at
the bottom right for the legend, I know
it may be hard to see, you have yet sort
of the yellow is intermediate and
long-term. The yellow intermediate means
that we may have like design underway,
but we didn't have construction funding
or rideway. The the black uh is
long-term, meaning it's just not funded.
So, you count those up, there's, I
think, 12 or 13 of those that this $200
million will absolutely allow us to
start addressing. So, we end up with a
core the entire corridor that is not
only improved safety, but also mobility
in a growing area, especially in in the
Barrow and Okone County areas.
Next out of the state general fund in
the governor's budget was the $250
million of local roads administration.
Again, that elmiglock money. Uh I can
absolutely tell you that I've heard from
ACCG and GMA. They're fully supportive
of this. Uh cities and counties and I've
had no city or county complain about
this money, by the way. So, I think you
got unanimous consent that everybody
likes cities and counties. Again,
they're they're facing the same
realities we face with increased costs.
And the other thing is we we get this
money out very quickly. We would open we
would open the portal as probably as
soon as the budget is passed and then
shut it off right before uh July 1 so
that the money is committed in this
fiscal year and the cities and counties
can have use of it immediately.
All right. Next, this is a really big
one. I shared this same slide at joint
appropriations. Uh these are state
general fund monies uh that is listed
under our budget item payments to SERTA.
You're going to hear from Janine Miller,
the executive director of SERTA in just
a little bit, who will provide a lot
more detail about some of the data
points on I75 South Express Lanes. But
what I can say about this is this
probably been the most po popular budget
item uh that I've heard about from many
of you and many of my friends uh from
the announcement the governor made at
Eggs and Issues. It appears that
everyone is really a big fan of this
project because I do think it has such
statewide impact. It affects everybody.
If you live south or north, uh it
affects you one way or another. You
know, I asked during joint
appropriations, uh, did everybody, did
anyone ever think the express lanes was
going in the wrong direction? And it got
a pretty big chuckle. Uh, so I'm
assuming that meant yes. Uh, but what I
can tell you when the direction that
they're going in, uh, most people
criticize us saying those lanes don't
look like they look like they should be
going the other way. Well, when you open
up two more lanes where it's two lanes
wide, you add it 67% more capacity,
which then makes the normal lanes look
more empty than they were because that's
the benefit of having those two
additional lanes. So, uh it's amazing to
see the difference and they are always
going the wrong direction from you if
you're going the direction when they're
not open. Correct. And oh, by the way,
it does take us some time to reverse
them. It takes takes an hour to two to
go through to make sure there's nobody
in them, make sure it's safe, and then
you have to flip them around. So, that's
something we have to deal with. Well,
this funding absolutely does some
critical things. It says on the slide,
it's going to one, we're going to get
rid of the directional the uh reversible
lanes and make two lanes barrier
separated, mind you. Meaning there's a
concrete barrier between you and the
other lanes the entire the entire 12
miles. that that's found foundationally
what this money is going to do which
gives us the money to do the design work
that we have to do to do the rideway
acquisition that we have to do the
environmental work that we have to do.
This will be a federal environmental
document uh and then it's going to go uh
to help support the overall construction
cost which will still need a form of
finance uh and through SERA and that
form of finance can come in many forms.
It can come through a US DOT tifia loan.
It can come from toll revenue bonds, but
it's going to take more money uh to do
this and uh to get that objective of two
lanes in each direction. Not only that,
um Chairman Hatchet asked, well, how far
will these go? And I'm not sure I
answered appropriately. I said Dublin's
probably a good place, but uh the point
is I think you all know that you get
stuck if you're coming north, you get
stuck down in Locust Grove at Bill
Gardner Parkway. That's where traffic
stops. And so we know that uh we need to
go further south with these express
lanes. So, this amount of money is what
we need as a minimum to make sure that
we can leverage to do two lanes in each
direction uh in the 12 miles, but also
like I mentioned on I16, we'll make it
very innovative that we're going to make
sure the money goes as far south as
possible to try to again because we know
you're stopping before you even have the
opportunity to get in the express lane.
So uh that's going to be our that's
going to be our uh tact and strategy uh
to do that. So um just again Janine will
have a lot more data points about how
the system operates today and the and
sort of the data behind it and we can uh
we can talk about that one a little bit
more uh after she does her
presentations. Now let me just jump into
the budget itself. So, you've got your
track sheet in front of you. Uh, and but
I before you get there, if you pull that
track sheet up, you're going to see the
total uh back on page three of the
amended budget. And so, I always like to
remind everybody in the amended budget
year, the $71.6 million increase in
excise comes from the audited
collections from last year's uh motor
fuel collection. So, that gets into our
amended budget. So motor fuel is uh is a
is uh forecast but then adjusted in the
amended year for the actual audited
collections from department of revenue
that comes into us. That's why there's
no change in transportation trust fund
fees or the transit trust fund fees and
the amended budget. Those two budget
items look back two years. What it takes
two-year look back is what we get
appropriated in the year. So those those
will be an adjustment next year. And the
state general funds $2.3 billion. I just
highlighted the biggest part of that.
But that shows you that brings our total
budget to $5.2 billion. Again, very
thankful for that state general fund
money. This table is sort of a summary
of what's on your track sheet. We've
aggregated a couple of those budget
programs together to show you where the
funding is actually used. And so I
always like to show this chart. Of
course, the payments to SERTA is the big
one there at 1.8. There's a few other
things in payments to SERTA beside the
1.796 billion. Then capital projects,
that's capital construction and capital
maintenance uh at $1.77 billion. Then
you have our routine maintenance budget.
That is that is hey that's snow and ice
right now but uh uh preparation and
response but that's the taking care of
the roadsides. I always say that's the
taking care of the house if you will uh
of doing that in including a lot of
maintenance contracting. that's our
staff but also a tremendous amount of
maintenance contracting to do what we
need to do. Then you can see the LMIG
and LRA uh combined there. Uh and then
our general operations of the department
which in this case we've aggregated many
budget programs together like department
admin traffic operations program
delivery administration planning and
data collection. So that that's sort of
run the department altogether. There is
some of the traffic operations that do
things. We have bond debt I'll talk
about in a minute. Uh we have our inter
modal which is aviation rail waterways
and um that's like aviation rail
waterways transit. Uh so that's that's
where that money is and then payments to
the ATL. So on the next slide if you
want to get your track sheet we've just
taken your track sheet and put it in
table tabular format here for the for
the presentation. Again, I want to start
by saying a big thank you for the
governor for recognizing the one-time
payment of $2,000 for state employees.
Uh we certainly appreciate that. I'm not
going to go line through line on those
items, but that totals about 8.6 million
to G dot across all the budget programs
where people are and that is so
appreciate it. We really do appreciate
that. So, let me start at the top of
this table and I'm just going to
highlight a few things. Uh the geo bond
debt I think it's very important to talk
about. The good news is you can see that
was about a million $1.1 million
reduction in bond debt meaning that our
debt is reduced uh for geo bond debt but
our total bond debt or excuse me our
total debt from various kind of bonds is
still $1.13 billion. So we still have a
pretty good credit card balance there
that we're paying down from previous
bond packages. So I just want to make
sure you're aware of that. Next is
capital construction. And I'm going to
highlight that one because again that's
where that's where things get built. Uh
that increased excise number that you
saw on the last slide, we put 36.9
million of that into the capital
construction. And then the other plus up
was to 200 million in state general fund
money uh for 316. So that that increased
that $236 million ad that circle. The
next circle there is capital
maintenance, which is line 47.3
uh on your track sheet. Uh in capital
maintenance, uh there's the $100 million
added for the bridge replacements uh
rural bridge replacements I talked
about. We'd uh asked for your support to
actually get that in budget alignment
with the capital construction program.
So if we could shift that up into the
capital construction program, that would
be in alignment with the budget uh
requirements there. Uh and then uh that
was the big change there. Uh
where we put that into capital
maintenance. Uh going down to LMIG. Uh
LMIG is a minimum of 10% of the excise
tax. So with the increased excise for
motor fuel collections, we made that $7
million adjustment to the Elmig program.
And then of course the big circle there
is local roads admin that I've already
talked about at $250 million.
If you want to jump on your track sheet
over to line 47 um
two um or so uh then you can see routine
maintenance. I want to talk about that
again. Very important. uh taking care of
the house as I said uh we increased took
some of the excise 21.8 8 million of the
X size we added into routine maintenance
just to deal with the increased cost.
Same those increased costs on
construction go right into maintenance.
It's the same materials and also to help
with some of our equipment uh keeping
our equipment up to date uh as it ages
out. And so that's where that's going
and plus some money for the $2,000
supplement. Uh so that that gives us the
$26 million ad in routine maintenance.
Lastly, circled there is payments to
Serta that we've talked about as it
relates to the I75 South Express lanes.
So, with that, uh, both chairman, thank
you for this opportunity. Again, I want
to thank Governor Kemp for his continued
third year in a row for leadership of
increasing the transportation
investment. Uh, that absolutely keeps
Georgia moving ahead. Uh, trying to keep
our stance of the number one state to do
business going on the 13th, try to go
for the 13th year in a row. And this uh
additional funding absolutely will make
lives better for Georgians all across
this bath state not just in metro
Atlanta but across the entire state. So
with that be glad to entertain any
questions. Uh at your pleasure.
>> Thank you uh commissioner. Very thorough
report u and appreciate you stewarding u
you know the these resources for the
state and keeping us safe on the road
and uh 2.4 billion dollars added to your
amended budget. That's a lot. Yes, sir.
uh and uh most of it looks like it's
going to the u express lanes and uh
we're we're a little bit tight on time
so we're going to be brief on the
questions and just ask you to be
available to the committee you know.
>> Yes sir. afterwards. But uh if you could
just explain you briefly um the the
express lane the original project when
was that when was the peach length the
uh express lanes put in and um how does
it relate to today's u this new project?
>> Yeah. So thank thanks for that question.
Um it was bid in 2013 and opened in
2018. Seems like yesterday, but it's
been it's been a minute. So, uh, going
on eight years this summer, uh, being
open, uh, the original cost, uh, was
pretty good bargain as, uh, about $216
million sort of all in. Uh, but I remind
you that what we had then was a median
that we basically filled in. Uh, and
there was only a couple of over there
was one interchange overpass, uh, that
was redone and one bridge over I75 that
had to be redone. Everything else
squeezed in. So, uh, so you go back to
those numbers and you say, "Wow, why
can't we why can't we do it for that
cost?" Well, I look back at the that
national highway construction cost index
nationally. Uh, and uh, over that time
from 2013 to 2024, there was 111%
increase in construction cost. Now, if
you multiply that out, it's still south
of the total dollar amount, but these
are two very different projects of what
we are trying to eventually accomplish.
Uh, again, where that we've already
filled up the median that means we're
going to have to go to the outside, buy
a rideway, you know, do more
construction, and then I remind you too,
the south end of that project is only
one lane and it's squeezed in the middle
and it's only one lane wide. So, we're
going to have to do be very innovative,
which means probably more bridges, more
aerial to limit rideway impact on a very
constrained corridor. You get into more
bridges, high level kind of things, fly
bridges that fly over and back into the
middle. So, our goal is again to use the
existing rideway and real estate we
have. And there's some wide areas there
at Eagle Land Eagle's Landing, Hudson
Bridge down uh sort of on the south
side. There's some there's some or
excuse me on the northern side there's
some wide rideway that we absolutely
will use, but there's a lot that will
just be re total interstate
reconstruction. It' be a very complex
>> and if I understand right, the 1 roughly
1.8 billion added to the amended budget
is just getting you started. Uh you
there there will be more money borrowed
and that debt will be serviced through
the fees. Correct.
>> That's correct.
Okay, chair Jaspers, do you have
anything for the commissioner?
>> You know, I know you you're y'all got
your guys are very available to us. I
know a lot of members have get texted
questions, but one that comes up the
most, commissioner, is on resurfacing
and you know, it's what we all in here
see every day. We get the complaints
about and I guess what is the pent up
demand? I know that we check our roads
every other year. We know the grade of
them and you know we got increased money
for paving but I think members want to
know what's the demand because you know
I would I'm always trying to ask for
more money and sometimes don't have real
accurate numbers but I'd sure like to
know what's demand. I don't know if you
can answer that right now.
>> Yeah I let me let me give you sort of
just a ballpark answer there is I go
back to that data point of resurfaces
increased by 51% over the last four
years. So, we we got I think you'd agree
that most of our conditions are pretty
good. We've we've sort of we have we
have key performance indicators for all
our roads and we're we're almost hitting
some of the targets. Uh some of the
targets we're right on. So, we're we're
sort of close to where we need state of
good repair in a system, but that we got
there
several years ago. So if you've got if
your money is going half as far, that's
going to tell you that's about what we
need. So on average, we're somewhere
around 370 to $400 million a year to
resurface state routes and interstates.
The sort of the other concern though is
our interstates. I like to say all of
them are uh have a knee replacement, a
hip replacement, and and are eligible
for social security. A lot of the
original interstate pavement has lived
its life and we're having to spend
significant amount of money. Just as a
word of warning, we are rebuilding I I
285 from the airport on the west side up
to Cobb County up through Cobb County
this summer. So don't go don't go over
there. All right.
Stay away.
>> Yeah. And and but the point the point is
it's that pavement is worn out. We're
having to rebuild it. But I think that I
think the antidotal answer is pretty
easy. 51% cost increase. We were pretty
good on our state of good repair sort of
where we are but that means you about
need to double the budget right I mean
so you need you need that you know where
we are 375 or 400 you probably need to
be like you know 800 million a year.
Thank you,
>> Commissioner. Appreciate you. And
members, uh I'm sorry we're just short
on time. So, I'm going to uh ask uh
director of planning Janine Miller to
come up and uh give us her presentation
and and probably just hit the highlights
so we can make best use of this last 10
minutes.
>> Yes, sir.
>> I've got a lot of data points, but I
will go through them quickly.
>> Good morning. It is great to be with you
all here today. Thank you for your time.
uh and your attention to to
transportation which uh we know is the
arteries of our economy of our
communities uh and our families. Uh
quickly uh the SERTA budget
the 2026 budget included money for the
infrastructure bank as it does every
year through the transportation trust
fund. Um we are uh excited to have uh
reported that we have awarded all of
those dollars to 13 projects around the
state uh including uh the northwest
corner Cherokee and Cumberland C around
uh Truist Ballpark to support movement
there around that economic center all
the way down to Seol County uh and the
and Iron City there as well as Twin City
and Emanuel County and up and over to
Athens Clark County. So we have been
able to award 13 projects around the
state uh thanks to your investment
there.
We also have our current round is open.
So there is a card on your desk uh with
with a QR code there for your local
communities to apply for for those
dollars uh through February 13th. So
would love to get more applications uh
from around the state again this year.
As the commissioner said, I'm going to
talk about the I75 south corridor, but I
always have to start with in
transportation uh our logistics enabled
uh businesses. Since Governor Kemp took
office, there have been 113 billion
dollars of in announcements in of
private investment throughout the state
and 88% of those announcements have been
in logistics enabled companies. In other
words, there is a requirement for
inbound cargo for the company to operate
and employ Georgians and outbound goods
to market uh and consumers. 74 billion
or 65% of the total dollar amount that
is uh over the past six seven years um
has gone towards logistics enabled
businesses employing overtime as these
uh projects roll out 157,000 jobs
throughout the state. So this is a
critical uh a critical industry for for
the state of Georgia that relies on our
transportation system all day every day.
I want to talk about congestion in metro
Atlanta. I think you all have probably
felt it uh if not on your way to and
from the capitol here but but throughout
the year. In fact, last year the most
recent publication of a a a company
called Enrich, this is a world-renowned
data analytics company with for
transportation ranked Georgia as number
seventh in the country for worst trans
worst uh traffic and delay. That is 16th
in the world is Atlanta. Uh that's
incredible. That's a 23% increase in the
hours lost to traffic in the past two
years. The third most increase in the
US. And the other state, the other metro
areas that had worse traffic growth than
Atlanta were Baltimore and Philadelphia,
and those were for one-time events. You
may recall that the unfortunate uh uh
bridge collapse in in Baltimore caused a
great deal of congestion there, as well
as there were um issues with the
Philadelphia's transit system, uh
safety, significant safety issues that
shut that down. Were it not for those
very unique one-time events, Atlanta
would have had the worst traffic growth
in the country since 2023. Last year,
uh, people sitting in Atlanta traffic
lost 75 hours. That's 50% higher than
the US average.
What does that look like on our
roadways? In the on the left is red to
green. Since 2019,
uh, we have had basically the population
of the city of Newark, New Jersey moved
to metro Atlanta and the roads got
worse. Uh, some of them got better.
They're in green on the left, but all
the rest of them got worse. On the
right, you can see the degree to which
they got worse. And this corridor, I75
in the in south metro area, the lifeline
to northern Georgia uh through metro
Atlanta, uh had the worst traffic. And
this is midday. This is middle of the
day. This is not rush hour. Uh and these
are the times as the commissioner
mentioned when we are reversing the
direction of the lane.
Uh express lanes are a choice, great
choice for metro Atlanta or anyone
traveling through Georgia. Uh since 2011
when we opened the I85 corridor, we have
had uh significant growth. In fact, in
the last two years since we've gotten
that those uh really bad traffic numbers
and data, we've had a 12.6% increase in
the use of our express lanes. That's
systemwide. A little zoom in here on the
I75 south corridor, 5 million trips. Uh
we've had an 84% growth in trips since
fiscal 18 when it opened. It is
currently 12 miles long, although as the
commissioner said, it's um only two
miles uh for uh for portions of it and
one lane in each direction for a couple
of miles on the south. This is what it
looks like to to the the uh average
traveler who's doing a Google map
search. How long is it going to take me
to get through the corridor? In the
morning, northbound, the lane is going
in the northbound direction. And using
the toll lane, it would take 10 to 16
minutes to get through there. 80%
increase, though, if you're trying to
get through that corridor in the
afternoon. And you you might say, well,
10 minutes is not that big of a deal.
Well, actually that lane provides a
would have would provide a 21 mph
increase in speed through that corridor
if that lane were going in the
northbound direction. And you multiply
this, this might just be what you see on
your phone uh for your trip, but you
multiply this by the number of people
every day who cannot get into the lane.
Uh average about a 100,000 people every
day who cannot get in to the express
lane.
So we have a uh have something in uh in
transportation analytics. This is how it
looks to us as transportation
professionals professionals. A road
report card levels of service. It's it's
an A, B, or C, you're doing well. If
you're an F, you are failing. And this
uh these general purpose lanes are
failing Metro Atlanta uh travelers. And
by 2050, this is all day. Do you see
that red? All day long. This is an all
day model. There is not a way to get
through this corridor at any hour of the
day in 2050 uh with uh with any ease or
speed.
That is all what we can predict. But of
course we cannot predict crashes. So
compound onto those data points uh the
growth in traffic and the delay. What is
caused the by the slowdowns that are
caused by unpredictable crashes is is
quite severe throughout this corridor
particularly on the northern side. So
there is no way to get around these
crashes when the lane is going in the
other direction.
Uh by the numbers, this is the real
data. Okay, this is the roll up of a
most recent month of data we were able
to to gather in December of 2025. Time
and money lost uh by the numbers.
193,000 average vehicles per day. That
is 334,000
vehicle hours of delay in just the month
of December. uh every person lost 9.3
hours that month to traffic on that
corridor. And so you have to budget 80%
additional more time to get through that
corridor on schedule. And the cost to
the economy is real. 15.5 million is the
cost of that unreliability. But what's
very interesting is where those um cars
and trucks are coming from and going to.
the darker the gray, uh, the the more
trips originate and depend on that
corridor there in the center of the
state to get through. So, it's not just
the express lane, it's all of the
general purpose lanes that are dealing
with this traffic. And, uh, once we have
a lane going in both directions, there
will be 70% more vehicles that can pass
through this corridor. And I say
vehicles, it's not just cars. uh 18 to
20% of the vehicles getting through this
corridor, attempting to get through this
corridor, are trucks. They carry two
$620 million a day of freight value. In
a year, that's $226 billion. That is up
roughly 25%
of the value of freight moving in
Georgia goes through this corridor and
sits in that traffic.
This corridor has also been named by the
American Trucking Associations as the
worst freight corridor bottleneck in the
country. It's number 12. 1 through 11
are all interchanges. This is the number
one worst corridor in the country for
trucks.
director. Um we're getting some looks on
time at the back door and uh and rules
chairman has has come in and so we're
going to clear this room. But thank you
for that quick presentation and we may
we may ask you back uh to either this
committee or chairman Jasper to thank
you
>> so we can have time to ask you some
questions.
>> Thank you.
>> All right. Thank you. Hey, uh members,
if you would take your packets with you
when you go to
