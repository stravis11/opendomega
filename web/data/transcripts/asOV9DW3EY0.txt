TRANSCRIPT
----------
All right, good morning. We are here to say it plainly and simply. Stop playing politics with Georgia's children.
We call this press conference today because I and the folks standing with me are furious.
The by the reckless and callous decision by the Trump administration to freeze $6.8 billion in federal education funding.
funding. That includes critical support for after-school programs, summer learning, teacher
training, migrant student services, and English language learners. Here in Georgia, that
means we stand to lose nearly $100 million, including $40 million for after-school and
summer learning programs serving over 27,000 students. Right now, Fulton County Schools
has $6 million frozen.
Atlanta Public Schools has $5 million on hold.
The Boys and Girls Club of Metro Atlanta
is stuck waiting for nearly $2 million.
And that's just in my Senate district alone.
And why?
Because someone in the White House
is reviewing the funds for signs of
so-called radical left-wing agendas.
Let me be crystal clear.
There is nothing radical about ensuring our kids
can read, count, and grow into productive citizens.
Hence, my very first bill which was signed into law
focused on improving literacy.
Our school districts aren't pushing ideology.
They're focused on education and student success.
This kind of political theater may play well in DC,
but it's wreaking havoc and concern here in Georgia.
These programs are not radical.
They are essential.
You don't attack after school programs.
weeks before school starts unless you've never had to worry about how your child is getting
home or staying safe.
This isn't about politics, it's about 27,000 children, and the working parents who rely
on these programs just to survive.
This is an education issue, it's an economic issue, and it's a moral issue.
Afterschool programs allow parents to work, keep food on the table, and ensure their children
are safe and supported after school.
Without this funding, families, especially single parents,
will be forced to choose between earning a paycheck
and keeping their child safe.
Cutting these programs threatens to push our kids
into the School of Prison Pipeline,
and I won't stand for it.
So let's talk facts.
Every dollar invested in after school programs
saves taxpayers $2.64.
That's three to one.
This isn't just the right thing to do.
It's fiscally responsible.
I want to emphasize, school starts in less than a month
here in Georgia.
My own daughter begins her educational journey
on August 5th.
But apparently, someone in the White House
thinks school starts after Labor Day as it does up north.
It doesn't.
And this delay is creating panic and systems
that depend on consistency.
Many teachers are actually coming back to school this week.
These funds were already passed by Congress
and included in school budgets.
This isn't a policy review, it's sabotage.
So I'm calling on the Trump administration
and the office of OMB to release these funds,
stop playing games, and let Georgia's children learn
and districts prepare.
And I want to acknowledge that Superintendent Woods
has already called for the release of these funds.
I thank him for speaking out, and now I urge our governor
to do the same.
Stand with me, stand with superintendent woods,
and stand with the many colleagues from the House
and the Senate that are standing with me here today.
This is not a partisan issue, this is a people issue.
Georgia families can't wait.
Georgia kids shouldn't be used as political pawns,
and the future of 27,000 children is on the line.
And I promise you, we will not stop fighting
until every dollar is restored,
and every program is protected.
Thank you, and you will now hear
from voices directly impacted by these actions.
First, Julia Riggs, CEO of Wings for Kids After School program,
and then Keisha Spells, who is a parent
and Deshan Carter, Carton, Catron, I'm sorry,
who is a student and author.
Good morning, I'm Julia Rugg, CEO of Wings for Kids, and I'm joined here today by
Albert Nick Howard, our Director of Programs. Thank you, Senator Camp, for hosting this
event and for inviting Wings to share our story. Wings has been serving elementary school
age children through after-school programs for 28 years since 1996, and right here in
Atlanta since 2012. We've been through lots of ups and downs, but this is one of the
the toughest ones yet.
What we're dealing with isn't just a bureaucratic delay,
it's a crushing blow to the 600-plus students
that we serve each and every day
on a non-dropping basis.
For parents, we are providing safe, structured
after-school programs in opportunities
for them to be able to work.
For kids, we are providing school, home work help,
enrichment, field trips, trusting relationships
with mentors, and most importantly, positive social
and emotional skills so that our kids can succeed academically
and thrive in life.
And for teachers, we support school attendance.
I've had conversations with our principals,
and they tell us that without wings,
their school attendance drops by as much as 40%.
Without this funding, we're being forced to cut our services,
cut our hours, delay our programs,
and potentially even close our sites
where we are the only after school provider
in that community.
Right here in Atlanta,
five elementary school communities
are directly affected by this funding freeze.
That means hundreds of children in our city
and families in our neighborhood.
Mothers, fathers, grandparents are now scrambling
to figure out how to keep their children safe,
supported, and on track.
And let me just conclude by saying that in Atlanta,
it's the kids who are paying the price.
It's not Washington, it's not policymakers, it's our kids.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
I'm sorry you all, this is very near and dear to my heart.
My name is Keisha Spills.
I am the proud mother of four, a dedicated educator and the executive administrator for
the Lilly's Foundation for Change. As a working mom, having access to affordable
after-school care was essential while my children were in K-12. I need a safe
enriching environment where they could build friendships, explore new interests
and grow, while I served other students and families. Thankfully, organizations
like the Boys and Girls Club of Metro Atlanta, the YMCA, and the City of Atlanta's teen leadership
programs stepped in. These programs funded by state and federal grants were affordable options
that supported my children when I couldn't be there at the end of the school day.
Now, as nonprofit leader, I see how critical these services are from another perspective,
especially for grandparents raising grandchildren on fixed incomes.
The families we support at the Lilly's Foundation rely on these programs because they simply
can't afford them otherwise.
school care isn't just child care. It's exposure to leadership, entrepreneurship, the arts,
STEM, and more. It shapes young people into global citizens and future change makers.
Cutting, funding, or delaying it for these programs doesn't just hurt families,
it weakens communities across Georgia. Let's protect after school care. Our children and
in our future, depend on him.
Applause.
Good morning.
First, I wanted to extend my sincere gratitude
to Senator Roshan Kemp and his chief of staff,
Blake Robinson, for giving me the honor
to speak to you today.
My name is Deishan Katron.
a 16-year-old junior born and raised in the city of Atlanta.
I stand here not just as a children's book author or a youth advocate,
but as the product of the very programs that are now under threat.
Let me be clear, President Donald Trump's decision to sign
off on freezing federal funds from after school programs
in the state of Georgia is not just disappointing.
It's dangerous.
These programs were built to build, they
were built to bridge the gap between struggle and stability,
between vulnerability and opportunity.
When you take resources away from young people,
you don't just close a door.
You open another one, a door to the streets, to crime,
to desperation.
You're taking the young people that are struggling
to live, wait out, away.
Like I said in the beginning, I am born and raised
in the city of Atlanta.
I have almost been in every hood and needless to say,
I know what goes on.
It's not by coincidence that after school programs
are in our hood, they are there to make
the lives of the future generation better.
as Mayor Andre Dickens say, he wants to make Atlanta the best place to raise a child.
Meanwhile, stripping these programs of their funding will lead to a spike in crime weight
and God knows what else.
This is literally backed by history and statistics.
Kids who don't have a safe, structured environment after school or even during the summer are
more likely to get pulled into situations that can derail their futures. I know this because
I've lived it. I'm a proud product of the at Promise Center, the Boys and Girls Club
of Metro Atlanta, the Salvation Army, the City of Atlanta Parks and Wrecks and the
Atlanta Team Leader program. These programs gave me more than just a safe space to go to.
They gave me mentors, purpose, discipline, and most importantly, a vision for my life
that is beyond my circumstance.
They taught me how to dream and then how to work to make those dreams real.
Every book that I write, every child that I speak to, every young person that I mentor,
it is rooted in those programs that have poured into me.
I'm living proof that the after school program works,
that it saves lives, and that it changes futures.
And after school program, by helping one person,
might not change the world, but it might change the world
for that one person.
Well, I'm that one person.
And now, I dedicate most of my time
to reaching as many one persons as I can.
So I urge our state leaders, our community,
the Trump administration, and everyone that is listening
under the sound of my voice,
to please try your best to protect our kids,
protect their futures,
protect after school programs,
because those same after school programs protected me.
May God bless us all.
Thank you.
Well, I truly hope that what you all see today is that these are real consequences of
reckless decisions that continue to come out of Washington, D.C. and the Trump administration.
And I just want to thank all of my colleagues for joining here today to call on the release
of these funds, and with that, we'll take any questions that you may have.
We're good?
Oh.
I know that our governor and our president have conversations about choosing a Senate candidate,
So they absolutely have the connection to do what's right for Georgia's children and
have a conversation about releasing these funds.
We literally start school in weeks and in many cases teachers are literally coming back
to school this week.
And so we need these funds released immediately so that we don't continue to cause chaos
and wreak havoc in a time where we should be getting off to a great start in the school
for all the evolution of our relationship.
Yeah, I feel like Georgia and other states are being held hostage to a different agenda.
It's an agenda trying to find a problem.
And if they truly cared about children, they would release these funds.
And they can do whatever review they want.
I was speaking to Julia this morning about the work that they do after school programs.
They get audit it all the time.
So those funds could literally be released today and they can still continue to do whatever
witch hunt they're trying to find and make sure that children and teachers are well prepared
for the school year.
So regardless of what they found in New York or DC, these funds need to be released and
they can continue to do their witch hunt.
But ultimately this is about kids and kids' futures.
So we should not be holding this money up for those reasons.
Well, I would love if they actually do cut these funds that our governor should call a special
session so that we can make sure that we are getting these funds to our schools.
I think this is that important if they do continue to hold these funds and hold these dollars
hostage impact in a school year where we can do so much great things in our school settings.
That is something that could possibly happen that you have after school programs cut,
you have teacher training programs and preparation programs that are cut and you're having school
districts have to dig into their funds to be able to supplant the cuts that are going
to occur. So we don't want that to be the case. And ultimately, as I shared, if that
is the case, then a special session should be called to ensure that money is allocated
to replace any possible cuts that could occur.
Yes, so we have an after-school provider that can speak to how this could impact their day-to-day.
Good morning. My name is Julia Rugg and I'm the CEO of Wings for Kids. We've run after-school
programs here in Atlanta, Georgia, and we've been doing that since 2012. I'll share this. We
operate at the Title I elementary schools for all of our programs here, and we've had conversations
this week with our principals who have told us. First of all, when we start our program, we already
have a delay of usually about a week or two just because we're getting the kids situated and having
them stabilize their enrollment. But going beyond that, that does impact their school enrollment.
These are kids who need, and these are families who need someplace after school so that their
parents can work, and if there isn't, a lot of them can't afford to be able to find
another place to send their children, so they just don't show up at school. And they
have literally told us that as much as 40% school enrollment drop that occurs, and that's
additional learning loss that we are seeing right off the bat from the school year. So
this has a huge trickle effect that's going to be impacting not just our programs, but
the families, the caregivers, and the working employment.
Thank you.
All right, we're good.
All right, thank you all so much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
