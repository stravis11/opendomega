TRANSCRIPT
----------
Come on in and take your seats and we'll call the meeting to order
Got a little housekeeping to do here first. I'd like to hear a move to send Senate Bill 111 to the judiciary committee
I won't move second any opposition. Okay, it's now in judiciary
Okay
I want to call on Senator Govind to explain Senate Bill 79 to us, please.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.
This is Senate Bill 79, the fear act, a fentanyl eradication removal act.
This is Lieutenant Govinders' Bill.
We made a little bit of what we're doing to strengthen the penalties for fentanyl trafficking.
And the reason that is is fentanyl, as we know the fentanyl epidemic.
This is a Splendid packet.
It's one gram.
One gram of fentanyl killed 500 people.
We made some changes in the civil non-Judy house.
We took out the portion that was concerning possession
and kept all the language regarding trafficking.
It works.
It's just a continuation of our efforts of the Austin's law
that Whipershit carried in the house
last year trying to address the fentanyl epidemic.
well you've heard the explanation or any questions good job senator don't
see thank you thank you thank you mr chairman we also have a rules
substitute for Senate bill 69 and we'll recognize Chairman Leveritt to
explain the rules substitute to us please thank you mr chairman ladies and
Jim, and this is the second part of the governor's lawsuit
informed package you've heard me speak.
It linked about it the other day, it came out of the subcommittee
and then actually came out of the rules committee.
We do have two changes, however, to that bill
that are in the proposed substitute.
The first change is on lines 107 through 110.
That's on page five.
It just adds a new exception to the operation of the statute
for basically someone who is an investor in a company
that provides the litigation financing.
So the idea is the litigation financier
still has to, when they apply, disclose ownership
that's over the 10%, so they would be disclosing
some of the people who invest in that litigation
financing company, but the investors themselves
don't have to actually register under the act.
So disclosure of the investment is still required
by the applicant, by the financier,
but the investors, the people who might invest
in that litigation financing company itself,
don't have to actually register under the act.
And then the other changes online,
I'm sorry on page 12, online 278.
This was the provision that would require
joint and several liability.
We've just changed the word shall online 278 to May.
So the court would have some discretion
as to whether to impose that joint
several liability in a given case and that was a Charlie Miller's amendment which we are now
making in this substitute and those are the only changes Mr. Chairman I'm glad to ask any questions.
Okay you've heard the explanation do we have questions?
Don't see any? Okay do I hear a motion to approve rules substitute to Senate Bill 69 as LC
the 49, 23, 9, 4, S, have a motion and second is in the opposition, okay, it's approved.
Okay, now what we want to do is set a supplemental calendar for today under modified structured Senate
bill 40, have a move in a second in the opposition, it's on Senate bill 56, move in the
second in the opposition, it's on Senate bill 69, rule substitute, LC 49, 239, 4S, moved
seconded in the opposition it's on sent bill 79 moved and seconded in the
opposition it's on sent bill 105 moved and seconded in the opposition it's on
okay that'll set our supplemental calendar for today you'll get a notice we'll
have a rooms meeting at 9 a.m. in the morning and we'll see you then if not
Thank you.
