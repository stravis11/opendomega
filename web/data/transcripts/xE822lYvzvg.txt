TRANSCRIPT
----------
It looked like everybody was in a good mood and they were coming in, they were dancing and skipping and singing and listening to the music back there so maybe we were going to play that more often.
And we're going to recognize Chairman Leverett for a recognition and also a presentation of the legislation. Go ahead.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
First, just point first to privilege.
If I could ask everybody to turn around and look in the back of the room, my assistant
from Elverton, Erin Garland is sitting back there, she'll wave.
She's been up here before this in her first rodeo, but I just want to welcome her.
Thank you.
This is the first time she's been in the rules committee.
So appreciate her being here.
I'm so proud to work with her back in Elverton and glad she came up here tonight.
And I also wanted Mr. Chairman just to present a proposed rules committee sub to the committee.
It should be in front of you, it's for Senate Bill 148, it's LC610264S.
610264S and this is a combination of some other legislation that has all been through committee.
Some of it came back to us from the Senate attached and then the House Education Committee
also added another piece of legislation.
So the original bill, Senate Bill 148 is Section 2 on pages 2 and 3 and this is a pilot
program for development study of outdoor learning spaces on elementary and secondary school
property.
That was the original Senate bill and then it is unchanged other than being moved to Section
2.
Section 3 is Chairman Hawkins Hospital 629 on automated external defibrillators in elementary
schools and we're striking a paragraph there on lines 86 through 89.
I guess primarily because we have so many elementary schools is difficult to find enough
medical staff to be there and the automated machines basically instruct you on their
use as you use it so we don't feel that's necessary.
And that's, I think, a request to Cho, I believe.
Section four is House Bill 127.
That was Brent Cox's bill increasing the personal paid leave
from three to five days for teachers.
Yes, thank you, I'm pro Tim.
And so that's some other House legislation
that had passed out of House education,
and the Senate actually added that into the Senate bill.
And then the part, the new part that we are proposing
as a rules committee is section one,
which is a representative,
Tannen's House Bill 451,
that passed off of the House on March six.
That's the hunting safety instruction
for grade six through 12.
So all of this is a legislation
that's already been approved by appropriate committees.
We just trying to package up a couple of good pieces
legislation and the one thing, Mr. Chairman.
Okay, you've heard the explanation, you have any questions?
Okay, you don't see any questions.
Do I hear a motion that we approve Senate Bill 148 by Substitute L.C.
61, 0, 2, 6, 4, yes.
Motion and second in opposition.
Okay, it's approved.
Okay, if you will look, you should have on your desk,
We had about 38 or 40 requests for study committees and we have before you some 11 to ask for your recommendation.
And what we have done, the reason these are room substitutes, all these were changed from five days to three days.
the remainder of the proposition stayed the same,
but just changed the days from five days to three days.
And then the exception to that in the Substitute House
Resolution 753 was also combined with 428 and 655.
But we have 11 propositions all by rule substitute.
You should all have copies of those
for the rule substitute.
Like for you to look at those for a second,
and then I would like to ask that we have a motion
that we approve all of these study committees
with one vote, if that meets with the approval
of the committee.
Second.
Hold up, just a minute.
We have a motion that we accept these as a group, have a motion and a second that we accept
the 11 of these, they're all room substitute.
Any opposition to that?
Okay, we have that motion passes.
