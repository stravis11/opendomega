TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good morning, everybody.
Good morning.
If you would, please come in and have a seat.
And we'll begin our meeting this morning.
Going to ask Chairman Stevens to open us up with a word of prayer this morning.
most kind and gracious Heavenly Father thank you for this day as we go through
these heavy issues, point us the direction as we take our steps, point us in those
directions as well. Give us the wisdom, show us the way, all these things we ask
came in. Thank you, sir. Okay, let's hear from my senator.
Senator, come on back to the beat.
Is this one okay? Thank you for hearing this. It's Senate Bill 151. It started out as a joint
development authority bill. It has since changed and I want to thank Madam
of Pro Tem Jones for her hard work on working with the mayors and getting this done.
When I first moved to Fulton County 32 years ago, there were only two cities and
the rest was unincorporated.
Now there is no more unincorporated.
We have six cities.
This bill simply allows each city to create their own development authority.
And the Fulton Development Authority would not be able to do business if these cities create their own
development authority and pass it in ordinance.
Simply what that bill does and, again, I want to thank Madam Pro Tem.
for her hard work on this committee sub and working with the mayor's in North
Folk. I'll take any questions. Thank you, sir. Senator, I don't see any
questions. All right. Thank you. Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good
morning. Good morning, committee members. This morning I bring to you Senate Bill
96, LC number 6, 0, 0, 1, 4, 0, ECS. It's a pretty straightforward bill. It's a
It's a good government bill, it's clean up bill, what it does that reduces the administrative burden on state agencies by reducing the number of boards that have grown in active or perform duplicative roles that also restructure a couple of boards for efficiency.
I would be happy to answer any questions.
Okay. Thank you, sir. I don't see any questions. Thank you.
Senator Watson.
Chairman members of the committee I bring before you send it bill 44 at the bottom of page one
This is a deal with the milled rates as our property tax digest is going up
This is allowing our local school systems to lower the floor that we require them to say it at 14 meals down to 10 meals
If they see that they need to it's more of a financial management bill for our local school systems
Okay, no seeing any questions. All right. Thank you. Appreciate your support
Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, this is LC-492342S.
It is Senate Bill 13.
Mr. Chairman, what this bill does is, GIFA allows GIFA to include that for gas.
In my district down there, as you know, I got a massive territory, and some of my counties
are completely out of gas and they need to be funded or increased the
side of the pipeline and basically it's allowed to have a tool in the shed to
be able to increase your pipelines. Yes sir have a question. Thank you
Mr. Chairman. Thank you Senator for bringing the bill. Isn't it true that this
is a loan and not a grant so the folks that are utilizing the gas will be
paying for the infrastructure. Absolutely sir. Thank you. Thank you for bringing
bill. Absolutely. Okay, don't see any other questions. Thank you. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, sir.
Senator Hodges. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the opportunity to be here. I have
Senate Bill 131. It's midway of the second page LC 550520S. Basically what it does is it
establishes a health care website statewide to provide better health care
information to Georgia health care planners and consumers will have a
statewide website list of healthier providers listed by age language
proficiency gender location of practice and license type also will have the
month and year of their birth, city, county, and zip, but we'll have no personal
information. This is just for planning purposes and for a consumer
purposes. Okay, Senator, don't see any questions. Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir. Appreciate it.
Senator Robertson.
Well, I'm sorry. Wait a minute. There is a question. I'm sorry. Chair Martin has
a question. Yes, sir. In the center, and there's this high-assist in
committee, but I do think it's important. Some of the information while the
centers in tennis is it not true not to have personal information some of the
counties are small and using age and several of the classifications might
actually provide for personal identifying information that's my pause with
the bill in certain areas when you cut it by gender by age my specialty it is
going to say it was this doctor and that is the pause I have with the bill isn't
That's what we're talking about, it's been funding.
Representative, Mr. Chairman, that could be the case if it is not the intent and to get
the information that the Georgia Board of Health Care workforce needs, they have to get
the same information from all the counties whether the county is a big county or a small
county.
And again, what they're trying to do is be able planners need to look at our state and
say we have a deficit of a certain type of health care provider in a particular area
so that we don't have health care deserts.
That's the aim of this.
Jim and Hawkins, do you have a question?
Yeah, this question did come up in committee
and my opinion is that patients do look for age
in their providers and I know my wife likes to go
to a female physician.
So this helps the consumers, the patients,
select the provider that they really want it.
Thanks, good bill. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, sir. Don't, don't see any other questions.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate it.
Senator Robinson, come on.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm here on SB 100.
SB 100 is a very simple piece of legislation.
I found out yesterday afternoon around four o'clock.
I have five grand dollars. I found out yesterday around four o'clock
four o'clock that I'm getting my first grandson September 5th and I'm excited about it.
Thank you. But what that means is in 18 years my grandson's going to be able to go to the health
department and ask for his birth certificate and they're going to give it to him for $40.
I have a daughter who was born six years ago. My wife cut her medical core. Her name is Andy.
In 12 years, when Andy goes to the health department to get her birth certificate, her original birth certificate, she's going to have to hire an attorney.
She and thousand of other adopted children in Georgia have to hire an attorney, and they have to get a quarter of her from Superior Court.
It's been thousands of dollars in order to get their original birth certificate.
What I want to do is I want to put my daughter on the same plane, the same equal level with my grandson, and that's exactly what this bill would do.
It would allow adopted children to be able to go when they're 18 years old as adults and get a copy of their original birth certificate
And it's just that simple, Mr. Chair
Okay, don't see any questions. Thank you. Thank you, sir. God bless that. Yeah, Senator Brass
Morning, Mr. Chair, my members of the committee bring you SB 85 on page two third from the top
Simply a foster kid grant scholarship program
Just putting some eligibility requirements and kind of tightening up there and then again on page three
Top of the page SB193 and
This is a adult high school diploma program for ages 21 through 40 where the
Third parties that are running this program most of the payments they receive are on the back end
And as the people graduate, that's where they receive a bulk of their mind.
Okay, Senator, I don't see any questions on either of those.
Thank you.
All right.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Yes, ma'am.
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and committee.
I bring to you SB 252.
Decades ago, we put into code that any municipality with a population greater than 300,000 cannot transfer or convey property unless it's been abandoned for public use.
This bill would allow Atlanta, the sole city with 300,000 population or more, to be able to actually provide a piece of property to their school system as every other city and school system can do currently.
There's a piece of property next to an elementary school.
It will be a landswap with no land loss for the city of Atlanta.
And we've outlined that these swaps in the future
can only be for educational purposes by the school system.
Okay, no saying questions.
Thank you very much.
Senator Hickman.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and committee.
We're looking at Senate Bill 149, LC 492116.
Senate Bill 149 will allow for newly qualified
for your college institution systems
to participate in the TEG program.
The college university must be accredited
by the Southern Association of Colleges
and Schools Commission on Colleges
as a level six institution.
This bill actually passed the Senate last year,
passed its house last year,
and the governor's office made a few modifications to it,
and we have adhered to the governor's suggestion
on the modification, so we would appreciate that.
They will support this year.
Thank you.
Okay, no questions.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you all, sir.
Since we thank this chairman, members of the committee.
On page three, Senate Bill 260,
this is Central State Hospital Redevelopment Authority.
This is taking a nine member board down to four members
three which would be voting members and it's also putting all of the Central
State Hospital campus under the Department of Community Affairs. What the
campus consists of is about 2,000 acres and over 100 vacant buildings that were
left after Central State Hospital was closed down and lost 15,000 jobs and
this is trying to redevelop this property to create jobs, get the
Buildings and property on the tax roads in ballin county. I ask for your favorable consideration
Okay, don't see any questions. Thank you, sir. Thank you
Thank mr. Chairman members of the committee. The first bill I want to discuss is on page two
This is Senate bill 153
Every year as y'all are aware the official code of Georgia gets updated and
and technically cleaned up, whether it's a grammatical error or just very spacing.
So this is just the official code of Georgia annual cleanup bill.
The second bill is Senate Bill 154.
What this bill allows is for Georgia to continue to move forward if and when the U.S. Department
of Education is disbanded.
I know timing is everything and I'm told the president may be signing an executive order
right now to disband the U.S. Department of Education.
So this would be very timely if it were to get on the day.
But what it does is just in the Georgia code,
the US Department of Education is referenced at least 25 times.
And the biggest impact it has is on licensing.
If you're a dentist, optometrist, psychologist,
police officer, in order to be recognized as graduating
from a university that's accredited,
it has to be an unincredited list by the US Department
of Education.
So what this says is where it references the U.S. Department
Education, it just puts a comma and says,
or it's successor.
Right now we don't know what that successor will be.
It may end up being the state or another federal agency.
But if this bill passes, then if the president
does sign the executive order and it goes into effect,
Georgia will continue to be able to license professionals
in the state to move forward.
So I would ask for that.
And then the last bill is on page three.
This is Senate Bill 141.
This is a Department of Revenue bill.
And what it does is it makes two tweaks to our statute
that will raise the grade that Georgia gets
from a B minus to an A and potentially an A plus.
Okay, no questions.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Senator Kamona.
Morning, Mr. Chairman, committee.
Two bills on here, Senate bill 17, Ricky and Alyssa's Law.
This bill, part of it you've seen before, the new part we've added, Ricky Espinol's name to this bill, who's killed at Appalachia, has two components,
mobile panic alert system, and a mapping requirement for school systems in Georgia, and then separately, it's sent in bill 110, which is our free range bill that we presented last time.
Okay.
Don't see any questions on these.
Senator Anderson.
Senator Anderson.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
It's such honor to be in your presence today.
We feel the same way.
Yes, sir.
On the third page, Senate Bill 293 is
having our veterans.
We're going to expand a free
car tags to two instead of one okay do you have a question for you here lady
Smith thank you senator I was before one of your committees yesterday on the
Senate side and I believe they've amended this bill to a house bill on the Senate
side so do you know anything about that I'm in conversation with chairman
But I mean, this is the best for you all.
Todd me, I didn't understand.
I think it's a best bill on the other bill too.
Okay, you don't see any other questions.
Thank you sir.
Thank you sir.
So you're just asking.
Thanks Chair and members of the committee, a top of page two under modified structure
Senate Bill 51, relates to qualification-based elections of architects and engineers, takes the process we use in our university and state procurement system and applies it to cities and counties.
I'll add to that question.
Okay.
I don't see any questions.
Thank you, sir.
Senator Walker.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning committee on page two right in the middle Senate bill 125
It would allow
For engineers and training to take their professional engineering exam
Anytime after they complete their coursework their academic work instead of having to wait to the end of their
build experience
Have this will improve the pass fell rate
Okay, you don't see any questions. Thank you.
Okay, we appreciate it.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm asking for Senate Bill 68. It's second from the bottom on page three and what Senate Bill 68 does is makes revisions reasonable revisions to the Civil Practice Act, the Evidentiary Code, and premises liability.
Okay.
You have a question.
Thank you Mr. Chairman, to the whip.
My understanding is that the bill came over to us from the Senate obviously was not engrossed
and I was wondering what was the wisdom to make it structured on our side when they didn't
restrict it on their side.
Well the wisdom of the chair of the committee is put it in a structured format.
Not a revenue bill, just curious why.
So we've had about 13 or 15 hours of debate on this bill and we've heard from folks
all over the state and I feel like that most questions have been asked and so we want
to go ahead and try to deal with this and move that out so that's the reason for that.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And I also believe that the representative asking the question has had a thorough vetting
of the bill and I believe there will be an opportunity to do that on the floor.
Did you have another question?
Just to respond I appreciate that I did.
I was put on the subcommittee but there were a lot of people that didn't and
it would have been nice to at least been able to offer amendments to propose for the floor
but when it's structured we can't even do that.
And I just wanted to make the point that I didn't understand given it's not a revenue bill
Bill why were so afraid of amendments but thank you for the answer.
Thank you, thank you.
Any other members of the committee?
The desk will bill.
Okay.
Kevin Hawkins, did you need to answer?
I'd like to ask SB five.
SB.
Bill that reduces prior operation for providers who have a good clean track record.
Also known as the gold card bill we had last year.
Okay. Any questions? No questions.
Chairman Lynch, would you like to put my name by Senate Bill 110?
Okay. If these bills have already been asked for, there's no need to
put our name by them unless you'll just feel urged to do so.
Okay. Here we are. Let's
do a little housekeeping before we set the calendar.
Do I hear a move to recommit Senate Bill 151 back to Intergovernmental Coordination Committee?
Have a move and second. Is there any opposition?
Okay, it's sent back to committee.
Okay, now we'll set a calendar for today.
Under a structured Senate Bill 68.
Have a move in a second. Any opposition?
There is opposition. All those in favor say aye.
Those opposed say no. The eyes have it. Yes, I'm
Under modified structure Senate bill 153 have moved and second is there any opposition
It's on
Also under modified structure Senate bill 252
Move and second it is in opposition. It's on
Thank you very much. We're adjourned
