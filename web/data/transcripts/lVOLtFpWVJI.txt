you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you youthen you you you you you you in the Good Morning Good Morning this morning is familiar to all but 43 of you. It's the former representative Randy Nex of Lagrange. Pastor Nex. Good morning. I love those short introductions because they keep telling me that what I'm supposed to speak about is about five minutes and I can't do anything for five minutes. I was I'll soon be a former representative but I got a scripture verse that was sent to me this morning that says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. Hebrews 138 so I will I will just remind you of that and remind myself of that when I don't have to get up and come in here in the morning which is very good. Madam Speaker I want to thank you for allowing me to come. I'm extremely honored to be here for this first time as an almost non-member. Before I begin my devotional thoughts though I must acknowledge the absence of Speaker David Ralston. Someone that I counted as a very dear friend and someone who loved this house. I believe there are plans to honor him at a later date and I know that he will be missed in many ways. I want to take just a minute to share a few thoughts with you this morning maybe a word of inspiration but share just a little bit of my experience some of the things I learned I'm not going to say wisdom but experience from the last 16 years. I'd like to start with a brief story. Andy Stanley who many of you know prominent Atlanta pastor the founder of North Point Ministries wrote a book in 2022 titled Not In It to Win it and it was a great discussion on the intersection of politics and the church. He tells a story that occurred when one of his children was just 18 months old. He said that they had a baby monitor on the baby's crib and the baby was upstairs they were downstairs they had had some friends over for dinner and they were cleaning up. He said as they were doing that they began to hear the child up there coughing violently and they listened just a moment and it got worse and it was obvious the child was having trouble breathing. He said they ran up there got to the child picked him up and did everything they could do but it just was not getting any better and then in a moment of panic they called 911. Well he said it seemed like kind of an eternity but just a few minutes later the EMTs arrived. He said as they came in the front door his wife brought them to him he was standing in the kitchen holding the child and as they came in they had all their equipment they set it down and the oldest of the two EMTs came and reached to take the baby and he said of course I stepped back. He said I asked the question any responsible parent would ask before handing their child over to a skilled emergency medical technician or you'll Republican or Democrat. You would never trust the health of your sick child to someone without the first knowing their political affiliation would you? Right? And he says of course not you are only concerned with their competency and their ability and their desire to help your sick child and from my experience I think that the moral of that story is that everything can't be measured by ours and these. The greatest currency that you can have is relationships and that is especially true as you work with your fellow members here in this house. I'd like to challenge you if I made to write down and possibly memorize two verses of scripture that meant a lot to me over the last 16 years. The first one is Psalm 5110 create in me a clean heart oh God and renew a right spirit within me and then Psalm 1914 let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in that site oh Lord my strength and my Redeemer. Did you notice the one word that was in both of those verses? The heart the meditation of my heart and creating me a clean heart. The Bible says that the Bible definition of heart says it is the seat of life or strength hits it means mind soul spirit or one's entire emotional nature and understanding and Jesus says this about the heart he said but those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart and they defile the person for out of the heart proceeds evil thoughts murders adulteries thefts false witness and blasphemies so I ask you to memorize those verses right those verses down review them often and keep your heart clean as you deal with your fellow members here and I think that will make it a whole lot easier I'd like to close and I hope I'm within my five minutes are pretty close with a poem that I think will help you develop and maintain a clean heart and to build those strong and productive relationships with your fellow members this was written by Luis Shimon and it's titled I Know Something Good About You wouldn't this old world be better if the folks we meet would say I know something good about you and treat us just that way wouldn't it be fine and dandy if each hand class found and true carried with it this assurance I know something good about you wouldn't life be much more happy if the good that you know all were the only thing about us that folks bothered to recall wouldn't life be lots more happy if we praised the good we see for there's such a lot of goodness in the worst of you and me wouldn't it be nice to practice that fine way of thinking too you know something good about me I know something good about you would you stand with me for prayer please Lord I come to you this morning and I lift up each member of this house Lord those that have been here for a long time and those that are new for that pray for them I pray that they will work to maintain clean hearts that they will keep themselves in a position to be able to work with others on a on a basis that would make them cooperate and do the people's business Lord we thank you for the many blessings you've given us I pray this day for the leadership of

this house. Father, I thank you that you have put them in this place at this time, for this time to do your will. Lord, go with them throughout this day and throughout this session and let them turn to you for all knowledge, for we know that all good things come from you in Christ's name. Amen. Now if you would please join me in the Plague of Allegiance. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Doorkeepers will open the doors. The house will come to attention.

The Chair appoints as the Committee of Best Court, the gentleman from the 33rd Representative of Allen Powell, the gentleman from the 11th Representative Rick Jaspers, the gentleman from the 139th Representative Richard Smith, the gentleman from the 155th Representative Matt Hatchett, the gentleman from the 176th Representative James Perchette, the gentleman from the 9th Representative Will Wade, the lady from the 13th Representative Katie Dempsey, the gentleman from the 29th Representative Matt Dubnick, the lady from the 147th Representative Bethany Ballard, the lady from the 137th Representative Debbie Buckner, the gentleman from the 128th Representative Mack Jackson, the lady from the 117th Representative Lauren Daniel. Will the Committee of Best Court please as the speaker into the House? Good morning. Not because of this, but because of y'all what a great day for Georgia. Let me salute y'all. Thank you, my Lord, to lead the Beverly. I appreciate that. Thank you, Lauren, for those kind of words. To my dear friend, Jim and Butch Perch, appreciate you more than you know. Thank you. And I want to thank you all. Thank you for the honor of serving as your speaker, whether you're a Republican or Democrat, new or returning member, I will work to serve each of you and our House to the very best of my ability. This is admittedly a very sweet moment, that very bitter sweet moment. Just a matter of weeks before today, I never would have imagined standing for this office. The passing of speaker David Ralston has left a hole in the heart of this House. I was honored to call him my speaker, but I considered it an even greater honor to have called him my friend. I want to thank our 74th speaker, Jan Jones. I want to thank speaker, Jan Jones, for stepping into the chair when speaker Ralston passed. And doing so, she became the first lady to grace this office in the history of our great state. Thank you, Jim. Applause. Now, my vision for this House is straightforward. This House will continue to lead. It will continue to be independent while working with our colleagues in the Senate and the governor. It will continue to champion those policies which keep Georgia the best place to live, work, and yes, raise a family. There are times we may disagree. That's a healthy part of a representative body. But when we do disagree, we must do so respectfully and in accordance with the rules that we will adopt. I am honored to serve you as the speaker of the People's House. Now, on this great day that we celebrate, I would be remiss if I did not thank all of the families who were here today to celebrate with us all. Applause. I want to particularly thank my family and the love of my life, my wife Dale, for her support, for walking with me on our journey together. Thank you, honey. I love you. Applause. I know, I know she's the better half. I get it. No doubt about that. Soon, the House will begin the work of the session. Adopt any budget, passing legislation, and advancing policies that will move this state forward. Thank you for your confidence. I look forward to serving with all of you as we move through this process. Thank you very much. I am very humbled. Applause. Applause. Applause. Now, we have some, we have some couple of things to tend to, young. We are going to move through them very respectfully and very deliberately. The first thing we are going to do next is to elect a speaker pro-tem. We are going to elect a speaker pro-tem for the House for the 20, 20, 23, 20, 24 term. The House is now open for nominations for speaker pro-tem. The chair now recognizes the German from the 155th District Representative Matt Hatcher for nomination. Thank you, speaker Burns. I rise to nominate the lady from the 47th, the 74th speaker of this House, the Honorable Jan Jones as speaker pro-tem for the 20, 23, 20, 24 session. My friend and our friend, Representative Matt Hatcher, has nominated, nominated, represented Jan Jones to be the speaker pro-tem of the House for the 2023, 2024 term. Chair now recognizes the lady from the 177th District Representative Penny Housen. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It is my honor and privilege to second the nomination of speaker Jan Jones for speaker pro-tem. And many of us have talked so much about Jan being the first woman to serve as speaker. To put it in more perspective, Georgia was created on January the 1788 and Jan and Representative Jones, speaker Jones is the first woman to serve in this position. Thank you, Jan, for what you do for this day. And I'm sure she'll continue to work as she has for the past 22 years, I think, that she's been here. And we are honored to have her represent us as speaker pro-tem. Thank you, Representative. Yes, it's been a long wait, but it's a good thing coming, so we're glad we're so proud. Now, I represent the majority leader for a mechanism, majority leader for a motion. The thing to speak, or I move that nominations be closed. The majority leader has moved that the nominations for speaker pro-tem be closed. Is there objection to closing the nominations? Very none, the nominations are closed. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from the 100th. Majority leader wishes to be recognized again. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move that the House elect representative Jan Jones as speaker pro-tem by acclimation. Majority leader has moved that the nominee for speaker pro-tem, Jan Jones, the elected by acclimation is the objection. Is there no objection? Speaker pro-tem, Jan Jones, the new speaker pro-tem for the 2023-2024 terms. The chair appoints as a committee of escort, the gentleman from the 10th, representing Victor Anderson, the lady from the 23rd, representing Mandy Ballinger, the gentleman from the 5th, representing Matt Barton, the lady from the 135th, representing Beth Camp, the gentleman from the 171st, representative Joe Campbell, the gentleman from the 154th, representative Gerald Brain, the lady from the 156th, representative Lisa Hagan, the lady from the 60th, representative Sheila Jones, the gentleman from the 25th, representative Todd Jones, the lady from the 56th, representing Misha Maynard, the lady from the 173rd, representing Darling Taylor, and the gentleman from the 152th, representing Bill Yurtter.

Your service to the people of Georgia in this house has been exemplary. We look forward to continue to work with you as the leader in this house and we appreciate you in which you've done for all of Georgia's. Thank you. Thank you very much. Well, thank you and thank all of you here today for allowing me to serve as speaker pro-tem of the people's house. I'm truly proud to know you to work beside each one of you and to uphold the traditions in the honor of the house. I want to thank the gentleman from the 155th from Dublin, Georgia, where my mother lives, Matt Hatchett for nominating me and thank you to the gentle lady of the 170th from Nashville, my good friend, Penny Houston, for seconding my nomination and not being able to go without saying a few words. Even though she was probably asked not to. But you know Penny, I'm grateful to serve by God's grace and with the support of the good people of the 47th district in North Fulton just as you serve because of the people back home that have elected you. I serve because my family stands behind me and with me patiently as your families do for you. And I hope you never forget that because when you come in, you come in with the support of your friends and family and I wish for each one of you when you leave that you leave with the support and the good closeness of your friends and family. Please I encourage you not to forget that. Thank you to my husband, Kaylen, our four children, the newest Jones granddaughter Agnes, and another grandchild arriving this year. I'm also grateful to this body for its sound judgment in electing John Burns as the 175th speaker of the Georgia House of Representatives. John Burns nominated me as speaker pro-tem 14 sessions ago, the first session in which I served as speaker pro-tem and I've never forgotten it. I know his heart and his deep commitment in improving Georgia's lives. I'm honored to serve this house and use speaker burns on its behalf. I look forward to majority leader Chuck F. Strachan's strong leadership, the good work of the majority leadership team and the Republican caucus, as well congratulations to minority leader James Beverly and new minority whip Sam Park in their critical roles. I look forward to joining with both of you the minority caucus leadership team and the Democrat caucus as we strive all together, all 180 of us, to make Georgia an unparalleled place of opportunity for our constituents. Welcome to the 43 newly elected freshman to the people's house. We serve in a capital building that echoes the efforts of representatives that came before us, including the enduring accomplishments of former speaker David Ralston, who I miss every day. For 134 years legislators have gathered in this building to craft solutions that improve constituents' lives and each one of you will be a part of that this term. I'm confident we'll continue to do the same this session and only by each of us, Democrat, Republican, rural, suburban and urban working together and focusing on what is truly important to the 11 million people who call Georgia home. I appreciate you as the people's representatives and your role in moving Georgia ever forward. Thank you once again for allowing me to serve you as your speaker, Pro Tem. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Representative Jones, for your service to Georgia. The next order of business is the election of the clerk of the house for the 2023-2024 term. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from the 33rd district representative, Alan Powell. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It's an honor for me to rise this morning to nominate William Bill Riley, the officer of the clerk of this house. To the new members, the clerk of the house, that role that he portrays is one of the most important functions of this house. This is the man who guides the office that prints all the bills, he records all the bills, he will be your friend and most importantly, he will follow in the footsteps of the greats of Glenn Ellard, Robbie Rivers, as he has done for the last 10 years of shepherding this house. The importance of this position while he's not a district elected official, is that he is the most important officer of this body. He runs that office and probably with that I doubt we have the best clerk's office in the nation and you soon will find out as so many of your senior colleagues have the importance of that office. He can give guidance, he can give counsel, he's just not going to tell you how to vote because he is that nonpartisan. But this is a great man and ladies and gentlemen, I would refer you to him and his knowledge to get to know him, he's Bill and just hope that even though his hobby at his age, he is still an avid snowskier that he doesn't break his darn leg before the end of the session. Mr. Speaker, I nominate Bill Riley, the clerk of this house. Thank you, Representative. Ellen Powell has nominated Bill Riley to be clerk of the house for the 2023-2024 term. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from the 132nd House District, representing Brian Prince. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise the second denomination of William Bill Riley for clerk of the house, one who always serves not for himself, but for others. Representative Brian Prince has seconded the nomination of Bill Riley to be elected clerk of the house for the 2023-2024 term. The chair now recognizes the majority leader for emotion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move that the nominations be closed and that the entire membership of the house cast their vote for the election of Bill Riley as clerk of this house. The majority leader has moved that the nominations for clerk be closed and that the entire membership cast their votes for the election of Bill Riley as clerk. Is there any objection to the nominations being closed? The chair here's none, the nominations are closed. Is there any objection to directing the deputy clerk to cast the entire vote of the membership who are present for the election of Bill Riley as clerk of this body? The chair here's none, the deputy clerk is so directed. On the election of the clerk of the house, Bill Riley received the entire vote of the membership who are present and is hereby declared elected clerk for the ensuing term. Congratulations, clerk Riley. The chair appoints as a committee of escorts, the gentleman from the second, the gentleman from the 11th representative Rick Jasper's, the lady from the 53rd representative Deborah Silcox, the gentleman from the 78th representative to Beatrice Douglas, the gentleman from the 81st representative Scott Hochem, the lady from the 95th representative Darshan Kendrick, the lady from the 106th representative Shelley Hutchinson, the gentleman from the 138th representative Vance Smith with a committee of escorts when you all convene, no rush. There is a plane leaving here. Will the committee of escorts please escort the clerk into the house? At this time, let me do that. That may need some work. At this time, the chair will administer the oath of office to the clerk of the house, Bill Riley. Okay, Bill. Do you hear by swear that you will discharge the duties of the office of the clerk of the house of representatives faithfully into the best of your skill and knowledge? Do you further swear that you are not the holder of any public money, do this state or any political subdivision or authority thereof, unaccounted for? That you are not the holder of any office of trust under the government of the United States, nor of any one of the several states, nor of any foreign state, that you are otherwise qualified to hold said office according to the Constitution and the laws of Georgia. If you do, please state I do. Congratulations. Clerk of the house, Bill Riley. Thank you, Mr. Clerk. We all...

appreciate those of us who have been here, appreciate your work and your diligence. And the members that have just arrived will certainly do that in the very near future. Thank you for your devotion to Georgia and your service. And I may well at this point make the point on thank you for your devotion to the late speaker David Ralston, your his dear friend and former law partner. And I know he loved you, thought the world of you and y'all were a great team and we look forward to working with you. The next order of our business is the election of a doorkeeper for the House for the 2023 24 term. The House is now open for nominations for doorkeeper. The chair recognizes a gentleman from the sixth, sixth district representative Jason Ridley. Mr. Baker, I rise to nominate great George and Cory Mokey as a 2023 2024 doorkeeper. Furthermore Mr. Baker, I mean what better man could you find that looks more like a doorkeeper than Mr. Cork? I'll have to say amen to that nomination. No doubt about that. Thank you.

On the election of doorkeeper, Cory Mokey received the entire vote of the membership who are present and he is hereby declared door-elected doorkeeper for the ensuing term. Congratulations, Cory. For those who do not know Cory, you need to meet him. He is a fine gentleman. We appreciate your service in the past and different capacities. But I look forward to you taking care of us as the doorkeeper. Thank you so much. Our next order of business is the election of a messenger for the House for the 2023-2024 term. The House is now open for nominations for the messenger. The chair recognizes gentlemen from the 155th House District, representing Matt Hatcher. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It's my pleasure and honor to nominate Ms. Betsy Theroux as the House Messenger. And furthermore, she has held this position previously and served our Speaker Austin for many years being, I would say, his left hand in making sure that this House keeps moving as efficiently as possible. Thank you, Representative, for the nomination of Betsy Theroux as the messenger. The chair recognizes the lady from the 42nd, Representative Tyrion Nillowis. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today with the honor of seconding the nomination of Betsy Theroux for House Messenger. I know that my returning colleagues are familiar with Betsy's warmth and kindness. I'm so excited that now all of our new colleagues, our new members here, they get to experience that firsthand as well as her professionalism, her depth of knowledge of this chamber. And perhaps most importantly, her unfailing patience with each and every one of us. I'm honored to second Betsy Theroux for House Messenger. And especially with me. Thank you, Representative Nillowis. Chair Nill recognizes the majority leader for a motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move that nominations be closed and that the entire membership casts their votes for the election of Betsy Theroux as Messenger. The majority leader has moved that the nominations of the House be closed and that the entire membership casts their votes for the election of Betsy Theroux as Messenger. Is there any objection to closing the nominations? Chair, here's none and the nominations are closed. Is there any objection to directing the clerk to cast the entire vote of the membership who are present for the election of Betsy Theroux as Messenger? Chair, here's none and the clerk is so directed. On the election of the Messenger, Betsy Theroux received the entire vote of the membership who are present and she is hereby declared elected Messenger for the ensuing term. That's Betsy. If the message you wanted to say something and she declined, I don't know if anyone in this building or any professional that I know that does their job with the integrity, with the compassion and with the fairness that Betsy does. So for you new members, get the knower, you will, for us members that have just a little returning, we're so pleased that you would come back and be a part of our team here in the House.

We're going to put it on the board, and the majority leader will walk us through it. I think you'll like this. He's upstaged me, so that's fine, majority leader. So at this time, I will recognize the majority leader to present Senate Resolution 6 on adjournment. Well, thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I'm very pleased to report to you that we have an adjournment resolution for all 40 days of the House. Well we're just getting started with the good news, and this is all thanks to Speaker John Burns, providing leadership as we work through this process. I just really think this speaks to the great working relationship that we begin with the Senate. The ability to work together to iron out details like this to provide predictability for our members throughout all of the session. So I'll just begin by walking you through Senate Resolution 6. We can talk about some of the specifics. We will not be in for session tomorrow. We will be back here Wednesday.

week and then Thursday as we already passed we will meet for the joint session for the inauguration on Thursday. We'll be back here Friday and then this Friday will be the last Friday legislative session we have in this chamber this year. So I know the speaker and I are very aware of how important it is that we have time with our families that we have time at our businesses that we have an opportunity to work on legislation before the next week so they'll be the opportunity to have Fridays to focus on those matters and a joint week ends. So if the clerk would move to the second page of the adjournment resolution we'll have copies, there are 180 copies of the adjournment resolution up front so if you'd like to get a copy you'll be able to do so but I'll just point out to you that crossover day is legislative day 28 that will be Monday March 6th and then if you move to the third page please. Sani Dye will be Wednesday March 29th and so that we will conclude the legislative session before the end of March this year. Well I appreciate everyone holding tight while we waited for this to come over to the Senate and I think it was certainly worth the wait and I'd ask for your favorable consideration to Senate resolution 6. Thank you. Will the gentleman yield if there's a question? Does anyone have a question? Yes sir. I see no questions so good work. Thank you. Now don't leave yet. So I might understand on your first day as majority leader you were able to confound the Senate in some manner and schedule the entire session. Only thanks outstanding leadership from the speaker's office thank you Mr. Speaker. We didn't we didn't have anything to do with it thanks to you Mr. Leader and your able council Sam West I'll mention Sam as well to his great work. We it makes this resolution even more meaningful when we see the members here today and the families that were here with all of us here today have imported this for us to be able to come here and do this work for the people of Georgia but also to have time to spend with our families to make sure we take care of our first priority and that's our families. So thank you Mr. Leader we appreciate everything you've done here and I'll ask the question all those in favor of the adoption of the resolution will vote yes which is green those opposed no which is red and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted. It's pretty awesome. Have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the machines. On the adoption of Senate resolution six I think we have a unanimous vote 140 feet 43 yes so congratulations Mr. Chairman Mr. Leader that's awesome and congratulations to all of us for having a schedule that's kind to us all in respect for for us all the motion has been adopted.
