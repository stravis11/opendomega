seesaw audible conversation I would ask
the door Keepers secure the chamber at
this time
I want to recognize the senator Defender
53rd for the second time today as as in
he's got the chaplain of the day
he's trying to tell us something ladies
and gentlemen
I recognize our good senator from the
53rd uh for our pledge allegiance and
our chaplain of the day senator
thank you Mr President let's pledge to
the flag
pledge allegiance to the flag
one nation under God indivisible with
liberty and confesses for all now the
Georgia flag
I pledge allegiance to the Georgia flag
the principles for which it stands
system Justice moderation and courage
so this is uh two days in a row now I've
had the pastor of the day and I told you
yesterday that I had known that Pastor
my entire life well the pastor today I
have not known very long
um probably have only spoken to him
maybe about two hours my entire life now
why in the world would I bring somebody
up here to be the pastor of the day that
I haven't known very long
well whether you're up in the top of the
gallery today or whether you're in the
Senate chamber there was a great
Frenchman who came over to America wrote
this big book called democracy and in
that book he said the government the
people are going to get the government
they deserve and if they don't get
involved in it they don't deserve very
much
and this pastor of the day has been
involved in government for a long time
nearly 30 years I believe
as a Chaplain to Sheriff's officers in
the Sheriff's Department
and they we know they go through a lot
of difficulties in their role they need
a shoulder to lean on and that's been
his role he is also the pastor of
Memorial Baptist Tabernacle in Walker
County and you know he's got his two
sons with him when I first met him at
the capitol or I'm sorry he's got his
one son and his friend is always
bringing a young person along to the
Capitol because I believe he feels in
his heart that they're going to get the
government they deserve and he's
encouraging them to get involved in it
so that's why I've invited him to be the
pastor of the day today this is Pastor
Tim Owens
good morning
Mr President
Senator Moore thank you so much for the
invitation to be here today it is an
honor to be back and uh I want to let
you know from our folks back at Memorial
Baptist in Rossville Georgia they send
their greetings and their prayers to you
and I'm privileged to serve the Walker
County Sheriff's department and we've
got the finest sheriff in the state of
Georgia and staff and they send their
prayers to each one of you and I know
I'd just have a few minutes this morning
about it I'd like to take just a few
minutes to encourage you this morning
and thank you for the work that you do
um
many people don't realize the sacrifice
that you all make the uh the challenges
and the struggles that you deal with and
I want to read a chapter or a little bit
of scripture here for you this morning
and the back story of it is that the
Pharisees were coming to Jesus and they
were trying to trick him with some
information about the law so they came
to Jesus and this is in Matthew chapter
22 verse 36 it says Master which is the
greatest commandment in the law and
Jesus said unto him thou shall love the
Lord thy God with all thy heart and with
all thy soul and with all thy mind
this is the first and great commandment
and the second is like unto it thou
shall love thy neighbor as thyself on
these two Commandments hang all the law
and the prophets
and this right here they were trying to
trick Jesus by saying with all the Ten
Commandments that you've given and then
the Pharisees had come up with over 600
other Commandments they were trying to
trick him into saying what are the
greatest commandment and Jesus surprised
them with his statement that the two
greatest Commandments are to love the
Lord with all of our heart and to love
our neighbor as ourselves and for all of
us today I want to encourage us to love
the Lord with all of our heart with all
of our mind and with all of our soul and
basically what that means is we're to
love God with every fiber of our being
and for many people that's fairly easy
to do it's the second part that seems to
get us in trouble A lot of times we live
in a country that's divided we live in a
time that's more divided than probably
many of us have ever seen
but in this passage of scripture Jesus
tells us that we're to love our
neighbors as ourself and most of us in
here
we love ourselves we take care of
ourselves
and in a deliberative body like the
Senate it's very easy to get divided
it's very easy to argue and fuss but
when we look at each other and realize
that not only are we human beings but we
every one of us in here were created in
the image of almighty God
and when we learn to start to love
people
I believe it's hard to love God if you
don't love your neighbor
it's easy to love your neighbor when you
love God
now in the day and times that we live in
I'll be honest with you I get frustrated
sometimes because I think I'm just a
citizen what can I do to stop the Divide
what can I do Jesus tells us right here
that we can love each other
what I do with the sheriff's department
what I do at the church being senior
pastor of the church my favorite title
of the church is Chief servant and
that's that's why I am with the
Sheriff's Department
but what can I do
to help change the country that we live
in to help change the divide in the
state that we have
I can love other people
if I love you
the way God loves me
if I can love you regardless of what our
ideology is regardless if you're
Republican or Democrat
we can still get along
we can
have challenges we can debate but at the
end of the day when we look at each
other that every single one of us was
made and created in the wonderful image
of God
my job
is to love the people around me
I know
as a pastor my what God's called me to
do what God's called you to do have some
similarities of course I know none of
you have ever been called names in the
Press none of you have ever had anybody
lie about you nobody's ever said bad
things about you I'm sure that's just
pastors that that happens to
but we can love people matter of fact
the Bible says in Matthew Chapter 5 you
have heard that it has been said thou
shall love thy neighbor and hate thine
enemy but I say unto you love your
enemies bless them that curse you do
good to them that hate you and pray for
them which despitefully use you and
prosecute you that ye may be the
children of your father which is in
heaven for he maketh his son to rise on
the evil and on the good and sendeth
Reign on the just and the unjust
this morning I want to encourage you to
love your neighbor and here's the way I
think it works
when we as individual people begin to
love other people like God who's loved
us when we love other people like God
has not only loved us but challenge us
to love each other
if we do it
and we encourage others to do it could
you imagine coming here today if I could
encourage each one of you to love your
neighbor
then all of a sudden change happens and
then it goes from this body
to Across the capital to the house it
leaves here it goes to the citizenry God
never intended for us to be divided in
hateful but he said that we're to love
each other
I want you all to know this morning that
I love you I pray for you I've got a
directory that I pray for each one of
you every week and I want to let you
know that I'm available at any time if
you need somebody to talk to you need
somebody to pray with you your family's
struggling with something I'm always
available but I want to encourage you to
love each other
let the change happen here and spread
everywhere else may I pray with you
father I thank you Lord for today Lord I
Thank you Lord for this body Lord I
Thank you Lord for the important work
that they do and father I pray that you
will bless them that you will bless
their families Lord I pray that you'll
give each one of them Godly wisdom to
know to do right
regardless of the political cost father
to do right Lord I pray that you'll give
them protection you'll protect every
member of their staff their family and
Lord I just ask that you'll watch over
then Lord help us to learn how to love
our neighbors like we should Lord help
us to debate but to love like you have
loved us and the difference of that
we'll make will go for Generations Lord
I Thank you for each one in this
building thank you so much in Jesus name
we pray amen
if we could get to the door Keepers to
close the chamber and get all our
Senators in here and take their seats I
greatly appreciate it
if I could get everybody's attention
real quick I get everybody's attention
real quick please
we got a a special guest with us here
today somebody that I know uh most
people who've been here a little while
are very familiar with we have our
former president of this body uh uh the
The Honorable Casey Cagle here with us
today Casey stand up take a stand up
right here thank you very much
I wanted to have Casey down to have
lunch and everything and it was kind of
funny he got up he got up here he stood
around and looked he said Yep looks
about the same yeah I said hadn't
changed much I promise you different
faces same same song and dance but you
know Casey was always a great mentor to
myself as well as a lot of people in
this room uh he served in this body uh I
believe 10 years as a senator at 12
years as a state senator from Hall
County and then served 14 is it 14 years
12 12 is a state senator I mean as a
lieutenant governor as well and uh and
he's somebody that I've always since the
being elected he's somebody I've I've
reached out to called on to ask for
advice and and things of that nature and
guidance and he's been he's been a great
friend been a great mentor been a a good
person to lean on and and I just wanted
to uh have him down today uh and have
have lunch with him but I also wanted
him to come back into the body and
address everyone here and also wanted us
to show our appreciation for his 24
years of service uh to this to this
state and to this body as well so uh so
right at this moment I'd like to yield
the floor to our my good friend Casey
Cagle
wow well
thank you all very very much and
obviously to Mr President thank you for
the invitation
um
time for convening haven't arrived the
Senate will come to order
[Laughter]
I've been away for a good while but some
things never change uh which is which is
good uh but it's great to be with you
today I appreciate the good work that
all of you have done this session I know
that we're getting close to the end and
everyone's excited about that but I'm
particularly proud of the lieutenant
governor as well as the governor and the
new speaker and just in general the good
work that you guys have done I I will
report to you however that there is life
after politics and it's pretty doggone
good uh Nita and I uh we have eight
little grandbabies now they're all seven
and under and we have plenty to keep us
busy I built a little river cabin up in
Hazel North Carolina and we get to make
a lot of great memories up there and
this life outside of Politics As I said
has been very very good but it's good to
be with each of you I don't have really
any words of wisdom but I would just
reflect for a moment as the lieutenant
governor articulated 24 years in public
life and that's an awful long time 12 of
those as a state senator 12 as
lieutenant governor but when I came in
in 1994 this body was controlled by
democrats and I was a republican the
first Republican state senator from Hall
County and obviously later the first
Republican lieutenant governor in
Georgia's history but I was trained by
democrats back then
and you had to work across the aisle in
order to get anything done and I think
that that is what is so beautiful about
this August body of the Senate is that
we are the deliberative body and the
body that it takes four house members to
make to do the work of one state senator
you know uh and don't uh don't don't
stop reminding him of that but it's it's
just been a great honor to have served
in this body and to be a part of it for
as long as I have and to see the great
things that have happened in our great
state the number one state to do
business in economically and so many
Great accomplishments and I know that
we're in good hands with each of you and
I am proud and thankful for the
friendships that I have made in this
body and I encourage you to continue to
act justly walk humbly and love Mercy
thank you all very very much

so much good job
are there any unanimous consents
would any Senator wish to rise on a
point of personal privilege
senator from the eighth
thank you Mr President I just wanted to
share with my colleagues that tomorrow
in the Blue Room at the Depot from four
to six the University of Georgia College
of Agriculture environmental Sciences
legislative reception uh will be taking
place I hope you can join me there uh
Dean place has been doing a great job he
came down and spent a few nights at the
farm with me and and and when it went
and met with farmers and he's really
really engaged and uh I appreciate what
he's doing there
you know today is is National AG day and
uh
as you all know I'm pretty passionate
about agriculture
and my brother I've never spoken about
him I guess in this chamber but he's
eight years older than I am and he's
really one of my heroes
um he uh during the the 80s when things
were so bad on the farm he had to grow
up really fast and I remember when he
was 18 years old he planted 800 acres
with a John Deere 4230 with no heat
plate on the bottom of it and he's going
on to be very successful and uh the
other day we were at his farm and and my
son was with him and they were sitting
on the back of the tailgate and
he was kind of dispensing advice and you
know I was sitting there in my mind
recording it and I want I wanted to
share with you some of the things he
said
he said Son there's a whole lot more
money in farming the farmer than there
is in farming
Farmers work seven days a week so that
the people we do business with don't
have to
buy land and never sell it land is the
only form of wealth that lasts because
if you raise your kids on it they'll get
attached to it and won't want to sell it
it's the only good form of materialism
in life because it keeps your children
connected to you long after you're gone
always take good care of the land and
land will take good care of you don't
get addicted to building ponds because
you'll always be broke Always by assets
that appreciate and produce income
equipment isn't an asset because it goes
down in value over time equipment is
just a tool to create income to personal
an asset like land
if you ever get down on life get a
haircut if a haircut doesn't make you
feel better go buy a new pair of boots
if a new pair of boots doesn't do the
trick go buy yourself a new pickup and
if a new pickup doesn't make you feel
better you might need to see a
psychiatrist
you can take an old piece of equipment
and paint it up and put a bunch of money
in it but you'll just end up with a
pretty piece of junk
always try to help young people as you
get older whatever you do good or bad to
a young person they'll never forget it
the only way and I mean the only way one
man can be better than another man is to
outwork him if you ever have to borrow
something from someone more than once
you need to own what it is whatever it
is you're borrowing yourself invest in
irrigation and finally don't ever get in
too deep with a banker you want to be
able to make your own business decisions
and if you're in too deep with a banker
they'll be making your business
decisions for you and our farmers of
this state and across the country they
provide the food fiber and shelter but
it's the culture of Agriculture I think
that's its greatest contribution and to
our farmers of this state thank you God
bless you Mr President I yield the will
all right Senator thank you there's a
lot lots folks to learn from a
from a farmer now so a lot of good
wisdom

Senate resolution 334 by Senator Kennedy
over the 18th a resolution amending the
rules of the senate for other purposes
the senate committee on rules recommends
that this resolution do pass
respectively submitted by Senator brass
of the 28th district chairman that
completes the order Mr President
I recognize the pro tem to speak to the
resolution
good morning colleagues it's still this
morning and thank you Mr President for
recognizing me
this resolution Senate resolution 334 is
a product of the
member out of state travel memo that was
released March the 1st of this year
prior to my service to you as Pro tem a
study committee trip to Europe was
conducted where senate members use
Senate administrative funds for travel
expenses associated with a study
committee
upon being elected Pro tem and thank you
for that I became aware of this trip
through multiple media inquiries to our
office regarding the purpose of the
study committee the cost of the trip and
how the trip was funded
in cooperation with the secretary of the
Senate and the lieutenant governor and
his good staff a thorough overview of
the Senate rules associated with
out-of-state travel prompted me to
introduce this resolution to clarify and
strengthen the Senate's policy on
out-of-state travel for members and
staff at the expense of the senate or
for the use of Senate funds
this resolution really does three things
first of all at amends Senate rule 1-2.4
and in essence states that neither the
president of the Senate nor members
those of us in the Senate shall engage
in any travel outside the United States
at the expense of the Senate
additionally as part of that same change
in rule 1-2.4
it also provides that no member of the
Senate shall engage and travel outside
of Georgia but within the United States
at the expense of Senate funds unless
such travel has been approved in writing
by the committee on administrative
affairs
secondly a different rule well same real
number but a different approach rule
1-2.4
also provides that neither the president
of the Senate nor any other members of
the Senate
who are in their final six months of
term of office May travel outside the
state of Georgia at the expense of this
Senate
and third and finally real Dash 1-3.2
provides that no Senate staff members
shall engage in any travel outside the
United States at the expense of the
Senate and it also has the corollary
with regard to our staff members and
provides that no member of the Senate
shall engage in any travel outside of
Georgia but within the states at the
expense of the Senate again unless that
travel is approved in writing by the
committee on administrative affairs
it is imperative that tax dollars be
used to further the work of this body
as we work for the taxpayers these
Senate funds allow us to better the
lives of Georgians produce good
legislation and operate efficiently
as long as I'm privileged to serve in
this position I will work to ensure that
taxpayer dollars are used effectively in
this chamber and that all funds for
travel are tied to a specific
legislative purpose
now let me be clear I do not want and it
is not the intent of the president of
this Senate nor the rules that we
operate under to dissuade our members
and staff from being and going and
learning from our colleagues across the
state lines or for that matter across
the pond as Georgia's success is the
number one state in which to do business
is deeply tied to the international
economy
but the funds that we use for
legislative operations belong to the
people of Georgia
and they are counting on us to make a
difference during our service to this
state in their lives
colleagues I appreciate the bipartisan
input and support that I have received
in crafting this resolution and it is my
hope that we can all take pride in what
we're doing here today
and we want to further emphasize my
appreciation to the president of the
Senate and his staff for the great work
that he did in cooperating with the pro
tems office in crafting this rule change
and fashioning the policy that we need
to operate under going forward and
making sure that we've got guard rails
that the members ensure that we operate
within those guard rails as we travel
forward in our service of the great
people of Georgia I hope that these new
Senate rules provide Clarity to help the
Senate reach a new standard of service
for the people that we represent back
home that we call our beloved
constituents
with that Mr President I'm happy to
answer questions or I'll be happy to
yield the well you have no questions
Senator thank you I urge your support
and I appreciate all the good work that
so many of you have had in the
conversations with me and my office on
how we need to do this with regard to
these particular rule changes thank you
the Zinnia Senator wish to speak for
against the measure

Senator has moved that the Senate agree
to the house substitute on Senate Bill
140. secretary read the caption
Senate Bill 140 by Senator Summers of
the 13th and others a bill between child
and act to amend Article 1 of chapter 7
of Title 31 of the official code of
Georgia annotated relating to regulation
of hospitals and related institutions so

chapter 7 of Title 31 of the official
code of Georgia annotated relating to
regulation of hospitals and related
institutions so as prohibits certain
surgical procedures for the treatment of
gender dysphoria and minors
that completes the order Mr President
senators from 13th has
moved that the Senate's agree to the
substitute on Senate Bill 140 is their
objection there is objection from
senator from the 41st
I recognize the senator from the 13th to
speak to the bill and then the senator
from the 41st you'll have an opportunity
to speak after the senator from 13.
senator
thank you Mr President
colleagues today once again we're back
in the whale here discussing Senate bill
140.
I'm sure you all have read Senate Bill
140 from cover to cover at least a dozen
times I know I have
I want you to understand where I come
from with Senate Bill 140 and I want you
to tell you how honestly how
compassionate I feel that we are truly
protecting the lives of children by not
offering the life-altering drugs and of
course the surgeries that are completely
irreversible
I ask you your favorite consent on
Senate Bill 140 and I look forward to
you know to looking people straight in
the eye and tell them that I am
compassionate to their plea and I
understand their passion but we're doing
the right thing by being and protecting
children and that Senate Bill 140 Mr
President and I yield well
I recognize senator from the 41st
thank you Mr President I respectfully
ask that you all would vote no on this
agree the house came back and made it so
that doctors would now be held
criminally and simply liable for simply
doing their jobs for following the
medical advice that has been peer
reviewed and that is used as standards
that are used across this nation and so
not only are doctors now being put at
Jeopardy but also our children still
stand at risk I understand the
compassion that senator from the 13th
has for our youth we obviously disagree
our children are at risk when they're
not given access to the hormone therapy
that they need in order to properly
manage their gender dysphoria and so
again I urge you all as an act of
compassion to to vote now thank you
I will yield for questions
senator from the
it's from the 36 we'd like to ask a
question
thank you Mr President to the senator do
you yield yes I do thank you um are you
able to point out what changed the house
made and the bill
so that we may uh fully understand
what the new SB 140 has amended by the
house contains yes thank you for that
question so the line removed the
original bill that the senator from the
13th brought to us provided immunity to
doctors and medical personnel who
continue to provide care to these
children who need it and the house
stripped that immunity which now
therefore opens medical personnel to
lawsuits not just civilly but also
criminal
liability if they were to prescribe
hormone treatments for these youth or to
assist in any type of surgeries thank
you for that further question yes
the the language in the bill also uh
calls for the Department to establish
sanctions for violations of the code
section up to and including the
revocation of an institution's permit
that I believe applies to hospitals am I
correct that is correct
so that this bill isn't true contains a
very heavy
hammering Rod against the against the
medical profession and against
institutions that offer uh Health Care
uh to our Georgia patients the senator
knows of what she speaks that is correct
this is a very heavy hand that comes
against the medical the medical industry
for for simply doing their job for
living into their oath of caring for
those who are in need of care
and further question if you'll yield I
will yield the the list of organizations
and groups that are child serving
organizations uh is long uh including
The Academy of Pediatricians other
members of the medical community and
medical organizations is it not true
that have come before the committee and
the process of this bill being
considered
in both Chambers and pleaded
for us to not take this Draconian step
and send the message of marginalization
and negativity to parents and their
children who are addressing this trans
issue that's correct and that is correct
uh the members of the committee were
provided with a letter from a from 500
doctors
representing pediatric pediatricians and
those who are in the endocrinologists in
this state to express their strong
desire that we not pass this legislation
in addition to that there have been
hundreds of parents and Advocates and
youth who have come and asked and spoken
out on behalf of themselves and on
behalf of others asking that parents
have the right to make this choice this
medical decision for their children in
the same way that we talk about parents
rights for Education
these parents have asked quite strongly
and firmly that they be allowed to have
the right to make medical decisions on
behalf of their youth
thank you
I will further yield for questions if
there are any there are a few questions
here Senator Senator from the 14th
thank you Mr President Senator yield yes
Senator is it not true that when this
legislation gets litigated in court that
the argument that the people challenging
it are likely to be successful in making
is that for decades in this country
courts have recognized the right for
families and parents to make the right
decisions for their own kids
irrespective of what politicians want
because of the fundamental
constitutional rights that they have to
their own family's privacy is that not
true a senator that is correct there are
several instances already in which these
bills have already been challenged and
we do know that ultimately this will be
rendered unconstitutional and last
question Senator if you would yield I
will yield thank you Senator is it also
not further true
that and not speaking of the folks in
this room and their intentions but some
of the groups that push this type of
legislation is it not true that they
more or less specialize in finding
divisive cultural issues that fortify
one party's base and that as this body
moves through more and more of those
issues in an attempt to satiate those
groups that they will have to look for
more and more cultural issues to depend
upon to shore up their political base is
that not true the senator knows of what
he speaks and raises an important point
one of the things that I think is most
grossly discussing about the situation
is that we are using children as pawns
we are using children to really push
push forward work that it's under the
guise of compassion and I do believe
that the sincerity of some of the
members in this room but broadly
speaking this really is about us
bullying children in order to score
political points and and that to me is
extraordinarily disheartening I
understand that people fundamentally
want to protect children but when the
overwhelming medical professionals have
come in and said this does not help
children this harms children this
increases their likelihood of committing
suicide and yet you continue to push
forward I'm clear it's no longer about
children anymore it's about something
different than that thank you senator
recognize senator from the 53rd for a
question
well the senator yelled yes to my good
friend from a Fifth Third is it not true
that Senate Bill 140 actually protects
trans kids from genital mutilation
Senator it is not protect children who
are experiencing gender dysphoria from
receiving the care that they need
children who are experiencing gender
gender dysphoria need particular care
that a medical professional can provide
I think it's also really important that
we state that in the state of Georgia
children are not receiving these types
of surgeries and our largest contention
our largest issue with this bill is
withholding drugs withholding hormone
therapy from youth who need this we've
been very clear that providing puberty
blockers access to puberty blockers
without additional access to hormone
replacement therapy is actually harmful
for children and so you're in effect
actually not even providing them with
with puberty blockers because they can
only be on them for a limited period of
time this conversation for me is
fundamentally it is not about stopping
surgery surgeries are not happening in
this state this is about making sure
that children have access to hormone
therapy the hormone therapy that they
need hormone therapy that many adults
sitting in this room right now are
receiving because we've aged into a
certain part of our our kind of our our
our lifetime where we need additional uh
we need additional hormones right these
are hormones that people in this room
are using we are asking for access to
hormones for these youth because they
need it because they're experiencing
gender dysphoria because they look in
the mirror and they see reflected back
to them an image that is not true to who
they are they see reflected back to an
image that calls on them to ask for help
to ask for their parents to ask for
doctors and Physicians to give them
interventions in order for them to feel
safe and good in their own bodies this
conversation is not about genital
mutilation it is about access to
hormones and our children deserve to
have access to the medical care that
they need in the same way that we give
medical care for other issues that
people are experiencing that's what this
conversation is about and I think it's
important that we be clear about this we
are not fighting about genital
mutilation we are fighting about
medication and we are fighting to make
sure that children don't go on a black
market and receive dirty and tainted
hormones because we will not allow them
to receive good and safe hormones in
this state in the same way that I can go
and get good and safe hormones if I need
them children need access to that as
well
senator from the 26th
senator from 26 says weighed 7 from 28.
you have a question
thank you Mr President Senator do you
yield yes to the rules chairman thank
you um
you keep mentioning that the doctors one
of the changes in the bills was doctors
are now going to be held criminally
responsible can you point to that in the
bill because I'm not seeing it right so
if you remember that if you refer to the
bill that we passed out of this body it
explicitly says that doctors will not be
held civilly or criminally liable so
what the house did was that they
stripped that language or rent out so
it's now silent so by not providing
immunity to our doctors what we in
effect do is open them up to these types
of charges do you further yield
absolutely so the bill does not say that
they're criminally liable
the bill opens up the possibility for
someone to be charged because it does
not extend immunity but still does not
say they're criminally liable is that
yes or no that is correct the bill does
not say those words
Senator Senator from the 26 you hit your
button again he's you're still in the
posture waving
all right
Senator you have no further questions
well that I will yell thank you Senator
recognize senator from the first speak
to the bill
thank you Mr President uh you know
Senate Bill 140 is a very uh challenging
bill it has been something that has been
heavy on the hearts for everyone in this
chamber uh I think we have struck a good
balance here I do take issue with the
difference in hormones in in adults who
are over who are in this chamber or much
older than age 18 years old I certainly
think that no one in this chamber has
any issues at all with hormone
replacement therapy from that standpoint
but what we're doing here is we're
preventing minors
under 18 years old from having
irreversible changes in their lives
these changes whether it's surgical
which could be done and can be done here
in the state of Georgia or whether it's
hormone replacement therapy I.E
testosterone or estrogen those give
irreversible changes to the minors or
the child's body that's something that
as an adult as a parent
they many times won't help with that
we've had testimony here that suggests
that and I think that it's important for
us to recognize that we're certainly not
denying that for any adults but it is
for minors for irreversible changes
whether it's surgery or hormones that's
what we're preventing
as with the changes that were done in
Committee in public health in the house
side yes from an immunity standpoint
that portion was removed and it is
silent in there the Physicians were
still held civilly liable from a
malpractice standpoint and the question
is should we be held as a physician
should we be excused from criminal or
civil conduct and I certainly have
angst or I have challenges related to
that but I think that in the end I think
that from a criminal or civil standpoint
we should never be above the law by any
means and I think that's a very
important distinction I'll give you an
example uh with Michael Jackson and we
think we all may remember that his
cardiologist who was taking care of him
at the time as a as really as a primary
care physician allowed him to use
anesthesia for sleep at night
that was not malpractice that was
Criminal
and indeed he was convicted and indeed
he served time for that I think he may
still be serving time for that that is
what we're discussing when we're
relating to that Physicians should not
be above the law uh
and by any means Mr President I would
ask for your favorable consideration
relating to this bill I think it does
protect minors from irreversible changes
when it comes to hormones and when it
comes to surgery and I think it's the
right thing to do thank you
Senator has yielded
centered from the 42nd you wish to speak
to the bill
thank you Mr President I rise today
colleagues to State and explain my
strong opposition to this piece of
legislation I voted against it the first
time it was before us and it's probably
not a surprise that I will be voting
against it this time
um my colleagues the center from the
40th and center from the 41st spoke
eloquently about this legislation the
first time we heard it and I believe the
senator from the 41st did so again for
all of us who oppose this piece of
legislation that seeks to control
parents and doctors
one of the issues that I have is that
the majority in this body is building a
reputation for talking out of both sides
of its mouth without any shame
on the one hand there's a lot of talk
about trusting parents to make the best
decisions for their children
when it comes to all sorts of things
what schools they can attend covid
whether or not they should wear masks
what food they eat what camps they go to
any other Myriad other medical decisions
School curriculum what can be taught by
teachers in schools what books may be
appropriate to have in school libraries
and the list goes on and on
but here we are usurping parents rights
on one particular issue a very private
particular issue a very private
particular medical issue
the body that has waded into all those
things that I just listed is now telling
parents they don't have the right to
access medical care for their child this
is the definition of hypocrisy
the rule does seem to be that we are for
parental rights when those parents make
decisions we agree with
and when we don't like the decisions
they make then we intend to Outlaw those
decisions
as if taking away parents rights weren't
enough
SB 140 as amended prevents doctors from
doing their job according to
Professional Standards
and threatening them
with criminal action or civil liability
if they do so
these are the very doctors we rely on
and Trust when facing our darkest
moments when our health is endangered
this bill
in addition to usurping
parental rights
usurps doctors Professional Standards
requiring them to go against the
American Academy of Pediatrics and the
American Psychological Association just
to name two
or face legal and reputational
consequences
listen Maybe under many or even most
circumstances
it would be advisable for a young person
in consultation with their parents and
their doctor to wait before considering
surgery or or hormonal treatment perhaps
that perhaps that might be the case but
it's undeniable that that is not true in
one hundred percent of the instances
that face parents and doctors across our
state it is undeniably true that there
are circumstances for the more than 11
million people here in Georgia where it
actually is medically advisable to help
that child
be who they are
and be able to continue their life here
in this state
in a way that engages them to it to to
interact authentically with their world
and the problem with having a blunt
instrument like that is you leave no
room
there is no room left for those very
small instances maybe it is only a few
where it is 100 medically advisable and
I dare say that almost every single
person in this chamber when faced with
the fact pattern that we know is out
there would say yes in this instance in
this one instance it is better to allow
the doctors and the parents to work with
this child and make this decision
but you're saying no
because it's just vague it's vague well
it's not a good idea maybe it's not most
of the time but I guarantee you that I
could get up here with a fact pattern
and you would say nope that's right in
this instance that was the right thing
to do so shame on you
for inserting yourself
so directly with that one family
hope no one ever does that to you
this bill is addressing an issue that we
only barely are starting to understand
which is another reason it's
inappropriate to rush down here with a
blunt instrument that treats all
situations the same when we know that
they are not
gender identity of Youth with gender
dysphoria
needs a lot more thoughtful study and
learning and less less arrogance and
hubris
right because otherwise all it shows us
is that it all it is is a cultural issue
because it's not a sincere attempt it's
not a sincere attempt to engage with any
sort of actual understanding of gender
dysphoria as it spans
all different types of people there is
no one-size-fits all y'all there just
isn't so that does demonstrate the
insincerity of this bill
because it demonstrates that really what
we're talking about is cultural changes
that make people uncomfortable and that
they just would prefer not to see
so instead of studying the issue with an
open mind to listen and learn we're
closing doors creating far more problems
that reach beyond our base of knowledge
and Authority
there are no Solutions on offer here
for any of it for any of the problems
raised
just a sledgehammer that smashes it a
few fragile youth
shatters their parents and doctors
efforts to engage in any kind of a
conversation that could support them in
a thorough and authentic way and then
sweep it all under the rug
I urge you to vote against sb40 and to
recognize these parents these children
and most importantly our own limitations
thank you Mr President I'll take
questions if you have no questions thank
you Senators yield of the well senator
from the night should we speak to the
bill
thank you
thank you Mr President and I'm going to
Echo some things that have already been
said but I think some of these things
can't be said enough
of course I am standing in opposition of
this bill
you know
we are
at the end of the day we are picking on
kids
we're targeting a vulnerable group of
children
I think is mean
I think it's insensitive
I think
if we're going to pick on somebody let's
pick on some something some people are
on size
I have plenty of Corporations we can go
after why trans kids every every time
why trans kids why
and I can't get a clear answer as to why
other than we just can we just can't
this body just chooses to do it
not only that now we want to punish
doctors for doing
what they are trained to do is to save
lives is to give Medical Care
maybe it doesn't explicitly say
criminalize but we are talking about
maybe removing their licensing
punishing them
for helping
and trying to do the jobs that they have
studied their lifetimes to do
we continue to push the alternative
narratives this is based on political
expediency
as stated by a member of our chamber on
crossover day you can't simultaneous
simultaneously have do two different
things be true
last session
our chamber passed a bill enshrining
parental rights over their children's
education and development
I know I was sitting right here when it
happened
today we're debating the rights
appearance to protect to protect their
children's mental health and their
physical wellness
our Chambers has fought restrictions on
freedom of medical Choice throughout the
pandemic
all we debated last year in the year
before but we continue to take away the
freedom of medical professionals and
citizens to make choices about their
health the health of their family the
health of their children
make no mistake
these decisions are closely monitored
and guided by medical professionals
Guided by medical profession it's not
like kids are getting them off the
streets but you know now
I don't know what'll happen if we pass
this legislation they might turn to
means that are harmful but right now
it's under the guidance of medical
professionals
and these aren't decisions that are
reached off hand
they're not handing out
you know and and Advising just
off-handed these people or medical
professions they have studied they know
what they're doing and we should leave
it in their hands to do it
and finally did we not prioritize Mental
Health Care last session
bipartisan
and there is no doubt around the data
that shows that even having this debate
is damaging to children youth and even
adults with gender dysphoria again we're
picking on a vulnerable group of people
for political scoring points
the people that we're picking on on are
they have turned to self-harm before
and suicides
and it is directly associated with
restrictive laws just like this
in our Chambers voting history shows
that our values do not align with this
bill I mean I'm getting with Whiplash
which one do you guys want parental
rights or not
to quote the senator from the 27th on
March 6 2023
I know all of us love our kids
and I know that if we were asked all of
you if you were able to make the best
decision for your child
every one of you will say yes
so let's trust
the rest of Georgia parents
to do the same
unless the side
in this body let's stay consistent at
least
in this body if it's parental rights
let's make sure we're upholding parental
rights if that's what y'all believe
and with that Mr President I will take
Chris questions do you have no questions
Senator at yoga well Senators yield with
Wells I recognize senator from the six
Mr President I Rise to speak against the
motion and to plea with
my colleagues in this chamber that we
focus our time on critical issues that
are impacting hard-working Georgians
across the state
I want to start by sending my love and
appreciation to all of the individuals
who have ensured that their voices
would be heard throughout this debate
and
send my love and appreciation to those
individuals who are directly impacted by
this bill
to the transgender Youth and to their
families
I am sorry
I am sorry that this body has failed you
because if this body really wanted to do
something to help transgender
individuals and their families
we'd be providing Mental Health
Resources
we'd be providing more resources
to help these individuals
instead what this bill does is take away
critical resources at a critical time
for these people
what this bill also does is that it
takes away
critical Focus
and critical time that this body has to
address issues
that are important and that are
impacting everyday hard-working
Georgians each and every day
education
Health Care
housing jobs imagine if we had spent
the energy that has been spent on this
bill
on the half million Georgians that don't
have insurance
imagine if we had spent the time and
energy and the hours of backroom dealing
and whipping
that was spent on this bill
on addressing the needs that we have in
our rural communities and the
Investments that all of our communities
need
across the state
and I've heard that there's some sort of
moral and religious imperative to help
these children
but if we had
that imperative and took it seriously
then there are over four hundred
thousand children in Georgia living in
poverty
that need our attention
there are over 8 000 children in foster
care that need our attention today
there are 60 percent of children in this
state that are not reading on grade
level
by the third grade that need our
attention today
but instead
we spent
hours
and caucus positions
dealing with a bill that does nothing
more than put lives
of transgender children at risk
I want to close by acknowledging the
parents and families of these children
because throughout this debate I didn't
hear a lot of faith in parents
I didn't hear a lot of trust in the
ability of parents to work with doctors
to figure out what is best for their
kids to figure out how to best meet
their needs
and to Echo
what my colleague from the ninth
mentioned
I know that we all love our kids
and I know that if I asked any of you
do you think that you would be
the one to make the best decision for
your child every single one of you would
say yes
so I'm asking you
to trust Georgia parents to do the same
and vote no vote nay on this motion Mr
President
you do have a couple questions Senator
if you but you yield well yield the will
as soon as yielded senator from the
seventh
thank you Mr President
I rise today in opposition to Senate
bill 140.
rather than working to address our
affordable housing crisis or fighting
for Working Families this bill seeks to
deny our transgender youth some of their
most Essential Health Care needs
SB 140 would make it harder for parents
to care for their children and make it
hard for doctors to care for their
patients physical and emotional needs
any national survey one in five trans
youth said that they attempted suicide
but gender gender affirming Services
could cut that risk in half
gender affirming care is life-saving
care
protecting children means protecting all
of our children so I stand with the
people of Georgia urging that this
chamber does not pass this bill
we must protect marginalized groups not
embolden discrimination against our
lgbtq community
some of the members across the aisle
want us to trust parents to dictate the
books and lessons in our schools and yet
they refuse to trust parents to make
medical decisions
but it's not just our youth that this
bill would hurt
Georgia has one of the highest maternal
mortality rates and Georgia continues to
fail our rural communities with our
inability to recruit doctors
and yet this bill would hold
administerably administratively liable
the very doctors we need the most
even possibly causing them to lose their
license
this bill is wrong
and I urge my colleagues to live to
Georgia's
motto of values of wisdom Justice in
moderation and vote against this Bill
thank you Mr President I yield a well
Senator has yielded the well
senator from the 36 which rise
thank you Mr President
colleagues I've shared with you the
other morning from the well and points
of personal privilege that one of my
early texts that I received uh by phone
that day that morning was from my pastor
urging me to be a voice for the families
across Georgia and Across the Nation
that are moved to address
supporting their child
who's transitioning
the second text that stood out that
morning not much not much further than
when my pastor's text arrived
is from uh
a family dear friends longtime neighbors
live two blocks away
uh
our wonderful
backbone people in our community
and the the proud parents of two
children
and my neighbor said please stand tall
on this issue please do anything you can
to keep Senate Bill 140 from becoming
the law of the land
uh and and she described how one of her
two children her older child
has transitioned and is a female and how
what a difference it made for them to be
able to make their own decisions about
their child's situation to be fully
supportive I want to stop and salute the
families
who say yes and affirm their children's
self-knowledge when they come to their
parent and say this is true for me
I want to affirm those families that
stand tall and I want to ask you
in this chamber
we have heard from early on last year
and again this year the very compelling
story
of one of our
colleagues
from DeKalb County
the senator from the 40th
who movingly
shared her own story
the own personal story of the the
Journey of her family
as they moved into this space that they
never knew or what they were going to
encounter
and she has asked us to listen to
the honest findings the pathway that she
and her child and her husband and her
family have been on
and she has given us a compelling story
and I and I ask you can that not move
you from the abstract discussion of
whether you want to pile on with this
bill that the GOP is pushing in States
across the country
or do you want to listen
to a dear colleague who contributes
mightily who works hard every day who
comes down here and brings her total
honest self and stands up
for those who need an advocate at the at
the uh under the gold Dome
and that colleague has asked you to
listen to her story as a parent
are you really comfortable just
closing the door on that
somehow
discrediting
that honest
and compelling story that she shared now
for two years
it's very personal that that makes it
very personal here
and thankfully we've come to the point
in the legislature it wasn't this way
when I got here but we've come to the
point down here where members of
different communities are getting
elected and bringing their voices that
were formerly never seen here people of
Muslim faith people of immigrant
backgrounds uh
lgbtq community members
and parents
of trans children
their voices are here with us not
somewhere else not across the street not
just in an article that you read or
something on TV
these are our colleagues sharing their
family stories
sharing their life experience
and I urge you open your hearts and
listen
how how can you how can you deny that
fundamental truth that we've heard
coming from this well
from our own colleague from the 40th
District elected and re-elected by her
constituents loved and admired and
cherished for the work that she does
down here on behalf of those in need
can you hear that voice
can you understand this is a real person
a real family someone we know and
respect right here in our midst and the
same occurred on the over on the house
side I would say as well when people
shared their stories
I was so struck
by the contradiction that on one day
Suicide Prevention Day occurred down
here at the Capitol
I had constituents come down to have
lost their own children to suicide and
who have stepped into that
space of being a voice and an advocate
for us doing everything we can to
prevent suicide
the next day
the house did what they did on SB 40. SB
140.
when we know and the data is clear and
the statistics are there that trans
youth who are experience marginalization
and being pushed to the side
being bullied being taunted being
made to feel less than
our very statistically
susceptible
to suicide attempts
so the stakes are high here folks
that this isn't just about another one
another bill that we're going to take a
look at and then we're going to cast our
vote the stakes are high you are
impacting real families real people real
children you're also you're also
impacting negatively
the Health Care community that provides
services
needed services
for transgendered youth
so I ask you
if are you comfortable with that is it
you're still going to vote your caucus
position
think twice
this is a vote you're going to live with
the rest of your life and when you go
back to your District it won't be long
maybe a little bit maybe a few weeks
maybe next year maybe in Sunday school
maybe standing outside under the oak
tree after church
but you are going to hear
from families in your District
who gonna
share their pain with you
that this was the decision that you made
this was how you chose to vote
when the data is clear
and when as our colleague from the 42nd
pointed out there is much more to unfold
on this pathway of fully learning and
understanding this dynamic in our
population
I urge you
to reconsider supporting this bill you
may have voted in your caucus to support
it
it's the wrong thing to do
you're damaging real children
damaging real families
insulting the medical community in my
opinion
and Paving the way
for children who are denied access
to medically necessary hormonal
treatment
you're Paving you're Paving the way
for incidents of suicide among our youth
all of this is this is a very heavy
heavy decision that you're making as you
cast this vote and I would
plead with you
to think about it differently possibly
than you have thus far
and again we have colleagues in our
midst
who can share reality with you if you're
not in touch with it thank you
Mr President and if the no questions
I'll yield the well you do have a
question Senator Senator from the 40th
of course thank you Mr President um
senator
true that even if you're a senator
sitting in this body and you really do
sincerely feel that you are helping and
not harming children that you still
might want to consider that
you're about to pass a law that is
unconstitutional
I think you make an excellent point
senator from the 40th uh and at Bedrock
that will take us into court battles
that have in other states
prevailed in
ruling that this fails to meet uh
constitutional rights exactly and is it
not true that that will take use
precious tax dollars and that the
arguments would be such that these are
some of these surgeries are surgeries
that
non-transgender children also seek and
that you are singling out a particular
set of people and saying that they
cannot have access to surgeries that
some other
minors do have access to which could be
a challenge under the 14th Amendment
I believe the senator makes a very
compelling point
and it just Escapes Me
how we think we can practice medicine we
weren't elected to practice medicine
good people
we have
some of the finest medical schools in
the country right here in our state and
incredible doctors and a health care
infrastructure that we need to get
behind and and uh
push forward and fund and
this is not the approach that does that
putting politicians
in the doctor's office with a parent and
their child do you further yields I do
yield is it your understanding that
there could be unintended consequences
to this bill and that we are not medical
professionals but we are
putting children in a situation where
they could end up having to be on
puberty blockers longer than they should
be because they cannot make the
transition to hormone replacement
therapy and that perhaps we should take
a deeper look at this in order to
prevent very real
um
unintended consequences
um
that's a question yes I I I'm in
complete agreement with the the senator
from the 40th and that is a
exactly an underlying point in this
whole bill debate is the damage that it
does the damage that it does and it
affects real people and one more
question yes I yield uh is it not true
that
um I Heard very recently
um that out by the ropes
um that even our Georgia's attorney
general has said that this law is
unconstitutional
that's very important to know and I'm
pleased that you shared that that's not
something that I was aware of but
it speaks volumes does it not yes it
does thank you I have no more questions
thank you so no more questions I'll
yield a well
you did have you did have a question
Senator but if you yielded you have that
right too
good question
senator from the 53rd recognizable
question my name is president with
cinder yield I yield to the senator from
the 53rd Senator the people of the
Northwest are getting quite upset with
some of the things you're saying or can
you clarify for me do you believe that
genital mutilation is a necessary
surgery for Youth and minors I think
that you are using a a supercharged
Banner
with a gentle lady or I'm sorry with the
general Senator I believe I believe that
you're using a supercharged term that
has been politicized and you're using it
deliberately to
stir that up
this is not about genital mutilation
this is not about genital mutilation not
at all well the senator further yield so
maybe you can explain that hopefully to
your constituents yes I'll yield to the
gentleman when it comes to the
constitutionality of this wasn't it your
caucus that submitted legislation a
couple years ago that would ban
electroshock therapy for or any type of
surgery for those under 16 would that
have been constitutional
let me say to you that I don't at all
recall my caucus introducing a bills
such as you described you there may be
an individual member of this body here
or across the hall that introduced
legislation referring to but no caucus
uh that I'm in has taken that position
or filed that bill
thank you very much
you have one more questions
uh Democratic leader
with the senator yield I do isn't it
true Senator that we have a law against
the general mutilation
you're absolutely correct and it isn't
also true that I passed it
the the senator knows where she speaks
case closed
thank you very much search your hearts
search your hearts I attended a rally
yesterday of
people from my church and uh other other
Faith leaders uh met and spoke with many
families with the Trans kids
met and spoke with a trans kids who had
been here and sought the ear of some of
you and felt that sometimes a rather
chilly reception but it was a again
another eye-opening experience if you
can open your hearts open your eyes look
at the facts uh there's a right way to
vote on this bill and that is to not
move forward vote no on Senate Bill 140.
thank you
the senator has yielded the whale
recognize the senator from the 42nd you
will speak
I arise to make a motion
Mr President
yes like to move that we table SB 140.
the senator has moved that
the Senate table Senate bill 140.
unfortunately Senator that motion is not
debatable on this I believe you have a
motion that will that will be acceptable
right now from coming from your
colleague right here senator from the
14th thank you Mr President I moved to
adjourn
the senator has moved to adjourn
is their objection
we have an objection all those in favor
of the motion to adjourn
will vote yay all those oppose we'll
vote no
secretary will unlock the machine
this vote only requires a majority of
the of the quorum
a simple majority
own the motion to adjourn the yeas are
20 and the Nays are 31 so that motion
has failed
Senator would you still like to speak
okay so I recognize the senator from the
14th to speak to the bill
thank you Mr President
um I know the feeling
of a quiet chamber in which the vote is
baked it is one of the most familiar
feelings in the house some of my fellow
members can agree with me on that I know
the feeling of getting up to get orange
juice or a milk or a soda because you
know that a long floor debate is coming
because it's not going to change the
result because either there are caucus
positions or we're tired of listening to
each other I get it because I get tired
of listening to colleagues when enough
time passes or I go to the ante room go
to the bathroom crack a joke grab a soda
but I think today it is a particularly
Salient feeling to be on the floor with
empty seats because this result is
already baked
and the reason is it's a metaphor
for silence the silence that trans kids
here when they say no this issue is not
going away I do not just want to be an
astronaut which is by the way a comment
that I heard indirectly and I don't
remember who but there was a senator who
told somebody on the ropes that when
they were a kid they wanted to be an
astronaut and compare that to this
this is not that
I mean that's that's almost an offense I
mean it is an offensive comparison
but the reason we don't know in this
chamber that it's an offensive
comparison is because we're not in
community with those kids
I'm not just talking about Republicans I
mean Democrats too there are a couple
people in this room and you have heard
from them who have the ability to speak
to what it's like
to be in community with trans children
to actually listen to them and
understand that this is not a phase
this is not something that is casual or
or like a like a job that they want when
they grow up
this is their life this is who they are
to say anything else is Erasure
it's to say that those people don't
exist do you understand that those are
the stakes for these kids
this isn't a colored bag that they
picked to bring to school this is not
something that they do to rebel against
their parents
this is their entire life
and that's why they take it that's why
they kill themselves
when they don't get this care
it's really that simple
foreign
We come running back in because of a
motion to adjourn we're ready to show up
when it's time to keep our grip on power
but we're not ready to show up when it's
time to let those messages in
when it's time to listen to the people
in the hallway do you know that the
people in the hallway Lobby me like I'm
a member of the majority
they act like I'm about to vote Yes on
this do you know why they act that way
because I'm the only one who's listening
to him
at least in that moment they've got
plenty of people to listen to this
building don't get me wrong and I don't
want to undersell the importance of the
people who have gone the ropes of both
parties I acknowledge both parties have
gone to the ropes there are Advocates
who listen to this this messaging every
day but the truth is the reason that 90
million of your colleagues just went to
the well to speak to an empty room it's
not that we want our media hits FR media
hits
it's because there's a message from
these children that is not getting
through to this space
it is being blocked and all of us are
like struggling to figure out how to get
that message into this room
and we're not very good at it because
there's big doors right there
and because we aren't Trans in this room
I don't think we have a trans member
so there's this barrier and we're doing
everything we can to get the right
messaging to the people who make the
decisions but we're failing and today
we've failed
and there and the caucus will the
Republican caucus will lock down and it
will vote Yes and this bill will pass
and the governor will sign it and it
will be litigated
and we will go back to our corners and
keep doing the same crap we always do
when there is a divisive partisan
culture War issue
at issue and in the meantime kids will
die
kids will commit suicide
kids will feel that they're not being
heard that their basic existence is
being invalidated erased
and the maybe the closest metaphor that
any of us could possibly get close to to
understand what that's like in a million
years
is the silence on the senate floor when
half the Senate is gone having a coffee
because we already know the result thank
you Mr President yield the well
Senator has yielded the well senator
from the 34th
we'd like to speak senator
sorry Mr President
I rise in opposition of this bill but I
want to share
a story with you all
um
a few years back
some kids had asked me if they could
meet with me
and of course I'm their Senator so of
course I met with them
and it was only five of them
but I was down in Fayette County
and they attended
um Sandy Creek High School
and I said so what can I help you with
and they said
well
we need to
become a club
and the young lady who started she said
and by the way I'm bi and I say it's a
pleasure to meet you bye
turns out that wasn't her name
the kids educated me on that day
they were trying to start a club like
the other clubs at their school
for
the
gingerbread anybody know anything about
the Gingerbread
okay let me share with what I learned
I told them I was not aware of all of
what they were talking about even as
adults I just was unaware and I'm not
ashamed to say I don't know everything
but they drew me a gingerbread to tell
me the different types and I had never
seen it and nobody had ever talked to me
about it so clueless but it was an
interesting conversation
but after listening to them
I merely did what most of you would do
and that was to reach out to the school
and find out where the barriers are
keeping this group of kids from having
their own club
when I learned the rules of starting a
club at the school I got back with them
and I shared with them the steps that it
would take you know they have to have a
sponsor and they have to have all these
things to become a club and I'm assuming
because this has been a few years back
that the club may still exist at Sandy
Creek High School because of my
intervention because all I wanted to do
was to have a Level Playing Field these
were kids kids who I had identified with
each other they wanted to find a club
just like all the other clubs at the
school
and when they got one they were so happy
they thought I was the bomb they told me
you know I listened to them
and worked on their behalf so that they
can have a club now
the bipart
they gave me the ginger red so I could
learn
and being better aware
why are we dictating
instead of listening and helping
I'll tell you why
I've been saying this for years
I've been in this chamber more than 20
years
and I know it's a joke of sort
but when I was growing up in Herndon
homes my brother got a chance to join
the boys club
and I cried because my mother said you
can't join the boys club
even though my mother's in heaven she'd
be proud to know that I'm now a member
of the boys club
some of y'all get it but the rest of
y'all tomorrow you may understand thank
you but at any rate I am here to say
that we consistently are attacking
things that are none of your business
these are our children
if we make a bad decision look in your
own self and see how many bad decisions
you've made
but by and large we can live with it
because it's ours to make
but I'm gonna leave on this note
I hope your districts are looking at all
of this stuff you all are just pushing
through because you have the numbers
and I hope they're lining up to replace
you
because I'm gonna give mine up so it's
all good
but you all have got to start
representing all of Georgia particularly
your district and my question
in leaving have you even spoken to your
District to get a consensus
on what it is there when we're all in
this together
period
we are all elected and we are all human
and we are all adults
so I urge my colleagues
to stop trying to legislate everything
because you got the numbers
because hopefully in the future when I'm
gone we'll turn it back over
like
former lieutenant governor Casey Cagle
was talking about dims being in
controlled and had the power when we get
it back it's going to be another new day
but we're not going to be as
mean-spirited as you all are I'll yield
the well
Senators yielded well recognize the
majority leader

40-5-57.2
40-5-63
40-5-7540-5-121 or
42-8-1211 that completes the order Mr
President
hey Josh
thank you Mr President House Bill 120 is
an agency Bill to Simply make a couple
of cleanups so if someone is past due on
child support this will allow them to
apply for a temporary permit as you can
imagine while we find it terrible that
anyone is behind their child payments
what we don't want to do is give them no
ability to get to work in order to make
payments on there and the courts have
several ways in order to make sure that
that's taken care of also in relation to
DUIs by error back in 2000 House Bill
799
remove the language that prohibited
someone who is charged with either DUI
or drugs from having the opportunity to
apply for reinstatement or a limited
driving permits this allows for that
process to go back into order as it was
in the past it's a very simple Bill a
cleanup for our great men and women who
work in Department Driver Services there
are no questions I'll yield the will
you have no questions Senator thank you
recognize senator from the 14th
foreign
thank you Mr President I promise we'll
get out of here today in time for the
center for the 50th child swim practice
but um
this is a funny one y'all because
this bill in its current form defeats
itself
uh it allows for limited driving permits
for folks who are out of compliance with
their child support
but then if you look at line 76 or 78
it says that if you're out of compliance
with your child support
it's a mandatory revocation of that
exact same limited driving permit
well that's a that's a problem so just
flagging that for everybody it's going
to put DDS in a really tough spot
because you know they now they don't
make the decision right the the folks
who handle child support they're the
ones who make the decision about whether
somebody's driver's permit should be
rescinded or not but what it basically
means is at least for the next year
we're gonna have to worry about whether
child support is arbitrarily deciding
when to revoke or Grant ldps it will not
be based in any way on the statute
because the same condition
which is being out of compliance will
trigger both the creation of the ldp and
the revocation of the ldp and it's
mandatory now I'm pretty sure that
Driver Services wants this that DHS
wants this bill and that they want to
show some leniency so that the policy
purpose can be achieved and I'm going to
vote Yes because we want to allow people
this limited driving permit this has got
to be fixed next year and I hope I can
count on my colleagues in the Senate to
change it what we'll hopefully do is put
something in line uh 76-78 that says
that if you are not making a good faith
effort to be in compliance with your
child support obligations then your ldp
can get taken away but right now the
bill is uh
a little bit flawed that's all right we
we do that all the time so there are no
questions Mr President I yield the well
yeah you have one question senator from
33rd you just want to speak on you have
no questions Senator okay thank you Mr
President

examiners and we only have nine filled
so we have 10 openings these are
certainly professional people there in
high demand you're talking about medical
doctors with forensic medicine
background
five states other states have
initiatives to try to recruit these

repayment of student debt program to pay
up to a hundred and twenty thousand
dollars of student debt if a medical
examiner will agree to stay with the
rgbi for five years the loan is paid
back
in a manner that is back loaded so

thank you Mr President uh this is HB 193
we're amending the uh Public Works law
Uh current law uh requires a hundred
thousand uh dollars anything over a
hundred thousand dollars local
governments have to uh request a bid
process we're looking to raise that to
250 000 uh to allow local governments to
be able to get projects done quicker
obviously everybody knows cost of doing
business has gone up everything costs
more today uh so local governments are
having trouble getting some of these
smaller projects done it's good for
small business a lot of small
construction type businesses don't have
the staff to to go out and bid projects
and of course now everything just costs
so much so this uh causes problems for
them we've just changed the amount in
two places uh that's what the bill does
and I'll be glad to take any questions
if there are any there are a few
questions here Senator Senator from the
19th
thank you Mr President Senator do you
yield yes Senator didn't you have your
first bill in this chamber a couple of
days ago I did didn't you only take one
question took two oh
that was very kind of generous of you
taking too double what we thought she
would the senator from the 37 is writing
some stuff down and so we're trying to
delay and give him a little bit of time
to get it done but it looks like he's
getting clearer then my next question
would be
um is your day going okay
oh yeah good deal good deal

questions senator from the 30th
thank you Mr President Senator yield yes
sir so you're raising this two and a
half times that the amount two and a
half times here
all right when did this hundred thousand
go into place uh it went into effect I
believe in 2000 and 2000 23 years ago is
he still riding over there
hmm
okay I got no further questions Senator
thank you
thank you they're also I believe is a
friendly Amendment that's on your desk
uh that I don't have any problems with
if the body so chooses to uh uh work
with the bill there's two of them I
believe sorry
Mr President there are no other
questions
very good bill
GMA AC associated general contractors
and GMA support the bill as well
one more question senator from 21st I
don't have a question I just want to
well sit down man senator now I'm
kidding hi
Mr President I'm gonna yield the whale
yeah
all right senator from the 21st would
you like to oh thank you thank you Mr
President I can stand up now
um I asked for unanimous consent to
withdraw Amendment one
senator from the 21st says uh ask
unanimous consent or withdrawal
Amendment one does anyone object
no objection so Senator one is withdrawn
and now Senator you'd like to speak to
Amendment two
thank you Mr President
um every unit of government in the state
of Georgia except Marta can leverage
competitively bid contracts from other
jurisdictions cities counties state
agencies the MARTA Act only allows Marta
to do federal and state contracts so
Marta is unable to leverage City County
contracts for anything this amendment
would give them flexibility to do so so
for example if they wanted to contract
with the city of alpharetta's contract
on
their Police Department to have their
park and rides have police there to
monitor some of the stuff that's
happening in those parking rides they
could do that or if they wanted to a CID
has a landscaping contract they would be
able to piggyback on that if they do a
Marta Bus rapid transit station and have
landscaping around it so this just
allows them to do what they can do on
the federal state level on the city and
county level
Mr President I will yield the well if
there's no question you have no
questions Senator thank you
does any other Senator wish to rise
to speak for against the measure
chair here is none

the committee of the Senate on insurance
and labor recommends that this building
passed respectfully submitted by Senator
Walker of the 20th district chairman
that completes the ordinance president
recognize the senator from the 20th to
present the bill the chairman of
insurance
present the bill
thank you Mr President uh I was out
yesterday and so I I didn't feel as
prepared to present this today as I
should be but after hearing from the
senator from the 25th I realized that
equality presentation does not stand in
the way of passage of a of a good bill
so I hope you're going to support me on
this uh with a week presentation
uh
back uh decades ago I guess I think it
was during the Riles Administration
the legislature uh
auto insurance companies were having
trouble getting their rate filings
approved in a timely manner and the
legislature
approved what we call a file and use on
personal auto insurance rates
except for the minimum limits carriers
have some carriers don't even offer
minimum limits so they're basically able
to use the the file and use
the insurance commissioner has asked us
to take another look at this we've seen
some skyrocketing auto insurance
premiums from certain certain carriers
and so this bill keeps the minimum limit
requirement the same as it as it has
been but for coverages other than the
minimum limits it basically is a file
and wait to use and it gives the
insurance commissioner's office 60 days
to review the filing
um
and it clarifies that an insurer can
file everything of all their all their
plans at the same time
this compromise will allows the
insurance commissioner to review all
rate filings while
still guaranteeing speed to market for
the industry if there are any questions
I yield the way I'll ask you favorable
consideration thank you
Senator has yielded the well does any
other Senator wish to speak for against
the measure
chair here's none is there objection to
the previous question being ordered
chair here's none of the previous
question is ordered
is their objection to agreeing to the
report of the committee which is
favorable to the passage of the bill
chair hears none the reported committee
has agreed to is there objection to the
main question be in order chair here has
done the main question is ordered
questions on the passage of the bill all
those in favor of the bill will vote yay
opposed nay secretary won't lock the
machine
all the passage of the bill the yeas are
49 and the Nays are won this bill hadn't
received records of constitutional
majorities therefore passed
House Bill 221 and secretary read the
caption
House Bill 222 by representative lumson
of the 12th and others a bill between
title and act women title 33 of the
official code of Georgia annotated
relating to insurance so as to clarify
streamline and make transparent the
practices of the Department of Insurance
to provide that property insurance does
not include service contracts sold or
offered for sale to persons other than
consumers
the committee of the Senate on insurance
and labor recommends that this bill due
pass respectively submitted by Senator
Walker of the 20th district chairman
that completes the order Mr President
recognized as a senator from the 20th
speak to the bill
thank you Mr President uh House Bill 222
is a
bill at the request of the insurance
Commissioners to clean up Bill
essentially section one of the bill
makes it clear that the practice that
that we've had for years where that uh
service contracts sold to Consumers are
regulated by the insurance commissioner
but not service contracts sold to
commercial entities businesses Etc
that'd be like your an extended car
warranty
they've always interpreted the code
section that way it just makes it more
clear section two
if the insurance commissioner gets an
agency agent application and given the
circumstances they want to give a
probationary license to the agent
the the current law they have to issue
two consecutive 12-month
probationary licenses instead of a
two-year probationary license this just
allows them to issue a 24-month
probationary license
Section 3 touches on a similar issue
regarding agency licensing if an agent
applies for a license and is turned down
uh for
criminal history or anything in their
past the only discretion the insurance
commissioner has now is they the
applicant has to wait five years before
they can apply again
uh in the case of a say a DUI or
somewhat uh an offense that has nothing
to do with your fiduciary
responsibilities an insurance agent
there's no flexibility for the
commissioner to waive that five years
this bill would allow him to
based on the circumstances to allow them
to reapply anywhere between one and five
years after refusal and then section
four is simply cleanup of language
and current code that it actually
references a code section that no longer
exists
the it doesn't have anything to do
anything substantive no substantive
change to Public Adjusters or the
current law regarding Public Adjusters
so
any questions uh you do have a question
Senator Senator from 35th
excuse me what a gentleman with eel yes
ma'am senator
does this uh
I asked someone else this question and
they answer but I want to make sure it's
true
a person that has already had a DUI
and the judge said they lose their
license forever
would they be able after five years or
whatever the time limit is to reapply
for a work
uh driving license or temporary
Senator this is dealing with agent
licensing
to being licensed insurance agent it
doesn't have anything to do with the
driver's license
okay so but the example I gave is if you
applied for if you're a new
want to get a new insurance agent
license to be able to legally sell
insurance in Georgia and you apply to
the commissioner for the license and you
have something in your background such
as a DUI that might cause that to be
turned down that application to be
turned down currently they have to wait
five years to reapply this this would
give the commissioner flexibility on
situations similar to that to allow them
to reapply within a year anywhere
between one to five years okay I just
wanted to make sure because I'm with
Mothers Against Drunk Driving and I know
that just like me others have lost their
loved ones lives and they don't want
them to be able to get if the judge has
ruled already that they should lose
their license they shouldn't be able to
get them back yes so that's why I was
asking yes ma'am thank you thank you
you have no questions all right thank
you very much I yell the well
does any other Senator wish to speak for
against a measure

purposes of establishing criminal
violations of said rules and regulations
Committee of the Senate on natural
resources and the environment recommends
that this bill do pass by substitute
respectively submitted by Senator
Anderson of the 24th district chairman
senate committee on natural resources
and environment offers the following
substitute to House Bill 273 a bill to
metallic enactum amend article one of
chapter two of title 12 of the official
code of Georgia annotate relating to
General Provisions relative to the
Department of Natural Resources so as to
extend the date by which rules and
regulation is prescribed by the board of
Natural Resources must be in effect for
purposes of establishing criminal
violations of said rules and regulations
Senator brass of the 28th offers the
following amendment to amend the
substitute to House Bill 273 by
replacing line 27 with the following one
the governor or his or her designee
shall be a Statewide who shall be a
Statewide elected official or state
agency representative serving under the
governor
Senator mallow II and others offer the
following Amendment amendment to them in
the substitute to House Bill 273 and
line two by inserting authorizes
Environmental Protection division to
revoke or to refuse to issue permits as
a result of certain misrepresentation or
non-compliance on behalf of the
applicant to after so as to that
complete the order Mr President
recognize the senator from the third to
speak to the bill
thank you Mr President this is House
Bill 273 it is a DNR it's an agency bill
and it basically does two things to
start with it extends the date by which
rules and regulations prescribed by the
DNR board must be in effect for purposes
of establishing criminal violations of
those rules and regs changes that date
from January 1
2022 to January 1
2023. the second thing it does
is it amends the composition and the
chairmanship of the sapolo island
Heritage Authority
the authority
is established to oversee the um
state-owned Lots on sapolo there are
about 80 or so lots
and this Authority oversees those lots
it does not deal in any doesn't deal
with the operation of the saplo ferry or
anything else
the um
there was some
conversation
between the members of the hog hammock
community
on Sapelo Island and the DNR about more
and better representation of that
community on this Authority
and to that end the DNR has agreed to
and
um
Mr President should I speak to the First
Amendment
I'll go ahead and mention it
you have no questions Sandra this was
discussed in chairman brass pre-filed an
amendment which basically
if you look at the bill
it replaced line 27 with the following
the governor or his or her designee who
shall be a Statewide official or a state
agency representative serving under the
governor
and then this amendment replaces lines
30 through 31 with the following
um
before I tell you that let me tell you
what it's replacing
the way the bill was written before the
amendment
line 30 said two resident descendants of
the community of hog Hammett described
in paragraph five
and this amendment changes that to say
to residents of the community located on
the grounds of the former Spalding
Plantation who are direct descendants of
the slaves of Thomas Spalding a prior
landowner on greater sapolo Island to be
appointed by the governor so in this
instance the um because of the
discussions between the DNR and the
representatives of um and the folks who
live at hog hammock The Hope was that
this apple
Heritage Authority would be
um more functional they'd be able to
meet on a more regular basis and to be
more active in the Affairs of
maintaining the the cultural heritage of
sapolo
and uh Mr chairman I'll yield for
question Mr chairman Mr President are
you have questions you have no questions
okay thank you
senator from the 28th would you like to
speak to you Amendment you wave

to speak come on
and the second time Mr President the
purpose of this amendment is to enhance
the ability of the department to stop
people get caught violating the law and
escaping responsibility through the
creation of a new Sub City area
Corporation all the amendment does is
Grant the epd direct a permissive
authority to take into consideration
misrepresentations or substantial
non-compliance by person or Corporation
if the new organization is substantially
owned by the previous violator it's very
simple uh Amendment Mr President I asked
my colleagues for a favorable
consideration on this amendment thank
