this body previously approved house bill

number of teaching nurses and we did
that by um
setting up a fund to repay up to a
hundred thousand dollars in student loan
debt to any nurse agreeing to teach
rather than practice for a five-year
period
we sent that to the house
in the original bill that that we passed
there was no limitation to where the
nurse taught either in a university
system school or a technical college or
in a private school
the house
amended the bill to take out private
schools sent it back to us we amended
the bill today
to um
allow the private schools to participate

organize senators from the 17th to speak
to the measure
thank you Mr President I wouldn't have
much luck in the house I finally just
agreed to something they did but all
seriousness Senate Bill 133 you all vote
this out 53-1
um
back earlier this year and this is a
bill that deals with juvenile
proceedings and custody being awarded in
different ways in our state from the
bench and without getting to too many of
the Weeds on this you have the
dependency cases with the whole process
set up after a child is awarded to the
state you have Chin's cases and you have
delinquency cases and there's a law
you'll see in section one of the bill
that deals with dual designation where
we have the authority to find a child
dependent and these are two types of
cases the problem is the law doesn't say
what happens next and so what we did
with this bill if you remember when I
presented it which you probably don't
presented the first time there was some
concern we have from juvenile court
judges and and I committed this body to
keep working on the language to make
sure we still had some flexibility for
our judges around the state while having
due process built up and making certain
that whenever it's possible defects is
at the table when a child is handed over
to them so I can tell you a lot of work
went to this we've got a lot of work in
the house side the changes you'll see in
front of you is just taking the current
version and trying to get more
flexibility to The Courts at the same
time and so happy to answer any
questions anybody has but I can tell you
this is a bill that will create due
process rights for families children
parents involved where where custody is
being awarded to the state from the
bench but at the same time it's also
going to make sure we do everything we
can to bring defects to the table in
these cases so we're not just handing
over kids without information that he
fax with the ultimate goal being not
just do process rights being built into
the law but also hope we're getting
getting ahead the hoteling issue we've
seen and we're looking at other
alternatives for kids before they go
into State custody with that Mr
President happy to answer any questions
you have no question Senator ask for
favorable consideration Senate Bill 133

against measure
I will say this will complete our uh
initiative with that uh senator from the
32nd the chair Lady of the children and
family committee and I want to thank the
the chairman of Judiciary senator from
the 17th for helping out we had four big
initiatives out of that new community

Bill and and it's one thing that it does
to protect our consumers here in Georgia
there's two parts of the bill two two
big pieces the first piece is if you
sign up for a subscription online say
Netflix Spotify something along those
lines and you do that on the internet
that you should be able to unsubscribe
from that on the internet they shouldn't
have to make you come in person and do
something to to unsubscribe to a bill
it's a good consumer protection Bill the
second part of it and I want to thank
the those folks that served on the food
delivery service out the uh the study
committee that we did on that that
second part of the bill what it actually
does is it helps to protect the
relationship between the restaurant the
delivery company and the consumer
a lot of rest and the Restaurant
Association has been working for six
years to try to get this passed what
this bill will actually do is is make
sure that there's a written contract
between the restaurant and the delivery
company everybody in here has had food
that's delivered to them sometimes it's
nice and hot when it gets to you
sometimes it's wet and Soggy the uh what
we want to try to make sure is that the
restaurant doesn't go out of business
because they've got a poor delivery
method send it in a poor delivery
company that's representing them for me
it all this does is make sure that
there's a contract between the
restaurant and the food delivery company
that nobody can go in there and pick up
your food from your restaurant and
deliver it wet and Soggy to a customer
and alienate the customer so I'll ask

entitled an act to amend the Title 31 of

authorize the use of certified
medication AIDS and personal
insinuations to provide related matters
to repeal conflicting laws and for the
other purposes
March 20 2023 the committee of the
Senate on human health services
recommended that the bill do pass by
Senator Watson of the first district
that completes the order Mr President
here's your objection to the bill coming
from the table hearing done I recognize
the senator from the 49th
thank you Mr President House Bill 497
allows State Correctional institutions
or private vendors providing medical
service in those institutions to employ
certified medication aides for the
purpose of performing at the technical
aspects of administer administering
certain medications
the bill right now in Section 1 existing
Georgia law allows certified nurse aides
who choose to achieve further
certification as certified medication
aids to provide service in nursing homes
and assisted living facilities
the certified medication Aid status is
achieved upon meeting criteria
established by the Department of
Community Health and is an important
tool for health care providers to meet
the needs of patients and what we all
know is a challenged industry working
hard to keep up with Workforce shortages
House Bill 497 copies all components of
previous Georgia law in terms of
certification education and necessary
supervision and simply allows for
certified nursing aides to work in State
Correctional institutions as you can
imagine the hiring of sufficient health
care workers in any environment is
challenging but doing so in a
correctional environment is even more
this bill allows another tool to serve
patients currently incarcerated in a
state facility I ask for your favorable
consideration

fit individual gets out of a car with a
handicap tag this lets them wave the ad

the tag but does not require them to put
the disabled vet tag on the car any

forward found out that our state was a
little too regulated in the sense that
we couldn't put the logo in the center
of the tag
so this amendment also changes the code
section to whatever your Livery is or
your logo is on a future vanity plate
you not only have the ability to put it
on the left side but you now can put it
in the middle or to the right side so it
is a an amendment for freedom and ideal
to any questions
all right yield the will yeah thank you
you have actually you do have a couple
questions Senator you got a senator from
the 25 25th
State your inquiry
Senator knows what he speaks
I recognize the senator from the 56 you
have a question for the author I do
thank you Mr President Senator yield yes
sir Senator I'm reading both your
Amendment four and five do you realize
an amendment four that you're going to
eliminate the special license plate for
U.S senator Congress Governor lieutenant
governor uh no sir that's not the case I
think that you're talking about I'm
looking at it
um line 13 says a commissioner shall be
located the left Center or the right
portion of the license plate
so I don't I don't think you're looking
at Senator can I ask you for another
question yes sir I think you need to
look at the Senate substitute
um which is LC
393873 you're asking to replace line 13
and line 13 is the beginning of code
section
40-2-16
if you look at amendment five when it
comes to section two said article is
further amended related to the plates of
U.S senators
um so no it doesn't doesn't change that
okay Senator will you further yield yes
sir sen are you aware there's a process
when you want to get a new license plate
developed that you work with the
Department of Revenue and the committee
to begin that process yes sir uh we did
work with that but like I said earlier I
found out that they're a little too
regulated
um so that's what this amendment does is
it it clarifies it's one of those what
we call cleanup bills and it allows the
logo to be in the center or to the right
side Senator isn't it true that I would
be happy to work with you on a real bill
go through the process on this next year
but these are probably out of order
based on where we are right now without
following the process and I think you've
got some unintended consequences here uh
respectfully disagree Senator I think
this is an amendment for freedom and I
hope you'll vote for it as you support
Freedom uh I do in either way I'll yield
the well Mr President Senator has
yielded the well
I recognize the sermon from the 56 to
speak to the measure
thank you Mr President uh license plate
bills are wonderful I want to thank the
senator from the ninth and certainly the
30th the 28th uh and the 21st uh there's
a process we go through for license
plates here uh that begin with committee
working with the Department of Revenue
uh to make sure these are done in an
orderly way uh I think well I very much
respect uh my colleague who is seeking
to amend uh with four and five uh part
of it is amended inaccurately and will
probably cause some unintended
Consequence the rest of the bill and the
second one again did not follow the
process so I think it's important we
vote for the bill and Amendment one two
and three and I will commit to uh my
senator from the mountains that will
work on four and five uh next year but
I'd ask you to vote down amendments four
and five thank you I yield the well
is the senator from the 28th
thank you Mr President uh senator from
the 56 you helped me eliminate gork and
if we need to eliminate uh the license
plate gork uh we will be doing that so
it does not need to go through the
process support is things so he can put
it up in the Northwest Quadrant of his
license plate

company is placed into liquidation and

that will work the second deal that I
have for you
it's similar to a bill we passed last
year where we have anti-rebating statute
on the books for insurance companies so
you can't induce somebody to buy an
insurance policy
last year we passed the bill to allow
Property and Casualty companies to give
their customer a de minimis value a gift

the governor of our great state has come
to see us on day 40 tonight and uh I
just want to thank him for his
leadership thank him for his partnership
and uh and and helping us with so many
different measures that we've been
trying to get done during this
legislative session uh
let's give a warm Senate welcome to the
83rd governor of the great state of
Georgia The Honorable Brian Brian Kemp
[Applause]
Governor Jones
thank you lieutenant governor Jones I
think he was wanting to call me by the
senator of the 46 but I know uh we have
a replacement back there but it's great
to be in my old stomping grounds I want
to thank lieutenant governor for having
me tonight I also just want to thank
president pro Tim Kennedy Majority
Leader Gooch minority leader Butler and
the members of the Senate we are honored
to be with you on this very busy night
you know just three short months ago the
general assembly in the last three short
months the general assembly has tackled
many tough issues and have worked hard
on measures that have come before you
when we began this session we did so as
partners and I was proud to stand by the
lieutenant governor
then speaker Jan Jones and speaker
nominee Burns as we laid out a vision to
help hard work in Georgians fight
through 40-year high inflation with a
second income tax refund a homestead tax
exemption pay raises for our Educators
and state law enforcement and many other
things and I am grateful that together
we have delivered on those promises
on behalf of all Georges I want to thank
you for that but also want to thank you
for your ongoing support in the fight
against human trafficking led by Marty
Kemp and the members of the grace
commission we are grateful
thank you
we are grateful like in years past the
human trafficking Bill received
bipartisan support from members of both
Chambers and I know that Marty is very
grateful for all of those who supported
that measure this year
with your help we've also secured
legislation and funding that will make
our schools even safer something that I
know we are all thankful for following
this week's tragic events
as well as bills that crack down on both
gang Recruitment and the recent trend of
local prosecutors being unwilling to
follow the law and protect our
communities
I'd like to thank the members of the
senate for their support of the amended
fiscal year 2023 budget which funds
critical priorities in our state
for much of this session the partnership
and thoughtful coordination between the
Senate the house and my office has
benefited the great people of our state
that cooperation and teamwork is what
the voters wanted when they
overwhelmingly supported us at The
Ballot Box last November
as you remember that I mentioned in my
inaugural address the people of the
state gave us all their marching orders
but our work this legislative session as
you all know is not done
first and foremost while both Chambers
have passed the fiscal year budget or
soon will I think it's important for me
to say tonight that the recent news from
the Federal Reserve and others suggest
there may be storm clouds on our
nation's economic Horizon
additionally there are significant holes
in this year's final budget that my
office will need to work closely with
you all the house and the office of plan
and budget to address in the coming
months
as we have done in years past our job is
to make the tough decisions necessary to
keep the financial help help of this
state on sound footing and I believe
that there remains work to be done after
the session to conclude and Achieve that
goal
secondly I would like to ask for your
favorable consideration of house bill
408. legislation focused on projects of
regional significance
simply put this is the most effective
tool Georgia has to remain the top state
for business as we compete with other
states for major Economic Development
projects
the voters of our state spoke clearly
just a few short months ago
they all wanted us to keep working to be
bringing good paying jobs to their
communities both urban and rural
I look forward to working with you all
the rest of the night to pass House Bill
408 to ensure that we do not have to
return to the gold Dome before the
current law of sunsets on July 1st
in closing I want to reiterate something
each of you have probably heard me say
before
our record of success is a state is
thanks to the teamwork that has happened
in this building for many years
we've been through a lot together as you
all know we've had to make tough
decisions and even tougher times
we've LED this state through
unprecedented challenges to brighter and
more prosperous days
but I firmly believe that Georgia's
success in the future will lean on our
ability to continue to work as a team
I hope you all know here
that I am committed to that work and I
look forward to all that we will
accomplish by doing that together on
behalf of the state in the years to come
we know that in this building there's
always been disagreements to overcome
and there will know about doubt be
contentious issues that we have to work
through again but that is why we're here
to lead to work together and to leave
this place better than we found it and
with you all support and continued hard
work tonight and in the years to come
that is exactly what we will do good
luck the rest of the way God bless you
and God bless the state of Georgia Thank
you for having me
let's give the uh the first family uh
Marty and the girls back there in the
bank let's give them a big round of
applause too
and we and we do greatly appreciate the
governor making time to stop by and
visit with us this evening and uh we

appreciate them and appreciate their
partnership

Cold Case murder files by law
enforcement agencies that completes the
order Miss present
recognize the senator from the 29th
speak to the motion
friends and colleagues I'm here to speak
on a bill
that
that had one of the toughest paths to
follow that a bill has to follow inside
of this building
this bill passed through the judicial
committees on the house side
and pass through the scrutinization of
the Judiciary
Committee in the Georgia State Senate
this is the bill the Coleman Baker Act
this bill is very straightforward
and this bill is very necessary
and if you don't appreciate the
necessity of this legislation
then do me a favor and think about
somebody that means the world to you
whether it be a child
whether it be your mother your father
whether it be a spouse or a sibling
that person's here for one minute
and the next minute they're gone
and you don't know why
and you don't know who's responsible for
taking them
and that is the life of an individual
who has to live with a relative a loved
one who is the victim of a violent crime
that takes their life
and nobody knows who is responsible
there are individuals in this room who
experience that they wake up each and
every day
with a hole in their heart
not understanding why it's there not
understanding who's to blame not
understanding what Justice is and what
the Coleman Baker Act does is it
establishes a structure
for those victim families
to reach out to the law enforcement
agencies
that are responsible for investigating
those homicides those murders
and asking them
after three years of no resolution
to please
look into that case look for new
evidence
look for look for things that may have
been missed
ask those law enforcement agencies to
put fresh eyes on those cases
and those law enforcement agencies have
the opportunity
to look at the case and see if there are
opportunities
to discover new evidence and maybe
Define new suspects and if not the law
enforcement agency lets the family know
after an investigation after an overview
of the evidence from the initial
investigation as to whether there is a
path forward
there's nothing in here that forces the
law enforcement agency to open up a new
investigation if they do not see a path
forward
and what I'm asking you to do
is to vote on a
a piece of legislation that allows law
enforcement agencies to review the cases
allows law enforcement agencies to
communicate with the victims families
and allows the Carl Vinson Institute at
the University of Georgia to track cold
cases throughout the state of Georgia
and while you are in this chamber
those of you who are listening this
legislation I appreciate
and those of you who are not
I may not necessarily
but the one person that I do appreciate
that's here
is Chandler Baker who's sitting up in
the gallery
because she wants to know what happened
to her sister-in-law
she wants to bring Justice not only to
her husband
but to her in-laws
so that they will know
and they will never know why
they'll never understand completely why
someone would do something like that but
at least they will move a little closer
to resolution
in this legislation gives them that
opportunity Mr President I'll yield for
any questions
you have no questions Senator thank you
Mr President I yield the well
Senator has yielded does any other
Senator wish to speak for against the
measure
chair here is done here's your objection
to the previous question being ordered

insurance so as to revised certain
procedures timelines and other matters
concerning consumer protections against
surprise billing to provide grounds for
new violations of unfair claim
settlement practices to provide for
payments by insurers to provide for
commissioner authority to provide for
penalties
the committee of the Senate on insurance
and labor recommends that this bill due
pass respectively submitted by Senator
Walker of the 20th district chairman
yeah senator hofstetler of the 52nd
offers the following Amendment Amendment
one to amend House Bill 295 by deleting
or facility on lines 36 37 39 44 45 and
62. that completes the order is present
without objection I recognize senator
from the 52nd thank you Mr President we
passed surprise billing several years
ago since then the federal government
actually passed their own that we were
waiting on for many years and the other
thing that happens is the erisa plans
the Supreme Court in 2017 said that the
state could not regulate those so some
of them are riska plan some of them are
State plans
since then we've had a problem where
maybe they weren't all identified which
was it I think Blue Cross has actually
done a really fine job of identifying
those forests not everybody has has
gotten that right so this is they have
to identify it the second thing is that
the insurance commissioner has asked
that we changed some of those from 15
days to 30 days and some of those from
30 days to 60 days to help them out and
we've agreed to that
and then the third thing that's in there
is a penalty we've had one Hospital
group
you can probably guess which one it is
that has clogged the system up with
with uh
asking for Corrections on surprise bills
without providing any data any follow-up
and so this was done in the fall before
all this happened but
the bill now says that that if you do
that the insurance commissioner can give
you two thousand dollar fine
and if you do it knowingly they can give
a five thousand dollar fine so that
people aren't
ascending frivolous claims in it again
there's only one Hospital group that's
been doing that those are three changes
I also on the amendment in the agreement
was that we would take or facility out
in those lines that's been agreed to by
the house and they will agree to it when
it goes back over
there's no questions I'll yield the well

all right we're going to have to go
ahead to we're going to quiet it down a
little bit ladies and gentlemen you're
going to have to quiet it down those
unauthorized Personnel we're going to
have to ask you to either Exit the
chambers or try to be respectful what's
going on here
thank you Mr President
colleagues before you you have the
Senate Bill House Bill and everything is
confused but the reality of it is just
look for 196 house bill 196. let me tell
you about this bill so you know what
you'll be voting on and make sure we get
it right
House Bill 196 is two bills in one house
bill is the medical cannabis bill and
house bill on page 40 is the hemp bill
that we tried to get past of this
chamber that we just got some confusion
on let me tell you what's going on so
you'll know
the house bill 196 addresses the medical
cannabis issue in this state to approach
and move the medical cannabis beyond the
broken promises that we've been giving
people
is a vehicle to settle to pending legal
actions and fulfill it as soon as
practical and deliver the medicine to
the citizens of Georgia which is
curtailed the suffering on a daily basis
let me tell you what this bill does as
we follow through it I'm going to hit
the high point so we'll know where we're
talking about
it abolishes the Cannabis commission and
transfers the function to the
agriculture department where the
responsibility of an elected official
who is accountable to the people of this
state can administer this program and
open and transparent manner let me say
this right now we have no control over
the Cannabis commission we give them a
million plus dollars and they answer to
no one
I want to put this we want to put this
to the agriculture Department the
commission of Agriculture who is elected
by the state of people who we know will
be transparent number two
the division of the agriculture
department will be subject to the
administrators the procedures act and
open records acts no more secrecy when
it comes to business no more secrecy an
unelected bureaucracy
number three appeals from the decision
of this Administration agency will be
made to the Georgia Statewide business
court that means it moves fast and gets
done
a license will be available to have
additional transparency at the
production facility that means a
licensee can have a license to sell the
stuff at the place where they make the
darn stuff
a dispensary can sell it and any other
licensed facilities product at its
dispensary this will help the retail
Network for our patients and our
constituents a joint and robust
oversight committee is established
involving many members of various House
and Senate committees
the agriculture commissioner will
mediate with nine companies that have
protested and are currently litigating
which has been held up for about four
and a half in the center Senator Senator
John Paul's ladies and gentlemen ladies
and gentlemen
I need your attention we have a senator
in the well right now and he is
addressing a pretty serious matter I
need your attention all authorized
Personnel we need you to exit the
chamber hate to be like this but I've
asked you multiple times now
senator
floor is yours
I'll start back on my seventh
seventh uh note the agriculture will
mediate with nine with the nine
companies that have protested and are
currently litigating with the with the
Georgia medical cannabis commission the
commissioner would be authorized but not
obligated and repeat that not obligated
to addition additional to issue
additional licenses as a resolution to
this mediation if that occurs
litigations will be dropped
this has been going on four and a half
years folks I didn't even get here when
this started happening
the commit number eight the commission
will also have the discretion but not
the obligation to it to issue additional
licenses as organic growth in the
registry occurs the maximum number of
license that a commissioner could issue
would be maxed out at 20 which I promise
you we won't get there but he got a Max
of 20. which will be compared to other
states is far lower than any other
states with licensed numbers but again
the commissioner is not required to give
one more license not one more license
number nine the vesting of the of the
discretion of the agriculture
commissioner will allow him and his team
and experts to ensure a healthy and fair
market which brings this much needed
medication to all the Georgia Citizens
and keeps it affordable it ensures that
Georgia's small business now hear me now
including minority-owned businesses are
not left out in the cold and they're not
forced to close their doors with all the
stringent rules and regulations and let
me tell you something folks the hemp
bill goes on and says you got to be 21
years and older to buy this stuff now
right now any number whether you're 8 10
12 14 or 15 you can walk in and buy it
we're going to put it on there where you
do not have you have to be 21 years or
older to buy this material hear me on
this
we need controls of this industry
we need controls this gives us the
controls that we need it outlines all
the the the medications in here it
outlies all the things that we can treat
in here and what it can be transferred
to this bill is a solid bill that came
over from the house and I think it only
only fell by like 13 votes over there
it's a solid bill that moves this state
forward folks we have been promising
folks medical cannabis since I don't
know how long
it is time for us to get off the pot and
deliver and it's time for us to have a
commissioned a an agriculture Mission
take it away from a commission that
doesn't answer to us we're putting the
money in and we have absolutely no say
so in this business
we need to make a change and I will tell
you this last condition is is you know
we have got to make sure that when we do
these things here we do these things the
correct way other states have done this
they are succeeding in their message and
they're getting their medication to
people there is no reason Georgia can't
be as effective I ask you to please
vote for this bill pass this bill move
this forward if we need to tweak this
bill I will gladly be the one sitting up
here and tell you we need to tweak this
bill gladly and I will do whatever it
takes to make sure we get it right but
let me tell you one more thing this
would have been handled a while back but
our previous agriculture commissioner
wanted nothing to do with it and we had
absolutely nowhere to go with it that's
where the Cannabis commission came in
now we have an agriculture bear who's
one of our own
who's willing to take this on put the
people in place fix it make it happen
and deliver on a promise
ladies and gentlemen I'll live with it
well I'll ask no question I know we're
tired I know it's long night I know the
bills long can't have time to go through
it but I'm asking you to vote green to
pass this bill Mr President no question
I yield well you do have some questions
Senator yes sir recognize senator from
the 45th
Mr President I was just wanting to
excuse the senator from the 48 that the
appropriate
that sounded good to me Paul
all right well no objection I think he'd
be excused uh recognize senator from the
29th
Senator Yale
yes sir
Senator did I hear you say that this
bill expands the opportunity for more
licenses in Georgia yes sir I said it it
gives the agriculture commissioner there
ability to expand it up to 20 licenses
but he does not have to issue one more
license if our registry does not grow
so Senator why would we not wait to see
if our registry grow grows any before we
would expand this I'll assure you he
will wait and do it but I will say this
to you Senator we only have like 25 to
27 000 people on the restroom right now
because we have been promising people
for four or five years to let them get
this medication the moment this is
available I'll assure you that registry
is going to jump up probably into
hundreds of thousands if not close to a
million or more is it not true the
senator continue Senators is it not true
that once we make anything available
that people are going to line up to get
it because I do believe Senator and
correct me if I'm wrong that when we
first passed this legislation we had a
limited number of conditions that this
product could be used for and there have
been many attempts to expand those
conditions uh is that not true Senator I
was not here when y'all first passed
this four and a half years ago I can't
speak to that
Senator the senator yield for one last
question yes sir Senator do you know how
many Georgians could be treated by 20
licensees well as you well know we've
said at many committee meetings you
we've heard various numbers on that I'll
assure you this right here from what I
know about the industry it will take
more than the four or five licenses that
we have available in Georgia under the
current law that we passed to treat
what's going on because these folks Mr
senator they are not ready to produce
medical marijuana because of what it
takes to get it to the point from start
to finish to fruition and right now we
need other people in this and and we
don't need to have to let maybe just
four or five people monopolize this four
or five companies and most of those
companies except one that I know of are
from Canada and from out of state this
is Georgia grown stuff I'm trying to
work with
thank you Senator thank you
Mr President request
you have one one last question uh
senators from the 19th
thank you Mr President Senator my good
friend to you yield appropriation
chairman absolutely Senator you know I
had a lot of respect for you and I
appreciate what you're trying to do for
South Georgia but how many new licenses
could there be so I'm sorry how many new
licenses could this bill allow it will
allow up to 20 total not new license but
up 220. but let me repeat again the
Agriculture Commission not has to issue
a license not a new license I thought I
heard you say that well the senator
further you go so the agricultural
commissioner would have sole discretion
as to whether or not to issue a new
license his board with Senators on the
board with Representatives on the board
and members on the board
that's how the agriculture is going to
set it up
senator I I guess I won't speak to it I
say the reason that I can't support your
bill your as agree as amended is because
I think putting that much power with one
person is just
you would only do that if you don't
really care about them because the even
the power that we've had levied on us
about gambling in here marijuana and
cannabis is going to be 10 times that
and that power I just
I am too good of friends and respect the
agriculture commissioner enough to put
that type of power in such a small few
hands I I can't do that to him Mr
chairman I will respond to that by
telling you this right now we have the
power of resting in a cannabis
commission that we have absolutely no
control over we don't know they don't
answer to us they don't return calls
they don't do anything and you're as an
appropriate Champion are appropriate
money to a cannabis commission that we
have absolutely no say-so in I think
that's ludicrous
Senator you have a few more questions
that you're welcome to yield the well
let's vote on Mr go ahead
whatever I'll take another one
all right senator from the 39th
Senator do you yield
yes ma'am
so it seems to me that we keep coming
back to this question of
the competitive bids from way back when
we now have two licenses that have been
issued to production correct
and I see in here in lines 738 through
741 going back to the fact that the AG
commissioner if this bill passes would
have sole discretion to not just
provide new licenses but actually engage
in mediation with the applicants that
participated in the original competitive
applications process
in a normal competitive bidding process
is it not true that you win or you lose
you can sue and then whatever happens
with that which lawsuits are in process
right now then you either win it or you
don't but you don't then get to come to
the front of the line ahead of everybody
else when you lost a process
Center knows of what she speaks and I
will I will expand on that by the way
under this license the way this bill is
written if we negotiate with the ones
that had that that protested then that
could be settled and we could get on
when making a product that needs to be
done thank you senator
Senator you you have another question
but you're welcome to yield the well
anytime Senator I'll take one more
I'm trying you you got two hours until
it's midnight so yeah
probably why senator
thank you Senators please vote for this
bill we've got to move this forward Mo
green thank you I recognize the senator
from the 46 to speak
thank you Mr President
Senators my motion was going to be to
disagree so that we could go to
conference and see what's in this bill
and see if we could resolve our
differences in it I believe I heard the
senator from the 13th just say this is
53 pages I don't know what all is in it
and then went on to say the parts that
he did know
we are known as a deliberative body
this is making a mockery of
deliberations
you will remember back
before crossover day
parts of this bill were on our floor
the hemp Bill and it was such a disaster
it ended up being reconsidered being
tabled never got out of this chamber
I haven't been able this has been on our
desk literally maybe two minutes before
it was called up
three minutes I hadn't had a chance to
even read it I can tell looking at it
that it adds a whole nother bill
on hemp regulation
it also vastly changes the bill that we
just passed out of here a couple of days
ago we asked the Department of
Agriculture to review
the rules the regulations the licensing
the usage of medical marijuana
to see what was the best past path going
forward
we don't even know if the Department of
Agriculture wants this responsibility
yet
we are now destroying we are abolishing
a commission that we established that
worked for four years and finally issued
the licenses two of them who are now up
and running and claim they will have the
product on the shelves by June
and have tentatively issued the other
four licenses that are being litigated
and we anticipate that litigation will
finish up about the time the Department
of Agriculture tells us the best way
forward whether he even wants to license
this
engage in it test all these products do
the different things that might be asked
it seems so unfair to us to just
unilaterally now go abolish a commission
without any hearings on that to ever let
one member of the commission come
testify where they are what they've done
what they think
this does exactly what the senator from
the 39th said it stops IT circumvents
the judicial process throws all these
nine cases out of court and says y'all
are going to mediation now
with the Department of Agriculture
what experience in any other area
does the Department of Agriculture have
in mediations
or rendering decisions they never got to
even consider any of the applications
that these 69 companies submitted
and what about the others 63 of them
that didn't litigate
that they get to come back to the table
and and be mediated themselves no
they are out we punish those people that
didn't sue
and we reward the ones that sued but we
don't trust our own court system
that is hearing those cases right now we
say that our Department of Agriculture
is more suited to resolve people's
disputes
than our court system
what are we doing
I I don't
understand where these ideas came from
but I can tell you this they never came
through our committee process
none of this bill other than a few
aspects of what I'm hearing now I hadn't
had a chance to read on the hemp came
through our committee we didn't
contemplate
destroying a commission that we
ourselves created just a few years ago
and totally replacing them with a
department that we hadn't heard from to
see if they want to do this regulation
yes Mr
I didn't ask you okay
as far as the 20 licenses
Let me refresh you
when we passed this bill out
a few days ago
we made a point I let you know that the
folks that testified in our committee
and the regulated Industries committee
the two type one licensees and several
of the type 2 licensees were there
and they all agreed that just the two
type one alone can produce enough low
THC oil to treat 600
000 patients and it's going to be on the
shelves this June the other four class
two licensees could probably handle the
same amount
so we have we don't need 20 licenses
six can produce enough for 1.2 million
some say as many as 2 million patients
and you know how many we have
twenty six thousand
we already have enough production for 20
times the patients that are listed
that have signed up on the registry so
why are we doing this
why do we think that we as a legislative
body are smarter than the court system
or smarter than the commission that we
appointed
our own governor and lieutenant governor
and speaker appointed these people to
the commission to make these decisions
it is crazy and so all this motion is
really doing
is either trying to pass out a bill that
more than likely ought to be vetoed for
being so ill-considered makes us look
like a bunch of clowns in here for
passing something out without any
deliberation on it at all
and
just sticks it to the court system
saying we don't trust our own court
system
to come up with a reasonable resolution
to these disputes over the licenses
I urge you
to vote no on this motion to agree and
if we're going to do something of this
significance let's do it right
I'm happy to take any questions Mr
President or I'll yield the well you do
have one question senator from the
second thank you Mr Senator Yale I do
you Senator I heard your uh oral
arguments here about trusting our
Judicial System uh Senator would you
um agree that this body in fact does not
trust our judicial system and that's why
we have passed so many mandatory
minimums to tie the hands of those
judges making those decisions and in
fact that means we do not trust those
judges
Touche on that that we want to make
certain that they see the significance
of the crimes the way we do and that's
why we give the boundaries the minimums
and the maximums for the penalty and
leave them to decide they're in between
Senator you have no further questions
thank you I yield the will
senator from 31st what purpose you rise
Mr Mr President appropriate time I'd
like to make a motion
you'd like to make a motion like to make
a motion to table HB 196.
the motion is in order is there
objection
all those in favor of the motion will
vote yay all oppose no secretary unlock
the machine
on the motion to table the A's are 22
and the Nays are 30 and the motion has
failed
so we will continue to debate I
recognize senator from the 37th
famous president ladies and gentlemen
Senate the hours late but I do want to
remind us of something and caution this
body on the proposition before us
as the center from the 46 so clearly
said we've got to Bill of 54 pages over
1300 lines that's not been the through
the committee process and this
deliberative chamber but what we have
heard what we haven't heard in the
debate tonight is the discussion of
concentrating in the agricultural
commission or the power to take from six
or so licenses and expand up to 20
licenses
now when you think about this
you think about our state of Georgia you
know we recognize agriculture is the
number one industry in our state you
know we lead in in peanuts and
blueberries or big and cotton we can go
through all the the poultry industry
here the the importance of our
agriculture commissioner is really
um
hard to really capture
um in the state of Georgia
what I'm concerned about here is what
the gentleman from the the senator from
the 19th alluded to in his question is
what we're doing
by concentrating power in the
agriculture Commissioners this proposal
would suggest that we do is we would
take an agricultural commissioner role
which is an important Statewide position
and we would create incentives
for the marijuana industry to put their
person in that job
now the former senator from the seventh
is our current agriculture commissioner
serving this body
um served very credibly as it has an
expertise as we well know in the in what
we recognize as traditional agriculture
many of you here that that's your your
main livelihood
but if we invest this power in the
agriculture commissioner we're not no
longer going to have an agriculture
commissioner
the money that's going to rush into the
Statewide race of agriculture
commissioner to win the prize
to win this prize of taking this seat
will take the seat which is now the
agriculture commissioner and turn it
into what will effectively be the
marijuana commissioner
I don't think we want the millions of
dollars that would rush into Statewide
elections around this commissioner to be
driven by marijuana interests
instead of Agriculture interests
agriculture is the industry that our
state was founded on it's what bring us
to the dance
and I think it's way way way too
important to our state
to create incentives that the marijuana
candidates could wash aside all the
folks who really know AG think about our
previous
two agriculture Commissioners and how
they contributed and are contributing
such a powerful way I think this
proposal which is put before us tonight
at this very late hour is not only Hasty
but dangerous
and I'd ask members to vote no on this
uh this this version of
House Bill 196. be glad to take a
question Mr Mr President
you do have a question Senator
um senator from the second
does the senator Yale yes sir Senator uh
since we've been in session we've had
Litany of bills that have been offered
to Amendments of other bills and asked
the chair for a ruling on their
germanness of that bill so is it not
true that it is in fact a practice of
this body to move massive amounts of
legislation at such a late hours is that
not true well I would tell you is it
delivered a body I think we should all
be cautioned to the extent that happens
and I think when we've got something
like this that the the dollars that are
in Play are as big as they are
um that something is important as our
agriculture industry and the leader of
our industry is in is uh is gonna be
subject to millions of dollars of
out-of-state marijuana investment to win
the prize
of what would effectively become a
marijuana commissioner I think this body
would be wise to reject this proposal
and with that Mr President I yield the
will
Senators you will recognize senator from
the 19th
hello
members uh thank you for letting me
speak on this on Hospital 9196.
I try to only come to the well when I
think it's important an issue like the
budget or an issue I think is going to
affect something constitutionally
this is one of those issues
what this bill allows is 20 additional
licenses
and I heard my friend from the 13th say
no it's only if he gives them
really
what do you think the pressure is going
to be
on that individual which if you look
it's only been on your desk for 30
minutes but if you take a look and read
it really carefully and you decide you
want to flip yourself to about page 16.
I didn't get to write down the page
numbers because it hadn't been there
long enough
you'll see that it's based with one
person not a board
one person
it's a bill we've debated for years and
I've heard the argument now that this
gets it out to people
well we've already got two licenses
getting it out to people
that process is working and I'll tell
you I'm the first to tell you that I've
had issues with a cannabis Commission
our body has struck their budget
we have worked to try to make that
better and we now have two licenses
working
so why should you take this bill as
seriously as you take other measures
when we speak here
let's use two scenarios one do you not
like the agricultural commissioner
do you not like it if you don't like the
agricultural commissioner you should
vote no to this bill because this gives
him extreme power
he can pick the licensees
he decides if they're going to get a
license
if you don't like him
you shouldn't vote for this bill
the second group of people who should
vote against this bill
are the people who like
the agriculture commissioner and here's
why
you're about to give him incredible
pressure
you felt the pressure that this
building's had on things like gambling
and casinos and horse racing
and you felt those pressures on you
and you've had to make your decision
if you do not think the money in this
industry is 10 times that weight
you've never been in this building
and we got to disperse that weight and
that pressure over 56 of us
you're about to put that weight in that
pressure on one person
that's not fair to them
so what I ask if you're in the category
that doesn't like the commissioner you
vote no
and if you're in the category that likes
the commissioner
you should vote no too
thank you Mr President I yield the will
recognize senator from the 16th
thank you Mr President
I look at a bill like this I wonder how
we go back to our constituents and so we
had it on our desk a major major build
we had less than 30 minutes to even look
at that's not gone through the committee
process how can we say that to our
people that trust us to make wise
decisions and to rush into something
like this
what the senator from the 19th said we
take it from a commission to one person
that is not responsible I believe we
need to say no to this right now we need
to hold with it and take the time to do
it properly and not rush through
something of this magnitude that has
implications to our children to our
families and if you've got two units
that can already do six hundred thousand
that's a million two in my math I think
we need to walk through and walk
carefully through this bill and not vote
on it tonight and say no to it and and
work through it that's my portion thank
you sir
Senators yield of the well recognize the
senator from the 47th
thank you Mr President
you know one of the things that for me I
want to let everybody in here know
I'm adamantly opposed to the use of
recreational marijuana
I think it would be a terrible thing
because it would open up the courts for
all kind of litigation and stop our
business in our community
at the same token
I've been pushing for for years to try
to get the medicinal use of marijuana or
some byproduct of it for years
and and I know that we've got a lot of
new people that have changed faces in
here since the the a little over four
years ago
but some of y'all that are in the
Republican caucus I know for sure and
probably some of y'all in the Democrat
College because I'm willing to bet he
went to both caucuses he said but
Governor deal came to us on the last day
that we were in legislature in in
session the uh his last year that he was
governor I believe that would have been
like 2019 or something
and he talked about his business partner
and friend that's wife had terrible
seizures had seizures for for years and
years and years they had means they went
to all kind of medical facilities they
checked everything they could do
eventually since somebody told him they
said hey why don't you go try this in
Colorado and and and took the the oil
from Cannabis and and came back in and
never had any migraines from that point
forward and for me the uh I'm not a
doctor I'm I'm I was terrible in biology
and chemistry
but we passed the legislation that day
to to help put this oil out there for
people
we created a commission we created a
bureaucracy unfortunately and it seems
to be that way
and I will tell you I said the I'm not a
lawyer but there's a lot of lawyers
involved in this
our AG commissioner my fraternity
brother my former Suite mate supports
this said the uh going to him he can
withstand the pressure of whatever it
takes for me I'm going to ask each of
y'all to help give some relief to those
people that need relief we know it's
it's a situation where we can't import
it from another state but it's something
that we need to be able to provide to
those people that need it medically here
in Georgia and I want to try to help
them get that relief and get that done
so I'll ask you to vote in favor of this
bill whatever it takes for us to get
production the bureaucracies that we've
been dealing with are holding back the
uh those people that need help so I'll
ask you to vote green on this Bill thank
you
Senators yield and recognize the Senate
from 30th
thank you Mr President I'll be quick
because how seriously can you take
somebody wearing a seersucker suit and a
pink bow tie
hey like six times medical marijuana has
come for this body since I've been here
six times I have voted in favor of
because I look at the the challenges
we've had with the kids with with adults
with debilitating diseases and I have
said let's do everything we can to help
support those
this will not be the seventh time
I will vote no on this bill
the at the commission that set up the
the Cannabis commission they were
terrible
they were probably one of the most
disorganized entities that we've ever
had
but what we don't want to do is compound
the problem by rushing through
a bad piece of legislation right here
we and I understand for those of you
saying let's get the product out
remember we are getting the product out
there is product coming out on this
we are going to be able to get to those
kids and that's honestly that has been
my main focus area
the medicines they need to help treat
their symptoms
without making a further mess
on these other licenses
if it's that important
and we can treat those easily with the
amount that we're putting out
right now
let's be patient and look at the best
way to move this thing going forward I
do think the Cannabis commission needs
to be absolved
but we ought to be real careful in how
we're doing this so that's why I'm going
to vote no on this bill
as soon as yielded the well senator from
the 28th
thank you Mr President
there haven't been a bigger advocate in
this chamber over the last six years for
medical marijuana
and I stand before you
and I'll be honest I'm I was torn on
whether I wanted to come down here
because we're
this is a process we all know this is a
process and it's a tough process
and the laws that we put forward
five years ago to form this Commission
we had no idea it would take this long
had no idea
we were hoping we'd have it out and
within a year and a half two years and
it didn't happen
and when the commission finally got
their act together
and they finally put out their notice of
intent
to make the awards for these licenses
and yes it was a flawed process it was a
very flawed process and and part of it
was our fault because we had a flawed
law we put forward a flawed law that put
forward a flawed process
and here we are again we're not going to
do it once but we're going to do it
twice
there are two flawed bills combined
together that we're being asked to vote
on
we heard we heard testimony let's talk
specifically on the hemp piece
there are there are small businesses out
there that we are about to put out of
business if we pass this
and when we talk about the medical
marijuana side and we talk about why
medicine is not on shelves
well guess what it would have been a
year it would have been in there a year
ago we would have medicine on the
shelves
if these court cases were done
but they're not they're being dragged
out they're in appeals and that is why
we don't have medicine on the shelves
there's no other reason
and it again it pains me to come down
here and talk about this because I have
friends that have applied
and I want them to get it I wanted them
to get it then but they didn't
and now they've asked for their day in
court
they have asked for a judge to make a
decision
and we're taking that away
and not only that now we're about to add
we're about to give standing to the next
group of folks the next group of people
that filed
that applied for this we're about to
give them standing
so that they can sue so are we going to
come back next year and add 20 more
because if you watch what happened in
Florida that's pretty much what happened
look we spent a lot of time on a study
committee to put forward a law and a lot
of that stuff was was entailed it was it
was put into what we passed out of this
chamber and what we passed out of out of
this capital
a lot of that was put in a lot of it was
left out some of that through the Senate
process and through a committee sub when
the Senate did have input
some of that was put back in
recommendations that we had made six
years ago from that study committee
and now they're all taken out
the senate had zero input on this
again going back to that study committee
I insisted six years ago that it be and
no pun intended but it be a joint study
committee of both Chambers House and
Senate so that we could both have input
we were about to go to conference on
this bill
so that both Chambers could have input
but now we've lost that and now we have
to vote on this
again we put a flawed law out there
five years ago
and we've we've seen the the issues that
it has caused and now we're about to do
it two more times with one vote
it's bad policy y'all
Senators yielded well
I recognize the majority leader uh Mr
chairman not Mr President I move the
question
Senators move called question
here's their objection
without objection the question the
question the question is ordered
the question is on this from the senator

on his Amendment to the Senate Subs to
on House Bill 196. all those in favor of
his sub will vote yay all those opposed
I recognize senator
to what purpose do you rise
parliamentary inquiry station inquiry
isn't it true that if we vote down this
motion and vote my motion
to disagree we send it back to the house
and give them a chance to receive or
else to insist and us have a quick
conference committee and do some
sensible legislation here either of
those two options wins voting yes for
this loses
that is correct in the fact that we take
up your emotion after we address the
centers from the 13th motion
Center is correct
back to the original motion
center from 53rd for what purpose do you
rise parliamentary inquiry State your
inquiry if we do go to a conference
committee considering the late hour and
to my understanding it has to be in our
desk for two hours will we have time for
a college committee unless you can
suspend the rules
but if you don't suspend the rules yes
it says for two hours okay here we go
all those in favor of the centers 13th
uh Amendment we'll vote yay all those
opposed day secretary unlock the machine
recognize the center for under 46. isn't
it true that a red vote here gives these
children a chance to get the medicine by
June
sinner is passionate about what he
speaks
on the motion to
only agree to the house Amendment to the
Senate substitute the yeas are 28 and
the Nays are 26 and this motion has
failed
senator from the 13th what purpose do
you rise Mr President asked for recount
please
reconsideration social recap
Center recount
all right
the senator has moved for
reconsideration
senator for the second what purpose do
you rise uh parliamentary Mr President
States your inquiry Mr President uh do
we not have to vote on the underlying
motion before a motion to reconsider
says there's another motion of
subsequent motion on the table
we we just did Senator
no so he's reconsidering his vote on
there
so so the
those or who the the motion is of a
reconsideration those who are in favor
of reconsideration would vote yay
opposed nay secretary unlock the machine
senator from the 20th what purpose do
you rise
in a true Mr President that we're
killing a lot of potential other bills
with this long drug out thing on the uh
if the idea was to kill time of doing a
good job of it senator
on the motion to reconsideration the
azar27 the Nays are 28 and the motion
has failed
now it goes to the center from the 46
his motion
his his motion is to disagree to the
house position
but he is given time to speak in the
well on it on this issue
thank you Mr President I'll be quick
since we've debated this pretty
thoroughly I think most people have been
heard
please vote with me to disagree to the
house position
and let's send it back to them
and see if they will either recede and
accept this bill so we can make progress
on medical marijuana or if they will
disagree so that we can try to have a
quick conference committee see if
there's any common ground and waive the
rule if need be so that we can get
something done this time I think that's
the way to go that's a totally new bill
that we weren't familiar with at all it
has a lot of new Concepts a lot of
things we don't understand perhaps they
can explain them in a conference so
please join with me to disagree to the
house amendment to our bill
house bill 196. I yield the well
let's try to work on some other bills
Sinners yielded well
does any other Senator we speak for
against the measure

order Mis president
Senator his move is it without objection
I'll recognize the senator from the 45th
to speak to the bill
before before you get started though I
want to recognize the former mayor of
Augusta Georgia and former state senator
our good friend Hardy Davis is up here
today so
he was always so good to me when he was
here in the state senate I just knew
he'd get me on the Augusta Nationals and
became mayor so
didn't happen though that's all right I
still love him so glad to have you here
senator
recognize senator from the 45th
thank you Mr President
I bring
hb353 before you today I'm the Senate
sponsor of this bill I'm also the Senate
sponsor of amendment number four uh the
original bill it did it had eight things
that it did it allowed for a gift card
for Redemption it increased the prize of
Class A gains which is your crate your
crane games or your games you see to
Chuck E cheese from five dollars to
fifty dollars uh it also it also offered
uh regulated Industries and protections
under the administrative procedures act
and a few other things is what it did
putting guard rails on the industry
adding more transparency to the industry
but after a long debate and going back
and forth within this chamber and with a
house
my amendment number four it deletes
lines 34 through lines 294 and
essentially only leaves the APA portion
in the bill
and essentially so what it would do with
if we adopt uh amendment number four it
would only leave the administrative
procedures act in the bill the
administrative procedures act for the
co-am division under the Georgia Lottery
Corporation
this will make the process regarding
rules and regulations more transparent
giving stakeholders the right to give
input the Georgia Lottery would have to
comply with the administrative
procedures Act only when acting as a
regulator for co-am this would not apply
to traditional lottery games like
scratch-offs and others AP would be
allowed for more transparent rule making
process with notice in writing with a
period so the master licensee or the
tenant or the location owner would have
time to respond in writing
it affords a lottery a recognizable
standards with rules when there's
challenges between licensees and
location owners as well with that Mr
President be happy to answer any
questions or yield the well
you have no question Senator but would
you like to speak to your Amendment
yes I did you did okay all right so you
have you have no questions so thank you
Mr President will
recognize the senator from the 46 to
speak to his amendments
thank you
thank you
senator from the 18th what purpose do
you rise
sorry
no it's they all strike the same thing
thank Mr President
ladies and gentlemen I didn't see this
on our desk that it was coming this
quickly so I'm trying to get my notes
together on the Amendments that we have
a couple things about co-am we've spent
some time on this subject matter over
the last few years these are coin
operated Amusement machines they're
essentially slot machines you see them
in the grocery stores and well the
convenience stores and gas stations
they're usually back in the back in the
dark areas
and sometimes you'll see people sitting
there at them for hours and sometimes
you'll see them where they're just empty
where nobody's even playing on
they are
pretty close to slot machines they try
to tell you that they're a game of skill
but I can tell you in other states they
call this distributed gaming
and what that is is one owner of the
slot machines distributes them in many
locations around the state rather than
putting them in one central location
like a casino
this bill does several things to really
put that industry on steroids so to
speak
right now if you play a coin operated
Amusement machine and you win
you're only paid in merchandise at the
store they're promotional
and that was their intention they're
controlled through the Georgia Lottery
so the proceeds the profits go to the
master licensees that own the machines
they go to the location licensees that
put the machines out for the public to
play
and only 10 percent goes to the Lottery
Commission
to be distributed amongst Pre-K programs
and hope scholarships
that's vastly different than most of the
rest of the nation
for example in Illinois
they divide the proceeds one-third
one-third one-third
the state of Illinois gets a third of
the profits the master licensees that on
the machines get a third of the profits
and the location licensees that have
their machines there for play get a
third of the profits
and that's much closer to what the state
of Georgia's statutes require the
Lottery Commission
to earn on the draw games and the
scratch-off games those lottery games
we have a statute that requires them to
generate 35 return to the state or as
close as practicable
they have not been very good at doing
that over the years
one time they were down to receiving
only 23 to 25 percent
finally here in the last few years
they're getting up closer to 26 or 27
percent
the national average of lotteries is 30
percent
when you're talking about six billion
dollars
in sales that's a lot of money
when we had our problem with the
Lottery funding going down and not able
to fund hope scholarships as high as we
once did
one time we got down to about 80 percent
now thank goodness we're with this
Governor we're back up to 100 percent
funding of Our Hope scholarships
but at one time when money was down you
know I had done the math on that an
extra
five percent was about 50 million a
percentage point would have getting us
gotten us up another 250 million we
would have never had to cut
the lottery
what you have now is you have a
situation
where the lottery is generating over 6
billion a year in sales and 1.5 billion
in profits
that goes to Hope and Pre-K
the same department is running these
slot machines the co-am machines that
they're getting
10 percent of the profits
but I think you're going to hear
centered from the 52nd run through the
numbers that it's really more like three
percent of the sales
so we are cannibalizing ourself
we are offering products that pay
significantly lower return to our
taxpayers
then scratch off tickets do or Draw
games do
it's crazy for us to incentivize this
and try to increase play on these
machines
for this piddly little return
so Amendment two that I'll speak to
First changes that to be more in line
with Georgia law and with the national
Norms what happens in other states
so you'll see on line seven it
line seven it raises the percentage
going to the state to 35 percent to
being
sync with what our statute requires
and what other states do so that if
people decide to play co-ams more
instead of they're spending their money
on scratch-offs or Draw games at least
the state will generate the same income
from it
and it takes the remainder and it splits
it between the master licensee
and the location licensee at 32 and a
half percent each
it's important to know that because
people cannot
spend their winnings on anything other
than merchandise
we do not let them buy alcohol with it
and we do not let them buy tobacco
products with it
but we do let them buy lottery tickets
with their winnings
and there are vendors that say in many
stores
over 50 percent of the lottery tickets
sold are from winnings on the co-am
games
and that's the other big problem with
this bill and I'll speak briefly
to Amendment four
this completely changes the industry
so instead of now turning in your
winnings like a ticket as if you were in
Chuck E cheese for a prize you can now
get a gift card
you can get a debit card essentially
that spins just like cash anywhere in
the world
so you no longer have to spend it at the
store that's trying to get your business
and you can spend it on alcohol
food
anything else you want to buy
so we get rid of those
limitations that we've put on it so far
it makes it more like casino gambling
just a row of six slot machines in every
corner convenience store instead of in a
casino
I believe you're going to end up
with more sales and that's why the
industry's been pushing this for a
couple of years
and you're going to end up reducing
your lottery ticket sales so you're
going to give up something that you're
making 27 for something that you're
making three percent unless we pass
Amendment two
Amendment four
makes it even simpler
continue with the co-am machines
whatever other changes are in the bill
but don't allow these gift cards that is
changing the nature of this game to
promoting widespread gambling in the
state of Georgia without any citizen
input on that
so what I would ask you to
vote Yes for Amendment two
to give the state of Georgia a fair
return on its investment here
and I would ask you to vote Yes for
Amendment four
uh I believe that's the one that deletes
is that is that the wrong one
says Dixon
of course
it deletes 34 through 294 which are the
gift card portions
and with that I'll take any questions
there may be
you I'm sorry Senator I couldn't hear
you would you I'm happy to take any
questions you do have a question Senator
Senator from the 26.
senator from the 16th
thank you Mr President
Senator Gill I yield
let me ask this be the current situation
is that our gift cards are in a
merchandise giving and we're going to
give them and as I understand it now a
debit card or a card that can be
converted into cash is that correct
that's correct what would keep a a store
or a vendor from taking that card and
cashing it and keeping money back on
that card is there any provision to keep
that from becoming kind of a how do you
say a discount on on cash cards if you
will and converting that money just to
play the machines again
I've heard many anecdotes that that is
what happens with many many folks that
they'll trade a discounted amount of
cash for a card
so they could cash the card to play the
machines more
well you can yeah you can get cash money
for the card if you can talk somebody
into buying your card from you
give them a discounted price they
probably would do that it becomes an
underground type currency really is what
it becomes that we don't have now
whatever needs to be done whether it's
drugs alcohol or whatever we then
convert those prize winnings back into
something that can be not traced I think
so okay thank you sir
Senator you you have no more questions
thank you I yield the well
recognize the senator from the 52nd
thank you Mr President
the previous Senator was being generous
when he said 10 percent
the hope is 27 yeah it should be more
than that but it's 27 percent of the
gross amount
the co-ams is 10 of the net amount
which is around 30 percent so it's of
the gross total of sales is three
percent is what the state gets versus 27
percent
on the hope
if this passes
a co-am that's hurting us because it's
cannibalizing the lottery will hurt us
even more because then those cards will
be used as cash to go elsewhere whereas
right now they can be used for lottery
tickets it will decrease sales
of
the cash cow for hope
that we get 27 percent of
it will hurt children going to school if
we pass this in this form
in 2013 when this was voted in and South
Carolina voted it down and took all the
machines out
everybody said there's no way they'll
get cash from these we've got a system
that won't allow it now the solution is
to give them cash
so that they can
get in the form of a credit card and be
used as a card for cash and again
since they can swap men right now for
lottery tickets there will be less of
that done and more keeping the cash
and less children will be able to get
100 Hope from this bill this is a
terrible bill
it will hurt the Hope Lottery if we pass
that I yield the will
senator from the fourth you would speak
on the measure
thank you Mr President
um
I'd like to say a couple quick things on
this if this is such a bad if a co-am
machine is such a bad deal
we've got 145 million dollars last year
went to the lottery
145 million dollars went to Lottery and
if you talk to the lottery people that
have put in these gift cards they'll
tell you that they are exceeding
expectations
and and the most you can put in a
machine at one time is five dollars you
can't sit there and do it forever and
ever and ever and put put in hundred
dollars five hundred dollars a thousand
dollars you put in five dollars a time
so it limits it the great thing about it
for me if I was playing a gift card
would be that I could stop by and pick
up my laundry on the way home
I could take my wife out to dinner that
night I could buy gas
and yes you are taking money away from
the from the stores right there but
you're taking it and putting it in other
stores so to sell you're not losing the
sales tax they're going to another store
this is a good bill we need to pass this
this will add more money to the lottery
and will help educate our children
please press green on this Bill thank
you
I recognize senator from the 26. speak
to the measure
thank you uh Mr President ladies and
gentlemen let me tell you something this
ain't been going around 25 years
25 years let me tell you what used to
happen
they used to give gift certificates
when they gave the gift certificate you
didn't have a problem about folks paying
out cash you didn't have gays going
around the stoves putting up yellow tape
locking Folks up
taking money for illegal payouts
now what the gift card does is this
takes the cash out the game
be like a debit card
but
if you want to go on the black market
and try to sell it
for less than what is worth
then go right ahead but it will allow
you to go to Walmart
go to the grocery store to get some
groceries
it would allow you to do things
and you would get a tick
in the sales tax
because when you smell them and when you
use them you got to pay the sales tax on
the
project
you got to pay the sales tax
they pay one of the highest taxes
it's 10 percent of the gross
10 percent of the gross
is what the lottery gets
then not only that
between the owner and the tenant
they got to pay taxes on their profit
too
so uh roughly you looking at about 17
percent
it's what you're looking at
but what we are talking about
is getting the DA's
out the game rather than locking up
folks
for illegal payouts
you got a card now
that you'll be able to take the while
I'm out of Krogers
or somewhere and spin it
and of course you got to pay the sales
tax
so we will have an uptick
and sales tax revenue
and that we not raise the taxes on
anybody
that's what this bill does
that's what it does it's 25 years ago
and the reason I can tell you about it I
did a filibust on it
Roy Barnes
and we will call back in special session
to deal with co-am
and we've had nothing but problems when
we gave the gift certificate we didn't
have any problems with it and business
was five
and so what I'm saying to you this is a
chance
did not have folks locked up for
illegal pan out of cash
and they can get these cards
they and and let's let's talk about it
they're not playing here for sardines
they plan to get something
they are playing to get something
and you use the card
to do it
and we get the sales tax off the car
because when they use the the card to
buy products they have to pay the sales
tax with it
that's what it does
everybody come with all these excuses
about it the problem is it's been cash
payout and once we stopped giving the
gift certificates we had the problems
about the cash pay out now you take it
to the card they find out that the cards
do work
the cards do work and we do get an
uptick in sales tax money
and that's all it does and what I would
ask you to do is vote for the
gentleman's uh Amendment
to the bill
and defeat all other amendments
defeat them
plain I defeat them let's deal with the
card and take the cash out the game
Senator Senator from the 28th would like
to ask you a question I believe the man
for making well he comes back here he
comes back
I'm not scared of you
[Laughter]
senator
you better be
do you yield Senator I do
senator
would you say this bill is all about the
money it's all about the Benjamins
and you know what a Benjamin is that's
the face on a hundred dollar bill
I ain't seen one of them in a long time
Senators
you need to get out the pool house
you
I do so how do you do that
yeah
go make you some money
play play the lottery hit the number
you got to play some doubles the only
thing I can tell you you can't hit the
number the number got to hit you
[Laughter]
but
I sat beside him but for 10 years I I
can tell you right now when I asked him
to make change for me one day he said I
thought a hundred was changed you know
all right Senator you don't have any
more questions thank you I think I know
where you are on this vote though
there's no question about it I'm voting
for the amendment and I'm gonna vote for
the bill and vote against all other
amendments
all right center has yielded
all right
I recognize the senator from the 42nd to
speak to her Amendment
thank you I'll be brief I I want to
present Amendment Three hopefully
everyone has received it and can find it
on their desk
this amendment is simply to ensure
transparency and consistency by the
Georgia Lottery Corporation and it's
dealing with all the um various coin
operated Amusement machine business
interests under this amendment if a
licensee or another business interest
comes to GLC and requests an opinion on
whether certain practices are considered
legal and proper under the law or
regulations if the Lottery Corporation
renders an opinion it must actually
publish that opinion on its website so
that all interested parties within the
co-am industry will be aware of what is
and what is not permitted examples of
when that happens is when it interprets
a uh a statute administered by it or any
rule or regulation adopted they're under
makes a recommendation about possible
enforcement
or whether an exception should be
granted and this just makes it so that
everyone is aware who's within the
industry what what the what the GLC has
said is and is not legal so everyone can
be on the same page and abide by the
same rule so it's just a transparency
Amendment happy to answer any questions
if any of my colleagues have any
you have a question from the senator
from 26.
thank you um
what the sound of the Year certainly to
my good friend and the two uh Senator I
misspoke I signed that Amendment but uh
everyone uh
likes the
Dixon Amendment and and felt like that
if the Dixon Amendment passed
then that would not be necessary if we
defeated all other amendments I
understand what Defenders saying thank
Senator happy to answer any further
questions or yield the wealth senator
Senator yields well you're the well
thank you so much
does any other Senator wish to speak for
against measure
chair here is done is there objection to
the previous question being ordered
chair has done the previous question is
ordered
I recognize senator from the 45th who
closed debate
thank you Mr President one thing I do
want to make clear the the gift card is
already legal I'm holding one here
issued by the Georgia Lottery
Corporation it's a MasterCard uh simply
what this bill originally was going to
do it was going to codify this in law
this is currently an executive order
they are being used throughout the state
they've been being rolled out since last
session or since last summer
they are very popular some of the issues
that we're seeing uh if there's a store
on one corner that's that's using the
the state issued gift card and then if
you've got a store on another corner and
I've had several of these issues arise
and heard countless stories
the convenience store across the street
is not using the gift cards still using
the uh just basically the receipt that
you get in the store and you can use it
for buying anything on premise
there's an issue with some some of those
stores giving cash inducements or cash
payouts this gift card would eliminate
that and you'll see that now where
you've got the gift card being used
across the street where it's not all the
folks are gambling are using the co-ed
machines across the street where they
don't have the gift card if we legalize
the gift card it would level the playing
field it would do away with a lot of the
inducements and a lot of the issues
within the industry just wanted to say
that to you but also wanted to make you
aware I know some of y'all are hearing
from the senator from the 26 and I
couldn't agree with you more and all
with your statement he called it the
Dixon Amendment it's actually amendment
number four it does delete there were
eight Provisions we had in in the bill
originally it deletes seven of those it
just leaves the APA in there so I'm
strongly urging you to vote no on the
first three amendments vote Yes for
Amendment four Mr President be happy to
answer any questions or yield well
all right
so the previous question has been
ordered and the senator from the 45th
has closed debate we're going to go
um we're going to go on the Amendments
we're going to go a little bit out of
order we're going to start with
Amendment two
on the questions on the adoption
Amendment two is their objection to
Amendment two
there is objection Amendment two all
those in favor Amendment two will vote
yay all those opposed nay secretary and
lock the machine
on the adoption Amendment to the Azar 25
the days are 29 and this amendment has
failed
the question is on the adoption
Amendment Three Amendment Three authored
by the senator from the 42nd is their
objection to Amendment Three
it is objection Amendment Three

right
the senator knows what he speaks
on the adoption Amendment Three the A's
are 24 and the Nays are 31 and amendment
3 has failed
the now we're on to Amendment four
and
if
if Amendment four passes there will be
no need to take up Amendment one that's
why we went out of order so
the question is on the adoption

favor of amendment four will vote yay
all opposed Nays secretary Enlightenment

us go to using the card and get the cash
out the game Senator knows this subject
matter barely better than anybody
foreign
the adoption of amendment four the Azar
53 and the Nays are two and this

yield I'll yield perhaps I could have
asked you these questions uh while you
were sitting next to me but you kind of
surprised me when you when you put this
off the table so can you elaborate on
what taxes are being Exempted is it like
for example if it's a a project of
regional significance I would assume
there's going to be a bulldozer there
and is there going to be a tax like a
yearly property tax exemption on that
bulldozer is it just a sales tax when
they sell the bulldozer there there it
is a competitive project so there could
be State money put in it could be sales
tax it could be different things there's
only been 18 of them in the history of
Georgia these are used very selectively
um but it has
about 75 percent of them are outside the
Atlanta metro area that have been done

of projects coming down I-16 uh and I've

to who is it going to to benefit uh can

be done on projects that made a certain
criteria of large amounts
