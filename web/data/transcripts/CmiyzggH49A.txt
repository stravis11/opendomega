TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good morning everybody, welcome to the final meeting of our study committee on foster
care and adoption, and I'm going to ask Senator Jackson to open us in prayer.
What's your mic then, ma'am?
11.
Okay.
Holy God, we thank you so much for the opportunity to be in a position to care for your children.
We pray especially for all children who are in foster care, who find themselves in need
of a home, a loving home.
We pray for all children who are in danger, who are afraid, for those who are in detention,
For those who've run away, we pray also for foster parents and for biological parents who
struggle to make decisions to care well for their children.
We pray that you would guide this committee and guide the General Assembly that we might
make laws and institute rules that will care well for all.
Amen.
Thank you.
Over the last few months, we've heard over a dozen hours of testimony in this committee
and it's been a lot like drinking out of a fire hose for many of us.
From experts and also from the public, there's been a lot of public interest in this committee
and we really have an opportunity to make a positive change in our state.
We've got the juvenile court judges represented back there, John, thanks for two y'all for
been here and I wanted to highlight a couple things that have been in the news. One is that the
Georgia foster care tax credit launched January 1st and if anybody's interested in more
information about that, please help us get the word out about that. And then I also wanted to
highlight something that was in the news yesterday about the Cherokee County which is in my district
juvenile courts receiving over $740,000 in grant funding for their family courts and they're
going to develop a family court system there so that is directly related to what we've been
working on here and very excited about that. I wanted to thank the committee members for their
engagement. Every member has made great suggestions and I really appreciate the hard work especially
in reviewing all the material that was presented to us
several the last few months.
That's a heavy lift.
We've had support from Senate staff, including Hannah Holcomb
and Karen Edwards, our administrative assistance.
Mary Akkins from Senate Research is over there.
And she's been doing this on the fly with me
over the weekend.
Greatly appreciated Holly Carter from Ledge Lab Council
down there and our wonderful Senate press staff.
Emily is back there running the show.
And we've had also a lot of support
from the Lieutenant Governor's office
and his staff, Ennis Owens, especially.
She's here with us today.
And he really emphasized the importance of this issue
by creating the Children and Families Committee
and supporting the Study Committee.
So that is definitely very helpful
in accomplishing our goals in the legislative session.
The attention and resources brought
by the Department of Human Services has been extraordinary.
And although she's in a hearing this morning,
we really owe a debt of thanks to Commissioner Broche
and her staff who actually highlighted the hotel issue
and others for the General Assembly
during her budget presentation two years ago.
The members of the public who attended our meetings,
many of whom were here today,
and submitted material for review,
were very helpful to our work.
The final report and recommendations
were a result of every committee members reviewing
and prioritizing the massive amount of material
we heard and read.
The draft report was reviewed by the committee
over the last few days and additional suggestions were made.
The end result is what we're going to go over today.
It's important to realize that the work on behalf
of our foster kids will never be finished.
And this committee's work is just a strong start.
We spotlighted some areas that need future work
in addition to the recommendations in the report.
And we know we can't reach all our goals in one year.
That's not how we operate at the general assembly sadly.
Some of our recommendations will require legislation.
Others will be budget items.
And some can be accomplished by the agency
without legislative intervention.
We're not going to have public testimony today,
but members of the public are still welcome
to submit written material for review,
and we'll get that to the committee.
I'll now walk through the report focusing
on the recommendations as the bulk of the report
documents the testimony that we heard
at our three previous meetings.
And then we'll answer any questions from committee members
and then vote on the report
as we are slated to finish our work by December 1st,
along with the other study committees.
I did make one addition to the report committee members.
That's not in there.
And I'll make sure that's OK with you all
before we finish today.
So if you go to page 15 of the report that's in your folder,
we'll just briefly go through the recommendations
and the committee each gave members
each gave their input on what their priority items were,
and we put all that together.
Number one is permanency.
The timeline for getting foster children to permanency,
whether through reunification or adoption is very important.
There are existing statutory reporting requirements
within the juvenile court system,
but there are data limitations due to the lack
of a uniform statewide reporting system.
Legislation to create a uniform reporting system
reportable to the general assembly should be considered.
Number two was state identification cards.
Children in care currently face difficulties
in obtaining state IDs, photo IDs.
And these difficulties prevent many challenges,
present many challenges for foster children,
especially related to driving and employment.
Legislation to provide free, easily obtainable state
federal IDs to foster children should be considered.
Number three is case manager retention.
High turnover among case managers within defects
and other child placement agencies.
Both public and private is problematic.
Possible solutions include increased salaries,
more training to include trauma informed care,
and more resources to connect to non-governmental groups
that provide services to at-risk families and children.
Contractoring with a closed loop referral tracking system
will be highly beneficial for case managers looking
for community resources.
And I already mentioned at our first meeting
that the department is working on an agreement
with you nine to us and they're here today,
and can answer questions afterward if needed.
Number four is legitimation.
It was highlighted that the process of becoming
the legal father of a child is cumbersome in Georgia
and slows the timeline to permanency.
Understanding that this is a complicated issue
with potential downstream effects that we need
to be careful about, legislation to streamline this process
with protections for victims of domestic violence
and others should be considered.
Number five, expanding infant toddler courts,
which are referred to sometimes as safe baby courts,
sometimes as family courts,
but they're directed towards young children, zero to three.
And we have piloted, we're working on a pilot
of those courts due to the model success in other states.
And so Georgia now has a federal grant
for three pilot sites that we heard about
during our testimony.
These courts focus on comprehensive support
of at-risk families with infants and toddlers,
promotes successful reunification,
and feature enhanced attention to unmet mental health needs
of parents whenever necessary.
Their expansion in Georgia could prevent many children
from entering or returning to the foster care system.
Number six, foster an adoptive parent retention.
Many foster parents leave the system due to redundant paperwork and other process issues.
And a significant proportion of foster and adoptive placements dissolve because of an adequate
support to manage formidable mental health challenges of the children.
Many of these issues can be handled by DHS without legislation because they relate to laws
that already exist.
we recommend expansion and access to training to foster and adoptive parents in trauma-informed
care, and that all future compliance appraisals mandated by the 2022 Georgia Mental Health
Parity Act include a separate analysis that exclusively considers the state's foster
and adoptive children, given their unique vulnerability to violations in mental health
parity as a critical step in ensuring ready access to necessary
valuation and treatment services.
The one that I would like to add at the pleasure of the committee,
number seven would be to recommend adjusting the adoption
assistance rates in Georgia, which have not been adjusted
since 2009.
And we heard that at our third meeting and I missed it
when I was reviewing the material.
In addition to these recommendations,
the committee had additional ideas
for future improvements.
Number one, strengthening residential treatment options
for foster children with complex needs.
As part of the larger conversation
in Georgia about mental health and substance use,
the use of opioid litigation settlement funds
should be considered.
And I actually have a conversation set up this afternoon
with Commissioner Tanner,
and he's already heard about this.
So we'll see what happens.
Number two, protection of children
being transported across state lines.
We learned at our third meeting
about the Uniform Unregulated Child Custody Transfer Act.
And it should be considered due to trafficking concerns.
We ran out of time to look into,
to do a deep dive into that.
Number three was a unique program
that we heard about called Hannah with Care,
used by some law enforcement agencies
which notify schools when one of their students
has been involved in a traumatic event of any kind.
These programs have been very beneficial
in the district where they're used and should be expanded.
And number four, provisions for ensuring
that foster and adoptive parents themselves,
in addition to the children,
have appropriate access to mental health services
when necessary to persevere in their pivotal role.
Members of the committee, as well as the standing Senate
committee on children and families will continue this work
during the upcoming session and beyond.
And with that, I would like to take any questions
from the committee, but I'd also like to ask
for approval of recommendation number seven,
which is to increase the adoption assistance rates.
Yes, Madam Chair, to the question number seven,
are we speaking specifically to the monthly assistance
that people receive or and the amount of legal assistance.
So there's a fun for legal assistance.
Are we speaking about both of those funds increasing?
Are we talking specifically about the monthly, right?
I was actually talking about the monthly,
but I don't think there would be any limitation
on looking at the whole package.
All right, thanks.
I just want to make clear.
And I certainly would approve that if that's the will of the buy.
Does anybody object to adding number seven
to our recommendations?
Any other specific questions or comments about the report?
Julie.
I would just say to Senator Jackson's comment, I think referring to it maybe as recurring
and non-recurring is how they, and then also maybe look at the, I mean there are other
funds that foster parents can have access to as well, but the recurring and the non-recurring
are the main ones.
Thank you for adding that.
Okay, we got it.
Thank you.
Anything else?
I don't know.
I'm wondering, I love the item number four on the additional.
And I'm wondering if we might consider adding that
to recommendation six above.
As soon as how it's so related.
So let me find my page.
yes. Could you repeat that? So I like the additional recommendations and
recommendation for about the provision for ensuring that foster and adoptive
parents themselves have appropriate access to mental health. I'm wondering if
we might consider adding that to recommendation six above. In my opinion they
of those things go hand in hand with the children they're caring for.
Any discussion about that?
I don't object to it.
I think we're going to need more than this upcoming session to deal with that is the
only reason that we put it in the future recommendations that doesn't mean we
can't work on it now. No he's talking about under the future
recommendations number four which is provisions for ensuring that the
parents have appropriate access to mental health services he's talking about
Not moving that under number six in the committee recommendations.
I think that number, that provision is something that DHS could work on without legislation.
So I think it would be appropriately appropriate to move it to number six.
I don't think legislation would be required for DHS to put a focus on mental health care
for post-election.
Okay, so the way that would work is we've got a little sub-paragraph one and two that
would become sub-paragraph three and would move from the future recommendations to the
recommendations for now from the committee.
make sense, Mary? Okay. Any objections to that? Okay. Good. Other questions? Okay. I'm
not seeing any. So at this point, I think we're ready to vote on the report as with the changes
that we've made, which were two, it's moving that one recommendation up to the body of
the report and then adding recommendation
for recurring and non-recurring adoption assistance rates.
Okay.
With that?
Oh, you want to make a motion?
Hang on one second.
Wow.
Okay.
Yes, Madam Chairwoman.
Thank everybody for all the work we've done.
I'm proud of all of us and just in what this meant.
And I'd just like to move that we've as amended here on the community today to go ahead
and pass that out into the committee.
We have a second.
A second.
Okay.
A second by Senator Jackson.
A motion by Senator Payne.
All in favor?
Raise your hand.
Any opposed?
Great.
Thank you all so much for your hard work.
And again, we can't do all of this at the same time.
I think we've got a clear picture of where we stand in Georgia now with foster care and adoption
and I really appreciate everybody's hard work and look forward to moving the ball down the field.
So thank you very much, we're adjourned.
