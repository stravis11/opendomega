Representative, I don't know about you. Do you still have yours? OK. OK. We're going to go ahead and do the panoramic picture. And then let the guys take down their equipment. And then we'll come back in and follow the normal course of roll call and our devotion and take care of our business. I'll take your photo. OK. All right. You got a mic. You have a mic. OK. OK. Mr. Pearl. OK. Folks. My name is George Pearl. I've run Atlanta Legal Photo Services for 43 years. Start it back in 1978. And I have a little division of that Atlanta panorama where we shoot huge groups of people. And in case you've never been in a panorama picture, it's just a long skinny photo with a lot of people in it. So this is from 2019. So you can see what we're trying to achieve here. OK. Now, the way this is taken is in parts. And then it's all put together. The camera will rotate around. Some of these people are actually seated behind me at the moment. So the camera will cover them and then come on around and get the rest of you. And there'll be a bright light that's going to hit you in the face as the camera comes around to your photo area. And that means that your picture is being taken. So now, I don't want you to call me up after I display these pictures in the any room for sale over there, which I hope you'll buy. Because we're not paid to come down here and do this. Way back, I remember the speaker of the house, Tom Murphy, gave me a call. And he said, George, I want you to come down and shoot a group photo for us. And I said, yeah, where? What? And he says, the house are representatives. And I said, yeah, OK. I'll try to do that. And he said, yeah, well, it better be good. And he's not with us anymore. I wonder any of y'all still here from Tom Murphy days? All right. Good. That's great. What a great guy. Well, I'm still working for him all this time. So anyway, we're going to shoot this picture. And I'd like for you to do a little cleanup if you haven't done it already on your desk. We don't need all these Coca-Cola bottles. I know Coke is it, but it's not in a panorama group photo. So let's get rid of them. I think they're all gone. Let's take all the mask off and just hide them in your desk. Staff is going to line each side of the room. Staff, come down. Come down, staff. Keep coming. Come on, down. Feel some space here. Come on down. On the other side, well, we hardly have any staff over there. When, come on down, come on down. You're going the wrong way. I want you to fill this area right here. Come on down. There you go. Well, somebody's left a little brown cap over here on one of these chairs. It needs to go. OK, people with mask, you're not going to be in my picture. OK, because I don't want to have a bunch of people with their faces hit. Am I getting through to you or what are we going to do or behind you? OK, that looks good. OK, y'all look good. All right, do we have everything put away? Speaker, I think you dropped a card or something. Your ID, what is that down there? I don't know what that is. I don't know what that is. OK, remember as the camera comes around the light hits you, put on a happy face. Don't call me later and say, I don't like how I look, because that's up to you. It isn't up to me. OK, somebody actually did that once. OK, I'm going to have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit. Somebody actually did that once. OK, well, I'm ready to go, Mr. Speaker, if you'd like to take your position out here in the middle. And do we have the other staff used to stand behind you? OK, wherever you'd like them to be. assistance or whatever. Okay, Mr. Speaker, just back up just a little bit more, please sir. Okay, hold it, hold it, hold it. Come up some, come up some, you can come up, come up a little, come on up, Mr. Speaker, come on up, come on up, come on up, come on, come on, come on, there you go, stop, that's good. Okay. All right, here we go. Let's start shooting. Come and ride around. Come on, ride around now. I need to kind of reach the picture. Or I'll be in the picture. That's good. Really, you all look good today. Now we're going to do this again, so don't think that that was it. Okay, I'm going to come right where I was and go around the other way now. Okay, here we go. On to three. That's nice. Coming right here. Very good, very good. That's nice. Oh, you look really official. And all the people from the wall just dropped their hands down so that they're by your side. That would look better. There you go. See, they're even waving at me over here. That's nice. That's the heck I got your attention. I'm going to go back. Okay, good, happy faces. This would be the last run. Right around, right around. That's great. That's great. You all look good. You look good. Now, when I get through shooting this picture, I'm going to go back to my studio and we're going to print them out. And we're going to frame a couple. And we're going to display these in that any room over there with order forms so that you can just place an order if you like the picture. If you don't like the picture, that's okay. Sorry. But I hope you like it. Good enough to order one for me. And then we will deliver it directly to your office if you're here at the Capitol or the CLOB. Thank you for your attention and your support.

If so, the clerk will lock the machines. The clerk keepers will please close the doors and keep them closed. Good morning. Almost afternoon after all that excitement. We will begin our day now with Scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the lady from the 83rd House District Representative Becky Evans. Representative Evans. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. I am so grateful to have the opportunity to introduce my friend, who is a longtime friend of so many of yours, our pastor of the day, the Reverend Dr. William E. Flippin Senior. Dr. Flippin is the visionary pastor of the Greater Piney Grove Baptist Church in Atlanta. He's a native of National Tennessee and has a BA in mathematics and business administration from Fisk University, a master of divinities, degree, cum laude from Emory's Candler School of Theology, and a doctorate of ministry from Chicago's McCormick Theological Seminary. As he understands that ministry is holistic in nature, he's also certified as a life transformational coach and a leadership coach trainer. Since 1990, Dr. Flippin has led the congregation of the Greater Piney Grove Baptist Church, and in that time, the church has witnessed significant growth with new facilities and establishing over 14 ministries to meet the emotional, spiritual, and physical needs of the congregation and community and ordaining over 100 new ministers and deacons. And understanding that the church cannot live apart from the community, Dr. Flippin is established at the Grove as a key stakeholder for the people of Atlanta and the cab. The church has actively engaged with the community through many initiatives, including the NAACP, its outreach center, annual holiday giving, self-help programs, and Pastor Flippin is president of the DeCab juvenile justice council, and that's how I've gotten to know him. And finally, the church is extremely proud of the new affordable senior living complex built under his leadership, completed in 2020, the Grove Gardens at East Lake Senior Living Community. He's the founder and CEO of several nonprofits, a former chaplain of the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, an accomplished author of six books and an international preacher and teacher. Dr. Tipin firmly believes that God has commissioned him for the purpose of raising leaders and to that end, he has dedicated his life to be a mentor to pastors, ministers, community, and business leaders. He's married to Sylvia Taylor Flippin, and together there, the proud parents of four children, three sons who have continued the family preaching legacy, one daughter and two grandchildren. So I first met Pastor Flippin when I experienced the power of God's love and worship and community at Greater Piney Grove in 2018. I'm so grateful that God gave me the opportunity to serve on the board of the cab juvenile justice council under his leadership. When he interviewed me for the board, he was so welcoming and interested in getting to know me, just like he is in all of you that he engages with. Dr. Flippin is warm, humble, and gracious, and he knows how to inspire, engage and encourage all those who work around him. He's an effective leader with a heart for God and God's people. He's the spiritual leader across Atlanta and to Canada. Please join me in welcoming our pastor of the day, Reverend Dr. William E. Flippin, Senior. Pastor Flippin. You can clap if you want to. Good morning. Well, it has been a heck of a morning hasn't it? But a very interesting one. Speaker Ralston, thank you for the opportunity to stand before this wonderful, group of men and women to representative Becky Evans. And I said, if I start calling names, I'm going to mess up Al Williams. But I have to recognize the Dean of the House, Calvin Smiley. Congratulations son. And if you need anybody to pray in the Dominican Republic, I'll be glad to give you my card. I have a lot of friends here that I've worked with over the years. And the last time I did the prayer, Speaker Murphy was here, that's a long time, isn't it? When my daughter was a little girl and she was preparing to go to bed at night, I went into her room and said, let's say I pray as joy. She knelt down by the bed, folded her little hands. And for about 15 seconds, I tapped her. I said, sweetheart, I don't hear nothing. She looked at her daddy, the pastor, educated, supposed to know everything about prayer. She looked at me and she said, I ain't talking to you. So let us talk to God. The God, the creator of all things. We stand in this place that governs the lives of men, women, boys and girls in the great state of Georgia. It's 1889 when the city of Atlanta deeded the state these five acres where we are this very moment, the people's business has been conducted. Almost 150 years, elected officials have gathered with the intent to govern fairly and with equity. However, too often progress has been hindered by division and opposing opinions. Yet, Georgia still stands as the crown jewel of the self. We pray that each of you will come to a place of common vision that will advance the lives of all citizens in our state. And we are counting on you. Without vision, the people will perish. And unfortunately, too many in our state are perishing. So Lord, help us and these wonderful men and women to arrive at a new creative imagination that will allow us to see beyond our own interests, special interests and their influences. And the partisan divide that keeps us apart and not trusting one another. May we be reminded and renewed to address the mandate that is in all major world religions. Remember the poor. Remember the less fortunate. Remember the elderly. Remember the abused. Many in this chamber have been blessed to be selected by their peers to make decisions that will affect so many. Many of us must never forget and must recall that we did also live in poverty and lack. Many of us have come to this place from humble beginnings all over Georgia. Many of us must remember that we once looked over and ignored. Very few of us were born with a silver spoon in our mouth. We only came to this place here today because someone thought enough of us to give us an opportunity. They saw something in us and motivated us to live a more productive and abundant life. So Lord, I pray that no matter what station we're in, what successes we have made, what our financial portfolios have become, Lord, let us never forget our small beginnings. But let us never forget those who are still trying to exist in those humble beginnings. May we never forget that it takes a village to change society. Dear Lord, help us to never forget to serve the needs, the last and the lost. We pray this day that we will leave here not being guilty, like the two men in the New Testament on the Jericho Road, the priests and the Levite leaders, religious leaders that passed the injured man. We do not know exactly where they were headed, but we do know that they saw the need and passed by to take care of their own agenda. But one man, a Samaritan, half Jew, half Gentile, and outcast in that day, he had been ridiculed as the lowest and low in society, but he stopped and helped the man get assistance. So I pray that we would leave these sessions being good Samaritans from North Georgia with his beautiful, majestic mountains, South Georgia with his beautiful seashell, black, white, Hispanic, Democrat, Republican, independent. May we all come to that place that we will serve this present age, how calling to fulfill. Lord, a few days ago, we celebrated the 93rd birthday of Prophet Martin Luther King, Jr., and how we long for his dream of the beloved community to become a reality. May we step up to the God-given rights to all to be judged and valued by others, not by the color of our skin, but the content of our character. We pray in the name of our God. Let us all say, Amen. Let us do the pledge. May we just rely on the United States of America and to the Republic of which it stands, one nation on the individual liberty and justice for all.

The Chairman and Committee on Small Business Development, the following report, may speak to your committee on Small Business Development, or Committee substitute, Representative Taylor 173rd District Chairman, All right, we're going on now to morning orders. We're going on to morning orders. The Chair wants to remind all members that we are operating under the mask mandate. In the protocols you received before session began. So, mask up, safety of those around you. All right, on morning orders. We've got a lot of morning orders today. Chair is going to limit morning orders to one minute each, and here's what we're going to do. At the end of a minute, the mic cuts off. Just cuts off. I'm not going to warn you. That takes up time. So, the mic will be terminated after one minute. Chair recognizes Representative Scofield for a morning order. All right. Representative Scofield is not here. She will put her down for tomorrow. We're not going to give a second chance today. Chair recognizes Chairman Stevens for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'll speak fast. You may not know it, but this is a 30th anniversary of the great lottery, if you will. This was the vote that we took, and this body allowed to take for gaming 30 years ago. I want to recognize five people that were here, the Chairman of Swainsboro, the Chairman from Hartwell, the Chairman from Cutworth, and the Chair Lady of Martok and our US Ambassador, nominee from Columbus. That took some real guts, ladies and gentlemen, to give two million of your constituents the opportunity for the great equalizer and education, and 1.6 million families, the opportunity to get a head start. Thank you, gentlemen, and lady. Chair recognizes Representative Mitchell for a morning order, one minute. Thank you. Thank you. Today I rise to affirm our support for upholding reproductive freedom on the occasion of the 29th anniversary of Roe versus Wade. January 22, 2022 marked the 49th anniversary of the Supreme Court's landmark decision on Roe versus Wade, which affirmed that everyone has a fundamental right to control their own reproductive decisions and to decide whether to continue a pregnancy or obtain an abortion, and which is supported by 70% of Georgia voters. Roe versus Wade continues to protect health and freedom and fatilitates gender equity and economic and financial participation in the United States. Interference with the access to safe and legalized abortion can lead to the rise of criminalization of pregnancy outcomes and the rise of incarceration of pregnant people. Thank you, Ana Yuluba. Chair recognizes Representative Rick Williams for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I just wanted to bring to everyone's attention over the weekend. We had a deputy sheriff get shot in Jones County. He made a traffic stop. Thank goodness he had on his vest. It saved his life. But this same, it was on channel two last night. The person who shot this deputy, the family had been pleading for help with mental help for this person. And so it just brings it again. Ladies and gentlemen, it's dangerous, but I want to salute our local law enforcement officers too. The sheriff's, the police, it put their life on the line every day. Thank you. Chair recognizes Representative Hutchinson for a morning order. Good morning colleagues. I know y'all missed me and I know you missed these kids. This is 14-year-old London. London wants to be a pediatrician. She's described as a thoughtful, helpful girl who likes swimming, making jewelry, participating in dance and gymnastics. She also enjoys reading comic books, listening to R&B music and watching TV, of course. She is one of many children who are available for adoption in the state of Georgia. Thank you very much and I yield the well. Chair recognizes Representative Angela Moore for a morning order. Good morning. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, member of the House, members of the House, I rise on the point of personal privilege to recognize a wonderful woman, the Honorable Talbert County Pro-Bate Magistrate Judge Cheryl Terry, who died suddenly at age 45 on Wednesday. Judged Terry, historically, was the first African-American woman judge in Talbert County. Having been elected in 2020, following the footsteps of our father and predecessor former Judge John R. Terry, who discovered his daughter's body at their shallow home, Judge Terry was an active member of the sorority to which I am a member, the Delta Sigma Theta sorority. Please stand and enjoy me in a moment of silence. Thank you. Chair recognizes Representative Gamble for a morning order. Representative Gamble, the clock is running on you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We just stand up here today to represent the 13th annual A-Rad day. Last year we had over 1100 people participate virtually, the year before 1300. And this is the focus to make sure that we are all recognizing our recovery community and that recovery is real. You should all be receiving one of these in your mailbox on your desks here soon. Thank you. Chair recognizes Representative Kendrick for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'd like to salute the 49th anniversary of Roe v Wade on January 22nd, 2022. Mark the 49th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark decision, which affirmed that everyone has a fundamental right to control their own reproductive decisions and to decide rather to continue a pregnancy or obtain an abortion, in which is supported by 70% of Georgia voters. In the past Georgia has introduced a number of pro-birth pieces of legislation, including the near total abortion ban at HB481. So in conclusion, if you do not have my uterus, I humbly ask that you not get in mind. Thank you. Chair recognizes Representative Jasmine Clark for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As my colleagues just mentioned, this weekend we celebrated the 49th anniversary of Roe v Wade decision and 49 years later, the constitutional protections for reproductive rights are in jeopardy. Here is what we know. We know that access to comprehensive reproductive health care, including abortion, contraception, prenatal care, labor and delivery services, and postpartum care are necessary for people's overall health regardless of race, gender identity, income level, and immigration status, and that health is a human right. As the fate of reproductive rights hangs in the balance, and 50 years later we continue to fight for equitable policies that ensure access to comprehensive and inclusive reproductive health care for all, my colleagues and I are committed to introducing legislation that addresses these barriers and inequities in access to reproductive health care. Chair recognizes Representative's hopson, burnout, Jones, Davis, Moore, and Jackson for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It is with great sorrow that we, the members of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Incorporated, share the passing of our beloved national president and chair of the National Board of Directors, Madam President Cheryl A. Hickman. President Hickman transitioned peacefully on January 20th, 2022 after a recent illness. Madam President Hickman was a devoted member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Incorporated since 1982 and served in various capacities at the chapter, region, and national levels before being elected our president. She is remembered not only for her role as being a leader but for being a colleague, friend, and most of all a sister. She truly lived the motto, don't measure life by the number of breaths you take, but the number of moments that you that take your breath away. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Hickman family and our Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Sisterhood. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. All right, we're going on now to announcements, going on to announcements.

Okay, we have one other important item of business to take up. You may want to hear this. If you wish to know when you're going to get finished this session, then I suggest you sit down and cease conversation. The majority leader has made some history with the Senate and before they change their mind, we're going to pass the adjournment resolution. They have been known to do that. Chair recognizes the majority leader of the House. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Let's vote before they reconsider over there, right? Well, Mr. Speaker, as always, items we have up with consideration with the Senate, we certainly appreciate your leadership and your steady hand as you help guide the conversations that take place. I will certainly give credit to my counterpart, leader Dugan, in the Senate, and certainly appreciate working with him in a spirit to make sure that we continue doing the work that we're led to do here. Speaker Ross, and always let's us know that we're here to serve the people of this state. And that's job one, and that's what this schedule that was put on your desk yesterday that you now see on the board that's been agreed to in the Senate. And I hope that you will join me in supporting this resolution that takes us from tomorrow till the end of this session on Signing Die. If you will, I'll go over it with you briefly. I think most of you had an opportunity to look at this. Thanks for the clerk's good work in his office. I'll make you sure that we receive this. I believe the days as we've laid them out are respectful of we as members of our family commitments and commitments back at home during the next month or so. And but more importantly, this schedule is respectful of the well-being of Georgians. It gives us an opportunity to make sure that we're deliberate as we always are as we consider a historic budget and as we consider legislation that will impact our people this state for years to come. So if you will follow me through this calendar very, and I'll go through it with you pretty quickly. Of course, the day is the last day of the current German resolution we're under. So this one we'll pick up with tomorrow on Wednesday, January, the, excuse me, on Thursday, January the 27th, will be out Friday and out Monday before we resume for legislative day 9 on Thursday February the 1st. If you'll follow through with me then we're out in those Tuesday Wednesday Thursday, out Friday, back in on Monday February the 7th and end on the 8th.

Now as you've seen on Saturday and Sunday there are possibility for committee work days you will need to be in touch with your committee chairs to make sure that we tend to the business of this house as we prepare for that all in Port at day of Monday April the 4th for sunny die. I think and I understand that there are plans made for that first part of April there are a lot of important things going on that first week of April with our families in our state and I believe this is respectful of those plans and the priorities that we all have in our personal lives but we hear we're here to continue to finish up with the business that we will have worked on here for 40 working days and I would ask you to do that. I would like to support this a German resolution that gives us some certainty to our lives and again I would like to speak to Raulston for his support and his directional helping negotiate this schedule and certainly appreciate the Senate and then working with us. With that in a speaker I will answer any questions I probably went into too much in depth this but I want to commend you Mr. Leader. I think some of you have been here for a little while can remember when we would do an adjournment resolution about a week at a time two weeks at a time I don't ever recall one being done in January that took us till the end in April that gives members the ability to plan and I think that's important but it also sets aside enough time for us to get our work done. I want to commend you very much for your work on this. You've got a couple of questions if you care to yield. How you respect chair recognizes representative Al Williams to your left for a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker of the gentleman yield. From my friend the red light was about to go on. I know that in your infinite wisdom Mr. Leader you and the speaker in your negotiations did not realize you knew there was some important days but on the fourth of April. On the fourth of April that's the 41st win anniversary of Isaiah Hughley and Carol Hughley how could you. 41 years and I'm sure on that great day of celebration with all the friends and family they did not get on to a lot of things till after midnight so. Thank you representative representative Williams if it makes you and representative Hughley feel better there's another one going to be here on his anniversary. I'm not naming names I'm not naming names we're going to be working. I just I may be needing a place to stay for somebody after it's over. You're for another question one more miss speaker chair recognizes representative dooks to your left for a question. Thank you for giving us an opportunity to plan our lives around the schedule that that that is very helpful. One of the concerns is the lightness of when we are getting out and I guess for my question is that it must have escaped me but did we not pass legislation last year. What groups are allowed to collect funds while we're in session we pay us something they gave a certain group of people and opportunity to collect money. I've been here for a minute. I'm going to get you a copy of that bill of the future. It's kind of late for a constitutional year that's so thank you leader to my friends from South West Georgia yes sir that is the case and we will present my I'll make sure that you and I sit down and go for that legislation. And I think this I'll close with this comment I believe very sincerely that we were all sent here I know I was sent here to do a job. And we want to do that job with adequate consideration of every everything that we take up. I know that both sides of the aisles committed to that and I appreciate working with with leader Beverly and all the leadership on that side and our leadership as well as the admonition and I'm going to do my best to help smooth out the April 1st celebrations that make sure they that. Our first lady understands that the speaker's priority is here to get things to work and we're going to take care of that and I'm sure she understands that. She never would have gone along with that agreement but with that I'll ask for y'all's table consideration on SR 382 thank you. Clark agreed to caption to SR 382. A resolution relative meetings in the Germans the general assembly and for other purposes.
