TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good morning, good morning, it's 8.10 so we're going to go ahead and get started apologize for the delay, but we wanted to be sensitive to the fact that some people are having a slightly harder time getting into the Capitol this morning.
Welcome to the Senator Preparations Committee meeting, March 27th, 2025.
We have one bill on the agenda.
It's House Bill 68, and before we get started, Senator Harverson, would you mind leading
us in an invocation?
Yes, sir.
Father God, thank you for allowing us to see another day.
us to be mindful of who is always in charge here in the capital as well as in the world.
Thank you for your blessings, give us safe travel, go on and come in these things we ask
in Jesus name. Amen. Thank you. House Bill 68 has already been placed in your folders
and it's on most of your desks, 238 pages that will lay out how the state will spend approximately
$36, $37 billion over the next 12 months. A taxpayer dollars that we ourselves sell nothing
to create. They are created by our citizens and the economic activity that they create
through jobs, creation of businesses and industries across our state.
And we're blessed to be in this position to help reallocate some of those funds.
Terriers that we hope are worthy of that effort.
The budget process is not simple, it's not easy, and you know a lot of people are involved.
First need to say thank you to a few of them.
I appreciate Director Don and Governor Kemp for their efforts this year working with us
even back into October as we started planning for this budget, they asked for agency requests
back at that period of time, allowed us to have a little bit of insight into those.
And then prepared their budget they brought forward to us.
As you know, Chairman Hatchett in the House, Speaker Burns, who's the carrier of this bill,
then picked that, those recommendations up, turned them into what you see here, House
Bill 68.
And Chairman Hatchett, there's a few better to work with.
I've had the blessing of working with two extremely talented, extremely kind, extremely
caring House Chairman, Chairman Terry England, who we're all still thinking of, Prime
4, and Chairman Matt Hatchett.
And they make my job a lot easier, I'm glad for them.
The, I'm glad to be able to work with them.
The other group that's so extremely important to this task is our Senate budget, all
was headed by Brent Churchill, Austin Trot, and the analysts who are sitting on the front
row there. Without them, there is absolutely no way we would have been at this process.
Now, this budget has been interesting for a variety of reasons that we'll probably
talk about, and they have risen to the challenge once again in both the amended and the general
budgets, and I am so thankful to work with a team that is so talented, so young, so experienced,
willing to give effort whether it be at 1 a.m. in the morning or 1 p.m. in the
afternoon. I thank you very much for everything you've done to help us get
here today.
You don't have to read too many headlines to see that the National Outlook is
sometimes scary. Markets are not what they have been in the past. You can
usually predict when folks run the bonds. That means one thing. If they run the
gold, it means something, if they run the stock market, it means a third thing potentially.
But right now in the current economy, that's not necessarily, you can't watch what folks
have done in the past and predict where we're going to be in the future.
What I can tell you is that in 2019, we were cutting budgets in 2020 when Chairman
Jekyll passed away, we were in a reduction mentality, we thought we were going to have
to reduce funds.
When we, that changed though after COVID, we had taken 15% out of the budget, you
started there and ended up at 9.5% coming out and then federal spending just
changed the entire game. The federal sugar high though now five years later is
clearly over and we're back to the levels we were in 2019. That's not to say
that that's the blame of any individual or any person or any entity. It's
simply a realization that all COVID and its COVID federal spending did was
It's a lady inevitable for roughly five to six years.
Where we stand now, after we've seen double-digit increases in state revenues over the past
a few years, is that we're not at that double-digit level anymore.
In fact, you've seen, if we look at this year, we're about 1% 1.8% at times revenue increase
over the previous year, and that means things are leveling out.
They're flattening.
The sugar high is ending.
We've also seen a string cost increase, whether those cost being labor, those cost being
goods and inputs.
And what we've also seen on a national level is an extreme desire by the federal government
to get its fiscal house in order, a re-alignment of federal funds that's much needed and
I fully support, and it will impact us.
In contrast, you have what we've done here in Georgia for years.
We've had a balanced budget.
We've been in the low 40s, 40s, 50 states.
We've been 40 or below in per capita spending
and per capita taxation for quite a period of time.
That's even after a surge at the local level
that we've seen on taxation due to inflation
and folks from the north to side
and that the southern climate and the southern way of life
has been something that they'd like to experience
a little bit more.
We've also been able to continue during this time
return billions to taxpayers, while also continuing to return billions to taxpayers, we've
been able to lower the tax rate, 6 tenths of a percent at this point in time, which is
roughly $2.4 billion that you will not see recognized in this budget that you would
have had we not begun reducing the income tax several years ago. On top of that, you
have a commitment to do that again this year. So I think we're standing in great contrast
budget wise to where our friends at the federal level have met. We also need to
realize though that the federal government didn't get there overnight. They
borrowed a lot of money. They deficit spent many times. They funded some things
that people might call half-baked ideas. But bigger than that I think what they
did is they refused to say no. And sometimes in the budget process the hardest
thing to do, but the most responsible thing to do is you simply have to say no.
They didn't push back on its fences, and that's why I ended up in the position that they were over many, many decades.
We're not going to do that here at the state level.
The Senate's budget that you see before you today,
currently funds our priorities.
It funds the needs of our state without issuing more debt,
even the traditional debt that we've issued in the past.
And we reject the urge to supplant federal funding
funding from the COVID era programs like Esther and Arpa that are aspiring this year.
We also hold true to funding formulas, whether that means growth or that means reductions,
and the Senate's budget eliminates some programs.
It slows the growth of positions, it questions invoices that are brought to us while they may
be good ideas.
Sometimes we think that they lack some portion of explanation and we made the lay those
for a period of time.
The Senate's budget also prepares for its expenses based on bills we've already passed
in our assembly this year.
And I think for the group that was meeting subcommittee chairs that had to really comb
through this and work in detail for hours and hours on end, I think that might have been
their biggest takeaway.
Every bill we pass, almost every bill we pass, has some fiscal impact.
And we have to decide if we want that impact to the fiscal stability of our state matters
enough to allow it to go across the General Assembly's floor.
Our budget takes and highlights in several areas those bills as they pass and calls out
the spending that was placed in to support the bills that we passed previously.
It's not saying that those bills were a bad idea.
It's not saying that the spending is a bad idea.
We're simply trying to call to point and remind us that everything we do here has a cost
and that someone else is normally paying the bill.
The budget is laid out in areas that starts with the judicial branch, as you know, it
goes to the legislative branch next and then it goes to the executive branch.
Actually, it starts with the legislative branch, goes to the court, something goes to the
executive branch.
And I'm going to explain it and run through it that way too.
When we get to the executive branch, it'll be alphabetical.
It's not by how we favoritize different agencies.
It's just alphabetical.
So I'm going to run through it starting now,
give you a little idea of what's up.
You can see the legislative budget.
There's not a whole lot of ads there,
mostly for legislative services, very low dollars,
and you can read through those.
At the courts, you're going to see a few more increases.
The Senate's proposal begins all positions
and all raises on January 1st.
It eliminates some laudable, but not yet started initiatives.
And it takes and acknowledges the retention needs
in the prosecuting attorney's council.
But it also takes the start of those retention programs
to January 1st.
We also remain true to the formulas, as I mentioned already,
for public defenders and prosecuting attorneys,
and that formula funds one prosecuting attorney,
and one public defender per superior court judges and circuits.
also funds at Chief ADA and of course the DA.
One of the more proud items that I have is actually the juvenile courts.
You know for the past two or three years we've worked with them on a program to try to
get some data to help us understand our foster care program and ending termination of parental
rights when we needed those children to be able to be adopted in a more expedient fashion.
The juvenile courts have worked with us well.
We asked for data, our Senate budget analyst, Jennifer made this one of her top priorities.
It's going to call it a pet project, but it's really more a top priority.
And because we got responses from every single juvenile court, we have not recommended a reduction
in the juvenile court grants this year.
Moving to the first executive department, which will be Ag, we acknowledge that there's
significant concern to our state's poultry industry and we tried to fund the
concerns there. There was a request for planning for future lab. We took the
house's proposal, studied it in detail. We want to support that initiative as well,
but we want to study it a little bit further. So instead of putting the
planning and design money in, we've included money instead for planning to
make sure we understand exactly what's going to happen with both the capital
Hill Complex and with a state lab needed for agriculture, we support it.
I want to make sure we just understand that plan first.
We did continue to fund the plans that relate to the Capitol Hill
and for state farmers' market changes.
We had an interesting proposal concerning Farrell Hoggs.
That's a huge problem for Ag.
My analyst are laughing because we brought it up.
They thought about it.
You know our proposal the proposal brought to us was pins those pins cost about $14,000 each and
You know how pins work with feral hogs if you live anywhere outside the metro region
The proposal was was relatively expensive about half a million dollars
What we came up with with our subcommittee chairs and others was perhaps a different type of program that would
basically incentivized hunters in these areas to create a program to go after
that for one fifth of the cost. So again something that I'm glad we were able to
think up we want to solve that problem and hopefully we can solve it with less
state dollars being used. At the Department of Behavioral Health we have
focused our state resources here for many many years you've seen a 25% increase
I believe in the past five years on spending on mental health resources in our
state. The Senate's budget increases the now-comp waivers by 200 and then it
annualized the funding for another 100-comp waivers. It provides funding for
the Making Stabilization Center. We fund one quarter of the Fulton Behavioral
Crisis Center, one quarter because it's believed to be starting up in Spring
of next year. That's not a slight to them at all. It's just we don't need to fund
that. Start-up cost if we only think it's going to make it through a quarter of
the fiscal year. And we continue to focus on forensic beds. We know we have a
backlog there, we want to work through that before it becomes more of a crisis situation.
The Senate's budget eliminated a contract with a vendor who left state medical providers
holding the bag for about $2.7 million.
We also receded on funding for certain other initiatives that may have been started and
we think they're good ideas but at this point in time they need a little bit further analysis.
We held the house number for the increases in the Georgia Housing Voucher Program and
continued the Senate's priority for all-tism treatment care and support. In the
DBA HDD budget we did say no to many worthy endeavors but we're not no
forever on those endeavors. We just want to make sure that we continue to
study those and see how the fiscal health of the state continues over the
next few years. In the Department of Community Affairs there were areas where
providers were unable to provide some receipts for previous expenditures and
so we zeroed out the future funding for those measures.
We supported the city of Albany's efforts
to continue to support its history
and support childhood learning
in its plan for its revitalization downtown.
We supported the plans of the House and the Governor
to reduce the number of programs
that are in the Department of Community Affairs
and to consolidate others for better resource provisions
to our citizens.
We also reduced the funds at two of our largest state
economic development programs being one Georgia and REBA.
Those have been plused up over the years
by different legislative ads since we're now at a point
that we need to begin re-assessing our spending ourselves.
We pull some of those legislative ads
to return those back to base number figures.
At the Department of Community Health rather,
we did support the house increase on provider rates
for primary care and dental care codes,
but we did it at half the amount that the house had added.
We supported the ABA therapy rate increase at 3% and we supported the full increase for
neonatologist and maternal fetal medicine rate increases.
We did not support the rate increases for ventilators, speech, or durable medical equipment.
At EMS, we supported a 5% rate increase for 7 EMS codes and we funded the increase
to begin transportation reimbursement at mile six.
The Board of Dentistry, interesting things that we came into as we dove into that matter.
There's some new leadership over there and we actually have some concerns related to
safety at the Department of the Board of Dentistry and we are going to address those with
funding slightly less than the house's level but we are going to have to provide some things
including protective equipment, security equipment at the Board of Dentistry.
The Senate's budget also funds two additional federally qualified health centers and we support
sickle cell research at a mountain lesser than the then the house did, but we recognize
over 28 million in base spending on sickle cell help and resources to support the treatment
of this disease.
The Senate supports $1 million addition for PTSD and wraparound services related to
Georgia's veterans and supporting their families.
We continued the governors, the House and the Senate's practice of moving skilled nursing
facilities forwarded on their audited cost reports.
And I think that's something that we're very proud that we've been able to do for the
past few years, and it's important that we continue to do that so that that number does
not become instrumentable in future years.
For pharmacy matters, the Senate agreed with the House and held $3.1 million to support
our independent pharmacies in the State Health Benefit Plan.
We also added an additional $5 million by moving about $3.5 million out of U.S.G.
over two DCHs combining it with $1.2 million that the House had already added for $5 million
reimbursement for drugs, dispensed to persons for self-administration in an amount equal
to the national average drug acquisition cost that most people refer to as the NADAC.
The Senate's budget includes and supports 150 new residency spots, and it instructs the
Department of Community Health to file a state plan amendment for the use of Medicaid reimbursements
to maximize Georgia dollars in graduate medical education, similar to what's being done
in the state of Florida and we understand when Florida filed for their state plan amendment
that was approved very quickly in about 60 days.
The Department of Corrections, remember that we met on the Department of Corrections
and their budget before the governor ever gave us his proposal this year.
And that was with his help.
He gave us the Department of Corrections numbers earlier, early commissioner Oliver has been
very transparent to let us know that he has an issue with staff and retention there and
needs some significant resources to even manage the locks.
Our body has also been focused on technology related to contraband entering the facilities.
And we've been focused on contraband banning contraband and making sure that cell phones
did not work inside those facilities.
The governor's budget had an increase of roughly 125 million in base budget items for
the Department of Corrections.
The House's proposal carried that number up to roughly 250 million over the base number
for corrections, and the Senate's number falls somewhere in between.
We didn't take all of the house ads, we're slightly higher than the governor, and we end
up with roughly $170 million in additional base funding for the Department of Corrections
to address retention, to address staffing, to address security related to locks and gates,
and to address technology moving forward in the future.
the Department of Driver Services, the Senate acknowledged the use of technology by the
Department and supported that use by requesting evidence that that use is allowed them to
reduce their need for additional personnel in the future.
At the Georgia decal, the Department of Early Child Learning, we support the Governor and
House's recommendation for 500 additional caps funded slots.
Remember, we've now maxed out the federal funds in caps,
so we're completely on state funds for this measure,
and we serve about 50,000 children statewide
through that program.
We continue to fund our pre-key programs,
and we agree with the House and the Governor
for $14 million to continue the phased-in reduction
of class sizes from 20 to 22.
At the Department of Economic Development,
we recognize base funding,
instead of increasing funds at the Martin Luther King Center.
We have base funds there, I believe,
of 250,000 or 500,000.
It's written on the line, I apologize,
I don't remember right now.
And we delayed support for Super Bowl 62
and the 2031 NCAA, NCAA Final Four
for the same reasons that we stated in the amended budget.
One events, three years away, one event, six years away.
We do support those programs
and want to make sure that we provide
necessary security there. I want some more explanation about the infrastructure
requested. But again, if we're going to fund those programs, we believe the
state should keep the interest on those dollars rather than paying those out
and allowing those dollars to be the interest to be kept at other entities.
In the Department of Education, we continue to fully fund the QB teaching
formula. We did reduce funding again for testing and ask that those
numbers could be true up in the amended budget if more PSAT or other AP tests are given.
And we took reductions based on utilization in various different categories. We increased
funds for character education. And we funded a Senate bill that passed last year concerning
school supplies, but did it at a different figure than had previously been discussed with
the House. The House have funded the measure. We believe that the best way to engage communities
in their schools is to have seed funding from the state that would fund this program at
a 25% level and allow for matching funds either from the local, the LEA, the local education
agency, or from civic organizations in the same community.
literacy. This has been an initiative of the Senator from the 4th and really the
Senate as a whole for many years and we appreciate Speaker Burns and Miss
Del Burns and their focus on this area too. We've probably made the so much
progress because of their involvement. I'm not sure we would have been nearly as
far down this road had the Senator from the 4th and the Speaker and Miss Del
not been so focused. There's someone else who deserves a lot of credit for that
And that's another one of our Senate budget analysts, Lindsay, who made this one of her
top priorities to tackle.
The Senate's budget agrees with all of the House dollars added in literacy.
We do not change a single dollar.
We do not reduce a single dollar.
We do not true up a single dollar.
We agree and support the House's ads as it relates to literacy fully.
In student services, we did have some differences though.
There was a house initiative related to student mental health.
The Senate's not yet ready based on bills that are currently pending here to fund a database
program there.
We zeroed that out, but it's not, we also zeroed out some funding that you'll see in student
services related to mental health, but it's not as zero as a whole.
What you will actually see is we took that funding, we combined part of it with the program
funding we already have for school mental based health health services in the
Apex program move those out of DBHD and move them all over to the school
security program because we do think that mental health is part of school
security. We chose not to support the $28 million house targeted ad for
economically disadvantaged support programs and choosing instead to
recognize the over $1.5 billion in base funding support for this effort.
We did support and increased funds for about $12.5 million total for out of school care.
And in the Senate's biggest budget move, we fully supported and fully funded the promised
scholarship at 1% of QBE, which is $141 million.
will allow for 21,000 students and their families to have options to pick other schools when
the school that they're attending falls in the bottom quartile of schools otherwise in
the state.
An employee's retirement system, the house had a line for about $23 million for state employees
and state retirees rather, and payments to them, then it's been a lot of discussion
I know about coalists in this building for a while.
The Senate Committee increased this amount to almost $76 million for annual payments to
state retirees to help with record high inflation.
They've experienced over the past half decade and to improve the funded ratio, which is
necessary if they're ever going to be able to restart that COLA program again.
At the Department of Human Services, I really want to highlight an efficiency here.
For many, many years, we had added money's millions of dollars year over year to a contract
that we had with a Georgia based company
to verify labor and wage data.
Last year, we had an employee in the Department
of Human Services come to us and say,
I think we can do this better.
This contract continues to increase.
I think I can write a program that would allow us to simply
bid out to a lowest cost essentially like a reverse auction
to verify labor and wage data because of the success
of that program and the reduction in federal fines
that we were assessed when that previous company got it wrong,
we're going to be able to reduce the department
of human services budget by a little over $2 million.
At GBI, you'll see that the state will continue
to fund the making improvements.
We will continue to fund lab equipment
and based on an innovative approach
by the subcommittee chair over that area,
We're going to purchase five portable mass spectrometers
to assist in getting quicker results for ADAs
and other departments related to drug proving
that certain drugs are the drugs they said they were,
which we believe will help us also move faster
and get more efficiencies in our criminal justice system.
The Senate budget also includes $100,000
for the cold case unit.
It's reduction from the house, but it's an increase to the base fund.
As CJCC, the criminal justice coordinator in council, we did not replace the loss of federal
funds, but we did acknowledge anticipated federal funds for core services for victims
of crimes, which allows us to pull back on some of the increases you may have seen in the
house budget for a state funding there.
We're going to promote efficient season this item as well, and this agency, we believe
that the 24-hour human trafficking hotline can be done with resources that the G-SAC,
which would allow us to continue that 24-7 hotline without needing to increase additional
state funds.
At the Department of juvenile justice, we're really proud of the commissioner and the
work she's done here.
We want to support her work and we'll fund a 4% salary increase, almost across the
board in that agency, with 8% increases in certain fields that we see the potential
for a lot higher turnover.
At the Department of Labor, we pause some spending there just to give the Commissioner
time to prepare her plan moving forward.
At the Department of Law, we pull back slightly on the number of positions, but it remains
supportive of the gang prosecution units and it's spent some human trafficking units into
Augusta and into Macon.
We transferred $50,000 out of the Department of Law over to the Judicial Council based
on testimony by the Judicial Council that the Department of Law may not have been able
to represent them based on conflicts with the branches of government and the Department
of Natural Resources.
We left $1 million for beach restoration, pulled the remaining three.
We funded $349,000 for a matter related to offshore reef fishing and complications there
with federal surveys that are really beginning to impact commercial fishing and tourism in
that area.
at the Environmental Protection Division,
we streamline the contracting process
and allow the state to save another $581,000 there.
We pull back increases for the venison processing
and chronic waste disease programs.
We think both are important,
but they have base funding
and we recognize that base funding in both of those items.
At the Department of Public Health,
we removed funds and eliminated the Georgia Coordinating
Council that was roughly $3 million.
Remember it was something we stood up during COVID.
We've now pulled out the base funds and ended that program.
We transferred duties that may have been assigned to that council elsewhere.
And we took the opportunity to help reduce cost in the future by funding something related
to viral hepatitis.
If we can treat, catch and treat that disease early, the cost savings is immense.
If we do not catch that disease early, then you're obviously looking or likely looking
at a liver transplant.
many of those liver transplants end up being funded through our Medicaid program.
We want to catch that early and see if we can prevent those calls to the future.
At the Department of Public Safety, we continue to be careful on additional staff, and we recognize
payments from the Chiefs of Police and Sheriff's in the amended budget rather than adding them
to base budgets, and we're committed to continuing that for transparency purposes in the future.
We supported the retention plan at the Public Service Commission, and in the Board of Regents
budget we reduced funds for the Georgia Cyber Center to continue to allow it to
stand on its own as it was designed to do so with rent proceeds. We did not
support the addition of the microgrants program but we did support the
technology research additions into the peanut industry. We kept the house cut
to the public law schools but we returned the base funding for the legal
clinics also at those law schools and we were decreased base funding in various
programs that had been begun in previous cycles, past cycles by the General Assembly, and
as time's going on, we wondered if those still needed to be continued and we reduced several
of them. We reduced expenditures to projections for the
Forest Land Protection Grant Program at the Department of Revenue. The Department of Revenue
still believes it's going to be completely fine for funding this program. Just you've seen
in the past that the grants have decreased,
less qualified, less counties qualified
or qualified at lesser amounts,
so we pulled back some base funding there.
At the Secretary of State's office,
we did provide $600,000 to fund the State Elections Board,
and we added language to certain boards
that are attached to the Secretary of State,
related to their rent to help encourage them
and push them forward on seeking rent at reduced rates.
The Department of Transportation, we continue to do
utilization of the motor fuel for most construction
and maintenance matters.
And we held the House Edition for Airport 8.
We also had one request that we did fund $2 million
requested by members of this body for transportation
improvements at the Combo and CID area.
In veterans, we added $3.5 million
from various veterans to related care items.
and we're extremely excited about the sub-acute carrying unit coming online very soon.
In capital projects, usually what we would see on state bonds, we did not fund those with bonds,
we funded those with cash moving closer to the governor's proposal on capital projects.
We disagreed with the House on that bond plan overall and again I told you
and opting instead to fund these with cash.
And we also delayed some capital projects for savings
that we thought would be better funded elsewhere.
That one of those capital projects was at AG.
Another one was at the Department of Geoval Justice.
When you flip through the budget,
you know the capital projects right at the end.
You're not gonna see very many ads for the house or the Senate.
And I think that's something that the legislature overall
needs to become more accustomed to.
As you see that 1% to 1.8% growth line in the future,
and you've seen, and we've talked about the additions
that you're gonna need for corrections,
the none as we put there this year are annualized now,
but they're probably looking at additional annualized funds
in the future.
I think you're gonna see our capital,
its expenditures continue to get smaller.
Of those ads, one of them that you will see
is an added funding for design at Augusta Tech.
And we funded the UNG project with alternate fund sources.
The Senate's budget did one thing slightly different this year.
It's only informational.
Many times we hear comparisons of our state to others related to the state income tax.
And that's very, very, very comparison.
And the question you get from any constituents is, hey, why can Florida or Texas or Tennessee
eliminate the state income tax in Georgia can't. Well Georgia can. And if you look on the
first page of your budget after the green sheets, the Senate budget office helped me compile
a list of tax credits and tax exemptions that we already pay for at our state. And if
If you add those up, that is more than we collect in our state income tax.
I'm not suggesting as a policy that we should eliminate all these, but I am telling you,
every time we pass another one, we make it harder to eliminate the state income tax.
Further, if you look at some of these items, they're big, big numbers.
The first one is 12.2 billion.
For purposes of understanding only, please know that we collect roughly 16 billion total
in individual income tax.
So sales and use taxes exemptions, we do not tax services.
That's a policy decision of our state, and I'm not suggesting we move otherwise, but
think about it.
We don't tax it when the plumber comes to your house, when the person's fixing your car,
when the person's building your house, you don't get a sales tax bill for their labor.
In Texas, you do 6.25%.
If Georgia wants to move in that direction instead, we can eliminate our state income tax.
But we're going to have to look at how Texas makes that up.
And I wanted to provide for you this graph to show you exemptions that Georgia has that
certain ones of our other states may be surrounding states may be do not.
The total of that list there well eclipses the amount of
monies that we bring in in state income tax.
So that's just there for information purposes in case we
want to continue this discussion and move it forward
later on.
In closing, I need to tell you thank you so much.
This is the sixth year you've allowed me to cheer the budget
on your behalf.
11th budget that you've allowed me to help write for our state.
And it is truly an honor.
never gets easier, but because of your input, your involvement, and your constant support,
it's a bearable task, and the Senate budget office staff are incredibly, incredibly
adept at helping answer your questions and help you do the best job you can to represent
your districts individually and then our state and its fiscal health overall.
So thank you for allowing me to do this again this year, and I'm happy to take any questions
you may have. Senator Karpacic. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I wanted to personally thank you
for your support of the data project for the juvenile courts. And I'm very happy that
the juvenile court clerks have responded. I understand there are still some issues
with some of the counties where the Superior Court clerks do the reporting and I wondered
if you could address that. Yes, ma'am. There are. You're correct.
We did get responses from every court.
So some of those came in via jump drive.
There is a portal that the General Assembly,
your body has already funded that allows
for a digital submission of all that data.
It's able to be submitted with redacted information
so we don't have a scare of personal information
getting out.
The jump drives are not safe as that on that.
So if there are any clerks listening,
I hope you'll please take a look at the J-Cats program
that we are funding for you at the state level.
We have had a little, a small issue with superior court clerks
being a little bit slower to update to the process,
but we're again, so thankful that the president
of the Superior Court clerks council this year,
and the new management that you have
at the Superior Court clerks council
has been extremely willing to discuss
that issue with us and move it forward.
Yes, ma'am.
The Dean of the Senate, Senator Harbson.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
You mentioned something about cell phones
at the Department of Corrections and the staffing issues.
We look at it ways to get that up.
Of course, as we heard in the committee hearings,
it's pretty darned and want to get up
and it's a safety issue for the law enforcement people
there in that kind of way.
And secondly, have we determined, is that in legal way,
We can ban the cell phones or is that legal or how does that work because we've heard that before that you couldn't do it so right we are working on that with our federal partners we are not allowed to completely jam everything in that area which I think is what you and I would prefer to take take care of the problem from the beginning chairman albers has been instrumental in going through every not just line item but every invoice related to that.
to those items you discussed and without his help I'm not sure that we could have
finished this part of the budget and there's an expedited version that we did.
Well, I'm sure we can't keep looking at that because I just got the impression that
that's a real serious problem that we can we need to look at. And thank you
for the 28 million by sickle cell. I just always look at that.
base funding. Right. Okay. All right. Great. Great. Thanks. Thanks. Fun. You're not a majority of that
is in Medicaid care. As Chairman Harrison brought up, I want this body to remember you're going to
be required to put additional dollars into corrections next year. So be thinking about that as you
move forward and think about your request as you're back in your district after session. Chairman
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I just want to make a comment.
The last few years I've been able to be a subcommittee chair and I just want to thank you for all your hard work and your staff, Caroline Hicks did a great job as my analyst.
Your analysts are really good and your team's very good and I just want to say thank you and it's been an honor to serve as one of your subcommittee chairs and I know we all had to take tough cuts.
I mean, I was talking to the senator from the 56.
I had to take tough cuts in economic development.
I don't think there's a department that didn't have to take
a little bit of a haircut, but you did it in the right way.
And I just want to say thank you, you've done a great job.
Thank you, any credit for the staff, though.
It doesn't need to go to me.
Any is good at Austin and to Brent.
They do the hiring and management.
And I'll tell you, those analysts also, I say those analysts,
they're sitting right there.
They are so independent and their ability to grasp
on to an issue and move forward.
You can't teach that.
They're just an extremely impressive route.
Chairman Walker.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I want to echo what Senator Beach is saying.
I had the opportunity to sit with you several hours
through this process.
And I have in years past, thankfully,
been able to be part of the process.
And I'm consistently impressed with your knowledge
of the budget and your wisdom and your compassion
and your thoughtfulness and the way you approach this
and your willingness to take input from all the senators
and try to do your best to address their priorities.
And I just can't thank you enough.
And again, your staff's just really, really incredible
and super helpful.
I appreciate you highlighting in your overview line 100.4,
which deals with drug dispensing costs.
We're adding $5 million.
This issue of fairness with independent pharmacies
versus chain pharmacies and PBMs is something
the Senate has grappled with for years.
It's a priority of the Lieutenant Governor
and a priority of the Senate to get this right.
We've got a bill on the floor today, House Bill 196
that we need to pass clean that is going to, I think,
fairly address this issue.
I wanted to point out to the members
that the $5 million is, a lot of that
is initial cost in setting up this program.
We do anticipate some savings in the future,
because this will put a ceiling on the,
we're using the Nadak pricing formula.
and we think we're gonna have some savings
because we're putting a ceiling on the cost
of prescription drugs that we'll have a floor
and a ceiling and it will restore fairness
for our independent pharmacies.
And I thank you for your leadership on this.
Thank you, Chairman Walker.
You're right, that $5 million is only 1.2 million
additional state funds.
We pulled 3.8 million out of the USG program
of savings we expect we'll have in pharmacies there.
I'll tell you all these kind of words.
I checked my pulse for a second.
I don't know if I was out of my eulogy or not.
Senator Williams walks in here in a second,
I'm gonna get scared.
Chairman Albers.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I wanna add to the compliments,
specifically around the not taking a bond package out.
At a time where we've got extraordinary reserves
that are undesignated as well as already day fund,
the great budgeting that's happened
from the governor of the Senate and the House.
I wanna applaud you and the committee's work on
saying we're not going to take out bonds when we have this type of funds available and
being good fiscal conservators.
I think it's a great posture as we continue to demonstrate to other states what can be
done while they're reeling with record deficits.
So, well done.
Well, with Robertson, Mr. Chairman, first of all, I want to say I'm glad you were able
to absorb all those compliments and the good words and we'll try to get it back on track
over hand. I did I did see in here where there's a I think it's a little less than a million
dollar appropriation for a new tower and equipment associated with that for I believe
is it Georgia public broadcasting that's in there. It's in the bond package. It's in the
bond package right and it's not the bond package. The capital projects that normally would
be bonds that we're funding with cash, correct?
Yes, sir.
Can I ask you a question?
What's the overall investment we're making
into Georgia for broadcasting in this budget?
Oh, man, why'd you ask me that one?
And the question was, you were loving all the love so much.
You'd have to go to the border regions.
Yes, sir.
In border regions budget, you'd go to public broadcasting.
Let's see here.
I need to get one of my animals saying I can go to the next question while they're
looking.
Right before the partner revenue. Sorry. Let me go to my line on that 307. I'm a 301. I haven't gone quite far enough yet.
My mortality is showing
13.2 million dollars. Thank you. And
Of the QBE fully funded. First of all, I want to thank you for that. And is is any of that?
Did the study committee change any of that formula put to this point or were continuing to work under the way we have been?
years passed. We would not change anything with that formula. We did change things related
to the non-QBE formulas. Yes, sir. Well, and finally, very uncareistically. I want
to thank you so much for all the work you've done with the Georgia Department of Corrections.
I understand that even though it doesn't seem like that, we're working with limited funding
to take care of something that I think has been neglected for many years and I appreciate
how aggressive and how forthright you've been throughout this process to make sure those
problems could be solved and while I appreciate the 4% I do look forward in years
forward that that we can continue to increase the environment that our
state employees work in in our prisons and also increase the pay and benefits
that they receive for doing a job that 99% of Georgians would never want to do
and thank you so much for that. Well thank you again and you and Chairman
Albers for what you did in the all session to help set this up again I think we
We have a mission that we have to make sure we're promoting the safety of our employees,
of those who are in our custody, and also the public at large.
Chairman, kind of a talk today.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Great job.
I move for a previous question on House Bill 68.
There's been a motion, is there a second?
Second, any further discussion?
All those in favor, please say aye.
Opposed, no.
And it passed unanimously.
Thank you so much.
We stand adjourned.
You
