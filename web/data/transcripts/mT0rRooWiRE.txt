----------
of finance to order. This is certainly our plan to be the last meeting of the year,
and I'll go and do the invocation today myself. Our dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for
all that you've blessed us with, all you've given us.
You've been so good to us in so many ways.
And we thank you for giving us opportunities we have
in the place we live in and the things that have been provided.
We ask that this committee and all of us here
would have wisdom to do the thing that you would provide us
with the ability to do those things
and that we would listen to you in all matters.
We ask this all in your name and for your sake, I'm in.
So we're gonna look back at House Bill 86,
the bill that had the Aquarium and Zoo
and something else in it.
It actually never left out of the committee
and got reported out.
So it's still in our committee.
And to revisit, I will need a motion to reconsider this.
to reconsider this got a motion second to reconsider it any discussion I'll
in favor say aye any opposed so you have in your folder LC 45 28 48 S which has
something much sure we've got everything in there I'm not sure that the the
The sunset get back in, that may be the one thing that wasn't in the original.
I believe it is, if you're looking at 24, 28, 48 us, the sunset is on the line.
I see it now in line 60, just want to make sure they slip by me a couple of times in past
years.
I make a motion to pass the Burberry Times, Jim.
All right.
We've got a motion that I accept to do pass this is there a second, second by Senator
of it all in favor say aye.
Aye.
Any opposed?
There's none and I believe that Senator Ambers, you were the, I'm sorry, Senator.
Okay.
All right.
We've got one no vote from the committee and the motion passes with one name.
Chairman Black, when you want to come up to the committee here and there's a lot in
that bill for you to explain to the committee here.
We had a hearing last week and I think our fiscal note is in here, isn't it?
This is my fourth meeting in a row from higher ed to rules to health, and I left health
early, so I haven't had much time to go over the packet, but I've got good people working
that hopefully I have everything ready for it.
So you'll see a fiscal note in there on this bill, and we'll go with that in a little
bit, but if you want to present first to the committee.
Sure, Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.
Bring before you house bill 454.
LC4-3276-9S, I believe.
Is that what you have, Mr. Chairman?
No, and did he get a copy of the new one?
I apologize for that.
I meant to do that right when I came in.
Okay.
Sure.
Did you find those glasses here in this room?
I did, I had so many people tell me
They make me look like I have a little bit of sense.
So I was walking around looking, you know, dumbfounded and ignorant, I probably still do,
but maybe this helps just a little bit there.
I left them here, I was, you know, practicing it.
So section seven, there's a couple of sections in the New Language Brother and that it should
be exactly what you had with the exception of the force,
was your definition has been modified slightly.
We've been continuing to work it on that one to see what will work.
So if you want to start on the bill.
Yes, sir.
I will do my best here.
section one is as it relates to the IRC update and essentially perpetuates the ability
for manufacturers to expense certain things in a full year versus over a five year period
as was adjusted at the federal level in the original IRC update.
So that's why that looks as it does.
Two through five are some technical changes and some adjustments based on some feedback
that we received from economists and accountants and other members regarding 1437 last year.
There were some realized I think revenue adjustments to the state allowed us to get the standard
deduction in place for married,
filing joint families a little earlier,
so save them a considerable amount of money
starting in year one.
I do have some, you know,
I can dive a little bit further into this
if you'd like me to answer as many questions as you like
and as far into the weeds as you'd like, Mr. Chairman,
but ultimately it takes a $300 per taxpayer credit,
so that's 600 for married in order to make sure
that we keep everybody whole and saving money
in a very difficult environment that we have.
I would also say, I see the final part,
I think with regard to the forced measure,
was updated so that national disaster
would also capture what we have seen in the last three years,
which is a pandemic.
And is that where the adjustment
that you're referring to, Mr. Chairman is?
And that was, that was work with the Ledge Council on and the Department of
Revenue to make sure we felt like we had language that that did what was the
intent of it today was best we could though we can't go retrospective and we
can't be gratuitous it seemed to be the best language we could do I see us you
you know, section seven.
Yes.
Seven and eight is the addition that you don't have to give any explanation on.
But let's go over, let me summarize a little bit for the committee because I know we've
had a little bit of talk on this, but we already had a bill last year that would have some
rate reductions of a tenth of a percent, eventually down to 4.99, only if certain triggers
were met. We didn't want to put something in that handy-campus state if the revenue
wasn't there. So in your bill, there's a look back on what we look at to see if the
triggers are there, and really the administration sets the revenue so that they've got a lot
control on this but you're changing the five-year look back to a three-year look
back in this correct. Yes, Mr. Chairman and I'll kind of if you'll allow me
maybe explain a little bit of how that that worked. There was some I guess
part in part of the clarification with regards to that reduction as you can see
on page five where we struck the original language that there was some question as to whether
or not you might skip rate reduction and it go directly to a two-tenths or a three-tenths
or a four-tenths.
So as part of an offset that, you know, the look back instead of a five-year look back
would be a three-year look back.
And you know, that was a Senate provision that we had in there, good one, I'm sure.
And I thought that if there was some concern or needed to be some adjustments that that
could be made on the all side of the house, sir, of the building, I should say.
And then you have changed, which changed to back to where I actually wanted to be last
year, but we're going from personal exemption amounts to new standard deduction amounts.
the standard deductions had been on a phase in to try to eliminate the marriage penalty
and the way you've got it, they will be at 12 and 24 single and family and this will
eliminate the marriage penalty, certainly in the tax case.
Yes sir.
Helps our lower middle income families I think the most in it, it does it quicker.
All right.
And then the other substantial change is that tax payers will have the option to itemize
or filed with a standard deduction from the federal code.
You want to explain that a little bit.
If you itemize at the federal level, then you can choose whether you want to drag your
itemization down or if you want to take the standard deduction as an itemizer.
And that was again suggested by the Society of Accountants who has written an endorsement
letter for this portion, or all portions of the bill except for the newest that you presented
today.
Okay.
And let me look, you want to talk about the $300 and why you're doing that, that tax credit.
Yeah.
When you move it from the personal exemption and you bounce it off against what we have
under current law in 2023 and prior, what you see is that itemizers get a
portion of the personal exemption at, you know, individual level and they get
it married and in order to offset that personal exemption, we wanted to make
sure that, you know, everybody's taxes were lower or, you know, reduced or zero
and this is the number that we reach that would would accomplish that
objective so it would be 300 per taxpayer which means 600 for those that are
buried following joint. Alright so it's a slight change on what we had done. Why
don't we go to the fiscal note on it now? Yes sir. So I do want to do a little
of explain on that because if you go to the note, of course, this is on LC 4327693,
which doesn't have the other two sections in it, but this is the financial part of it.
If you look at it and go across the five years, there is a line of rate reductions.
So if you get 20, 27, is everybody got that chart?
Okay, if you get 20, 27, the 133.7 and my opinion was going to happen anyway because the
rate reduction was already in process and the same on the 476.3.
So the new part of the bill would be everything below those lines which would be or really
just the next line which is the 63.8156.4103.922.2 and actually a positive of 62.9 if you don't count
the 476 reduction or in there. Does that make sense to everybody? Y'all following me okay just
want to be sure we understood the fiscal note on that. All right any questions on Chairman
black months part of this time.
Sure.
Let me just ask one quick.
I always, from accounting terms, normally brackets mean one thing to us and sometimes
it means different things.
The brackets on this, does that mean that's a savings to the taxpayer or does that
mean I say savings to the government?
That's less government.
Less government to the government.
So we save money for the taxpayer.
So that period of time is $415 million.
But again, that was already in there.
The 476 was already going to happen anyway
from last year's tax bill.
And the 133.7 was already going to happen
from last year's tax bill.
So even though those are in there to me,
that's sort of not germane, but that's the way it's written.
I agree.
So the standard deductions being greater at the bottom,
obviously will help people at the bottom more like he said,
because it's going to their part of it.
Greater percentage of their income.
Right, right.
Good but put center albers.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Blackman, I just want to say thank you
for your hard work on this.
cleaning up the standard deductions and raising those,
making it that you don't have to go from federal or state
is a really big deal that most people probably won't realize
until they get to that point that they have to make
those changes and eliminate marriage penalties.
So thank you.
I know you've spent a lot of time and effort on this.
We really appreciate your hard work on it.
Thank you, Chairman.
Thank you very much.
Senator Tilbury.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Blamin, I want to say the same thing.
Very rarely does a bill come before this committee
that I am actually in favor of.
But this does, what I think we're setting out to do, we want to reduce the tax burden
on everyday Georgians, regardless of their business owners or folks who are working
at those businesses.
And that's why I sometimes were very, very tough on the credits that come before this
committee, because every time as you see in this fiscal note here, to reduce at a tenth
of a percent is quite a large dollar amount and every time we're giving it away a million
dollars or $500 million at a time we don't get to reduce the top end rate and I want to
tell you and the members of the House thank you for sending us this or working with us
on this so that we can reduce the top end rate for everybody which will also benefit those
Georgia businesses.
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
And Chairman Tillery's point, we do have the governor's rebate that you did, but if you
take that out, the one that we just passed out that our Chairman Tillery voted against
is more than all the others that this committee has passed out added up together this year
of new.
There have been some existing ones that continue of new.
75% of the needs so it's been it's been a year really we want to really look at
all these things closely in the off-session
no we have it so we've got another section there I know there's several people
But if study this you want anybody want to go over this section
You want to discuss it or anybody else
Senator Hillary. I mean I can read it for you
I don't know that I had any pre-knowledge of it coming before now
but section seven
Aminza sales tax exemption and paragraph seven of code section 28 it basically says the debt added language
It looks like it's a sells and tangible personal tax exemption for nonprofit hospitals and the added
language in 232 through 235 just says, you know, you've got to be a non-profit hospital.
You've got to do inpatient hospice, so there's different things you can do.
And it says further that you also cannot have been the entity or directly control an affiliate
entity that terminated the operation of a hospital containing a level one trauma center
and at least 200 inpatient beds after January 1st, 2021 and still be eligible for this assumption.
I think it's a good thing. I'm for it. And this obviously deals with a with a couple of closures done in really poor areas, and I know I've heard some people on on the other on the minority caucus that have been concerned about the same issue.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Chairman Tillery, for that summary.
Does anyone know whether those hospitals are able to roll over the exemption into future
years?
Because if they can, I'm not sure that that does enough.
I don't know the answer that but sometimes you can roll over losses and I would I
would think they wouldn't be recognized but Senator Chilery will let an attorney
answer that. Well I'm not tax lawyer so be careful about this but I hear what
you're saying Senator Estavez you'd want to go further potentially go further
I think this is a good first step also noted I think it sells and use tax so I
don't know that there's a roll over all sells and use tax but I would defer to
to our esteemed legislative council in the back who might be able to say that that's true or not?
All right, we had a motion, I think, by Senator Albertson's going to make it to do pass this bill.
We've got a second by Senator Ambert Orte, any other discussion?
all those in favor of this raise your hands any opposed one opposed we've
had one opposed on both of my guests now so all right motion carries and those
are the two items for this committee we're adjourned remind the committee
members that we do have our committee dinner tonight and we'll be joining ways
It means it's decided they would go with us and for the dinner tonight, thank you.
You
