Thank you.
We all stand for the pledge allegiance to flag.
I pledge allegiance to flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which
it stands, one nation under God in the visible with liberty and justice for all.
And the Georgia flag.
I pledge allegiance to the Georgia flag and the principal for which it stands with justice
on our way to be perfected.
Thank you, Mr. President.
It's great to have the past of the day here.
MacVendome is the chaplain at the Advent Redmond Hospital in Rome, Georgia.
Has been there for six years, came from Florida.
Now, one thing we do, and I work at both hospitals in Rome, but one thing he does there in
the morning, we have a hospital-wide prayer where we all stop unless somebody's in emergency
situation, and the entire hospital stops and prays.
Now, it just seems to me like he spends an inordinate amount of time praying for me that
I'm capable of doing my job, but maybe that's just me, I don't know, but I seem to get
a little extra attention sometimes.
But he has served there as the director of mission and ministry for oversight at that hospital.
He's board certified chaplain and he tries to provide spiritual and support and comfort
whole patient, those are, as you know, very difficult times for patients and for families
and help some navigate through the illnesses, the sometimes losses and the man's of health
care.
So he's been trained in crisis intervention and debriefing and is really a passion advocate
for whole patient care.
With that, if the chaplain would say a few words for us and then lead us in a prayer.
Thank you so much.
Thank you, Senator Chuck.
This is the old bio, I'm a company here with my fiance, and so it is good that men is
not alone, and so she's here with me and I just want to thank the senator, thank you
Mr. President and my man up there in the gallery, Scottie, I'm just a joy to represent
Advent Health.
I serve as the director of chaplain services for Advent Health Georgia, and today I just
wanted to talk to you about the city that I now live in.
I came here from Florida not too long ago.
I'm still adjusting to this cold.
When I came, I didn't have a beanie or a scarf.
Now I have the full gamut in my closet.
I am ready now.
But today I want to tell you about the three rivers
that meet in Rome.
In Rome, there are three rivers that converge.
The Edoa, the Ustanala, and you have the Kusa.
The Edoa and the Ustanala, they meet to start to flow
into the Kusa River.
And this is known as convergence.
Convergence is what I would like to talk about today
as these three distinct rivers joined together
to form something that is stronger, that is life-giving.
They do not lose their identity.
However, they meet to offer a new one.
This reminds me of the Forch Appalens.
February 3rd, there were Forch Appalens 1943
that would converge, different faith traditions,
different religions, different journeys,
yet in the most pivotal moment,
where there was a great crisis on the SS Dorchester,
they would converge together to meet a common purpose,
that they rather die and see others live,
then for them to live and watch others die,
others die in silence.
There are moments in life that will call for convergence.
Like the rivers that meet at one point,
they choose unity over division,
service over self-preservation.
When the life jackets ran out,
each of these chaplains gave their life jacket
to someone else.
Witnesses will later recall as the ship was sinking.
They prayed, they sung,
and they encouraged those around them.
Hear me, hear me well, my dear friends.
They didn't merge by abandoning who they were.
They converge by offering the very essence
of who they were.
That is the heart of convergence.
Convergence is not sameness, it is shared purpose,
it is many paths flowing together for the good of others.
Today I say to you, my descendant,
May we also converge.
The reality is, we all have different backgrounds,
different political parties, different opinions.
But for the good of the people of Georgia,
may we also converge.
We all have different beliefs.
We all sometimes, I can imagine,
when you're crept up in this room,
it's hard to stand each other.
But my prayers, may you always stand by each other.
There are times I can imagine,
when you're going through a lot of delegation
and then you start to get impatient with one another.
But my prayer is even when it's hard to like each other.
May you live up to the creed from the Almighty
to love each other.
And finally, on the days when your nerves begin
to run a little low, I wanna let you know
that the Almighty's not just a giver of life.
He's the creator.
My prayer is that he'll give you more nerves
to continue to encourage each other.
As the three rivers in Rome flow to create
One mighty river called the Kusa,
may all the different little rivers in this room,
converge together to create a mighty river
of healing, of hope, of restoration.
So that Georgia will always be the ultimate
and greatest state in all of the United States.
As the song goes, Georgia, Georgia on my mind,
and I know that Georgia is always on God's mind.
Dear Senators, you not just have a position.
You have a calling and a purpose.
May you always live up to it.
Let us pray.
Dear God, as we pause for a moment,
I pray for these dear Senators.
On the days when they're tired,
may you give them strength.
On the days when the keyboard warriors
want to just simply destroy, may you build them up.
On the days when the opinions seem to be so loud,
may they hear the voice of the Almighty saying,
well done, my good and faithful servant.
I pray to the Lord that all of the rivers in this room
may converge and meet you, the Almighty,
at a place where you will be able to flow through them
and Georgia will continue to be the light upon the hill,
a place that shines a love of Christ every single day.
Be with us now.
Guide this Senate in Jesus' name I pray.
And all of God's children said, Amen.

If I could have everyone's attention, we always like to welcome our doctors of the day
to day and we've got a good one from the Augusta Georgia area originally and I'll recognize
That's a good senator from the 14th to introduce our doctor of the day.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Good morning, colleagues.
I'm so proud to start off District 14's domination of the Doctor of the Day Space this
session.
With Northside Hospital on Georgia 400, we are renowned.
Stay wide for our doctors of the day.
And today I have the distinct honor of introducing Dr. Osama Hashmi.
he went to the University of Georgia,
Godawks, did the same program there that I did.
In fact, we just missed each other.
We were, he started right as I left,
and Dr. Hashmi is a dermatologist in Atlanta.
He is successful in business as well.
He is the CEO of Impericus,
which was rated on a fast 500 list
as the number one fastest growing company in the United States.
So again, just underscoring that we can have medical,
technical expertise and professionalism
that couples very well with the growth of small businesses
in a state that is friendly towards them.
And I now will introduce Dr. Hashmi
to share a couple words.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
Everyone, thank you for having me and looking forward
to hopefully not seeing you all in the medical station.
Just remember, I am a dermatologist.
So there's some more qualified physicians in this room.
Just want to say thank you.
I am a Muslim, I'm an entrepreneur, I'm a physician,
I intentionally have a born race here in Georgia,
stay here in Georgia despite having spent a lot of time
in the Bay Area in New York.
I wanted to thank you for upholding
Georgia's values of entrepreneurship,
opportunity, empathy, diversity,
and most importantly, southern hospitality,
treating strangers like their family.
I don't have any Botox with me as well,
but if you guys do wanna come down,
I think we have some snacks
and happy to take care of y'all today.
Thank you very much.
All right.
Good job.

We have a very special guest here today from Clark Atlanta University.
They are always welcome guests and I'm glad to have them here again today and I'd like
to call them the Secretary to Read Resolution.
Senate Resolution 639 by Senators Orock of the 36th and others.
A resolution recognizing February 2nd, 2026 as Clark Atlanta University Day at the state
capital and for other purposes. Whereas Clark Atlanta University was the nation's first
four-year liberal-call arts college to serve a primarily African American student population
and whereas the university's four schools offer 40 academic programs to 3,920 students
annually. Whereas President George T. French serves as the longest serving HBCU president
in the country and has for many years provided dedicated service to higher education of
Georgia citizens. Now, therefore be it resolved by the Senate that the members of this
body recognize February 2nd, 2026 as Clark Atlanta University Day at the State Capitol.
Mr. President, that completes the order.
All right, is there objection to adoption resolution? Chair here is on the resolution
is adopted. Like to recognize Senator from the 36 to speak to the resolution and introduce
Thank you so much and good morning colleagues as we gather here on a cold Monday we are happy
to be back under the gold dome and ready to do business and it's such a timely opportunity
to recognize a historic institution that we have here in Georgia and we have with us
today the leadership of that institution. That is Clark Atlanta University. There's a
history that goes all the way back to the Civil War when this college of higher learning
was formed here in Atlanta. And it has played a critically important role in educating
leaders and providing opportunities to those who had been locked out of access to higher
education historically. So I am particularly proud today to have this opportunity to join
with the leadership of the institution here on Clark Atlanta University Day at the State
capital. We have graduates of that institution with us that are members here in
this Senate and I will thank you, Governor. There's much rich history here. We
would all be well advised to learn from the history of Clark Atlanta University.
The esteemed leader, Dr. George T. French Jr., is the fifth president of Clark Atlanta University.
Clark Atlanta University is the largest United Negro College Fund member institution in the country.
Dr. French is the longest-serving sitting HBCU president.
He's driven transformative advances in education, including under his leadership,
securing gifts from the Arthur and Blank Family Foundation of $16.5 million, and Mackenzie Scott's foundation of $53 million for Clark AU.
His strategic leadership has forged partnerships with major corporations, such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft,
which has enhanced educational opportunities and technological integration for Clark AU.
Under Dr. French's leadership, the college has launched initiatives to improve access to
higher education, expand research capabilities, increase student success rates.
The university's reputation as a leader in innovation and social impact has been secured
under the leadership of Dr. French.
He's recognized in who's who in Black Atlanta, Georgia trends 100 most influential Georgians
And he's actively engaged with other professional organizations as well.
He was the president of Miles College for 13 years where he significantly impacted the
local economy and advanced educational programs.
And there are close to a dozen high-profile organizations in higher education that he
that participates in and has had roles in leading being
member or chair or president.
He's just fits the bill of what the institution Clark Atlanta
University was looking for when he came on board.
And his educational background is a BA in political science
from the University of Louisville, a jurist doctorate
from Miles Law School and a PhD in higher education
from Jackson State University.
He'll share with us both the illustrious history
and today's enormous contributions
that this institution continues to make.
It is my honor to bring him forward
and present him with this resolution
on Clark Atlanta University Day,
February the 2nd, as we start a new month here at the Capitol, it's a great honor to
bring to you Dr. George French, the President, and present this resolution.
Thank you.
Good morning to the President of the Georgia Senate, our friend Lieutenant Governor
Burke Jones, to all of our friends in the Senate.
And I say that without qualification.
Because Senator, when I arrived in the great state of Georgia,
to take the helm of Clark Atlanta University, six years ago,
immediately, Senator Orrick made sure
that I was introduced to the Senate.
And in these six years, you all have become our friends.
So when I come now to the legislature,
both in the House and the Senate,
we have friends on both sides of the aisle,
for which we are grateful.
And I'm grateful for my vice president
who have joined me this afternoon
to include my chief of staff,
to include a Sherry Klingmer,
to include the senior vice president and provost,
academic affairs, Dr. Charlene Gilbert,
Mr. David for Boni, Vice President of Institutional Advancement, Dr. Marshall, Dr. Marshall
Taggart, Vice President for Governor Affairs, and I don't think the lieutenant governor
you're not with us yet, are you, you're gonna, but you have been, and he has been with us.
And of course to President Pro Tem Larry Walker, Senate Minority Leader and our friend
Harold Jones, out of Augusta, and again we thank all of our senators to include those to my right and Max Burns who we saw in the back, Senator Anderson, Wicks.
All of these up here, you all know who they are, so I don't have to go through those names, but I say to each and every one of you, thank you.
Thank you for this recognition to stand yet again before this august body
With convergence we are converging. I heard the preacher say this morning. We are converging so we converge
On this upon this great chamber to say thank you and to let you know that on behalf of the more than
4,000 students and remember that we offer
for bachelor's masters through the PhD.
We have the only institute HBC in the nation
that offers the PhD in cyber physical systems.
I want you to know that we're over 4,000 students.
On behalf of those students, we have three things.
We bring talent to Georgia.
We bring prepared training for the future workforce to Georgia.
And we bring support for cutting edge technology,
research and education in cancer prevention
through our Cancer, our CCRTD Cancer Research and Therapy
League Development Center, and Data Science,
Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning.
We bring these things to strengthen one of the greatest
states within the Union, our great state of Georgia,
our great state of Georgia, our great state of Georgia,
is what we celebrate and know that we come to contribute
to our great state, to our great economy.
Thank you again, Mr. President, for this opportunity
to represent Clark Atlanta University
and to say thank you for your support.
God bless America and God bless the great state of Georgia.
Because Georgia's on my mind.
That's good.
Thank you so much.
I love you.

Are there any unanimous concerns?
Does any senator wish to rise on a point of personal privilege?
We're going to send them from the 8th for a point of personal privilege.
Good morning, colleagues. This is my first time in the way of this session. I just wanted
to bring something that came to my attention this weekend and wanted to bring it to your
attention. You know, I tell people all the time that we've got our friends out in the
hallway you know that lobbyists and you know what is our job our job is to be
a lobbyist for the common men and women of this state the everyday
Georgians that get up every day work either bills and keep this state running so
today I'm going to lobby for Miss Mia Miss Mia is 20 years old Miss Mia is
working her way through school and she has got a bright future but she just
went to go buy a used car so that she could get back and forth to school into work. She
was buying a 2023 Nissan Centra. It was $17,500. The payment on that car was $338 a month.
And she went to go get insurance, and she went to a very good friend of mine who was the
insurance agent, and he priced it with everybody that he could price insurance with, okay?
The best he could come back with for a quote, I've got it right here, for six months is $3,417
for six months, okay?
So for a year, those monthly payments are $600 a month for a $17,000 car that the payment
is $338 for.
And so I got to look in at it and I looked up the company that had quoted this price and the company's gross profit for the 12 months ending September the 30th of 2025 was 14.335 billion dollars, a 30.64% increase year over year.
Their annual gross profit for 2024 was $11.467 billion, a 106.72% increase from 2023,
and their annual gross profit for 2023 was $5.54 billion, a 224% increase over 2022.
So in two years, she'll almost paid for that car with insurance payments, and the third
year, she'll have paid for that car and have $3,000 left over.
Her insurance, her yearly insurance cost is more than her tuition.
And so I just want to say this, as we all seek to be a lobbyist for the people that we
represent back home, I want y'all to help me let's put our heads together and see if
we can't do something about this because it's wrong.
It is not right for somebody that's trying to get ahead in life and go to school.
I voted for tort reform.
I have been sued before.
I know that we have frivolous lawsuits.
But at the end of the day, we were promised
that our insurance premiums would come down.
This is not happening by what I see here.
So to everyone out there, just know that we
in the General Assembly are watching.
And I'm lobbying on behalf of Miss Mia.
To let's see if we can't do better by the citizens of Georgia,
Mr. President, I yield the will.
All right, the Senate is yielded.
We're going to have the Senate from the 13th
for a point of personal privilege.
I thank you, Mr. President.
Colleagues, this is a little update.
What's coming up for tomorrow?
The gas authority, as you all will know,
they provide cities for natural gas,
and they are excited about the passage last year
Senate Bill SB 13.
This granted jeep of the ability to provide funding
for natural gas and infrastructure,
especially in rural Georgia.
The gas authority and its members are working hard
to provide all these services needed to meet
the demand and growing areas of our state.
To highlight this work, the municipal gas systems
on their behalf have asked me to invite you all
to come to February 3rd, 8 a.m. room 230 in the capital and just show their appreciation
room 230 in the capital 8 a.m. for the natural gas authority, Mr. President, you know the
We're getting out of the center from the night for point of personal privilege.
Good morning, Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge a tragedy that struck our Gwinnett
County law enforcement family yesterday, leaving one officer dead, unfortunately, and
another officer critically injured in an unprovoked attack at a hotel.
It was a routine call that happened.
These brave officers would just serve in their community and answer in the call to protect
the residents of Gwinnett County when the tragedy occurred.
Master Police Officer David M. Reed and Police Officer Senior Perdit Tameh.
To the family of officer Tameh, I extend my deepest condolences.
Words can express the pain of such a devastating loss.
I hope people find comfort in knowing that he will be honored for his selflessness and
ultimate sacrifice.
I think my colleague, the center of 445th, actually had a met officer to main in person at one
of his events.
He was very young, a young officer.
I'm grateful that Master Police Officer Reed is on the path to recovery and healing,
And I stand with our community in continued plet prayer and support of our brothers and
sisters in Gwinnett County Police Department, acknowledging that the days ahead will be
challenging.
Our local law enforcement agents in Gwinnett County are truly the best.
And matter of fact, this incident is very rare for Gwinnett County to lose officers.
We haven't lost officers in a line of duty in a while.
They do their best to keep us secure and gain our trust.
We're praying for them and we thank them all and be sure to keep doing that.
To all the law enforcement officers, all our first responders and anyone who has served
this great community in our nation in any way, thank you for your service and your sacrifice
May the good Lord bless each and every one of them and with that Mr. President I
ask for a moment of silence for officer. Senator Cresson, have you
I remember staying as for a moment of silence.
Thank you, Senator.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I yield the bill.
Bring it down to the center from the 50 second for personal
ribbons!
I'm not going to do it.
I'm not going to do it.
You might hit my butt.
Break it down the center from the 29th.
just a little bit about the Gwyneth police officer who was murdered a couple
days ago. Showman was 25 years old, had been on the job for eight months and called
out early in the morning for what the average non-post certified law enforcement
officer would consider a routine call. While all law enforcement officers, people that
have actually done the job understand there is nothing like a routine call. There's no
such thing. If you go to the officer down website and you look at the number of officers
who are killed on traffic stops.
If you look at the number of officers who are killed
on domestic violence calls, if you look at the officer
that was just assaulted over in Warner Robbins the other day,
on a domestic violence call.
If you look at the tens of thousands of law enforcement
officers that are assaulted every single year,
There's one reason why more officers don't die every year.
And I give that credit to the senator from the first
and everybody in his profession that we've gotten better
at saving lives.
But for a young man whose future lied fully in front of him
to go out there and do the job and to give his life for doing
watch right is completely unacceptable. And sadly, I speak at a lot of
memorials throughout the year, and I remind people each and every day that we
all die to deaths. We die the death when our heart stops beating, and we die the
second death when our memory fades. And so I'm honored to go to Washington, D.C. and look at the
memorial there to the tens of thousands of law enforcement officers, men, women, white, black,
brown that come from all over the world and come here to this country to become an American citizen
and then to turn around and serve the community who accepted them with open arms.
I'm reminded that we can never let them die of that second death.
Please keep this young man in your thoughts and your prayers every May 15th.
Thanks to President John F. Kennedy, we have a day to remember all of these men and women.
But never forget that.
So, when you allow politics and ideology to build a cocoon around your brain when it comes
to law enforcement, whether they are county, whether they are municipal, whether they are
state, whether they are federal, understand you're doing more damage than that initial bullet
did.
This officer will live a long, long life thanks to his memory, thanks to his sacrifice,
his dedication. This is not about politics. This is about people and dignity. Thank you, Mr. President,
I yield the well. Thank you, Senator. We're going to have Senator from 39.
Thank you, Mr. President. I rise to speak with both disappointment and concern
about the direction of our nation's cultural center, the John F. Kennedy Center
for the performing arts. Yesterday's headlines confirm that the Kennedy Center
will halt its entertainment and operations for renovations for approximately
two years beginning on our nation's 250th birthday on July 4th, a dramatic shift
announced by President Trump who in 2025 appointed himself chairman of the
institution's board and recently oversaw a controversial renaming of the
center itself. The Kennedy Center was never meant to be just a building nor
reserve for a select few. It was meant to be a place where families brought
their kids where students sitting far from D.C. could still benefit from its education programs,
and where tourists and working people alike could simply walk through the doors for free or with
a ticket and see something meaningful on stage almost every single night of the week.
The center is not a small or symbolic operation. It houses multiple stages, is home to the
the National Symphony Orchestra and the Washington National Opera and anchors
touring productions seen by audiences from every state. For more than 50 years
since opening in 1971, the Kennedy Center has remained open through changing
administrations, economic downturns and moments of national uncertainty, making
any shutdown, let alone a multi-year one unprecedented in its history.
When an institution of this scale shows signs of instability, the consequences ripple far
beyond its walls.
As President Kennedy himself once said, the life of the arts, far from being an interruption,
a distraction in the life of a nation, is very close to the center of a nation's purpose.
It is a test of the quality of a nation's civilization.
That vision was never about art for art's sake.
It was about the role culture plays in a healthy, confident democracy.
I speak to this personally as someone who had the privilege of chairing the President's
Advisory Committee on the Arts during the Kennedy Center's most recent $175 million
capital campaign.
work was about stewardship, expanding the campus, strengthening the institution's foundation,
and ensuring this national center would remain open, welcoming and relevant to the American
people for generations to come.
Can you imagine if another administration were to decide that the money that we just put
into building the new office building across the street didn't serve its purpose and we
We were to start all over again because new times, not good enough.
That is why I say with regret that the recent decisions at the Kennedy Center, the abrupt
overhaul of its board, the departure of artists who no longer feel welcome, and now the announcement
of a multi-year closure have not advanced the mission.
When those doors close, literally or figuratively, we don't just lose performances.
We lose a shared civic space that brings people together across backgrounds, beliefs and
income levels, and that weakened something far bigger than the arts.
Institutions like this survive on trust, public trust, donor trust, community trust.
Once that trust is shaken, it is far harder to rebuild than any building itself ever could
be.
The board has a choice before it, to safeguard an institution that belongs to the American
people, or to preside over a decision that will diminish it for years to come.
A multi-year closure is not an inevitability, it is a decision, and decisions like this
require courage, especially the courage to say no, even when that pressure comes from
the most powerful person in the room.
Thank you.
Senator from the 14th, you wish the point of person privilege.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I'm sad that the Senate from the 8th is not here in this moment for me to boost him so
enthusiastically.
But did you all hear what the Senate from the 8th said just a few moments ago about a
a constituent whose car insurance rates.
Thank you for coming back, sir.
I wanna boost you, because that's a crazy story
that those car insurance rates keep going up.
And in fact, our insurance commissioner, John King,
said something to this same effect back in November.
I don't know if you guys caught this,
but our commissioner on insurance and safety fire
did a tweet where he acknowledged
that insurance company profits have grown
and that rates seem to keep rising.
I'm curious if y'all remember the incident
that prompted our insurance commissioner to say
that insurance company profits should be capped.
Capped, by the way, you know, hashtag Capitalism.
Our insurance commissioner said we should cap
insurance company profits.
And the reason he did that was not
because he received constituent stories like this.
The reason was not because he got a PDF
from insurance companies showing their exact financials.
No, the reason the insurance commissioner said
that we should cap insurance company profits
is because the day before a Democrat
a state house special election in Athens, Georgia, in Clark and
a county counties after he had lost that same race the year prior by 22 points.
So I think what happened was the insurance commissioner was trying to warn
the Republican Party that if you didn't take real action on car insurance and
other insurance rates, real action, not fake action, that you were probably going to
keep losing elections, which it turns out is actually the hammer that has to drop
for the political courant to change.
Now let's be very clear about what Democrats were saying
during the entirety of the tort reform debate.
We were saying that insurance companies make profits
in the billions with a B, not millions with an M,
billions with a B, and that threat that John King said
was so present and real that the insurance companies
had a gun to his head and said,
we will leave the state if you do not give us
the sacrifice we require.
If you do not sacrifice plaintiffs' personal injury
lawsuit rights on the altar of insurance company profits, then we will leave the state.
As it turns out, that was probably baloney.
And as it turns out, the only way that rates are going to come down is if insurance company
profits are capped, which is exactly what your insurance commissioner John King said back
in November in response to a loss.
The last thing I'll say is that we were promise that even if the insurance rates don't
go down, they will at least stabilize.
I would submit to you that the reason the word stabilize was used is because it was so
far fetched that insurance companies would somehow pass along savings to consumers and
that rates would come down that they knew that that was too bold faced of a lie to promise
during the tort reform discussion.
What happened in 2025 is that the Georgia Chamber of Commerce quarterback, an insurance company
led effort to lie to the people of Georgia through the mouth of Brian Kemp to tell everybody
that their insurance rates would go down or stabilize if we cut plaintiffs' rights
at the knees. Plenty of opposition told you that in other states, like Florida and
the Carolinas, which by the way, both Donald Trump and Donald Trump Jr. went on record
saying that those were tort-reformed scams, we went on record telling you that every
time tort-reform had been passed, the rates didn't go down. So with the utmost respect
for the center from the eighth who is telling you what is admittedly and truthfully a sad
story about rates continuing to go up. Let's just do the most basic level of accountability
in our political discourse and acknowledge that everything we heard from the pro-tort reform
camp in 2025 was a completely toothless and feckless scam. Thank you very much Mr. President.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Good morning, Mr. President.
Colleagues, today I rise to recognize Lagrange chapter of the links incorporated
chartered June the 30th of 1979.
What began in 1978 as an interest group of 20
service-minded women has grown into a powerful network.
Now 39 active members committed to enriching the lives
of African descent through education, health, civil
engagement, the service across multiple counties in Georgia
and Alabama.
Their legacy includes youth scholarship initiatives,
voter-right efforts, programs like Lincoln Pink,
black care, the Dignity Project,
a dress-in-period property,
alongside partnerships with organizations like NAACP,
the America Accounts of Society,
they were honored as the southern area
of the start chapter, both in 2021 and 2022 and 2023.
in 2023. Thank you so much. I yielded well.
Break it down to the center from 21st.
Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate that.
Good morning colleagues. It was good to see everybody here today.
today. I want to take just one quick minute and recognize my page for the day. My page
for the day is Mr. Cohen Kirkley and he's a ninth grader from Ottawa High School. I've
known his family for 25 years and it's been amazing to watch this young man grow up. He's
been an excellent student from elementary school all the way through middle school. This
year he joined the JROTC program as one of the Raiders. And furthermore, he won't be
in the only ninth grader this year to compete on the A team for the JROTC for Ottawa High
school. So as a lot of you are aware, I'm a huge veteran advocate. I always support our veterans.
I also want to make sure that I recognize all the veterans that we have here in the Senate
today, both as senators and as staff members as well. There's quite a few of you. So I want to make
sure that I say thank you for your service. Thank you for everything that you continue to do
every day for our veterans. And I just want to tell Mr. Cohen, currently it's been a pleasure
knowing you. I look forward to seeing all the great things that you continue to do and looking
You can see where your lap takes you.
Thank you so much.
Mr. President, I yield the well.
Greg and I are the senator from the Fitch fourth.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I will try not to be too long because I know we're going.
I just I did want to rise this morning just to say that as this morning as we're
remembering those in public safety who give their lives to understand each
that we never one of us take a moment to realize that those in public safety do
a job that the vote those of us in this room the majority of us in this room
could not do could not do because there's a reason that you go through all that
training, whether in the military or public safety, it's because it's literally, the Bible
says it's Christ of sin in heaven, He gave gifts unto mankind, and it's literally to have
the heart of a liberator that we're gifted with that allows some people to run forward
toward their own demise when anybody else in the right mind will be running away.
So let us always remember those men and women who put themselves on the front line each
every day in any regard that they do and just part of that I also want to let
everyone know that tomorrow Georgia Aerospace and Defense Day will be
Georgia Aerospace and Defense Day at the Capitol and you have another
opportunity and also if any of you ever want to be an F-35 pilot fighter pilot
they will have a simulator here today and tomorrow in the Rotunda and you're
welcome to take your turn is sitting in the hot seat and seeing how well you do
Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity and I will yield the will.
Thank you, Senator.
I recognize the senator from the 28th of a point of personal privilege.
Yeah, I'm so much nicer.
Yeah, I'm so much nicer for me.
Yeah, I'm soíssolane.
Thank you.
I'm thinking, you're gonna stay up?
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, today is a wonderful day here at State Capitol.
We have great people who have come to join us as we soon deliberate, I think, on some
We had Clark Atlanta already and I had to mention them even though I graduated from Morris
Brown College, two of my sisters graduated from there and my father, my mother graduated
from Spelman College and my older sister.
So I think we made the round, oh and my late husband graduated from Moore House.
So I think we made the round so I have to give honor to them for coming today and already
being Dr. French and Dr. Marshall's target always have me in the parade.
So I didn't want them to kick me to the curb.
All right.
But the greatest thing that I can say today is that I'm proud to be the one of the
representatives in Cobb County, namely, Mabelton George.
And we have the other members who are also Cobb County.
And Kay is somewhere, but she's so busy.
Rachel Hanks also represents Cobb County.
Today, we have with us from the great city of Mapleson.
We have our very own mayor.
And out of the little bit, come on.
They might not let you come up here, but because I'm so proud
that Mayor Craig Owens is with us.
Oh, I said, well, I have Craig on here.
I know that it didn't sound right.
Anyway, excuse me, we got you another name now,
but Mayor Michael Owens.
Also, we have the city manager, Bill Tanki, where are you?
And Executive Director of the Epi Center, Dr. Chris Boyne,
also from Word of Faith, that's my other church.
Also, we have city council persons.
Everybody, please raise your hand on this side,
as well as this side, and Jaha, that's your twin in it.
Y'all look just alike, but I know you're probably not even,
Councilman Michael McNeely, Mayor Pro Tem, Ron Davis, and the list goes on.
We're recognizing today as Mabelton Day at the State Capitol.
And we had a resolution that's been dropped, but not read, and it states, Mabelton, Georgia
is a vibrant community located in Cobb County.
It was officially incorporated as a city
following a successful rev from Brindam.
Oh, we can't get it out.
November 8th of 22, making it the largest city in Cobb County
with the population of approximately 47,000 residents.
and, whereas the city was named after Scottish immigrant Robert Mabel, who purchased land
in the area in 1843 and established a farm that would later become central to the community's
growth with the historic Robert Mabel House and cemetery also, not serving as an iconic
landmark that hosts public performances and events.
Whereas Mabelton's early development
was shaped by the arrival of the Georgia Pacific Railway
and which is constructed a train depot in 1881,
spurring economic growth and transforming
the area into a vital commercial hub.
and then rural Cobb County,
whereas the community benefits from a strategic location
along major highways,
including Interstate 285,
providing convenient access to Atlanta
and supporting the city's economic and residential growth.
It goes on and on,
but we will say whereas Maplethane
continues to experience growth and revitalization as well as uphold the commitment to fostering
economic development. I wish you'll give me a few more minutes. Okay, my time has expired,
but please all the people from Mapleton that's here and up in the gallery, please stand.
And Senators, let's give them a warm Senate welcome, please.
Thank you for coming.
And I wish I had put everybody else's name down so y'all could speak to you.
Thank you.
Senator, we appreciate the people from Ableton being here more than you know.
Thank you.
Thank each and every one of y'all for being here today.
Thank you, Senator.
Appreciate you.
recognize the center from 36 for a point of personal privilege recognize center from the
This is the 50th for a point in person privilege.
My distinguished colleagues, I rise today because I am concerned with where our nation is going
in the form of our democracy and how it indirectly affects something that happened in my district.
Something happened yesterday in my district, and the whip is not here, but the whip acknowledged
it.
law enforcement officer who failed that was in my district, that was in less than 10 minutes
from my house where this officer whose name has not been called, his name is Pre-Deep
Temang.
And I stand because of twofold, a twofold reason.
He was a law enforcement officer who failed and we got to recognize that.
But I stand also because he was born in Nepal.
And if you saw him outside of this uniform, he may be one of the persons who have come
up to me and said that they were so concerned that they were carrying around copies of their
passport.
In my district, I have so many diverse people and pre-deep to Meng was born in Nepal, but
he was serving the people of Georgia.
And we have to give him respect not only when he's in a law enforcement uniform, and that's
That's why I'm standing here because I despise any death, let alone a death of a law enforcement officer.
But I want to say that our political violence speaks, our hate speech has got not a hand.
It's created an atmosphere where people are not respected.
The value of life itself is depreciated.
And we must elevate our speech to statesmanship nationally and states wide.
And I believe Georgia can even lead the federal government in elevating our stance on how
we speak to one another, how we respect one another.
Why am I saying this?
Because I noticed with great disappointment.
In September we lowered the federal flags for a man that I don't want to die, but I despised
what he stood for.
He stood for.
He was a Christian right advocate for Christian nationalism.
I am a real Christian and I respect Christianity.
But there was a person who the flag was Lord for a person that espoused hate speech, a person
who criticized the Civil Rights Act of 1964, without which I could not stand right here
where I'm standing right now.
But he was lifted up and the flags were Lord for him.
When he criticized Dr. Martin Luther King, we Lord our flag for that same gentleman, as
well as promotion of false allegations of electoral fraud in 2020 and white genocide conspiracy theory.
We lowered our flag for that gentleman.
And why is that important?
That is important because very few of you, I dare say very few of you, can remember in
June of the last year, when a person who was the minority leader in Minnesota, the person's
name was Melissa Hartman and her husband, who died because she was the speaker of the
house in Minnesota. She was the minority in 2017 to 2019. But in 2019, she became the
speaker of the house that said that the politics changed just because one
party is in power we should not shift our allegiances but we don't know the
name of Melissa Hortman. We don't know that name. We don't know the name of
Pradeek Tamang but we should respect everyone and I say that we have to
respect because I don't want us to stop respecting police officers and being
afraid to open our door for a police officer. Because you know what happened in Minnesota?
A police officer, that's who the killer posed himself as when he shot and killed Melissa Hartman.
He posed as a policeman. And that was the only thing that we respected is that badge. And we got
to elevate that badge and elevate all human respect for human life. I yield the well as I call the
the name of Pradeep Taman, as well as Melissa Hortman,
because all life is valuable,
as well as our law enforcement officers.
Thank you, and I yield the well.
All right, thanks Senator.
Does any other Senator which rise on point of personal privilege?
Senator from 36.
I called on the earlier Senator, but you.
You.
You were deep in conversation with somebody.
The colleagues I rise today to speak about
what's going on in our state
And in our nation, deeply, deeply troubling set of facts that we are observing.
And I, of course, join with the senator from the cab in lifting up the name of Melissa
Hortman.
I knew her.
I served on boards with her.
I knew her leadership.
I knew her inclusive approach to leadership.
And I mourn yet, and still, that this impeccable public servant was shot down in co-blood at
the door of her home, along with her husband, who both lost their lives at the hands of
someone absolutely bought into conspiracy theory and political violence as the appropriate
response.
That's what that was there.
And we are going down that dangerous road
at an ever-ever increasing pace.
I'm from Fulton County.
I represent Fulton County.
Fulton County's
voter center
where we store all our ballots,
where we administer the process of voting in our county.
was rated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
What world are we living in?
What world are we living in?
When the FBI using some Missouri official,
deems that they have the right to storm our Bowdoin Center
here in Fulton County, and to take all the records
from the 2020 elections, and refused to document for our local officials who were there on
site. The FBI refused to document what they took, how much they took, and it was not
small, it was they wanted everything, everything, and what are they going to use it for?
glorious accusations about the 2020 election. And I say to you what we're
witnessing today should alarm every Georgian, Republican, Democrat, and
independent alike. Put yourself in our shoes, those of us in Fulton County. What
if the FBI came storming into your county and seized voter records, seized
ballots from an election? It's a terrifying escalation from the failing
administration of a wannabe strong man and we all know his name.
So let's be clear.
And I doubt that anybody in this room disagrees with me.
Georgia ran a secure election in 2020.
That fact has been confirmed again and again.
It's been confirmed by Republicans.
been confirmed by the Secretary of State, who's a member of the Republican Party, it's
been confirmed by Democrats, it's been confirmed by independent verification, neither Trump
or Giuliani or the My Pillow guy or any of Trump's other weird conspiracy theorist buddies
could find one actual piece of evidence to support their claims, contrary to what you've
heard from this well last week.
And here we are, six years later, still arguing about the 2020 election.
And why is that?
Well, Steve Bannon's on the record of saying, MAGA's core belief is they have to insist
that the 2020 election was stolen.
And we see that in action.
They send in the FBI with the woman, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
Lord.
a woman who's in charge of intelligence down here stalking out in front of our election
center. These are perilous times. These are perilous times. I don't know if the red lines
ever going to be crossed for GOP members to say, you know what, I'm going to have to
break with you on this one, honey. This is an invalid and inappropriate and illegal use
of executive power.
Keep on thinking about that, keep on looking at that behavior, state and local officials
run elections, not the president, not Washington bureaucrats, not law enforcement agencies.
We all know that.
There's a reason that they have unearthed the 2020 ballots of Fulton County and the next
blow will be, don't wait till it's too late.
The hour is now.
I yield the well, thank you.
Thank you, Senator.

Oh, wow.
All right, all right, all right, we're recognize my good doctor from the coast.
My favorite senator from Savannah, Georgia.
Good luck senator.
Thank you so much, Mr. President.
Let me just tell you, I am not here to talk about the Kennedy Center.
I'm not here to relitigate, to reform.
I'm not here to talk about the incompetence
or maybe even criminal activity in Fulton County elections.
But let me tell you what I am here to talk about.
What is affecting us here in the state of Georgia?
77% of the shrimp tested in Savannah, Georgia
was imported shrimp, places like China, India,
India and Vietnam where they grow these shrimp in ponds, swimming in their own
feces, given antibiotics and hormones. So in the state of Georgia, I'd native
domestic shrimp, called off the coast of Georgia, never has antibiotics, never
has growth hormones and are grown right here in the state of Georgia. And that's
what this bill ensures is truth in advertising. All it says is that you must
post by the shrimp whether or not or not whether or not if it is foreign
imported shrimp or you can have a placard visible to your patrons there in the
That's all it does, and believe it or not, the Georgia
Restorant Association has stopped their opposition.
Now, why would they oppose such a thing like that?
Well, I don't know, but I will tell you that our industry
in the state of Georgia on the coast is better this year
and last year than it was the year before.
Do you think it has anything to do with the truth in advertising that is coming out about the shrimp in the state of Georgia?
I think it does. Mr. President, I'll be happy to answer any questions relating to the shrimp in the state of Georgia.
I think we're clear, Senator. No questions.
Well, thank you very much. I ask for your favorable consideration for this matter for the state of Georgia and the shrimp industry.

The Senate resolution, number five, 63 by senators Robertson of the 29th and others.
A resolution urging the Secretary of State to immediately and fully comply with the request of the United States Department of Justice to securely produce Georgia's voter registration list and complies with Georgia's obligations under the National Voter Registration Act, the Help America Vote Act, and the Civil Rights Act of 1960 and for other purposes.
The Senate Committee on Ethics recommends that this resolution do pass by Senator Watson of the 11th Chairman.
Mr. President, a minority report has been attached.
Bring it on as the senator from the 29th, speak to the measure.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Colleagues, my time being in this body have yet to become surprised by the overreaction
of small adjustments, yet to be surprised by the fear and trembling I see at times when
we have to address uncomfortable issues.
And once again, it is played out exactly as I thought it might.
This resolution is very simple.
It's very clean.
A lot of people have preconceived notions about me,
about where my politics is, and other things.
And those who know me know my passion
about finding healthy mothers, healthy baby programs
throughout the state.
They know my passion about adoption.
They know my passions about foster care.
They know my passions about lowering taxes.
and they know my primary passion about public safety
and my primary passion about following the law.
So, and I know there will be caccles from the body
of people who disagree and I've become accustomed to that.
But something else I'm accustomed to also
is following the law.
Several years ago, I had the opportunity
to serve on ethics and we passed out SB 202.
And as soon as SB 202 passed and became law,
which to remind anybody, SB 202 was the voting legislation
that created the greatest turnout in the next election
that followed that than any other election prior to that.
is the one that clarified the rules on what good voting
is, what fair voting is, what transparent voting is.
And not long after that was signed into law,
I, along with 20 plus other colleagues,
were sued for passing SB 202.
Not long after that, I received a telephone call
from an attorney out of Pensacola, Florida.
And I was told that this attorney had been hired to represent me and this lawsuit against
SB 202.
And this attorney told me, he said, Senator Robertson, I'm going to have to ask you for some
information and it may be uncomfortable.
And I said, what is that?
He said, I need all of your senatorial emails.
I said no problem.
He said, I'm going to need all of your senatorial text messages.
I said, no problem.
He said, I need all of your personal emails.
I said, no problem.
And he said, well, I'm going to need all of your personal text messages.
And I said, no problem.
And then I said, but wait, there is one problem.
He said, what is that?
I said, you got to give me time to go to local department store,
local electronic store, and buy an external hard drive
that is clean and never been used.
So I can download all of this information from my cell phone
and from my computer and send it to you.
And he got quiet, and I said, is that a problem?
He said, no, that's not a problem at all.
He said, just everybody else I spoke to
were a little concerned about that information getting out there.
And I said, well, I'm not concerned about it at all.
I grew up in law enforcement.
I grew up in the courts.
I understand what evidence is.
I understand the requirements of the people I submit this
evidence to protect what I submit.
And I said, because you're going to go through all of my
personal and senatorial emails.
You're going to go through all of my personal and
senatorial text messages.
And you're going to find nothing that this suit alleges.
I said, but please never left any of the text messages
from my wife to me on days when she wasn't really happy with me
to get out into the public.
And he assured me he wouldn't.
So I went and I purchased the external hard drive
and I downloaded all of that information, all of that information.
and I sent it to the attorney, because I understand the process.
There was no conspiracy theory.
There was nothing I thought that this attorney who I met,
by the way, over the phone was going to do anything unethical
or anything that would impair his licensing in the Georgia
Bar or the Florida Bar or any other bar,
which he may have been a member of.
because I understood the law, and if you read the resolution, you'll see that we are asking
that the Secretary of State provide the information in compliance with Georgia's obligations
under the National Voter Registration Act, the Help America Vote Act, and the Civil Rights
Act of 1960.
And if you read Georgia Code Section 21-2-225.1, if you go down to Section C, if you integrate
the definitions under 21-2-417, you'll see there's a section down there.
He says the information that's included in there, that any and all information relating
to the birth dates or dates of birth to be exact, social security numbers, and driver's
license numbers of electors may be made available to other agencies of this state, to agencies
of other states and territories of the United States and to agencies of the federal government
if the agency is authorized to maintain such information. And the information is used
only to identify the elector on the receiving agency's database and is not disseminated further
and remains confidential.
in Georgia law. It's really clear. As far as I know, the Secretary of State and I have
never had a cross word with each other. We've been in the room together. I knew him
before he was Secretary of State. And what it says right here, if he were the Secretary
of State saying I didn't want to cooperate, if he was the governor of Georgia and said
I didn't want to cooperate, if he was the lieutenant governor of Georgia and said he
didn't want to cooperate, I would drop the same resolution. The law is clear on what
we're supposed to do. Now there's always going to be the politics that surrounds this. There's
always going to be those who go around and start conspiracy theories on the right, those
who start conspiracy theories on the left. What's funny is nobody will ever find a video clip
that they can play, showing me claiming that any election in Georgia has ever been stolen.
But they'll use that.
The first time I recall somebody claiming an election was done wrong or the ripper priorities
is when a guy named Gore ran for president of the United States of America and it became
a big deal.
And then after that, the next person I can recall is a former secretary of state named
Hillary Rodham Clinton that claimed there was election fraud.
And then there was a lady running for governor of Georgia who lost and claimed that there
were improprieties and that there was possible fraud and elections.
And then there was a guy who was the President of the United States and ran for re-election
and he claimed that there was election fraud.
They're all in the same boat.
They're all there, but you know what?
We have laws we have to follow.
We have rules we have to follow in this state.
It's not personal.
It's not me against you or one party against another party.
Is this uncomfortable?
It is for some.
Is this necessary?
Well, it depends.
Do you want to do the easy parts of your job
or do you want to do the full parts of your job?
Our job is really simple.
We have a state constitution.
We have laws and rules that we have to go by.
Whether we're comfortable with a law or not,
we don't get to deviate from it.
Believe me, I put handcuffs on many people I weren't comfortable with.
As I'm sure my friend from the 30th has also.
We didn't love the law we had to enforce every time we enforced it, but you know what?
We enforced it because this body or the federal government put laws down and said that.
And so this resolution is very, very simple.
Let's ask in the Secretary's State to do what other states have done and that is fully
cooperate.
Other states who felt uncomfortable about their information, they sat down at the table
and they wrote and agreed on MOUs, they signed those MOUs with the Department of Justice
and the information was handed over.
I've heard several people talking about how their information is private.
If you have a Social Security number that was not given to you by the federal government,
that's a bad news for you.
You don't have a legitimate Social Security number.
You can't buy them.
You get them through a process.
User that process is birthed here in this country.
If you think your driver's license information is not out in the real world, then I've got
some cold news for you.
It's out there.
And I can tell you, it's inside of state computers, inside of GCIC, it's inside of federal
computers, inside of NCIC, your driver's license information is out there.
And I can go to the white pages anywhere on internet and I can find out where you live.
Not only do I find out where you live today.
I can find out where you live 10 years ago and that'll take me about four and a half
minutes.
I can tell you what your birthday is.
It's not complicated.
And this information I'm getting from you and about you is not information that is
privy to me as a peace officer or privy to me as a state senator.
This information is out there for everybody.
I have friends that run private investigative agencies.
I can give them your name, a partial of your name.
And with short period of time, I don't know what all your vehicles,
the license plates on all your vehicles are.
I don't know what the Venn numbers are.
People steal identification through banking information.
They steal it through when we go in and we put our debit card in or our credit card
into a site where we were attempting to buy something and we don't realize that we're
being fished for that information.
That's what you have to worry about about identity theft.
And everybody in this room most likely has experienced some type of identity theft.
Which shocked me when somebody tried to do it to me.
I don't know why anybody else would want to be Randy Robertson, but they made that attempt
and luckily it was called in time and we were able to stop it.
It's not because I was willy-nilly with my personal information that we're talking about
here today.
So while many want to make this out to be some kind of battle for somebody, I want
to hit you with a shocker.
I love the pledge to the Georgia flag.
My loyalty first lies with the state of Georgia.
People want to label me something, had somebody come up today and ask me if I was a maga.
I don't think so.
I think I'm a conservative state senator in Georgia who is a member of the Republican Party
who is a law abiding citizen who believes you stand up for what's right.
what's for what's comfortable. If you want to stand up for what's comfortable then
please I heard somebody say it before. Don't join the team with me in the
Senator from the 30th because people looking for comfort don't do that.
People wanting to follow law do that. Retotal 21 and tell me what you think but
But today, all we're doing is urgent and elected official to do what Georgia law says he
should do.
That's all.
It's that simple.
Don't make it more than it is.
But sadly, I know some will stand on the stage, built out of political wood, as they
They look to sell themselves, to sell a policy, or to sell the hate for a man that they've
never met.
And with that, Mr. President, I yield the welcome.
As soon as you're able to bring it out as the center
from the 22nd.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I understand opposition to this particular resolution.
I will say this, there won't be any cackling in this situation
because it's a very serious moment for Georgia history.
Context matters with this resolution.
On one level, the resolution may look clean and pristine,
but context actually matters.
So let's kind of look at what that context is.
It's two levels to it.
The first is the stated reason for the resolution.
It's basically if you break it down,
is what the Department of Justice said.
They wanted the information forward,
which is to maintain voter rolls.
So let's deal with that first.
So initial reason given by the Department of Justice
was to maintain voter rolls and voter rolls,
voter lists, et cetera.
Make sure that the maintenance of the rolls are correct.
And that is basically what this resolution is trying
to develop.
Problem in this context matters.
And there was a recent court case that basically
said, federal court, that said that this is not true,
that what the Justice Department is saying
basically a lot, KC United States versus Weber, with the Department of Justice
admitted, this just happened in 2025, admitted that they were handing over the
voter information to the Department of Hand Homeland Security, and that the
request of the Justice Department mirrored similar requests that had been
doing by the Department of Homeland Security. And the court stated very bluntly.
The court does not take lightly the DOJ's
association of its true motive in the present matter.
The actual law to palm by the Justice Department,
meaning the Civil Rights Act that is in the particular
resolution, is to protect voting rights.
If the DOJ wants to instead use those statues for more than
the State of Purpose, circumventing the authority granted
to them by Congress, it cannot do so under the guise of
to protect your investigative purposes.
And that is what the context is.
So this resolution may seem clean and pristine,
but when you understand that the DOJ themselves
said we're handing this information over
to the Department of Homeland Security.
That comes from them in a court case.
And that a federal judge then said,
basically what you're telling us,
all of this stuff about pristine maintenance roles is alive.
This is court. This is law. Second aspect of the context is what happened last week.
So now we're about to pass something which is basically based on a lie because we know
that it's based on a lie because they're going to hand this information over by their own
testimony over to other organizations, other agencies. It's not about voter maintenance.
We already know that's true. Now based on what just happened in Fulton County, this resolution
takes even greater context because now it is the context of actually trying to shield
what really is a true goal of this administration which we understand is to undercut the 26 midterms
and potentially even once again try to take those. The truth of this intent has gone over
many times but I do want to point out one story. In other times 20 years ago it would have
been a major news story for years to come,
possibly would have made a movie about it.
But in our click days, it kind of goes, comes and goes.
The scene is January 4, 2021.
In a real respected retired judge, Judge Lutick,
who is now retired, is at home.
He had been on the short list by George,
but President George W. Bush, was beaten out
by Samuel Alito to be on the Supreme Court.
So a very serious person.
He receives a phone call from Vice President Pence's
personal attorney.
And he's asked immediately, what do you think about John
Eastman?
Ludic knew that John Eastman was one of the president's lawyers.
He was understood constitutional law.
And he said, well, basically, why do you ask?
And he just told that Eastman is now written and orally
stated that the vice president does not
have to certify the election.
Ludic said at that moment, he knew
he was facing a signal moment in history.
He immediately tells Penn's attorney
that no Penns must certify because the law was clear.
They hang up.
The attorney calls back.
But this time, with a sense of urgency as in his voice,
it says you have to do something either morally or in writing.
They go back and forth and finally,
it's determined that he would do in a tweet thread,
talking about this day and age, of course,
20 years ago to be in the op-ed.
basically was a op-ed within tweet thread,
basically instructing Vice President Pence
he must certify the election, because the law was clear.
Vice President Pence, when he wrote a three-page letter
saying why he had to certify the election,
he referenced Judge Ludic's opinion, stating,
based on Judge Ludic, because everyone in conservative circles
knew who he was, he carried weight.
Based on his analysis, I have to certify this election.
That's how close we were.
That's how close we were, a phone call.
The next day, Vice President Pence called Judge Lutey
the two had never talked.
The first time they ever talked, and he called him and thanked him.
A single moment in history, two men who had not spoken
came together to help save our republic.
Two men who are probably would not have
very little in common with politically,
but apparently we have a lot in common
of wanting to actually make sure
that the American experiment actually succeeds.
And so today we're facing that signal moment in history.
This is not a meaningless resolution.
It is a statement whether you truly believe
in our democratic values that we have struggled to obtain
and struggled every day to keep.
What America could be, she has not been,
but we keep trying.
This resolution has greater meaning
because of the context to it.
Because it is given in the Department of Justice,
which a federal court has already said is lying,
it is given in the Department of Justice
whose persons in that administration
support somebody who literally tried to take an election.
And if it was not before a certain thing,
one of those being a tweet from a federal judge,
that might have actually happened.
It has given them cover.
And the context of today says that this body would agree with it.
And what's interesting about all of this is within this American experience and many
of my colleagues came up last week, we may not have a many come up today, but many came
up last week.
What's interesting about this when we talk about our values as America, those who come
up, many are African-American, many are women, and many are LGBTQ and African-American.
They have received less from this nation than any other group, but historically they
are always the ones that discuss and hope that the American experiment will actually succeed.
They are the ones who are actually consistently fighting to make sure that this country
continues to go in direction that it should.
What also is interesting is where you stand today.
Judge Lutit was appointed by President Bush.
Wilkinson, which I talked about last week, was talked about the fact there would still
be time to save our democracy, was appointed by President Reagan.
Both have sounded the alarms that are very democracy is at stake within this administration.
But look who there were following.
One appointed by Reagan, one appointed by Bush, and although I probably disagree with Reagan
and Bush on almost every political issue, I don't think there's any doubt that in their
heart they wanted a better America.
we could disagree how to get there. Today, in your signal moment, you are choosing to
follow a narcissist, a person who cares nothing about this nation, person who knows nothing
about this nation, person who's never read anything about our institutions and doesn't
care. So we're ludic and Wilkinson followed Bush and Reagan, real patriots, even though
you disagree with them, real people who believed in America, even though you disagree with
them. You have chosen to follow somebody who wants to burn it all down. Today is your
signal moment and that is the choice in the path you follow. Congratulations. Without
out of your world.
Seniors yielded, recognize the center from 26.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I wish I could speak as eloquently as the art deleter talked about this.
history teaches us what we've been through, what we've been through. Let me tell you a story.
When I was 13 years old and the neighborhood I lived in, how were you 49 ran around it?
We used to get a basketball, and under the street like we play full squad, get some sand
and draw full squad, and if you missed hitting the ball in the squad, then the next person
came up.
Well, I got picked up and accused of throwing a brick through somebody's window.
I had a pair of cut off silk circle pants that were blue and white.
The folks said that the person that threw the brick had on striped pants.
If you'd seen the pants in the light, they would look like they were white.
They put me in the back of the car.
I'm 13 years old, little guy gets out of the car,
got in the back seat of the police car,
put a gun in my head.
Call me everything but the child of God.
They stopped me out of hand there and there,
which was about a mile from where I lived.
There was a white crew in there.
We used to stop in there and buy snacks and stuff
and don't try to watch.
Have gone with terrible gun smoke.
A black school teacher was in the store.
Walked out and saw me in the car and scared out of him
because she was scared of the police.
The white clerk that was in the store came out and looked in the car and saw who I was
and told the police, I know that boy here in his family come by the store all the time.
The police made the guy get out the car and they took me back to on the street where
I was, but while I was sitting there crying, my mom and dad had run by the store in the
car running seven days a month now, trying to find their child.
In 1967, I left for your predominately black high school and went to a school called
the Near High, which was a military school.
And when I went to practice, I went off a quarterback and everybody used to park on the side
of the street watching football practice to see whether or not I could throw a football.
There seldom played quarterback, I played everything but quarterback and did it pretty good.
I left high school in 68 and went to a college called Tuskegee Institute.
I wanted to play football.
I used to watch the Lenin movie with the Baltimore coach,
and he will wear spats.
And if you don't know what spats are,
they tape your ankle and the shoe together.
And you look mighty sporty when you're running in the ball
and you're going to touch that.
Well, when I went to Tuskegee, I taught myself
going to play quarterback.
The trainer for the football team was my homeboy.
And he told me, he said, man, don't do that.
The coach told me to pick up your stuff at the practice.
I went to the coach and said, coach, I can't go back on him.
He said, what do you mean?
Look, I said, I can't go back.
He said, what were you going to do?
I said, let me play defense and back.
We had a star running back by the name of Ralph Jenkins, all
S.I.C. He had a pulling guard by the name of truck Robinson
a Mississippi way to about 260 and ran a 4-7 for them. That day at practice they ran
a suite. I hit the guy that was the way I had 260 spending the ride and hit the running
back and drove him over to the bleachers. We used practice on the baseball field saying
coach jumped up in the outblown and said man you're about to kill my running back. I said
coach, you finna cut me. He said, come up now for that practice. I went up to his
office and he gave me a full ride to play football. While I was in school in 1969, I
had a professor by the name of Nenjaka. He was an African. And we had an
an assignment to go register black folks in Barbara Connier, you follow Alabama. And while
I was down there trying to get folks to sign up and register to be voters, somebody
shot a gun. They were in a pickup truck. Almost got looped. The book shots and stuff hit
the side of the house while I was standing up there on the porch.
God back the Tuskegee.
And we were having elections in Alabama.
There was a guy by the name of Fred Gray, who was the lawyer.
And there was a guy by the name of Thomas Reed, who owned what we call the chicken coop.
We used to go in the middle of the night to get some chicken and come back to the dome.
I saw a book and the people who were voting, some who were 100 years old, I took the book,
put it up on my coat and went back to Tuskegee and we had them to look at it and so we had
a special election and read ran as an independent one so they became the first two black state legislators
in Alabama.
Now, I say all of that to tell most of you,
the thought of my little finger will brush your head
while I don't.
You come to Atlanta, Georgia.
FBI, take all the vote of the list
because the president said he won the election in Georgia.
And had it not been for the phone call that the Secretary of State recorded, he lied on him, too.
Ladies and gentlemen, we've got a president that a lot of you in here support.
You don't see it out loud.
But you support him because he couldn't do what he's doing unless he had your support.
And so what I said, the men of you get some intestinal fortitude.
You don't have to be a Democrat.
You work.
His money don't affect you.
You send him money.
That's how he win the election and pay all the lawyers that he's got defending him.
155's. He's smart now. He do everything and start something way in the news every day
about something else except the Epstein 5. Now most of us in here are soon what Trump
already know. Messing with them young girls. And many of you in your got daughters. It had
it been your daughter. I know what you would have done. You'd have had this here. Here's a
criminal, being convicted and ran as president to stay out of jail. To stay out of jail does
not follow the law. I say this everywhere. That is to intimidate folks and keep them from
vote, and change the narrative of the Epstein files for something else. But he is a man
that cares nothing about the law. The Justice Department does what Trump tell them to do.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm a Democrat.
I ain't no question about it, but I do have some dignity.
And as I said before, Donald Trump gets into the pants
the same way David Lucas gets in here.
One leg at a time.
But yet, it's still you come and bring this.
because he's trying to prove at the last election that he
loves was a fast.
Secretary of State, I get a governor credit.
They said that was nothing wrong with your elections.
Then Trump talked about the governor and his wife.
He talked about her.
But what we got to do in this body,
in this body that I serve in with you.
So you can be ever so smart,
but you can't pass a thing unless you got some friends.
in the body. What we're about to do is a lot done Trump to be Putin. When you talk about
eye-sagents, killing folks, that's what Putin does when he has opposition. He take you out.
y'all remember the guy that was going toward Russia and Putin stopped him and the next thing
you know he got blew up in the airplane being a dictator is what dictators do. If it didn't
many of y'all forgot about January 6th. I saw it on television and you trying to tell
me I didn't see what I saw. And then when he becomes president, he pardoned all the
thugs because they did his bidding. And yet y'all bring this to this body about give
all the information. For what? So they can come and intimidate folks, get their names,
because that's what they do. You're scared. Stop being scared. If you're scared, y'all
you're not the run for office. We need folks who will stand up. That's why you got
protests all across the country about this president. He's a criminal. That's
what he is amongst other things that they keep talking about. And he's in it. They
just redacking everything where his name come up because he the head of the
father. Well, ladies and gentlemen, let me say this to you. Get some goods. Get some
good. Do the right thing. That's how you get elected. Many are all aware about the coming
up elections and how folks gonna vote. But most of them think it like me. I don't care who
it is as long as it's a Democrat. You find that out in the public service commission
election. You know, we went to court on that and the judge ruled against us because we
tried to draw districts on that. And they say why? But two Democrats won. That I'll
tell you and send you a message. We're tired. And we're gonna fight. We're tired. And we're
don't fight for what's right. And so to all of you and all my colleagues in here, get
some instant, get some open year. Don't let Donald Trump call you and tell you to do
some of you ask them, hi, hi, get some intentional 42, represent the people that you are elected
by. They are concerned about the grocery bill. How they going to pay the household, how
They're going to pay the cardinal.
How they going to see about the gentleman.
And here we are in the Georgia Senate,
playing partisan politics and acquiesce to a tyrant,
a dictator, a person who doesn't even care about the law.
He's trying to see how far he can go, and what you're going to do about it.
And that's the reason you see all these protests across the country, across the country,
not in a little small rural country, but in big cities, little cities, folks who stay
on the ocean, folks who stay at the Great Lakes, they are tired, and they're telling you
they're tired because every time you see you, the majority of the folks in the protest
don't look like me.
They look like you, the majority of you.
So you ought to get the message when you come time for re-election.
Don't come up and tell the folks what you did when Trump said, jump, you jump.
be men and women with some intestinal fortitude to do the right thing.
All right, Senators yielding.
We're going to have Senators from the second.
Thank you, Mr. President.
This morning, colleagues, we've got Senate Resolution 563, which is an urging resolution,
and I would like to highlight that that's all it does is it urges, but I want to talk
for a few moments about what it's actually urging.
It's urging the Secretary of State to comply with the quest of the United States Department
of Justice to securely produce George's voter registration list and compliance with George's
obligations under the National Voting Voter Registration Act and the help of
America Vodac and the Civil Rights Act of 1960 and for other purposes. But the
problem is what is urging and saying in one part of this resolution is the
juxtaposition because the resolution is asking the Secretary of State to
violate the law. Why? Because in OCGA 21-2-225 and OCGA 21-2-219 it
restricts how voter data and information is to be shared.
And I've sat in ethics committee meetings and been at 7 a.m., they've been at 5, they've
been at 7 p.m., in fact, Ms. President, I got promoted on the committee and showed up
to be the secretary.
And I've been in these hearings and understanding that Eric and how we maintain lists and one
of the reasons we don't maintain our lists with the state of Florida is because they've
got a full sunshine law and that they transmit their voter information by not
obscuring the Social Security numbers but by displaying those Social Security
numbers. However, Georgia law does not allow us to share information in that
manner. And so since we can't share information that's why we don't use the
state of Florida to maintain our voter roles and compare our data to theirs
because of how we protect folks information. Now when we talk about this
resolution asking the Secretary of State to comply, well, we'd have to change state law
in order for that compliance to occur. We'd have to allow for the unredacted version of
folks personal sensitive information to be made public. And I don't know about you, but
I've got information that's online, but I don't want my social security number to be online.
I don't want my information in the wrong hands because it's your personal information.
Somebody can buy house, they can take out a loan, they can do whatever they got your
Social Security number.
But when we talk about how we access this information
and how we should share,
then maybe this body should have prescribed the man
in which we would determine how we would do that.
But then I also read in this resolution
where we talked about the NVRA and the HAVA
and that it states the responsibilities.
I wanna be clear colleagues, the NVRA and the HAVA
do not give the Department of Justice
And unlimited right to demand full vote of files and any format at any time.
And so now we say the Georgia Secretary has refused to comply with multiple requests
for this information and full, and that is absolutely correct because he is abiding by
Georgia law.
And so refusal to comply is not because somebody doesn't want to comply, because we have laws
that say you can't do that.
Now when we talk about how folks break laws and how things go, and if there was so corrupt,
well, we spent a lot of time investigating, finding wills, but we didn't spend any time
investigating Brad Raffensberger.
We could have done a special subpoena the same way you did there if it was serious enough.
We've had time to do this since 2020 if we were serious about it, but this is nothing
more than smoke emirals to make a political point that does not need to be made, but
is about protecting folks' information.
And I want to be clear, the federal government does not run election
administrations, neither does the president, states run elections.
And if we were serious about how elections would be running the security,
then we wouldn't have an unelected, unaccountable board making decisions
about elections.
We don't put people on the pension board that can't count.
So why do we have people on the election board that don't know anything
about elections and how to administer them,
how the process should work.
If anything, we should have registrars
and county boards of elections to be on the board,
to go through the technical intricacies
of our voting system if we were serious about it,
not political pointies, a hack job,
but this unelected, unaccountable board.
And if we were serious about it,
we would put them on the ballot then.
We would make a constitutional amendment to empower them
because right now, in a little small book on my desk,
Elections and the manner in which the information is tabulated and process comes to the secretary of state
That's a constitution officer and I read in that same small rectangular book that said the
Secretary of State was a constitution officer not under the jurisdiction of this body
But this urging resolution is just theater and performance at best and so while we may want to
Urge the secretary of state so I ask you the question if you vote yes on this are you urging the secretary of state the violates George
Because that is the question that I'll leave you with and that's the juxtaposition of what is absolutely fundamentally right and what is fundamentally wrong.
And Mr. President's I year the well I'm concerned about the soul of America and the soul of our democracy but I will say this.
What I think of where we weave when we seek to deceive and what that Mr. President I year the well.
All right, Senator from Sega, I don't worry about your soul, I can tell you that.
Stanley, you almost went to preaching on this right there, I like it.
We're going to have Senator from the 6th.
Well, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen,
I ain't no preacher.
And I don't have help to write speeches, so I pulled out my little AI app, and I put
in, write me a two-minute speech on accountability versus hypocrisy.
It was interesting what came out, very interesting, I'm going to read it to you, it's so
interesting. It starts with ladies and gentlemen. Today I want to discuss the
crucial contrast between accountability and hypocrisy. Two concepts that
influence our personal lives, our workplaces, and society as a whole.
Accountability is the foundation of trust and integrity.
It means acknowledging our responsibilities
and being answerable for our actions.
When we hold ourselves accountable,
we foster an environment of honesty and growth.
For instance, a leader who openly admits
a project failure not only gains respect
type, but also encourages their team to embrace transparency.
This creates a safe space for everyone to learn from mistakes and contribute to success.
In contrast, hypocrisy, it undermines trust, it erodes relationships.
It's the act of claiming to uphold certain values while failing to live by them.
of a public figure, now I've lived a little bit of this, I'm going to admit to that.
Think of a public figure advocating for law enforcement while engaging in harmful rhetoric
over previous weeks, months, and years toward law enforcement.
Or telling my party we should be holding our party accountable, yet not word, one word
from them about three house members from their party being investigated and charged with
pandemic and unemployment for all.
And here we are today, Republicans holding our party accountable.
We're doing what you've asked us to do, but that's still not good enough.
This misalignment of ideas leads to disillusionment and cynicism, damaging credibility and discouraging
those who looked up to them.
The impact of accountability versus hypocrisy extends beyond individuals.
In our communities, accountability can drive social progress while hypocrisy perpetuates
injustice.
leaders who promise reforms but fail to deliver create a disconnect that
breathes distrust among citizens. So how can we navigate between these two?
Self-reflect. Regularly assess our actions against our values to encourage
open dialogue, create environments where people feel safe expressing their
thoughts like we are today. Lead by example, model accountability in your own
actions. In number four, demand integrity, advocate for ethical practices and
challenge hypocrisy. In conclusion, embracing accountability and
and cultivates a culture of trust and connection,
while hypocrisy leads to disconnection.
Together, let's commit to being accountable
and making a meaningful impact in our lives
and in our communities.
Now that was all done, probably stored in a data center
that may or may not get a tax credit.
Ladies and gentlemen, today's about accountability.
Is it a statement?
Yes, it's a statement.
It's a statement about holding each other accountable,
no matter what party.
What is wrong with that?
There was nothing wrong with it last week.
There was nothing wrong with it the week before,
and there's nothing wrong with it today.
Thank you, Mr. President, I yield well.
All right.
Thank you, senator Reagan-Eyes.
14th.
You have to mind what you report, Greg.
Okay, well then my own report should come after.
It's my turn.
I can't wait.
I'm going.
Yeah, I'm going.
It's coming from thirty-knife.
Okay.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Thank you, Mr. President, and good afternoon again, colleagues.
So I rise to speak in opposition to SR 563, and I do so with seriousness, because this
resolution is being offered at a moment of real uncertainty and heightened concern.
This resolution is presented as a review of voter rolls and election records, and let
Let me say from the start that maintaining accurate voter rolls is important.
Confidence in our elections depends on clear, transparent, and lawful processes for list
maintenance.
And Georgia already has those processes.
Our state has a listing laws that govern how voter rolls are updated, how inactive voters
are handled, how challenges are reviewed, and how local election officials manage those
responsibilities.
systems operate every day under state law, under federal law, and under established procedures.
SR563 does not improve those systems.
It does not propose new standards.
It does not add resources or clarity to the work local election officials are already
required to do.
Instead, it layers on an additional political exercise that duplicates processes already
in place and ignores allowing current questions to proceed through the courts.
And colleagues, we cannot ignore the context of last week.
Not only am I a resident of Fulton County, but I serve as the chair of the Fulton County
delegation in this body.
Reports of the FBI activity connected to the Fulton County elections hub and offices
have raised serious procedural questions, particularly when materials are removed from
local custody and taken out of the control and state of the officials responsible for
administering our elections to who knows where.
When records, equipment, or voter files are seized in bulk, 700 boxes at a time, issues
of chain of custody, handling, and access are not minor details.
They go directly to transparency, public confidence, and the reliability of any conclusions that
may later be drawn. And I want to pause here so we can remember that Georgia has dedicated
professionals whose job it is to maintain accurate voter lists, Republicans and Democrats,
lawyers and administrators, career civil servants who do this work quietly every day. The processes
aren't glamorous and they don't make headlines, but they are how elections actually function.
And those professionals need stability and clarity, not additional political crossfire.
In that context, this resolution is simply not the right tool for this moment.
It asks this body to conduct a parallel review of voter rolls at the very time new uncertainties
have been introduced through the actions of the DOJ through the FBI, not by evidence presented
to us, but by the manner in which those materials were removed from local control.
Oversight has a role, but it must be practical and forward looking.
This resolution does not clarify what happened last week.
It does not resolve the questions created by those actions, and it does not strengthen
confidence in how voter lists will be maintained going forward.
Instead, it adds additional political heat
to an already unsettled situation
without improving transparency, accountability,
or election administration.
And I'll add this.
It also does nothing to address the issues people
are dealing with right now.
While we debate processes that already exist,
the people we represent are living in the present.
They are facing higher grocery prices,
rising rents and mortgages, escalating insurance costs,
Health care that's harder to access,
child care that feels out of reach.
They are asking us plainly to focus on affordability
and stability in their everyday lives.
SR563 does not help address those concerns
and given the unresolved questions raised
by recent actions of the FBI,
it does not provide a constructive
or responsible path for oversight at this time.
Let the courts who are already working
through these decisions, figure it out, and do their work.
For those reasons, Mr. President,
I do not believe this resolution moves the state forward
and I cannot support it.
Thank you.
I yield the well.
Thanks, Senator.
Recognize Senator from 37th.
Thank you, Mr. President of the Senate, rise today in support of Senate Resolution 563.
And I want to echo the words of the senator from the 22nd who said that context matters.
Context doesn't fact matter.
And what this resolution is about is about transparency.
The author of this resolution stood here about a half hour ago and talked about how important
it is to share everything he shared, a personal example of how under investigation with a broad
number of people handed over everything, even personal messages, he has nothing to hide.
Ladies and gentlemen, I propose that Georgia should have nothing to hide and when this
resolution we're making sure Georgia hides nothing from full public transparency.
I personally stand in a place, and I'd like to thank Vice President Mike Pence for his
bold and stand on January 6, certifying the 2020 election.
That's where I stand.
I stand with Vice President Mike Pence, because given the information they had at the time,
the time ones they had to certify election, that was the bold high integrity move.
I stand there with many Republicans in making that statement.
where I am today, with integrity and transparency.
But I stand in support of Senate Resolution 563 because this is a resolution truly about
transparency.
Now those who are watching this online or here present with us in the Senate Chamber have
heard some attacks on this, you know, the senators can bring their own perspective and
they would vote their conscience as they see it.
If you read the words, the words on the page of Senate Resolution 563, this is a resolution
of transparency.
Now there may be an effort to twist and contort what that all means.
There may be an effort to try to reframe this through some other words.
Don't be deceived by that, though, read the words on the page.
And read the efforts of this Senate and asking our Secretary of State to share information
with federal investigators.
He should do that because I asked the question.
If we have only valid voters in our system,
what's there to hide?
It's very important.
As a state, if we have voters in our system
that are not valid, who wouldn't want to know that?
Would interests not want to know if there were voters,
They're invaledly registered to vote and voting in our state.
Who would want to hide that?
Who would stand to gain from that?
This resolution makes it clear for everybody that Georgia has nothing to hide.
Ladies and gentlemen, one of the most important principles of our election system
from our perspective is the state control of elections.
State control of elections.
I reject the premise of the federal government ought to have to come in and take over our
elections. It's an important part of our compound republic. Why is this resolution so important
to that? Because if we can't share openly what we do here, if we can't share our voted
data openly for anyone in the nation to inspect that has access to this information, as the
author said, this is not being shared to the public. This is going to be law enforcement
people who will guide, who will guard personal information, so security numbers. It's not
concerned about that, they've already got that information. But if we can't share
openly our voter data, I fear that someday some real tyrant, some true tyrant's
going to come in and try to nationalize our election system, saying the states
can't be trusted, the states can't maintain their local lists, and somehow
someday the federal government might come in and in a true active tier and you
to try to take elections away from our states.
In my opinion, in my belief, to maintain the integrity
of state control of elections, having transparency
of who a registered voters are is paramount
to maintaining that state level independence.
That is paramount to me, and that's paramount
to the voters of Senate District 37.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is an issue
of integrity of voter data.
List maintenance is in question and I think George has nothing to hide.
I ask every member of this body to stand with transparency, to stand with the
perspective of we should share our voter lists with valid government entities to make sure
there's nothing wrong with the data because we have nothing to hide.
share the voter list. We have nothing to hide.
Share the Epstein list. We have nothing to hide.
We can stand together. This legislature ought to be about sharing information publicly.
Because if we care about the voters back in our district, they want to see transparency.
They don't want to have people trying to hide the ball, trying to hide behind their positions and point fingers about things.
They want transparency of public voter data.
because if voters are registered to vote in Georgia,
they're not valid, their vote is undermined.
Their vote is compromised.
Friends, this is a voting rights state.
This is a state we've cared deeply about,
the integrity of our elections we've had.
We've had a lot of attention over the years.
I'm proud that this Senate stands
with openness and integrity,
not trying to hide the ball from anybody,
not trying to play games.
And I think the Secretary of State
should follow federal law, this is not a federal takeover.
In my opinion, transparency protects the long-term integrity
of state control of our elections.
And that's why Senate resolution 563 stands
with transparency and integrity.
That's what I stand for.
That's the context in which I support this.
Not the bogus narratives that you've heard
from some of our members.
That may be why they're opposing it,
So the reason I support it is for transparency so that all voters can see that the work
George has been doing and that we're committed to an open fair election system for all.
No matter where you come from, no matter what you look like, no matter what your zip code
is, or no matter who you vote for, without Mr. President, you'll be well.
All right, thank you Senator, Senator from the second, what purpose do you rise?
It's such an inquiry.
Mr. President, did the heating bill suffer laps and appropriations for anything the
Senate of the 19th may or may not have done in this ice box in the chamber?
So you're seeing your little cold, huh?
Frostbitten.
Frostbitten.
Well, the senator from the 19th is known for being a co-hearted individual, so he might
just turn it on the temperature, thermostat.
Serving from the 9th, and then we'll have the minority report, and then hopefully we'll
finish up here.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I rise today in opposition of SR 563 and echoing some of the sentiments of my colleagues
have already brought forward to this body.
Here we are on legislative day 10 and this is where my Republican colleagues want to waste
time. While Georgians are waiting for us to prioritize things that really matter, while
their needs lay by the wayside, this is day 10 of what we're dealing with, not any real
legislation, an urging resolution, which is not binding, by the way.
No legislation to move the needle on any of the priorities that Jordan's care about.
I know this wasn't on any top of the list that my constituents are asking me for.
Let's follow the path here.
It's been happening since 2021, the set up
to interfere with our elections here in Georgia.
As we know, Georgia, all eyes are already always on us.
Clearly, we run rent-free in Trump's mind.
But let's follow this path.
It was to first Trump asking our Secretary of State to release those voter data.
Was that last month?
In this week, we had the raid, I mean last week, we had the raid on the Fulton County election
office.
Prior to that in 2021, we had a bill, a voter registration, I mean, a voter bill, I call
it an anti-voting bill, that gave power to an election board of a majority of Republicans
to basically go after unperforming counties, county elections, county election boards.
So it's no coincidence that now we have a raid last week on fooling county.
We don't know, we know the budget data was taken, but why was it taken, it wasn't about
transparency called everybody off guard so why so I want y'all to follow here was
happening here's the setup to start interfering in Georgia elections and
Republicans in this body should be concerned they want to sit up here and talk
about transparency and we need to trust you know our election process but right
happening in our faces. The Trump
Administration is setting up to interfere with our 2026 elections. Don't get it, don't get swayed by that.
So we have this petty resolution that we're dealing with today. And I want to be clear,
the Secretary of State is doing his job. He's protecting our data. He said no.
He's an elected official that is given the authority to protect our data and run our elections.
And he's remained clear that that is exactly what he's doing.
And it's funny how the alleged winner of 2024 wants to look back to 2020.
absurd. He can't accept that losing 2020 like he did. He can't accept the loss. And now
we keep relitigating it. And voters are paying attention. And I think the more this stays
out here, people are going to start waking up. And Trump is going to be responsible for
some Republican losses in this next election,
because Georgians aren't happy with these policies.
They see what's happening.
So I find it interesting that Republicans in this body
are co-signing on the possible interference.
The FBI Rating Fulton County Election Office is just one more alarming, terrifying escalation
from this failing administration of a wannabe king deflecting from his economic failures.
People care about grossies prices going up right now.
about housing. People care about being priced out of their health care. And yet we have not dealt
with one bill in this body to deal with any of those issues that people are asking us to make a
priority. State law is clear about what voter data can and cannot be disclosed. And there is no
exception to that law because Donald Trump said so. If Donald Trump wants
Georgia's, Georgia voters personal information, that's too bad because
presidents have to follow the law like everyone else. I'm asking everyone in this
body, including my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, as I, as, you know, my
senator, colleague has said, find some courage. I know y'all are following orders, but sometimes
you have to think, what's really happening here? Would you be okay if they walked up in
your county and start stealing your voter files without you knowing about it.
Let's start looking at coffee county.
That might be where we really need to go and do some investigation because that's really
the only alleged voter fraud that we know we have evidence that happened.
But here we are, Raiden Fulton County as we all know is the largest, one of our largest
counties.
And the move here is to delegitimize the authority of that county's board of elections to run their
elections, and find cause to interfere with 2026. Pay attention, folks. What we should
be doing is queuing up some lawsuits because it's happening right in front of our faces.
The interference in our elections. I'm urging no today, not to protect any party, and
And this shouldn't even be partisan.
But it's to protect Georgia law.
Georgia voters, it's to protect our Georgia voters and the integrity of our elections going
forward with that Ms. President I yield well.
has yielded. We're going to have a center from 35th.
All right. Thank you, Mr. President.
I stand in opposition to SRF 563, and in an effort to be clear-eyed and principle-based,
it is my hope that a Democratic president, that if a Democratic president, say a President
Obama or President Biden, if one of their administrations kind of leaned on our constitutional officers
here in Georgia, leaned on them to find the votes. If a Democratic president, say Obama
or Biden, went around the country and around the world denying the election results from
2020. If a President Obama or President Biden's administration rated one of our counties
voter ballots, I'd like to think that I'd have the courage to also say no in that circumstance.
Integrity demands it.
This is an exercise that I welcome all of you to, which I'm sure you have.
We would just say it as simple as if the shoe was on the other foot.
would you vote? And that can help us know how to vote in these type of situations. It is my hope
that we are not blinded by power, echo chambers, and group think. It is my hope that we move with not
the word integrity but actual integrity. It also means that it's going to come back and be a
challenge for us when a shoe is on the other foot. It is my hope that my fellow Democrats will
see things the same way when we have to make a hard decision to vote that out of line with
with some heavy hitters in our own party.
That's when we'll see what we're made of.
That's when we'll see what we're made of.
God is not mocked.
Now you yield the well.
All right, Senator on the 14th.
Oh, Senator from the 55th, you have your question light on or you want to speak in the well?
No, it's big in the well.
All right.
Come on.
The well is yours.
Ladies and gentlemen, this all goes by, Mr. President, a rise in opposition to 563.
Hopefully, as no surprise.
I rise because I am troubled by our nation.
And where we are, if I have to stand as many that look like me,
who have been kissed by the sun, have become
the conscience of this nation to do what is right,
I welcome the opportunity to stand.
And I want to say that I rise simply because I did not really want to get up here, but
as I look, I don't want it to be said that I stood by when someone is quoting the Civil
Rights Act of 1960 for the proposition of reversing history.
This is preposterous.
You look at what was happening in 1960 when I was walking down the street with my grandmother
in Gryffin, Georgia, when people on the back of a pickup truck screamed out in hurls,
some words that I didn't even understand as a little kid, and I said, who is this disrespect
that my grandmother, calling her an end, get off the road.
This is what was happening in 1960, right down the street,
right here.
I was not, no one of my color was in here.
And you were going to quote the 1960 Civil Rights Act
to take my voting rights act away and me sit down
and be comfortable with it.
I'm telling you, this is 1984 when it
range down when you're doing something called urine and calling it rain, we can't stand
by like that.
So in 1960, it was to strengthen voting rights acts, not to take voting away.
In 1960, we were trying to help people vote.
And here we are saying we are helping people vote by taking voting a right away to intimidate
people.
There is a system to get data.
Can you imagine, is this, am I in Russian now, the democracy stand for something?
You are going to forcefully come and threaten people.
That's where we are.
We have people living in fear.
My colleagues telling me they are afraid that someone is going to primary them if they
are standing for what's right, that's what we have evolved to.
So I'm urging you to not obstruct, to facilitate America being great.
America great means something, means there are people fighting dying in the
water to get to this country because they see it as a beacon of fate of hope for
an American dream. Let that dream remain something. Rome did not die because of
of external forces. It was internal forces. And this is too dangerously, too dangerously
like Nazi Germany, when people refused to stand for what was right. As I quoted the other
day, the pastor who said when the socialists, when they came for the socialists, I did not
stand up. When they came for the unionists, I didn't stand up. When they came for the
I did not stand up and then when I finally when they came for me that was no
one to stand for me and I'm saying to you I'm pleading for you whether it
means anything or not I want you to think about where we are headed in this
country. Dr. King said it. Are we gonna live together? I mean really we are
shooting holes in our own boat. We are no longer number one in in literacy in
America in the world. Our students are not being able to compete with people in
places we can't even pronounce. Is this truly America? Yes, I stand
because we are quoting laws designed to make voting easier and manipulating it to make people
afraid to vote, manipulating it to having an excuse to come in in 2026 and try to take over our
elections. I never thought it could happen. I never thought that the federal
government, which was to protect us, would now be the instigator of taking our
rights away because in 2026, some people are afraid of the results. We are there
now. And there were some people that look like me who didn't want to vote for a
woman who stayed at home. Look at the numbers and I'm gonna call a lot of people
that look like me, call black men. I didn't stand up here to say this but I'm
gonna say it and you can get on me later. If black men had voted at the same
level that they voted in 2020 when they put Biden in, when they elected the first
person of Jewish descent to the Senate, when they elected the first African
American to the Senate one-up, if they voted at the same level, just at the same
level as the population grow in 2024, the election would not have been the same
and Georgia would not have gone the way it went.
It would not have been him trying to convince someone
to give him 11,790 votes.
It would not.
Why?
Because young African men get this message,
my men who are kissed by the sun,
those 50 and under who did vote in 2020.
If you want to look at the numbers, they did vote in 2020 and we elected those people.
But in 2024, only 70% of men of African descent even voted again.
Not talking about the ones that were not registered.
Not talking about the ones who were registered and did not vote.
I'm telling you only 70% of the ones who did vote in 2020,
came back and voted in 2024, on an election
defied about 115,000 votes.
Why is this all relevant?
2020, let's get, it's six years later,
and we're debating over and trying to justify taking an election
in 2026 about what happened in 2020.
Look at the numbers.
If African American men came out last year,
he wouldn't have won this time.
So I stand because we can't call it civil rights
and take away rights.
We can't take it, help America vote,
and help America not vote.
We can't double speech it.
Thank you, Mr. President, because we
need to strengthen voting rights.
I hear there's something across the hall.
First time I heard about it today.
Again, trying to take my voting rights.
Why?
Federal oversight was to protect voters.
And now it's raiding voting voters, a federal government that people are afraid of.
That's what we'd be evolved to.
I'm calling on people of real faith who really believe to come and take your country back
because we're in trouble.
We're in trouble because some of you,
you will vote for this, but I urge you.
Go take a cup of coffee.
Thank you.
Thank you, the well.
Thank you, Senator.
Senator Gio did recognize the sentence from 34th.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Senator.
recognize the senator from the pro-tam.
Thank you, Mr. President.
It's been some vigorous debate here today.
We've got a lot of committee meetings scheduled this afternoon,
so I would respectfully call the question.
Yes, sir.
I think this was the last speaker here.
Senator, you wave.
You wave?
OK.
All right.
So, and we're about to call for you this question as it is.
So we'll call the previous question,
then we'll hear the minority report,
then we'll hear the Senator the author of the bill
will fill a closed debate,
and then we'll be ready to vote, Senator.
So thank you.
You had the minority report, closed debate.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I appreciate the office of the Secretary of the Senate
for helping me with this visual aid.
On your desks this morning you found this very rudimentary chart that I've provided for
all the senators today and I'll just in a second I'll get into what this chart means.
But the first observation I have today is that we all would like to imagine what we would
have done under certain circumstances, whether it's historical events, or maybe it's the
story the Emperor's new clothes. When we read that story in elementary school or
middle school, we thought how ridiculous is it that there's an Emperor who's
naked and everybody in the royal court is pretending that the Emperor has
closed. But I think when you live through modern times like this you get a much
better appreciation for the types of social pressures that could convince a
group of very serious people with badges and pins and ties or formal attire to
to lie about what their own eyes are seeing right in front of them.
So let's start with the truth and let me be very blunt and blunt in a way that I don't
think any speaker here to four has been.
The reason that Senate Resolution 563 is on the floor is because the president of this
chamber, who is standing about six feet behind me, is running in a primary, again, Secretary
of State, Ralph Raffensberger, to be held on May 19th to determine the Republican nominee
for Governor of the State of Georgia.
And that's the only reason that this Senate resolution is on the floor.
Now, that reason is complicated because it bears with it threads of other reasons that
flow through it, such as Donald Trump as a narcissist who is still obsessed with the results
of the 2020 election in Georgia.
And his obsession runs so deep that it's 2026 and we haven't stopped talking about it.
What that means for our state politics is that anybody who is a loyal Trump follower or
acolyte is required to carry water for Donald Trump in every way that he sees fit.
And in this election, that means continuing the baseless conspiracy theory claims that
the 2020 election was somehow stolen or that Fulton County somehow had quote-unquote
suitcases of ballots, the FBI array that we saw is an outcropping of this, this resolution
is an outcropping of this.
And it all it does is pit the Senate Republicans in this chamber against Brad Raffin's
burger for purposes of primary politics.
That's 100% all that it does.
And I think that most people in here,
and the people in the anti-room, and who are checking their phone
over on this side as well, are pretty tired
of the normal political talking points on both sides
of this issue, because we've heard them a million times,
not just today, but we've been hearing them since 2020.
We're very dug in in terms of the political narratives
that are being used to describe the situation.
So I thought it would be best to go to psychology 101.
When it comes to narcissism, you're familiar with the DSM,
which describes clinical psychological conditions
that you can be diagnosed with.
Clinical really just meaning it interferes
with your daily life, right?
All of us are a little bit egotistical
and narcissistic when push comes to shove,
but if you have narcissistic personality disorder in PD,
it means that you are clinically diagnosable.
Now I do not have training as a psychologist,
and I'm not qualified from a distance
to diagnose the president, Donald Trump,
as a malignant narcissist.
But let's just assume, let's suspend your disbelief
for a moment and pretend that Donald Trump
is clinically diagnosable as a narcissist
with narcissistic personality disorder.
In that case, I would humbly submit to you
that Donald Trump functions somewhat like a parent
to elected Republicans.
I say somewhat because obviously you all have your own parents who came from families,
loving or not.
You've walked along path professionally and personally to become members of the Georgia
State Senate.
And so I'm not saying that Donald Trump is literally your daddy.
What I am saying, though, is that for political hierarchical purposes, he functions much like
your father.
In the sense that if he says something and you don't comply with it, there's a risk that
your basic needs as an elected will not be met.
Think about that from the family context, right?
If a parent says, this is the way it goes, and the child says, no, I'm not okay with that.
The risk always looming in the background is that the basic security and provision of
needs that that parent provides will somehow be taken away.
I think there's an easy analogy to be made that in the elected, Republican world, Donald
Trump provides your basic needs at this point in history, or at the very least, he could take
them away.
could threaten you by targeting you, like the eye of Sauron, like a laser to put on
truth social or on Twitter, you know, Senator from the 30th. You've been very bad and
I'm going to laser you and make sure that you get a primary opponent that is supported
by Donald Trump. We have seen this time and time again that Republicans have been terrified
to cross Trump because their basic needs might be undermined as elected officials. And
I'll say more on that in a second because I think we need to unpack what your basic
needs are as Republican elected officials and how Donald Trump actually is
threatening them more than protecting them. But the literature is very clear.
There are three basic types of adult children of narcissistic parents. So what I'm
talking about is in the family context, when you're raised with a narcissistic
parent, there are three personality types that develop among the kids who have
the unfortunate circumstance of being stuck in that environment. They are the
Golden child, the scapegoat, and the invisible child.
I'll go ahead and cover the invisible child quickly
because we should get them out of the way.
They are invisible after all.
The invisible child is the person
who doesn't really fit the narcissist narrative
about what's happening in the family.
They're not useful to the narcissist.
Because see, for the narcissist, everything's about that, right?
For the narcissist, they don't care
about the needs of other people.
All they care about is making sure
that their very narrowly defined needs are met.
The NPD diagnosis has nine characteristics
that float around quickly.
Grandioce sense of self-importance, right?
It's the best, it's gonna be the best you've ever seen, right?
Frequent fantasies about having or deserving.
I don't know, Greenland for example.
Belief in superiority, America first.
Need for admiration.
My inauguration crowd was the biggest of all time.
Entitlement, I can shut down the Kennedy Center
for two years.
can re-destroy the East Wing of the White House and put up gold,
gilded, BS, all over the Oval Office.
Number six, willingness to exploit others.
Every single business deal that Donald Trump did before he became
president and, all the ways, his family has personally benefited,
you know, C. Jared Kushner, from his time in office.
Seven, lack of empathy, saying that places are s-hole countries.
And, you know, saying that, you know, Baltimore is a crap hole or
whatever, you know, just the absolute disregard for the human
beings that live in the cities of the United States, frequent envy, Greenland again.
And also, why didn't I get the Nobel Peace Prize?
I would like the Nobel Peace Prize, and nine is arrogance, patronizing behavior, behaving
the way that snobby are disdainful.
I don't know, like having cabinet level officials buy new shoes, because their shoes weren't
good enough.
Do you hear JD Vance crow about this?
He was gleeful, right?
The Donald Trump forced his guys to buy new shoes because of the optics of their shoes.
This is the President of the United States, folks, that we're talking about.
So I would say, even without a psychology degree, I feel fairly comfortable diagnosing Donald
Trump as a narcissist from a distance.
So now let's talk about you.
My favorite topic here, always talking about you, Senate Republicans.
If you are smart politically, if you are in line with the president's plans for his own
election to the office of governor, which I think almost all of you are, I remember there
were like three of you who didn't endorse the president for governor a few months ago.
And I remember I texted somebody about that.
I thought that was odd and I was worried about the three of you.
But all of you fit the category of Golden Child,
or at the very least you're playing the role of Golden Child.
Now you notice the little Golden Crown.
I did that for an honor of Donald Trump, right?
That's, he loves gold.
Being the Golden Child means something very specific
relative to the emotional crisis that the narcissist face.
The Golden Child is the reflection of the positive,
light-filled self-image that the narcissist has.
I'll say that slightly differently.
For the narcissist to cover up his bottomless insecurity,
his bottomless sense of low self-esteem and low self-worth,
he must concoct at all times a narrative
that he is actually great, awesome.
You could imagine like that SNL speech,
I'm good enough, I'm smart enough,
and gosh darn it, people like me, right?
Your job as Senate Republicans who vote for this resolution
is to help Donald Trump with this quest.
It's to help him reinforce his positive self image.
Now obviously there's a bunch of leaps
that have to happen before you get there, right?
He doesn't like that he lost Georgia.
It's a red state, right?
What a smear on his public image
that he lost Georgia of all places in 2020.
Two cycles ago, really, really embarrassing stuff.
So for you guys, and as Georgia Senate Republicans,
the highest best use of your lives,
your attention spans, your work,
is to help him fill that self-esteem gap,
is to make sure that he doesn't have to look in the mirror
and CA loser.
The scapegoat is Brad Raffinsberger.
The scapegoat is the member of the family
who was raised to take all the blame
for all the things that go wrong in the family.
So let's say, for example,
that the narcissist and the family setting,
you're all going out to dinner, right?
You've got the parent driving, the kids in the car,
and then all of a sudden while you're in the car,
The president illegally deposes the leader of Venezuela
and abducts him and takes him back
to the United States for a trial, right?
Or let's say while you're in the car on the way
to the Olive Garden, the president raises tariffs arbitrarily
that crush small businesses and you know,
cause a lot of economic harm in the country.
Now you guys as the golden child aren't a pickle, right?
Because you have to reinforce the positive self-image
that the narcissist has.
But how do you do that when the facts are so bad?
How do you do that when ice and border patrol are killing people in the streets or tariffs
are crushing small businesses?
And I go, this is just me talking as Josh now, I go to an event for a group in Winnett
County and the leader of that group, which represents an immigrant minority community, says
we were with Kemp, but now we're with Democrats because the tariffs are crushing our small businesses.
This is a challenge for you guys.
What do you do to reinforce the positive self-image of Donald Trump and these circumstances?
Well on tariffs, it's hard.
On ice, it's hard, right?
I mean, you guys came up and gave some fairly circumspec speeches about the ice or the CBP murder of Alex Prede.
You acknowledge we should talk about it. It's tough. That's because your second amendment folks are getting wedged on that, right?
So like, that's much tougher. But elections, you guys are ready to go on elections.
That's been one of your favorite punching bags for the last few years.
We passed SB202, we secured elections, we made them more, you have more integrity.
This is easy for you guys. So this is actually a layup, right?
a Senate resolution that says,
you bad Brad Raffin's burger, you scapegoat,
why didn't you overturn the election, right?
Well, I don't know because it was his job.
Nobody in here had the job of certifying those elections.
And I think if you guys were back into a corner,
many of you would not have taken the Jody Heiss route.
I think many of you would have done the exact same thing.
You would have certified the election results
because it's your job and you've got basic self-respect,
right, when you look in the mirror and you do your job.
But nobody in here had to do that job.
So what did you do?
16 state senators signed a letter that the president of the chamber took to D.C.
Didn't give it to Mike Pence, did leave it in the Uber.
But that letter was a golden child move to say, we've got your back, daddy.
We've got your back, we're going to pretend alongside you that the election was stolen,
and we're going to do tasteful polite trims on Georgia election law
so that we can corroborate your narrative that something is wrong with these elections.
And the scapegoat just gets beat up man why you always doing stuff Brad you know the back seat of the car right come on Brad
Why aren't you going with the team on this one Brad right and you all hate it
I mean some of you personally hate this the Brad reference burger was on the cover of time magazine with his hand up
Right like some defender of democracy and the fact that there are ladies who live in retirement communities in my district
I saw them on no Kings Day. Guess what they were holding no Kings signs because they vote democratic and they love Brad reference burger
And why?
Because there was a bipartisan consensus
that at least at that minimum level,
that Brad Rafford's burger
certified the elections the way he was supposed to.
Because it was his job.
And there are a lot of people who appreciate that.
Now, I'm not endorsing in the primary.
I'm not endorsing Brad.
I'm not endorsing the president of this chamber.
I will be endorsing a Democrat for that race eventually.
But I think it's clear that on the three steps here
to freedom, you can think of this
like three steps to freedom.
This is sort of the most trapped part of this cycle
on the conveyor belt.
Scapegoat is still kind of trapped, right?
Brad is still stuck in the backseat
of the toxic Republican family car.
Brad still has to do messaging such as
a constitutional amendment to make sure
that people can't illegally vote,
even though that's redundant and it's already in statute.
Or Brad Rathansberger supporting SB202,
which limited Dropbox hours and early voting access
and created a right for the state
to take over local elections,
Because, as Brad determined, that's not that bad.
I should just go ahead and sign onto that.
It may not make me a full golden child,
but at least I can stay within this toxic family
and not get completely kicked out.
Even then, I can maybe run as a Republican.
Now, this is not of interest to you guys
because you guys wanna keep staying in office.
Some of you wanna go to higher offices
but you wanna keep being Republicans.
I would humbly submit to you
that the invisible child is happiest as a human being.
The invisible child doesn't matter to the narcissist
and the narcissist doesn't matter to them.
Now granted, it's hard to grow up as the invisible child.
Because the invisible child learns the lesson
that these other two also learn,
which is my needs don't matter.
My voice doesn't matter.
Only the narcissist matters.
I'm gonna say something difficult,
but I think it's true, and I think you need to hear it.
I think that you have told yourselves
that you can continue being dignified Republican
elected officials who can survive the Trump moment,
this too shall pass, and you can go back
representing your constituents the way
that ideally you're supposed to.
We hear a lot in this chamber and in the building
about how George is different.
We're not DC.
We're not caught up in all that partisan hand-ringing.
You know, we can represent our constituents
on the ground level.
To some extent, I think sometimes that's true.
What I think you guys are chronically ignoring
is that every day that this gets worse,
that becomes less true.
Every day that this gets worse,
Donald Trump's narcissism becomes your main objective
and it becomes the impetus for you to,
as I said a few days ago,
minimize, destroy your own voices.
That is actually the real tragedy of this.
I'll say it again.
The destruction of your own voices
and your own public consciences
is the biggest tragedy in all of this.
George is gonna, somebody will get elected.
Somebody will be governor.
The elections I think will happen this year,
although if Trump thinks he can raid
a bunch more local and state offices with the FBI,
then some of that will be in question.
But assuming the elections happen this year,
This too shall pass, we will move on.
Donald Trump will meet some kind of an end
in terms of his time and office,
and hopefully we can go back to our normal lives.
But the damage that you have done
for these last 10 years and on days like today
to your own voices is gonna be very hard to recover from.
And I wanna name a couple arguments I've heard today
that are golden child arguments.
I was disappointed, Senator, from the 37th to hear
that the reason this resolution is harmless
is because what do you have to hide?
I was on a committee in a house
of the center from the 37th, where we address sensitive constitutional rights, such as the
Fourth Amendment, where fed state government officials can't just knock down your door at
your house and take whatever they want. The exact same arguments you heard from the
center from the 37th today could be used to justify limitless search and seizure authority
by the federal government to enter homes. Well, if you don't have anything to hide, then
what's wrong? What's the problem with that? So that's not really a robust argument,
and I think that gets out of this framework.
I think that transparently shows itself to be
a golden child argument that serves only one purpose.
Or what about the senator from the sixth,
the esteemed rules chairman, who ripped out his own voice box
and threw it on the ground and replaced it with a machine?
I mean, it was funny, funny in a quaint or cute sort of way,
but not necessarily funny to his constituents
who want him to have a spine, to his constituents
who want all of us who are elected to come here
and actually stand up for what's true and what's real.
I thought it was one of the most deeply ironic presentations
I've ever seen as a legislator in eight years
that he read a chat GPT speech about honesty and accountability.
He literally said, we need to self reflect.
I was like, thank you for setting up my therapy talking points.
Center from the six, we do need to self reflect and be honest.
And the machine spat out words like match our actions
to our values or have open dialogue
or an environment where people feel safe.
So if you think this is too snowflake,
just consider the Senator from the Sixth Robot,
which said that we need an environment
to genuinely and honestly reflect
and that that's the way to serve our constituents the best.
Or let's go to the author's comments,
Senator from the 29th.
Going back to that mirror speech, the self-affirmations,
I am not a MAGA.
I am a conservative Georgia State Senator.
It has the flavor of protesting too much.
If you have to look in the mirror and remind yourself
that you're something other than a tool
in a Narcissist's toolbox.
So I genuinely have been impressed over the years
with some of the presentations that I've seen
by the Republican majority to alter
or distort the real purpose of a bill for public consumption.
But you should read the internet comment section
if you haven't been recently.
Nobody out there is buying it.
Not a single Georgian is gonna buy
that this resolution has anything to do with anything.
except for that guy.
And as reality starts to close in from all sides,
electorally, morally, practically,
on the failed arguments trying to prop up a narcissist,
you will hear your own voices, the ones you're destroying,
ring more hollow.
You will hear yourself say things like,
your social security number came from the federal government.
And it's already in the federal government's possession.
And let me tell you, if I wanted the white page search you
and put sick a private investigator on you,
your driver's license, your date of birth,
All that stuff is in the public domain, so sit down and shut up, Georgians.
All the constituent emails we got over the last few days about our voter, our sensitive
voter information, not wanting it to fall on the hands of the federal government.
All those people, apparently, according to the majority, can sit down and shut up.
And there are Republicans who are worried about data privacy, too.
But the message from Senate Republicans loud and clear today in this chamber is your data
privacy doesn't exist, doesn't exist at all.
Because it's already out there, it's already all shot, so why not tickle the narcissist?
You can almost imagine at the back of the car nudging Brad.
Come on, Brad, what's the deal, man?
Get with the program.
They already have all this data.
Can you just make the narcissist parent happy so that we can all live in peace?
Brad is doing some good messaging today.
You'll see his Groundhog Day messaging?
Pretty strong.
I genuinely can't believe you all brought this on Groundhog Day.
I genuinely can't believe it.
Because in that movie, is Bill Murray?
Good actor, funny guy.
He wakes up and lives the same day over and over and over again
on February 2nd, and Punxitani Phil, the groundhog,
keeps getting trotted out, six weeks more weeks
or whatever.
And it's a hero's journey, right?
A building's Roman.
Bill Murray has to learn how to laugh, love,
and live in harmony with his community.
And until he does that, he keeps repeating
the same day over and over and over again.
He gets so miserable for him that he throws himself
in front of a train.
He drives a car off a cliff.
He'd rather die a million times than live this day again.
Some of you may feel that way.
Some of you might feel like that nothing is worth
continually tickling this man's ego,
that biggest vote of all time, right?
Like, it can't be worth it at some point.
But anyway, Bill Murray escapes the trap.
Because once he realizes that the power is not worth it,
that the humanity, the basic humanity of the people
in that community that he looked down on,
that that's the most important thing,
whatever powers held him hostage, set him free.
So I guess the message from Senate Republicans
here on Groundhog Day is we are gonna live the 2020 election,
day in and day out, over and over and over again,
until we finally learn the lesson,
that if we really wanna represent our constituents
as well as they deserve,
If we really want to be the people we look in the mirror and tell ourselves we are, then
we have to cut this BS out.
Thank you guys for your time today.
I know.
You do have a long question, Senator.
I'm happy to answer questions.
I know you want to stay in the well a little longer.
I'm happy to answer.
We're going to ask the majority later for a question.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Is the Senator yielding?
I do.
Senator, is what you presented the minority report?
It is.
report of a minority as to a lot of things.
Senator, will you further yield?
Probably as long as you'd like me to.
That's up to you.
Senator, are you running for Lieutenant Governor?
Well, I wasn't going to bring that up, but as a matter of fact, I am.
Senator, will you further yield?
I would.
Is this mockery of a presentation that you presented today
a tryout to earn the support of George Soros or Stacey Abrams?
I don't know if I owned a processing plant
that had a canning line that I could can
a more canned talking point than the one that you just used.
What I will say is that voters want honesty.
They want authenticity.
This is something I actually care about.
You know, 20% of Americans, it's estimated
to have a narcissistic parent.
The likelihood is that up to what's divided by five,
over 10 senators in here probably dealt
with a difficult childhood environment
for which a lot of this hits personally, right?
And it just so happens that there is this template
that exists in a lot of our personal lives
is also extremely useful for understanding
what the country is going through right now,
laid bare.
So if you think this is a mockery of a performance
or whatever it is you just said,
I would invite you to consider the possibility
that this is the truest thing that you've heard
in a long time about Donald Trump
and about your work on election issues
in the Georgia General Assembly.
So I'll defend this stuff till my grave,
and it's really up to you whether you wanna really process
and as the six robot said, create a safe space for self-reflection.
Does the senator further you all day?
Senator, I don't use AI and I write my own stuff, so thank you.
As going back to your interesting comments, do you believe George Soros represents Main Street, Georgia?
What I think is that somebody's calling me, hold on.
I should.
It's probably George.
Yes.
It's probably actually it was a journalist.
What I think the George Soros or Stacey Abrams or any names that we heard today, why haven't
heard a thing about the people across the hall, I haven't heard a thing about, you know,
almost all of those hypotheticals you guys pose, there's a process in place, there's
a process that resolves it, there's an ethics board that assesses a fine, there's a criminal
process that leads to a conviction and a sentence.
That's why we have institutions to process problems.
The problem with Trump is that because of you guys, because of the failure systematically,
for people to raise their voices in opposition to a would-be tyrant, we currently don't have
the institutional strength to check this threat as it currently exists.
And so you guys are playing with live ammunition.
You've been playing with live ammunition for 10 years, telling yourself as the walls have
been closing in that it's never going to be that bad.
But the second amendment groups I think are giving you guys a canary in the coal mine,
right?
Which I didn't know how the second amendment groups would go, but after we saw the murder
of Alex Prattie and we see that the Second Amendment groups are starting to say,
hey, wait a minute, Christy Nome, Cash Patel, we don't want you guys to be saying
that you can't bring a gun lawfully to a protest. That should be a little bit of a hint for you
that some of this, what aboutism? They're like, well, what about George Soros?
That people are going to see through that transparently as a deflection, a move of what aboutism
to distract from what you're really doing, which is what it's really all about.
Senator, are you further ill?
I'm happy to.
Senator, do you believe Stacey Abrams was elected governor?
No, I don't think she was.
I think she lost in a free and fair election.
I think she knows that.
I think we've all been saying that.
So again, it's like, like, you know, I hope Georgians,
I don't know any cameras.
If Georgians are watching this, I hope that you are listening
to the fixation of the Senate Republican majority.
I hope that you're hearing that as the walls are closing in
and Trump is, you know, annexing Greenland and deposing other,
you know, heads of state and doing tariffs
and sending ICE and CBP to terrorized people.
I hope you hear the Georgia Senate Republicans
all they've gotten in the boxes,
George Soros and Stacey Abrams.
Like that's all they've got.
And so if you guys have a better way
to meet this moment than to rehash five
10-year-old talking points,
I will yield for as long as you wanna try.
Senator, I appreciate you being cute with your answers,
but at the same time,
that is the reality of what's going on in the state
in your party and you can continue to deny it.
But we know where you're talking points are coming from and I hope that does help you on your road to lieutenant governor I think you're I think you've carried water extremely well for your daddy
Anybody else
We're going out of center from 56
Thank you miss president with the senator yield I do yield to my colleague from the 56th
Senator, are you familiar with the awful effects of Alzheimer's?
I am.
Senator, are you further yielded?
I do.
Are you also familiar with the terrible effects of dementia?
I am familiar with that.
Senator, are you further aware of the effects adult children can have when their parents have dementia or Alzheimer's?
Yes.
In fact, my uncle is suffering from some of that, so some of this is a fact to be personally as well.
me as well. Thank you for being so genuine your answer. Knowing that the prior
administration was suffering from both of those things clearly and most of the
time couldn't put two complete sentences together I didn't see this same
board up during that time frame when you served in the Senate where we probably
would have seen someone as the caring child that wanted to just be there for
mom or dad or dad in that case and I didn't see the one that said let's just
hide and pretend that that really is okay. So Senator, isn't it a little bit
disingenuous that you are now focusing on the current president yet for four
years and the other one wasn't capable mentally or physically to be in office?
You didn't point that out. Do you know the meme of the dog that's in the room
where everything's on fire and the dog says this is fine? You're familiar with
that? This is like a millennial Gen Z thing. So I apologize if it does the questions
go the other way that you're talking.
So imagine a room's on fire and we're in that room.
And I'm saying, guys, we should get out.
The room is on fire.
This is the equivalent what you're asking me of saying,
you know, last week, somebody farted in the room,
and it was very uncomfortable.
But you didn't want to leave the room then.
So I think it's pretty hypocritical
that you want to leave this burning building now.
That's what I think of your question.
Appreciate the analogy.
Senator, I'm afraid something smells,
and it's coming from the well.
Thank you.
All right. Thanks very much. Listen, I know that this has gotten a rancorist, but we didn't want this. We really didn't want this
But you guys are insisting on it. Thank you, Mr. President
Thank you senator. Seniors yielded the will
We're gonna as the senator's room twenty-nine to finally close debate
Thank you, colleagues. I appreciate the attention you all have given to this resolution.
There I say I'm somewhat surprised, not my intent.
Maybe it's because I carry a DSM-5 in the DSM-5TR in my office and I realize that sadly
to the assumptions of many I'm not a toxic narcissist.
But I have witnessed at least one here today.
It's all a lot of distractions and I mentioned when we first spoke that we would see these
distractions. What the FBI raids in Fulton County have to do with the surrender of records
during a law enforcement investigation? Don't quite understand. I heard a rant about partisan
politics. The last time I checked, the Secretary of State and the Senator from the 29th are
members of the same party. People saying that people do things to want to get elected.
I may want to talk to the wife of the Senator from the 29th because there's a lot of times
I give my opinions at rallies, whether it's about election integrity or other issues that
are not popular.
But I said this the other day, the Senator from the 30th and the Senator from the 29th,
the only unforgivable Senator in our profession is to tell a lie.
You stand up and you take it like a man or a woman, whether you made a bad choice or
whether you made a mistake.
Somebody brought up the fact that here we are day 10 in a real legislation.
I think it was day two.
I stood outside and talked about a will-barrow dump of legislation attacking federal law
enforcement officers.
Day two.
Now day 10, day two, people want to come out in the state to take actions regulating
the policy's procedures and requirements of federal law enforcement officers.
Trust me when I say civics matter.
I heard somebody say that the current president is the alleged winner of the 2024 election.
A alleged winner, let's talk hypocrisy.
The 1960 Civil Rights Act, newsflash, it is applicable to every American, every single
American.
My six-year-old daughter included.
Where people come up here, recklessly throw out Nazi Germany, Russia, throughout what you
will, I'm a proud American citizen, and that last word matters because today we're being
encouraged not to be proud American citizens.
If we tell somebody we're a proud American citizen, then we're disparaging those individuals
who may not be yet, but are working toward that, or that maybe I'm not open enough, or
maybe I'm separating myself, and having forbid I bring up the fact that I'm a proud American
Christian citizen, the same thing.
So the rhetoric I heard, coming, didn't surprise me too much.
And I always hear people run down here talking about, get spines and get guts.
Well, let me tell you, I've been in here for eight years, and I think the first person
that ever stood in this well and talked about the lack of
spines inside this building was a senator from the 29th.
And I still speak of it today because I will tell you,
my daddy left this world 1999 and I don't carry anybody's
water but the people I represent, faith and facts for what
drive me in that order.
And then, for somebody to come up here and talk about somebody looking in the mirror,
I know theater when I see it, and when you do theater, you're there to entertain an audience.
You're there for applause.
You're there to be recognized.
You're there to be grandiose.
You're there to fulfill your fantasies.
And those are the first two identifiers of a narcissist.
So let's be clear.
This simple resolution is to urge Secretary of State to cooperate.
The DA of Fulton County got in the due process, and I got to give her credit there at the
end with a subpoena from the senator from the 46 she showed up.
Secretary of State has been given multiple opportunities to testify in front of our ethics committee.
And our chairman, the esteemed Senator from the 11th, has been over backwards to accommodate
and he has yet to show up.
And the last time I checked, he was elected by the same people that elected us.
And you know what it takes to show up when you're right, when you're wrong, when you're
scared, when you're not sure.
takes a backbone and it takes guts and so I'm going to ask you to support this
resolution don't be afraid of your party you're certainly not going to be
