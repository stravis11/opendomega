It is now time for the morning devotion afternoon devotion.
All senators, please take your seats and cease all conversation.
I would ask that the doorky rescuer the chamber at this time.
I'd like to recognize our rules chairman, the purpose of leading us in our pledge and
introducing our chaplain of the day.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Please join me in the pledge of allegiance to our nation's flag.
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for
which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
And now our Georgia flag, I pledge allegiance to the Georgia flag, to the principles for
which is hence wisdom, justice, moderation, and purge.
Ladies and gentlemen, I've got a treat for you today.
I've got Pastor Chip Gordon with me.
Chip lives right around the corner for me, and I get to see him very often,
because he's out walking, and I'm not out walking,
but I am out driving in my car a lot as y'all can relate to.
but when I do walk I'm usually not very happy and when I see Chip and I see Joe
Ellen his wife when I see them out walking they're both very happy and it just
kind of makes me feel happy and but Chip has a very rewarding job. He works at
City of Hope which is formerly known as Cancer Treatment Centers of America
where he is the director of pastoral care.
He was instantly impressed by them in their mission.
He knew right away that he wanted to be a part of the team.
And since it was purchased,
he has continued to serve patients,
their caregivers and the staff.
And he has done that for the past 15 or 13 years.
He earned a master divinity from Southwestern Baptist Theological
Seminary in Fort Orch, Texas.
and a bachelor's degree in communications from,
I don't like to say it,
Auburn University.
Through, excuse me, it's making me cough.
Throughout his more than 30 years of ministry experience,
he has served as a youth pastor and senior pastor
for various churches in North Carolina, Alabama, and Georgia.
He served as an North American Mission Board church planter,
planning a church in Henry County, Georgia,
at the time one of the fastest growing counties in the US
served on many local boards in Caledity County.
He's born and raised in Noonan,
and he met his wife, Joe Ellen, at Auburn University.
She is a retired mathematics teacher at Noonan High School,
my alma mater, and Chip and Joe Ellen have two daughters,
Katie and her husband, Hunter, Abbie and her husband,
Andrew and four incredible grandchildren,
with one more on the way.
So y'all give a warm Senate welcome to Reverend Chip Gordon.
Well, thank you, Senator Brass and Lieutenant Governor Jones.
What a joy to be with y'all this afternoon.
As I begin, I would like for you to look around
at the people around you, just the people near you.
Look around.
They don't look like you, they don't talk like you,
they don't act like you, they don't have your background.
We are all different.
I love the fact that God knit each one of us together.
We are fearfully and wonderfully and uniquely made.
Now we may not always agree with one another,
but one thing you can agree on is that you are here
to serve this great state and what is to do what is best for the state of Georgia.
And today I would like to talk about unity and peace.
We are told in Psalm 133 1 how good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity.
Romans 14, 19 tells us, let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace.
When you stop to think about it, you are either a peacemaker or a troublemaker.
You might want to ask yourself, am I a spoon in the bowl of discontent?
Do I stir others up?
Well, friends, peacemaking is not always popular.
Unity is not always popular.
Some people prefer to fight for what they believe in.
In a battle, the hope is winning, but someone must be the loser.
Peace-making and unity actually produces two winners.
Peace-making is God's way.
The Apostle Peter wasn't known as a peacemaking kind of guy when we first meet him.
In fact, when we first meet Peter, he was impulsive and strong-willed, but Peter changed,
and he developed some good qualities the hard way.
The Holy Spirit changed Peter.
Peter was now a man that God could use.
Listen to what it says in 1 Peter 3, verse 8,
Finally, all of you be like-minded, be sympathetic, love one another, be compassionate and humble.
Peter lists five characteristics, things we should strive for in order to maintain peace and unity.
We should first be like-minded.
Being on the same page, having the same goals, it does please the Lord when we have unity.
You all agree that you are here to serve the people of Georgia, right?
Okay, hopefully so.
The second characteristic Peter talks about is sympathetic, being
responsive to the needs of others.
And then thirdly, love one another.
We must look at others and treat them as brothers and sisters.
In fact, John 1334 tells us, a new command I give you,
love one another as I have loved you,
so you must also love one another.
The fourth characteristic that Peter talks about
is that of being compassionate.
Everybody needs compassion.
We all need compassion.
At City of Hope Cancer Center,
we want to show compassion through
how we say what we say to our patients.
and sometimes that involves holding their hand,
maybe even giving them a hug.
We all need compassion and let me tell you,
if you have not had a hug today,
you come see me after I'm finished
and I'll give you a hug, okay?
Showing compassion.
And then that last characteristic
that Peter talks about is humility, being humble.
Colossians 312 says,
therefore as God's chosen people,
holy and dearly loved,
clothes yourselves with compassion,
kindness,
humility, gentleness, and patience.
Friends, ask yourself, how can I be a peacemaker?
How can I help establish unity, not just as a senator
in the state of Georgia, but in all areas of my life?
Unity and peace do not come about by us just sitting
and not putting forth any effort.
Too often we think of peacemaking as a passive role,
simply the absence of conflict.
But that is not the case.
You and I must work at peace.
We must strive to have unity.
Peter was quoting David in Psalm 34
when he wrote in 1 Peter 3.11,
seek peace and pursue it. We are all different. Are you going to always agree? No. But when
we seek to live out these characteristics that Peter shared in First Peter 3.8, it will
make a difference and it will bring about unity. Will you pray with me? Lord, I humbly
come before you this afternoon and I ask your guidance on this Senate. I pray for each
lady and man present that you will guide them in all that they do. Protect them, strengthen
them, encourage them as they seek to live lives of peace and unity. I pray they will be
like-minded, sympathetic, they will love one another, be compassionate and humble. Bless
them today in Jesus' name. Amen.

All right, if I could have your attention, I want to call upon the senator from the 41st
to introduce our doctor of the day.
Thank you, Mr. President, it's good to see you up here.
It's my honor today to introduce to you all, our doctor of the day, or really introduce
a few of you all and welcome back to so many.
He's been here a number of years, but this is Dr. Daniel Lopez.
He's a board-certified family medicine physician with the Kaiser Permanente Group and provides
comprehensive care to diverse groups of clients, of patients, focusing really on prevention
and management of chronic medical conditions and their complications.
Dr. Lopez, he's been here a number of times over the years,
so hopefully you've gotten to know him.
If you haven't, of course you can go see him
or Narsjulia downstairs.
He is the proud father of triplets.
They're now 15 years old, so he gets more sleep than I do,
and I'm grateful for that for him.
He enjoys running, mountain biking, hiking,
and the North and Biturge of Mountains,
and practicing yoga.
Without further ado, I introduce to you all Dr. Lopez.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
It's always an honor and a pleasure to come back to the House of the People and serve
our youth serving.
As you know, I'm a proud member of the Permanente Medical Group for more than 13 years and we are
currently celebrating our 40th years in Georgia, serving Georgia communities and Georgia
patients.
The permanent medical group is a unique, you can check a unique model of healthcare delivery
system that probably can tell you we have the highest quality in patient care in Georgia,
the highest patient satisfaction scores and also as well, one of the highest Medicare
ratings.
We have the largest medical group in the state that is physician-owned, physician-managed,
We work for our patients, no for the insurance company.
But I just want to leave you with a little gratitude and I wish you a healthy and productive
lady's sessions.
Work for us.
For doctors like me that want to use to practice medicine with barriers.
And work with our worries that you run into the medical problems.
You're going to be a very good hands.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
All right, we have a very special guest with us in the back.
Senator Shelley Eccles is with us today, so welcome back.
We also have some other special guests today, the Secretary will read a resolution.
Senate resolution 581 by Senator Sigmund of the Fourth and others, a resolution recognizing
January 27th, 2026 as reach out and read day at the state capitol to recognize the power
of reading to young children every day and for other purposes.
Whereas over 1,000 medical providers and staff have been trained in evidence-based early
literacy intervention programs of the reach out and read Georgia program, offering each
child an opportunity to be read to and to learn to read.
Whereas, over the past 12 months, 388,516 well-child checkups,
approximately 194,258 children and families were conducted across Georgia
with pediatricians and providers implementing the Reach Out and Read program.
And whereas, Reach Out and Read is the only early literacy intervention endorsed
by the American Academy of Pediatrics and has the most extensive body of research
supporting the efficacy of the program model with 26 studies supporting its work.
And whereas, now therefore be it resolved by the Senate that the members of this body
commend the efforts of reach out and read to give young children a foundation for success
by incorporating books into the existing pediatric care infrastructure, encouraging families
in Georgia to read aloud together each and every day and recognize January 27th, 2026
as reach out every day at the state capitol.
That completes the order.
All right, the Secretary has read the resolution.
Is there objection to the adoption of the resolution?
The chair here is none, and the resolution is adopted.
I'd like to call upon the Senator from the fourth district to introduce our special guest.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Excuse me, Mr. President, colleagues.
I'm very honored today to introduce Ms. Amy Erickson,
who is the executive director of Rich Out and Reads,
Ms. Carolina Clinker, program director,
Mr. Cedric Forbes, over here, is the development director,
Kim Thomas, program director,
and Leslie Vessel, program director.
Today is Rich Out and Reads day at the Capitol.
The mission mindset and strong business acronym
reflect a deep commitment to the belief
that we must be bold in how we support
Georgia's youngest children.
I also recognize her team, which I just did who are standing before you for their service to families across the state.
The powerful role Peter Attrade care plays in preparing children for success and school and life.
The books on each of your desk and you have two of them and please take them home.
The books on each of the next layers of death today are meant to be shared with the child because reading opens the world to possibilities.
I'm proud that last year, the General Assembly,
made its first direct investment in Reach Out and Read, Georgia.
And we hope to build on that.
We must invest in early interventions that are evidence-based
and scalable to support Georgia's younger children
in the earliest days and stages of development.
Amy, we have for you a resolution signed by the Lieutenant
Governor dedicated today at Georgia Reach Out and Read's Day.
So if you would please ask them to come in.
Thank you so much, Senator Hickman.
For your long standing advocacy and leadership in Georgia.
Thank you also to every member of the Senate who is here today.
For your tireless efforts advancing outcomes for all of us in Georgia.
This is such an incredible personal moment for me right now.
I've been with the organization for 13 years and for 13 years.
I wanted to stand before you and advocate personally for the mission of Reach Out and Read.
So thank you so much for that opportunity to do that today.
We received our first line item last legislative session and we know that there's much more room to go.
We are located in 84 counties across the state and we need to be in all 159 counties from the rural parts of the state to the Metro Atlanta area.
Thank you so much for your investments.
Thank you for your time and dedication.
It's truly, truly an honor for me and for my amazing team
to be here today.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
You
Are there any unanimous consents?
Does any senator waste a rise on a point of personal privilege?
Chair recognizes a senator from the 30 second for a point of personal privilege.
Thank you, Mr. Pro Tem.
Today is International Holocaust Remembrance Day, in which we remember the six million
Jews, along with millions of others who were systematically martyred by the Nazi regime.
This occasion reminds us that we're all part of combating hate and
bigotry, including anti-Semitism.
Unfortunately, we have recent examples of anti-Semitic behavior right here in Georgia.
I'd like to recognize some special guests that are with us today in the gallery.
And the center of 15th is with me because he and I are the liaison's to the Georgia
Commission on Holocaust on the Senate side.
Sally Levine is up there.
She's the Executive Director and Leader of the Georgia Commission on the Holocaust,
Fran Putney is with her Communications Director for the Commission on the Holocaust,
Karen Eisenberg-Jones, the Executive Director of the Georgia Solidarity Network,
Sam Halpern, American Jewish Committee, and Mack Parnell, the Executive Director
of the Faith and Freedom Organization that you're all very familiar with.
Let's give them a warm thank you and welcome to the Senate.
The Senate from the 15th and I strongly encourage you to visit the exhibit on the first floor
that recognizes Holocaust survivors and liberators from right here in Georgia.
It's an exhibit that we installed a few years ago,
and it's quite well done,
and we walk past that area all the time,
but please stop and read it
if you haven't had the opportunity.
This resolution, honoring,
or recognizing the International Holocaust Remembrance Day
came in late, and if you'd like to sign it,
I will be dropping it later today,
so please stop on my desk if you're interested.
And thank you to our guests for joining us.
I yield the well.
Thank you, Senator Chair recognizes the center from the 56 for a point of personal privilege.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I rise today to offer our sincere gratitude to all of the emergency operations folks throughout
our state, all of our public safety professionals,
for reacting to our winter storm so well,
beginning with our governor, our lieutenant governor,
our head of Jima, which is director Lam,
all our emergency managers, your fire chiefs
and their department's police chiefs, EMS 911,
our linemen, our road crews department of transportation.
And while some areas our state felt very little impact,
others got some pretty severe damage.
And it was because of that planning and that reaction
that I'm proud the report that I believe we had,
probably one of the best responses to a public storm
that we've seen in some time.
So take a moment today and find someone
who is involved in that, shake their hand,
send them a note, send them a text, and just say thank you.
I yield the well.
Thank you, Senator.
We do greatly appreciate the men and women and
and all our public safety officials keeping us safe.
Chair recognizes the center from the 40th
for a point of perseverance.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I rise today to tell you the story of a woman
who is eight months pregnant.
She is afraid, she is young.
She is being forced to travel a long distance
so close to her delivery.
She is experiencing shooting pain
through her back and her abdomen.
Wise people advocated for her to stay here,
to receive medical care, but they were not listened to.
So we don't know how the mother and baby are doing.
Sirique Daniela Bretrago Ortiz is a Colombian refugee
seeking asylum.
She was deported from Hart's Field Jackson Airport
in her eighth month of pregnancy,
while experiencing symptoms that could be life-threatening
for her and for the baby.
The flight took off in a rush, preempting the court
from being able to make a decision regarding
Sheree's medical care.
I can only surmise that these officials risked two lives
to hurry her deportation from the United States
because if the baby was born here,
it would strengthen Sirique's asylum case.
Sirique was forcibly removed from our airport.
It was the federal court in Atlanta
that ruled that her deportation be halted
due to serious risk to her health and safety
and that of her unborn child.
We passed a law in this chamber
that forced a Georgia woman
being kept alive by machines
to give birth to a baby
because that baby's life was so precious.
But we willingly risked two lives,
mother and child to force a pregnant Colombian woman
seeking asylum to go back to her country.
Shame.
What's wrong with this picture?
Does it bother your soul?
Jesus would say that all life is precious, whether it's Samaritan, American, or Colombian.
As we await news of a simple birth from a refugee mother in danger, a story so similar
to Mary.
I pray for Sirriq Daniella, Britrago, Ortiz, and her baby.
I ask that light be given to those who sit in darkness
and in the shadow of death, and that we find our way
to peace.
Amen.
Thank you, Mr. President.
All right.
Chair recognizes the center from the 14th
for a born and personal privilege.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I was at dinner last week, and I was sitting next to a Democrat.
And I was talking about you guys.
I was telling her about Senate Republicans.
And I told her something she didn't expect, which was, do you know most of these guys
think that Donald Trump is unfit for her office,
the vast majority of them think that he's a lunatic
or a narcissist or something like that.
And she said, you're blowing my mind
because for her, what she sees on TV, what she sees in the news,
you guys are some kind of like cartoonish evil villain, right?
You guys are pro-Trump, MAGA.
Of course, that's why you win your primaries
because you communicate that very well.
And you come here and you're just all aboard the MAGA train.
And what's interesting about that, the crazy thing about that,
is that assumption that you guys are super MAGA in your hearts,
that you actually like Donald Trump and support him,
is not just an easy assumption for her.
It's actually an easy and comfortable assumption for you.
You are comfortable with the idea that she thinks
that you are crazy like Trump.
And the reason is because it allows you to draw very clear lines
and stay very comfortable and safe from the fray.
You get to say, well, those crazy Democrats, they don't know.
They don't know these far left loonies that I actually have,
a more subtle and complex approach to this.
They don't realize how hard this is to manage my relationship
with my base.
They think I'm some cartoon villain and I'm not.
I'm a principled conservative, a Reagan conservative
who just wants lower taxes.
And I hate all this Trump stuff,
and I'm waiting for it to blow over.
And if only she knew that,
then she would realize the truth.
To be her villain is much easier for you
than confronting the fact that you still have a voice.
I think this is the hardest part of being you right now
is that for 10 years,
while Donald Trump has showed his cards,
that he was gonna invade cities,
kill people in the streets,
with untrained agents that he's paying $50,000 bonuses
to to rev up his numbers really fast.
We've always known that he was capable of that,
but for 10 years, a series of rationalizations has enabled you
to stay quiet.
Rationalizations like, it could be worse.
It's not that bad yet.
The water's not boiling around the frog,
so it could be a lot worse.
Number two, I have to win my election,
And if I don't win my primary, somebody much worse
will replace me.
One of my friends from Pauling County in the house once said,
if you don't elect me, it'll be a Nazi, a literal Nazi.
So you guys are comfortable in your feeling
that you're as good as it gets.
You're also comfortable with the rationalization
that even if you throw your body on the grenade
and you speak up, oh, I'm going to be noble.
I'm going to say the truth.
Well, you get replaced and it doesn't do anything.
And so we're back to square one anyway
because your voice doesn't matter.
I think this is a tremendously sad thing
that you guys are going through
and that you have gone through for years.
The diminution, the destruction of your own voices,
your own public consciences, not your private conscience,
but your public conscience.
The one where you say out loud what you really think
is happening.
And when people talk about the platitudes of speaking
with your grandkids remembering where you were
when this all happened and what you said
or what you didn't say, that's what they're talking about.
Is did I say something would it matter?
Did I say something when a law abiding gun owner
was murdered in the street by a handful of ice agents
all at once when he had no opportunity to comply
with their orders before they wrestled him to the ground,
took his gun away and then shot him multiple times
in five seconds.
Now, you're lucky because the people of Minnesota and Democrats and others,
independents, are raising their voices instead.
So, right now, you may feel like you don't have to.
But I'm only in politics as of 2017-2018,
because I was diagnosed with Trump during engagement syndrome,
because I felt like I did have to say something.
But again, as the water continues to boil and the frog spins around,
unconscious of its future fate, apparently.
Just remember that somebody's voice has to be raised
for this to stop.
Somebody's has to.
And it may not be yours.
But I ask you what that does to you.
Not the country.
Today, I'm not even talking about the country.
We're about the well-being of my colleagues.
What does it do to you to spend 10 years, 15 years,
telling yourself day in and day out
day out that your own voice doesn't matter and what then will that do to the
country? Thank you, Mr. President, I yield.
Chair recognizes the center from the twelfth for a point of parcel privilege.
Good afternoon, colleagues. I stand before you this afternoon with a very heavy heart
to honor the memory of Mrs. Bernadine Span and her 13-year-old daughter, Jalia Span,
were killed instantly in a tragic car crash by a drunken driver. And also the
death of Jackson span, age seven, who succumbed to his injuries several days
later. Their lives touched many. Their memories will live forever. Will you please
Please stand and pause for a moment of silence as we pray for the span family of Randolph County.
Thank you.
Senators ask for a moment of silence.
Thank you, colleagues.
Chair recognizes the senator from the 28 for a personal privilege.
She's going to do it from her desk.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Tomorrow is Saving Lives Day at the Capitol.
Many of us have been working to make sure that we do everything to keep our community safe.
And several bills have been introduced in some past.
Tomorrow we're going to highlight the one is the Autism Alert Act in Erick's ID law.
And both of them are to help autistic young people.
And one is personal to me because my grandson is 15, almost 16, six to big guy look like
a man.
And I know that he's on the high end of the spectrum.
But sometimes he gets nervous about something.
for police stopped, the car he was in,
he might start frilling his hands
and might end up dying or pulled out of the car and beat up.
And that is happening here in the state of Georgia.
So that is one of the bills
and the other one is a high-speed chase bill.
So I want to invite everyone to look at these bills
and many of us that are here to save last,
like the DUI laws that we passed already
and the senators just talked about three people dying.
And I lost my son to a drunk driver,
so of course you know I'm always trying to do things
to make the streets safer.
So tomorrow it's on your desk already.
We'll have a press conference,
we'll have a room with food in it, food, food.
So please come by and give us your opinion
what this legislation means to your community as well as if you have a bill so we can add it
to our saved lives package. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you everyone for listening. I yield
the will. Thank you senator. Chair recognizes the senator from the 29th for a
of Point of Personal Privilege.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Colleagues, I stand up here to remember coach Tony Dmitry,
the head coach at Harris County High School,
former head coach at Russell County, Alabama High School,
extremely successful baseball coach from Waverly Hall, Georgia,
in my district.
Coach said the high school I graduated from.
It was a teacher, an incredible athlete,
a graduate of a Jordan High School in Columbus, Georgia,
and the father of two.
He was killed this weekend in a side-by-side
rollover on private property while out riding
with families and friends, leaves behind a devastated
student body at Harris County High School.
He was involved in all the lives of the children there.
He was looked up to as a mentor,
as a father figure to some,
but as a coach and friend to all.
So Mr. President, I ask,
if it's the will of the Chamber
that we stand for a moment of silence
and members of Coach Demetri.
Senator, I ask for a moment of silence.
Thank you, friends.
Thank you, Senator.
Chair recognizes the center from the 35th for a point of personal privilege.
Thank you, colleagues, I've come before you today, I didn't originally plan to speak,
but I wanted to share with you that our goals matter, but our methods and our route toward
those goals matters are just as much.
We know that we want the rule of law.
We know that we both are in parties and we have certain things that we want to see with
immigration, with gun safety, with protecting all of our constitutional rights.
But I just want to share with you all that our in-game, it matters.
But the route that we take, the methods that we take matter just as much.
So I ask all of you that as we think about what's happening in Minnesota and we think about
what's happening all over this country, we may agree or disagree on the goals, but I bet
that we can agree on methods and let us seek out those areas where we do have agreement.
And I think that we can agree that human life matters.
So let's find those routes, let's hold onto them because outside of these walls, we live
in a society that's ready to just rip at the seams.
Folks are ready.
People want fracture, people want division because people are angry and for good reason.
So all I ask is that we seek out where we have that common ground.
And from everything that I've learned, from those that I've met over the last few weeks,
is that we agree that our methods matter just as much as our destination.
Thank you so much.
Thank you, Senator.
Chair recognizes the Senator from the 38th for a point of personal privilege.
I'm hoping that one of our colleagues from the other side of the aisle would join us
and speaking up for Alex Pretty and what occurred in Minnesota.
As my colleague from the 35th just shared,
we can have an end goal in mind,
but we all can agree that the methods that are being used
to get to that end goal are not right
and should be used in a way to honor American lives
and not take lives in the streets of our cities.
I also rise to speak out against a sitting congressman who, in the face of what is occurring
in Minnesota, had the tone deaf goll to call for more ICE agents to be released on the
streets of Atlanta.
This is a congressman who is seeking to represent this whole state in the United States Senate.
And so as a state senator, I am hoping that one of my colleagues will join from the other
side and joining us in condemning what is happening in the streets of Minnesota.
And saying we do not want that to occur in the streets across the state of Georgia.
And so my hope today colleagues is that we will honor Alex Pretty's life, a VA nurse,
someone who was holding a cell phone in his hand, someone who's gun was taken from him
prior to being shot multiple times,
someone that was trying to protect a woman in distress.
And so my hope is that we can join together
and say enough is enough.
What is happening from the direction
of what is coming out of Washington has to end.
We should not have cabinet officials
lying to our face as we see what is occurring
in plain sight from multiple angles on video.
Alex was not posing a threat to anyone, he is not a domestic terrorist, he is someone
that saved lives, not that was trying to take away lives.
And as someone who represents this city, I condemn the idea of a sitting congressman
to call for more of that to occur here in our city.
We do not need more ICE agents on the streets of Atlanta or across the state of Georgia.
With that, Mr. President, I yield.
Just as a reminder, colleagues, we don't allow appalls from the Chamber or the Gallery,
just as a reminder there.
Chair recognizes Senator from the 34th for appointing a personal privilege.
Thank you Mr. President.
I stand with you colleagues in solitude with Alex from Minnesota.
He was a 37-year-old nurse, caring for our American veterans at the veteran's hospital.
And me being a 30-year Army veteran, it hurts my heart.
He was a lawful gun owner, peaceful.
He was attending a public protest.
He was defending a woman.
He was shielding her.
The Trump administration said he was dangerous.
At the end of the day, colleagues, I just
want us to remain peaceful, regardless in a red state or blue
state.
We expect the federal government to protect our rights
at all times.
Thank you.
Chair, recognize the minority leader
for appointing personal privilege.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Quick question will be that everyone will ask
over the years to come.
will be where were you at?
Where were you during these particular times?
For years, those on the right insisted that
using having an opportunity to own a firearm
was not meant just to protect a person in their home,
but it was really meant to have protection
against government tyranny.
When we heard that for years and years,
that that's what it was meant for.
And it was not meant to protect government tyranny
when the person was just being silent
or when they were protesting meekly.
It was meant when a person actually may have had a loud voice,
when a person might actually try to protect somebody,
because it was felt by those on the right,
that if you really are insisting
that this government is doing you harm,
if you really are insisting that the government is doing wrong,
your voice may raise, you may protect somebody,
it may not be as neat and clean as people may want.
But that is what democracy is about.
And what they were claiming was that their fear was,
And if the voice was raised or if it was not neat and clean and just sitting back real
meekly and just quote unquote protest in the silence, that then the government would
use force against them.
And of course, most of their vision was that that's forced to be used by some left wing
administration.
But that is exactly, unfortunately, where we're facing today.
a government now that is using force, deadly force,
to enforce its ideals of what it wants this nation to be.
And yet, unfortunately, there are those who are conservative,
those on the right, those on the opposite side who sit silently
and do not say this is exactly what we have been saying
for years, and that I want to fight against that.
Instead, they don't say anything.
And in fact, as I said, the principal question,
or be answered is, where were you?
And there will be those who say, well, wait a minute.
The person maybe said something loud,
or the person got a little bit,
what they think is out of control.
But I would then ask you this, this weekend,
all over this country, at different little locations
and clubs, people were getting loud, people were yelling,
people were screaming, people were using
profanity at deputies, and no one got shot.
Because they're there actually to enforce the law.
And they are there to just make sure
things go smoothly.
And they understand what they're really there for.
But what we're facing today is not that.
What we're facing today is an organization
led by this administration that is there
to actually clamp down on democratic values.
And so therefore when a woman maybe says something
they don't like, they push her.
And so therefore when someone then tries to shield her,
they're murdered.
Because this is not about keeping order.
This is now about tyranny.
It is now truly about destroying
the democratic process.
In this process, started 10 years ago
through trying to steal an election.
It has continued now through kidnapping American citizens
or those who are here legally.
And now it has continued to the very death
of the United States citizen.
And so the question that I started off with
will be the one that will be asked of you.
Where were you?
As people asked, where were you during
when Kennedy was shot, where were you in the moon landed?
They will ask you, where were you
when democratic values were destroyed,
not by outside force, but by an inside force,
by the administration that was duly elected supposedly,
here in the United States.
Where were you to stand up?
What did you say?
What did you do to stop it?
That's the question.
And so today, myself and my colleagues say,
we are here to stand up.
We are speaking out against it.
The question becomes, where were you?
Thank you, and I will yield the well.
Chair calls on the senator from the 37th for a point of personal privilege.
President ladies and gentlemen, the Senate, I stand before you today, joining with millions
of Republicans around the country and in Georgia whose hearts go out to those who've lost
their lives in civil violence.
Our heart goes out because in the very, very difficult work that's done across our communities,
passions are very high.
The heart goes out to those who've lost their lives, those who've also losing faith in
the democratic process because they believed in stories and narratives and reports of the
truth is this way or that way or it's his truth or my truth, there's confusion.
I wanted to say that Americans don't want chaos in their streets.
None of us do.
These are real lives that are lost.
These are real property that's being damaged in these communities,
whether it's lives in Minnesota,
or whether it's lives that are lost in the southern border,
or in other communities around the United States.
These lives are real, they matter.
All life matters.
I share this because this is not a partisan issue.
People who have all political backgrounds care about their families, care about their
streets, and care about their rights.
We've gotten emails from folks over this past weekend, over this past weeks, pointing
specifically to the circumstances in Minnesota, and these are significant circumstances.
I will tell you personally, as I've shared with some of my constituents, I do believe
that citizens ought to be able to videotape things that are happening in their communities.
I believe if something's happening on the street,
and I'm a citizen, and I'm in a public place,
I'd be able to hold my phone up and videotape it.
That's one of the difficulties that our law enforcement face
when they do their jobs.
They're always on display.
You know, when our grandfathers were fighting in wars
overseas, they weren't on camera.
But as we know, Gen X and millennials and Gen Z
that have been fighting wars around the world
of the last 30 years, CNN cameras are over their shoulder
while they're fighting and winning our nation's wars.
That's the law that our law enforcement officers face as well.
I share this because any responsible conversation
about this starts with discussion of the loss of life.
Full stop.
There's nothing that I could say or anyone else can say that's
going to minimize the importance of that.
And to say that, in context of a country where our laws and our citizenry have also looked
the other way, or there's a desire for many of our citizens to look the other way on
enforcement of our most basic laws in our nation, and we've seen a professional demonstration
class that goes law enforcement officers, that provokes law enforcement officers, that
lifts up the rejection of our nation's laws and suggests that law enforcement officers
that are doing their best with the best decency they can enforce our laws.
Because you're any member of the State Senate who would like to be a federal law enforcement
agent who's called upon to enforce immigration laws.
Anyone here want to do that job?
Would anyone step in, subject yourself to being videotape, your face being posted online
for enforcing immigration laws so that you and your family could be targeted for detaining
people who are in this country illegally, who knowingly.
And for years have violated international laws and are turning their nose at it.
Is it okay that we can have tens of millions of people in this country who are not in this
country illegally that we're funding with our tax dollars and we're providing this threat
of protection across our culture with our own resources?
We're a nation of immigrants.
We welcome people from around the world who follow the rules.
The immigrants who I know personally, who went through the process in the years of difficulty
to go through the process to get to the states with their green card and apply for citizenship
and after a course of six or eight years, in some cases ten years, become American citizens,
they care about the enforcement of our laws more than any natural born person I know.
So as we recognize the loss of those in our country who have tragically died in law
enforcement encounters. I want this Senate and all people of goodwill to also commit
themselves to enforcement of law, that people who violate our borders and in our country
illegally simply can't stay forever. Senator, your time's getting back to Mr. President,
I share this on behalf of a number of our colleagues because the issue is real, but
I also call for our colleagues to stand equally by to stop chaos and
the provocation of law enforcement who have a very difficult job.
And let's redouble our efforts also to the enforcement of our nation's laws,
as we affirm the value of life, because we can do both.
Thank you.
Chair recognizes Senator from the 39th.
Thank you, Mr. President.
For the last several days, many of us watched the tragic killing of Alex Pretti in Minnesota.
It's a situation that has raised serious questions nationwide about public safety, constitutional
rights, and the narratives we tell the American people.
For years, we've been told that good guys with guns make communities safer, and yet when
a lawful gun owner is killed, and the justification from the White House appears to be the mere presence
of a firearm, it should force all of us to pause.
Regardless of where we fall on gun policy, every American deserves clarity, due process,
and truth, not shifting explanations after life has already been lost.
We have introduced SR 605 and I look forward to passing that tomorrow so we can all say
unequivocally that we protect the gun rights of all Georgians.
Thank you.
Chair recognizes the center from the 36 for a point of personal privilege.
Good afternoon, colleagues.
We're facing a grave moment in this country.
We are being asked by the administration not to believe our eyes when we see, in the case
of Minnesota, two people within the span of less than two weeks, the shop, co-blooded murder.
But we're asked by the administration to believe a tale, a false narrative made up and coming
out of the mouths of cabinet members that Alex Freddie was a domestic terrorist, shame,
shame, shame, and it is time in the spirit of the remarks that several people have made
from the well today.
It's time to take a stand.
It's time to take a stand.
How long are you going to continue to posture that this reign of terror coming from this
administration is somehow normal and acceptable and within the bounds of appropriate behavior?
How long are we going to do that?
We saw the first amendment and the second amendment torched on the streets of Minneapolis.
We saw an intensive care nurse highly trained to care for veterans in intensive care.
Shot down and cold blood.
all happened and he was dead, you know, 25 seconds after the video started running. We're
faced right now with a situation that inarguably tells us and shows us that the administration
is putting armed masked men and a few women, I'm sure, unidentified without names or without
agency identification and allowing them to run a muck, what could go wrong? Well, we just
saw what could go wrong. And there are many, many more stories that don't rise to the
level of press coverage that we've heard of. People being dragged out in the yard in
their underwear. I mean, just, it just, it goes on and on and on. You heard the story
from my colleague from the 40th, a woman within a month
or less of delivering a baby, being yanked on a plane
and shipped out of state, out of the country,
back to Columbia.
So we're not imagining this.
This is not some fever dream.
This is, we wish it were.
We wish it were going away.
I say each of us, it's time to say, stand up and say, which side of history are you going
to be on?
I watched and participated as a committee member of the Ethics Committee before we went home
last week, a resolution that was an attempt to strong arm our Secretary of State to come
testified why he didn't break the law for Donald Trump when they wanted our voter roles
unredacted, sent up to the Justice Department.
I watched the majority party vote that way.
This morning, ICE opened up operations in College Park in my district.
They sent out 75 unmarked Chevy's Tahoe SUVs out there scouting.
So it's only a matter of time before you face it right here in our state.
And I will say to you, we have Senate Bill 389, Senate Bill 390, and Senate Bill 391,
where all bills introduced and pending have had no action on them from the majority party.
In this chamber, that would curb these excessive behaviors that we have seen.
We call on you to bring those bills to light and we call on you to pass SB 605, at least
bring it up for an open debate.
These are grave times we are all called on what standard we are going to take.
The guy running for GOP candidate in Minnesota just said I can't stay in this party any longer.
I can't look my daughters in the face and tell them that and he withdrew from the GOP candidate
for governor.
Watch closely, think deeply.
The time is now.
Thank you.
I'll leave it well.
Chair recognizes the center from the night.
Thank you, Mr. President.
As we have been witnessing the tragedies that have happened in Minnesota, I'm asking
my colleagues, my Republican colleagues, what's the bridge too far?
with the silence. We have the armed terrorists paid for by the Trump administration with our
tax dollars and our money. We don't know who these folks are. But I know they're terrorizing
our communities. They're terrorizing the communities in Minnesota. We've seen these type
of lollest terrorists before. They just wear different hoods. The ones we knew were,
they wore white hoods, dragged people from their house.
decided they were going to take the laws in their own hands and here we are. When is
the bridge too far? I keep looking for it. It wasn't the murder of an unarmed woman.
That wasn't too far. That we all saw with our eyes and that Republicans in the Trump administration
is telling us that we did not see and now we just hit a new bottom. That would just murder
the man, not shot one time, ten times. For trying to give aid to someone who was legally
protesting, we see this with our own eyes and yet my colleagues on this side are out
are staying silent. We have a U.S. congressman, a Republican who is defending these actions.
When is the bridge too far? You guys keep getting up here and you know, you keep saying,
you know, I hear from you all the time you're the party of law and order. This is not law and order.
Locking up five-year-olds is not law and order.
Murdering an innocent man and an innocent woman is not law and order.
ICE is not even supposed to be going after American citizens.
Did y'all know that?
That is not what homeland is supposed to do.
There's supposed to be protecting Americans.
Yet here we are.
We have an administration that is getting free reign
to ruthlessly murder an American citizen's, too.
And yet you all stay silent.
We have several pieces of legislation on how we can protect Georgians here.
We dropped at least three.
I haven't heard any of our chairman assign them to a committee.
I mean, they've been assigned a committee, but I have not heard when we're having those
hearings.
You know, bills like just making sure we know who these mass gentlemen, these mass men
are, I want to say gentlemen, these mass murderers are, who are they?
You know, I was commenting to my husband the other night and I said, you know what?
Anybody right now that has an ice uniform on and say their ice come knock on our door
and just drag us out and we have no idea who these people are.
Taking people off the street.
We have no idea.
accountability. We have a legislation here we can protect
Georgia's and yet none of my colleagues have supported us. We have SR605. Please
let's pass that resolution. Let's pass it today. Can we pass it today? But if we
We could support us in it.
Let's show Georgia that we can do real bipartisan work, that we do care about our citizens here,
that we do care that we have the possibility of unchecked thugs going around our streets,
murdering and snatching people and we can do what we can here in the state of Georgia to
protect Jordan's.
What's that, Mr. President?
Your time has expired.
I yield the vote.
Chair recognizes the center from the 5th or point of parcel privilege.
Thank you, Mr. President, dear colleagues.
For decades, we have said in this chamber, and heard every single Republican defend
gun rights as a protection against tyranny.
Now, someone lawfully possessing a gun
has been killed by the federal government.
We always hear, don't trade on me.
We have been trade on.
The president defended this murder solely
because someone has a gun.
Tomorrow, we should pass SR 605 on consent calendar
to show we all support protecting constitutional rights,
including right to bear arms.
Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the well.
Chair recognizes the majority later for a point of personal privilege.
Thank you, Mr. President.
As my colleague from the 37 said, the last few days has a minute tragedy.
Alex Pretty was his life, that is a tragedy.
But I like to remind my colleagues that life in all life is important on all days, not
some days.
None of you were there in Minneapolis.
The review should take place.
We should understand the facts.
And I will say I allow that the government must be transparent, honest, until the people
would happen.
But at the same time, sewing chaos is not appropriate.
Chaos we've seen in so many times of our history has created tragic events.
Teaching our kids to be chaotic beyond talking creates chaos even in their lives and their
schools.
So for people to come down to the well to share your thoughts about the loss of life,
I think is completely appropriate and we should talk about Alex.
But to come down here when you weren't there, just because it was on social media, because
it was on video, for whatever it is, until there is a review and the facts come out that
the public transparently sees with their own eyes to hear the entire story.
I think it's going a little bit too far.
And then let's talk about the irony, my colleagues,
that want to come down here and talk about,
what is the definition of a lawful weapons carrier
in protecting the Second Amendment?
The Second Amendment protects our God-given rights,
and in this body to confirm those rights a couple of years
ago when we passed bills to protect that right as Georgians.
And in this state, related to the Second Amendment or other things, this state and even
Atlanta's leadership in law enforcement have handled emotionally charged situations properly.
So we talk about Alex and we talk about lots of life from the minority party.
Let's also talk, let's not forget about having correct law and order.
Let's talk about enforcing the Constitution.
If you're unlawful and breaking the law, you should go to prison.
like the individual who killed Lincoln Riley then nobody wanted to say her name. So as I
close, the loss of life is very tragic. But the politicians, they want to run for president
and go to Minneapolis, DAC like they were there from the minority party, the ones that
want to run for U.S. Senate and ask for an investigation and review the facts that's
going to happen anyway is completely irresponsible.
Let's show up for Georgia and let Georgia continue to lead the nation, Mr. President, I yield.
Chair recognizes the senator from the 7th for a point of personal privilege.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I rise today to speak about public safety.
and our broken immigration system.
We've been told the same lie for generations.
Give up your rights and we'll keep you safe.
Trade freedom for security,
trade privacy for protection,
trade due process for order.
That lie has never kept us safe.
It has only made the government more dangerous.
I grew up in a family that knows exactly what happens
when people in power decide your rights are optional.
My parents came here because America
was supposed to be different
because here the law is supposed to protect you,
not hunt you.
The Constitution is not a slogan, it is not a prop,
it is not a suggestion, it is a shield,
and when the government shatters that shield,
people get hurt.
Public safety does not collapse because people demand their rights.
It collapses when the government decides it can ignore them.
So let me be very clear.
I demand justice for Alex Freddie and Renee Good.
ISIS lawlessness is no longer debatable, deniable, or defensible.
What we're watching is state-sponsored cruelty carried out under the dishonest label of enforcement.
And I'm sorry, if you watch those videos and cannot see that these people were not fighting
back, that they were murdered by these federal agents, then you need to get your eyes checked.
Over recent weeks and months, federal immigration enforcement has crossed a line.
At the insistence of the Trump administration, we have seen tactics that resemble paramilitary
operations in neighborhoods, at protests, and around families.
Let's stop pretending this is about safety.
It isn't.
It is about control.
And here's the truth, they don't want to say out loud, these tactics make us less safe.
When people learn that speaking up gets you targeted, they stop speaking.
And communities learn that calling for help puts them at risk, they stop calling.
Witnesses learn that being present can get you killed, they stop helping.
That is not law in order, that is fear as policy.
We just saw a 37-year-old ICU nurse, Alex Petty, who cared for American veterans,
murdered by federal agents during protests tied to immigration enforcement.
And instead of accountability, this administration called him a terrorist.
Then they tried to justify his killing by pointing to the fact that he lawfully possessed
a firearm that argument is obscene.
If protesting is enough to get you killed, the first amendment is dead.
If legally carrying a firearm is enough to get you killed, the Second Amendment is dead.
And don't dismiss this as partisan outrage, even the NRA said plainly that this justification
is dangerous and wrong.
Think about how far we fall in with the NRA, understands the Constitution better than
this administration.
That is not public safety, that is instability.
This is a government testing how far it can go before we push back.
Because once the government proves it can label you a terrorist and kill you for exercising
your rights, people retreat, communities fracture, violence escalates, and the country becomes
less safe for everyone.
And in the middle of this crisis, this body demanded that the Secretary of State break the
law, not for the Constitution, not for public safety, but because Donald Trump demanded it.
So I'll ask this question plainly, what rights are left that you're not willing to sacrifice
for him?
Real talk.
For 10 years, the majority has bent the needs of Trump again and again, and now you're
willing to throw the Second Amendment on fire.
The same amendment, you've spent decades pretending to defend.
If y'all abandoned that, y'all would abandon anything.
And if the price of obedience to Trump is a destruction of our rights, then the answer
is no.
Let's pass SR605 on the consent calendar tomorrow.
And let's show that Georgia will not be complicit in this assault on the Constitution.
Thank you.
And I yield the will.
All right.
We have before you a consent calendar of privilege resolutions.
Does any senator wish to remove a resolution from the consent calendar?
Is there objection to the adoption of the resolutions on the consent calendar?
The chair here is none and the resolutions on the consent calendar are adopted.
Are they?
Are there any motions to withdraw and commit?
Chair recognizes the Senator from the 9th.
Thank you, Mr. President.
May I ask for unanimous consent for SB 166, be withdrawn from the committee on state and local government operations general and be committed to the committee on urban affairs.
The center from the night has asked for unanimous consent that SB 166 be withdrawn from the committee on state and local government operations general and be committed to the committee on urban affairs.
I'll rate the caption.
Secretary, sorry, that we're in the Senate, not the House.
Set a bill 1-6-6, a bill to be entitled an act to amend Chapter 1 of Title 36 of the official code of Georgia annotated relating to general provisions applicable to counties only.
So as the revised provisions relating to ordinances for governing and policing unincorporated areas of counties to amend Chapter 60 of Title 36 of the official code of Georgia annotated relating to provisions applicable to counties of municipal corporations.
So as to authorize enhanced monetary penalties for repeated violations of certain county immunisable codes or ordinances to provide for a definition, to provide limitations on such penalties, to provide for related matters, to repeal conflicting laws and for other purposes.
Thank you, please see her.
All right. The senators are from the 9th has asked that Senate Bill 166 be withdrawn from
the Committee of State and local government. Operation General be committed to the Committee
on Urban Affairs. Senator have the chairman of both committees agreed to this. Do I see
the chairman nodding? Is there objection? Hearing none, Senate Bill 166 is referred to
committee on urban affairs. Does the senator wish to speak?
All right.
The chair has now the board of the committee is agreed to.
Hang on a second, guys.
I have before you a consent counter of local bills, Mr. Secretary of any objections been
