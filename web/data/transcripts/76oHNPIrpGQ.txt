TRANSCRIPT
----------
All right, so Leonard and Joanne, they are great individuals
in Blakely, Georgia.
He is the oldest five children.
He's a veteran.
He was in the United States Air Force,
where he went on to Olimberley's serve,
his country for 20 years.
And we find that when he got out of the Air Force,
he came home.
He came home to Georgia, and that's so important.
He didn't think about Florida anymore,
Georgia became his home.
Darrell has a master's degree in theology
from North Carolina College of Theology,
and he's the pastor of New Zion Baptist Church
and Seahoke Ministries there and Blakely.
I've had the opportunity to visit with him
and with Jason there and talk about some of the things
that are important and what's going on in Blakely, Georgia.
And I know that we have another lady
that is very important to Blakely Georgia
and early county.
And I hope she will make sure that she speaks
to Darryl and just a little bit.
But I wouldn't tell you just quickly,
when early county was hit by Hurricane Michael,
Darryl coordinated and oversold the utilization
of visiting and local Southern Baptist disaster relief
teams. They fed over 1,000 meals a day for three weeks and took care of individuals in the area.
And I have the great pleasure to this morning to introduce the Reverend Darryl Alexander,
but more than that I introduce my friend to you this morning. Thank you.
Good morning, I'm just so thrilled to be here this morning with you all.
Thank you so much, so much my friend representative Greene for the invite, and I thank you so
much represented Speaker Ralston for allowing me to come and share my convictions with
you all this morning.
And I thank you so much.
Everyone is here in the house.
I truly do.
I thank you.
Thank you for my friends and my family that traveled in support of me.
So I thank you.
I thank you.
I thank you.
You're staff.
You're staff so graciously sent me all the documents and everything that I needed
for today. They gave me what to expect and what not to expect. But Alicia told me that
there was an error on one of the documents that they sent to me. It says that I was supposed
to speak for five minutes. She said it was 20. Just joking.
When I met for the first time Representative Green, I was still in the Air Force, so
over 15 years ago, and I was visiting my parents who had just moved to the area, hadn't
been there long at all.
And as I'm walking in the front door, I see this guy, it looked like somebody or something
was chasing him.
He had his tail, his shirt tail out.
He was drenching, drenching wet.
So he came, fell on the porch.
And I said, come in, come in, quick.
My dad come running out.
He's like, what is going on?
And this man says, can I have some water of the first day
he wanted, it was water.
He got down the water.
He says, how you doing?
I'm representative Gerald Green, now I want you to vote.
Every since then, we've been friends.
He was so down the earth and I just really, really appreciate him.
So let me get on with the task at hand that I have for today.
What I want to impress upon you today, it comes out of Isaiah, Isaiah the 43rd chapter.
Isn't it Old Testament?
And if you don't know, you can find some fresh stuff in an old well.
Isaiah the 43rd chapter, I'm going to be reading verses 18 through 19 and I'll use the King
James version.
it reads, remember ye not, the former things, neither consider the things of old. Behold,
I will do a new thing. Now it shall spring forth. Shall ye not know it. I will even make
a way in the wilderness and the rivers and the desert. Here we have the children of Israel
was expecting God to show up like he's shown up before and God was reminding the children
of Israel to remember not how I did it before. Remember not how it was done before. We are
are so quickly to look at the blessings of before.
We're so quickly to look at how God had done it before.
We look at how he did it with Samson, and we expect that same thing.
We look at how he did it with David, and we do expect that same thing.
When he shows up with manner, we look for him to do it the same way.
When he showed up and parted the red sea, we look for him to do it the same way.
But the Scripture tells us to remember not those former things.
wants us to not allow that old baggage that we carry around. Old baggage for us may be
the hurt, the pain, the sorrows that we've had, the scars. He says, remember not. Perhaps
legally speaking, you may be hurt partly by the word that declares, forget the former
things so that you will probably position to embrace what God is ready to do for you.
Paul tells us in Philippians 3 and 13 that his approach was to forget those things that
are behind him.
My brothers and sisters, anything that would keep you glued to the past, God is telling
you this morning to just cut it off.
And I know the business that you all are in, a lot of times we look at how things have
been done in the past, how things have played out in the past.
God is saying he wants to do something new, don't even consider those things of old.
Anything God does, he wants to consider not to consider those old things.
does however ask you to focus on the new. He's doing a new thing. God is not going to recycle
or resurrect anything old. He's going to do a new thing, new meaning not old, not seen
before. That's what he wants to do. No eyes have seen, no ears have heard what God is
getting ready to do. A couple of weeks ago I started my diet a little
overweight and that dieting is something new for me. So I get up one
morning and I boil me some eggs. I started the keto diet, high protein, low
carbohydrates. So I got up this morning, I speak
and I began to bore my eggs and I bore my eggs and when I got finished
boiling my eggs, what do we have? There's two things we got to have with the
boiled eggs. Salt and pepper. So I began to look for my salt and pepper and I go
into cabinet and I can't find the salt. And I'm looking and I cannot find the salt
know where then I said well it's got to be in here so I begin to look for the
pepper and I can't find the pepper anywhere now at this point if you like me you
want to find the things you salt and pepper ought to be there if you like me
and you're going to aggravate it where is the salt and the pepper so by this time
I pull out everything in the cabinet and I can't not find the salt and the pepper.
And now I am aggravated and my wife is in the back and I'm wondering thinking to myself,
what kind of a house is this with no salt and pepper?
So I'm trying to contain myself before I go back and I ask my wife, where is the salt
and the pepper?
So I'm marching back and steadily I'm trying to contain myself about the salt and pepper
and I get back to my wife and she's back there, she's doing her makeup and doing a facial
and getting ready.
I said, honey, she says yes.
I said, we don't have any salt and pepper, she says yes we do.
I said, no, we do not.
She says, honey, we have salt and pepper.
I said, no we don't.
I went and looked in the, in the China cabinet,
where I looked in the little crystal salt shakers,
and there's nothing in it.
We don't have any salt and pepper,
and she just mosey on up to the kitchen,
where I had taken out every seasoning out of the cabinet.
She had went up in that same cabinet,
reached up and pulled out salt and pepper,
and I'm looking at what is she pulling down,
and I look and I see sea salt, I wasn't looking for sea salt, I was looking for the canister
with the blue boat on it.
She pulls out the pepper, it was the ground pepper, and I'm the wait-a-man, I'm looking
for the little can of pepper, what I'm trying to tell you this morning is we'll miss
What God is doing in our life by holding on to the old things, the old ways, the old looks,
we will miss it.
When God says that He wants to do that new thing, stop looking for that old thing.
God wants to open up a released new solutions to the problems that you may have been troubling
you.
connections will spring forth. New doors are open. New relationships will be
established. New fellowships. New ministries. New churches. New way of doing
business. God wants to do this new thing in your life. And when he says, I do, I do.
Says God says, behold, I do. The alpha and omega, the beginning and the end to all
things. He says, I do. He's the one that's going to do it, not you, and it's power in his name.
He says it's going to spring forth. The Bible declares that the new thing will spring forth.
That means that everything that you touch, if you embrace what he's trying to do, it will bloom.
It will blossom. It will spring forth. And that's what he's letting us know on today. The time is
now. This battle is not for the strongest. Your time is now. Your testimony is
springing forth. And since it's the giver of life, we expect Jesus this and
Jesus mighty name. When he says, I'll make a way in the wilderness and rivers in
the desert. You'll begin to get the victory where normal circumstances and
situations is impossible. Nobody be able to explain it because it will be beyond human
reasoning. A way will be made for you when it seems to be no way. God would begin to
reveal Himself as the waymaker, the solution giver, the way, the wisdom, the understanding.
All we have to do is begin to grab a hold of what God is telling us this day, this time,
this season.
I stopped trying to hold on to the new thing that God is doing.
I know when I was a kid, I love to come up and develop my own presentations.
I knew it that I kind of wanted to be a preacher or speaker or something.
When I would develop slide shows, y'all, some of y'all know y'all remember the old slides
you put up and you got the microfiche, someone had microfiche and yet the slides.
We progressed from the slides and we went into, as I got older, PowerPoint became very
revelant, prevalent. My son, he wasn't just in the ninth grade, he took my PowerPoint
presentation that I'm preparing for my work and he added some animation and he had helicopters
flying in, things of that nature. And now my granddaughter, she was over the other day
and she had my phone and she casted my presentation on the TV. I learned how to cast
still. What I'm trying to tell you is we got to let go of some of our old ways, our old
ideas, our old and embrace the newness what God is bringing forth with us on today. Let
it go and let God do what He is calling each and every one of us to do. Can we stand
in prayer. Father, we thank you for your word. Father, we thank you for your word is
fresh. And it reminds us of Father God. Sometimes we are guilty of holding on to our old
mindsets, our old way of thinking, our old way of doing business. But today, Father,
You let us know, Father God, that it's time to move forward and to the newness and to
the thing that you're bringing in for us.
So Father, we pray now that we'll be able to see and recognize what you're doing for
us in our life.
We'll be able to see what you are doing.
So now, sensitize our ears so we'll hear you.
We'll hear you, Father God.
Hear the voice coming from you.
We know, Father God, that this is how you lead us and guide us to all truths.
We pray these things in Jesus' magnificent name, the ever heart say, man, amen, amen.
Would y'all stand with me as we honor the pledge of allegiance.
to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands,
one nation under God, individual, with liberty and justice for all.
Doorkeepers will unlock the doors.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Last year we lost some very special people in Georgia.
We lost sons and daughters, brothers and sisters.
We lost parents and loved ones.
Last year we lost almost 1,500 Georgians to suicide.
It's the 10th leading cause of death in Georgia.
And if you look at the one page that I provided on your desk this morning, you'll see it's
actually the second leading cause of death in Georgia for our young adults.
But we have great people in this state who are working to turn that around and change
that.
One of those groups is the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention who is here with
us today.
Some of them are in the gallery and I'd ask them to stand and be recognized.
We thank them each year they do the hard work to raise money to change this and turn around
these death rates, last year they raised nearly half a million dollars and were the largest
chapter in America.
We thank them for their great work and the work that they are just to do.
Thank you.

A moment in black history, black women in the movement,
In April, 1960, Civil Rights Aleda, Ella Baker urged student
activists at Shell University in North Carolina
to form an organization based in participatory democracy
and grassroots advocacy.
The students created the National Violet Coordinated
Committee in 1961.
SNCC Freedom Riders, Challenge Segregated Interstate Bus
Travel, Ella Baker's Activism and Mentorship
transformed their landscape of the Civil Rights
struggling and exemplify black women's key role in the movement.
For years before Rosa Park famous arrests launched the Montgomery bus boycott,
black women board the daily humiliation of segregation, sexual harassment,
and violence from the bus driver, say police.
Though leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King,
Jr. became the face of the protest scholars, recognized that the boys got
both counts, success relied upon the black women who initiated and
maintain it.
Black women like Constance Baker-Martler, Diane Nash,
Amelia Boyton, Robert Samarion Wright,
Elderman, Elaine Jones, David Bates,
the team of Clark, Fannie Lou Hamer,
and Charlotte Chisholm,
with indispensable active civil rights lawyers
and political leaders whose efforts advance
the fight for injustice and equality.
Before her death in 1986, Ella Baker distributed her strength
to her grandmother who suffered brutal violence
a resistant insolatement, like Harriet time
of sojourner truth and out of the wells
and so many other ancestors, the black women
of the civil rights were criticized and shaping
the resistance to racism and sexism in America.
Today's moment in black history.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes representative Cannon
for a morning order.
Good morning, colleagues. For this moment in black history, we're discussing the Alvin
Ailey American Dance Theater. For over seven decades, they have been visiting Atlanta
and Georgia, helping to promote the uniqueness of the African American cultural experience,
And they have been bringing modern dance heritage to more than 25 million people.
We ask that you understand the importance of the work they're doing and teaching our
children empathy through dance and cultural expression.
If you are in Atlanta, please also go and check them out this moment in black history today.
Thank you.
Chair recognizes representative Hutchinson for a morning order.
Good morning colleagues.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Today I'd like to introduce you to 13-year-old Larry.
Larry wants to visit Disney World and learn to play basketball and football sometime in the near future.
Larry is a fun, neat, loving, caring, and helpful child.
He loves watching video games, playing football, and making everyone laugh.
Larry is one of the hundreds of children that are available for adoption today in Georgia.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes representative Clark
and representative Moore for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
It's very evident there's a lot of age
a lot of wisdom in this chamber, but we're here to create something new. It's called
the Georgia Future Caucus and it's a bipartisan effort to look at issues that affect a younger
generation and how we can benefit future Georgians.
So my colleague and I, Colton and I, will serve as co-chairs of this caucus and we invite
any one to join the caucus, but we are specifically looking for legislators under the age of 45
and we'll be focusing on issues affecting Georgians in that age group. This is a bipartisan
caucus and we are pleased to be joining more than 900 state legislators in 29 states as a part
of the National State Future Caucus Network.
There's more information on the flyers on your desk.
Again, anyone is invited to join,
but we are specifically looking for our younger legislators,
and that is the group that we will be focusing on issues for.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you, colleagues.
Chairman Hogan wants to be your speaker at your first meeting.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I am joined by a deal of friend and a Georgian that has put in 40 years in the technical
school system here and at Augusta Tech and Augusta Georgia. But I think we

welcome him and his family here to the to the Capitol.
40 years of service to this state.
We have Missouterra Elam, his wife Patricia, his son and daughter-in-law, I'm sorry,
daughter. I'll marry the son and the daughter there. That's not the way it goes. But we are
so happy to have them. And this family means a lot to the Augusta and to the area and
to the state. And I wanted to invite him and his family here to just have a quick word
of his, you know, I'll leave it up to Terry. Terry is known for being the one that if
you ever sit in the board meeting with him or any kind of meeting, he'll sit back and
just wait. Everybody expresses their opinion and Terry will come in at the last minute
and make a statement, and his statement will literally change the minds of everybody from
one place to another, and colleagues, I want you to welcome Mr. Terry Elam.
Thank you, and formally this is my wife of 50 years, Patricia, my daughter, Joy, and
my son, Brandon, to the speaker. Thank you. I'm running the state from a
legislative standpoint. You get 40 days to set the agenda for a year. And then
it's people like me who work for the state. I work 47 years. 23 is a college
president and I can tell you three things kept me in the right mind. First of all
it's integrity. Second is looking for truth and last always looking for
knowledge because you didn't wake up every day as smart as you go to sleep that
that afternoon. Hopefully you learned something every day and as a lifelong learner my time
represent thousands of students, thousands of employees, and working for economic development
in the CSRA. We even helped South Carolina a little bit every now and then. So I can tell you
It was tough getting up at 4.30 this morning driving up here when 8 o'clock is now my

We are going on now to the rules calendar.
Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 780.
House Bill 780 by Representative Perkwood, 155th Green and 151st and others to be entitled
and lack to amend Code Section 50, 1634,
the fiscal to Georgia and tentative relating the powers
and duties of the State Properties Commission.
Mr. Levin referred to the committee
on State Properties,
that committee recommends this bill do pass.
Chair recognizes Representative Perkel
to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, colleagues.
HB780, I have for your consideration.
We often want to just pass bills that provide more efficiency in our government and able
to save money.
This is one of the bills.
It's very small, seven word change, and let me just give you some background.
Presently, if you have a new technical school in your district, we have to grant, if Georgia
powers providing the power to it, we have to grant them an easement in order to lay
the overhead line or dig a trench to provide power to us.
The way our Georgia code presently exists,
if we grant an easement to a private entity,
we must get an appraisal on the value of that.
When we annually, we have the easement,
annual easement conveyance bills from state properties,
and there are between 10 and 20 per year.
All of the valuations come back in that $10 range,
the value of the easement.
And we are spending $3,000 to get a $10 evaluation.
This bill will allow us to bypass that
and allow the state properties to value that.
And that's what the bill does, Mr. Speaker.
If there's any questions, I'll do my best.
You have no questions?
Thank you, sir.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
The chair here is none the previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable
to the passage of the bill?
The chair here is none the report of the committee is agreed to.
Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of House Bill 780, will vote
Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines have all members voted
have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill
780. The eyes are 149. The nays are zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority
is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 487.
House Bill 487, my friends, in a bonnet of the 72nd and others to be entitled back to
Monarchal 6th, Chapter 3, Title 38, the official go to Georgia Antony, relating the disaster
volunteer relief act.
Let's bill that referred to the Committee on Public Safety and Homeland Security.
That committee recommends that this bill do pass by Committee Substitute.
Chair recognizes Representative Bonner to present the bill.
Thank you Mr. Speaker, colleagues, I rise this morning to present House Bill 487.
This amends the disaster voluntary relief act for Georgia.
It extends the same courtesy that we currently provide to state employees that are members
of the Red Cross, to state employees that are members of the Civil Air Patrol.
This would provide a state employee that is also a member of the Civil Air Patrol up to
15 days paid leave in a 12-month period in order to respond to a disaster here in Georgia.
This can only be done upon the name, a name disaster by the governor and at the request
of the Civil Air Patrol and an agreement with that employee's department.
The other thing this bill does is to rename that act to the Robert Argo disaster volunteer
relief act as a way to honor one of our former colleagues who was very active in the Civil
Air Patrol during World War II.
Civil Air Patrol provides important functions here in the state of Georgia.
The Georgia Wing of the Civil Air Patrol is actually one of the largest in the country.
They respond during Hurricane Michael with over 152 flight hours.
They perform missions such as search and rescue, aerial reconnaissance, and aerial photography.
They are volunteers and so they are providing a vital service to the state of Georgia.
So with that, Mr. Speaker, I'll stand for any questions.
You do have a question if you care to yield.
I'll yield.
Chair recognizes representative Rodgers to your right for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Mr. Chairman, would the gentleman yield?
I will.
Is it not true that this bill has passed a couple of different times in the house and just gotten called up and crossed the way?
That's correct, the bill previously came out of the house but did not make it through
the Senate.
And is it not also true that the bill after being named for former representative Argo
who was a gold congressional metal winner for his service to the civil air patrol in World
War II?
That is correct.
Great.
Thank you, sir.
It's a great bill.
Thank you.
No further questions.
Thank you.
I yield the well.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
The chair here is none.
