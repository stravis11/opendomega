TRANSCRIPT
----------
We'll go ahead and call our meeting to order. I do not have a quorum yet, but I had Sarah Nichols, you all heard us testify about SJ Labs in making over and over the last couple of days. I want to give her an opportunity to be heard since she wasn't able to be here at the previous meetings. So this is kind of a wrap up on the hemp bill, but it may also kick in on the marijuana as well if we get to the testing stages of that. So Ms. Nichols, if you're here, we'll let you share your thoughts with the committee. Sort of just introduce yourself, tell us about your company, get right there on that podium. Good morning. My name is Sarah Nichols. I'm the owner of SJ Labs in Analytics. We're an independent cannabis testing facility in Macon, Georgia. We're the first and only in the state right now. We work with the industry for compliance testing with the Georgia Department of Agriculture. We also work with farmers, processors, and dispensaries for testing the items that are getting to consumers. I'm in a unique position because I get to see what is coming through for the industry. I don't know how many of you peruse the CBD stores to actually see some of the inventory, but I did bring a show and tell. Is there somewhere I can show it to folks? I'm going to start out by saying that cannabis is cannabis and that doesn't change whether we're talking about the hemp variety or whether they're talking about a marijuana variety. In the Georgia medical legislation, testing is required. It's required because it's critical to the safety of these products getting to the consumer. Whether that's a CBD product, a Delta 8 product, or a medical Delta 9 product, those safety concerns still exist. It's the same crop and the same processing mechanism. I also want to point out that the hemp bill focuses on .3% THC and what that has created as a loophole. We don't have anything written on what the maximum dosage is. The heavier I make a product, the more THC I can put into it. I want to give you an example of a Rice Krispy treat. This is a real-world example. If you go into your stores and you buy a Rice Krispy treat that they're selling, which they are, they're going to weigh anywhere from 50 to 70 grams. .3% THC means that it's 3 milligrams per gram. If we do that math, that Rice Krispy treat can hold up to 150 milligrams. What does 150 milligrams of Delta 9 THC mean? 150 milligrams of Delta 9 THC per serving is 15 times the recreational limit. I really want to put that into perspective. We haven't cleaned up our bill enough that the product's getting to consumers makes sense. We have giant loopholes. I'm going to show you guys some real-world products that we've tested. These are all testing on label, but I want to point out that 60% of products that are being sold in these shops are not testing on label. They are not tested for safety compliance tests. They get sold out to the consumers. They get there because other states with tighter regulations have companies who are producing product that's failing their state regulations and they're getting sold here. Our folks can't sell safe products and we're coming under fraudulent COAs that are getting to consumers. I'm going to show you all some things. Can everyone hear me? This is a Delta 9 THC product. It's a dummy product. This is a equivalent to a recreational product that you would find in Colorado or California. It's 10 servings of 10 milligrams. This is what the max is that we see in recreational industry. This is sold perfectly legally in the state of Georgia. Remember, 3 milligrams per gram. All I need to get to 10 milligrams is 3.3 grams. That's the size of the gummy. This is a cough syrup. None of these, by the way, have full panels. None of these were even tested before the client purchased them. They purchased them through a vendor. They sent it to me for a potency test because they got busted by the police. They have no safety panels on it. This is a cough syrup of 20 milligrams per serving. You are talking to some people that don't have a vote. There's about a million people online that can't hear a word you're saying because you're not on the mic and the committee members that might take this into account and do their vote can't hear you either. If you want us to hear you and the citizens of Georgia, you need to talk from that microphone or if you're more comfortable coming up here, that would be fine. This is a cough syrup. This 20 milligrams per serving is what they claim the serving sizes. That's two times the recreational dose. It's a total of 420 milligrams of delta 9 THC in this product. That's 4.2 times the recreational maximum. This is 750 milligrams of delta 8 THC. This is 700 milligrams of delta 8 THC. This one is delta 9 and CBD. It's 20 milligrams. Again, two times the recreational limit. This is 800 milligrams of delta 9 THC. These products are not safe for consumption because your average consumer doesn't recognize what it means. I have these mango cubes. They probably taste fantastic. I'm going to eat the whole jar of them. Your average consumer may not understand what 800 milligrams ingesting 800 milligrams of THC does and it obliterates you. Now, you're not really a threat to anybody. You're going to go to sleep, but it will obliterate you. It's really important that we put limits, not on a percent, but on a dose and on a max per package, which this bill does. I also want to point out that, again, none of these have safety panels tested on them. I also brought vapes. These vapes are sold in Georgia. I have a delta 8 V8 950 milligrams. I have a THC M THC P THC H delta 8 V8. Neither one of these tested legal. In fact, in almost a thousand vapes I've tested that are delta 8 vapes. The lab report that's accompanying them are false and they are not legal. I've tested two or three that past. We also don't have standards for THC M or THC H. These are being sold to consumers because we don't have testing regulations. I really want to reiterate that I know there's been some, I have heard some discussions about well, we talk about 0.3 percent. What's the point in putting in a dose for delta 8 or why is that important? What I want to share with you is regardless of how you feel about 25 milligrams or 500 milligrams, it's still substantially better than what the market is getting today. We need oversight. We need regulation in this industry, not only for the safety of the consumer, but for the protection of the farmers and the processors who are attempting the seller product in Georgia who are being out competed by product that's not even labeled correctly. And that's really all I came to say. We're all the products that you're showing us there being sold in Georgia today. Yes sir. In fact, I received these from a CBD shop here in Georgia. And where they manufactured do you know that? I'm not sure where each individual product is manufactured all over the country. A lot of the misconception is for a CBD shop. I have a vendor out in California and it must be so much better because it's coming out of California. But California has really tight regulations. To sell a product in California, you have to be taught notch. You have to have all your products tested. They have to pass a wide array of safety tests. The label has to be within 10 percent of what you're labeling it. And if they fail the test, guess where they're getting sold. Here. And it's created a loophole of poor products. There are definitely people out there who are trying to do things the right way. But there aren't Georgia people competing in the market right now. It is all out of state people. And they are taking advantage of our lack of regulation. Why aren't the Georgia people competing? We're not regulating them anymore either. I mean, as far as this testing and labeling. We don't have many processors. In fact, I think last year we had one operational processor. He's sitting here in the crowd with us. And I can attest that Will Wingate is very conscientious of the products that he's producing. He tests them rigorously. He has his own internal standard. We talk a lot about how in order for this industry to function, those of us who are serving the industry in Georgia have to operate better than what the legislation has provided. Unfortunately, you still have a reputation to compete with of, well, it's California. It's Colorado. This guy's been my friend for five, seven years. He would never do me wrong. But the reality is the problem can go back to the vendors changing the COAs and selling you product that's not accurately represented. They haven't been retested per batch. They're completely lying about what it is. It's a whole array of issues where they're not stable to begin with. But Georgia isn't able to compete because other states are scurrying their regulations to sell cheaply into ours. Senator Brass, you got any milligram or packaging questions? You had mentioned the one vape thing had it was 950 milligrams. What was the other one? So this one list itself as 950 milligrams. This is the one that you were referring to. And did that, was that one cartridge? It is actually a pre-done thing. You just take it and hit it. And this failed by the way. So the lab report that accompanied this said that it was under 0.3% THC and it actually tested at 3% THC just for reference. And again, my Delta 8 carts don't pass. Will you be testing medical marijuana products as well? Yes, sir. That's the intention. I'm still now they're not produced so you hadn't had a chance to test them in Georgia. Yes, sir, that's correct. We are waiting for the application to be released by the commission and is our intention to complete that application and fulfill the testing need for Georgia. Senator Brass, I'm sorry to go ahead. Well, I'm powered as for being right, Mr. Chairman. But who are you with? I own SJ labs and analytics where a third party independent cannabis testing facility and make in Georgia. Okay. And then for the hemp bill, you're, so you in favor of doing something? Absolutely. So, you're in the regulation and we need oversight and we need it expeditiously. Okay. Thank you. Senator Somers, I'm an minority leader. Go right ahead. If you have a question. I was going to ask that question if she was in favor against the bill. And some of the products that you held up, I didn't know what they were. Is this on Mr. Chairman? Your own number 10. Is there on the product how much should be consumed and how often you're in the consume and how often it should be consumed? I'll just pick the just use it as they feel like it. Excuse me, I'm sorry. There are no required labeling as far as what the serving size should be, how much you should take at a time. And again, if we go back to the Rice Krispie treat, there's nothing on that label that says do not eat the whole thing at once. Versus in regulated recreational industries, it is. It has to actually be physically divided up into so many servings that it's representing. So there are no labeling regulations and it varies what people put on them. But again, even what they put on the label, 60% of products that are being sold don't match what it is that they're putting on the label. Well, I realize there's no labeling but I've thought at least common sense might prevail and recommend a dosage. It's difficult to have common sense for something that you haven't done before. So it's hard to say why I've never consumed this product and I suddenly understand what 10 milligrams versus 100 milligrams means. You know, when we take Tylenol or ibuprofen, it specifically says how much to take in a time period because unless you're producing it or studying the biochemistry and how the body is adapting to it, you don't really understand how it's affecting you until you use it. Thank you. Senator Summers, you have a question. You'll wait. All right. Don't rush back to making it. We might talk to you later today. Yes, Senator Doe's. All you recognize. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for being here. I think one of the things is maybe confusing to some of us on this committee is what exactly is captured in this bill and what is not. So of the items that you had in your bag that you showed us, how many of them would need to change either dosage labeling, testing, anything based on this bill? Every single one of them with the exception of this product, which would still pass is 0.3%, is under 25 milligrams per serving, is total serving size is 100 milligrams, so it passes. It does not have a full panel test, which none of these products do. But otherwise, every product in this bag is either failing the 0.3% threshold over the serving size, over the max dosage, and none of them have panel test. So regardless of the isomer that is used, and again, we're trying to learn all this quickly, you're an expert. Regardless of the isomer that is used, because are all what isomer is used in those products, it varies the finest of the correctly, is that right? Yes, that's correct. So we have some here that have esters, some that have isemers, and then some that are like your CBD, which we call a neutral. Yes, there are different classes of cannabinoids, and these, this is a variety, but some of them are labeled as products that I can't even, I can't even confidently test for in a way that's certifiable. I can see it, but I can't certify it because I don't have a standard to do that with, and it's being sold and we have new ones come in every week. I have no idea what they are. I can't even test for it. We definitely don't know how the body is reacting to it. Okay, thank you. So what's the danger? What's to the end user to the customer? They ingest these products? So there's a cover, or what? All of these products will give you an effect, a high effect, so to speak, every product that I have in the bag. That's not really the biggest danger. The danger from these products, the vape carts, for example, I don't know how THCM reacts with the body. There's not any research on it. I don't know whether it has heavy metals present, which is pretty common for vape carts because they're not getting a test. I don't know whether they have pesticides present or not because they're not getting a test, and then people are inhaling them. One of the biggest threats, particularly from plant material, is going to be your aspergillus and your mycotoxins. Most plant material will fail a pesticide test. When that goes through processing, that becomes more concentrated, and it either needs to be remediated. And if it's not, it's getting sold directly to the consumer and then inhaled or created into product. So THC is not the biggest threat here. Your esters and your stress and aesthetics that people are producing are certainly a concern of mine because, again, there's not enough data or research. I know how THC reacts in the body. I know what somebody's going to do on it. I don't know how this stuff does. And the education to the consumer and the transparency and the safety panel test. Those are the biggest threats that this bill addresses. All right. Thank you. That's all the questions. Appreciate you being with us. Representative Perkley, do you have just a minute you wanted to wrap up? I told you yesterday I let you conclude then I got chairman Powell ready to go on mayor one. I'm so sorry. Can I leave these with you guys? Yeah, please drop them off up here. Let's get the drugs. That's my intern. Brass can't have them. I'm not going to go ahead. Senator again did have a quick call. I do have a man. I do have a quick question for you. If you would said because you just told us that those were above the legal limit and they would make you hot. Are those illegal to possess? So I want to be clear most of those are not above legal limit. They're perfectly legal in our sold and sold together. Two vape carts are. And actually I think only one vape cart is I'm not sure about the other I don't quite remember. Yes, there's one vape cart that is legal and in fact delta eight vape carts that I test only two of the roughly thousand that me and my partner lab have tested have passed. Good move. Let's chairman to have it. I'll pick that by your end. He'll do a little private investigation. Representative Perkley. I think Mr. Chairman I will be quick. We've talked before about I am the most unlikely of people that would would bring this bill. But for me it is consumer protection. I really want firm guard rails on this. I'm not saying that what we have is perfect. I'm saying it's better than what we have now. So in 2015 the Kansas City Royals won the World Series. They did it in a five game series and they beat the New York Mets with two home runs. Not in one game, not one better, but the entire series they had two home runs. New York Mets. They had one player had more than that. But the Kansas City Royals won by getting a guy on base moving across, hit to the other side and score the runner. They played small ball. They advanced the runner. What I'm here today, what I my intentions for this bill is not hitting the home run. I want to advance the runner and I feel like we can do that with this bill. So thank you Mr. Chair. Thank you. All right. Now they've made an attraction. House bill 196. Chairman Powell, if you would please present to us your legislation. It's in all the folders up here. Floors yours Mr. Chairman. Thank you Mr. Chairman in the distinguished chairman in my counterpart in the Senate and the illustrious members. I'm bringing to you today House bill 196. Now I'm not sure that you'll may have a committee sub. But you're not having committee sub. Then I'm shocked. But we may we have a meeting again tomorrow. We want you to thank you so so much. I've also given a late another substitute to House to a Senate bill 97. For your purview not for you to act on, but for your knowledge to look at what's going on in quarters of the legislature. But with that, let me get into the meat of this issue. Ladies and gentlemen, most of you were here over the last seven years. Seven years ago, this legislature at the behest of children, veterans and those people who have found in the medical science has found that medical grade cannabis oil is of a benefit. At that time, I picked up the mantle personally because of a constituent up into co-ag Georgia, who had a grandchild that was born 12 years ago that suffered from seizures every 10 to 15 seconds. That child is 12 years old today. Still alive, but has no quality of life is what we know to be normal because of the seizures that that child is suffered at that time. The family was fortunate enough that the grandparents had to resources and the mother and the child relocated to Colorado for the accessibility of cannabis oil. That's just a background, ladies and gentlemen. The legislature had people in the galleries of both houses when that bill passed and everybody stood for applause. Four years ago, we started authorizing the grow in the distribution of cannabis oil. There was some technical errors or major errors quite frankly in the bill itself. We created a cannabis commission four years ago, ladies and gentlemen, that as of today, it there in broad and litigation. It took three years before they could finally ever issue licenses. And I'm telling you this because this is the gist of the bills and the issues that we're going with. The House Regulated Industries Committee had hearings last year to find out what was the hold up. At that time, we were told and I'm very cautious not to be insulting to the director, but it was his belief that he couldn't discuss anything that there was a cloud of secrecy around everything that did. So all the information that the members of House Regulated Industries could find or ascertain came from a lot of the protesters and it came from a lot of the folks who did not protest, but who had filed an application for a license. There was 69 of these to be exact. I believe that's the number. There was a series of questions that was put out by the cannabis commission to be answered. And they were did a judging based on a numerical system. Each of the members of the cannabis commission only dealt with one section. They didn't look at the product as a whole. And there was where the problem was. The method to the, and I'm not even going to say the madness, but the method to the absolute insult of government bureaucracy, ladies and gentlemen. That was four years ago, three years ago, and the initial bill authorized two class A, 100,000 square foot facilities and four class B. Now, bring us up to date from that point. The legislation that I have offered and have come to the members of the legislature is a direct fix. And when you say, why it's a direct fix, what happened in the process was when the license were issued. Those people who had filed and they exercised their right to protest. And I think there was 17 protesters. Some of those who have gone out of business, they cut in the forward to litigation. There was forced on them, but there were nine of the protesters that went through the process and filed litigation. That litigation today, arrest in the court of appeals has been ongoing for a year. Back in the, I think last summer or whatever time it was, there was a TROs that were issued by courts. And they issued them on the four class T's. Before they could issue them on the class ones, they had already been issued by the cannabis commission. So there creates another situation that we have created a monopoly of two companies, two companies, ladies and gentlemen, and inherit wrong on behalf of government at this point. Mr. Mayor. Do you know the status of that litigation now because the two class ones, the class A's are up and running. But the other four kind of illegal limbo. The status is vested in not being a non attorney. I can tell you because I've certainly talked to enough and listened to enough attorneys in the process of this session. As I understand it, the two that were given a license before a TRO kicked in, they're in the process of building out and prepping to start selling product. The four that were tentatively, and tentatively is the definition. They weren't granted a license, but they were tentatively granted a license. That's where the TRA, TRO was placed on those. Then you had 80 people that had applied for those. I think it was 69 or so that had initially applied. But for the nine that did carry it through the process, they've spent their money. They've gone because they felt so so wronged in the process. When I say wrong, I would be remiss if I didn't tell you about what the members of the regulated industries and the house found from questions that of all the answers and everything was put forth. You could have had the same answer given by any of the companies. One would get a five point rating, the other would get a one or a zero. There was no rhyme to reason, which was the rationale behind the litigation is what I suspect. But that makes no difference to me. What makes a difference to me, ladies and gentlemen, is this legislature stood on his heels and they applauded the people in the galleries that we were finally doing something to help people, to help those children, to help those veterans, and ones at the medical sciences have said, well, THC or medical cannabis or medical marijuana or whatever you wish to call it, it's good. And to me, anything that God lets grow natural is better than something that's made in a laboratory if it works. I come from North Georgia, I come from the country and we believe in that kind of stuff that we don't want stuff if there's got other side effects. If I could, I'll be going through the bill with the chairman with your permission. Before you get into that, I want the committee to know what we're considering. House Bill 196 passed the House by Rules Committee Substitute. That's not our Rules Committee. LC 480911S, that's the bill before the committee. Now, Chairman Powell just passed out a substitute to a Senate bill that is not before this committee, but is it the same that you've just attached to it? No, it's not the same. You've changed, you no longer want House Bill 196. No, sir. No, sir. I am not going to intercede in the will of this committee. That's for the members in the chairman. I have passed this out for the benefit of the committee that if they wish to read it. And negotiations with members of the leadership in the Senate. There has been a lot of discussion about abolishing the cannabis commission and to move that operations over to the Department of Agriculture. In quite frankly, that's something I wholly support. That is not in the bill that I had passed from the House. So that in the bill that just came out of committee yesterday in the House. That bill that's in front of you, the Substitute to 97 Senate Bill 97 passed out of the public safety. We had thanks to the graciousness of Senator Evan Natardi. He will allow us to use his bill as a writer to strike his language out of the bill to use that bill to move it forward. And it's a whole another deal than what we're considering. And I'll be glad it's a proper time to go through a maftrax playing selling. We're going to focus on House Bill 196 for now. Very good. If you'll look because of the issues that we've dealt with in Section 1, this puts the Medical Canvas Commission under the Administrative Procedures Act in the open records. Something that I have been very strong upon when we passed this bill four years ago, we didn't realize I don't know if anybody realized that whatever the court that they had total control not to divulge anything. But I would submit to each and every member here when there's a state agency or an authority or a board.

When they can answer questions to a standing committee of the legislature, there's a problem, ladies and gentlemen, and I would hope that you would certainly agree with me on that. If you get into Section T again, this puts some medical cannabis commission under the Department of Administrative Services Rules and Rags, D-O-S, Rules and Rags. On line 46 in Section T, this would move any appeals to the statewide business courts, so appeals would be handled by these statewide business courts, which would hopefully move it forward a little bit quicker. In Section 3, one of the problems we realized was that the number of six licenses that could be issued was that they were given the authority to have five dispensaries. Given the size of Georgia, even with six and 30 dispensaries, that means it would be difficult to have medical dispensaries in a close proximity to folks that they wouldn't have to drive great distances for these. So this allows those that are granted a license. Not only can they have five dispensaries, but they can also add one more dispensary on the property of where their operation is their growing process. Let me slow you down. I'm following long taking notes where we are, the deal about the statewide business courts. That would have been on line 47 and 48. Is that in any way interfere with the jurisdiction on the current litigation? No, sir. I do not believe it does. So let's say the Court of Appeals grants the relief asked by these nine unhappy licensees, and they're sent back to Superior Court. Is that where they will stay for the conclusion of that? It is my personal. I don't like them go to statewide business. I know this will go forward into the future of the business courts. The litigation litigation. The litigation it is held right now is under the current law, but I will also tell you that as we go through the bill, you'll see the reasoning behind what we've done later in the bill. Okay. The if the lawsuits are dropped, and the only way they could be dropped by these nine would be if they're granted a license. Then that issue goes away and then they can move forward. That's quite as simple as I could say, but let me go through the bill again. So you're taking notes on section three, line 61, 366. That would be the language that allows for a sixth dispensary, and that sixth dispensary would be on the property of the processor in the grower. If you go to line 106 in section three, once the original legislation passes, there's been a lot of advances in the cannabis medical cannabis operations. You had a young lady that spoke just a minute ago about hemp based things. Well, one of the things that I have learned is that each one of these grower operations will be creating a separate type of oil. If you look down through all of the illnesses that were in the original bill that was allowed for, there's only certain there's a different type of oil that affects a different type of disease or ailment. One of the things that I've realized as of the last year is there's a blending of hemp oil and THC oil that has a higher effect for a specific disease, because this is a medicine we're talking about. And rest assured, we're not talking about recreational cannabis. We're talking about medical grade cannabis, ladies and gentlemen, same thing that we did four years ago. So on line 106 and 7, this allows each of those licensed grower and operators that they can sell in their dispensaries, the products made by another one, basically the way a store would do it or a drug store would do. Okay, so I'm going to slow you down again to make sure my committee knows where we are with all this. I am advised by the current commission that they intend to issue these dispensary licenses in the month of April, and that they expect that the product from the two licensed holders that have not been challenged or not tied up in court may be able to have product out there by May June of this year. But under the current statute they can only have five dispensaries. This adds one and they can only sell the product that they make. So if you're just expanding one dispensary to each license center to enter sale there various products or whatever best suits a disease or condition. And we'll get to you. How about the pharmacies? Are they able to sell products from multiple licensees? Not cannabis, but they can sell other medical products, but not cannabis based. Well, I thought that original scheme was that these products, medical marijuana, low THC oil products could be sold through any pharmacies or through the dispensaries. Don't believe that's correct because I remember vaguely the debate at that time that most of the pharmacies since they hold both federal and state licensing, the federal licensing was problematic. That they were afraid that because under the federal rules this is still an illegal product. That's the reason you can't export it across state lines. The same reason that a lot of our perceived the same reason that a lot of our universities have failed to get into the growing of this product because they rely on a lot of federal grants and they didn't want to put that in jeopardy. I'm not going to continue interrupting you, but these first few sections of bill were pretty concise and non-controversial. So I'm going to allow Senator Brast has a question at this point. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Chairman, for bringing this bill. You keep mentioning that there are only allowed five dispensaries, but I just want to remind you, when we came back and did the dispensing law a couple years ago, we actually put in a trigger to where, and it's actually, if you look at lines 70, or really 73, 73, that's where we put in the trigger. So once the patient registry hits 25,000 patients, they may receive one extra dispensing license for every 10,000 patients thereafter. So we did put that in. So yes, under current law, they are only allowed five, but we did put that trigger in there. And one of the reasons I wanted to do it with the dispensing licenses is because one day I think that, and I've told this to use as well as others, but I think there should be some sort of trigger on the licensing as a whole. And I do want to add, since we're specifically talking about dispensaries, I do like your language on that allows them to do it on property. Because if you remember the way we crafted the law, they got, we basically were kicking them into rural counties. And so when we're talking about access, and as we all know, access in rural Georgia is very difficult. And so to allow these rural manufacturers to have a dispensary on site, we ensure that these rural counties are going to have access. And just as a point of reference, there are 26,000 patients on the registry at this time. Back to you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. If you'll go to section four, this just still assures it while open records. It does go into effect. And the APA, this also specifies that personal information and trade secrets are not open subject open records. I don't think Mary anyone else wants to know the trade secrets of a grower or whatever else. And we certainly don't want to know whatever personal information it might even get over into HIPAA on certain things. So this specifies those two areas that will not be open subject open records. So if you, sections five, six and seven, this is the, the, the, the just of trying to fix the problem. If you believe that to fix this problem sooner than one year, two years or ever how long this situation stays in the courts. And I know that that shutter, I shuttered when I say this to the, to the attorneys. Attorneys like litigation, they're paid by the word right Franklin by the hour, billable hour. But when I took on this task and in the house regulated industries, it was to fix a situation. I think it's that important to the people that are medically necessity this type of cannabis medicine. But to fix it in the straightforward way of fixing it in my opinion was to get it out of court. To take those protesters to give them a license. Now, I can't help that they may not have been the best choice or the last choice. But they did go through the process. They did file their paperwork. They did file an appeal. They did file a protest. And then they filed litigation because in their opinion, they were wronged. Only history will prove whether they were correct or not. But to fix this situation, the most fast and the most direct way of doing it was grant the other nine license. So if you're looking section five, six and seven, not to be misled because some of those protesters had applied for class one and two licenses. So what this does, this says that the commission not shall but may grant a license to those nine as well as to the four, not to exceed 15 licenses. If that made a better sense. And I will pause questions on that. The four new class one licenses. You have four that seven new class two. So four that were tentative have been tentatively approved for class two. Then you have nine of the protesting party. Some of them applied for a class one. Some of them applied for a class two. Now they can only get one. And that would be left up to the commission at their discretion to decide whether it's a class one or two. Into the day, they're going to be up to 15. There will be a maximum licenses. There will be a maximum of 15. And I would those there could be up to six class ones. And there could be up to 11 class two. That's that equal 17. So that's because you got some people can't have it both ways. That's exactly right. You can't have it both ways. And it sets a total of 15 licenses. Now let me recognize Senator Dolez all for a question. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman, Councillor, you just mentioned potentially oil being available in May and June. From which license is would those be available from or those both class one license is or the. Okay. Those are the only ones able to produce now. This was a conversation with Sid Johnson. The chairman gave me that information. So, Relent to that, Chairman Powell, what's the reason for expanding the class ones given as I understand it at least and correct from wrong, but there's no dispute currently. Or there's no limitation around the class ones. The dispute is over the nine protesters. Some of them applied. Some of them had applied for class one. Some of them applied for class T's. But they've not been able to encumber the class one production in any way. Is that correct? No. Okay. So given that, what's the thinking behind the class one expansion if the class ones will be coming in a matter of months? Well, the thinking is that you solve this issue. That if any of the nine protesters that are having brought in the litigation, whether they had applied for a one or a two, then they would be a plight. They would be granted that license and to move forward. I'm not sure the exact number since several of them applied for one's and two's, but they can only get one license. Okay. A couple of follow-up, Mr. Chairman. Go ahead of you. Could you walk us through, because I think this probably the meat of the bills. I may have been going to spend a couple minutes here. Could you walk us through essentially how many patients, as you're understanding that the class one facility can serve, how many patients are currently approved to be prescribed the oil and kind of what would happen? Are you proposing any additional limitations on the class one licenses, or would they still be 100,000 square feet and able to fully produce the bill? Class ones are defined and laws 100,000 square feet, class twos are described at 50. How many patients, is it you understand that a class one facility can serve? Honestly, I cannot tell you whether there's been testimony that was given. This bill has gone through a number of committees quite frankly. The past out of the house regulated it since last year. The current leadership, the new leadership of the house sent it to Non-Sovid Judiciary this year. And it was pretty well scraped and vetted over there. And then it just came out and now it's gone through public safety over in the house. So it's gone through a number of toss and turns. I guess my concern is, and I don't know the exact numbers, but my understanding is that the current class one licensees will be able to provide enough oil for something around four to five to, or even more than four to five times, the amount of people that we have. And so I wonder if expanding this exponentially beyond that potentially is going to limit their ability for all of these companies to stay in business anyway. As a free market person, I tend to believe that competition is good. If they don't stay in business and they'll go by the wayside. I think that each and every one of these growers, they have perfected different styles, different type of cannabis oils that would affect different type of illnesses. Over in the house we added two new illnesses and then yesterday there was a third that was added and don't ask me to pronounce them, but you'll see those in print. But I know that when people are suffering, they're suffering. Now, the alternative of not doing anything would be to allow the two monopolies to exist. And that's a dangerous situation. We saw in the House Judiciary Committee, we saw all of the attorneys that could be hired. And they were so eloquent, quite frankly. But the truth still came through. There was a lot of telling questions that was asked in that House Judiciary. They cross examined pretty well down there. And there was hours of hearings and questions that was asked. So the two that have a quote monopoly at this point, I think you have to ask yourself the question, is a monopoly good or not? Then most of us tend to believe it's not good. Because when it gives them the upper hand to raise the money, and quite honestly, I'm told that the fact that the longer this thing, the longer that they can maintain a monopoly, and they're quite happy to the idea of letting you go through lengthy court proceedings. Because this is worth mega millions of dollars for the two that have been granted a license. So when I'm hearing a little bit maybe, and this is an interesting argument, and thank you. I appreciate the free market approach or desire at least. It is likely not that this is actually if Chairman Cowsritz correct, and we're going to see oil in the hands of patients by call it June. This legislation does not actually speed this up, but it will offer options, you're saying, in terms of maybe the blend or the treatment opportunities or things like that, that would not otherwise be offered. I think you're correct, part of that, that they will be in operation by June, because I'm sure that any extra sunshine or whatever they can put on those plants, they're being put on to get them producing as fast as they possibly can, because of the situation. But that being said, we need to move forward if we're going to have a competitive market so that every qualified Georgian is on the registry has access, and they'll be available and the better product. Thank you. Senator Summers, you recognize. Thank you, Chairman Chempel. Two questions. The companies that got the license. Are they Georgia companies? You know, under the terms of what we passed four years ago, there's supposed to be Georgia based companies, and I'll be honest with you, what I have seen through what we have been able to determine without any assistance from the cannabis commission. No, we don't think they are. We think we've got one of the big ones, one of the class ones is out of Florida. There were certain questions asked in judiciary about one of them's husband who was charged with whatever down in Florida. I mean, you know, these were originally the intent of this legislature, where these were supposed to be Georgia based companies. Followed, Mr. Chairman. Yes. Chairman Chempel, could you touch on the commission just for a moment? I'm a little bit lost with the cannabis commission if you don't mind. What kind of money do we allocate for the cannabis commission? Who are they answered to? Well, best I can tell the answer to God Almighty. Or Georgia Spear Court judge since it's been, and there's not a lot of difference. Under this criteria that an A, a board of commission was created with no supervision under the administrative procedures act. They can't answer questions anyone. Now, I say that because apparently I hurt the feelings of their executive director, and I apologize that every possibility he's taking his position. He works for the cannabis board, and they tend to believe that they can't utter a word anybody, which also mean they can't even report to the governor's office, which might be one of the reasons that, well, I'm not going to get into the governor's office. That's their business. I know that they have an interest that this issue be corrected, but enough has said to that. But there's an answer directly. This current budget to be fixed in the past. There's a million and a half dollars that'll be budgeted to the commission. A little over around roughly a million and a half dollars for their operations to oversee. Whatever it is they're doing. Senator Brass, you recognize for a question. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I did want to kind of comment on the need for expansion isn't necessarily directly tied to the number of patients always. Because in some cases, I mean, I think the class two, the two class one licenses will more likely be able to supply enough oil for the number of patients for a long time. But it's not necessarily just about that. It's about what types of strands and what types of products are they offering. And they may not be offering everything to touch every diagnoses that we have. And so there could be a need for that. And I say that to say that, but right now we don't know. We don't know what we're going to need. We, you know, because we haven't even got started yet. But I really, my questions are going to be more, I think more legal and Chairman Powell, if you need to, if I need to direct this question later to another speaker, I'm more than happy to do that. But, you know, there's been talks about, you know, one of my concerns is, you know, if we're going to issue licenses to people that are suing over or appealing over a process that they feel is flawed. And then we're going to reward them over that same process. I feel like the next group of folks license applicants. I feel like now they have a case. And, you know, I'm just curious, are you familiar? Did you follow Florida at all? Because I know they went a similar route where I think they issued an initial five licenses. And then, and then 40 something. And, well, and so the first line of folks came in and appealed the sued. And then the legislature took action, gave them licenses. And then my understanding, and I didn't follow it closely. So that's what I'm asking you. Did you follow it? The next group came in and sued. And then more licenses were granted. I don't know if that was through the court process or through the legislature. But Chairman Cowsers now saying there's 40 something licenses. And so I'm just curious, you know, if we do this, you know, we've heard, we've heard in the hallways that the next group of folks that feel like they would be in line to get a license. Because they didn't sue, they don't have standing. I've heard that, but you follow what if you look at what happened in Florida, that's, that's not the case. And so I'm just curious is like Florida, they have different laws. As far as standing goes, or I mean, I'm just trying to understand the, I'm certainly no lawyer. So I don't, and I know you're not either. So I'm not trying to put you on the spot, but I'm just, that's kind of one of my concerns over what we're attempting to do here. Because I mean, you and I, we line up on this issue, except for maybe this, this one, one debate. Well, if I may, I'm not sure where to start because you had a number of questions. I want to center my question is centered around the court cases and the standing and who has standing. If we issue, let's say we do issue 15 total licenses, why would the, why would the next group of folks, why would they not have standing, why would they not want to sue? And why would we not come back next year and grant them licenses under the same principles that we're doing this? All right. With that, I might convey that I'm not a lawyer, which is my dear friend from Galwayta's not a lawyer. But I have listened to enough of these and I have looked through them and walked through this process. I can tell you nothing more than what I have been told by attorneys, legal counsel and judges. Everybody has a right to file suit if they have been wronged. And it becomes obvious that they were wrong in a flawed process for the issuance of a license. Now, I have no concern whether it's 9, 15 or otherwise. But I have a concern that we've created a monopoly of two and they're withholding product of medicine from the individuals that we as legislators have agreed that they have right to be treated with this type. Now, that tells me that the situation is at stands at their 9 protesters that filed a suit. They went through according to the lawyers, they tell me that these protesters, they file their appeals. The appeals was denied and then they filed litigation. None of the others did that. I know and talked to several of the companies that had had a tremendous amount of money into the process of trying to get a license. And it already built buildings in Clark County that they wound up selling. But thankfully for the real estate market, they made money off of that. But these folks actually did what they did. But whether or not they did or did not, the only ones that I'm told that have standing are the ones that filed an objection and then they were able to go forward with litigation. Now, mind is like I've said. I'm very grateful about it. They're sitting in the perfect situation. But I wasn't in favor of six anyway. Because back in the day when the study committee on cannabis was recommended, they recommended 12 licenses. And when they recommended 12, it went to conference committee. I think there's discussion about three. The 12 was a house version and it was settled at six. The committee didn't recommend a number. Our coach heard that. The study, we didn't recommend a number. We specifically didn't. One thing we did recommend. Now the house version, the original house version, yes. I agree with that. The study committee, we did recommend a trigger so that we, in the purpose of that trigger is that patient registry grew. One thing we knew and we understood was as soon as however many licenses were issued, the first thing that the companies were going to start to push for was more demand. And so we felt like if there was a trigger in place as these companies start to push for more demand, well they'd also be pushing for more competition. And in doing so that kind of keeps everything a little bit better in balance. And so that was the only recommendation. The other recommendation the study committee made was that rather than do a strict, vertical vertically integrated process that we did more of a hybrid model. And we had a, we wanted to issue a number again, we didn't put a number on it. We decided to leave that up to the legislature. But we would issue a number of vertically integrated licenses and then a number of individual, grow licenses, a number of individual manufacturing licenses and then a number of individual dispensing licenses. And again that was to do exactly what you want to do is increase competition. And we felt like if we had small businesses competing against large corporations, that's again how you kind of keep everything in check. Well I want to thank you for reminding the committee of the history because you and I were the two losers. Yes. You and I were both in favor of a three tier system, like so many of the other industries in the state that it gives total control and, and scrutiny as to how they operate. But we were both outbooted. Yes. And that kind of day. But I would bring your attention to section eight. Thanks to the illustrious Chairman Brass, some of the issues that he had promoted at that time have made their way through the process. I like it. And this is the language that was put in that would say for future licenses over what is approved that they would be done based on the number of registered cannabis patients in the state. Now the numbers you see here are different than ones in another bill that is floating around. And quite frankly it's because of the number of licenses. But I will go back and submit to you ladies and gentlemen of the committee that we can do nothing and let it sit there and have two basically two monopolies until this is litigated and settled in the courts. Or we can move forward with this. If you look through the rest I didn't get a chance to finish the bill. Before we leave there just on the licenses to be clear on lines 141 and lines 153. Specifically use the word shall issue. So it's no longer a may. A lawyer is another different from me and shall. So this is instructing the commission to give four additional class ones and seven additional class twos. Subject to this limitation of 15 somehow. Correct.

No more than 15, but if they decide that they wanted to clean up their issues over there, then they would give them that authority. And so we're more than doubling the number of licenses that we already have. Six to 15. And just to sort of get in the weeds, there's a lot of talking around the Capitol that this guarantees the nine protesters their licenses. Is that true or not? I don't see that on the Senate's commission. I don't know that there's any guarantee on anything. Is this intended to do that? It is intended to do that. To give them outlet to get rid of the court, get rid of the litigation. What about the other six? What about the contractual? And the contract that was signed by each and every one of these protesters that applied. And by all of them, the 69 or 80, whichever, they signed a contract with the application. That they wouldn't be in broad litigation if they were granted a license. So the quickest way I know to get them out of court is to grant them a license. That free market prevail, and if they're successful, they are, and if they're not, they won't be. What about the 60 that didn't litigate? They're out of the blame. By all the words that I've heard from the bench and from private attorneys and from council, they all say that they did not, if they did not go through the protest that was prescribed by law, because the protest was involved in the law. That was written four years ago. Okay. Were you putting them back in the ball game here or not? Or are they able to fight for these 15 lighted? If they did not file, if they did not file a protest, then they're out of the picture. The head of the new bill. That's exactly what I understand. Senator Dullesall, your recognize. That was going to be my question. We're essentially rewarding the protesters and those that did not, or as you used out of the ball game. Did you contemplate opening up a new application process? If you look further on into the bill, you know, the nine, which would get the commission out of litigation and move it forward. There's another trigger, thanks to Chairman Brass, as I did a few years ago. If you look at it says upon the growth of the registry, there could be other licenses, could be issued. This down section eight. And that would be on section eight. That would be based on the number. All right. Senator, again, I'm going to recognize you for questioning. We're going to have to let a few people be heard here. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm in my three. Go ready. Oh, Representative Powell, you know, I never was very good in chemistry. This bill looks like it's got a lot more merits than those that are in the chemistry side of things. And I don't want to thank you for bringing it. I don't know if the Chairman would allow me to make a motion to do pass right now, but you want to cut off all this public input. We've got a hundred people here that drove from all over the state to be real. I think they all came to see it pass. Quite honestly. I think if we could make a pass, they'd get on with it. Sorry, I was recognizing for question. All right. Go ahead. I'll continue. That's what section eight does. It allows for others based on the on the registry. And I would as a footnote a caveat to that, to your information, it is my belief as well as others. The registry has dropped in numbers. Seven years ago, ladies and gentlemen, we told the people of this state, if you go to a doctor and you're diagnosed with one of these diseases or conditions, then you go to the Georgia Department of Public Health, then you pay them $35 and you have a cannabis card so that you're eligible. But there's been no cannabis available legally in the state of Georgia. Kind of hypocritical to say the very least. So because of that, how many of those the reason the numbers have dropped is who wants to spend good money after bed? That's the hypocrisy of the actions of what has happened. So we're moving forward to that. But we expect that upon the opening of these, you're going to see a rapid increase in the number of people that will be getting their cannabis cards and going to their doctors to be diagnosed. So section nine of this bill is more language that gives exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals to the statewide business court. Same in section 10 and 11. Section 12, financial disclosures that no current member, basically the commission members must file a financial disclosure. And I don't need to go in to why that's in there. Section 13 added the two diseases that I had talked about earlier, ulcerative colitis and mayustinia, grab us. Those were two diseases. And you'll see another one that will appear that I can't even pronounce it at some point during the process if it gets into conference committee. That ladies' enginement is the bill now with the indulgence of the chair, if I may. Go right ahead. This is the bill you have before you. There's a bill that I distributed for the benefit of the members here to look at it there leisure. It's about twice as thick as this. This has got the language of the bill that you see the substitute to Senate Bill 97. The reason that bill is so thick is because that abolishes the cannabis commission and its entirety. And it moves the operations of what the cannabis commission is doing now to the Department of Agriculture, including oversight of House and Senate members to oversee what the operations are. I added another disease that the female members of the House raised their hand in Jubilee. I mean, it was just a number of fewer minor, but then just the same bill. And hopefully if this thing moves forward and it goes into conference, the reason I have thrown that bill out for yours per view at a different time. And that, Mr. Chairman. All right. I'll stand aside. The question is quite a few people signed up. We are on a very strict deadline at noon. So when we have testimony, I'm going to ask folks to try to limit it three to five minutes. I'm going to call some people perhaps out of order to make sure that all few points are heard that I'll get through as many as I can. Senator Lucas, you recognize for a question. Representative Powell. So what 1996 does is to get us in business and get us out of court so we can deal with the cannabis that people have been asking about. The Senate bill 97 does the same thing, but what it also does is abolishes the cannabis commission and puts it in the Department of Agriculture. So that's basically what 97 does is abolish the commission and puts everything in the Department of Agriculture. Yes, sir. Spoken like a man who served in the house, he can just cut it to the chase. All right. He wrote. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Oops, I'm sorry. We do have one commission, Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So I just caught the fact we're adding two diagnoses here, Chairman Powell. So one thing we did back, I can't remember which bill number, but it was the one that actually set up the study committee or actually was a study commission. We added that DPH had to sign off on any diagnoses to add. And then we came back in whatever the number was that set up the whole industry. We came back and said that DPH in conjunction with the Medical Composite Board had to sign off. So it took, there was two checks there. And again, the goal was to get politics out of as far out of this as possible. So I just, I guess, a point of clarification, if you can help me here, when you're adding these two diseases, did you strike through that language anywhere? Because I didn't see that. Maybe that's a ledge council question. How do we add, how are we adding the illness or diagnoses without striking that other language? And I don't see that language in the bill, but I do know it's in the law. To my friend, I think if you go back up to 263 or 265 in there, it has condition on 265 that just basically identifies those. The language you're talking about is probably in the base of the still in the law that was not drafted to show that. So I guess questions for ledge council. Can we add a diagnosis without striking that language? Because I don't know how we could. Again, I'm no lawyer. If I may answer that, we are the general assembly. We are the constitutionally empowered creators of laws. But that into the law. So in order, you're breaking the law to make the law. And so you got to get rid of the law you're breaking. And we have that authority. I'm not saying you don't. I'm just saying if we're going to go by the book here, I think you're going to have to strike that language. Well, I will certainly agree with my friend, but you know, we have certain things that we've had to hear to you like gorp and things. Oh, we're getting rid of gorp. And some of these things may get sort of go by the wayside. Right. Well, look, if you want to get rid of that, I'm just trying to help you out here. If you want to add a diagnosis, I do think you're going to have to strike that language. I don't necessarily agree with that, but that's again, that's your right. And it'd be quite honest in the legislative process. I didn't add these. These are added by other members. Gotcha. As a worthwhile and a necessary disease or a ailment that needed to be in here. Mine was to cure the system. We have a broke system, ladies and gentlemen. And it is an indictment on each and every one of us, irregardless of political party, irregardless of anything to the fact that we as legislators have passed something and it has turned into a major, major issue. And that issue, to me, would be the failure of government to carry out our own policies. All right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm going to call Jeremy Berry from True Leave. You mind speaking from there, do you need to be here? That way you can be on the TV cameras. Everybody home can see it. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and committee. Jeremy Berry on behalf of True Leave, Georgia. I'm going to thank you all for your time today. I'm going to try and be as efficient as possible. I've got a couple of pages and notes and I'll sort of cut to the chase and make the high points. May address a couple of statements that were made today. True Leave, Georgia is a Class I license. We are waiting on a dispensary license and should have product on the shelf, hopefully April 30th or early May at the latest. True Leave has been growing since September, has product ready to go. The six licenses that were awarded can grow enough for two and a half million Georgians. Two and a half million Georgians right now. If we give 15 licenses like a proposed, that's seven and a half million Georgians who would have access to medical cannabis. That will create problems with the black market and the gray market. This isn't something like a restaurant where you have too much supply. We will have too much supply of cannabis and create other unintended consequences. Do you mean using it for purposes other than medical purposes? I don't know what will happen but we're going to have companies growing cannabis and literally nothing to do with it. You would have, our kinds of course would destroy it but it's going to lead other unintended consequences. This bill rewards bad behavior. It would award licenses to company in Class I that came in sixth place, eighth place, ninth place, tenth place, thirteenth, fifteenth and eighth place. It was rigorous competition. Our client came in second place in Class I. Botanical Sciences came in first place in Class I. The protest hearing officer issued 284 pages of decisions. 284 pages of decisions. This is all the judge heard for months where cannabis cases. Some of the decisions were 50 pages long where the judge went through all the record. The licensees and the protestors had access to certain parts of their proposals and could see everybody's proposals. So the idea that this was all done in secret is frankly just not correct because we could see other people's proposals and they could see ours. The protestors had filed 26 lawsuits, 26. Their lawsuits pending at the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, the Georgia Court of Appeals and the Georgia Court of Appeals right now isn't even getting into the merits. It's a procedural question of the proper way to appeal. There are also cases at the Fulton Superior Court and the protestors about two weeks ago filed another lawsuit against the Cannabis Commission and Department of Administrative Services. The protestors knew the rules going in. They played by the rules and now they're upset and they want to do over. All this will do is incentivize future contractors who lose to just go to the legislature. So someone who's bidding on a contract for road paving, if they lose, guess what? It's going to turn this legislature into a de facto evaluation committee for every procurement. I'm unsure what's meant by a monopoly. Yes, there are two companies that have licenses and in due time there will be four more with class two. But by definition, every contract with the state of Georgia is a monopoly. We don't talk about monopolies for road pavers or for whoever runs the IT for the state of Georgia. By definition, every one of those is monopoly. There was competition here. The protestors lost. It is time to move this program on. As I said, truly Georgia will have product on the shelf by April 30th or early May at the absolute latest. Happy to answer any questions you have about the litigation. I'm handling the litigation on behalf of truly if you can answer questions about that or anything else. I recognize Senator Lucas for a question. With your comments, what are you saying to us that we need to just let it go and let the court make a decision and not get any product out? Would it be incumbent upon us as legislators to try to fix this thing and get on with the business so folks are able to get the medical help that they need? Thank you, Senator Lucas. I think what I'm saying a couple things. There was a competition. There were six companies that were identified who met the stringent requirements that looked at security, history, capabilities to perform. Those six companies won. Let the process play out. And if a year or two years or three years from now there needs to be new licenses, then let's figure that out. But all that's happening right now, respectfully, Senator, is rewarding the bad behavior of the protesters who ran the court and stopped the program. There's been no discussion about patients who need the medicine. Our clients signed a contract on September of last year. The patients are ready and they deserve the medicine and we continue to wait and wait and wait and all the protesters want to do is litigate. They don't care about the patients. We are ready to go. So to answer your question, the legislature should, if I were a legislator, if I were a senator in your seat, I would be worried about what this says, not about this procurement respectfully, but the next one. And the next one for the road paving for any state contract because the message it seems to send is tie it up in litigation and go to the legislature. And it doesn't matter what your, the merits of your proposal, those don't matter at all. What matters is whether you can get a bill introduced to award you a contract that you lost. Thank you, I recognize you Senator Dole's offer question. Mr. Chairman, sir, can you tell me how many patients are currently on the list? Approximately 27,000. I think as of March 1st or there about Senator, it's about 27,000. You mentioned a number of 2.5 million for all of the licensees, but in terms of those, it will be producing oil in the next, as you hope it to be six weeks. Likely before this legislation would have any impact. How many patients can be served by the two facilities that are really not available? I've got to look at the number of senators. If you'll give me a minute, I need to check, but I can figure it out. A hundred thousand square feet grows and someone else may have this information. But the class ones can grow up to 100,000 square feet of the cannabis and the class twos can grow up to 50,000. I'd have to check the math. It's sufficient, certainly for all six, to meet the current needs. And obviously, as sort of a chicken and egg issue. My math will put it at a million people if it's, if it's evenly spread out across the square. I think it's, as I do the math in my head. Phone a friend, someone told me it's about 600,000 per class one. Okay. Will both your client and the top bidder that you mentioned that also received the license, will both of those be able to produce oil and sell it by the end of April? Dr. Robin Fowler from Botanical is here and can speak. I can speak for Trulieve. He can speak for Botanical. My assumption is yes, but I'm not sure. Okay. Thank you. All right. Any other questions from committee members? I got well recognized these Senator Summers. Is Trulieve a Canadian company? No sir. Trulieve, Georgia, the licensee is a Georgia company. I think you're trading on the Canadian exchange, though. Is that not correct? The ultimate parent company is traded on the Canadian exchange. You became a Georgia company to get a license. Is that what you're telling me? Come a Georgia company? I'm telling you a Georgia company has the license owned by Georgia. Our CEO is a Georgia resident who's lived here for years. Our members are from Vainbridge, Adele, from all over the state. So the ultimate parent company, just like some of the proposed award, they're curally supposed to get a license under this legislation. They're an international cannabis company. Our client is a Georgia company based in Adele, Georgia, that already is the largest employer in Adele, or soon will be the largest employer in Adele, Georgia, and it's spent millions of dollars in Adele, Georgia, where a Georgia company. All right, thank you. That's all the questions for this time. Vincent Russo, the air true Georgia. Good morning. Vincent Russo, I'm here for the air true Georgia. Thank you all for all that you're doing. Tell you a little bit about the air true. The air true is a company that's made up of over 90% of its residents of Georgia. It's 80% minority owned and managed. The company came in second place for a class two license and came in third place for a class one license. The facility is located in Lewisville, Georgia, in Jefferson County. Now, and I'm happy to speak to the litigation, but the bill, as it is intended, would mean that third place for a class one would be shut out from having a class one license and a company that scored much lower than third true would end up having the option of having a class one or a class two license. We think you've asked about senators, asked about litigation. This bill's not going to end litigation. For starters, none of the litigators have said they're going to dismiss their lawsuits if this bill passes. They don't have any reason to dismiss. So there's that. And second, if we're awarding these protesters by giving them licenses, I think we're creating more litigation by groups. I'm not saying my group would sue, but there are plenty of groups out there that scored higher than the class two protesters. Those protesters range, Jeremy Berry said, gave the class one range for the class two's. It ranges from seventh place to 35th place. These are groups that weren't in the top 50th, 50% tile of the applicants. I'd say this is a highly regulated industry, and we have to promote safety and have safe facilities. And there's a reason why these groups didn't score as high as the groups that ultimately won. Now, litigation, I will say, it's on the tail end. There's one case remaining in Fulton County where there's a rid of surgery area case, and there's a super serious in effect in that case. And that is effectively the only case that's holding up the licensing process for the class two's. Theratru, they've spent millions of dollars in Lewisville building out its facility, acquiring the facility and building it out. They're ready to go as soon as that license gets issued. We are going to be one of the largest, if not the largest, employer in Lewisville. And we're going to have a great partner to both Lewisville and Jefferson County for economic development going forward. So you lost out on one of the class one licenses? We did. When did you get a class two license? That's correct. But we did not protest the class one process, of course. So that's kind of the point. We'd be stuck with the 50,000 square foot facility because we didn't protest coming in third place for a class one facility, where some group that came in, I think, seventh place, as Mr. Barry was saying, that group would get a class one license under this legislation. Were you satisfied with that bidding process that Chairman Powell has mentioned some of the secrecy? Well, I disagree to the secrecy. These groups went to OSA, the governor appropriated funds, so that an OSA judge could hear the cases, the protests, and move them forward. There were 14 class two protests. Judge Howell, who's the OSA judge, he was appointed as the hearing officer. She not only held hearings, the parties briefed the issues. She directed the parties to disclose mostly unredacted versions of the application schedules that issue, and when I say mostly, I mean, they were probably about 99% unredacted in those schedules. She found issued extensive orders, found that the plaintiffs or the protesters, I should say, couldn't meet their burden, that the scoring was appropriate, that there were ample bases for the commission scoring that they issued for all of the parties, and the groups lost. And then they filed the lawsuits. They initially filed under the administrative procedures act, and that's how they got a TRO initially, which was subsequently vacated in each of them, when they were exparteed TROs. So we weren't even there to be able to state our side of the story. And the state wasn't there either, which was problematic, because they were their party. But in the interim, the groups also filed surgery re-petitions under Title V, and under Title V, when you filed that petition, it has a super-seedious effect. And so because of that, the commission, the TROs got, the state's excuse me, not the TROs, the states were vacated, but the super-seedious effect and the appeals has held it up. Now, I believe there are five of those, four of those groups have dismissed, voluntarily dismissed their cases. And they're putting, sitting inside the marriage, they have several procedural problems with their cases, which I suspect is the reason why they dismissed. But there's one left, where it's waiting for a decision on motions to dismiss, and then a final hearing on the merits, if we get that far. We are confident that we will win all of litigation if it proceeds to find a frame on that. How long do you think that would take to get to? Well, as we all know, it's difficult to predict how the courts are going to move. We have a very good judge in Fulton County with the cert cases, or the cert case, the last one left. It's not set for a final hearing. We have pending motion to dismiss, and there are appeals to the court of appeals also on those APA issues. But that's a procedural issue as to whether they're contested. How close is your client to producing product? Are client can't produce any? They can't bring clients into the state until they have a license. So, we've got a facility that's built out. We've got employees who are ready to go. How many patients do you think your client, would you say it was their true? How many could they serve as? My understanding is, I don't know how many they can serve. I don't have a precise number. I think that when we ballparked it as the 400,000, there's basically 400,000 square feet of canopy space under the laws that exist. So, two class ones at 100,000 square feet each. Four class twos at 50,000 square feet each. It brings us to the 400,000 number. We anticipated that there would have to be over about three quarters of a million people on the registry before there was ever any need to look at expansion. And then that was based on our analysis of Florida and the percentage of the population that was on Florida's registry at the time we did that analysis. Senator Kennedy, you're recognizing that's for question. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Forgive me, I think you'd explain this, but so you had your company was denied a class one license, is that right? That's correct. It you chose not to litigate that issue. That's correct. And you have been awarded a class two license. That's correct. Well, it's not awarded yet, but it's got the notice of a ward, of intent to award. So, in what litigation matter is your company a party then? We're defendants, respondents in almost all of the cases. The protesters did file one new lawsuit about, I don't know, maybe three weeks ago, four weeks ago, that...

We thought a motion to intervene as a defendant and that motion hasn't been, it's still being briefed. So, but we're a party because we're one of the recipients of, we're one of the prospective licensees, so that's why we're a party. Gotcha. We're not, we're not the ones bringing the lawsuits. We are not the ones holding up, holding up this process that we are on the other side of that. Okay. And we've involved in producing cannabis elsewhere before now. No, the company, the company has not, now we have individuals we've brought in to be part of the company, that have been involved in companies elsewhere. And I ask that question, is it lead into, can you speak to what has happened with people that are associated with your company when they've introduced cannabis into a state for the first time? How does the pricing for the product work when it hits the market of a state or a market where there has not been cannabis sold before? I would have to go back to my client and talk to them about their pricing. I'm just a lawyer, I don't know that part. Sure. And I get that. And so, that really is, my, my, my, my wonderment is, and I wondered if you can speak to the issue of that we hear from some, that to limit the number of producers is going to necessarily mean that the price for the product is going to be higher. And conversely, if there are more producers, that is competition, that the price for the product will probably be lower irrespective of whether or not what the demand is or the capacity, because I think we're hearing from everyone that the capacity is going to be greater than the current demand and maybe even the perceived demand for the foreseeable future. You have any thoughts on that? Yeah. I mean, look, I, I, there's obviously some supply and demand. We know economics generally around that and how that affects pricing. I'm not, I'm not sure how, you know, if we add more licenses, how that would ultimately affect pricing, because you know, you've got your own dispensaries. There are also pharmacies, the independent pharmacies who can, who can sell. I think the flip side here though is when you start adding more facilities, how does that affect the ability to regulate and for the state to do its job of regulating these entities? How big is the staff going to be? How, that that's going to have to be expanded with the commission so that inspections are able to be done? I mean, it's not a, we're not open in convenience stores here although, you know, there's more to it. And so, so I think that's the flip side is as you start having more facilities, how does that impact the ability to actually oversee to make sure that the security around the facilities, there's not product going out the back door. We address this in the applications, which is, you know, some, one of the reasons we scored high and some of the other groups didn't score as high. But, you know, I think we need to have the program get started and we can see what the prices are. We haven't even gotten to the point of being able to figure out dispensaries because we don't have a license. And, you know, the landlord's won't give you a, let's you at least space in their, you know, in their buildings if you don't have a license. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. No further questions for you. Thank you. Mr. Michael Mumper, GRMP. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, Senator. My name is Michael Mumper. I'm the executive director of Georgians for Responsible Marijuana Policy. I want to make three points. One is I want to thank Senator Brass for reminding us that any new conditions for medical marijuana need to be approved by the Department of Public Health and the Composite Medical Board. Secondly, I want to request that we consider local control on where dispensaries get located. Those communities, even in blue states, when given the option, choose not to have a dispensary in their backyard. Yeah, I can tell you in my county, in Fayette County, that's almost certainly going to be true that we're not going to want it in our backyard. We're planning to do surveys, independent surveys to get the right will of the people on that, but we want to ensure that we would have that option. I know that one of the largest recovery community organizations in the state of Georgia is right next door in New NIN. And their executive director is not excited about having a dispensary in their backyard. As the train we're on with marijuana could lead to long-term dependency issues. So marijuana is intoxicating and it is addictive. And we have to remember that, even as when we're here in the state capital calling it a medicine, it is addictive and it is intoxicating. The last point I'd like to make is that I agree that even granting these new licenses can create a lot more problems than we're purportedly solving. And being that the six licensees will be able to produce far more medical marijuana oil than is currently needed by the 26 or 27,000 Georgians. Granting nine more licenses is creating more risk for diversion for unintended purposes. And I think that's a market we would not want to engender in any way. And secondly, the Georgia Medical Cannabis Commission added to their rules last month that new applications for dispensaries, one of the criteria would be to demonstrate demand. If we already know that the six licensees can make more than enough, I don't know how the new application process is going to meet that criteria, unless they're granted de facto. And I'm not clear on what the status of that application is for the next round. That's my testimony, any questions? Thank you, you have no questions. Oh, all right, we got them. Another filibuster, here we go. Not a filibuster. I do want to clarify though, my comments on the, I looked up on the recommendations from DPH and Medical Composite Board, they only make recommendations. It's not required. And so I did want to clarify that. I went back and looked it up. Now the intent was not captured. I will say that the intent was, but I do also since you referenced noon and as the elected official of the city of noonin, which is where I live, I don't think you have a right to speak on behalf of noonin. And me as an elected official from noonin, I do, and I do know that there's, they are currently looking, there are some looking to put a dispensary in noonin. And as the elected official of noonin, I support having one there so that patients have access to medical THC. Thank you. Good question. Fair. All right, Kristen Goodman. Symphony Medical and Pure Peach. Thank you so much. I know that the time is short and there are many others that are here to speak. Many others, in fact, just about every attorney that could represent one of the purported winners has shown up today. And my big question is why? Why are they here? Nothing in this legislation takes away their licenses. Nothing. Nothing affects their operation. Nothing affects their licenses. They're here for two reasons, two words. Money and market share. Okay. Each of these winners should they get a license is concentrated in the central part of the state of Georgia. They are free to locate their dispensaries in the central part of the state of Georgia in the most populated parts of the state of Georgia where they will be able to utilize their monopolies that they intend and have come here today to protect. Why are we here? Why am I here? I am leading the litigation of the protesters. I can speak to the fact that if this legislation passes, all of that litigation is moot. So therefore, if this legislation passes and the protesters do receive licenses, there will be no more litigation. I can tell you that the reason I'm here, the reason my clients are still here, the reason you guys took the courageous step when you did in 2015 and 2019 to bring relief to the millions of suffering people in this state, many of whom have come here today to plead with you to do the right thing. You did it. You did it then and you made a promise. This is about promises. It's about promises made and promises broken. We promised to bring a medication to not just those located or who could reach a dispensary. We promised to bring this medication to suffering, Georgians, in all four corners of this state, not those in central Georgia, not those who could drive two hours to get to it. We promised it would be available to the veterans in southwest Georgia with phantom pain, to the children in northeast Georgia, suffering debilitating seizures. The parents, so many of us in this room are parents. We would do anything for our children, but when the access and the affordability is denied, we cannot. We have broken our promise to those citizens who are not served by the current status of this legislation. You have heard both privately and here today what a disaster this procurement process was. You have heard about the scores and the ranking, all of which depends on the validity of the process that was not valid. This is not about those scores. This is about any qualified organization who has demonstrated a commitment to serve the people in the far reaches of the state of Georgia and bring them this much needed medication. The issues with the procurement process, the lack of transparency, how anybody could stand before you and say that this was a transparent process is frankly mind blowing. There was nothing transparent about the process and nothing transparent about the applications submitted by the people who have stood before you today. The promise that we made, the promise that we made as protesters, was that we would participate in a process that we were promised by Georgians and for Georgians. The companies that have appeared for you today are telling you they are Georgia companies. They are multi-state operators who are hoping to expand their logistic footprint for when this is decriminalized on a federal level. They want Georgia to become a hub in their wheel of distribution and that is not what the protesters are about. These are small companies who have promised to locate their facilities and their dispensaries where people need them in the far reaches. Would you and your clients support this legislation if we simply scrapped the licenses altogether and reopened the bidding process for all the 69 people? If that is what it takes to ensure the integrity of the process and the integrity of the companies who receive those licenses and the promise they make to serve those people in the outlying sections of the state of Georgia, then that is what we will do. This has been a, we don't think that is the best solution because by the end of the day it keeps Georgians waiting. These people in this room have already been waiting for years and that is unnecessary and a new procurement and to that point Senator. We don't have to have you close an argument. We're not in court. We've got ten minutes left. So what I can tell you is that if there is a new procurement then that is what will happen. We will be waiting for another several years on new licenses, on any licenses, whatsoever. And we are ready as protesters, as are the people who have already gotten their licenses. We have the support of local officials. We have building plans. We have property purchased and we are ready to go tomorrow. Those who opted out of the process to the point of some of the questions asked earlier are not ready to go. They made a decision to back out. If I could just offer you some statistics, not a closing argument. Okay. Well, the statistics that I want to offer to you are about where we look to determine how these dispensaries are going to grow and how many licenses are appropriate to serve those. Six was a random number that was chosen out of the gate. We look to other states, Florida, Missouri, Arkansas, all of whom are limited to medicinal use, all of whom have over 15 licenses, over 20 licenses, which have adequately supported with no black market. In fact, a black market is created by a shortage, not by excess. We believe in the state. We believe in the committee and that it can be regulated properly and that with that appropriate regulation, every individual who needs this medication will get it. The shareholders of those multistate operators will be fine. If this legislation is not passed, the citizens of the state of Georgia will not be. And I ask this committee to do the right thing to keep the promises it made to the Georgia companies and the Georgia citizens who need this medication. Thank you very much. Thank you, Derek Bauer, FFB. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll be very brief. I am counsel to one of the winning licensees, FFD. This is a Macon based company that is a class two awardee. It was the second highest scoring candidate overall for this procurement and the highest class two scoring candidate. I think the only thing we all agree on is we want to get medicine to the patients as quickly as possible. But the bill in front of you and the substitute bill that Chairman Powell described is going to have the exact opposite effect. Both the pretext for that bill that the process is broken and the notion that in the litigation are both demonstrably false. I want to start with very briefly that this process is broken, that somehow government failed this process. It worked exactly as this body designed it. We designed a system for new entrants to a nascent market that is highly regulated, highly specialized in which there are a few people around the world that have this experience to submit as much information to the commission as possible in a protected forum so that commission would have the best information. Who are the most qualified? Who knows how to do this? Who's going to keep it safe? Who knows how to distribute it? Who knows how to protect against downstream flaws in distribution, to protect against the problems that you've heard about? That was the process you designed. 69 or 70 applicants followed it to a letter for six licenses. There were going to be losers. Here's how we know the process worked. Every one of the complaints you've heard from Chairman Powell, who's very passionate about it and I appreciate it. And for Ms. Goodman, who's company, the symphony that you just heard from, by the way scored 18th out of 69. That company was nowhere close to being qualified for this procurement. Every single one of those arguments was made exhaustively to an independent, almost two decades serving administrative law judge who's faithfully served the state in that capacity for almost 20 years. She heard evidence, she heard argument, she heard briefing, she unredacted all of the information in the commission. She had unfettered access to everything the commission looked at and did as did every protestor and she rejected all of it. This is an ALJ who has no dog in the fight. She had one job that the governor appropriated funds for. Look at these protests and rule on them fairly. And she rejected each and every one of these arguments that you've heard that the process was flawed. These protestors had their day in court and they have a right to appeal it and that's where it stands now. We've got in front of Judge Krauss on the Fulton Superior Court, she will review on an appellate basis whether the administrative law judge got it right or wrong when she rejected every single one of those arguments for every single one of these protestors. She looked at their challenge, you heard Mr. Powell say, chairman Powell say, the scoring was random. It didn't make any sense. Every protestor argued that and the ALJ had access to all of that data. She looked at every bit of it and said, nope, the commission got it right in every single one of these cases. And now that's going to be reviewed by a Fulton Superior Court judge who's also independent and that review is imminent. This process, the litigation will end in due course very soon and this whole thing, this whole procurement will get medicine into the patient's hands quickly. Here's what happens, Mr. Chairman, if I may, if you pass this bill. It is prohibited under the Georgia Constitution for the General Assembly to award special legislation to the protestors. It's going to immediately draw a lawsuit if not from the winning applicants who will have their market undermined from everyone who didn't protest because they recognized the process was in fact fair and objectively followed. Georgia Constitution Article 3, Section 6, paragraph 4 prohibits this body from passing legislation to specifically reward individual protestors with licenses. Immediately this gets shut down in court by any other applicant who didn't win a license who wants to. If our goal is to get the medicine to the patients, let this process run its course. Let the medicine get out with those at the commission and judge howls and soon a Fulton Superior Court judge will say are the most qualified companies to do it. And then next year, if there's a need for more, let these protestors and anyone else who wants to come and show their qualified attempt to demonstrate their qualified. But right now, the only thing holding up to procurement are the protestors who've already lost their day in court. And this bill is only going to set that process back. I'd let you win your case and your protest are gone. We got six licenses. Do you think we need more or not? I don't know how you could decide at this point that you do. I think you need to let the market develop as you designed it to develop and see. Right now, you have 27,000 patients on the registry. Everyone acknowledges that the six licenses are going to produce way more than that registry could possibly support. How much do you think they'll produce? I don't know the answer to that question. I think we all know that based on the mathematical estimates, which is all we have since the market doesn't exist yet, that we're looking at enough product for over a million patients based on the six licensees once they're up and running. I think the body needs to wait. Give it a year. See how many patients join the registry. See if we have a market problem. Then add licenses. Okay. That's how the process is supposed to work. Appreciate your testimony. Thank you so much. Thank you all. I'm Robyn Fowler. We're running quickly out of time. Good morning. I'll be very brief, Chairman, and thank you, Seniors, for listening to us. I'm Robyn Fowler. I'm a physician that's been trained in Georgia since 2000. I trained in Emory. And I say that just to try to validate the point, the botanical science. In addition to being the number one scoring company, we scored a 970 out of 1,000 at the end of the year. I'm sorry to tell you I'm the founder of botanical sciences. Botanical science is rooted in medicine. We're focused on patient access. We're focused on patient care. Currently we have around 200 formulations for disease states. When we're talking about going to market or what have you, very simply, you're really looking at 100 days from seed to cell. So whenever product is going to be available before, excuse me, at the beginning of the summer, let's say, for patients, then we're going to look at access. We're looking at affordability and competition. And I'd like to try to directly answer those and then make myself available for questions. Access, I want to give you more of a five-year look. If you currently look at the law and you look at the dispensing license per 10,000, the six awarded license, which by the way, we certainly don't have any objections to all six going out. I mean, they're awarded, excuse me, awarded. But that will produce approximately 150 dispensaries. The law also providing for independent pharmacies, which are governed by the pharmacy board, currently has 800 in a state. We're working very actively on the dispensing side to make sure that patients have access. It doesn't matter which corner of Georgia they're in. I just want to make that very, very clear. Tactical science is located in Glenville, Georgia, economic poverty, unemployment 28% just as the law subscribes. But that being said, this whole idea of us being right in the middle of the city is just incorrect. We're 208 miles. In the packet, there are some graph depictions of five years. I think the gist is when you look at other states and we'll look at Florida, for example, that range is around 3%. So I want to try to get you a background where some of these numbers come. 3% and 3% of Georgia would be 360,000. Now your average per state that's medical is around 2%. If the projections would be to follow the average median, Georgia would land between 250 and 300,000 patients for the 12 million. Medical sciences can take care of an estimated 300,000, which plays into the total numbers that we've been discussed earlier, 1.2 million. So I wanted to just make that very clear and try to ask any questions because there just seems to be a lot of gray zone amongst what the current licensors, I guess I could say, could provide. So I want to make myself available for that. So you think as one class, one licensee you could provide for more than the projected future need of the entire state. Excuse me. Let me make sure I'm clear. Currently, I'm going to round off the figures to 30,000. So just mathematically, the class runs could take care of more than 10 times out of out of patients. Just roll it up to a million. Correct. Then with the addition of the other four, it will basically quadruple that, well, the original number, which is the 1.2. It changes the canopy as easily seen from 400,000 square feet to a million. So it's consistently, and it could take the dispensary number from 150 that are regulated by the agency to up to 450. And that's completely independent number from the independent pharmacies, which obviously is covered by the ward. Are you able to sell to these independent pharmacies? Yes, we can. And are any of them expressing an interest in doing that? Are they worried about these federal licenses, et cetera? There are questions that have come up. And we've just had to address those straightforward. We've been in discussions with the DEA. We've had site visits from Georgia narcotics from the DEA. We've worked very closely to make sure that the arrangements have been between the lines. And the pharmacy board have been, everybody's been very cooperative. So when we're talking about all these barricades, I just don't agree, just that simply. We have two companies that are ready to go to market. I don't see it as monopoly. If there's one company, I'd say it as monopoly. But out of the two companies, we're going to be respectfully competing. So prices are going to be an issue. And if there's going to be another five, so when I choose, oh, sorry. Some states have minimum floors and maximum prices you can sell to prevent the abuse of the customer for lack of competition. You got a problem with that. I wouldn't necessarily say I have a problem with it. I mean, I haven't really looked at that as an option because what we have based everything on is national numbers. I mean, I'm a physician. We're not looking at gouging patients. Potentical science, for example, it has hardship programs, just like we do in medicine. So it doesn't matter the patient's income. It doesn't matter the patient's location. Taking care of that patient is a goal of technical science. You have programs that will make the medicine cheaper for those that can't afford it. Like, center summers, I recognize you for a quick question. Thank you, Mr. Duffauer. Not a foul, sir. Are you growing currently? Yes, sir. You have 100,000 square foot facility in Glenville, Georgia. We have 160,000 square foot facility in Glenville, Georgia. We're currently growing. Yes. So you're currently growing marijuana, currently growing it? Yes, sir. And you're saying you could bring product to the market by April? That was the other gentleman. I'm saying early summer. You will say June. We'll say June. What has kept you from doing that so far? Make me understand exactly what it says you had in license. Even though the law says it should go on, what has kept you from doing that? Well, the license wasn't issued two years ago. We were tied up in court for a year, which kept us from growing. So once the license was issued, we had proper inspections by the commission. We're growing. And then we do not yet have dispensaries because the dispensary process is just now being granted. Believe it, April, when there will be expecting dispensary license. So that's why I'm giving you the projection of the gene. All right. Thank you so much. Thanks for being with us today. We've got one more I promise you'll end up being that she's been here for three. Henderson. You're letting you spoke yesterday. So I'm going to call on the doctor first. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. I'm sorry. My phone is ringing. Oh, my God. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm Dr. Lee. You should be this morning. My name is Dr. Yolanda Henderson. I am a United States Army veteran. I served on Iraqi Freedom for this country. And I am a doctor of naturopathy that studies herbal vitamins, minerals, nutrients. I have a short testimony about my disease or disorder that I suffered serving this country. I'm a multiple, sorry, multiple sclerosis survivor. To this month is multiple sclerosis awareness month. I am wearing orange in honor of those who are fighting this terrible disorder. You got an opinion on House Bill 196. I do. I do. Sure, I have an opinion. My opinion was that this should go and be revised at a later date. But patients like myself are in need and have been waiting for medical cannabis in this state for quite some time. Under what I came up with is that there is a high demand. I am also the owner of the Atlanta Georgia Academy of Cannabis Science, where we talked and briefed on the licenses, the laws, the rules, and the benefits of getting the license, how to apply. We consulted in the state of Georgia under our classes and we came to Georgia with the opportunity to help those who were Georgians to get the license and to be successful in their licensure process. We also came up with the numbers that it would actually take 100 dispensaries at 100,000 square foot of the classroom licenses to meet the demands.

one out of every 10 persons takes advantage of the use of medical cannabis as their medication. The math is very simple. That 3,150 times the 1 point or the 1,000 or 1 million people in Georgia that has access or don't have access to the medical cannabis at this time, that there will need 3,276,000 dollars. The numbers may stagger anyone's imagination that this could be the economic potential of the implementation of the Haley's Hope Act and that was back when Haley's Hope Act was in legislation. So obviously for this to happen in the industry will have to have or to be fully operational as a validation of this type of revenue. We recommend that the Mayo Clinic recommends that for epilepsy for the most part patients are recommended to take 300 milligrams of CBD oil per day, which is 9 grams a month and at 50 dollars per gram. If you're lucky to find that low of a price, this equals to $450 a month or 5,400 per year. In addition, we stated that if a pound of medical cannabis in Georgia imitates the average price per pound in the rest of the country for the state of Georgia to fulfill the demand, it will have to produce a minimum of 1,755,000 pounds a year, which in a population of a million patients only equates to 1.67 pounds per patient. And I'm saying this as a number that will be increasing with the laws changing to adapt to the medical cannabis benefits. I teach in our courses as a doctor that there are over 2,000 maybe health ailments that medical cannabis can treat, including multiple sclerosis. And it's not just per in stage, it's per the beginning stage because at end stage, you're almost dead. Basically by that time, we have an endocannabinoid system that becomes deficient and those cannabinoids that we get from these plants will provide relief that we need at the beginning stage at an early stage of a preventative, which is what I learned in my courses and my class and education degree that preventive medicine is going to help with overall health and wellness opportunities. Before they get to the medical hospitals, before they get to these places where they're going to need the medications that we have not banned or that have caused side effects that have been tremendous to a lot of our health. As a PTSD survivor, been on opioids and have suffered opioid addiction due to the opioids mean overly recommended by physicians or doctors in the medical industry. Now I have no objections and I do not want to say that medical is against all medical because we need, we have accidents and we have opportunities for anesthesiology and things like that. I have been to the hospital and had to have anesthesia a couple of times so I appreciate the medical industry. My case and my point is that we have to understand that there are going to be people who would rather have a better quality of life with medical cannabis and holding up in court and legislation have taken me away from being able to go into the pharmacy or go into the dispensaries wherever and be able to get a preventative medication that will help my diagnosis be minimal as possible and that's my testimony. Thank you for your time. Appreciate you being here. Go land. I told you you could speak briefly. Do you want to speak again to the day or do you get your say yesterday? All right. If you will make your two points I'm going to let Chairman Powell close. I'm going to speak. Once again, I'm going to introduce myself. I'm Ylinda Bennett from Georgia Medical Cannabis Society, co-founder and operations manager. We are 510-399 profit and the two points that I wanted to make to include in this. It's about since the medical cannabis cards have been available, patients have been having to pay every two years for a cannabis card. They've been having to pay for evaluations for the card which ranges from $150 to $450 for evaluations. Some doctors require you to come back between three to six months as a follow-up for them to go ahead and keep your medical cannabis card active. I thank you Dr. Fowler for speaking on something that I was going to ask about programs for indigence patients because that's what our organization was founded on because we were concerned about the patients being able to afford this product. So that's those are my points and the ten years are... If you all could have some type of subsidies for the different ones that awarded the licenses so they won't incur these fees, the extra fees just provide more access for those who cannot afford the product because it's not covered by insurance. There are very few physicians here in Georgia that allow healthcare insurance to pay for the evaluation. There's not a listing of physicians. I've contacted the DPH trying to find a listing of the physicians who conduct the medical cannabis license. I'm not... I know what you mean, the register. Yeah, evaluation. If we had the list of doctors who actually conduct the evaluation that will give us more access for the patients. And with us, I answered the phone calls, broken at the time when people call us looking for a doctor who conducts the medical cannabis evaluation. I've gotten cussed out because yes, and I don't like it. They're taking out what Georgia hasn't provided for the patients only. I've sat on the phone call and I just listened because I understand their frustration because I got frustrated when I tried to contact the Georgia cannabis access community. And I attempted to contact them. All you get is a recording. There are no listings on the doctor. That's why they come to us and asking us. It's like we're having to do some research to try and find these doctors. So you're not pleased with the performance of the commission either? No, I am not pleased with them. The transparency is needed. And like I said, hey, we're fine with me personally. I'm fine with it. The thing about it is, what is it that they had the redacted forms? What do they have to hide? You don't care about the trade secrets or anything like that. The only thing that we pretty much care about right now is getting our minutes because the longer we wait, the more we're going to end up incurring more fees for paying for evaluations, paying for the card over here, what does that mean? Go. I hate to cut you off, but there are members in this committee that are keeping them from having a quorum and insurance and are killing house bills every minute we speak because I only have a date on their list today. All right. All I need you to wrap up for us. There are just a few people left that I didn't reach and I apologize. I think we got the general flavor of the pros and the cons of. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and ladies and gentlemen committee. And I'll sit here and I've listened to the debate and all through the committees that we've been through. And I said here today that I listened and we have members of this distinguished committee. That are attorneys. Y'all know better than anyone, the reason that people have rights to file litigation. That's part of our system of justice. When there's been an injustice done, they have a right to file. Now I will tell you, I listen to the attorneys. And I've learned a lot. As an on attorney, I've learned a lot. But I was rather discurdious to some of them and I apologize in the house judiciary. I said that I'd like to see this circus again on a different platform. But these folks are hired. Three good attorneys that I listen that are representing the folks that's already been granted a license. They're going to be into the business. They're going to be into the business. They're representing to defend them anopoly or doopoly. One of the companies that didn't, hasn't, that's been held up in the class too. They're going to be a monopoly also. Now what's right? The folks that were protesters, they had a right to file suit and they did so. You the attorneys know that to be a right. Y'all also know that it's the right of these other attorneys. If they had been reached out too first, they would have been hired by the protesters. So you know, that's the nature of the game. But it's turned into a legal situation. I go back to what I said to start with. There was faulty process by the Cannabis Commission. Dr. Fowler, I met with him. I met with probably a dozen of the folks during the process that we were doing this. And I admire him. I admire him. He hired consultants, members of the legislature who in their testimony admitted that. I'm not an investor. I'm not a consultant to none of these folks. I could care less except for the fact that the integrity of the legislative process want to rise. I heard certain comments on here about the threat from one of the attorneys that they're going to file because it's unconstitutional. Ladies and gentlemen of this committee, we are the legislature. We come into session on the second Monday of every January to fix issues that we didn't do right or something that some alternative fell into place. We have that right. And I take it as an insult to be threatened on the God-given right that we're elected to do. And I would appreciate that. But this is about litigation. This is about the monopolies. I like all these folks. But even Dr. Fowler's application under the strict interpretation of the rules that we put forth, they would have been disqualified because they were within a certain distance of a church. And they didn't get outside of that distance until the last year of the session when that happened. And I point that out to me as menacequiel. But that's what I'm talking about. There were so many things that were done that was wrong in the evaluation and the faulty process, ladies and gentlemen. Now, do I care that there's 15 or 20 or 6? Now, that's irrelevant. That was by act to the General Assembly. But this bill spells forth as I go back to what I said at the start of my presentation. This goes back to the facts that if we want to fix the system or we want to let it stay tied up in litigation for six months, 12 months, two years, I don't know. But I know that for every one of those applicants, if they're granted a license today, it'll take them well over a year to year and a half to even build out to start producing. That's how much time we're talking about, ladies and gentlemen. This is a fix. The substitute to the Senate Bill 97 gave his another fix. It just moves in general terms. It just moves it out of the cannabis commission and it moves it to the Department of Agriculture. And I'm sure that most everybody here has full faith in confidence in an elected official running the Ag Department. After all, he was trained in the Senate and he knows how to get things done. And that's the whole purpose. Whichever, whatever the wish is of, be glad to ask, answer any other questions. But if not, I'll step aside because we don't want to kill any valuable house bills in the insurance committee. All right. So here's what we're going to do. We're going to have to adjourn for the day to meet for the other, our other obligations of other committees. We're scheduled for the same room tomorrow morning, same time 10 a.m. Representative Cox, I'm sorry. The clock ran out on you, but you will be on the agenda tomorrow to see if the committee wants to take any action on your bill. Mr. Chairman, I am going to take under advisement the other committee sub that you put on a Senate bill and those concepts. I'm going to look at these. I'm going to take further input from my committee members. I am going to make some tweets and come up with a little committee sub. I don't know right now what's going to be in it. I know that you've got some very good pieces of yours that you will see in it for sure. I don't know until I talk to the leadership and the lieutenant governor later today exactly what'll be in it, but I will share it with you before anybody else. And we will hear it tomorrow morning. It may be tomorrow morning four comes out of legislative council there swamped as you can imagine. I'm going to do the same thing on the hemp bill. We've heard all the testimony on that we need really some interesting this morning from the lab and having no going conversations with our leadership. So we will be ready to take action on both of those bills in the morning and with that we are adjourned.
