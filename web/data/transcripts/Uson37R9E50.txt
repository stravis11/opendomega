Carter has asked us to do today, so we'll do that. So if you'll stay on the floor, we have some important business that we need to tend to immediately after the chaplain, so you should be here anyway. So if you remain, we'll take that photo. As is our custom, we will begin our day with Scripture reading in prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain today will be introduced by the lady from the 147th House District Representative Bethany Ballard. Representative Ballard. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. It's my honor to introduce my minister from Perry, United Methodist Church, Tom Carey. He's been our senior pastor for a couple of years now. And he and his wife, Shelly, have brought so much life and freshness into our church. They're the first couple we've had, and well over a decade, who have young children at our church, and I've enjoyed working with them and the children in the youth department. His girls are Holland and Olivia, who is here as my page today, Presley, and they have a very young son to your old DAX, who is wonderful. And I enjoy being in his wife, Shelly's ladies Sunday school class. They are a wonderful family of faith, who live out their faith as a family. And Tom is a graduate of Duke University, which personally I find a little bit unfortunate, since I went to the Good Basketball School of the Road in Chapel Hill. He got his master's degree from Emory University, and I am so thankful that he is leading our church. And I hope you enjoy hearing from him as much as I enjoy hearing from him every Sunday morning. So it's my honor to introduce Tom Carey. Good morning. Good morning. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, members of the House. The only time I've been more nervous speaking is at my daughter's school. I spoke to all the six through 12th graders in the gym. That was more nerve-wracking than you guys, but you're second. It's an honor to be here and represent Peary Georgia. And we love Peary. We love our church. You know, I love Bethany. She's incredible. And I know, I hope you know how great she is, but she has such a leader in our community and in our church. I want to read a scripture for those of you that are Christian, you know, our story is about Jesus. And he died on the cross. He rose from the dead. His disciples kind of look like bumbling fools, which I'm glad they leave that in, right? Because that's how I feel most of the time. And there was a lot of jockeying for position, and then Jesus would kind of put them in their place. Peter, James, and John are the big three. But even those guys would try to fight for the chair of the committee of appropriations, right? That doesn't happen anymore, right? You know, they would fight for power. And Jesus had, of course, a different way of looking at power. Well, Peter, as you know, denies Jesus. He's at the worst moment. He falls flat on his face. Jesus predicted this would happen. And so after the resurrection, Peter and the others say, I'm going fishing. And maybe you know this story in John 21 and Jesus meets Peter on the beach. Do you love me? Do you love me? Do you love me? Feed my sheep? Feed my lambs? Feed my sheep? You may remember this, but after those words, Jesus said to Peter, feed my sheep. In verse 17 of John 21, feed my sheep. Very truly, I tell you, when you were younger, you dressed yourself and went where you wanted. But when you were old, you will stretch out your hands and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go. Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. Then he said to him, follow me. Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said, Lord, who is going to betray you. When Peter saw him, he asked, Lord, what about him? Jesus answered, if I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? You follow me. The word of God for the people of God, thanks be to God. All the Episcopal's and Catholics and Methodists know what to do at that moment. Sorry. I love that story so much. It's this great moment of redemption and then right after it, Jesus is giving Peter the scoop, hey, when you were young, you went where you wanted. You dressed yourself and you did what you wanted. But as you get older, somebody else is going to make you go where you don't want to go. Anybody feel that way? Anybody feel like you're in the second half of life and you wake up and somebody's telling you where to go and it's not where you want to go. I know some of you already today have had to go places that you didn't want to go and it's not even 10 o'clock, right? Or not even 11. I know you can relate to that. Of course, Jesus is talking about Peter is going to ultimately die like Jesus had to die on the cross. Peter was crucified as well. He means this literally, but I also think it works in a spiritual sense that as we grow, as we mature in our walk of life and our calling, as we grow up, it's not all about what we want. We have to learn to do the things we don't want to do. I know that you're missing a beloved colleague today and I can't imagine that, right? So it's in our minds that life is short, right? We know that we're only here for a little bit of time. Isn't it amazing after that beautiful moment on the beach of redemption? And he says, Peter, come follow me. And he says, when you're young and then when you're old and then Peter, what's he say to that? Not thank you Lord. Not I'm going to follow you. He said, what about him? Still jockeying for position. Peter and John had a little bit of a thing. And even at this moment, Peter is worried about the other guy. What about him looking over his shoulder and what does Jesus say? Essentially, what about him? It's not about him. If I got plans for him, it doesn't matter. It's about you follow me. Jewish Rabbi named Zusia. Before his death, Rabbi Zusia said, in the coming world, they will not ask me why were you not Moses? They will ask me why were you not Zusia? Another theologian Oscar Wilde said, be yourself. Someone else has already taken. Friends, every one of you in this room I know is a leader. You've been sent here by your representatives, by your constituents, right? And you're doing great work. You are here for a purpose. Every single one of us has a calling. I believe a divine calling that's led you to this moment. We don't need you to be somebody else. Maybe you've got heroes in your life at home or heroes in politics that you would aspire to be like. And that's great. But you're not called to be somebody else. You're called to be you. God has a calling on your life that leads you to this moment. So my prayer for you and for me today is that we won't look over our shoulder today and go, but what about them? What about her? What about him? God is calling you. Yes, it may include having someone else take you somewhere you don't necessarily want to go. That's okay. He's got something for you to do. Would you pray with me this morning? As I pray, I want to quote one more theologian, Dr. Seuss. Today you are you. That is truer than true. There is no one alive who is you or than you. Shout aloud, I am glad to be what I am. Thank goodness I'm not a ham or a clam or a dusty old jar of gooseberry jam. I am what I am what a great thing to be. If I say so myself, happy every day to me. Dear God, thank you that you have called each one in this room. We have breath in our lungs and that is a gift. You have given us the gift of this day and Lord, we want to do your will. We don't always know what that is. Humble us oh God. I know that you know we are still just bumbling disciples. We still jockey for a position. We still look over our shoulder at others, but Lord, help us today not to do that. Help us rather to look for you and your call to love you, to feed your sheep, to take care of your people who we have power to help. Lord, I just thank you for each person here. Lord, especially be with those who remember our Falling Colleague. Lord, especially remember our three Georgians on this first day of Black History Month. Thank you for three soldiers who give their life for their country from Georgia. And Lord, we remember the great sacrifices that are being made and we know they do not go without your noticing and your honoring. We love you. We thank you in Jesus' name. Everybody said amen. And now let's pledge allegiance to the flag. And to the republic for which it stands, my nation, under God, and indivisible with liberty and justice for all. And that was good. The world of coding disease. Thank you so much. Doorkeepers, you may unlock the doors. Members, you can join Pastor Tom in the South Any Room and greet him and have a photo. Legislative Day 14, we have some important information that you need right now. Members, if I can get your attention. You ready, Mr. Clerk? Members, if you'll take your seats. The unfortunate loss of Chairman Smith brings us to a decision here. I would like you all to pay attention to. Mr. Clerk, will you read a resolution? House resolution 978, a resolution relative to meetings and adjournments of the General Assembly. You approved this resolution a few weeks ago, a couple weeks ago. But we need to have a discussion today. And I'm going to recognize the gentleman from the 104th, the majority leader, this House leader, ifstration, to speak to the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. House resolution 978 is an updated adjournment resolution for our legislative session. As we continue to keep Chairman Smith's family and our prayers right now and we are aware of the arrangements for Monday, which have been sent out. We have updated the proposed adjournment resolution. Which would have us out of session this upcoming Monday and we would then be in session on Friday, February 16th. Those are the only changes from the adjournment resolution that you previously passed. I'm going to speak if there are any questions I'd be happy to answer them. Mr. Leader, that's 16th. That was a day we were out, so we just backfill. Yes, sir, that's correct. If there are no questions, I will yield the well. Thank you. You do have a question. Yes, sir. I'm happy to yield. Representative Reese is recognizing a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This gentleman, you, yes, sir. Isn't it true that this entire body wants to have an opportunity to remember a giant in our community, especially Columbus, who gave so much to the state of Georgia? And isn't it true that we appreciate your leadership and changing the schedule so that we can all attend? I know that every member of this body recognizes the tremendous impact that Chairman Smith had on every Georgian and he's truly a legislative giant and it's appropriate and proper for the House and Senate to agree to modify the adjournment resolution. I thank the gentleman for the question. Mr. Speaker, if there's nothing further out, you'll the well, would ask members for their favorable consideration. Thank you. Thank you, Senator. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Senator, for the questions. Is there any objection to the adoption of the resolution? Chair, here's none. The resolution is adopted. Majority leader is recognized for a motion. For what purpose do you rise, Majority Leader? Mr. Speaker, to make a motion. State your motion. I move that the resolution just passed be immediately transmitted to the state Senate. Representative Estration moves the House resolution 978 be immediately transmitted to the Senate. Is there objection? Hearing none is ordered. Hey, Kate. Kate, what do you want us to do? You want us all stand up and look at you. Okay, y'all. Kate's in the gallery. She's going to give us a photo. So, members, if you'll move to your seats, that would be great. Thank you. Members on the back row, you need to move forward. Move forward. You know, cameras don't take pictures around corners or anything over balcony. So, if you want to be in the photo, you need to move forward. A little more. A little more. How about that, Kate, are we getting close now? If they haven't moved, don't worry about you. Take the shot. I think we're good. Thanks, Kate. What a great crowd, y'all are. Chairman Tarvan has recognized the chair of the Committee on Information and Audits. Chairman Tarvan. Mr. Speaker, your Committee on Information and Audits has read the journal from the previous legislative day and found it to be correct. And I would like to just, everybody, to think about this one, strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value. Be yourself. I think we just heard that message.

Okay here's the one I've been waiting for represent during Carter's recognize to talk about something represent a card let's hear it members this is important give your attention to the lady in the well. Well thank you first I'd like to acknowledge our heart health advocates that are up in the well you guys will stand in the gallery. Thank you thank you so thank you all for wearing red today and definitely feel free to join me if you like as I share this is the American Heart Association's hundredth year of advocacy and I have a resolution and that I read really fast. I recognize in February first as where red day and for other purposes whereas cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in women claiming more lives in all forms of cancer combined and yet only 44% of women recognize that cardiovascular disease is their greatest health threat. And whereas among females 20 years and older nearly 45% are living with some form of cardiovascular disease and less than half of women entering pregnancy in the United States have optimal cardiovascular health and whereas cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of maternal death in the United States or more simply put heart disease is the number one killer of new moms. And whereas overall 10 to 20% of women will have a health issue doing pregnancy and the presence of high blood pressure pre clamps you and gastro get gestational diabetes okay during pregnancy and greatly increases women's risk for developing cardiovascular disease later in life. Whereas cardiovascular disease cardio most cardiac and stroke events can be prevented through education and lifestyle changes such as moving more eating smart and managing blood pressure. Whereas in 2020 stroke cost of death of 90,627 females approximately 56.5% of the total stroke deaths whereas women are often less likely to receive bystanders CPR because rescuers fear asculation of inappropriate touching and sexual assault or potentially injuring the victim. And whereas they are significantly biological differences between men and women and clinical trials have not always adequately enrolled women are analyzed sex specific differences in the data as of 2020 only 38% of cardiovascular clinical research trial participants are women we got to do something about that. And whereas since 2004 the American Heart Association Go Red movement has addressed the awareness and clinical care gaps of women's greatest health threat. Cardiovascular disease and on the cups of the American Heart Association's 100th anniversary it continues to make bold moves to save lives and partners scientific discoveries. Now therefore be resolved that by the House of Representatives that the members of this body recognize February 1st, 2024 as wear red day and encourage all citizens to raise awareness about cardiovascular disease and well as show their support for women and the fight against heart disease by wearing red. So again thank you for wearing red. Yes thank you guys. This is speaker we yield the well and in 2 30 and 12 we'll have a heart healthy lunch where you also don't forget to come down and you have your pins on your desk too. I'll finish me yield the well now. You did a good job of getting members here in red there are a lot of red ties here and so you did a great job of that and thank you for what y'all do such an important important health concern for Georgians and fall Americans and thank you for being very proactive. We have y'all in the House and we appreciate the House supporting this is very important concern that we have for our health. We have another group in the gallery that needs recognizing I want to let's see we have the birthday boy from yesterday represent Lehman Franklin and chairman Parish for a morning order. Thank you for giving the gentleman the well your attention you recognize. Thank you Mr. Speaker I just want to take this opportunity but you not do to recognize a bullock leadership that's in the House right now the people's house if you guys could stand up. Yeah there you are over here on the on the left hand side welcome to the House and if you guys see them today please welcome them they're a great outstanding group of leaders in our community and we're thankful to have y'all here thank y'all. Always good to have home folks up here thank y'all for making the journey and we appreciate you we'll see you later. That concludes our morning orders we'll move on to the rules calendar calendar members. Mr. Clerk will you read the caption to hb905905 Mr. Clerk. House Bill 905 or is it a breeze of the 99th and Roberts the 52nd lever the hundred and 23rd and others be a title act to amend. Chapter 66 and title 36 of the fiscal to Georgia annotated relating zoning procedures is pertaining to counties and municipal corporations. So through repeal provisions authorizing administrative officers to exercise zoning powers. This bill ever referred to the committee on governmental affairs that committee recommends that this bill do pass.

Every bill is imported. We have some imported work to consider. Works been done on this bill. So let's give the gentleman your attention. If you have some, there's other important. Discussion is going on. So if you will, there's an any room. There's an any room. Take it out there. Representative Rees, you're recognized. I think you have their attention now. You're an attention getter. So get up here and tell us about HB905. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, House colleagues. If House Bill 905 looks familiar, if the contents of the bill look familiar, that's because you voted in favor of it last year as part of an omnibus local government bill with seven or eight topics. When it went over the Senate, the Senate passed three or two or three of them. And so this bill is brought back this year as a free standing bill that passed out of the governmental affairs committee. It relates somewhat to the petition for review statutes that Chairman Lebritt shepherded through a few years ago, as well as the zoning procedures law statute that are amendment that Representative Roberts shepherded through in 2022. What this bill does in our state, which is number one place to business, there are a lot of permits that are needed in construction. From the 1970s until the 2022 law permits were normally handled by an employee in the zoning office, a staff member, as opposed to the elected officials. There was some language in the 2022 bill that has led local governments to believe that they are required to send permits that normally had been handled administratively through the zoning process. This bill would make it a choice of the local governments whether to send permits through the full zoning process, but it clarifies that an administrative permit can still be handled at the administrative level and does not have to go through the zoning process. I yield for questions, Mr. Speaker. Obviously, they remember from last year their representatives, you have no questions. Thank you. I yield the well. The gentleman has yielded the well. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there an objection to agreeing to report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes? All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? I have all members voted for what purposes represent you, Jason Ridley-Rise? Paul Mentor inquired. State you anyone? Mr. Speaker, would the passage of this bill, would this help? For what purposes represent you, Jason Ridley-Rise? Paul Mentor inquired. State you anyone? Mr. Speaker, would the passage of this bill, would this help Biden's bill back better get going? Because we've been waiting three years and hadn't seen nothing happen yet? Is that not true? I'm sure the gentleman has his opinion about a lot of things, including that one. Not sure at all, holds water, but it's your opinion. You entitled to that. All members voted if so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of the bill, House Bill 905, the Yezor 167, the Nasor 0, this bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, would you read the caption to House Bill 985, 985? House Bill 985, members of the Martin of the 49th and Campbell of the 15th, be entitled an act to amend Article 7, Chapter 3, Title 20. The official code of Georgia and Entity relating to scholarships, loans and grants, so as to abolish the Georgia higher education assistance corporation. This bill I've referred to the Committee on Higher Education, that committee recommends a disbilled due pass. Chairman Martin is recognized to present the bill, House Bill 95. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, the House, you will recognize this one as well. This was House Bill 319 last year. We passed unanimously, I believe, out of the House. It picked up some baggage in the Senate, which caused the governor to have to veto it. This sunset's a corporation within the board of the student finance, the higher education assistance corporation, let me tell you what it doesn't do. It doesn't affect anybody getting alone. It doesn't affect anybody repaying alone. It doesn't affect any operations. The loan portfolio was sold in 2013, that was paid out in the business, all the business closed in 2023. This corporation does no business, and by sunsetting it, it will, they don't have to do a blank audit every year. It will save the state money, and in fact, they can return over $25 million to the state for use for educational purposes. Again, we passed this as House Bill 319 last year, unanimously, with that, I would ask the House's favorable consideration, I've been brief. If there is a question, I'll try to answer it. Not trying to hide anything, just trying to move as long as Thursday. Gentlemen, has no questions. I yield the wellness week. Gentlemen, as yield to the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered that Chair, here's none, the previous question is ordered? Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none, the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass, all in favor of the passage of the bill, will vote yes, all those opposed will vote no, and Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? Clerk will. All members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of House Bill 985, the yeas are 166, and the yeas are zero. This bill, having you received, the requisite Constitutional majority is therefore passed. Members, we have a couple of motions. What purpose does Chairman Martin rise? You have a motion to move the bill? I'm sorry. Oh, yeah. Yes, sir. I would like to move House Resolution 804 from the committee to judiciary to government affairs. The both Chairman have agreed. And maybe a wise move on your part. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? House Resolution 804 by motion of Martin, the 49th and others proposing an amendment to the Constitution so it's to change the date by which temporary loans for county municipalities and other political subdivisions of the state are palpable and full. On the general's motion that House Resolution 804 be withdrawn from the judiciary committee and read committed to the government affairs committee is the objection. Hearing none is ordered. For what purpose does Chairman Sains rise? To make a motion that a bill be moved from one. Stayed that motion. To make a motion that a bill be moved from from ways and means to small business, both Chairman are in agreement. House Bill 1020. House Bill 1020. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? House Bill 1020 by motion of Sains of the 180th and others to be entitled to amend Code Section 48740.1 of the fiscal to Georgia annotated relating tax credits for business enterprises and less developed areas. On the general's motion that HB 1020 be withdrawn from the ways and means committee and read committed to the small business development committee is their objection. Hearing none, it is so ordered. Clerk will read the caption to a group of privileged resolutions. Honoring the life and memory of Richard Smith. Honoring the life and memory of Sergeant Brianna, Alexandria Muffin. Honoring the life and memory of Dexter Scott King.

Here's their objection to adopting the privilege resolutions. Chair, here's none, and the resolutions are adopted. We're going to move on to afternoon orders, but before I do that, I'm going to recognize a veteran of this body, and I want you all to listen up as this gentleman comes to the will for a point of personal privilege. Members, if you'll give representative Al Williams or undivided attention, he and I would be most appreciative. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Sometimes reluctantly arise, because sometimes things are taken offensively that are not intended to be offensive. I love this house, and I love the traditions of this house, and the protocol of this house. And one in particular, there are a couple of that it was at the discretion only of the speaker, like most, this, well, doing a session, is at the discretion of the speaker to recognize who's in the well, and when you want to accompany someone in the well, usually it's because you've been invited to do so by the person who is speaking, and of course the speaker had discretion, if he does not know, to say only the person is recognized, but when you get here, you never ever stand to the front of the person who has the well. It is a break of protocol, if you stand forward, because if you in the military, you never stand forward of the commander when he's talking. From this point over, is done, from there, is back. Never here, never up here, never up here. And I know we want to get up here and be just near to the front, but because, but if you weren't the first person up here, you can't be on the front row. You literally have to go until it runs out, and we run out of space, that means you don't really don't need to be up here. I mean, I'm just calling like it is. Never to the front of the speaker, never, this way back. And one thing I'd like, but if he was gonna say this to the speaker, it's in front only, I spent many, many years enjoying your tradition, there was strictly a discretion of the speaker, there's no rule on this. And that was when the speaker, when the majority leader moves for the deronement that day, and the speaker approves it and carries the motion, runs down from there, runs to the front of the podium, bows to the representatives, and then runs out the door. Now, that required a little running ability, but that was a beautiful thing for over 100 years in his house, but that was strictly a discretion of the speaker, as Charles and not to run, and sometimes when I talk to him, I know why. Some things, and this is only said in love, because all I know, I learn from people who knew, and then my opinion doesn't mean anything if they knew and gave me good advice. Many people are not told about the protocol of this well. So as you're told, as you learn, you do better. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, thank you for this moment. You're the well. Thank you, Representative Williams, and you're right. That protocol is in our rules, but more importantly is in our tradition, and the reason it's in our tradition is its respect. And I'm gonna ask all the members to show that respect, and I'll do a better job as well. So thank you, Representative Williams. Members, you have about two and a half minutes. I'm gonna turn the light on you at two minutes, and so we're gonna move through, because we have several of you today, but I wanna give the first representative, Representative Crawford, the lead off, and I'll give him, Representative Crawford. All right. Members, if you'll join, would Representative Crawford give him your attention, if you'll stand. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and to my family, and friends in the gallery, it's been a very tough week for all of us, and the scripture says that, blessed are those who mourn for they will be comforted. And as I stand here today, I pray for everyone's comfort throughout this week. And it's with the heavy heart that I tell you that my friend and mentor in high school, Tracking Field Coach at the Cab County in state legend, died last night. My coach, Napoleon Cobb, as you see on that screen, was one of the greatest men and ever coaches to ever live. And I hold that coach's, that title of coach, is one of the most prestigious titles, because day in and day out, you have to motivate people to do their best, and to continue to reach certain peaks that they never thought that they could. He was masterful at that. The picture that you see is of Coach Cobb in the Senate Chamber, taken a year's ago, after he was inducted into the Georgia High School, Tracking Field Hall of Fame. And he deserved that honor. His coaching resume included, but wasn't limited to 11 state titles, a national state title. He coached multiple individual state champions, and I was blessed to be in that number, in multiple Olympic champions, collectively, these champions won approximately 10 medals. I'm gonna ask for your indulgence, and tell you a funny story before I take my seat. When I wanted to run for office, I wanted to get his support and advice. Who better to tell you how to run a political race in a Tracking Field Coach? And so I said to him, coach, I wanna be a state rep, and he said, is that the place where they honored me? I said, well, coach, I'll be in the House Chamber, not the Senate Chamber. And he says, okay, I was reeling him in. He said, will you be an attorney and a politician? I thought I lost him. I know that that's not the best combination all the time, but he says, if you win, just make sure that you mentor all of the kids in the camp county, because they need to see someone that looks like them that's doing the work, working as a politician, as an attorney. And the last thing that he said to me, and I wanna share this with you, something that I live by, he says to me, yo, Mari, I don't care who runs against you. If I've taught you nothing else, it is to focus on your race. We don't worry about who's gonna get into a political race. When you look into another person's lane, you slow down. And so, coach, thank you very much. I'm gonna live by that coach. You had a hell of a run, but I got it from here. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I ask for a moment of silence for my coaches honor. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I yield the well. Thank you, Riersten De Crawford. I'm sure that he saw your success. He pointed out what a great example you are. I appreciate your example and appreciate that special bond we have with our coaches. Thank you. Representative Roberts. Everything she Roberts is recognized for an order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. I want to wish you all a very happy St. Bridget's Day. Ireland recently established February 1st as a new public holiday celebrating St. Bridget and the creativity and achievements of women trying to give a little balance to the celebration of St. Patrick's Day. So this year, consulates and embassies around the world are hosting events to mark the day. Last night, I was honored to participate in Atlanta's celebration with Quive, our Consul General and Senator Karpatric. We talked about women in politics. They had a Grammy-nominated soloist perform May. It was really nice evening. So for those of you who don't know, Bridget was a pagan goddess. And then her namesake later became the patron saint of Bridget. She has a strong presence in my family as my great-grandmother, great-ant, mother, and daughter. I'll share her namesake. She was a woman who stood for helping others, empowering women, caring for the environment. And legend has it, St. Bridget turned dirty water into beer and managed to share a single pot of ale with her entire parish of 18 churches. So I hope you will all raise a pint to St. Bridget today. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You learned some really cool things in this house. Never knew about St. Bridget. Thank you, Representative. Representative Holly and Representative Franklin are recognized for in that new order. Oh, Representative Paris, Chairman Paris, Representative Holly. And, oh, all three, y'all. Three must-cateriors here, I'm interested to see this one. If per the careful instruction we have, gentlemen, are you taking your places? Okay. Today we wish a happy, heavenly birthday. Tribute to Bullock County's own, Dr. Laila Alice Dottrey Denmark, who was known as America's oldest practicing physician in pediatrics. A graduate of Tiff College and the Medical College of Georgia, she became the third woman to graduate from the Medical College of Georgia with a doctorate in 1928. Lila went on to be the first intern at Eglistan Hospital for Children in Atlanta and admitted the very first patient at Eglistan. She worked the segregated wards at Grady Hospital, tinged into poor African-American patients and later worked at Eglistan Hospital before starting her very own private practice. Her published research helped develop the vaccine for the whipping cloth. Dr. Denmark ran a medical office out of a farmhouse, charging, get this, just $10 for the very first visit and $8 for every visit thereafter for over 70 years. Several editions of Dr. Denmark said it, offered her timeless wisdom, her secret to living to become 114 years old. She believed that consuming cow's milk was harmful. She recommended children and adults drink only water and eat fresh fruit rather than drinking fruit juices. So if you are able-bodied, healthy, please join us in wishing a happy, heavenly birthday to this great Georgian with a hearty hand clap of praise. Applause. Thank you. Thank you for that. Representing you? That was what a great legacy, Dr. Denmark, from down in Bullock County. It's a good day for leadership. Bullock to be here. Bullock County being recognized. Good stuff. Representing kids, excuse me. Members before we exit the chain, some of you may get out. We're going to inject an announcement here. Chairman of appropriations that we heard about earlier in the message. So you were successful there. Chairman Matt Hetchet is recognized to let us give some vital information. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And I will not be near as eloquent as the previous two afternoon orders or as the pastor of the day, who I actually have known since he was born. So that's why he had to get me. Since we will not be back formally together until Tuesday morning, the appropriations committee will begin meeting at 7 a.m. Tuesday morning to begin going over the A.F. Y 24 budget. We will vote later around 9.930 on that. And then the budget will be in rules. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I wanted to make sure no one got out before we heard that announcement. Representative Ken Vance is recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I want to say a few things about Black History Month, which starts today. This movement began in Chicago in 1915 with Mr. Carter G. Woodson. February was chosen as the time to begin this celebration, because it was the month wherein Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass were born on the 12th and 14th respectively. Fast forward to 1975 when President Gerald Ford became the first president to urge Americans to recognize Black History Week. This week was expanded to the entire month of February in 1976 and was established by federal legislation 10 years later. I'd like to close with four things that once I heard them have left an indelible mark upon me. First, and we all know this one, I have a dream that one day. You know the rest of it. Number two from Malcolm X. If you have no critics, you'll likely have no success. Number three, can't we all just get along? Rodney Key. And last but certainly not least, from Augusta George's own James Brown. I got so, and I'm super bad. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Applause. Mr. Leader is going out to get better to get better than that. I'm going to tell you what. Thank you, Representative Hagen. Representative Hagen is recognized. Thank you so much, Mr. Speaker, for letting me follow that. Colleagues, today we've been celebrating a cause that is near and dear to our hearts. Heart, health. I know some of our colleagues seem like they don't have a heart, but there is one in there somewhere down deep. And we want to take care of those, no matter how near to the surface or hidden those hearts may be. As Rip Carter pointed out earlier today, heart disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide. It's a silent adversary that often goes unnoticed until it's far too late. But today we've had the opportunity to raise awareness and remind Georgians to prioritize their heart, health. And we're all in a unique position in here serving under the gold dome to send a powerful message that we stand united on certain things. And today we've been able to do that. So if you were read today and you would like to, I'd like to invite you to join us upon adjournment on the steps just out here for a group photo of everybody wearing red. Kate, it will be taking that photo. And I hope that we can do that together so that we have something to show our solidarity on this important issue. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is the South steps? Yes, ma'am. You all heard the order.

Representative Carolyn Hugley and Representative Inga Willis recognize for an afternoon order. I'm sure you have. She's on the way. She's on the way yet. Thank you, Representative Hugley. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House. I know that you all will be in Columbus with us on Monday. But for those of you who are still in and around the Capitol, Monday is Link's Dad the Capitol. And as we focus on African American history, the Link's is one of the oldest volunteer organizations that are dedicated to ensuring the culture and economic survival of African American. And these women come from all over the state of Georgia and they're from your community as well. There is a reception on Sunday, February 4th, at the Noles Conference Center at Georgia State University College of Law, from 5 until 8 p.m. So if you're in town, stop by Sunday afternoon between 5 and 8. If you are here at the Capitol, they will be in the Sloppy Floyd building from 8 a.m. until 1 p.m. So it's Link's Dad the Capitol. All of your constituents will be here from all over Georgia. And if you would, if you know some of the members that are coming, leave them a note. We already told them about the unfortunate passing of representative Smith so they know where most of us will be. So thank you so much and we hope those of you who can please join us. Thank you, representatives. Representing more is recognized for an afternoon order representing more. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I said I wasn't going to say anything, but I've had meetings in my office with at least six of seniors from my district that have come to talk to me about a very serious issue that I wasn't even aware of. The Georgia Department of Community Health established a program called Medicaid a state recovery program. These are programs where you can have medical services in your home, but upon your death, they take your home. And I felt that I was very upset to hear this because it puts their family, especially their husband or children out of their home. But what bothers me the most at this particular moment is that if they don't sign this paper that has gone out in January to sign over the D to their homes, their medical insurance quits, which means they have none. And so I want to bring the attention to Miss Christie, one of the constituents in my district. She is a paraplegic. If she does not have services, she won't be able to get out of the bed. No one will take her feeding or urine tube out of her body and clean it on a daily basis. And she will have no insurance. And she surely will die. And they surely, the state of Georgia will surely take her house. And I think that it is a great time today to say this out of my own mouth. It's a great day to expand Medicaid. Thank you. Thank you, Representative. Chair Lady Lynn Smith is recognized for an afternoon order. Chair Lady Smith. Thank you, Miss Speaker and members of the House. So I'm so grateful that the American Heart Association has trained us to recognize February as heart awareness month. I wish to talk something briefly that is not common knowledge. It goes to the importance of awareness. For several years, my husband, a vet, Vietnam vet came home. He talked chemical warfare before he went to Vietnam. He was exposed to Agent Orange. For several years, we never knew what was wrong. He'd have something we called fake heart attacks because he'd go to the hospital and send them home. But through the years, we were told you got to get there while it's going on. Yeah, right. How do you do that? But finally, he was diagnosed. Then we began a series of all these different tests with his diagnosed with heart disease. But, and this is where I think we all need to be aware, men, women, children to know this. He died from a brain bleed. A brain bleed. His dog was, he was walking the dog, the dog chased something, pulled him, fell. He just said we thought nothing was wrong. And for two days, he had a wonderful life. But he had what's called a Blacens. And they had to do that. One of the ways you were trying to keep him going. And we just weren't aware that when you're put on such heavy, heavy blood thinners, you are a victim to that. That goes to anyone in this room who has a friend or a family, especially if you're older. So keep an eye out for unusual symptoms. Know that this is a consequence. It's not talked about much, but actually it's a huge factor to a lot of deaths related to heart. And thank you, Mrs. Speaker, members of the House, for listening to me. And to all of you who came to this funeral, many, many things. Special message from a special lady. Thank you, Deputy Chair Lady. That completes our afternoon orders. Now we have some announcements. Before any more of you exit the chamber, I'll make one announcement. Look at your inboxes. We have a message you just want out to every member of this house. There will be some transportation opportunity provided by this house to attend the funeral in Columbus on Monday. So the details should be in your inbox. If for some reason you don't receive it, it's not transmitted properly. You can call my office. We'll help you with that or you can call the majority office as well and talk to Peyton. Either one. So with chicken boxes, I thank you all out. You can see the message. And if you would like to take advantage of the travel arrangements, that's what it's there for. Representative McClain, you ready for an announcement? Yes, I am. Let's hear it. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. There I did put there two things on your desk for me today. One is something to reference to SB333. So please get a chance to read that from the Gwyneth County commissioners. Today is just like everything else. Georgia Work and Family Colleges legislative caucus day. And we've changed our location and will be in room 132 in the capital downstairs for lunch. So please stop in. We have lunch all over the place today. So please stop in working family caucus. Be the overview of Georgia 2025 budget. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representative.

Could you please stand up here with me, but behind me, sir, and Representative Carl Gillier. I appreciate you. I'm going to stay on email. That's right. It's fine. Listen, today is a very special day. A many of you guys don't realize this, but there was a former member of this house who's a dear friend of mine Craig Gordon. I think this is a movie producer believe it or not. This weekend his movie comes out in Atlanta, L.A. in New York, and it's called the Geechi Witch. Geechi Witch. It is the first time that an African American, a Geechi and these two brothers are Geechi. Y'all asking what it means later. It's the first time that a horror movie was produced by a Geechi person right out of South Georgia. I'm glad you got that one in. I think the leader made it clear that Craig is from Savannah. So that's awesome. I'm with you, Mr. Leader. I'm not much on horror movies either, but I'll see that one. Let you tell me I'm scared it is. I'm excited if I'm going to see it or not.

If you're on the transportation committee, you're getting texts from me from a group text that he's helping me with. That's so that is me. It's been a little bit of challenge this morning for me, but we do have a meeting at 1 o'clock today. We have a couple of bills so we need to get out and get into the flow of things. I appreciate your attention. Thank you. Where is that meeting going to occur? Hey, I use my trusty app, the Senate to them. They don't need you to make an announcement.
