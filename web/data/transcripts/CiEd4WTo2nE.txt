Jeremy Smith
thank you speaker
you know it's always scary when your
pastor comes and you see this line of
people lining up to talk to him you
don't know what they're going to say but
you got a pretty good idea
um
Dr Jimmy Elder has been the pastor of
First Baptist Church in Columbus for
20 years this August I think
um
they sent him down there because they
knew there was somebody down there that
needed a lot of help
amen I understand
um
I always call them Dr Elder Jimmy
because we have a fantastic relationship
and that it has grown over those 20
years
um
there have been some really good times
for like the Mercer School of Medicine
that we were deeply involved in and he
was as integral in that process as
anybody
there's been some sad times he did to
provide the services for my grandson
when he was buried
uh but he also did the dedication of
my great-granddaughter and he also did
um
you know several well he did a
dedication when my granddaughter got
married
so we've had some wonderful experiences
together
so he's uh
not only is he my pastor
he's my friend and he's one of those
individuals that I hope each one of you
get the opportunity to have in your life
a mentor
uh I've got him by a few a few years but
that's okay
um he uh is a tremendous mentor and I
really uh look and
really need his advice Jim is a graduate
of Mercer he also is a graduate of the
Southern Baptist Theological Seminary
and Princeton Theological Seminary
um but he
he's just a great individual and I love
him and all my family love him Jimmy
Elder

oh I'm so honored to be here
speaker Burns
chairman Smith
members of the Georgia House of
Representatives staff and friends in the
gallery
I'm honored to be a part of beginning
your day today
it's a great day the Lord has created it
and given it to us
so we will rejoice and be glad in what
the Lord does here
our community of Columbus Georgia is
grateful for all that you do
we feel the impact of the decisions that
you make and I'm grateful for our
delegation we have a wonderful
delegation here
and I'm particularly grateful for
chairman Richard Smith
Richard and I have been friends for a
long long time and I'll tell you
something
I know him when he's not in the gallery
and when he's not in the office or at
the Chairman's desk
I know him as an individual whom I
respect and love and appreciate he's as
good a man
off the Record as he is on the record
and I love him dearly thank you my
friend
almost 20 years ago I made a deep and
abiding commitment to be a better
Steward of my body
and the life that God has given to me
and to that end I started going to the
YMCA every morning at 5 20.
yeah
I'd work out dress and leave about 7 20.
this was an important time of exercise
and reflection of fellowship and
accomplishment for me
well Monday was a week ago I arrived at
5 20. I put on my bike shoes and I
participated in an RPM class that's a
spinning class most of you probably know
that's a class where you actually sit on
a stationary bike
with the most enthusiastic and demanding
instructor who has a voice that carries
all the way to Atlanta I can promise you
very strongly coaching
maybe interpreted as yelling at us and
telling us to pedal and stand and sit
and sweat for 45 minutes
when we ride the equivalent of about 10
to 12 miles
it can be brutal
but it's one of those things that you do
because it feels so good when you stop
doing it
I always walk out of spin class with a
little bit of a Swagger you know some
sweat on my brow
and I kind of walk past all the other
people that did not brave spin class
that morning and give them that nod like
you know I just did this
and so I returned to the locker room I
shower I dress for the day what a day to
what a way to begin a day
a little self-pried not a lot of
self-pride kind of creeps into that
moment
on this past Monday though my Apple
watch which tracks my athletic
activities bust
I looked at the health app and it read
congratulations you've accomplished all
your goals for today
it was 6 15 in the morning
I'd accomplished everything that I had
said as a goal for exercise for the
whole day
now the fact is it's based on an
algorithm that Apple does I don't
understand it all but it takes your
daily activities it averages it figures
out what your goals must be and so I
stopped in the middle of the locker room
and looked at my watch again just to
make sure it was right
at first I kind of felt proud I had
accomplished that
then I felt mortified
I was ashamed that my daily goal was
something that could be accomplished so
quickly so early in the day
my goal wasn't set high enough evidently
and I felt a little bit lost you know
like Alexander the Great there were no
other worlds to conquer at least for
that day
I remember the words of my dad a
minister
who helped me write a prayer that I had
to deliver at the morning devotion at
Rockdale County High School when I was
growing up
and what Dad said is I said dad what do
I put in that prayer he said
one thing to say is Lord please help me
to set my goals high enough to be a
challenge
but low enough to be reached
now I understand not not setting
impossible goals but I do need to know
that my goals are high enough that I'll
be stretched to the Limit and actually
make bold efforts to do something that
truly matters something that is
sacrificial something that reaches
beyond the boundaries of expectation
that tests the limits of my ability no
pain no gain
I've always been one of those who
believe that you should dream in
possible dreams and work with all of
your might to accomplish them
I remember the words of John Kennedy and
it addressed to the crowd at Rice
University we choose to go to the moon
in this decade and do other things not
because they're easy but because they're
hard
his campaign song was high hopes
yet today we live in a world that tempts
us to play it safe compromise our dreams
even our values and not take chances
we're drawn towards safe things while
nothing has ever been accomplished by
playing it safe
it takes bold dreams to represent people
an uncompromising Spirit to take on
challenges of the day the ability to
dream The Impossible and to work to make
the impossible possible
and a steadfast faith in the Limitless
opportunities that lie before us
that's what it takes
we have people in our wonderful State
who've gone beyond what anyone ever
thought any human being could do
they've invented they've developed
they've LED strengthened built achieved
created and accomplished more than
anyone would had they played it safe
we knew we were not finished for the day
by 6 15 in the morning
what we have done is only a Prelude to
what we will do next
in a world that gives trophies to
everyone and is loath to acknowledge
Superior accomplishment we have the
opportunity to be a chamber that sets
the example for Big Dreams amazing
accomplishments humble service and an
inspiring others to do their very best
and you do you are examples for people
young people in this state
you are the people who lead the way in
Innovation and hope never set your goal
so low that you finish too early in the
day
as individuals who represent the people
of Georgia we are depending upon you I
as a citizen am depending upon you to be
bold and never allow the pressures fears
hesitation to hamper your mission to
take our state to where it's never gone
before in quality of life for all
citizens and prosperity for everyone
God blesses the Bold Spirit of one who
trusts in him and uses gifts and
opportunities he's given them he wants
you and me to do the right needful and
important things not because they're
easy but because they're hard
Jeremiah 32 17 says Ah Lord God it is
you who have made the heavens and the
Earth by your great power and by your
outstretched arm nothing is too hard for
you
knowing that we should never set our
sights too low
if you have something you really believe
in
something that needs to be done for the
good of the people something that has
strong moral and ethical base go for it
boldly make sure it's part of your
commitment
the Apostle Paul said forgetting the
things that are behind and reaching
forth to the things that are before I
press on toward the mark of the prize of
the call of God in Christ Jesus
you have a high calling
match it with high expectations Robert
Frost said Freedom lies in being bold
as for me I'm resetting this Apple watch
and I pray that you'll find the next
bold hard important thing that you're
called to do for the people of Georgia
I am cheering you on toward greatness
and unbelievable accomplishment
I believe in you
I appreciate you
I genuinely love you and what you do
may God bless you
amen will you pray with me
spirit of God As We Gather in this place
you are the God of all of us
you Embrace us with your grace and your
love
you give to us the ability to share our
breath one with another because it all
comes from you
may we see each other through eyes of
equality through hearts of love
and have a bold Spirit to do the right
thing always uncompromising
because we answer ultimately to you
thank you for each one who serves in
your name we pray amen
to the flag of the United States of
America and to the Republic for which it
stands one nation under God indivisible
with liberty and justice for all

members we were ready to move on to the
rules calendar
Mr clerk will you read the caption to HB
311 311
household 311 of Representative Smith
the 70th and others be titled back to
amend article one of chapter five of
title 48 of the official go to Georgia
annotated relating to General Provisions
regarding ad valorem taxation of
property so to provide for optional
temporary tax relief to certain
properties located nationally declared
Federal disaster areas it's bill ever
referred the committee on ways and means
that committee recommends that this bill
do pass
chair lady Lynn Smith is recognized to
present the bill sure lady
thank you Mr Speaker and members of the
House well it's March we're getting
close to some difficult times in our
state in the United States with bad
weather and it happened to my County
about three years ago when a class four
tornado came through my County
just for a minute
this is an important bill
thank you Mr lady deserves to be heard
so take your conversations elsewhere
continue please thank you Mr Speaker
this is in reference to Federal declared
natural disaster areas and it applies to
that to damaged or destroyed homes
during the year of the natural disaster
this assembly to those who are new
debate of this issue and we unanimously
voted to support house resolution
594 last year that will give our local
government several options in which to
apply some type of ad valorem property
tax relief
this came about from a lament to me by a
local official it was several months
after the tornado wiped out a large part
of my County
and he said to me you know what's going
on now and I said no he said well
our people are still recovering from
what happened to their homes and now
they're going to get hit with their
property tax bill
and most of them do not have a home or
it's very destroyed and they can't use
it so this bill to make this become
reality for us which is what we're
debating today this Bill had to be put
to the people as a constitutional
amendment it was about amendment number
two last year it got 92 percent of the
vote
what it will do if we pass House Bill
311 and we have to pass House Bill 311
to make this possible for our citizens
and by the way it got 92 percent of the
vote I think it was the most heavily
supported initiative in last year's
general election but what this bill will
do now is that our our local governments
and this is this the cities counties
school boards they will get to determine
themselves what type of relief they can
give to our citizens who are dealing
with this continuing tragedy
you are so supportive of it last year we
and um I want to give a shout out to the
Ways and Means Committee I appeal to
their Collective wisdom and they came up
with something that worked but actually
I'm the author of this bill and there
are several great sponsors on the bill
but the voice in this bill is directed
to the very ones who will make this
determination which are all our local
governments and you will have you should
look and see the flyer on your desk it
explains to you
who had input into this bill and it's
all our local governments remember again
it's optional and so for us right now we
have the option will we vote unanimously
once more to support this wonderful
initiative that we as a body have
crafted for the citizens of Georgia
Thank you Mr Speaker

and others to be titled not to amend
chapter 7 of title 40 80 officials go to
Georgia annotated related to income
taxes so as to revise the tax credit for
certain medical preceptor rotations this
bill I've referred to the committee on
ways it means that committee recommends
that this bill do pass
representative Dr chairman Newton is
recognized to present the Bill thank you
Mr Speaker bring to your colleague's
house bill 308. this is extends a
current program that's been very
successful in helping train uh students
at georgia-based schools in particular
in health care areas that are so needed
across Georgia it includes nurse
practitioners Pas and medical students
it offers them a real world access to
where they can see the difference
between what's done in a tertiary care
hospital but can actually work on the
ground in the operating rooms and on the
medical floors with doctors and nurses
Nurse Practitioners and PAs across
Georgia that does this by offering a tax
credit to preceptor Physicians nurse
practitioners and PAs who are fully
trained and board certified it allows
them to uh to offer these uh rotations
month-long rotations it does give them a
tax credit of either 750 or a thousand
dollars a month up to 10 a year it does
preclude you from getting paid as a as a
preceptor for any other other locations
it's limited as I said to 10 a year
because we want this to be a high
quality experience for our students it's
proven to be very successful this bill
will add Dentistry to that that will
allow dentists to for dental students
who want to go see real world practice
as part of their educational experience
it would open this tax credit program to
dentists we've been expanding training
for nurse practitioners for Pas and in
particular for medical students with
medical campuses obviously at a MCG
campuses for Mercer and Macon Savannah
and now Columbus Moultrie has pcom
Atlanta with Emory and others Morehouse
School of Medicine all of them are
trying to add to their students to try
to keep Georgia from staying at 40th in
the nation when it comes to doctors per
capita so this has been a great program
it's it's been a proven program this
would extend it but beyond its current
end date of 2023 December to uh 2028 so
it will allow our schools to continue
doing the great training they're doing I
hope you'll feel free to support it glad

chairman choke us to present the bill
thank you Mr Speaker ladies and
gentlemen of the house I bring before
you house bill 505.
Georgians proudly defend the rights of
peaceful protesters but will not
tolerate violence that damages people or
property
liberal cities that have created
autonomous zones for law Breakers have
created trouble unsafe and unsanitary
conditions for residences and businesses
we will not let that happen here
our governor and our attorney general
have made it clear that Georgia will
provide no Safe Haven to rioters
this legislation puts that Vision into
state law and sends a signal to
troublemakers throughout the country
that they won't get a slap on the wrist
if they come here and engage in rioting
we will prosecute the violent in order
to protect the peaceful and innocent
the violence we saw recently that grew
out of the violent riots against the
Atlanta Public Safety Training Center
was broadcast far beyond our state lines
with our downtown dependent upon
convention and tourism dollars we must
protect that industry from the brand
damage that would result from further
riots
the only thing that this bill does
is it increases the penalty for criminal
offense of riot
from a misdemeanor to a felony
let me repeat that
from a misdemeanor to a felony
the second thing that it does
is it adds Riot to the list of offenses
that must have Baal decided by a
superior court judge
as chairman of the Small Business
Development Committee
I feel that is my responsibility to put
support the thousands of small
businesses across the state
from restaurants Beauty parlors clothing
stores
to convenience stores jewelry stores
tattoo shops
these violent Acts
of riots provide a dangerous environment
for the businesses to operate it is not
only detrimental to the business owners
but more importantly to their employees
their staff
and their patrons
small businesses are the largest
employers in the state
they provide more jobs than any other
entity
these small businesses provide the
manpower to coach little league
raise money for local school programs
support the Boy and Girl Scouts and help
with local disasters
in so many cases small businesses are
family endeavors I know from personal
experience that my children helped me
it is unfair for small businesses to
face the additional threat of riot
especially now after so many were closed
during the covid-19 crisis
HB 505 will help small business
thank you Mr Speaker I yield for about
two or three questions
gentlemen will yield for our question to
your left
representative Kelly from the 16th has a
question
thank you Mr Speaker with the gentleman
yield yes sir I'll yield now chairman
chokos isn't it true that what we're
trying to focus in this bill are on
these violent rights and we've had some
discussion uh debate that
this could be applied just as simply as
if two individuals got in a fight we've
heard that in the debate isn't that true
yes sir but isn't true that's not what
we're focused on here that's true it's
on violence and so isn't it further true
Mr chairman that
under current law that they a simple
fight between between two individuals
couldn't be charged under this right
statute according to the rule of
leniency and the misdemeanor offense of
a Fray isn't that true yes sir all right
thank you Mr chairman
thank you thank you for that question
gentlemen yield yes sir I do
representative hugely to your left again
has a question yes ma'am thank you Mr
Speaker does the gentleman yield yes
ma'am can you explain to us what in your
mind is the definition of a ride and how
a police officer would not act that on
like they tack on every other charge
when they arrest people
um
well
it has to be two or more people that are
involved in a in a violent Act
and according to case law
Riot requires common intent and a
concert action of intent so in other
words the the example that was used in
the rules committee whereas you have a
ballroom brawl you have two people
opposing to each other that would not be
valid at this time it's totally
irrelevant it's where two or more people
have a common intent
to create a to create violence and so
that's that would be the definition that
we're working from and it's already in
case law
thank you gentlemen yield for another
question
sir this will be the last one
representative
let's see the uh
Majority Leader illustration has a
question I guess I best recognize them I
think so
famous speakers the gentleman yield yes
sir sir isn't it true as you just
pointed out the definition of Riot is
already in law and that is unchanged as
part of your bills that is absolutely
correct and isn't it also true that as
uh to the question that was raised in
the rules committee if there were to be
a fight that occurs between between
individuals that meets the definition of
a misdemeanor a Fray that actually by
law the prosecutor must charge the
misdemeanor offense
if there are not additional elements
that would otherwise require a
heightened charge isn't that true that
is also true sir thank you enough for
thank you thank you for that question as
I said earlier it requires a common
intent uh and a concerted action to
create violence and with that Mr Speaker
I asked for the body's favorable
consideration and I yield a well thank
you sir
the gentleman has yielded the well we're
going to move on to additional speakers
we have um several people who'll speak
I'm going to recognize representative
Crawford
for the um
okay we'll change that order then
represent the audensonia will be
recognized to speak to the bill now you
have a total of 30 minutes
and that can be uh split up any way you
desire as you speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
members of the House of Representatives
I rise in opposition to house bill 505.
I know sometimes some of us may feel
pressured
to vote along with party members
but I want you all to stay with me for
just a couple minutes
on March 7 1965.
John Lewis and hundreds of protesters
gathered on the Edmond bridge in Selma
Alabama
to exercise their first amendment
the right
of the people
to peacefully Assemble
and to express their grievances to the
government
in this instance
the policeman attacked this peaceful
protesters
injured many of them
who locked arms together
and fought for the freedom
in our highest
American values
of their sacrifice paved way for so many
of us to sit in this chamber
especially those of you that look like
me and to all of the women
irrespective of your party
it is evident that the policeman incited
a riot
in this day in our history is known as
the Bloody Sunday
in 1848
Elizabeth Stanton
along with over 300 women
gathered in Seneca Falls New York
to peacefully exercise their First
Amendment right
these women wanted to be treated as
individuals
and not dependence of men
they wanted more employment
opportunities they wanted educational
opportunities
they wanted freedom to run for office
and to speak in front of Congress
and to vote
through the effort
we see all of you amazing women sitting
here today
making a difference and making Georgia
better
now while the legislators behind this
bill
may suggest this language only targets
protesters engaging crimes of violence
this bill expressly contemplates
non-criminal conduct or just take a look
at lines 11 and 12 of the bill
it defined Riot as
two or more individuals engaged
in either one
unlawful act of violence or two
any other act committed in a violent and
tumultuous manner
think about that for a second
this language leaves a gray area
any other act committed
an act of violence and tumultuous manner
this implies that there are some types
of non-criminal conduct
that may rise to the level of
Iran when performed by two or more
people
and then this bill is asking you all to
vote yay
to make it a felony
to protest
and then be punishable up to 20 years
20.
to break it down in simpler terms
what this bill is asking for is that
do not dare
to assemble and exercise your
First Amendment
we have seen many times where
law enforcement consciously arouses
peaceful protesters
and then be the one to spark the riot
and we are asking this protesters
to be punishable up to 20 years
a while it may feel good
to some of us to
always want to be surrounded by the yes
yes type of people
just take a look at countries where
leaders
limits the rights of its citizens
or ability to express their grievances
we have come too far and we have fought
too hard
to go back
for the men and women who sacrificed
their lives to pave the way for us
in the pursuit of freedom
we must and we have to do everything we
can to protect our right to assemble
in our rights
to a peaceful protest
thank you very much thank you Mr Speaker
I yield
the gentleman has healed the well
representative Crawford is recognized to
speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
colleagues the day I Rise to oppose
House Bill 505. there should always be a
cause for concern if bad policies are
pursued and implemented
under house bill 505 a person would be
guilty of a felony should they commit
the offense of a riot which is defined
as two or more persons doing an unlawful
act of violence or any other act in a
violent and tumultuous manner
I know that's convoluted and vague right
but let's look at what this really means
practically
some of my colleagues one in particular
just spoke about what this bill could do
to impact protest which is essential to
our democracy and the fundamental First
Amendment right
indeed I agree with his testimony and
Analysis however this bill could have
far more detrimental consequences in the
lives of other everyday Georgians
it won't only impact protesters but it
could impact others how do I know this
because case law tells me so
if we determine if we want to determine
how an amended bill will impact the
people all we have to do is look at what
the original bill has done in the past
and we don't have to look too far
our Georgia court of appeals previously
held that there was sufficient evidence
to charge teenagers under the same
statute because of their involvement in
proximity to a neighborhood fight
in this particular case a group of kids
got upset with one another exchanged
words and exchanged blows after those
words and this drew a crowd that has
nothing too uncommon from any of our
districts unfortunately
kids engage in fighting
but what this case law held is that
multiple kids involved even as
spectators
were charged under a misdemeanor at the
time of inciting a riot and
participating in a riot
and so now we're about to increase the
penalty for neighborhood fights amongst
our kids
doing so would be disastrous but I get
it some of you all are thinking to
yourselves that your child isn't the one
that's fighting right
well the Court's analysis wasn't that
simple it didn't solely focus on the
kids involved in the fight with the
Court held is that because the Essential
Elements of inciting a riot were in
pertinent in part engaging in conduct
which urges or advises others to Riot or
fight
a child preventing someone from breaking
up a fight
urging someone to fight or simply being
a bystander could also result in the
felony charge should this bill pass
surely I'm not advocating that our youth
engage in confrontation but if our
teenagers your teenagers have a lapse in
judgment and be involved in or
potentially be in proximity of a
confrontation they could face a felony
charge which will have a negative result
on their life's trajectory
now proponents of this bill May rely on
what they deem to be prosecutorial
discretion
and that's a way of them saying that a
prosecutor would have the ability to
charge someone
for any act but the biggest downside of
prosecutorial discretion is that it
often results in selective prosecution
and so a prosecutor's personal beliefs
and biases whether conscious or
unconscious can creep into their
decisions and like always the poor
minorities we know will be impacted
but House Bill 505 could also negatively
impact others outside of the poor
minorities
multiple kids can be vulnerable
a child watching a fight which many of
us have probably done in the past could
be detained for up to a year think about
that
and I know that we oftentimes choose
sides in the people's house but
immaturity is bipartisan a lapse in
judgment is bipartisan adolescent
misbehavior is bipartisan School fights
happen neighborhood fights happen the
irony is is that we teach Youth
Development on one hand but then we
create laws like this which could
deteriorate the future of our youth on
the other
but it won't stop at just kids
this bill could also have an impact on
someone at a football game potentially
at a tailgate should their actions rise
to what this definition says is a riot
this is a bad policy with clear legal
implications that threatens to harm the
lives of Georgians based on
self-ambitious politics of trying to
look tough on crime this bill will do
far more good than harm far more harm
than good and I urge my colleagues to
vote no on House Bill 505. thank you Mr
Speaker I yield the well
the gentleman has yielded the well
that completes those
desire to speak in opposition to the
bill now we'll hear
for 30 minutes up to 30 minutes
for those in favor of the bill
representative Reeves is recognized to
speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker I'm proud to speak
in favor of House Bill 505 this is a
very serious piece of legislation that
has far-reaching consequences for the
the safety of homes of businesses and of
uh our our private property here in
Georgia I'm here from the Suburban
perspective from Duluth and Swanee and
Sugar Hill my constituents work really
hard they play by the rules they've come
to Gwinnett County from all around
Georgia All Around America and all
around the world to work hard and live
by the American dream and they have
invested all across Atlanta including in
places that have been adversely uh
harmed by riots the last few years and
uh this bill will give you an
opportunity to stand up and defend the
rights of peaceful protesters but to
draw a clear line that peaceful protest
does not allow people to cross the line
into violence and to property
destruction if they choose to cross that
line from First Amendment free speech to
violence
and harm to people and property then
Georgia law is going to uh uh come down
on them under this bill free speech
your free speech rights end where the
other person's personal safety and
property begin that's a tradition in
America that this legislation honors
this legislation puts into state law and
sends a signal to troublemakers around
the country and you've seen the
phenomenon literally of having tourists
who come to certain areas and Destroy
property and harm people that they have
uh no ties to and that that happened
recently I had a mayor and two city
council members who came to a uh
conference that a lot of y'all had the
opportunity to attend and the night
before
they had gone out to eat in Atlanta and
they were a few blocks away from what
under this bill would be a riot and by
the way uh those protesters
most of them were not minorities and a
lot of them were not even from Georgia
and they they broke Windows they set uh
things on fire that was not free speech
that was not peaceful protest and that's
not the kind of thing we can afford
literally we can't afford to have that
going on in Atlanta or anywhere else in
Georgia both my parents grew up in
representative chokos's district and
Americus Georgia and his communities are
Main Street towns but mine are two in
Gwinnett County we've got a million
people there and they're about 15
communities and uh there are Decades of
hard work and investment in every home
and every business in my area and in
every uh small town in representative
chokis's district in Middle Georgia
where I spent five years and to have
people particularly outside protesters
coming to Georgia and harm people and
break things and damage property that's
not free speech that's not peaceful
protest and that is not the proud
Heritage that this state has of getting
out there and exercising peaceful
protests and persuading by the force of
reason and intellect and The Ballot Box
not by breaking windows and beating
people up
I told you about the mayor and council
member for my community who Could Have
Been In Harm's Way and uh they saw
businesses that were harmed by rioters I
also want to speak about someone from
Swanee who invested in an area between
here and the airport really close to
that Wendy's that got burned down after
a tragedy happened that should not have
happened but to respond to one tragedy
with going in and burning down a
restaurant that that doesn't make things
better and what it does is it makes
peaceful business owners like my
constituent from Swanee who was out
there serving patients and getting
medication to people with diabetes and
senior citizens it makes them worried
about investing in communities this bill
says in Georgia you'll be safe you could
speak your mind you could peacefully
protest but don't go hurt people and
break things
uh number three I had a high school
student recently contact me and say I
want to apply for this Georgia National
Guard scholarship at University of North
Georgia it was a North Gwinnett High
School student and three of us three or
four of us here in the room share that
High School cluster and this young lady
wants to uh go into public service and
military service part-time while getting
her college degree and then be obligated
to serve our state and the uh Georgia
National Guard after she graduates well
freedom is not free when there are
peaceful protesters law enforcement and
in some cases National Guard they're
obligated to protect those peaceful
protesters and that's good and Georgia
has a proud history judge boodle who I
got to hear he laid down the law in the
50s and 60s and he said law enforcement
is obligated to protect peaceful
protesters he was appointed by Calvin
Coolidge and he was still deciding cases
in the 60s and he was still speaking to
college students in the 90s judge
Griffin Bell he was appointed by
President Kennedy judge Bell who was
from Americus Georgia where
representative chokos is from he said
law enforcement military have an
obligation to protect peaceful
protesters but unfortunately as you saw
in 2020 law enforcement and the military
they get called out when all hell breaks
loose and when people are getting hurt
physically and when things are getting
broken and to have law-abiding
hard-working National Guard people and
law enforcement get called in to pick up
the pieces when people are getting hurt
and things are getting broken to me
that's unconscionable for us to have
anything to do with that we need to send
a message to Violent protesters and
people destroying property you can't do
that in Georgia we will listen to you
all day long you have a right to vote
you have a right to persuade you don't
have a right to harm people and property
in Georgia speaking to to the precedent
that representative chokis consulted in
drafting this bill is Loomis versus
State and it's Dixon versus state
speaking to the wording of the bill
any two or more persons who shall do an
unlawful act of violence violence not
free speech not peaceful protests but
violence or any other act in a violent
and tumultuous manner commit the offense
of Riot period that's it one sentence
long and both elements of that crime
require violence the tumultuous the
language of that is a mob it's mob rule
if you get together and have a mob that
crosses the line into violence that's
when Riot is declared under this statute
and it has made a felony
um I had some Korean constituents invite
me to a documentary that was well done
and it showed the tragedy that happened
in California in the 1990s after another
tragedy happened you had uh police
brutality and a minority uh was uh
assaulted by the police but then the
riot that occurred after that destroyed
the dreams
in the Korean community and in the
neighborhood there in in California and
people are still traumatized decades
later from both the police incident as
well as the aftermath that was Riot and
we can't have rioting here in Georgia
people are entitled to live in their
homes and run their businesses large or
small without the fear of mob Rule and
violence and that's why I'm proud to
support this bill and I would encourage
you to read the bill and to make a clear
stand that Georgia is a safe place to
live and to do business to peacefully
protest to speak your mind and exercise
your first amendment rights but Georgia
is not a place where Riley Riot and
violence are tolerated thank you
the gentleman has yielded the well
that completes the discussion for those
opposed and those in favor
is there any objection to the previous
question being ordered
the chair here has done the previous
question is ordered now we'll have the
Chairman's time up to 20 minutes
chairman Jay Collins chair of the
committee from which this bill came is
recognized to speak to the Bill thank
you Mr Speaker I'm going to keep my
comments brief because I don't believe I
can say anything that'll change anyone's
mind if mine's probably already made up
you've been down to my office in 218
you'll see that I have a 24 by 36
collage
and it was from several years ago and I
was had the privilege of meeting
Congressman John Lewis
you see before I became a state
representative I was mayor of my little
Community out in Villa Rica Georgia
we honored the 50th anniversary of the
Freedom Riders out there
and I got to meet a living legend and I
got to talk to him
and I I still consider him to be one of
the greatest men that I have ever met we
were the only city in this state who
honored that 50th anniversary of that
freedom rider bus
coming through Georgia as it traveled
and I was very proud of that day for my
community to see the light the the look
on people's faces that lived through the
terrible times that Congressman Lewis
had to go through and to be able to meet
a hero what a great day it was for my
district My Town my community I was very
proud of that
and I said that to say this
we should protect peaceful protesters
at all expense at all cost
today we have peacefully protested
against each other in this chamber we
have spoke our mind and we have spoke
our position
there's no violence ladies and gentlemen
I think the number one and it's been
said before and I'll say it again right
here the number one priority for
government should be to protect persons
and property
you know these these uh protesters that
we have seen I want to call them
protesters excuse me let me call them
writers because that's what they are
they're they're really not from our
state they're being paid to come in here
to write to loot to cause chaos and
havoc in our communities my district is
fine if we don't pass this legislation
my district is fine majority of your
districts will be fine but I'm thinking
about some of those people that live in
the impoverished economically depressed
areas that experience right and looting
and the the turmoil and the fear that
many of those residents had when they
turned on the news when they looked down
their street and they saw their City
burning
they saw a police force that wasn't
doing anything about it
ladies and gentlemen we have to take
steps in this house to protect people
and I think a lot of attention has been
drawn away from the fact that this has
to do with riding not peaceful protests
I would stand here I will fight for
people in the hall I will fight for
people in my district in your District
to peacefully protest any day of the
week but make no mistake gentlemen
gentlemen and gentle women here in this
chamber this is not about peaceful
protesters this is about riding and
sending a clear message that we want to
protect everyone from Every zip code
from every district and we want to
protect persons and property and that's
all I have to say about that Mr Speaker
and I'm going to yield the balance of my
time to a whipper
chairman has yielded his time the
remainder of his time to went Burchette
representing burchett is recognized to
speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker and thank you
colleagues well we're into the thick of
it now aren't we this is uh this is what
we're here for this is what it's all
about the the debate I appreciate the
colleagues on both sides of this issue
uh but I'm just here to clarify a few
things and and this and boil it down
into plain plain language
this is about two policy perspectives
here
are you in favor of making Riot a felony
and are you in favor of requiring that
someone that is charged with a riot to
sit before a superior court judge before
they have Bond that's it we're not
changing the definition of riot we're
not changing we're not adding a Fray
we're not adding inciting a riot though
my colleagues have argued that I believe
that they're off base on the argument
the only thing we are changing is if you
are charged and convicted with uh being
a party to a riot then it could be you
can serve it'll be a felony not a
misdemeanor and that's it
this uh this business about
um inciting a riot I would point you to
the bill just look at the bill
um I'll walk through it with you if you
like
section one
um
the language on 14 to 15 that's the
language that changes from misdemeanor
to a felony that's the that's the only
change there
section two
we're adding line 22 Riot to the crimes
that you must sit before Superior Court
Judge to to receive a bond
no inciting a ride
Noah Frey none of those things we're not
changing the definition of Orion we're
not expanding the definition of Orion
that is that's a fallacy to think that
the argument that this could be an
affray is
is unfounded because in an affray the
element of
um
doing doing a violent act in concert is
not there and a Fray is just an affray
it's a fight
we're not we're not acting together
violently to destroy the streets of
Fulton County and Atlanta we're not
we're not burning uh police cars we're
not tearing up the local businesses and
and hey you all were here a lot of you
were here a lot of you weren't here
because we have a large freshman class
but I recall those days I remember the
leaders of Atlanta Georgia standing at
the Capitol steps asking pleading please
please
please
peacefully protest don't destroy my
business that I've worked for my entire
life my kids my grandparents have
started I remember that do you all
remember that
I remember that this is this is the
policy that we are putting forward today
to the House of Representatives of
Georgia is that it's not okay to come to
Atlanta to come to Georgia and and
because you're upset
destroy
our livelihoods just commit violence on
our Georgia Citizens many of you recall
just recently with the public safety
center we had uh several individuals
that were charged with a riot and in 48
hours two of those individuals were
already out
and and they were not even from the
state of Georgia as I understand they
come here
to run them up
we're that's not Georgia that's not
Georgia and while I appreciate my my
colleagues
um
debating on the opposite side of this I
would just point you straight to the
bill
we're not talking about inciting rights
we're not talking about afraid we're
talking about
what the crime and penalty will be if
you are taking part in a riot and so I
would ask an employer each and every
member here vote for the bill I know
we're gonna likely vote party lines and
that's fine that's okay I understand
but I'd appreciate if we could just work
toward
um some common ground at some point on
some of these issues that
I think we need to be the leaders of in
in this state and lead lead our
districts back home and say hey we can
work together so I'm going to leave you
all with that I certainly appreciate the
opportunity to speak to you and listen I
appreciate serving when each and every
one of you every day so thank you for
all all of what you do and please vote
February for this Bill thank you Mr
Speaker
the gentleman has yielded the well
that completes our discussion on the
bill is there any objection to agreeing
to the report of the committee which was
favorable to the passage of the bill
chair here's none the report of the
committee is agreed to shall this bill
now pass all in favor of the passage of
the bill will vote Yes all those opposed
will vote no and the clerk will unlock
the machine
close yeah
unreal
oh my God
for what purpose does representative
Bruce rise
parliamentary inquiry State your inquiry
is it not true that if my brother and I
who happened to have a common interest
s were out protesting
and someone attacked us because they
didn't agree with us
and we defended ourselves and it turned
out to be a pretty bloody fight
that I would now go from
self-defense to a felony
under this bill
if the gentleman slow States I'm sure
that's how he understands the bill
for what purpose does chairman chokos
rise parliamentary inquiry State your
inquiry
Mr Speaker
we have been talking about violence
and isn't it true
that
one of our two Nobel Peace Prize winners
the Reverend Martin Dr Luther Reverend
Dr Martin Luther King said non-violence
is a powerful and just weapon
which Cuts without wounding
and in Nobles the man who wields it
it is a sword that heals thank you Mr
Speaker
I'm sure the gentleman believes
everything he just said
representative Roman is recognized
for what purposes she rise thank you Mr
Speaker parliamentary inquiry State
inquiry is it not true that the words
property and business do not appear
anywhere in this bill and the best way
to protect peaceful protesters is to
vote no on this bill
yet the lady so States I'm sure she
believes that
for what purposes represent representing
matahan rise
parliamentary inquiry Mr Speaker State
your inquiry isn't it true that this
bill would prevent the all too common
occurrence of a violent Rider being
arrested before lunch and released on
bail in time for dinner
well I'm sure the gentleman States
that's that's his reading of the bill
for what purpose does
representing Becky Evans rise
inquiry statue inquiry thank you isn't
it true that in committee we heard from
uh testimony that the definition of a
riot had not been updated in over a
hundred years and if my colleague the
majority whip says he wants to work with
us I would hope that
we could work on updating that case law
thank you if the Lady Sue States I'm
sure that's what she heard
we're going to finish this one I'm going
to do a couple more inquiries we'll go
to uh let's see for what purpose does
representative manner rise
parliamentary inquiry
isn't it true that state inquiry thank
you Mr Speaker isn't it true that kids
on buses are fighting and this would be
considered a riot and if we don't
protect the kids from rioting on school
buses not only will these kids end up
being felons but then we put ourselves
in a predicament because parents once
this bill is passed they'll question
what are the schools doing about all of
these felon rioters and in addition to
that Mr Speaker there are several
instances and Pernell Harris who died
while handcuffs were on him he was beat
by police officers here in Georgia does
that mean Mr Speaker that these police
officers have now committed a felony
the lady has good questions and I'm sure
her
reading of the bill will help her answer
those questions or she can speak to the
author I'm going to take two more
two more
recognized
for what purpose is represent
represented Hughley rise
parliamentary income Mr Speaker State
your inquiry Mr Speaker isn't it true
that at the end of the day uh when
police officers make the arrest they're
the ones who putting the charges on
these individuals and it's going to cost
parents and family members a lot more
money to get people out of jail so that
they can go and then uh have their day
in court and be afforded the opportunity
so this is this is going to cost more
money for individual citizens uh isn't
it true further true that people who
break the law are not watching us
and know that we're making this a higher
penalty but families are the ones that
are going to suffer
I appreciate the ladies View and I know
she believes in what she speaks is true
for what purposes representative Holcomb
rise
parliamentary inquiry State your inquiry
Mr Speaker isn't it true that while I
support the goal of
opposing the destruction of property in
the commission of violence that Georgia
courts have interpreted this statute
as being that all persons sharing in a
riot are guilty whether or not their
conduct was in fact violent and
tumultuous and that is very concerning
I'm sure the gentleman believes that
it's a learner practitioner of the law
and a dedicated reader of legislation so
we appreciate your
insight
what purpose does representative Neil
rise
parliamentary inquiry State inquiry is
it not true that the issue people have
is that if we are turning this to a
felony the issue of discretion being
used misused and substituted for another
charge
instead of using afraid or the
appropriate charge Riot being used in
substitution of that and that is what is
giving
a lot of a lot of members in this body
pause
well I've heard several opinions about
several different parts of the how you
interpret what we were talking about
where we're debating what I do
know that the gentlelady believes just
what she speaks to be the truth and
that's how that's her understanding
this is the last one
what purpose is Chairman Sainz rise
parliamentary inquiry State your inquiry
is it not true that some would like to
scapegoat this issue to youth
misbehavior and civil protests but that
this bill actually addresses those who
would like to desecrate our first
amendment rights by instilling Terror
and fear in this very City in the small
business and minority-owned businesses
all across the state
I'm sure the gentleman believes of what
he States
have all members voted
have all members voted I think we've
thoroughly discussed this proposition
have all members voted that I believe
they have so the clerk will lock the
machine
on the passage of the bill the yeas were
98 the Nays 73 the bill having received
the requisite constitutional majority is
therefore passed
Mr Clark will you read the caption to HB
500.
household 500 by representative silcox
the 53rd and others to be entitled an
act two men article 3 chapter 7 the
title 16 either fish go to George
annotated relating arson and explosives
this was a revived for the offensive
arson of the law enforcement vehicle
this bill ever referred to the Committee
on Public Safety and Homeland Security
that committee recommends that this bill
do pass
thank you Mr clerk I'll remind the
members
that the rules committee had limited
debate on this issue to uh one hour
30 minutes will be allocated equally to
each side to be allocated between
themselves as they see fit those opposed
and certainly those in favor
again that does not include the
presentation by the author or the 20
minutes for the Minority Report or the
Chairman's time
that's what we're going to do
this time chair lady silcox is
recognized to present the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
ladies and gentlemen of the house I
bring to you today House Bill 500
House Bill 500 provides that anyone by
means of fire or explosives that
knowingly causes encourages or procures
another to set fire to a law enforcement
vehicle would be guilty of the crime of
arson of a law enforcement vehicle
anyone found guilty of this crime would
be punchable by fond of a hundred
thousand dollars and or five to twenty
years and there is no mandatory minimum
sentence
a police vehicle is the primary tool
with which our dedicated officers
enforce our criminal laws
they are equipped with specialized
equipment often bringing the cost of
these vehicles well over a hundred
thousand dollars
these vehicles are paid for with our
hard-earned taxpayer dollars and given
our computer chip shortage are not easy
to replace in these times moreover
there are many police departments in
Georgia that do not have backup vehicles
or if they do they are usually older
with outdated equipment
that is the bill Mr Speaker and I will
yield for any questions
the lady has yielded for questions and
you do you have one from representative
Jasmine Clark to your left
representative Clark is recognized for a
question
thank you Mr Speaker does a gentlelady
yield I do
um I'm curious isn't arson already a
crime in Georgia yes it is so what
exactly is this bill doing that is not
already done in the state of Georgia
well again as I as I was trying to
explain represent Clark because these
vehicles are increasingly hard to
replace and are increasingly more
expensive I think it's important that we
have a special crime for this because
this is taking a car that our that is
our policeman's primary tool out of
service in many counties may only have
two or three patrol cars at their
disposal
and so you're not only just taking a car
out of service you're taking a tool that
is protecting people many many people
out of service
thank you thank you
lady has another question if you'll
yield yes yes I will the gentleman from
the 172nd representative Chaz Cannon has
a question to your right thank you Mr
Speaker do you yield I do isn't it true
that this bill will continue this body's
mission to better protect the same law
enforcement officers who protect us each
and every day absolutely thank you so
much
is the lady yielding for another
question of course
representing McCullum is recognized for
a question
to your left in the back oh here we go
to yield I do
isn't it true that if you come to our
state and to cause trouble
and you burn a public safety vehicle
that your stay might be longer with this
bill
and hinder our Public Safety to try to
protect others yes thank you very much
thank you
if there are no further questions Mr
Speaker I'll yield the well
you have a question but you have the
discretion you can do it okay all right
you'll take another question yes sir it
was about 20 or 30 but you can get
started on them we will join you after
lunch let's see we'll we'll recognize um
the lady from the 142nd represent Paris
for a question
I
was just wondering how were you able to
get a graphic
of such
vividness
on the board I've never seen that happen
before
you know that I I hadn't I wasn't aware
of that okay thank you thank you thank
you thank you Mr Speaker
to the ladies Paul we do have
visual displays from time to time and
that one is pretty vivid so I'm going to
recognize the lady from the 142nd
representative Hughley for a question to
your left thank you Mr Speaker does the
gentlelady yield I do can you give us
the how many how often uh this this
crime that we're we're making a crime
happen how often
do we have police cars being set on fire
by arson in this state how many happened
last year you know I don't have those
statistics but I've seen plenty on the
news
thank you
I have two more questions you do if the
lady in the world will yield to
representative Wilkerson to your left in
the back of the room
thank you Mr Speaker there's a
gentlelady yield I do thank you two
quick questions I I am curious about
this is a bicycle considered a vehicle
in Georgia
is it what a bicycle considered a
vehicle in Georgia
I believe it is yes okay under this bill
would that be considered arson of a
vehicle and punishable by the same
penalties if you belong this is
specifically a law enforcement vehicle
no law I mean but by law is agility
further yield I do bicycle cops we have
cops that ride bicycles yes so in this
case it would be a police vehicle with
this qualifies arson or that vehicle and
suffer the same penalties
technically no I don't know that you
could burn up a bicycle I can blow up a
bicycle if you see a 12 year old
I don't think it has any gas in it to be
explosive
[Music]
you have one more question if you'll
yield for one more certainly German
Powell to your right chairman Ellen
Powell thank you Mr Speaker
I will under your bell is it not true
that when someone sets fire deliberately
sets fire to a police vehicle that's
almost synonymous to attacking a police
officer
I would agree
for the deal yes is it not also true
that this sends a stronger message to
have respect for those men and women
that are out there enforcing the law
to protect everybody even those Riders
because when they try to burn a police
vehicle then they can also damage other
people by doing that same not only being
disrespectful but they could also put
other people's lives in danger yes sir I
thank you for the question thank you
ma'am
there are no further questions I'll
yield the will
the lady has yielded the well
chair will recognize representative
Kennard to speak to the bill
representative Kennard you have up to 30
minutes
showing opposition to the bill and then
there are a few folks who want to speak
in favor but represent Canada recognized
thank you Mr Speaker I come to speak to
HB 500 today to be clear
if someone torches a law enforcement
vehicle
they have done something seriously wrong
they have committed a crime
it's inexcusable
and there should be consequences
if someone commits the act of arson to a
law enforcement vehicle
they're dead wrong they've committed a
crime
it's inexcusable and there should be
consequences and that's why I love HB
500.
the first page
lines 1 through 15. I'm in complete
support of it if it was just that I
would press the green button
but when I turn to page two
I'm disheartened and I have issue
because lines 16 17 and 18
it says imprisonment for not less than
five years
that establishes a mandatory minimum
that establishes a mandatory minimum
mandatory minimum sentencing
haven't we learned our lessons with this
horrible policy before we've all seen
this movie we We Know How It Ends
I mean this is Draconian measures from
the 1980s and 1990s
horrible policy that many lawmakers that
were involved in that in the 80s and 90s
now regret and understand that it
decimated communities and created mass
incarceration policies from the 80s and
the 90s what's next are we going to
bring back mullets and parachute pants
listen mullets were just a bad idea I
knew that because I supported one for
way too long
as a matter of fact when I first started
dating my wife Pam
for the first few days I was wearing a
mullet had been for years after about a
few days of our courtship she finally
said you know what
I like you a lot
there's promise in this relationship I'm
hopeful but the mullet has to go
and when I look back on pictures now she
was absolutely right
what was I thinking when I looked at
that picture
mandatory minimum sentencing is also a
bad idea what were we thinking when we
saw that but again we learned from that
that it's bad policy a mentor friend of
mine who's now deceased he's a pastor I
worked for him for a number of years in
Columbus Georgia Pastor Jim swilley
he would often tell me Greg there is
nothing to be learned from the second
kick of a mule
should have learned it the first time
we learned through mandatory minimum
sentencing that it created mass
incarceration that we're still grappling
with now that we're still trying to
unwind and correct with uh reforms
that
mandatory minimum sentencing created
mass incarceration at such a level in
this country that we skyrocketed our
incarcerated population to
world we topped the world and the people
who are incarcerated in our country the
U.S has four percent of the world's
population but we have 25 percent of the
world's prison population which means
that one in four incarcerated
individuals are so in the United States
of America the land of the free
ironically
and guess what among all the 50 states
in the U.S
the state that leads the nation and
people who are incarcerated and or under
criminal uh Community Supervision does
anybody want to guess who the U.S leader
is
I'll give you a hint it starts with a g
Georgia
an old sweet song
I can't let uh representative Dexter
sharper
handle all the singing around here
well we are so punitive in the state we
lead the nation
we have more people on probation than
any other state we are four times the
national average we have so many
criminal records in our gcic system that
the gcic staff cannot keep up with its
management there are 10.7 million people
in our state there are 4.5 million
individuals that have a criminal record
in 2018 is when I ran for office to be a
part of this body
and I was very excited to come down here
because it was on the heels
of the Nathan Deal era of Criminal
Justice Reform and I was such a fan that
we were now going in the right direction
on these matters
and and I was so excited to be a part of
this body and to work with you on
continuing and building upon the legacy
of Governor deal and expanding criminal
justice reforms
but to my dismay what I've actually been
doing for the last four years now in my
fifth year is protecting that Legacy is
fighting for that Legacy defending that
Legacy because for five years now I have
seen measure after measure that chips
away at that Legacy
that erodes that Legacy
we have done a an about face on Criminal
Justice Reform and this measure is proof
positive of that we have separate
branches of government for a reason
our job as legislators is to make laws
so page one of this bill
is our lane we Define what a crime is
but there's a separate branch that is
supposed to meet out punishment and
consequences and that are there are
elected judges the Judiciary Branch they
are to listen in court to the facts of
the case to consider the context to
parse out the details to weigh all the
evidence the prosecution the defense and
after all that analysis then they meet
out a consequence or a sentence
that fits the Contour of that crime
page two
to the domain of the Judiciary
we need to stay in our own lane let's
make laws but let's not try to handle
sentencing in this body
thank you for your time and for these
reasons I cannot support this bill I
would like to I would like to has merits
the page two defeats that for me
thank you Mr Speaker I yield the will
the gentleman has yielded the well
we have some folks who want to speak in
favor of the bill
representative Daniel is recognized to
speak to the bill representative Daniel
thank you Mr Speaker
I rise today in support of House Bill
500. I know how riots can impact all
small businesses but even more
importantly minority and
underrepresented communities not just in
Atlanta but all over our state like mine
I'm supporting this legislation because
underrepresented people and districts
just like the one that I represent
deserve the same opportunity to benefit
from Public Safety just as much as the
rest of the state
this has not necessarily been true in
recent times
as we have witnessed individuals from
outside of Georgia and citing violence
during what otherwise would have been
peaceful and at times needed
demonstrations it is essential to
emphasize that those who come from other
states to cause trouble will face
consequences if they choose to misdirect
the attention from the important matters
at hand
by attempting to burn a law enforcement
vehicle we are creating a sense of panic
in our state they will be subject to
just penalties for the damage and crimes
that they commit if they do such a crime
through this through this bill we intend
to demonstrate our unwavering support
and appreciation for the law enforcement
officials who Safeguard our small
businesses and communities during
violent times
and I emphasize again violent riots we
will always welcome peaceful
demonstrations and protect them because
they are so vital to our thriving
representative democracy we will not
condone violent actions that ultimately
disaffect underrepresented communities
and every taxpayer in the state of
Georgia I ask for your favorable
consideration of House Bill 500 and I
yelled the wealth
lady has yielded The Well of
Representative Crowe
presented Crowe is recognized to speak
to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker ladies and
gentlemen I'll be fairly brief hopefully
the day is long and lunchtime is near
um I stand here to support House Bill
500 many things have been said already
so I don't want to repeat a lot of
what's been said the one thing that I
did want to point out are a couple of
things I wanted to point out though
um
arson of a law enforcement vehicle is
not just destructive it's not just
dangerous
but it's an assault on Law and Order
itself
these men and women in law enforcement
and the institutions of law enforcement
agencies
are out there to go out and enforce the
laws that we pass in this very chamber
and they are our Representatives that go
out and actually enforce the laws that
we make in this building and when you
burn one of the vehicles it's an assault
on Law and Order all across the state
and to Mr Kennards point or
representative kenner's point I did want
to address that real quick I agree with
you I'm a fan of Page one as well page
two though as far as a mandatory minimum
on line 17
it says that it shall be punished by a
fine of not more than a hundred thousand
dollars or
by imprisonment for not less than five
years nor more than 20 years or both
so the judge doesn't have to sentence
anybody to jail they can simply issue a
fine if the judge's discretion causes
them to want to do that so but ladies
and gentlemen there are a lot of things
that that can be charged in multiple
ways this is a a clear statement to
those that want to come here and and
violate our law and damage our streets
and damage our businesses and burn our
police cars that we are going to support
law and order in this state and we're
going to support the men and women who
go out and enforce that Law and Order
and enforce the laws that we create in
this chamber thank you I yield the will
the gentleman has yielded the well
that's all of our speakers on this issue
so let's see not quite all of them but
is there any objection to the previous
question being ordered a chair has done
the previous question is ordered so now
we'll move on to chairs Chairman's time
we have 20 minutes allocated for
Chairman's time
chairman Jay Collins is recognized to
speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker once again I'm
going to be brief with my comments
the fact where he even had to stand here
and talk about this
is is an issue within itself
but I want to I want to submit to you
here today ladies and gentlemen
look at that photograph right there
and I challenge you each and every time
you see a peace officer driving the
patrol car
more often than not you'll see the
winners are tended
imagine what happens when someone is
attacking that car
but doesn't know that there's somebody
in custody in handcuffs in the back of
that car
think about that for a minute
again
the number one priority for government
is to protect persons and property
and ladies and gentlemen you can't do
that if you don't have a flute of
vehicles
we have seen what these paid protesters
paid Riders are doing throughout our
country throughout this state
majority of these people are not our
homegrown folks they're people that are
coming in here from other states
even other countries and that's another
issue would need to be debating sometime
maybe up a little above higher above the
pay grade than what we are here but I
submit to you ladies and gentlemen
the fact that we have to discuss this is
an issue within itself and we need to
send a clear and strong message that
we're not going to tolerate this
Behavior here in the state of Georgia
that's all I have to say Mr Speaker I
gladly yield the Chairman's time to my
good friend Houston Gaines
the gentleman has yielded the well
representative Gaines is recognized to
speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker and thank you Mr
chairman I want to thank
chairman silcox for her leadership on
this bill and bringing this before the
body
and as chairman Collins said it's it's
frankly uh concerning that we even have
to discuss this the pictures that we've
seen
this is and just didn't happen just a
couple years ago you know we I think
many of us in this room were hoping that
when the defund the police movement
happened it was short-lived it wasn't
something we'd continue to see year
after year but that sentiment is still
around and it's something we still
have to address and I think this
legislation sends a very important
signal that individuals who want to go
after our Law Enforcement Officers will
be punished they'll be put behind bars
here in Georgia we're going to hold
criminals accountable those individuals
are not welcome in our state who are
trying to go after our law enforcement
officers and I just again want to thank
chairman silcox
for bringing this bill before us of
course we support peaceful protests in
Georgia and have a long history of doing
so but individuals who go and put police
cars on fire and we saw that just a
couple couple weeks ago in a couple
weeks ago in January we had a front page
of the Atlanta paper we had a police car
that was set on fire it's an
embarrassment to our state that's why we
need to put it into it and I believe
this legislation is a strong signal that
we will not welcome individuals who are
going to put police cars on fires and
riot in the streets and put individuals
in individual lives in danger in Georgia
and so again thank you chairman silcox
for your leadership chairman Collins and
I'd ask for this body's favorable
consideration of house bill 500.
that completes our debate on the bill
is there an objection to agreeing to the
report of the committee which was
favorable to the passage of the bill
chair hears none the report of the
committee has agreed to
shall this bill now pass all in favor of
the passage of the bill will vote Yes
all those opposed will vote no and the
clerk will unlock
the machine
for what purpose does represent
representative floral leader McDonald
rise
pulmonary Enquirer States or inquiry
isn't it true that I was a fireman for
27 years
if the gentleman of those States I'm
sure that's accurate another pulmonary
choir State your inquiry
isn't what we saw on the screen it's
bigger than just the vehicle it's what's
around the vehicle those that live
around the vehicle it's the those that
are responding uh the firemen that are
responding from their station putting
citizens at risk as they're responding
isn't that uh more than more danger than
just the vehicle itself
I'm sure the gentleman believes
everything he just said and it's
grounded in fact
for what purpose does representing main
arise
thank you Mr Speaker parliamentary
inquiry State your inquiry is it not
true that I do agree with the bill the
problem I have with the bill is that
aggravated assault with intent to murder
rape or Rob that minimum sentences is
one year
and this sentence is a minimum of five
years and I do wish this body would look
more closely into crimes against women
is that not true
I'm sure the lady believes what she so
speaks
for what purpose does representative
Holly rise
parliamentary inquiry State your inquiry
Mr Speaker is it not true that
while many of us here appreciate
and certainly can speak to the benefits
of having a very strong law enforcement
body in this state
we also understand that we have laws
already on the books like felony
criminal damage to property
16-7-23 ocga that is already available
to make sure that these penalties are
addressed but that we also
further do appreciate
from hearing from Republicans our
colleagues here
that they do not appreciate
the expensive destruction of a capital
including Atlanta as well as the
nation's capital on January 6th
I'm sure the gentleman believes what he
so speaks he's kind of hit it off in a
different direction
so for what purpose does representative
Reese
rise
parliamentary inquiry Mr Speaker the
state you inquiry Mr Speaker isn't it
true that the D.A of Atlanta was able to
found charges to charge the individuals
that committed the horrific crime of the
picture that we saw on the screen and
that this same D.A will be in charge of
applying this law if it was to pass and
that you would have to ask yourself is
this law even necessary if we found laws
to charge them with from the initial
crime that has been incited in this body
by this picture that was on the screen
that's good when I think yeah I know
that a gentleman believes everything he
just said and I'm not sure how what the
D.A charged so I'll have to admit that
for what purposes representative Miller
rise thank you Mr Speaker parliamentary
inquiry State your inquiry isn't it true
Mr Speaker that there was one police car
from the city of Atlanta that has been
burned
just one I'm sure the lady knows of what
she speaks further inquiry Mr Speaker
State your inquiry Mr Speaker isn't it
true that we have the offenses already
on our books of criminal damage to
property arson
um and excuse me domestic terrorism that
would adequately cover the offense of
burning a law enforcement vehicle
I'm sure the lady believes what she
speaks and I'm sure she has knowledge
for what purposes representative alcoya
rise
thank you Mr Speaker
um do you have a parliamentary inquiry
in there representative yes
parliamentary inquiry inquiry
um
Mr Speaker isn't it true that for every
action there is a reaction
okay I think that's true
and what I have seen today uh bills
against
reactions and none for action
the graphic image we saw today
what if
what if
the officer incited that riot
and we haven't said anything about that
so it is important to balance it let's
also look at action as we look at
reactions thank you Mr Speaker
thank you for that parliamentary inquiry
representative I'm sure the gentleman
believes and understands what he speaks
to we we're going to do a couple more
and then we're going to uh
close this machine
the gentle lady from the 170th District
chair lady Houston Police recognized for
a question parliamentary inquiry
States you inquiry is it not true that I
was in Atlanta the night the police cars
were burned and they were busting into
different bikes and things on Peachtree
and isn't it not true that for somebody
that doesn't live here it's mighty scary
to be here when things like that are
going on
[Music]
isn't it not true that I don't know why
people can't understand that Georgia
people don't do this and so don't come
to Georgia if you're going to burn a
police car a break into businesses we
don't want it thank you I'm sure the
lady feels very strongly of her
statement
we're going to recognize one more and I
think she had a chance to speak but she
may have a question about her statement
so let's see
I'm gonna recognize a lady from the
117th representative Daniel for what
purpose do you rise Mr Speaker is it not
true that these events
disproportionately affect minority
communities and that this bill would
increase the punishments for people from
outside of the state that seek to hijack
peaceful protests thus silencing those
voices
I'm sure the lady has her facts and
knows of what she speaks I said I wasn't
going to take anymore but I'm going to
take one more the lady from the 93rd
representative Carter is recognized for
what purpose is the lady from the 93rd
right parliamentary inquiry State
inquiry is it not true that it's
starting to sound like this bill is
against the minority Community is that
not true
I don't think that's true I haven't
heard that I've heard some very robust
appreciate the ladies uh comment but
I've heard very robust respectful
conversation as we've debated this bill
and I'll go and say it right now I do I
do appreciate that from the membership
we've um we've debated a couple bills
here that strong feelings on and y'all
all are to become complimented on your
conduct and how you discussed the bill
that uh completes our parliamentary
inquiries and we're going to uh
I think we have them all voted to save
all members voted have all members voted
if so the clerk will lock the machine
the yeas were r100 on the passage of the
bill and the Nays are 69
this bill having received a record was
at constitutional majority is therefore
passed
we're going to take up a couple more
bills before we break for lunch
a couple more bills we're now going to
ask the clerk to read the caption to HB
63.
House Bill 63 by representative Williams
is 148th and others to be entitled an
act to amend code section 33 30 13.1
with the official code of Georgia
annotated relating to Furnishing claims
experienced policyholders so as they
require insurers to providing policies

this bill that refer to the committee on
insurance that committee recommends that
this bill do pass
chairman Noel Williams is recognized to
present the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
colleagues I'm bringing to you today
house bill
63. this bill would improve
Communications between insurance
companies and their clients when I'm
speaking of Insurance I'm talking about
group health insurance for 20 or more
covered employees
60 days out before their renewal They
will receive detailed claims experience
along with their renewal and this way
it'll make it clear to the employer
group
why the group could be changed why the
rates could be going up or why the rates
stay the same and this Mr Speaker is my
bill right now self-funded and level
funding groups get claims experience for
three or more covered lives and we just
think it would be fair and Equitable for
20 or more fully insured lives that are
covered under a Group Health Plan
receive claims experience to the
insurance broker as well as to the group
itself
you have no questions thank you Mr
Speaker colleagues I appreciate your

act to amend part 3 of article 7 chapter
3 Title 20 official go to George and
Antonia relating to Georgia student
finance Authority so as to provide for
student loan repayment for peace
officers this bill I've referred to the
committee on higher education that
committee recommends that this bill do
pass by committee substitute
representative gamble is recognized to
present the bill
thank you Mr Speaker members of the
house I rise today to present to you
house bill 130. House Bill 130 is
Governor Kemp's administrative
initiative the Georgia peace officers
service loan repayment program the
purpose of this program is to recruit
and retain Public Law Enforcement
Officers across the state of Georgia
currently according to the Georgia
Sheriff's Association and the police
Chiefs Association we are somewhere
around four to five thousand police
officers peace officers short in the
state of Georgia this legislation builds
upon what we did as a legislature last
year by adding criminal justice degrees
to high the high demand career
initiative to be eligible for the Hope
career Grant
law enforcement officers are critical to
protecting the citizens of this state
but are often faced with a decision
between heeding the call to public
service or seeking other opportunities
to pay student loans
to ensure that we're retaining top
talent we are looking to implement and
invest 3.2 million dollars in a loan
repayment plan for state and local law
enforcement this plan funds up to 800
officers and will provide a loan
repayment of up to twenty thousand
dollars per officer in exchange for five
years of service so if you are a new
officer coming in and you have student
loans from a course of study in any area
you are eligible as of January of one of
this year to participate in this program
and to receive up to twenty thousand
dollars in loan forgiveness for coming
into law enforcement and working five
years if you are an existing law
enforcement officer and you decide that
you want to go back to school and to get
a degree in criminal justice you can
also take advantage of this program and
be eligible for up to twenty thousand
dollars if you work five years towards
uh law enforcement for this program so
Mr Speaker the funds for this spot this
program are in the governor's budget
report for fy24 that is the legislation
I'm happy to answer any questions that
you may have anyone may have about House
Bill 130. gentleman you're for a
question I will yield
representative Jasmine Clark to your
left is recognized for a question thank
you Mr Speaker that's my friend yield I
yielded my good friend yes all right so
we discussed this bill quite a bit in
the committee
um and uh we finally got to the part on
retention where current Law Enforcement
Officers can
um get loans repaid
through this through this program is
that correct that is correct that's
gentleman further you I yield all right
so after thinking about that doesn't
that basically say that they just have
to take out a loan in order for us to
pay off the loan that we're making them
take out so we're not actually paying
off current officers on loans instead
we're basically just paying them to go
to school if they want to that is
correct that is the difference between
the individual that would be coming in
as of January 1 of this year or the
individual that is currently in that
position you you are correct in what
you're saying thank you
Mr Speaker with that I would ask for
this body's favorable consideration of
House Bill 130 and I yield the well

Paulding County regularly I'm sure thank

Biden did on this subject

House Bill 318 by president of Hilton of
the of the 48th be entitled knack to
amend chapter 2 a title 20 the official
go to Georgia annotated related to
Elementary and secondary education
so to provide for the re-establishment
of the office of Charter School
compliance under the state Charter
Schools commission this bill ever
referred the committee on education the
committee recommends that this bill do
pass by committee substitute
chair recognizes representative Hilton
to present the bill
thank you madam speaker and
distinguished colleagues today I'm
honored to present to you house bill 318
household 318 eliminates a funding and
service redundancy in state government
by shifting all Charter School oversight
responsibilities to one single agency
specifically the state Charter School
commission which is the state agency
laser focused on Charter School
authorization support and oversight
the ship will ensure that our local
boards received enhanced support
required to consistently perform above
the state school board education
authorizer standards the state Charter
School commission will promote
transparent And Timely Communications
with the state board so that appropriate
interventions mediation and other
strategies can be employed if and when
issues arise
there's no new responsibilities or
funding associated with this legislation
this is a simple reorganization that
results in a more responsive state
government to our local authorizers
there's also no change in the current
authorization process between the State
Board charter schools and local
authorizers
finally House Bill 318 provides
Financial transparency by requiring
local school district authorizers and
the state authorizer to itemize how they
spend the administrative withhold fees
they receive from charter schools
with that I will yield for questions
chair recognizes representative McDonald
for a question
does the gentleman yield yes sir can you
repeat everything you just said because
I think the gentleman for the 18th
probably didn't understand a thing you
said it so quickly yes sir go ahead and
settle in here we go thank you Mr Madam
speaker for uh
I'll come over and deliver it to you
I'll yield for any other questions share
recognizes representative Bruce for a
question
well the gentleman you yes sir just
trying to get clarification
is this going to take
the ability for the local school boards
to determine if there's going to be a
charter school in their area or not no
that that Authority will continue to
remain the same as it is today
okay well the gentleman yield for
another question yes sir will there be
any change in how funding
goes you know right now the local school
systems
if they Charter in school they pretty
much fund the school it funds from them
is that going to change no sir no change
in how they're funded okay thank you
chair recognizes representative Glazier
for a question
does the gentleman yield yes ma'am
is it correct that this build is just an
opportunity for oversight that directly
relates to Charter Schools being
governed by those who are in that space
yes correct as I mentioned my comments
we have an agency that's this is all
they do 100 of the day and so we are now
aligning state government so that you've
got a state government that's more
responsive to our locals and their needs
uh that's a gentleman further yield yes
ma'am so the efficiency of this new
Charter School compliance agency is
better for us overall so the public
schools doe is not hampered down having
to do both is that correct sir you're
absolutely correct yes
chair recognizes representative for a
question
thank you thank you madam speaker uh
does the gentleman yield yes sir
quick question representative does this
bill in any way weaken local rule by
shifting current responsibilities or
discretion held at the local level to
this newly formed State office no it
essentially shifts uh ftes from doe over
to State Charter School commission to
make them more responsive to our local
authorizers so it no way impacts the the
locals thank you representative thank
you chair recognizes representative
hugely for a question
thank you madam speaker does the
gentleman yield to my seat mate I'll
always yield uh thank you can you talk
about this three percent that if they're
not using administratively it goes back
to the charter school and how much do
you think Charter Schools will realize
as a result of the change it's a great
question so you'll notice in the bill
currently in statute what happens is
Charter Schools pay a three percent
administrative fee to the locals uh the
locals best example I'll give you
imagine if you're in your paycheck
someone took three percent and you had
no detail on what that was spent on what
it's currently supposed to be spent on
is Administrative Services supporting
the local charter school this bill
provides when that three percent is
taken out to then have the locals
provide detail on what exactly that
three percent was spent on any unspent
portion will be returned to the Charter
School
chair recognizes representative Williams
from the 37th for a question
Madam speaker
will the gentleman yield yes ma'am so
the city of Marietta our whole school
system is a charter school system so
I've heard you answer questions but
could you walk me through how this is
going to change
the operation and funding of city of
Marietta schools
so I don't believe the bill addresses
charter school systems this is strictly
Charter Schools uh so and again no
change in operations or funding it
essentially it provides a resource that
was formally housed in doe now housed up
in the state Charter School commission
uh to provide further support for your
local Charter Schools
um Matt follow-up question
stage a question
um do you have the endorsement of the
state school superintendent for this
bill
we have worked with uh doe and a number
of state agencies and local school
boards on this bill
so
um does the they have does he does the
state superintendent endorse this bill
they have not uh
formulator given us an opinion one way
or the other okay thank you
chair recognizes representative Clark of
the 108th for a question
thank you madam speaker does a gentleman
yield yes ma'am can you uh talk a little
bit more about what's happening in lines
197 through 203 specifically when it
comes to requiring that the charter
schools be funded but also allowing
those charter schools to exceed their
enrollment caps
yeah so currently
what takes place at a charter school is
that they're able to
they have a charter school contract
which stipulates how many students are
able to to Service uh this bill allows
for a very small overage if they are
over they do not receive any additional
funding for that overage uh and it's a
very small percent we're talking about
on average probably three to five
students so a typical School estimate We
Believe will have X number uh obviously
with with any business of what we do we
try to get exact but uh you're always
going to be off by maybe one or two
students and that's what this bill
provides for does the gentleman further
yield yes ma'am so you say it doesn't
require but it says that the local board
shall provide the funding and that they
shall not be deemed to have exceeded the
enrollment cap so wouldn't that mean
they shall fund the extra
no there's no additional funding for the
extra kids that they go over uh all
those terms are stipulated in their
Charter School contract thank you
chair recognizes representative Campbell
for a question to your left
thank you madam speaker does the
gentleman yield yes ma'am a bit of a
follow-up question but I'm curious to
know uh did you in the work and
organizing of this meet and confer with
the Georgia School Board Association and
do they support this bill
yes met with them again all those
organizations uh
I don't want to speak out of turn
neither one of them have come out
negatively or in favor but all of them
had input into the language of this bill
chair recognizes representative Carter
for a question
thank you madam speaker does the
gentleman yield yes ma'am there she is
thank you on line 210 to 2 14 and this
was one of the issues that the
department the doe brought up that in
creating a state school commission the
Personnel for that commission will now
be assigned under the school board the
state school board versus the doe can
you help us understand how that's going
to functionally work and
um what really is changing because if
you're creating the uh the office of
flexibility you're creating this
commission it's supposed to help the
charter schools for the locals but there
is a parameter in which that that will
that is something different there's
something other than just Personnel that
changed out of this purse why isn't it
under the school superintendent versus
the doe and what really is happening in
this building why is there a change
great question so uh if I could help you
all visualize kind of an org chart right
here so uh right over here you have the
doe which then it reports up through the
State Board of Education we are taking
administrative staff from doe shifting
them over to the state Charter School
commission which is administratively
attached to the State Board of Education
so if you all can kind of visualize two
boxes two lines up to State Board of
Education shifting administrative staff
from one to the other to better be
responsive to our local governments
and there are no more questions great
thank you madam chair with that I would
ask for your favorable consideration
is there any objection to the previous
question being ordered the chair here is
none the previous question is ordered is
there any objection to adopting the
committee substitute the chair here is
none the committee substitute is adopted

House Bill 336 by representative cops
the 28 to be titled back to amend coat
Section 8 2 23 the official code of
Georgia annotated related to Amendment
and revision of codes generally
so to prohibit the Georgia state minimum
standard codes for prohibiting the use
of certain refrigerants this bill ever
improved committee on natural resources
and environment that committee
recommends that this bill do pass
is chair recognizes representative Cox
to present the bill
thank you madam speaker
this bill's
basically this way
if you enjoy air conditioning
and the benefits of air conditioning
then you need to vote Yes if you do know
then vote no
[Laughter]
in a nutshell the current code in the
state of Georgia reads as such that
new approved refrigerant by the EPA is
technically not approved in the state of
Georgia so on any new construction
whether a home or commercial real estate
this product would not be available to
be installed so we want to make sure
that that's okay with that being said we
also wanted to protect the elderly
um
any one of us that has current HVAC
equipment so that we're not having to
replace everything we want to be able to
use the existing equipment with
mechanical contractors existing
refrigerant to make sure that we can
maintain without having spending New
Capital costs
that is the essence of the bill
I yield for questions
chair recognizes representative Maynor
for a question
thank you madam speaker does the
gentleman yield I do will this bill help
us in this body since it is freezing in
here right now
the current dilemma within the body is
all the bodies aren't in here so that
means a lot of the hot air is still
outside
chair recognizes representative widower
for a question
gentlemen yield I do
would you say that uh during the
Committee hearing
that it actually would have been faster
for you just to have read every word of
the bill to us
that is correct
thank you I appreciate the shortened
presentation thank you chair recognizes
representative Evans for a question
thank you madam speaker does the
gentleman yield I do yes so if we don't
pass this bill
what are the repercussions for people
who own existing air conditioning
systems and
do they have to buy the new refrigerant
or would they have to buy new equipment
that uses the new refrigerant what what
are the repercussions if we don't pass
this bill well it's two pieces to that
so one as long as the current
refrigerants available which it it will
be there's a transition time frame that
this will occur so there's R22 or r410
currently that's used so if the entire
piece of equipment goes out it will need
to be replaced and if that is not
available by manufacturers then you will
um
we'll call it Dippity Doo
and that is when you wake up in the
morning
and you go
and you look down and there's
well never mind it has to do with never
mind forgive me go ahead
chair recognizes representative Bentley
for a question
to your left
thank you madam chair does the gentleman
yield
where are we yes I do
serious question
um I'm in the is it not true that I'm in
the process of purchasing a new cooler
for my business
yes okay if you say so
yes that is true so can you explain to
me exactly how this bill is going to
impact my plans to purchase a new cooler
for my business
so it's based on refrigerant what
refrigerant you have in the existing or
the new cooler there is a new
requirement for refrigerant on future
manufactured product
so as long as this does not go bad with
the old refrigerant then you'll be fine
but moving forward if something were to
go wrong then you would need to replace
the equipment with new HVAC or a new
refrigerant
but if I go if is it not further true
that if I purchase my new cooler now
that I won't I'll be good with your bill
I mean it won't be any issues you will
be fine okay which is important in your
industry yes it is very important for my
industry thank you
chair recognizes uh the next uh question
but we'll also note there are 15 bills
left on the calendar uh chair recognizes

more children
ages one to four die from drowning every
year than any other cause of death
and for children ages 5 to 14 drowning
is the second leading cause of death
as a father of three children learning
these statistics weighed heavily on my
heart as drowning can be preventable
with the right education
this is what house bill 402 seeks to
accomplish

May McGovern

House Bill 338 by representative Erwin
of the 32nd to be entitled act to amend
article 6 of chapter 2 Title 20 the
official go to George Ann say to the
Quality basic education act so as to
provide for the inclusion of methods for
the promotion of the safe and
appropriate use of technology and
responsible digital citizenship
as bill ever for the committee on
education that committee recommends that
this bill do pass
by committee substitute
chair recognizes representative Irwin to
present the bill
thank you madam speaker
colleagues I bring before you House Bill
338 which is the student technology
protection act that this act provides
methods of promoting the safe and
appropriate use of technology and
responsible digital citizenship
so it is filtering of obscene material
from state-owned devices we passed this
bill last year overwhelmingly out of
this house and got it over to the Senate
what we are attempting to do here is to
um make sure that that Predators aren't
able to get on the devices that we are
handing our children as well as
inappropriate or not grade appropriate
material is not able to be accessed
through the devices that our children
carry home with them covid really spiked
this up as you could imagine we gave
many more devices for children to carry
home to use to learn from
the there is a simple law out there
which is the federal act that has set
standards for uh filtering
um what we try what we're supposed to do
to keep that inappropriate material
um all fire devices what we have done
here is we have measured those
um they had not been updated the sipa
law since 2011.
so there's a need in the state of
Georgia to make sure that we not only
let a sipa law from 2011 govern the
protection of our children but also the
fact that Georgia needs to be protecting
our children so with that Madam speaker
I will yield for questions
chair recognizes representative
inulowitz for a question to your left
thank you to the gentleman yield yes I
do is it not true that children will
have access to these kinds of very
disturbing materials whether or not
they're on a school computer
or device but but if they have their own
device that the answer that is correct
their own device but not a state held
device does the gentleman further yield
I do is it not also true that because of
that because these devices are really
kind of ubiquitous regardless of whether
or not your child has access to a device
through school or through home it's very
important for parents to have these
conversations with their children to
prepare them for things they might see
and to explain what these things are and
why it's and that it's important for
parents to understand why they need to
have these conversations earlier than
they probably think they need to I will
agree that parents definitely need to be
having conversations with their children
on what's right and what's wrong thank
you
chair recognizes representative Barnes
for a question
thank you chair lady does the gentleman
yield yes ma'am I do thank you is it
will this bill also
block them from being able to access
these sites from different uh devices
like will it block the Wi-Fi so if they
use their personal device in the school
well the Wi-Fi be able to block them
from accessing these sites let me see if
I understand the question there are
filters that there are servers that have
filters on them at the state facilities
currently today and they will block uh
inappropriate or not grade appropriate
at school but also the devices that they
carry home such as hot spots they need
those same filters on those hot spots
may I further
yield does a gentleman further yield I
do thank you
so when they're at home and they have
the school issued device they will not
be allowed to access these sites at home
as well if it's a hot spot it is
filtered and they would not be able to
that does not stop them to be on their
own uh internet their own personally
paid devices it would only be these
state-owned devices if they are trying
to access through it thank you yes ma'am
chair recognizes representative awe for
question
thank you does the gentleman yield well
if I can find you I'm here I'm here
there we go two years representative I'm
sure this is a question regarding the
definition of obscene materials if you
refer to your copy of the bill lines 89
through 91
how that reads is that obscene materials
is defined as quote predominantly
appeals to the period interest that is a
shameful or morbid interest in nudity
sex or excretion so I'm asking this
looking through the lens of someone
who's watching some fairly alarming
bills who uh that are passing through
the Senate side that look to legislate
the upbringing and education of our
lgbtq youth so I'm aware that some of
the folks bringing some of the
anti-lgbtq bills might in fact look at
some of the literature or medical
information or social support for these
students as quote shameful or as quote
morbid interest in nudity that type of
thing so can you can you give me any
assurances that this bill excludes
that type of literature or information
or online social support for these
students or would such materials be in
fact deemed obscene under this bill
representative these definitions and the
definition obscenity came straight out
of the code section in the law books and
that's what is put in here
in this bill so can you give me any
assurance that this does not preclude
children who might have only one device
as issued through the school from
accessing
accurate medical information or social
support through these devices this does
not preclude that we talk about this
it's grade appropriate so it would be
different for a 11th grader or an eighth
grader versus a first grader to access
material through here so we try to uh in
everything we do in schools we try to
make it great appropriate the same thing
can be said for surgeries and some uh
videos on surgeries whether that's a
grade appropriate or not and a senior
would be allowed to access that
information if it was appropriate say
for a med student that wants to be
pre-med in college versus a second
grader so this would attempt to be great
appropriate material if it's great
appropriate for a senior then it would
not filter that out certainly I think
there's just some subjectivity in that
thank you for answering my questions yes
there are no more questions
we would ask your favorable
consideration for this bill to get it
moving again this year and also uh we we
will then yield the will
that gentleman has yielded the well is
there any objection to the previous
question being ordered the chair here is
nine the previous question is ordered is

foreign
to be entitled an act to amend part 7 on
article 7 chapter 3 Title 20 the
official code of Georgia annotated
relating hope scholarships and grants
still to provide for Hope inclusive
post-secondary education grants this
bill lever referred to the committee on
higher education that committee
recommends that this bill do pass by
committee substitute
chair recognizes representative Gaines
for uh to present the bill
thank you madam speaker I know we are
late in the afternoon so I'll try to be
brief but this bill is one I'm really
excited about
that creates grant opportunities for
students who enroll in what are called
inclusive post-secondary education
programs which are programs at
universities and colleges throughout
Georgia that allow students with
intellectual disabilities the
opportunity to attend college when I was
at UGA I actually had the opportunity to
help start a program the program at UGA
Destination Dogs it's a program that
started Clemson Clemson life and there's
these programs all across the state
they're Albany Tech Columbus State
throughout Georgia Georgia Tech Georgia
Southern there's several great programs
throughout the state we have about 150
of these students Statewide again
students with intellectual disabilities
a great opportunity so this would create
a grant opportunity to help these
students to pay their tuition costs
because currently they're not eligible
for hope this is not within the Hope
Scholarship but will be a separate grant
that we would would be subject to
appropriations of the general assembly
and Madam speaker I'll be happy to
answer any questions if there are any
chair recognizes representative Hilton
for question I think imagine the
gentleman yield I will is it not true

many of our students who have the
ability to be contributors to this state
to go to college and get assistance that
they need to make that happen for them
yeah these programs very successful in
moving students from education to
employment have shown tremendous success
I believe at Georgia Tech their program
has almost a 90 employment rate for the
students who go through these programs
one more question sure do you yield is
it not true that we have a young man
that is around this wonderful place
named Charlie that has been very helpful

great job helping get this bill over the

surface mining uh that section of the
the fines had not been adjusted in many
years when it comes to somebody if they
willfully misrepresent any fact in any
matter or part or willfully gifts false
information in any application or report
required by the epd the maximum fine
that they could they could charge was a
thousand dollars so what we're doing in
this build is Raising that up to ten
thousand dollars per day and each day
counts as a separate occurrence so it
can compound daily basically so anyway
that's all we're doing in the bill just
raising the maximum amount they are
allowed to to charge for someone that
willfully violates say this section so
that's all the bill does and I'd ask for
your favorable consideration

chair lady Ballinger is recognized to

thank you Mr Speaker okay ladies and
gentlemen this is the last one I promise
um House Bill 509 is adds an act of
Family Violence to the burglary statute
right now the burglary statute is
narrowly curtailed to theft or a felony
and it adds an act of Family Violence it
only appeals it only a
after number three you're a bit tired
um it only includes offenses between
current and former spouses intimate and
former romantic Partners or family
members so we're really trying to get at
the heart of the intimate partner
violence
um that's the bill I'll be happy to
answer any questions
you have a question thank you to your

Violence is burglary is that how I'm
reading it or it will be covered under
the burglary statue right now somebody
kicks in your door and steals your
toaster and walks out they're guilty of
burglary right now if an intimate
partner kicks in the door beats the crap
out of their former intimate partner
they're guilty of two crimes they're
guilty of battery and they're guilty of
Criminal Trespass two misdemeanors this
would Elevate that offense to the level
of a felony punishable by one to twenty

code of George annotated relating the

this bill I referred to the committee on
technology and infrastructure Innovation
that committee recommends that this bill
do pass by committee substitute
they're representing from Jasper George
aren't you from Jasper represent uh
chairman excuse me Rick Jaspers will
present the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
um
house bill 406.
is the work of The Joint Commission on
the electrification of Transportation
I was very honored
to have the opportunity to work on this
game-changing issue in the state
Senator Gooch and I co-chaired a joint
study committee this year
had some great committee members
chairman Powell
chairman Parsons chairman Corbett we
added a couple of people representative
Brad Thomas and representative Spencer
Frye
to help us we created a 700 page
document they'll be glad to send you
because the the issue is Giant and and
wide-ranging you know I have to
recognize Catherine Russell who was in
the Senate research office at the time
now works the department of AG for
really putting that together and from
house budget and research Abby day
you know due to the Biden
administration's focus on electric
vehicles
manufacturers have invested
in electric vehicles in a great way
you'll look at our state you look at the
announcements by the governor as it
relates to electric vehicles you know
we're the leader
and the federal funding
of the Navy plan which is the national
electric vehicle infrastructure plan
will put Chargers across this state in a
great way
Georgia itself will receive 125 million
dollars over the next five years 25
million dollars this year
and for for plan year one which has been
approved by usdot and is certainly
underway right now
so knowing all this was at our doorstep
that's what we had this meeting to act
you know so our goal is to ensure that
Georgia roads and bridges were
adequately funded
and that meant the collection of excise
tax on the sale of electricity for fuel
just like gasoline is right now
this is Cutting Edge you know as we
worked on this you know we are the
leaders as we generally are on
Transportation issues in America
it's built us three things
it allows for the retail sale of
electricity
by others than Georgia power or their
emcs
it creates a regulatory framework for
electric vehicle chargers for safety
accuracy and the location of them to
make sure that we
get our excise tax dollars that's my
number one goal
and then we also create the excise tax
on electricity
at 16 Pages you have to thank Jenna
doley in legislative Council and uh it's
also Madison in my office who's dealt
with the incessant number of people in
my office to work on this bill because
this touches just about everybody across
the state you look at part one page two
probably the most important part of the
bill because this language allows the
owners of electric vehicle charging
equipment to sell electricity by the
kilowatt hour
for the sole purpose of charging an
electric vehicle
this language represents a very
carefully crafted compromise between all
parties that were negotiated last year
on chairman Powell's bill
and this also reflects the findings of
the commission on the electric case of
Transportation I certainly want to thank
chairman Powell and chairman Parsons for
working on this agreement
part two page three all the way through
lines 222
is original gasoline code
but so what we did is we took how we
regulate fuels today how it's sold
stored everything
and carefully worded it legislative
Council make it fit the use of
electricity
on Section 3 page 10 is the tax
regulations part of it worked very
carefully with the Department of Revenue
on this section to make sure we
accurately
captured energy used in transportation
and electricity compressed air
liquefied natural gas and even the
future looking hydrogen
and section four are the effective dates
and if you look they're out their ways
because we've got to give an opportunity
for the target of act to scale up for
Revenue to scale up and for the charging
station providers to make sure that they
can do what we're going to ask them to
do
Mr Speaker I appreciate the opportunity
to work on work on this bill and I'll be
glad to answer any questions
well I got a second you got something on
your desk
from the Georgia Georgia Chamber but I
want to put a shout out to the Georgia
Transportation Alliance if you haven't
worked when you will in the future work
with Seth Milliken and his group they
are great advocates for transportation
all across our state and I think you
will appreciate getting to know them and
the work that they do
gentlemen yield absolutely yes sir
represent the representative Jasmine
Clark to your left has a question thank
you Mr Speaker does the gentleman yield
yes ma'am um first thank you for this
bill I I just am curious because I know
sometimes when I go to Target or when I
go to certain places there are already
electric vehicle charging stations how
are they currently operating how are
they charging people or are they free
how does this work there are both ma'am
some are free the the business is
providing them free some of you buy it
by time
20 30 40 minute increments this changes
it we want them all to be sold as power
and taxes power thank you yes ma'am
gentlemen yield yes sir let's see
German Meeks over to your right has a
question
thank you Mr Speaker just gentleman you
yes sir is it not true that electric
semis will weigh approximately 15 000
more pounds than what current semis
weigh today
absolutely it's gentleman for the year
yes sir does that not me or is it not
true that the drivers and the companies
will either have to reduce their payload
by 15 000 or weight limits will have to
be addressed
hey
the gentleman is absolutely correct and
um
that's why you know Karen Meeks we added
hydrogen because hydrogen will probably
be the fuel of choice for heavy
equipment and tractor moving
representative Tran is recognized for a
question
thank you Mr Speaker that's the chairman
yield yes sir
is it true that this does not apply
there will not be a tax on vehicles
charged at home oh absolutely thank you
for pointing that out you know currently
a vehicle is charged at home is uh pays
a fee it's a 210 dollars and a few cents
per year so we're not touching that
they'll be able to still charge at home
and take advantage of opportunities that
some emcs in Georgia Power May provide
for charging in the midnight
thank you sir yes sir
the gentleman you owe for two more
questions absolutely let's see
representative Frye is recognized for
our question
this is Chairman yield absolutely thank
you Mr chair isn't it true that I'm
honored to have served with you on that
committee on such an important measure
to advance his State into what I
consider energy Independence which also
equals economic independence from
foreign bodies who might manipulate our
fuel prices absolutely you're correct
and I appreciate your input all the way
through this
one more yes sir
representative Donahue of the 31st is
recognized for a question there's a
gentleman my friend Neil yes sir thank
you let me ask you the question here
when you go to Kroger and they're not
charging you the ones that are going to
charge you like a meter base do you know
what the charge roughly is or did they
set their own charge they set their own
charge represented you know they're it's
a free market you know some are some are
going to charge whatever they choose to
thank you you bet
that's the last of the questions yes
that's your last question about fuel
stay there just for a moment yes sir
let me make two points
maybe three
just for planning purposes as y'all I
know y'all are sending text messages out
we're going to finish this bill and
we're not going to take up any more
bills today we'll complete our business
but let me tell y'all something I think
most of y'all know this
chairman Jaspers has spent Untold hours
working on these issues and there's some
other folks are going to speak here in
just a moment but chairman jasters
Jasper as I can tell you we're indebted
to you I don't know if your bill is real
fast or not but we're indebted to you to
uh for the work you've done here so we
appreciate you and um thanks for your
presentation
[Applause]
and Mr chairman appropriately today is
proclaimed by the governor as rivian day
in Georgia what
well thank you Mr chairman the gentleman
yields well
chairman Parsons is recognized to speak
to the bill
chairman Parsons has also been very
involved and spent many Untold hours as
well thank you chairman Parsons
thank you speaker Burns
I'm just going to be very brief I know
we uh we're up against the clock anyway
but I did just a couple of things first
of all I want to ask everyone to vote
for this bill it's a good bill
and I want to thank chairman Jaspers for
his hard work on the bill and also his
hard work as a co-chairman of that uh
committee or commission we we had over
the interim a lot of times spent in that
and a lot of hard work and I appreciate
it it's a complex issue and uh
we've done a really good job coming to
some answers there's a lot other things
that have to be answered but I think at
where it's at right now he's I mean we
have some good good policy here to look
at and consider and and vote
affirmatively on
uh I want to uh I just feel like I would
be remiss actually
if I didn't mention the the committee
that I chair the eut energy utilities
and Telecommunications committee
uh
and they worked hard on this issue last
year we had chairman Powell's Bill last
year that I think actually the one
section of this bill came primarily from
that from that bill
that we had last year as far as selling
the retail sale of electricity by the
kilowatt hour and there are some other
issues in that too that I think are
going to be looked at and hopefully
there's some some communication some
conversation about that right now I'd
also like to mention chairman chokos I
don't know if he's back there or not
chairman showcas had a bill on
there he is he had a bill on the same
issue last year and he put in a lot of
work on it and he had a bill also and
this the same issue as far as the retail
sale of electricity by the kilowatt hour
uh that uh he put in work on that and
basically came up with the same the same
language so I want to thank him for that
and uh with that I would just say that
we were our committee did some hard work
on that listening to a lot I mean hours
and hours and hours of testimony on this
last year and as I mentioned before uh
you know I've
I have a background my background's in
telecommunications and signal and I
spent about 20 years in the reserves uh
as a NCO non-commissioned officer as a
non-commissioned officer one thing you
do is you take care you have to take
care of the people that that you work
with that's just part of being an NCO
and that's one reason I wanted to
definitely mention the folks on that
committee last year because they they
did a really good job putting in a lot
of work and last thing is this is a good
bill and I think chairman Jasper Ford
and I ask you to vote for it thank you I
yield well
gentleman shielded the well
and thank you for your work on this on
this issue Sharon Parsons you've done
you've spent many hours as well chairman
Allen Powell who also was involved in
spending a lot of hours and and making
sure this bill did exactly what we
needed to do German Powell recognized to
speak to the Bill thank you Mr Speaker
not a whole lot that I can add to what
uh chairman Jasper's has said every day
something I would commit this bill to
you you know this is groundbreaking
last year I got involved and I'd go with
I'd be remiss if I didn't say thanks to
a lot of folks chairman Parsons and his
committee his vice chairman
representative gullet and so many of his
members you know we got into the mix on
this last year that we knew that this
was coming in as elono the uh the powers
that be in the federal government and
the public policies of this country are
changing
and I realized at that point we had such
an intricate part in uh that we're going
there's going to be at stake we had uh
the MC's we had Georgia power and we
know we all understand business in this
state we understand it's about winners
and losers and all of these different
entities they were salivating at the
lips who was going to try to get a
monopoly as best they could or get over
on the other one and so it's picking
winners and losers
thanks to
chairman Parson and his committee
members it was bipartisan about some of
the things that we talked about was to
prohibit monopolies to do things like
the sale of Power by the KW
because you're fixing to see a change of
this country
as this idea about electric vehicles
moves forward and I had said last year I
had some concerns being an old
convenience store guy in our earlier
life I see the I see things that are
going to change with this EV but EV is
not going to be the final solution it's
only going to be part of the part of the
solution to our energy problems in the
future I personally think that it's
going to be minor I think right now that
everything that we've seen is uh with
all the federal grants and all the money
and all the people who want to get into
the charging business and I suspect at
some point you're going to be riding
down the highway the way I have in my
past and you're going to see these
popsicle sticks spread across the
Horizon of this great state and Country
and it's going to be EV charges that are
obsolete because I have feel full faith
in the research and development of a lot
of companies whether it's hydrogen or
compressed this or compress that or
propane and you know you're going to see
other forms of energy that are going to
uh that are going to be powering this
nation but you can rest assured on one
thing
that it's going to change the makeup
a lot of those stores that rely on
gasoline products today they're gonna a
lot of them are gonna have to retool
they're going to have to figure out
other sources of revenue they're going
to have to figure out food service
they're going to figure out shopping or
whatever because the American public is
not in our nature to go and sit on our
fannies for 30 minutes while you get a
charge to get on down the road another
150 miles
that's just not the nature of this
country I just don't believe it will be
in the future
but that being said I want to commend
and we've all given him a round of
applause and I think that's very fitting
because he put in a yeoman's job on this
committee this year we traveled around
bits and parts of the state and we did
all this stuff but the openness of the
mind and he kept focused on
the bottom line to this and the bottom
line was how do we how do we change the
formulary for motor fuel tax to kilowatt
hours
I'm not sure it's all going to work but
I know it's a step forward in this
pretty revolutionary and where we're
going and I think he needs to be given
all full credit for that and all the
members of the committee that weighed in
on this so ladies and gentlemen of the
house I would certainly commend you to
vote for this bill
if nothing else that board should
probably be the greenest board that I've
seen since this morning I laughed to
myself I told Donna the door keeper I
looked up at the board this morning and
I saw
the greenest board I'd ever seen this
time
I mean hardly nobody was missing on
whatever that issue was but that's what
this bill is this is a bill and step in
the right direction it's built to get us
prepared for the future and I would
certainly recommend you vote for this
Bill thank you
the gentleman has yielded the well
representing Brad Thomas is recognized
to speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker I'll make sure to
keep this short I was proud to serve on
the Joint Committee for electrification
transportation I actually didn't make
the first cut of the committee my fine
chairman over here actually helped me
get onto the committee and I'll I'll be
very I'm very grateful for that and I
rise in support of HB 406 this bill it
codifies sound and practical policies
for fuels of Tomorrow specifically
electricity hydrogen and some other
alternative fuels you know it's our it's
our responsibility to provide an economy
that allows for all fuel sources to be
made available and let the consumer
decide what's best for them
uh I I actually drive a four-wheel drive
truck every day
um I got a 68 Camaro I take out on the
weekends when when it's sunny
and uh I'm not what the EV industry
would identify as like a likely customer
but my job isn't here to protect my fuel
source my job here is to allow for the
free market system to operate and allow
for people to have the choice of fuel
and this bill does that
uh one thing people don't realize is
electric cars can be powered not only by
the power stored in their battery but
through hydrogen via hydrogen fuel cell
technology
this bill addresses fuel diversity and
lays ground work for future alternative
fuels
I believe our roads are for the use of
everyone
but I also believe that everyone should
pay their fair share this bill addresses
that
finally I believe that the consumer
should be protected from Bad actors who
may not be providing the charging power
that that they're saying that they're
actually charging this bill addresses
that
so I once again once again commend
chairman Jaspers like I said the one
thing you'll know it says joint
committee that means he had to work with
Senators I feel like he deserves another
whole Applause for that
but otherwise I asked for your favorable
consideration and I yield well

highlight a particular woman from

special that is in the works Mary
Musgrove who is from the Savannah area
was a daughter of an English Trader and
a Native American woman and she
understood many cultures and many
different languages and she became The
Negotiator between English and Native
American communities and was known as
being The Interpreter for James
Oglethorpe she did this throughout her
life and helped negotiate many of the
treaties that made us become the state
of Georgia and so what is happening lady
will suspend thank you
proceed thank you what is happening is
in
2026 we the United States of America
will be 250 years old and in relation to
that situation or that party or that
celebration there are people who would
like to have a statue of a Native
American person on the grounds of the
Capitol and Mary Musgrove is under
consideration so hopefully that will
happen and if you can help with that
they would welcome your help thank you

talk and uh they got ready to leave and
they gave me a little jar of honey
and she told me that the honey was made
at the University of Georgia
veterinarian school and that they a
person at the veterinarian school has
discovered a vaccine for honeybees and
you know all over the world we're having
trouble with honeybees dying and the
vaccine was discovered and made at the
University of Georgia veterinarian
school and she went on to tell me and I
did not know this and
that a company from California has moved
to Athens to produce the vaccine and it
I am just so proud of them and for what
they've done and as a little footnote uh
Tara burkhold is my uh admit uh
budget analyst and she came in to talk
about the budget and so uh I told her
about the the discovery that invited at
the University of Georgia and Tara said

money we just did that
and so uh they are going to be on Good
Morning America and they've had a
