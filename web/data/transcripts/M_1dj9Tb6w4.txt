And before we start, our business, I'm going to ask Senator Burns, Mike Nunder 12 to open
us up here.
Ms Bill joining to raise her, John all the wee bit, we're going to offer.
Thank you.
and you worked with my staff and I'm sure that I forgot to recognize our first staff.
I'm not sure what next week someone might want to take you on the meeting.
to the SCOTS, and Holly, our English Life Council.
Thank you all so much for having us.
And I think we also have one question on one of the nails.
but we have two bills this afternoon and the first one is a hospital 291, which you should be very familiar with.
The second one, it sounds about 144 per year only today.
And we do have some cheap switch hustling.
Anybody wants to test mine?
We can take advantage of it, but we'll say that we have a win this afternoon.
And we have a few committee meetings this afternoon that a lot of people have a long way to drive.
way to drive. So we're not in sunshine tomorrow. We'll be working for both. And so I hope all of you
are just giving me just something everybody can be driving out of here. So with that,
represented Skoggins, you want to tell us why you changed until you know
anyone because we have heard this film last week and I know that you've worked hard on
and get changes. I think, and I really appreciate your hard work.
I appreciate your time.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I remember this mail just.
What it's doing.
We're trying to expand our lives from the matter.
Play a game, make more than a yard in shape.
So that's really.
and this increases by the time that we're adding,
if you're looking at the green and red again,
the transition to the system,
the last of the other January,
we're going to be doing a nurse practitioner
or a medical nurse specialist
that is trained and sentenced to a 10-month-old.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
I have a question about where the compliments are on that source of the nurse, the practitioner
on March 24, that there's practitioners who are a clinical nurse that is specialised
in, so there's the nurse practitioner who has to have a psychiatric and mental health
a
The next question is,
the next question is,
the next question is,
if you have any additional information,
psychiatric,
or mental health,
or education,
outside of what's provided,
and on national program,
you all can read.
Thank you.
So, we're
is
because it seems to me that I'm sitting on the floor.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Um,
this is intended to be a nurse practitioner.
Oh.
Let him pull their specialists into specializes in that area.
Both are under chapter 26 of Title 43.
If you add an accommodate between a practitioner or.
He will have to somehow correct Spring Festival in Episode 4 and 3.
Okay?
So, and I think that was intentionally written, written, written, if you know the next big marriage
and Bayleigh Barebeach ends up on his extra visual transplant.
There was no tension on his additional weapon.
He's very sad to hear that, that, there's might change, actually change.
We can certainly let the council sign this is what we need to do there, but we follow
our questions and we can be thinking about that for answering Senator Tharn's question.
This is reminding him not to share your questions, but I'm committing now.
We're talking about comments that we say about chairs for down the hour, but when the comments go,
that's a good day. I just want to sign the author and those who worked all this, I think it
Much adopt our entire
and
is
Um, or as a draper I think that,
but, because it wasn't done
of the possession assistant, or excuse me, the nurse practitioner, or the nurse specialist,
and for consistency and the way the code is spreading the marriage, family, therapists, or confessional counts there.
I can't agree, the Senator estimates, as it's about to tell the truth.
It sounds terrible, I'm sure, actually.
It's a little difficult to tell the truth.
It's about to tell the truth.
It's about to tell the truth.
It's about to tell the truth.
It's about to tell the truth.
It's about to tell the truth.
So any other questions?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's.
It's.
It's.
It's.
Are you Mike?
Yes.
Did you have another.
I was going to ask to make a motion at the appropriate time, but I think Senator Jackson might
have a question. I'll ask it. Social work or licensed social worker does not have a title attached.
I know that was in the original bill or original law. Do we know whether there should be some kind
kind of chapter and title attached to that.
Students said we're aligning to talking to you.
27.
The last is clinical. So yeah, so all the, all the.
All the.
Yeah, so we're not adding that. It's already there.
Okay.
Okay.
We do have some people signed up to testify,
so let's go ahead and give them an opportunity.
First, Aubrey, Elaine.
Thank you, Chair and members of the Midi Aubrey
behind the last professional council
of the Association and the Advanced Practice Nurse
is all wave unless there's questions.
Be happy to answer any questions
and I wrote the original bill years and years ago.
Just for the record for me, please you support the bill.
We support the subject.
Thank you. That's what I needed to hear.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay, Angie Smith.
Thank you Madam Chairwoman.
I am the current chair of the license professional counselor,
social worker, and marriage and family therapist composite board.
So I'm here to answer any questions that you may have.
From a licensing standpoint or a training education standpoint.
I'm not sitting on their lines.
Oh, I'll wait.
Senator Jack wants to ask you a question.
Yes, just from a, thank you, Madam Chair.
From a training standpoint,
are these folks that you represent?
Do you feel like they are trained in recognizing these types of competencies,
just by nature of their schooling and training already?
Is that inclusive?
Yes, ma'am.
I do believe that.
Yes, ma'am, I do believe that the clinicians that are licensed by our board are competent to perform these evaluations.
We are already doing modified versions of this when we assess for lethality, we assess for risk.
So I believe that our clinicians are trained and prepared to perform these evaluations. Great. Thank you.
Thank you. Robin, you already spoke the driven thing
else to add. Okay. Elizabeth Appley?
Yes, Madam Chair, I represent the Georgia Association for
Mountain Family Tribune to support the bill and thank the
author and appreciate it working with us on the sub. I
have Dr. Steve Livingston, a former board chair for the
composite board available and Dan Upshaw and Brady
available to answer your questions. Thank you. Dr. Livingston, can you hear us?
Yep, I can hear you. Thank you for having me on virtual. I'm receiving an infusion as we speak.
so please. Okay, can you hear us? Yes, yes. Did you have anything you want to add? I think you've
been on there the whole time, so you've heard the conversation. Yeah, I just, you know, I agree with
all the testimony. I'm the legislative chair of the Georgia Association for Marriage and Family
therapy and we support 291 this revision of it. And do believe that licensed
marriage and family therapists, professional counselors as well as
social workers are all qualified to do this. I was chair of the board for
four years and a program director for Mercy University's marriage and
family therapy program in the school of medicine. And I know that the
training that marriage and family therapists receive is you know would
qualify them to do these kinds of evaluations.
All three of us, professional counselor,
social workers, and MFTs are credentialed
to diagnosis and treat mental illness.
We all treat individuals, couples, and families.
Sometimes marriage and family therapists
get the label of just being marriage counselors,
but we've been for 25 plus years in Georgia,
treating individuals, couples, and families
dealing with a variety of issues
and doing, you know, similar kinds of things.
And all three disciplines on this board
all are qualified to do this kind of evaluation.
Thank you.
Any questions from the committee?
Okay, that's everyone we had signed up to testify.
And if there are no further questions,
I'll entertain a motion.
I move that we do pass.
Okay, second by Senator Jackson, further discussion.
Okay, all in favor raise your hand. Any opposed?
Okay, thank you.
Bill passes. Who's carrying this for you?
Okay. Thank you.
Okay, next we have House Bill 144, this is hearing only we're not voting on this bill today. Representative Lewis Ward, are you ready?
I'm heading.
Welcome to the Senate. Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
What's that?
I heard that.
This is the first time you've been before our committee is this isn't your first bill is it it is. Ah, okay. Thanks for sharing that
Okay, go right ahead the floor that the new madam chair and members of the committee. I bring to you House Bill 144 LC number
48
0937 s
This is a constituency bill
I'm about a year and a half ago constituent came to me
Our brother was sick and his wife has stopped the family from allowing him to communicate with the family.
He eventually passed away on December 24th of last year and that's where we get the name the George Burgess Act from his name and honor for brother.
When we took a look at the current code, the code does exist for a war to communicate freely
with anyone other than the guardian. But what this bill does, it just adds a little bit more
of into the current code. And we did have some conversations with DHHS. They thought that there
there may be some conflict with the bill,
with the current code,
and also with the representatives for the probate judges
we had a meeting with them.
And they provided us with code
that they would prefer to see in the bill,
and that's what we did the substitute
because we put in their code in the bill.
We worked with legislative counsel,
and we also believed that there's no conflicts
with the current code.
So section one, what it basically does,
it just indicates some ways that the ward
can communicate with someone other than a guardian.
And then section two is part D, line seven, things are 25,
is the code that the pro-bate representatives
ask us to include.
And really that's the bill.
Questions from the committee?
Okay, we have one person signed up
to testify Judge Keith Wood.
Come on up.
You can just scoot over and let him get to the mic,
if you would.
Good afternoon.
Members of the committee,
I wanna first thank you for the opportunity
to be here to discuss this bill.
And I want to start out by saying that.
Can you tell us where you're from?
Sure, absolutely.
I am from a lovely Cherokee County
Georgia on the probate court judge.
I am, again, appreciative of Representative Lewis Ward
for putting forth legislation and having
a concern for the adult ward.
Certainly, that's a concern as a probate judge.
We have as well.
And when looking at a bill like this,
It's not that we have an issue with the idea
that we want to have the tools
to deal with situations such as this,
it's just that we already have those tools.
The language, even the substitute language,
doesn't really add anything to something
that we already have the ability to do.
When you look at the statute,
as it is currently structured, you know,
you have 29, 420, which sets out these rights
that award has, including the right to communicate
with people freely.
Then you have the code section 29, 420,
which says that the court and situations
were award is denied some right.
The court has the ability to investigate
the circumstances of that award
and determine if something needs to happen.
And then if you, when you look at code section 29452,
it kind of sets out things that the court can do
if we find cause.
Those include revoking or suspending guardians letters
requiring additional security
if they're required to be bonded.
Reducer deny compensation.
Impose any other sanctions that we deem appropriate.
Issue, and this is the one I always like,
issue any other order as in the court's judgment
is appropriate under the circumstances of the case.
So we have a really fairly broad ability
to deal with situations such as this.
Quite honestly, as a probate judge,
if I have circumstances,
and I've had these circumstances before,
we believe that award has been prohibited
from communicating with others.
Quite honestly,
I'm gonna go to removing a guardian
before I do anything else.
I'm not looking to find them.
I'm not looking to, you know, slap them on the risk.
I'm looking to remove them,
because that's a serious problem.
If, or in the alternative,
the court has the authority to set out things
like visitation plans and things of that nature
that can more directly address that problem.
It is not that I have an issue
with what this legislation attempts to do.
It's just, I think it's something
that we really already have the authority to do.
And I don't want to muddy the water of something
that we already have, the authority to do,
that we can do, and that we actually already do do.
And it's, you know, maybe this is a situation
where it's a case where maybe someone didn't realize
that authority was there, but it's there.
Thank you, Judge.
Any questions for Judge Wood?
Mr. Jackson?
Thank you, Madam Chairman, Chairwoman, so to be clear, you're saying that people who
are awards are already supposed to be able to have visitations, telephone calls, emails
and personal mail come to them that that's already existing in code.
Is that what you're telling me?
I guess it really depends on how you want to define the term communication.
I define it fairly broadly.
I mean, if someone tells me,
you know, I'm not allowed to have phone contact with a ward,
I consider that, you know,
that violating the spirit of what that statute provides.
I mean, you can, you can sit there
and divine out what we mean by communication.
And that's fine.
I don't know that it adds or takes away anything.
But yes, I think that the court can already act.
The court already has the authority act
in those circumstances.
So in your expert opinion, if someone were a ward
and they wanted to have regular visitation from someone,
if that were denied to them, you're saying
that they would have calls to come to court already
if they were not allowed visitation with someone else.
Yes, absolutely.
I think that that, and I think what the court
is trying to do in those circumstances again,
every case is going to be different,
but I mean, you're weighing,
You know, you may have a situation where you have a ward that wants to have a visitation with someone who may have been a predator before.
Obviously, the court is not going to want such a circumstance, but that's what the court's there for is to evaluate the circumstances and determine what is appropriate.
But if it's a circumstance where the ward wants to have a visitation with a relative, and that's being denied, that's something the court should be addressing and has to address.
Thank you.
Senator Robertson.
Thank you, thank you, Judge.
Judge, would you say that when you deal with communications
on the vast majority of these,
when you get down into the weeds on a particular case,
wouldn't you say that there's more times
that you're specific in limiting communication
based on some of the things you just said
as far as a predator and predator,
we don't necessarily mean sexual.
We talk about financial predators and others
that attempt to take advantage of these individuals,
but on most of them, when you say communication,
if it even has to be addressed,
it's an extremely broad spectrum
and a lot of times,
and I understand the representatives concerned,
a lot of times that communication is open
and encouraged by the guardian of the individual.
And so if we break it down to say email and all this other kind of stuff what we're really doing is we're taking the cake and just slicing it into pieces that they can already do all that but that where you're more detailed orders come from is when you're having to put prohibitions in there targeting particular individuals whose contact would not be conducive with the with the overall health of the individual trying to protect is that true.
That's true, but I guess the way I look at it,
this bill is attempting to address conduct
by a guardian as opposed to third parties.
So what the focus is is if the guardian
is prohibiting these communications,
not if other people are having these communications,
what the court is trying to address most of the time
is a guardian who is prohibiting communications.
if there is a circumstance where there's a third party trying to have communications with the
ward, this is not appropriate, you know, our expectation is, is the guardian is there to protect
the ward. But in this, I guess in the similar vein, if the ward is allowing that communication,
we need to address that as well. There's no question about that. But I think this bill is more focused
on what is the guardian doing to prohibit these communications as opposed to what other people are
are doing. Final question, Madam Chair. But is there anything in this bill that the court
could not do today? From my point of view, no, I think there was language in there about
finding someone. And I guess my feeling about that is if I think that a case is extreme enough
that I'm finding people I need to be removing people because to me that's that's a fairly significant step.
I'm not sure you're looking at the most recent version of the bill because I think that was
what line is that right and I think it's more discretionary now than it was before.
or a question.
Yeah.
Okay.
Not limited to, right.
Other questions for Judge Wood?
We'll work on those.
Yep.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
So just to, is there anything in this bill
if we were to pass it that you think would undermine
or be harmful?
So I know we've, we've adjust the other side of,
do you think that we need it?
Mm-hmm.
But is there anything about passing this bill
that would actually be hurtful or harmful?
I don't think it to the extent that it does not limit anything that I can do,
you know, I don't have a problem with it in terms of is it going to affect my ability to protect
awards interest? No, I just think that I think that, you know, it's a very well-intentioned
idea. I think that we already just have that authority and you're just adding language to
something that's already there. Thank you. Thank you, Senator Barnes. Thank you, Madam Chair.
This may be a question for the author, but I'll start with the judge. On line 10,
the word communicate freely and privately. Again, is already in code? Is that correct?
On line 10, section 1,
Unicate freely and privately is already in code is that correct correct and so the remainder
of the sentence that the additional language is an attempt. I think it's an attempt to define
what communication means and I can communicate through these types of mechanisms,
visitation, bone calls, emails, and personments. Is that true? So we're trying to
define what free communication is, is that author? Let's first let the representative answer.
So line 11 just gives examples of ways to communicate. But but interestingly enough,
it seems to imply that this is an exhaustive list. So we're not talking about social media or
or any kind of Facebook, Instagram, technology change because it's not email but I can use messaging
or messaging services. My concern is if we codify those things over time, they will become obsolete.
Even if you listen to them all out today, so if I consider and say, I want to add Facebook
messenger, for example, to that. It's not email. Or you know, I'm just saying my concern is not
opposed to it, but is if you specify this, and you don't, I don't see where it says that this is
these are examples. Use the term through. I'll be, I'm just concerned that we would become
I'm absolutely in a matter of years or less.
Thank you for that comment.
I would be willing to include that word examples or for instance,
if legislative council would be grateful to that or it's that.
It's in some way that we can change that.
We have another question. I'm going to wrap.
I said rest rest rest.
if including the wording, including through would be, so that's one word that we would add
to that sentence. Because I can understand why you want to provide examples because
communicating freely and privately would most naturally come across as communication,
whether it's written verbal, visitation is a word that sticks out there because that doesn't come
naturally like the word would be entitled to communicate through visitation. So I do appreciate
the fact that that is there because I don't think that that's a natural example that people would
think about, whereas communicate freely and privately through telephone, email, and personal mail
make sense. So I appreciate the fact that visitation is in there maybe by
including the word including it makes it clear that that we're talking about
examples. Ms. Carter did you have comment on this? The easy fix at this point would
be including but not limited to that would be a legislative proper way to go
with that issue.
Senator Payne, any questions?
Yes.
Thank you, Madam Chairman.
This is even out of that language, including but not limited to.
I mean, that doesn't change the fact that it states communicate freely and privately with persons other than the Guardian.
already. And I mean, we're not really changing anything with this language, because my good friend
down there pointed out that, you know, if you start listing the ways that they can communicate,
you're putting, you're putting that communication that's supposed to be freely and privately in a box.
And when you start putting that communication in a box of what that communication and how it can
You can come and win it, you can come.
Then it's going quickly, not big,
free me and privately anymore.
That's my concern.
Okay, I didn't hear a question there,
but I think there's a fair amount of questions
about the exact wording that's in the bill
and the impact that it would have on with prevent judges do,
which is why we're having hearing only.
But as you know, this is year one of a two year process
And so I'm hopeful that you'll be able to work
with the probate judges and get this language very tight
and bring it back to us.
Great.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
And we're adjourned.
Straight away, sir.
