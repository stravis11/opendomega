But y'all come back a little bit. I recognize the Senator from the 40th to lead us in our pledge and introduce the pastor of the day. Thank you, Mr. President. Please join me in the pledge of allegiance. I pledge allegiance to the flag in the United States and America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, and liberty, and justice for all. And now the Georgia flag. I pledge allegiance to the Georgia flag and for the principle of the richest stands, justice, and moderation. It is my pleasure to introduce the Reverend Elizabeth Mitchell Clement, known also as Reverend Liz. She is my pastor and the designated Senior Minister at Central Congregational United Georgia Christ in Decap County. She and her husband Arthur, who lived in Atlanta since 1981, and raised their two grown sons here. She has no grandchildren yet, but she says she's not allowed to talk about that. She and Arthur reside in the district of my friend and the Senator from the 36th. Although a native of California, Reverend Liz received all her higher education in the south, Tallahdegh, a college in Alabama, Georgia State University, and the Kenner School of Theology at Emory University. Reverend Liz isn't the average pastor. She has a particular call and gift for walking into congregations in transition, often between pastors, helping them rediscover themselves amid difficult change, which is what she's doing, and what she's busy doing in my congregation right now. From the Carter White House to teaching ethics and leading spiritual life at Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts, and now back at home, working to nurture and support the next generation of spiritual leaders, Reverend Liz has a clear commitment to the common good and a healthy civic life, as she says in her purpose statement. I am a woman of a certain age, called to give my gift to create spaces for healing, fullness, and hope, one at a time, fearlessly. Welcome, Reverend Liz. Mr. President, Senator Harold, I am here this morning because I answered a call. First up was the call from Sally Harold, but before that it was a call to serve the church. Later that call became quite specific in the voice of my teenage son, who at a time when he had absolutely no use for his mother or anything she might say, addressed me voluntarily to say, mom. You know what grownups can do for kids? No. You can help us learn to make good choices. He stood up, and just as he walked out of the room, he said, and that's all. As he left, I thought maybe grownups could use that too. But I knew he was right. And that has been my blessing and my challenge every day since, to help others make good choices for themselves and for their neighbors. My suspicion is that every one of you in this August chamber, this morning has also answered a call to serve. Many of you will remember the very moment when you heard it and answered it. That moment in time when you knew that you would give yourself to answering that call, that moment when you took your first steps that would shape the rest of your life. If your experience has been anything like mine, you have often prayed for courage, for strength, for love and support, all of which is required to live in faithful response to a call that comes from beyond you, from beyond yourself, a call to serve a greater good and a hope for future. That is my prayer every day, and that is my prayer for all of us this day. Join me now if you will in a word of prayer. Gracious God, you whom we know and experience by many names, thank you for calling us to serve your goodness begun in creation. Thank you for considering us worthy co-creators with you. Thank you for the ways in which our service furthers the future you dream of for all of creation. Even as we give thanks, there may be days when we wish this responsibility could be assigned to others. We may wish that the responsibilities wouldn't last quite so far into the month of April. We might wish on certain days when that selflessness requires too much of us, it's too heavy a load, and there are days when taking up the dreams of your own heart are just too costly. You know how often we pray for help, to be clear about the ways that honor your confidence in us and the confidence of those we serve. Wherever we serve, help us to honor the realities of lives we cannot know. Feel loss and grief that may not be ours and hold each other in your loving embrace. We thank you above all for walking beside us as we enter these halls for never leaving us and for the strength of your own presence that gives us the faith and courage to answer your call each new day in your own name we pray. Amen. We have our doctor of the day and to introduce our doctor of the day I recognize the center from the 38. The introduce our doctor of the day. Thank you Mr. President. Good morning colleagues and visitors. It is my pleasure to introduce our doctor of the day. I miss my calling because there are a lot of doctors in the district 38. I have been here a few times this week. Dr. D. Graffen Reed is a physician and program director of appointment excellence and exe leery access for Kaiser Permanente of Georgia. She is a specialist in adult medicine where she works closely with her health care team to educate her patients and the community on the things they need to be aware of to prevent disease. She believes that our bodies, minds and relationships all have an effect on our health and encourages our patients to make time to celebrate their lives. Dr. D. is a native of Indiana. She is a hosier and the youngest of 11 children decided in eighth grade that she wanted to be a physician. She graduated from Purdue University with a pharmacy degree then went on to complete her medical degree at Case Western University in Cleveland. Dr. D. I'm from Ohio so we need to make sure we point that out. She joined Kaiser Permanente in 2003 and sees patients in Kaiser Permanente's medical offices throughout Metro Atlanta. She is a resident of Southwest Atlanta and she is very active in the medical association of Georgia as president of the medical institute of excellence in medicine and former task force chairperson. She also serves on the board of the medical association of Atlanta friends I introduce to you Dr. D. Grafen Reed of Kaiser Permanente as our doctor of the day. Good morning. Thank you, Mr. President and thank you, Senator Kim. And thank you to all of you. I'm always honored to be here and I must give thanks to Mag who allows me the opportunity to be here and serve with Ms. Julia down in the medical aid station. She doesn't need me but I'm happy to be there and Mag also allows me to serve on the medical reserve core. I like working at Kaiser because our mission is to make sure that we're improving the health of the communities we serve and looking forward to any opportunities that we have to partner with you as you improve the health of the citizens of Georgia. Happy day number 39. You're almost there. Couple days. Thank you for all the work that you've done. It's April 2nd and the question on everybody's mind is what is causing us to have all this stuffy nose and this itchy. It's the tree pollen. Tree pollen count is high. It'll fluff but it makes for a beautiful spring here in Georgia. So thank you so much for the opportunity to serve you today and good luck with the last couple of days. Senator from 29. Mr. President asked for unanimous consent to excuse the senators from the 20th and the 27th. That objection is from the 20th and 27th arts. Are there any unanimous consent? Does any senator wish to rise on point of personal privilege? Senator from the 14th. What do you think? Thank you Mr. President. Good morning colleagues. I am the senator from the 14th and this is Trump morning news. Not morning news. Your number one leader in Trump news entertainment keeping you apprised of the health of your democracy. Well folks it's been a long and informative legislative session here in the 2nd Trump era and I just have to say we couldn't have done it without viewers like you. This may be our final episode of Trump morning news and what a day to celebrate the final episode other than liberation day. This is right today as announced by President Trump is liberation day liberation from a world without tariffs. Liberation from a world without stagflation. We are going to see a new package of tariffs unveiled counter tariffs at this point. I don't know if it's the reply the response the re-up the insist the disagree but at this point we are looking at a brand new package that promises to be the most beautiful package of tariffs. Standing here right now I can't tell you the contours of all those I can just say that finally finally American greatness will be restored by taxing individual consumers who will carry the past through costs on a range of goods and services by inflaming our relationships with our allies across the world who have settled into historic economic relationships that are disappearing like whips in the air and finally we will be liberated from the America that we once were. Thank you Mr. President and as always colleagues there's nothing you can do about this directly because you're state legislators just a reminder and there's nothing the Republican Party could have done in the last 20 years to prevent this from happening with great respect and gratitude I yield the well. Always an uplift and message from Senator from the 14th. I recognize Senator from the 28th please. Hello good morning thank you Mr. President colleagues I am so excited today to have our Juneteenth Band of stairs and it's the 13th annual parade music festival that's coming up for the 1st of June but being one of the largest and most impactful Juneteenth celebrations in the whole world Juneteenth Atlanta has grown from its humble beginnings to an expansion of the cultural movement that unites communities across the Africa diaspora. So celebrating the 13th annual Juneteenth festival on June 14th and 15th at Peat Mount Park and we have some of the young people that are here today who are going to participate so while our band stand up and everyone who came for Juneteenth and let's give them a warm well they're going to be at the you what do you call a unity plaza in a couple of hours.

Thank you Mars Brown at Alchemy here I know your name and CEO Lauren Angela Molison. Hi Angela God bless you thank you here all for coming and thank you Mr. President and here on the well. Senator from the 56 you be on deck just whenever

Thank you, Mr. President. Senators, I am very excited to welcome in the Senate gallery members from my church. I see our pastor, Tom Davis, up there, as well as some of the leaders and volunteers of the United Methodist Church job networking ministry. It's something that I have been proud to be a part of for over two decades now. This organization, which works with all folks who are looking for employment, has helped over 90,000 people. Has been nationally recognized. A B C with Diane Sawyer, our very own Clark Howard here at WSB. Books have been written about it. The leadership and the effort that has continued to expand. In fact, I remember back about 16 years ago, when it was a smaller group of people used to meet and our small gymnasium. And when the financial markets fell, we walked in one Monday and 400 people had showed up. And we quickly had to move what was a small operation to a massive operation. It's really been an honor to take a very small role, but really under the leadership of two extraordinary people, Catherine Simons and Jay Litten. Who deserve so much credit for helping all those folks out. Each and every person that had lost a job at one point of their life was in a very difficult position for themselves and for their family. And to have someone that would care for them, would pray for them, and then help them to get back in the job market. And to have those very same people then come back and want to volunteer to help that ministry is nothing short of divine and extraordinary. So today I have a resolution that I will be presenting to them and doing some pictures afterwards, but just know the great things that are happening in Roswell United Methodist Church along with partnerships in the Roswell Rotary and so many other groups in our state. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the well. I'm going to send it from the 39th. Center from the 39th. I'm going to send it from the Congress lady. I was about to get you getting just like Congress folks now. I'm going to send it from the Congress lady. I'm going to send it from the Congress lady. I'm going to send it from the Congress lady. I'm going to send it from the Congress lady. I'm going to send it from the Congress lady. I'm going to send it from the Congress lady. I'm going to send it from the Congress lady. I'm going to send it from the Congress lady. I'm going to send it from the Congress lady. I'm going to send it from the Congress lady. I'm going to send it from the Congress lady. I'm going to send it from the Congress lady. I'm going to send it from the Congress lady. I'm going to send it from the Congress lady. I'm going to send it from the Congress lady.

I'm going to send it from the Congress lady. Thank you, Mr. President. Colleagues, almost two weeks ago, paramedics and tifton Georgia responded to call about an unconscious young woman. When they arrived, they determined the woman had experienced a miscarriage, gestational age, 19 weeks. The next day, instead of recovering from that miscarriage at home, 24-year-old Salina Maria Chandler's daughter, who was arrested and booked into the tifton county sheriff's office. She was charged with one count of concealing the death of another person and another count of abandonment of a dead body. Since Miss Chandler's got miscarried at home, she had placed the fetal tissue in a bag and disposed of it in the apartment dumpster. She confirmed that the miscarriage was natural. The fetal tissue had never taken an air, yet due to the passage of House Bill 481 in 2019 by this legislature. The miscarried fetus had the rights of a full human being. In other words, Miss Chandler's thoughts miscarriage was criminalized due to the personhood component of Georgia's six-week abortion ban. This case demonstrates the idiocy of fetal personhood. Every woman of reproductive age in Georgia who miscarries beyond the six-week marker of Georgia's law can now be criminalized for a miscarriage. For example, a woman miscarries at home at eight weeks. She would typically sit on the toilet, pass mostly blood, and maybe if she attempted to search through the blood, she might find some fetal tissue the size of the bean. She would flush the toilet at the completion of the miscarriage, then she would simply need to rest. She has nothing else beyond this. Her freedom could be taken from her because she has now committed two felonies, concealment of death by a person, punishable up to ten years, and the abandonment of a dead body punishable by three years. This is terrifying for women of reproductive age in Georgia. It is the criminalization of women's bodies. It subjects women to either publication of their most private moments or the fearful hiding and shaming of their natural body processes. It is insanity and just plain wrong. It's injecting judgment upon the forces of nature outside a woman's control. The legislature needs to refrain from assuming for themselves the wrath and judgment of God. Admit they did wrong and reverse the personhood component of the 2019 abortion ban. Lena Maria Chandler Scott is not just one woman, she is all of us. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the well. I yield the well. I yield the well. I yield the well. I yield the well. Recognize the center from the 42nd. Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate are rise today in recognizing Senate resolution 514, which will vote on in a minute. I yield the well. I yield the well. I yield the well. I yield the well. I yield the well. I yield the well. I yield the well. I yield the well. Recognize Senator from the 5th. Thank you, Mr. President. Friends and colleagues, I'm really excited to welcome some of my community leaders at the Georgia Senate Gallery this morning. So I have two groups here present. We did a resolution last week. The resolution 471 recognized April 2025 as Arab American Heritage Month and for other purposes. As you know, more than 100 years, Arab American community contributing to the state of Georgia. And as some of my friends here today, I just want you to know I appreciate what you do for the community. And the other resolution we did is for resolution 472 recognizing and commending Aligha, Aluminium Association of Atlanta, which is the contribution to the education community service and Atlanta's largest Muslim community gathering. We do fit. As you know, we just had a fast Ramadan for 30 days. Right now we had our eid on Sunday, next Saturday. We just want to send the information what it is. And I want to ask my colleagues and friends the gallery to stand up and hope we can give them the warm welcome for their community service, what they do to our community. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the well. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Good morning, colleagues. I come to the well with mixed news. Some would think it good, some would think it bad. But yesterday, the CDC layoffs letters came out. Tens of thousands of Georgians work for the CDC. We know it well. It is a beloved institution. Seven CDC employees live within two blocks of my home here in Atlanta. They are throughout our state. They work globally. We have a detailed public health plan. Polio on disease outbreaks on smoking cessation. The CDC, whether you know it or not, plays as CDC personnel in underfunded Georgia County Health Departments. Our own Public Health Director, Commissioner, two of me, came from a CDC background. here at the state capital and in state government for decades now. There's no question in anybody's mind that's willing to look at the facts, that the CDC plays an incredibly crucial role, a crucial role in our state, in our nation, and internationally. So that's news that's hard to hear. We have people in this very chamber who have relatives at the CDC that have been laid off, who worked on infectious disease, who worked to get a PhD to go get a job at CDC and share their talents. That is yet another blow on the wrong side of the equation. Another thing that happened yesterday is a musk and his crowd put $43 million into a Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice election. They're candid at lost, bigly, bigly. I'm here to say that people have their eyes wide open, the voters have been stirred to action. They realize increasingly that they need to reject this musk-trum agenda because it promises to deny services that our people rely on and bring recession, high prices, eggs through the roof, cars, and the cost cost each American of family, $1,800. So the word is out about what musk and trump are delivering and the voters are not accepting it. That's a word to the wise as we go back to our districts. Thank you. Does any other Senator Wish rise on a point of personal privilege? You have before you a consent calendar of privilege resolutions, does any senator wish to remove resolution from the consent calendar? The answer to the objection to the adoption of resolution on the consent calendar. Chair here is none and the resolutions on the consent calendar are adopted.

Here's the objection to the senator's motion. Here no objection, motion granted. Mr. President, if you have before you a consent calendar of steady committee resolutions, does any senator wish to remove resolution from the consent calendar? Here none. The question is on the consent calendar for the study committees. Is there objection to agree to the board of committee which is favourable to the adoption of the resolution on the consent calendar? Here none. Those in favour of the study committee resolutions will vote yay, pose nice, secretary and lot of machine. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Mr. President, the objections have been filed. Is there objection to agree to the board of committee on state and local governmental operations which is favourable to the passes of the bill on the local consent calendar? Senator from the 42nd, what purpose do you ask? I ask for your name and consent to excuse the senator from the 19th. He's in conference committee. I don't know if I can do that from the floor but he's in conference. Thank you. Thank you. On the passes of the bill, the A's are 51 and the A's are 0.

The senator from the majority leader has moved that we can gross these bills and we have objection from the 4th first, which is put it up on the board. All those in favor of the motion will vote. Yay. I'll pose nay. Secretary Lamont machine. Senator from the 5th. What part of your eyes? Mr. President, is it not true that this is an enormous number of bills that we will not be able to amend, contributing to very principles of democracy and debate to get the best and brightest out of these bills?

their term of service. Some folks have moved from teaching in one county to another county thinking that they'd be getting both Social Security and TRS, only to find out down the road that, wait a minute, this school district does not also fund Social Security and TRS both. So there's been some really unfortunate circumstances where teachers were unprepared for that circumstance. This is a disclosure bill. This also has a section in it that for charter schools that are approved at the state level. There's an administrative process that validates their non-profit status as part of their facility transactions, allow state charter schools to have that done by the Attorney General at the state level versus asking for local developmental authorities to do that. So let's take questions. Do you have a question, Senator? I recognize Senator from the 26. Thank you, Mr. President, Senator here. Yes, sir. Mind the standing. When you're drawn so secured, you have to put so many quarters in. Also, that if you teach in school, they take out taxes on your pay. And you're telling me that school systems are not ready to put in what they take out on taxes of these employees which would go to Social Security. Mr. William San is some counties fund, they would draw funds from teacher salaries and fund TRS and Social Security because TRS is a qualified exemption for Social Security, there's not a requirement to do that. So a number of counties, they pull money for teachers checks, they fund TRS, but they don't put money in Social Security. So after 30 years of teaching, you may have only a TRS retirement and have no Social Security fund in your entire 30-year career because your district opted out of the Social Security system. Senator, you're the third. Yes, sir. Are you telling me you get paid and they don't take out taxes? No, sir. What I'm saying is, in counties that fund both Social Security and TRS, those counties pull money out of the teacher's paycheck to fund TRS every month. And they pull money out to fund Social Security every month, every pay period. Some counties do that. Some counties only pull money out to fund TRS. And in those counties, you could be a 35-year educator and at no time for 35 years, has any money been set aside for you for Social Security. And upon your retirement, if you didn't realize that, you've got TRS, but you have not funded Social Security at all. And that is not a surprise we want folks to find out near the end of their teaching career. This is just a notice requirement to make sure they understand that. You can imagine the horror you'd find out if 25 years into your teaching career, you found out, wait a minute. I've only got TRS, I don't have both. Because this county only funds one. Senator, from the 29th, do you have a question? Senator from the 29th, you like it, so. It is. Senator Yield. Yes, sir. Senator, first of all, I want to thank you for this myself and the Senator from the 20th gathered school district employees from around the state in Columbus and spend a day with them, primarily bus drivers, cafeteria workers, health care professionals and maintenance workers. And we were surprised at the lack of information these employees had about their benefits. So that might be true. That is true. And it's amazing. I didn't share the map for the members. There's actually a map of the state, the counties that pull out both and counties that don't. There's no real rhyme or reason to where they do and don't. So teachers moving from one county to another might not be informed that the new county has a different benefit. Senator from the Yield. Yes, sir. Senator, is this only applied with the employees being hired? No, sir, what we have in this bill is a provision for employees that are upon hire, they're notified. And then every five years of employment after that, there's a notification to folks to make sure they're being refreshed to their conditions. Thank you, Senator. Reagan, I have a senator from the 33rd. Thank you, Mr. President. Does Senator Yield? Yes, sir. I just want to thank you for bringing this bill forth. Yeah. Thank you, Mr. President, urge your support for House Bill 37. Does any of the senator wishes to speak for against a measure? Chair, here's a nine. Is there objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's a nine. The previous question is ordered. The question is only adopted to the committee's substitute. Is there objection to the adoption of the committee's substitute? Hearing none, the committee's substitute is adopted. Is there objection to agree until the Board of Committee, which is favorable to the passes of the bill? Chair, here's a nine and a four to committee's agreed to. Is there objection to the main question being ordered? Chair, here's a nine and a main question is ordered. Questions on the passes of the bill? By substitute all those in favor vote, yay. Pose, nay. Secretary, I'm not in the machine. The last question is ordered. Owned the pass of the bill. The a's are fidget two and the a's are one. This bill hasn't received direct constitutional majority, therefore passed by substitute. Secretary Reed, House Bill 105. House Bill 105, Representative Wade, the ninth and others. Between 109 to men, go section 45-9 to 78. The fiscal joint annotated with you payment for a demarcation for death or disability, generally, designating the definition of method of payment and procedure for making payments. Thus, the increase in a demarcation of war for certain public school personnel, even of death, prior to relating matters, or after an effective date, are built, milking laws, and further purposes. Mr. President, the thank you, Madame Rules recommends that this bill do pass by substitute, respectfully submit its interbrushed chairman. Mr. President, the thank you, Madame Rules, are the following substitute. The House Bill 105, the bill from the title of the next amendment, Article 1, Chapter 9, Title 34 of the OCGA, related to general provisions of workers' compensation. So, it's required that the State Board of Workers' Commensations to notify the Department of Administrative Services when the board has a reasonable cost to believe them. The injured worker is eligible. Peace out of those who are required for definition to amend Chapter 1, Title 35, the Vistico-George Antey, and further purposes. Mr. President, that completes the order. Hello, is this bill introduced to Senator from the 50th to speak to it? This is a long bill, Senator. This is... Thank you, Mr. President. I rise today to bring House Bill 105. There's two parts to this bill. One was amended. I'm going to talk about the underlying bill. What this has to do with is... And it's very serious. It's our educators, people who work in public education, who were injured on the job. In particular, those teachers that are killed at school, this was in response to the tragedy that happened at Appalachia High School. And what this does is, several years ago, we raised the payment for workers' benefit for police officers or peace officers from $75,000 to $150,000. This does the same for educators and people who work in public education. I'm happy to answer any questions. The additional portions of the bill dealing with workers' comp. I'll let my friend from the 42nd who recently filed paperwork become our next attorney general, speak about that. But if you have any questions, I'm happy to answer. Any questions? Thank you, Mr. President. I'll yield the well. We're going to have Senate from the 42nd. Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate. If you were here last year, you may recall a bill that was, we called the Corporal Puts the Oddly Act. And this year, we filed the bill did not get through the house last year. And we got it filed a little bit late and did not get it out this year. We got out of the committee, but not to the Senate floor. I want to thank the governor's office that recognized the importance of this bill and agreed to let me take a ride on one of their bills. What this bill is doing is currently, if an officer is injured in a line of duty, as what happened with Corporal Pod Scott of the Henry County, who was injured taking down and capturing an individual that killed people in Hampton two years ago in a mass shooting, that officer, while they're recovering from injuries, only gets 66% of their pay under workers comp. And so in Henry County, for example, the community came together and raised money to help offset that. So Corporal Pod Scott, who did recover, went back to work, was able to get his full salary while he was recovering. But what this bill is doing in our research on this, the current law, the state and identification fund, would allow for an officer to come and get money from that fund and get their full salary and offset the rest of their pay. And so what we're doing with this bill in sections two and three is we're making certain that the state board of workers compensation will connect those officers immediately once they get notice that the officer is eligible with this fund so they can then apply and get their full pay. And section three, we're also making every law enforcement agency in the state provide notice that our officers this fund to this one of the things with the money was there. They said no about it as this bill is providing notice of this fund. There's no fiscal impact on the state. We hope we never have to even use this, but when officers hurt and a lot of do, they now be connected directly to the fund so they can get their full pay. Happy to take any questions. Thank you. Does any of the senator wishes to speak for against measure? Chair hearing none. Is there objection to the previous question being ordered? Hearing none, the previous question is ordered. The question is on the adoption of the committee substitute. Is there objection to the adoption of the committee substitute? Hearing none, the committee substitute is adopted. Is there objection to agreeing to the board of committee, which is favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair here is none. The board of committee is agreed to. Is there objection to the main question being ordered? Chair here is none. The main question is ordered. The question is on the passage of the bill by substitute. All those in favor of the bill vote. Yeh, opposed nay, secretary, will unlock the machine. Thank you. The bill is on the passage of the bill. The bill is on the passage of the bill. The yeas are 51 and the nays are zero. This bill has received requisite constitutional majority. Secretary Reed, House bill 129. House bill 129, representative of canon, the 172nd and others. Bill Tlington, act to amend. Code section 48-5, Dess 7.4. The physical Georgia NSA will provide for an assessment of the bonafide conservation of the property and bonafide residential transitional property, so it's from removal limitation on these properties. So it's to certain entities to provide for the managed and effective date and applicability to a bill to looking laws and further purposes. Thank you, Mr. President. Members, this language should look familiar. House bill 129. This was actually some language we passed out in Senate bill 59. We passed it out of here 50 to 1. This is dealing with our cuva laws and allowing LLCs to lease land. Current law if the senator from the eighth and I wanted to lease land from the senator from the fourth technically we would be in breach of his covenant. So we're just fixing that so that the senator from the eighth and I can lease that from the fourth is a very good piece of bill of legislation. It was one of our farmland preservation study committee recommendations. I want to thank the senator from the fourth from his work on this and the lieutenant governor's office and their staff as we move this through the process. There's also a friendly amendment in section two that we're in support of and I think is a very good addition to the bill. I think the senator from the sixth will make a few comments on that. So if there are any questions on section one, I'd be glad to take them if not. I'll yield the will. You do have one question, Senator. I recognize senator from the 20th. Thank you, Mr. President. It was Senator Yew. Yes, sir. I guess after I push my butt and I thank you answer the question. So I'm going to explain the change that was made to it. Please. Yes, sir. The senator from the sixth I believe is going to speak to section two, which is the changes to the original bill that was passed out of this body. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Colleagues, section two was actually in a different bill in a slightly different form and it's dealing specifically with the post production film credits. And it came out in economic development, but when it was in economic development, it was that portion of that bill. It was actually going to triple the cap from 10 million to 30 million. It was also going to add back in the sunset that did did lapse two years ago. And then it was also going to allow films that were filmed outside of the state of Georgia to qualify for the post production credit as long as they were done here in Georgia. We have, you know, on this amendment, we have taken out the out of state portion. We have taken out the part that increases the cap. We're leaving the cap at 10 million. And we're simply adding back in the sunset at the normal five years that the senator from the 56 did the study committee years ago, study and tax credits and decided there be a five year credit or five year is enough time to study these types of things. So, the credit would sunset would begin on January one of next year, 2026. And would extend for five years through January one of 2031. I'll yield for questions. Again, the cap is not touched. You have no questions. Thank you. I'll yield for consideration. Hollywood brass. All right. Any other senator wishes to speak for against the measure. Here's none. Is there objections to the previous question bill your ordered. Here's none. Previous question is ordered. The question is on the adoption of the committee substitute. Is there objection to the adoption of the committee substitute hearing none of the committee substitute is adopted. Is there objection to the green to the reported committee, which is favorable to the passes of the bill. Chair here's none. The board of the committee has agreed to. Is there objections to the main question being ordered. Chair here's none. The main question is ordered. Questions on the passes of the bill by substitute. All those of favor vote. Yeah, I'll pose. I'll pose. Now you sector in the machine. You have to vote. On the passes of the bill, the A's are 44 and the A's are 9. This bill haven't received Brexit constitutional majority is therefore passed. Well, that might be a good one to break for lunch on. We've got farmer Watson and Hollywood brass teaming up on a bill. So we're going to break for lunch. And I think the protein has lunch. Has lunch available for the members. And we will try to reconvene probably around 115, 130, something like that. So Senate will send it east.
