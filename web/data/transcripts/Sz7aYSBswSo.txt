It is now time for the morning devotion. All senators, please take your seats and
cease all audible conversation. Dorkies, please secure the chamber at this time.
I'd like to recognize our pro-team, the senator from the 18th to introduce our
Chaplain of the Day. Senator?
Good morning, everyone, and welcome. Thank you, Mr. President. Let's first begin with
a pleasure of allegiance to our flag.
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America
and to the Republic for which it stands
one nation under God, indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all.
And now to our Georgia flag.
Pleasure allegiance to the Georgia flag,
to the principles for which it stands.
Wisdom, justice, and moderation are perfect.
Well, good morning colleagues, again.
And thank you, Mr. President.
It is my honor today to introduce, as our chaplain of the day,
Rabbi Elizabeth Bajar.
On June 1st of 2020, Rabbi Elizabeth Bajar joined
Temple Beth Israel in Macon.
Rabbi Bajar earned her BA in philosophy at Brandeis University.
Rabbi Bajar was ordained in 2009 by Hebrew Union College,
Jewish Institute of Religion, where she also earned her master of arts and Hebrew letters.
Prior to joining Temple Beth Israel in Macon, she served the congregation in Jacksonville,
Florida.
Before that, she served as a spiritual leader, a Temple Benaze, Shalom, and Huntsville
Alabama.
The values and traditions she cherishes and her commitment to fostering the closest relationship
possible between the congregation and clergy are central to her new role at Temple Beth Israel
in Macon. Her commitment to community and learning extends her roles as she is a published
author. She's also a board member of various Macon organizations, including the Interfaith
Tapestry, Leadership Macon, Mercer University and Mercer's Marriage and Family Therapy
Program. Rabbi Bihar's multifaceted career reflects her dedication to faith, education,
as you have seen community service.
She is joined today by her daughter,
Aiden, who is with us.
And colleagues, please join me in welcoming Rabbi Baha'u Lizbeth
Baha'u this morning.
Thank you.
I'm sure some of you saw several weeks ago
in the news reports about an airplane in Japan
that had a horrific incident.
Of course, I clicked the bait and realized
that it wasn't just an incident, it was a miracle.
379 passengers survived that fiery crash.
A miracle in and of itself that so many of them,
the entire flight survived.
An investigators went on to determine
why did those people come out alive?
It was discovered that not only did they have a perfect exit,
but they all left their baggage behind.
And the truth is that there are various times in our lives
when we do need to do that.
We need to leave our baggage behind.
Today we live in an era of so much divisiveness
where there is polarization and xenophobia.
Reminds me of a time period just a few centuries ago
in 587 BCE when the temple was destroyed
because of so much contention.
From those very seminal events time period
in which altered the Israelite experience,
the community had to face the realities
of the loss of an old world, a king, and a temple,
and it did so using the support of its prophets,
the prophets Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Second Isaiah.
It was the weeping prophet Jeremiah
who articulated that newness comes out of grief.
It was the priest, prophet Ezekiel,
who emphasized holiness becomes the grounds
from which hope is sprouted.
And it was Second Isaiah who practiced the value
of memory, articulating new possibilities.
Memory, of course, asserts against the amnesia for which nothing is noticed, critique, and
at times even subsequently, absolutized.
And is that lesson that I think brings us to a question, what type of baggage do we
need to learn from?
What type of baggage do we need to subsequently let go of?
As a Jewish rabbi, I carried the baggage of my people's experience.
In understanding Jewish history in the state of Georgia, this includes Jews who had
amazing profound impacts on this very state. Her instance, when the state was being
founded under General James Oglethorpe in 1733, there was an epidemic that was
threatening the colony's very existence. Two ships came, carrying 90 Jewish
individuals aboard which was a physician, Dr. Nunes, who became the
colony's only physician, STEM, the epidemic,
saving Georgia.
The group went on to establish the very first synagogue,
McFa' Israel in 1735.
We see other Jews who came up and sprouted up
and supported this state, including David and Manuel,
who was the very first Jewish governor
in the entire United States and was a governor
in this state after serving as the Senate president.
And I doubt this very chamber, but chamber similar to this.
The county manual, by the way, is named after him.
There are many other Jews who were important and influential
in this state, supporting the state's economic background
and backbone, creating stores and businesses
and going on to support the foundation of libraries
in a variety of institutions, but just as much
part of the state of those Jews who went on to support and enrich it was also part of
our history which is sad. Those anti-Semitic moments which is an unfortunate memory. During
the Civil War Jews were temporarily banned from Thomasville. It was under the influence
of the KKK in the early 20th century surrounding Leo Frank which eventually led to his lynching.
And lastly, the infamous bombing in 1958 of the temple,
and even this summer, when outside of my congregation,
some neo-Nazis march and committed some horrendous acts.
Yet I will say that even amongst all of that,
the support that my community has experienced
from the state is invaluable.
I reminded of Maya Angelou who taught,
without courage we cannot practice any other virtue
with consistency.
We cannot be kind, true, merciful, generous, or honest.
It takes courage to be able to self-reflect
and see the baggage that we have around us.
Ask us and ask ourselves, is it limiting us,
is it preventing us from going forward?
Or is it helping us?
Is it something that we can actually learn from?
And it takes courage, and I'm not speaking
about the type of courage that Atlanta's very own
Dr. Martin Luther King.
It takes small acts to lead us toward a more united,
more whole experience.
When today, that is so much of what is needed.
And it's not the courage that requires us
to put our lives at risk.
Nor does it demand that we walk into the water first,
and I'm referring to a very ancient story.
Rather, the rabbis teach us not to rely necessarily
on miracles in the present world.
We're taught that God walks with us.
And so I ask us to have courage as we go forward.
Please rise.
We pray for the power of your spirit
to transform us into vessels of grace and compassion,
restore our fractured lives so that we with one voice
may give you ever thanks and praise.
As we come into this legislative session
as leaders in this great state of Georgia,
may our deeds reveal a holiness among and around us.
May the doors of this legislative body
be wide enough to receive and hear the voices
of all who hunger for love and who are lonely for friendship.
May it welcome all who have cares when burdened,
thanks to express hopes to nurture.
May the door be narrow enough to shut out
pettiness in pride, envy, and enmity,
and may its threshold be no stumbling block
to young or shrink feet.
May it be too high to admit complacency,
selfishness, and harshness, and may you,
as leaders of this great state of Georgia,
be inspired to help the entire state
lead a more rich and meaningful life.
Thank you, and Amen.

I'd like to call on the senator from the six to introduce our doctor today is always
a pleasure.
Obviously, we like to recognize these physicians who come down here and volunteer their time.
and services to come to come, you know, visit us and the people here in this
capital. We greatly appreciate it. And I recognize a good senator from Buckhead.
Good morning colleagues. It is my pleasure to introduce this morning Dr. McClellan,
who is an Atlanta native and a 1997 graduate
of the Westminster schools right here in Senate District 6.
He earned his BA in history from Princeton University in 2001.
And while that Princeton, he played a number of sports.
He returned to Atlanta after Houston at Princeton
to get his MD degree from Emory University School of Medicine in 2005.
where he was honored with the Joseph Whitehead Surgery Scholarship. He
remained at Emory to complete his orthopedic residency training. And then after
that he completed a prestigious fellowship in hand upper extremity and
microvascular surgery at the Curtis National Hand Center in Baltimore, Maryland,
and then also pursued a fellowship in shoulder and elbow surgery in niece
France. He has spoken publicly and lectured both nationally and internationally
and continues to participate actively in orthopedic research. Please join me in
welcoming Dr. McClellan.
Thank y'all very much for having me, Mr. President, Senator Estevez. I appreciate that
nice invitation. It's a good day to be inside making laws instead of outside in
in the weather.
But on a personal level, I just want to thank all of you
and the commitment you've made to the state of Georgia.
My grandfather was actually in the state
legislature here in Georgia on a house side
for a dozen years back in the 50s and 60s J. Ralph McClellan.
So our family has an appreciation for what you do.
And then from a physician side, I just
want to encourage all of you, as you
make your policy decisions and discuss things
over the next several weeks, to think about what we can do
to take good care of the patients of Georgia, what we can do to recruit the best and brightest
physicians and maintain the best and brightest physicians within our state.
So thank you all for the commitment you've made and thank you for having me today and
if I can help you I'll be in the infirmary all day.
All right, thank you.
Are there any unanimous concerns?
Does any senator wish rise on a point of personal privilege?
Now just give you a little update here.
We are having technical difficulties with the mics at your desk.
We do have Alexandria here who has a mobile mic if any of you would like to speak from
your desk, so that will be made available to you, but I recognize Senator from a second
for a point of personal privilege.
Thank you, Mr. President.
This morning, colleagues, I rise to wish the men a Phi Beta Sigma fraternity Incorporated,
which is my fraternity.
Happy Founder's Day.
This is our 110th Founder's Day, a Phi Beta Sigma fraternity Incorporated, and today

under our guiding principle of cultural for service and service for humanity.
This year we focus on the power of our vote, emphasizing our role in civic engagement and
democratic participation and our collective voice is crucial in shaping our
communities and the future. So today, I rise to honor our past, commit to the
present, and look forward to a future where our fraternity continues to lead and
inspire some behalf of the men of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity and corporate. If
