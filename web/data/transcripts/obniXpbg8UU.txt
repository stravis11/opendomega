Well, good morning.
I guess this is what passes for a Friday here, huh?
Last day of session for the week.
And we will begin it with scripture reading
and prayer by the chaplain,
after which we will pledge allegiance
to the flag of our country.
Our chaplain this morning will be introduced
by the gentleman from the 140th House District,
the chairman of the House Agriculture
and Consumer Affairs Committee,
Chairman Robert Dickie.
Chairman Dickie.
Thank you, Miss Speaker.
Good morning, everyone.
Monroe County is home to many churches,
which served the citizens of that area,
represented homes, and represented Washburn and I,
have the privilege of representing Monroe County
here in the house.
But that's a small pocket in Monroe County.
Many of you probably not heard of.
A little place called Smart, Georgia,
right off of I-75, as you pass Versailles,
it's on the railroad tracks,
and you can probably,
they can probably hear the noise on Interstate.
And this is a home of new Providence Baptist Church.
I'm honored to introduce their senior pastor, Brian Moore.
Brian grew up in the town of Versailles
and has been in the ministry for 22 years
and the senior pastor at New Providence for 14.
He's been married to his wife, Amisa, for 20 years,
and together they have eight children and three grandchildren.
Brian called to the ministry at age 19
and he loves preaching God's Word and has the real passion for it.
One of the things that sets new providence apart that many other churches
is a love for service to others.
Brian's a real leader in this and it's evident that the many events his church sponsors
each week with many different aspects of his ministry.
This church is celebrating his 200th anniversary
When Brian arrived, it had 40 members.
He told me while I go, he has over 500 now.
So he has a real refreshing passion and energy
for his ministry.
I found a couple of people who ask about his church,
and this quote was just a couple of these quotes,
just so nice.
It said, we wanted a church with a hometown feel,
but large enough to do mission work worldwide and locally.
After meeting with pastor Brian, we knew this church was where God wanted us.
And another one is you can call a church at place of worship, a Gavin Place, a host of
events, but my church is so much more than that, it's like I was sucking home, a place
where genuine friendships are made.
That's the kind of church Brian has grown and nurtured and continues to pastor there.
So please welcome Pastor Brian Moore this morning.
Thank you, Chairman Dickey.
Thank you, Speaker.
It is such an honor to be here today.
This is not my first time to the Capitol, but my first time on the House floor, and I'm
delighted to be here.
I have been a resident of Chairman Dickey's District for 41 years, and he has been one
of our representatives for 10, so about a fourth of my life.
Yep, so we're very delighted for the work that he does.
I have prayed about what I could speak on today
that would encourage you and that would exalt the Lord.
And as I was leaving my house this morning,
I got the usual encouragement from my children.
As I get every morning, one of those is be careful, daddy.
Another one is don't die.
Another one is tell them about Jesus.
So I'm going to try to do all three of those.
And I'm delighted to be here to carry that mission out
that was set on me by my children.
So I want to read a passage of scripture
from Hebrews chapter seven.
When I think about what you have been called to do,
I am reminded of the role that Jesus Christ plays in my life.
In the Old Testament, there's many, we call them typeologies
or we call them pictures, we call them foreshadowings
of what Jesus Christ was going to come and do.
We look at the priests and we see that.
We look at the sacrifices.
We even look at things like the ark
and we see symbolizes of what Jesus Christ came
to this earth to do.
And even today, I look around me
and I see things that remind me of the work
that Jesus came to earth to accomplish.
There's a joke, be careful what you do
or say around the preacher
because you'll become an illustration in his sermon.
But I want to let you know
that you ladies and gentlemen are my illustration this morning in what you've been called to do
as a representative of your districts. You are here at the Capitol to represent families,
individual citizens of where you live. They have appointed you to be their voice, their mediator,
their interceder to the governing authorities and to the rule setters for the state that they
call home. And I just want to read this passage. There are so many similarities, but beginning in
verse 20 of Hebrews chapter seven. It says, and in as much as he was not able or not made
priest without an oath, for they have become priests without an oath, but he with an oath
by him who said to him, the Lord has sworn and will not relent. You are a priest forever
according to the order of Melchizedek. By so much more, Jesus has become a surety, a guarantee
of a better covenant.
Also there were many priests because they were prevented by death from continuing, but
he because he continues forever has an unchangeable priesthood.
Therefore he is able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through him, since
he always lives to make intercession for them.
The first resemblance or reminder that I have a thinking of the position that you hold
is that of being sworn in by an oath.
And typically in Bible times, when an oath was taken,
it was an end all to disputes.
But the validity of that oath generally was based
on the character of the person making it.
So we believe that to be true today too,
the faith that we put in an oath,
the hope of a promise being fulfilled,
or the confidence that we put in the person,
much of that is based off of that person's character.
imagine an oath made by an Almighty God, one who is perfect, one who is holy. That's an oath
that you can place trust and confidence in. It's an oath that you can say this is one that
is going to be fulfilled because God will keep his word. And the oath is in Psalm 100 and when he
states, the specific reference is Psalm 110 verse 4, I swear that my son will come as a priest
forever according to the order of Melchizedek.
But that's not the only reminder that I have this morning.
When I think about the role of a priest, the role of a priest was to be the voice of
the people to God.
He was to be a go-between.
He was to be the one that would be permitted to go into the Holy of Holies once a year,
making a sacrifice for his own sins, and then a sacrifice for the sins of his people,
to be able to speak to God and offer up prayers on behalf of those that He represents.
Just as you are here representing and being the voice to the government and to the governing
authorities, you're representing, you're speaking on behalf of your constituents.
And Jesus Christ does that for us in the throne room of God.
But then there's this last element.
And it's a picture that we really can't create in our own representation.
It says that these priests had to be constantly replaced.
As each of you will eventually be replaced, why?
Because of one truth that's going to be true of all of us, we die.
But the oath that was made of appointing Jesus Christ as high priest was based off of,
As long as He lives, He will fill this position.
Well how long will Jesus Christ live?
He will live for all of eternity.
So how long will He fill the role of high priest?
He will fill it for all of eternity.
So how long can He be our guarantee?
He will be it for all of eternity.
How long will He eat, intercede, and mediate on our behalf?
He will do so for all of eternity.
A role with a longevity that cannot be fulfilled by man.
But there's one last thing that I want to point out, and it comes up in the last verse
that I read, verse 25, therefore He is also able to save to the uttermost.
These priests were able to bring in some resemblance of salvation, but it was temporary in the
intercession that they made with the sacrifices that were never intended to completely wash
away sin.
pointed to one that would completely wash away sin.
If I were to walk in here today, especially with the COVID restrictions and all of the
Georgia State Patrol around the Capitol that I am so grateful for what they do, I would
be stopped from entering here because I do not have the proper credentials.
Everyone would agree with that.
I am thankful to have been able to be ushered in by Chairman Dickie and I was allowed to
come in because of the role that was specifically placed on me today.
But on any average day, if I tried to come in and do what you do, they would not allow
me because I don't have the proper credentials.
Well there are two credentials that were absolutely necessary in order for someone to enter
the presence of God and to remain there eternally.
And those two credentials were that they be completely sinless, perfectly sinless, but
that's only half of it.
They also had to be perfectly righteous.
That means not only have they never done anything wrong, but they've always done everything
right.
Well, that eliminates all of us.
And so the only way that we can entertain the presence of an Almighty God where those
two credentials must be met is if we have someone who is constantly interceding on our
behalf.
And we see from those two credentials that we single out one individual among all of mankind
who has ever walked the face of the earth.
There is only one who has been perfectly sinless.
And there is only one who has been perfectly righteous, and guess where he sits now.
He sits at God's right hand.
And guess what he's doing?
It says in verse 25, he always lives to make intercession for them.
And so when I, a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ, believing that he is my representative,
when I pray, there is one sitting at God's right hand, interceding for me.
When I worship, there is one sitting at God's right hand, interceding for me.
When I need help, there is one sitting at God's right hand, the only one eligible to sit
at God's right hand, interceding for me.
And when God looks over, when God the Father looks over at God the Son, what does He see?
He sees the guarantee that He swore was an oath of a new covenant.
And he swore was the surety and the guarantee of a better covenant.
But you know what else he sees?
He looks at his hands and he sees some nail scars and he looks at his feet and he sees some
nail scars and he looks at his side and he sees a spear scar where the soldier pierced his
side as he hung them across of Calvary and then God sees the price has been paid.
anyone who places their faith in the representation of the price that Jesus paid is welcome to
come into God's presence with the appropriate credentials because their representative
is sitting at his right hand.
The veil has been torn from top to bottom through the work on the cross.
That is why there is no other way to approach the presence of God because there is no other
way that satisfies those two criteria, perfectly sinless, perfectly righteous.
And so with Jesus so faithfully fulfilling both of those credentials and fulfilling the
role of interceder and bearing the scars of the price being paid for the sins of His
people, then when those of us who trust in Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior, when
And we bow our heads to pray, or when we desire to worship and Almighty God, all Jesus has
to say is He's one of mine.
He lives in my district.
I've paid His price.
He's welcome in.
You can receive His prayers.
You can receive His worship.
And when you look at Him, don't look at His sinful past.
Don't look at His imperfect ability.
look at my representation, look at my righteousness, look at the scars I paid his price for him.
So my encouragement to you as you so faithfully represent the constituents that have voted
you into office, recognize that there is only one eligible representative who can intercede
for you before God and His name is Jesus.
So I want to pray in Jesus' name knowing that He is interceding for me, but I'm going
to pray for what you have been called to do, and if you will stand and join me for that
prayer.
Dear Heavenly Father, I first and foremost want to recognize the holy presence that I
have the boldness and the freedom to entertain when I lift my voice in prayer.
It's a presence that has been bought and paid for for me to enter by the blood of Jesus
Christ on the cross of Calvary.
I know that he is sitting at your right hand right now, interceding for me, and what
I would like for him to intercede for is my request for wisdom and for understanding
to be poured out upon this house of representatives
for the men and women that make up our house here
in the state that we call home.
Thank you for putting them in the positions that they are in.
Thank you for the people that they represent.
May they represent them well.
But according to Romans 13,
they represent someone so much higher than their constituents.
You tell us in your Word that all governing authorities are set in place by you to carry
out your will.
So my prayer today can be summed up, Lord, in just asking you to deliver your will in
an understanding way to the people that you have put in place to carry it out in the great
state of Georgia.
May they hear it with clarity, with wisdom and understanding, and may they act upon that
understanding led by your Holy Spirit. Thank you for sending your son Jesus to
down the cross for our sins, making a way for us to spend eternity with you. It is
through his precious and holy name that we ask all of these things. Amen. Let's
turn our attention toward the flag for the Pledge of Allegiance. I pledge allegiance
to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it
stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.
Thank you, Speaker.
It's very nice to meet you.
You got in a good place there, bro.

Oh, I was supposed to do. Okay, thank you. I give my time back. Good morning, everyone.
I am here this morning. I'm going to need your social distancing.
I'm here this morning again to remind everyone that it is heart month and in the month of
February the American Heart Association brings awareness to heart disease with women and
I will say that over the last few years there has been some progress in some of the work
that has been done but we continue to have more work and I'm like the close by remembering
Cheryl Knutson who passed last year in her sleep after not feeling well and not telling
anyone she had a heart attack in her sleep.
I also want to remember Mrs. McLean,
Dewey's wife who's recovering from a stroke.
And most recently on December 10th,
I actually had a stroke after having a heart attack
few years ago.
And so I want to continue to encourage everyone
to be mindful of their health, be mindful of the work,
and on tomorrow at 11.30 we'll have a virtual event
featuring Dr. Jane Morgan, who is a cardiologist
and clinical director of the COVID Task Force at P.
My Health.
So we will send you all the detail on that.
Thank you.
We yield the well.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
This morning, I'd just like to recognize a group.
You may have seen some students
in and around the capital of the last few days.
and I just wanted to recognize TeenPak,
it's an organization that began here in Georgia
back in 1993 and it was started by our own Georgia
Public Service Commissioner Tim Eccles.
It's now a nationwide organization in all 50 states
and the mission of TeenPak is this,
they seek to inspire youth in their relationship with Christ
and train them to understand the political process,
value their liberty, defend the Christian faith
and engage the culture around them.
They offer classes on state government, policy,
critical thinking, and effective communication.
So if you see these students around the Capitol today,
please take a moment, speak to them.
You are more than likely to find a constituent or two
and quite possibly your future replacement.
Thanks, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well.
