Let's do it, man.
Watch your ears, guys.
Ready to go?
Good morning.
Are you ready to get to work?
We don't get started, we'll never finish.
Before I give you the official script here, I want to let you know, you just heard the first
strike of a gavel that came from a live oak from Sweetheart Circle near the Georgia Southern
University.
Now I was going to do this a little bit later, but since I have the microphone on, I'm
going to do it now.
A dear friend of mine, Ronnie Just, who was employee in, is retired from Georgia Power,
is an expert woodworker, a craftsman recognized foreign-wide for his detail in his woodwork.
Now yesterday, Ronnie presented this gavel and this strike plate, made from a fallen
limb on one of those beautiful live oaks down in the statesboro.
He's also a Georgia Southern alumnus and a good, good man on top of that.
What makes it so special was that Ronnie just, his mother, is in hospice, wasn't hospice.
Ronnie chose to come and be a special friend to me and Dale and to this body and the respects
that he has for all of us for this Georgia house.
He came to this capital yesterday around lunchtime, instead of going to be with his mother
down and about us. While he was here and his family was with his mother and his mother
side, his mother passed. So I will ask all of you, if you will, for the life and the lives
of great Georgians will and we will further this conversation shortly. But if you will, remember
those that care so much about us and about care about this institution we serve in, you
will bow with me just for a moment. Amen. Thank y'all. My
colleagues Ronnie just is proud. He's a great son of Georgia as we all are
great sons and daughters of this state. The hour for convenient having arrived
all members will please take seats. Mr. Clerk will you please ring the bell.
We're going to have the morning road call so we can all weigh in and after Thanksgiving
I'm sure we're all weighing in a little bit on the heavy side at least I am but all members
present will please vote green to signify their presence in this chamber.
The clerk will unlock the machine.
have all members now voted have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the machines
great when technology works, isn't it? No doubt. Mr. Clark, will you read the
proclamation from the governor calling for this special session? A proclamation
convening the General Assembly of Georgia and Special Session, whereas Georgia
Constitution article five section two paragraph seven grants the governor
the power to convene a special session of the General Assembly, stating in thereby
eliminating its purposes.
Whereas the regular session of the 2023 General Assembly adjourned signing die on the morning
of March 30th at 2023, and whereas the governor has determined that certain purposes warrant
the convocation of a special session.
Now therefore, by virtue of the power and authority conferred upon me by the Constitution of Georgia,
I, Brian P. Kemp, Governor of the State of Georgia, do hereby convene the General Assembly
of this state and special session on Wednesday, November 29, 2023, for the purposes and only
those purposes specified as follows.
Number one, for enacting revising repealing or amending general law for a, the division
of the state into appropriate districts, from which members of the Georgia State Senate
that shall be elected be the division of the state into appropriate districts from which
members of the Georgia State House of Representatives shall be elected and see the division of
the state into appropriate districts from which members of the House of Representatives
to the United States Congress shall be elected.
Number two, for enacting revising repealing or remending local laws which the General
Assembly deems necessary to avoid unreasonable hardship or to avoid undue impairment of public
functions, if consideration and enactment thereof, are postponed.
Number three, to ratify the provisions, the Executive Order dated September 12, 2023,
in October 6, 2023, and numbered 9, 12, 23, 01, and 10, 6, 23, 01, respectively, in
the official records of the Office of the Governor, suspending the collection of

Number four for the Senate to consider and confirm various appointments made by the governor
since the adjournment of the regular session of the General Assembly on March 30, 2023.
under my hand and the great seal of the State of Georgia on the 26th day of
October 2023 Ryan Kemp Governor the call of the governor for this special
session is why we're here we will move on with our business of this day thank
you mr. Clerk doorkeepers will you please close the doors and keep them closed as
As is our custom rule, begin our day with Scripture reading and prayer by our
chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our great country.
Now it's my great honor to introduce our chaplain of the day, one of our
colleagues. A gentleman that's opened, I think we talked about maybe five times,
times, with the opening day chaplain about five times, at least, over the years.
One of the things that, when I always think about Mac Jackson, you know, when you look at
someone and you think about whom they are and what they're about, I always think about
the surprise that must have been on Mac Jackson's face.
When down in Tenel, Georgia, he started his Sunday morning services and he thought he
He'd done something wrong on Saturday night evidently because he was a little nervous
when he saw those state patrol cars and that black suburban pull up out front.
He thought he was getting picked up, I guess.
But the speaker of this house, David Rolston, had unexpectedly and a little bit of a surprise
I would say, attended Reverend Jackson's Sunday Morning Service.
So Mack, I know that was something that's been on your heart and on your mind over the
years and certainly a great day for your congregation.
You know, Mac, Chairman Jackson, leads a congregation down in
town, he along with his wife Valerie, at St. James Christian
Fellowship, Lord's House.
That right?
That's what I thought.
You know, Mac, I know in his community, as I've spoken to many
of the folks that he represents from middle Georgia,
respect Mac as a legislator.
They also respect Max as a man of God, who works extremely well and extremely often in
all parts of his community, ensuring that he represents his congregation, represents
his constituents, and he represents his congregation in the Lord's house.
Now when he puts on his other jacket, he comes to this place.
And he is a friend to every one in this chamber, is respected by each member of this chamber.
And I would say he's loved as a member of this family by assault.
So he is a man of God who serves in the Lord's house, is also a man of the people who serves
in the people's house.
I would tell you the first is more important,
the man of God who serves his people in the Lord's house.
With no further ado, my friend,
man of the people, a man of God, Reverend Mac Jackson.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
A good morning to everyone,
and welcome to another special session.
I'm just going to be sure here I was reading last night in the book of Genesis, chapter 37.
And we find there that Joseph dreamed of dreams, and he told his dream to his brothers,
but instead of being happy for him, it says that they hated him.
Then he dreamed another dream and still they envied him, so they conspired against him
and put him in a pit.
But then Judah said, let's sell him to the Ishmaelites and make some profit off him.
And as we follow the story, the Ishmaelites sold Joseph to a man named Potifer in Egypt.
In the Genesis chapter 39 verse 2 it says, and the Lord was with Joseph, and his master
saw that the Lord was with him.
And the Lord blessed the Egyptians' house for Joseph's seed.
So Mr. Potterford had a problem in his house, and it was Mrs. Potterford.
But she had her eyes on Joseph.
But Joseph refused her several times for he said, you are his wife.
How then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?
You see, Joseph had his mind stayed on God through all his ordeals.
But one day, Mrs. Potterford called Joseph alone.
And Mr. Potter was off traveling, but he ran out of his coat, but she lied on him and
Mr. Potter for cast him into prison.
But in verse 21 of chapter 39 it says, but the Lord was with Joseph and showed him mercy
and gave him favor.
And there he met the Butler, he met the baker who both had dreams that Joseph interpreted
for both of them.
And when Pharaoh had a dream, the chief butler remembered Joseph.
So Joseph interprets Pharaoh's dream and gives him a plan to save the nation of Egypt.
Pharaoh made Joseph ruler over all the land of Egypt, even his brothers had to come to
him to buy.
They had fear because of what they had done to Joseph.
Now, can you imagine what was happening in Mr. Potterford's house when they were sitting
around the breakfast table.
They were reading the Egyptian journal in Constitution.
And that was Lil Joe as Prime Minister of Egypt.
Now I don't know about you,
but I would have wanted to choke Mrs. Potterford
if I had been Mr. Potterford,
because now they have to honor Joseph
as the Prime Minister of Egypt.
So his brothers come to him
and in Genesis chapter 50 verse 10,
Joseph said, fear not for M.I. in the place of God.
They thought that Joseph was going to try and do something back to them because of what they
had done to him. But Joseph realized that in order to walk with God, you can't do people like
they do you. He had to forgive them despite of. He says, but as for you, you thought evil against
me, but God minute unto good. You see, if you're just hold your peace, God will take care of you,
and God will fight your battle because I read what Paul said all things worked together
for the good of them who are called according to his purpose and love the Lord.
So if you learn to hold your peace, despite what's going on all around you,
despite what people say about you, you hold your peace and let the Lord fight your battles,
The Bible says, love your enemies.
Pray for those who, despitefully, use you.
Because unforgiveness is like you drinking poison
and hoping the other fellow will die.
It will never happen.
Shall we pray?
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Father, in the name of Jesus,
as we come together to do the work of the people's house,
we thank you for your guidance,
we thank you for your wisdom,
We thank you for the leading of the Holy Spirit, Father.
Honor everything that we do here, Father.
Let it be said by the people of the state of Georgia
that they honor you first of all,
as Joseph, honor you, Lord.
And be with us, Lord, and give us the wisdom that we need, Father.
And we'll be sure and give you all the praise on in the glory
for it's in Jesus' name that we pray, amen.
Would you join me in the pledge of allegiance?
The gentleman from the 128th House District has just delivered a message and we all will
take to heart.
Thank you, Mac.
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
Thank you.
Come see me, sir.
Thank you.
Doorkeepers, you may open the doors, unlock the doors, open the doors, open the doors,
Doorkeepers, you may open the doors, unlock the doors,
let the action begin.
We have a doctor of the day who is down in the clinic, I think at this point in time.
Our doctor of the day resides in Representative Sheila Jones' district.
Kelly DeGraphenread is down awaiting you to come by and visit with her, and I'll
encourage you. If you don't feel well, certainly go visit our doctor, but more
importantly, go by and visit our doctor and express to her your appreciation for
her being here today.
The clerk will now read the resolution establishing the order of business for the day.

My colleagues, we're going to move on to morning orders now,

two special morning orders this morning.
Please take your seats.
All members, please come from the any room and take your seats.
Please.
All members.
Someone communicate with the members in any room, they need to be in the chamber now.
Thank you.
We have two very important morning orders this morning.
Our state, our country in this world lost a beautiful soul.
You'll stand.
And we want to make sure that this house, the people's house,
honors one of our most noble citizens, Rosalind Carter.
the day she travels back home to be laid to rest, then the fertile ground of South Georgia.
Mr. Clerk, we have two members that are going to speak to this resolution.
And I want to ask the members if you'll stay at your seats. I know everyone would like to
join the members up front, but if you remain at your seats standing, I think that it will
be the most respectful, dignified positions we can be in as we hear these two
morning orders. With that, Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to this resolution?
Unnumbered House resolution by Representative Burns, 159th and others.
Honoring the life and memory of Mrs. Rosalind Carter.
Chair will now recognize two of our members, Chairman Chokas, who represented the quarters
and has represented the quarters his time here in the General Assembly.
And Representative Debbie Butler, a friend of the quarters, a friend of Mrs. Carter,
Debbie, excuse me, Representative Butler.
If you will come speak first and represent the Chocos, if you will join her as well.
Representative Buckner, you are recognized.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, leader Beverly and House colleagues.
always honor and a privilege to remember someone but to remember someone as special as Mrs. Carter.
It's just an awesome privilege and responsibility and I'm grateful for it.
Mrs. Carter was warm and welcoming, wise and witty and whenever I had the opportunity to be in
her presence I felt like it was a Christmas gift. It was just I always learned something and I always
in joy being in her presence.
It's impressive to me that the New York Times of all places,
in a way, talked about in their article
that she journeyed from the small town of rural Georgia
to the majesty of the White House from campaign trails
in Iowa to New Hampshire to refugee camps in Asia
to impoverished villages in Africa.
And that did sum up a large part of her life.
Her quest for education and adventure
seemed to never diminish.
And she carried it with her wherever she went.
And even as she traveled to 122 countries
and learned to ski when she was in her 60s
and fished for trout in Siberia and climbed
Kelly Manjaro, those were adventures that she used to not only tell her grandchildren
about and to maybe brag a little bit about, but she also challenged the rest of us to
continue to be continuous learners and to be adventures.
Best known as an advocate on mental health, that began right here in our great state of
Georgia. As the first lady of Georgia, she was very intimately involved with, get this,
this super long, the governor's commission to improve services for mentally and emotionally
handicapped. Georgia was one of the first and we needed to do this very much to shift
some of our mental health, public mental health, from being too much in an institutional setting
into a community-based one, and she was at the root of that with many other advocates
and health care providers.
One of the things that I thought was very impressive over the last few days since she
passed away were some of the remarkable comments made by some of our own, and one of the most
amazing advocate herself and and legislator is representative Mary Margaret Oliver and
she her quote that I think just summed up so much of Miss Carter's was she never stepped
away from her commitment to mental health reform and her often repeated message that stigma
was the biggest barrier to helping people get well.
She was with Mrs. Carter many times and admired how gracious she was and how committed she
was to every call she addressed.
As the first lady, she was the first one to carry a briefcase and have an office in the
East Wing of the White House.
She continued her fights for mental health and she also worked on things like the Equal
rights amendment and pushed as a strong advocate for the appointment of women to the administration
and to federal judgeships.
In the words of another one of our House members, Representative Lisa Campbell said she was a gracious
leader determined to do everything she could to give a voice to women, to children, the
elderly and those in need. Her deep commitment to mental health changed the world's views
about mental illness, paving the way for expanded care and parity, and she taught us how
to help ourselves help others and uplift the value of caregiving.
In 2006, I was serving as the chair of the West Central Georgia Cancer Coalition. Columbus
This area didn't have a worst cancer incident rate.
We had a worst cancer death rate, and we were selected to put the coalition together.
And as one of our outreach programs, we decided that we would use some of the teachings
we had gathered from going to America's to the Caregivers Center, named from Mrs. Carter.
And we won a National Award for establishing the Caring for Caregivers Program in the
realm of cancer treatment. Little did I know when the executive director and I flew to
New Brunswick, New Jersey, which I had never heard of and it was 50 below up there that
day. And I didn't have near enough clothes to be warm until I got inside the room and
there was Miss Carter. Former First Lady Rosalind Carter was so excited that Columbus area,
the West Central Georgia area, which included Sumter County and America and all of the counties
on that side of the state had won the National Award and she was there to give it to us.
That was a special treat, but what was more amazing to me is how she took us under
her wing and we went around the reception and she introduced us to people there.
Like we were her children and she was proud of us.
I never will forget how special that was and how that showed to me great, great leadership.
In the words of Stan Jones, many of you know and he's worked very hard on mental health
for many years, he said that because of her efforts, community-based services, supportive
housing, peer support, school-based mental health programs have been established and because
of all of those efforts, it is now acceptable to talk about mental illness.
She helped us realize we are all touched by difficult conditions in ourselves and our
families, and she has been a humane, innovative, fearless leader.
So as we start on the next 50 years of her great legacy, we need to realize she's done
Georgia proud. And she's made America great. I yield. Thank you. Chairman Chowkis, you're
recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and thank you, Debbie, for those kind words. This
This is a tribute for Rosalind Smith Carter and it's dedicated to President Jimmy Carter,
Jack Carter, Chip Carter, Chef Carter, and Amy Carter.
Mrs. Carter was a daughter, a wife, a mother, a grandmother, trusted advisor, advocate,
peacemaker, builder of hope, an inspiration to many around the world, a child of God,
and the glue that held her family together.
In her years in the White House, she was an active and trusted advisor to a husband and
present Jimmy Carter.
In the years following the White House, she co-founded the Carter Center and worked to relieve
the suffering of many poor and forgotten peoples around the world.
She did this based on her Christian teachings of service above self.
Never seeking a claim, simply doing what was right.
Fighting disease, waging peace, building hope.
At the White House and later at the Carter Center, she fought to establish the fact that
mental illness was treatable, allowing for those with mental illness to live productive
and rewarding lives.
She advocated that mental illness and physical illness should be treated equally.
And I am very proud of the great strides the Georgia House of Representatives has made
in this area.
She also founded the Rosalind Carter Institute for Caregiving at Georgia Southwestern State
University.
Having recognized the contribution that caregivers give every day and the need to provide
a resource for support, advocacy, education, and training, she worked diligently on behalf
of caregivers, both lay and professional,
to give them the recognition they deserved.
I am also very proud to serve as co-chair
to the Rosalind Carter Institute for Caregiving,
an organization that I've been involved with for over 20 years.
Mrs. Carter would say there are only four kinds
of people in this world.
Those who have been caregivers, those who are currently caregivers, those who will be
caregivers, and those who will need caregivers.
May her memory be eternal.
Thank you and God bless the Carter family.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
to both of you for those remembrances, and we will have a moment of silence in just
for a second, but I want to make sure we recognize the loss of President Jimmy Carter in his
life, and that we all recognize and say a special prayer for him as he goes through these
days and the loss of a marvelous person who was his partner in every sense of that word.
And I'll also just add, I can't add much of this, but as I think about the legacy we
all seek to leave, that legacy is enhanced in bold and by how we love our families, how
we love our communities, and we love those around us.
She certainly was an example, a true positive example how we should all do just that.
And I know her life strengthens me to make mine better, as I try to emulate what she
stood for and what she practiced, not only preached, but what she practiced.
Thank you, Debbie.
Thank you, Mike, for those remarks and those remembrances that are all bound for a moment
of silence, if you will.
you Lord for this wonderful person. Amen.
Thank you members for your attention for this wonderful lady.
We do not have any privilege resolutions, but we do have a couple of announcements as we
move on with the witness of this day.
We are now recognized as Chairman Corbett for an announcement.
Chairman Corbett.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Members of the House, the rule caucus will be meeting
over in the Ag Building at 12 o'clock.
The Georgia Veterinary Medical Association,
we've put on a program for,
so everybody, welcome, come join us, thank you.
Is that lunch, is that just listening?
launch launch launch will be served 12 o'clock all right just want to make
sure I wasn't going to get in that trouble there much better crowd when you
have lunch down about that representative Cox I think we'll recognize you for
announcement. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The Georgia Israel Legislative Caucus
today at 1230 in room 216. The Israel Consul General will be here and will be
having a lunch and learn with Arab Muslims from the Middle East that will be
discussing the Israel Amos War. So we'd like for any of you to be there and
Appreciate that support. Thank you. Thank you. Chair Lady Cooper, I thank you
having an announcement, don't you? An important announcement. It is sir, thank you very
minute much. I'm probably most of you have heard that giving to charitable
institutions is down across our state and across our nation. But and so I would
encourage you to find some charity that you can support and do so in these times when
they are having hard financial times and the need is great.
But there's one that's very important because it actually means the difference and can
mean the difference between life and death.
And that means the need for blood.
And I have a friend with me.
This is a little symbol of the blood donation group that's outside.
The mobile is there, they will be there until five o'clock.
Now I would encourage every one of you to go and give blood unless you have some illness
or some reason that you can't.
But I want to issue a challenge.
They tell me that even in these times when there's such a need that men sort of are really
resistant to going.
Now, I serve in this chamber, and every man in here has run for public office.
If you have run for public office, you are not a wimp.
So I would encourage the men in this chamber to go out and give blood and show that group
that we have a group of men that are macho and not whims.
So please, it's open until 5 o'clock today, they will be very kind to you and it takes
about 30 to 40 minutes, so please go and donate.
Thank you, and thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I didn't know you were going to challenge our manhood.
I can just tell you that.
Never let you up there if I know that.
Well, Mr. Speaker, it's really important
because every person that donates is
blood for three individuals.
You have a chance to save the life of three different individuals
and we're going into the holidays
when the car wrecks increase and the need is even greater.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Well, I'm going to take up the challenge if Representative Allen
will come hold my hand.
The doctor will hold my hand while I do it.
I'm headed down since we're adjourned,
so we're getting to that point.
So I encourage all of us, what a great mission
to get blood and the lives it says.
And I know many of you in here, if not,
We as individuals, but our families have had the need for a blood over the years.
So let's go down and put a little blood in the bank.
Okay, let's do that if you can.
Representative Kelly, recognize for an announcement.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
At 2 o'clock in Capitol 403, the House Bill 300 working group and energy utilities and
telecommunications will meet those members who are on the working grid.
We certainly like you there as well as any other members of the committee who have an interest.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
All right, listen up.
You may want to pay attention to the location of this next one.
Chairman Leveret has recognized for an announcement.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I appreciate you letting me go after the last presentation about WIMPs in the General Assembly.
We will have a meeting of the reapportionment and redistricting committee at one o'clock
in room 406.
We're going to move to 506 the rest of the week, but today it's in 406, it will be a public
hearing.
We'll approve our rules and guidelines, but then we will not actually take action on the
proposed maps.
We will just hear public comment on them and I will be presenting them to the assembled
group there.
So just want to make sure everyone's aware if you would like to come address the committee
would like to hear from you.
And if any of you out there have any spare flight jackets,
please meet me down here at the later in the afternoon.
What time and what room again?
Room 406 CLOB.
I left that out at one o'clock over over there.
And at six o'clock is the lot of time we've allowed.
So can many members, you know,
be, be, steal yourselves for along me?
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
We have, that concludes our announcements.
We have no birthdays, no ones any older, so that's awesome.
No birthdays, so with that, the majority leader is recognized for a motion.
Mr. Speaker, I move that this house stand adjourned until 10 a.m.
on Thursday, November 30, 2023.
On the motion, excuse me.
You
surprise we're waiting on the Senate. Is that ever happened before? So, Mr.
Leader, would you mind restating your motion? Yes, sir. I move that this house
stand in recess until we receive notification that the Senate is in business and
that we notify the governor and after that is received that this house stand
adjourned until tomorrow, Thursday, November 30, 2023 at 10 a.m.
On the motion of the majority leader, this House will stand in recess until we receive
all the notifications back from the Senate when they decide to go to work and we get those
notifications back that we can notify the governor of the General Assembly's willingness
to take up the business of this session.
So with that, we will also need to appoint from this House a committee of notification
that will go down to the second floor and let Governor Camp know that we're here.
So I'm going to appoint that committee and let you know who they are now before we adjourn
before we stand and recess.
We're going to appoint the gentleman from the 26th,
Governor's Florida Lauren McDonnell,
almost did it, McDonnell.
The gentleman from the 15th,
Representative Matthew Gamble,
Governor's Florida leader,
the gentleman from the 9th,
Representative Will Wade,
Governor's Florida leader,
the lady from the 103rd district,
Representative Suhong,
Governor's Florida leader,
and the gentleman from the 133rd district,
Representative Ken Vance,
The gentleman from the 134th District,
Chairman David Knight,
and the lady from the 135th House District,
Chairman Beth Camp.
They will take care of delivering the motion
when we get all of that information back from the Senate.
So here's our posture. We will stand in recess and then we will adjourn and
soon as we take care of this lagging business that we'll get from the
Senate and then we'll be adjourned and we will come back in tomorrow November
the 30th at 10 a.m. 10 a.m. Okay, that's where we are. So we need to get some
confirmation from all of you. All those in favor will say aye. That sounded good.
All those opposed will say no. I'm not sure about the eyes have it. We'll adjourn
until tomorrow after we stand and recess at 10 a.m. on Thursday. November the
30th. Thank you.
You
