TRANSCRIPT
----------
As early as we could be here, so thank y'all for being here, we'll get kicked off.
As we did last time, we're going to hopefully rapidly go through each section and move on
through the next section without waiting for the publicized time to start, but we're just
going to do that.
first thing I'd like to ask representative Matthew Gamble if he would open us in prayer.
Thank you chairman let's pray Lord we thank you for today God we thank you for the rain
and pray that you would just be with us during this time be with us during this day
God give us inside and wisdom lead us in the decisions that we have to make protect our families
is we're away. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
Amen.
Chairman Gallett, I'll turn it over to you.
Please.
Thank you, Chairman.
Good morning.
All right, we'll start on Section 5,
a Pills Court 5.1.7 increased funds,
annualized judicial judge salary expenses.
This is a two-time bump,
one beginning July 1st,
July 1 and 1 beginning January 1. 6.4.5, increasing funds,
traditional security initiatives, that's something that we've lowered from
340,000 to 108,600. That's as part of HB199 carried by Vice Chairman Kelly.
6.4.6, increased funds for targeted recruitment and retention initiatives.
That's something we lowered a little bit just because retention is pretty good
over there. We have some really dire needs elsewhere. 6.5.2 outside legal fees. We kept that
the same. I just want to call out. There's a number of lawsuits related to the JQC. For
$50,000, 6.5.2 increased funds for us out legal fees. Again, we didn't change that,
there are a number of lawsuits there,
and I think they'll have to be adjusted here soon.
6.6, this is prosecuting attorney's qualifications commission.
This is something that was under PAC before
and has been brought under judicial counsel.
That's for $1,125,000.
$6.7.2 increased funds to annualize
the salary enhancement for judicial counsel's
judicial compensation reform.
And that's something that was brought to us at $29,871.
We've moved at the $50,478 for two salary increases coming up one beginning July 1st
and one beginning January 1st.
That's all for judicial counsel.
Juvenile courts, there's really no changes there, just a minimal things.
We'll do section 8, prosecuting attorneys.
point 1.4 provide funds for one conflict case investigator that was
something that was $191,000 $191,289 we haven't seen sufficient caseload to
justify that at the time 8.1.5 we've stricken that that was provide funds for one
conflict case prosecutor at $289,021 again not sufficient caseload at this time
We have a revised number for $8.3.4, that was $201,409, we've lowered it to $201,340.
That was given to us by the PAC.
$8.3.7 increased funds for one-year revised pay scale.
That's something that we're going to look at into the future.
So we've just shaken that $1,754,395.
$8.3.8 provides funds for four districts attorney positions this is
something that we added in the amended budget but was taken out when we
actually passed it so we've added two of those positions back for a total
of $451,781 we just want to call out 8.3.10 this is this new judgeship
positions and something that we're funding half of and those judge ships these
ADA's because those judge start January 1st and we provided half at $260,000,
$620, 8.4.6 for five funds for deputy general counsel. That was $260,000, $452
of something that we have passed on at this time. $0,8.4.7 for one victim
advocate. That's something that was $60,469 and we will address that into the future.
So it was $0 and then you'll see the 8.5, really specifically 8.5.2. This is where
prosecuting attorney's qualifications commission was under PAC and has now been moved to judicial counsel.
That's all for prosecuting attorneys.
Superior courts.
You'll notice 9.3.5, 9.3.6, and 9.3.7.
Those are new judge ships for Alapaha Augusta and the Douglas Circuits, provided at
half 225,847 and then eight point I'm sorry 9.3.9 judicial sour restructuring
plan and this is something that we have increasing beginning on January 1st I
I believe.
So that's a $14,465,177 dollars.
Software Spear Reports.
Supreme Court wanted to call out 10.1.7.
This is increased funds for the pay increase.
This is moved from $668,437 to $611,168.
This is a two-time bump, one beginning July 1st,
and then the follow-up beginning January 1st.
Public Defender Council.
I wanna call that 37.2.4.
This is increased funds for a juvenile conflict
division manager position.
It was a 226,517 dollars.
We're stricken that is something
we also struck out during the amended budget.
And then you'll notice 37.2.8
for the three assistant public defender positions for those new court
circuits we mentioned earlier that was 211,169 dollars and it's all we have do
we have a motion we have a motion do we have a second second all in favor say
