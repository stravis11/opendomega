 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you Thank you Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you Good morning everybody. Thanks for being here this morning on a Monday morning 9 o'clock in the ATL. We're gonna call this meeting of the Creative Arts and Entertainment Committee together. We have a bill in front of us today, House Bill 475 by Representative Gamble. If you'll walk up, Representative Gamble. Since you didn't request walk-up music, we chose it for you this morning. A little eye of the tiger this morning. Go ahead and present your bill, sir. Well, thank you, Chairman. I appreciate that walk-up music. You know, I guess that's better than the Price is Right walk-up music that I think one of our friends played in Rules one day. But good morning. It's good to be with you all here on this Monday morning and appreciate the opportunity to bring House Bill 475 to you. We've actually seen similar legislation before last year by Chairman Blackman. but I want to make sure that you understand this is simply focused to work and help the Department of Economic Development and the film tax credit in our state and it pertains to some overall cleanup of outdated language process improvements and it clarifies legislative intent And so we as the legislature have taken up several measures in the past that were aimed to address substantive tax policies within the film tax credit program. That's not what this bill is. It again the intent is to be just a clarification a cleanup of some current language in the film tax credit So over time many of our tax and other programs need periodic review and updates and clarifications to ensure that they're in line with the legislative intent as well as some improvements to ensure that their long-term viability, applicability, and stability for the constituents is doing what it needs to do. So as in addition to that this is also focused on bringing some accounting changes in a way that business is conducted as it relates to the film tax credit so again I want to leave y'all this is not substantive change to tax policy this is about cleanup clarifying and confirming so the think the three C's as it relates to outdated language process improvements and guard wells as well as legislative intent. So let me just basically say as it goes to those three areas of cleanup, clarifying, and confirming. In the first section on line 15, we're deleting the word televised in front of commercial advertisements, which is outdated because not all commercials are on television as they used to be. Okay. Another example, section one, line 19, it deletes the word laser disc. Okay. I remember the guy that lived down the street in the 90s he's the first person in our city that had a laser disc player and that was a big deal but but most of us do not have laser discs anymore and and if we do there's somewhat of an antiquity i guess as it would be in technology as far as clarification in terms and the improvements to process and guardrails overall in section one It deals with the multi-market distribution methods. It deletes the term advertiser support sites. It adds two new terms based on how content is distributed today, which is a paid subscription-based platform and free advertiser-supported streaming television channels. It also adds a provision on Line 28 that user-generated content distributed exclusively via social media platforms is not a qualifying production activity. An example of that would be, you know, if you had a phone and you used it to record yourself and then you posted that on social media, that's not what we're trying to make applicable for

 tax credit. Okay also in section 2 lines 39 through 40 it allows the department to charge reasonable fees okay in association with film tax credit applications. Now y'all this is not going to be running out unchecked these are not going to be exorbitant fees that are going to be cost prohibited to the industry but again it allows the department to to do that as it relates to applications for the film tax credit. And then section two, line 41 through 43, some of the guardrails. It just simply states that if there's an appeal to the department's decision and the department ultimately prevails in the ruling by the Office of Administrative Hearings, then the plaintiff would be responsible for court costs associated with that litigation. Okay. Yep, that's right. And so then finally, the last part, the legislative intent, it just simply says, Section 2, lines 34 through 37, it codifies the clear legislative intent that the Department of Economic Development has the authority to promulgate rules and regulations regarding which types and distribution methods qualify for the film tax credit. And it also incorporates the part about the deadlines, the fees, and documentation that I mentioned just a minute ago. So that is what the bill does. We have three very qualified individuals from GDEC with us today that know this in and out and can speak to the day-to-day operation and function of the film tax credit. But that, in essence, chairman and committee is what this bill does. Happy to answer your questions. Yep. So, does anybody have any questions of the author? If not, I think nobody signed up to speak. All right, great. Awesome. 22. 22 I do Mr Chairman I do have one question and that deals with the fees Is there any idea what the fees are going to be Well, I'm going to defer to one of my colleagues here and let them clarify that a little bit for us. If that's okay with you, Mr. Chairman. That's the old proverbial phone a friend. All right, head to the podium. Phone a friend. Come on down. Am I on? Hey, good morning, Chairman. Members of the committee, Josh Stevens, Georgia Department of Economic Development, Policy, and Government Affairs. Regarding the fees, this is simply asking for the ability to charge a fee. And these fees would be more focused on expediting and missed deadline fees more than they would be just general application fees. It helps to mitigate those who are going through the film tax credit process and maybe miss a deadline or other. Instead of having to start over in the process, they would just simply pay a fee. So that's the goal of that. And again, just asking for the ability to charge a fee. Other states, it really, there's a lot of variation between what other states charge. But our goal is simply to mitigate those who are already in the process. Well, you brought out some questions now, sir. I don't know who hit the button first. I'm just going to go out and so number 18. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Rep. My question actually has to do with the lines 41 through 43. Do we know what it has cost our department in court costs? So, yes. Good morning. Over time, we've accumulated some costs in defending our position as it relates to appeals on the film tax credit applications. I don't have an exact amount, but they do add up over time. Thousands. Thousands of dollars? Yes. Okay. And these are fees that are paid to the state to the Office of Administrative Hearings We not accounting for reimbursement of time and labor involved in the process Do you have a rough idea of what the court costs are per case on average? Just a ballpark figure? 8,000. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I am ignorant on these things. So could you give me an idea of why an application would be denied and how often applications are denied? Yeah, absolutely. And I would like to defer a couple of my colleagues here. We've got Lee Thomas as the director of the Georgia Film Office and then I have Sarah Gershon who's our general counsel as well. So I'll let Lee probably speak to some of the ways in which an application. I appreciate the education. Thank you. Good morning. Thank you. So reasons why they would not qualify. They may not meet the spend. They may not meet the distribution. It may not be the types of projects that qualify for the film tax credit. I mean, it might be a trade show or something like that looking to run the cost through the film tax credit. So there are several reasons why they wouldn't count for the film tax credit. How often do you get those applications? In a good year, we would certify about 420 projects, but there may be another hundred or so that we do not certify for one reason or the other. What this language would help mitigate, the penalty language, was if it was a qualified project otherwise, but they just missed a deadline to get the film tax credit application in, we would want them to be able to pay a fee rather than have the whole tax credit taken away from them because at the end of the day we're still a marketing arm we want to have the business we don't want to you know make our clients angry and they doing what we need them to do they just not doing it in a timely manner thank you you Six days Thank you Mr Chair Lee thank you for that explanation Y have pretty much answered all the questions that I had to the author of the bill I'm a little upset that we're getting rid of the laser disc thing. Is that the last place in the code that it exists right now? No. No. I actually don't. I'm only kidding. Cassettes would be a bigger problem for me, but laser disc I'm cool with. But thank you all for the work that you do. I think that this legislation is definitely needed for us to move forward. Appreciate you. Thank you. At the appropriate time, Mr. Chairman. So just a real quick, I know there's been some conversations about the timing and sometimes the process taking a little longer than folks in the industry would like. So I hope with the ability to charge fees that this will help kind of grease the skids a little bit and let things move through in a more timely fashion. Obviously, I appreciate the piece of legislation on the litigation piece. And sad to see the laser disc go, but I understand. And I guess my question is, so are you saying when I put on a wrestling suit and do Facebook Lives that I cannot apply for the film tax credit? something like that out but all right so we have a motion on the table is there a second all in favor say aye opposed all right that does it thank you very much guys if you'll get your rules forms i'll fill you out appreciate you guys being here today very good the meeting ends Thank you.
