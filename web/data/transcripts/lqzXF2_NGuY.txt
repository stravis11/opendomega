I guess we won't do that anymore.
We do have a backup.
Well good morning, obviously I don't know my own strength.
The hour of convenient has arrived.
All members, all members, please take their seats.
Mr. Clerk, will you please ring the bell.
We're going to have the morning roll call, all members present.
So please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber and the court will unlock the
machine I see representing Taylor, Alexander has voted representing Taylor
Thank you. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will
lock the machines. Doorkeepers will please close the doors and keep them closed.
We will begin our day with script reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will
pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the lady from the 92nd House District
representing Rhonda Taylor.
Good morning, thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Again, good morning colleagues, it is with great pleasure that I introduce to you, my pastor,
a Monty Barnes, representative of Barnes's pastor, as today's chaplain.
This is a man that I greatly admire.
He is a leader who loves his church, his church family, and he knows all of his members
personally.
And he loves ministering, which means a lot to so many of us because he enjoys what
he does, and you can see that by some of the members from our church that are here with
us today in the gallery.
His name is Reverend Vandy Carl Simmons, and he is a native of Tifton, Georgia.
He earned a bachelor's degree in secondary education from Baudosta State University,
and a master of divinity degree from Turner Theological Cemetery in Atlanta.
Simmons is a retired teacher who taught and coached in TIFFT,
Daughtery and Clayton counties.
During his residency in TIFFT and Daughtery,
he served as scout leader and local NAACP president.
In October of 2016, Bishop Reginald T. Jackson appointed him
to serve as the senior pastor of Antioch AME,
African Methodist Episcopal Church in Stone Mountain.
And I can tell you that under his leadership,
we have groaned immensely.
We have, for the past six years,
newly renovated, the sanctuary, the fellowship hall,
have new paved parking lots.
So you can see that he is a man with vision
and he likes to do things going forward.
We don't stay in the same place.
And our mission is to be in the community for the community.
And he has worked with the Cap County
and to receive $23,000 from Commissioner Steve Bradshaw
to provide financial assistance to the surrounding counties.
And we recently secured an additional $50,000
to continue providing that financial assistance.
Anyok is known for hosting town hall meetings,
mental health forums, summer camps for learning disabled,
and we do career fairs.
And we were very active during the pandemic.
and actually today serve as a COVID-19 testing site.
Pastor Simmons is married to his high school sweetheart,
Dr. Bonita Marrow Simmons, and employee
of the Atlanta Public School System.
Pastor Simmons is a man of God who is deeply committed
to his family.
He is a proud father of two sons,
Vandorian of Lake City, Florida,
Vanquith of North Dakota,
and one daughter, the late Vanquila of Atlanta.
He is also the grandfather of Nakhai and Dorian.
I present to you, Pastor Vandy Carl Simmons.
Thank you, Representative Ronda Taylor.
And certainly, we thank God for our speaker of the house,
Representative John Byrne and one of my good members,
and I love the others of you who are gathered here,
all you public servants, we greet you in the joy of Jesus.
Amen, praise the Lord.
It is so good to see you and I am honored for this opportunity
to share with you just for a moment.
with you just for a moment, I have my time limit and I'm AME but I used to be
Baptist. So if I go over the five minutes blaming on the Baptist, I want to
I'll share with you from the Gospel
according to Matthew the third chapter,
Advent text.
In those days, John the Baptist came preaching
in the wilderness of Judea and saying repent
for the kingdom of heaven has come near.
This is he who was spoken off through the prophet Isaiah.
a voice of one colon in the wilderness. Prepare the way for the Lord. Make
straight paths for him. John clothes were made of camels hair and he had a
leather belt around his waist. His food was locust and wild honey. People went
out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the whole region of the Jordan.
confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River. But when
he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptized and
he said to them, you brood of vipers who warn you to flee from the common wrath.
Produce fruit in keeping with repentance and do not think you can say to
your says we have Abraham as our father. I tell you that out of these stones God can raise
up children for Abraham. The axe is already at the root of the trees and every tree that does not
produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. I baptize you with water for
repentance. But, after me, comes one who is more powerful than I, who
sound as I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the
Holy Spirit and fire. Amen, somebody. I just want to share with you
just for this few minutes we have here to hang out about being a
difference maker, a difference maker. You know, I really like
John the Baptist. How about you? Anybody in here know about
John the Baptist? Isn't he something special, isn't he? We
know him, those of us who've been to the church today or
to know him as the front runner of Christ, Jesus' cousin, who led the way, opened up the
way for Jesus. Just as you and I are called to open up the way of peace and love and joy,
that's our job. And I would be hard pressed to, if I did a survey, if anyone in here regardless
or why you're here. If any of you in here, if one of your reasons
want to be to make a difference, I'll be surprised.
When you agree with me that all of you who are serving here,
you're here primarily to make a difference.
Wouldn't you say that? And so John the Baptist,
He models for us how to make a difference.
First of all, if you look at the text,
it's very clear that as a difference maker,
we understand the power of one.
Look at John the Baptist saying,
he's a bad man, isn't he?
Look at him, out there in the wilderness,
one voice, one voice.
Do we understand the power of one when you ran
for your office?
You understood that you would be working collectively
and collaboratively with other people.
Am I correct?
But you also understood the power of your one voice.
And so if we have to be different makers,
regardless some time of how the crowd is moving,
what everybody's saying and what everybody doing,
my mom used to say, don't be doing like everybody else.
And I'm sure that all of us
have been told that by our parents that,
if everybody else jump off the bridge,
You going to jump off, too?
But we understand and John the Baptist understood
the power of his one voice.
And you understand the power of one vote.
And that's why we work so hard to get somebody, anybody,
vote because we understand the power of one and we understand how that
helped us and being a difference maker. Hey, man, I can't
account for everybody, but I'm you caught on me. My grandma, I
used to say my grandma used to say, if I have to go by myself, I'll
go. You know, that's a Baptist. I know I got one witness in here. But I hear you. But
the second piece that I think John the Baptist helped us with in making a difference.
It's that we must wear our own clothes. Difference maker, wear their own stuff. Comfortable in
own skin. I mean, I look around and I, I was trying to find somebody from
Tifton. I couldn't find nobody from Tifton. I heard a lot of people saying they
You were from South East Georgia.
Amen.
What anybody from Southwest Georgia in here?
What do you understand that we have representatives from all over the place, don't we?
And to me, that's a good thing to have this variety, that different voices.
And I believe when you bring in diversity, you bring in unity.
I mean, you, you get to hear from everybody but you have to be authentic and comfortable
in your own stuff.
I, I don't know about you but I can't hall the stand for Kuwait themselves and I can
read it pretty, I mean it don't take me long to read you.
I can tell when forgain wearing their own stuff.
It is so important.
I may not always agree with you,
but brothers and sisters, I can appreciate you
being uniquely who God has created you to be.
And if we can accept each other,
for who we are. I think we can do so much together. So John the Baptist making a
different, how I'm doing with time. I'm getting there. So he won? Tell your
neighbor, y'all, we do what we do in our church when we think folks are
sleeping on us. We make them start talking to each other. Tell your neighbor a
different maker knows the voice of one and a different maker where he's her
own clothes comfortable in their own skin but finally as John the Baptist modest
for us and by the way did y'all hear what the Bible say what John the Baptist
was wearing that camma hair, what clothes made out of camma hair, and a leather belt.
I mean, he sounded like he was a hot master, but look at the impact he made in his own
stuff.
Folk couldn't understand what he was wearing, but they appreciated him being himself.
I'm through. I'm through. The final piece and I think is so vital and important. A different
maker makes a difference in others' lives and give the credit to God. Amen? Just know that you
You are a different maker and you make a difference in others' lives, but always remember
to give God the glory, amen, let us pray.
gracious God. Thank you God for all of these
different makers. Dear God, we just pray as you
have allowed us and called us to be a part of your
mission. You have called us the salt of the earth, the
light of the world. And you have empowered us with such a great light to let our light
so shine before the world that they will see our good works and glory
Find you God who heals in heaven.
Help us, O God, to be all that you have called us to be.
And when it's all over said and done, we'll be able to declare
we made a difference while we yet had time.
God bless you.
Let us continue to stand and pledge allegiance to the flag.
As allegiance to the flag of the United States of America,
to the Republic of which it stands,
one nation in the middle of liberty and justice law.
All right there.
Doorkeepers will unlock the doors, members made great chaplain summons in the south
any room.
Thank you for that difference maker.
This is a whole group of different makers.
We appreciate your more of your message.

Mr. Speaker, your committee on Information and Audits has read the journals in the previous

Now we'll move on to morning orders.
Chair will recognize representing ten degrees of the 140th to introduce the doctor of the day.
We're representing Reese.
We're representing Reese.
Must be at a doctor's visit so we'll move on and we'll land that to occur in just a
few minutes.
When we're on the morning orders, we have one morning order this morning.
Chairman Hitchens, if you may, if you'll hold just for a second, I'll take the
privilege to get ahead of you just a little bit. Members, if you will, come to
order. You come to order. We have a distinguished group of
Georgia's House will come to order, distinguished group of
Georgians who are making a difference down in Effingham County in
Southeast Georgia. We have all our folks from down our way that
here for Effingham, the capital will be today and tomorrow. So
welcome to them. And just a little bit of procedure here, Mr.
Chairman. We know that you know that we have 10 minutes for morning orders and you're the
only one signed up so that does not mean you have 10 minutes for morning orders. Chair
recognizes Chairman Hitchens for morning order. And that's nothing new when we're at home.
John always makes me go first and ask you and everything else because he says I talked
longest and say the most and there's nothing left for him to say after after I get done.
But today is a special day for us for our folks from Effingham County and I think we've
got 180 of them signed up and I think a lot of them are up there today.
The balcony is pretty much full of them.
And you know as I traveled around the state, I've worked in state government for 43 years
before I came here and I was the Homeland Security Director for about right after 9-11.
I traveled to the state speaking all over and everybody would ask me where Effingham County
was and where the city of Brinkin was nobody had much heard about it but the truth of the
matter is is Effingham County was one of the original eight counties in Georgia a
really known as St. Matthew's parish and the the first governor of Georgia John
Adam Trutland grew up about four or five miles down the road from where I live
and it's only taken us 246 years to get the speaker so I think everybody
from Effingham County. He's pretty proud of John and all that he's accomplished.
And it may have had a little impact on the fact that we we filled the balcony today and we're
very proud of John and wishing well and I've become known in Effingham County now as the
other state representative from Effingham County. But and I'd be remiss if I didn't recognize
somebody from the dark side over there too. We have another F&M County that was
pretty prominent here for years and that's Eric Jonton. Is Eric up there with us?
I don't think so. He was down at the reception but Eric served over on the
other side for many years and he retired about 10 years ago but he was
president of the Georgia Senate and he retired and he just come out of
retirement. He was an architect and he just come out of retirement to be the
chief architect for the Honda plant that's going to be built in Southeast
Georgia so we're pretty proud of that. We have a full agenda for our people. We
have a reception tonight at the downtown and we we would welcome those of you
that wish to attend and the speaker told me I should recognize a couple of
other people. The truth is I see the chairman of the county commission up there
the mayor of the mayor of
Gaiton and our county commissioners and
school superintendent and the Board of Education.
But I'm not going to be able to recognize all of them,
but we do have a couple special people that we'd like to recognize.
And the first is the oldest African American business in F&M County.
Smallest funeral home, we recognize them.
They just celebrated their 75th anniversary.
And the CEO and owner, Smalls Funer Home, who was formerly the mayor of
Gaiton, Mr. Michael Garvin is here. Where's Michael? There he is.
And I'd also like to recognize Effingham County High School's Dr. Jackie Brown
Pickney, who was recently received the Social Work Association of America,
Social Work of the Year Award for the whole United States. Would she stand please?
We're proud of Effingham County and all the growth. As I said, I used to go
around and speak all over the place. People would say, where's Effingham County and
what do you grow there? We had a rural county for many years. I said we used to
to grow cotton, peanuts, soybeans, corn.
But today we grow subdivisions.
My district is the third fastest growing district in the state.
I lost 20,000 people in redistricting.
And it's a very progressive district.
We have Effingham County has the highest per capita income
on the coast, the lowest unemployment rate,
and the highest public school test scores.
We don't have a private school in our county.
We have a great educational system,
and we're very proud of it.
And I yield the well, Mr. Speaker.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
For those of you who are new members,
that's one of Chairman Hitchens' shorter presentations as he comes to the well.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And certainly, welcome to everyone from F&M.
We appreciate y'all being here.
Now, I want everyone to really pay attention to this next morning order
that we're now ready for, I think this one's special,
because of the relationship between Representative Teddy
Reese and the doctor of the day.
I'll let him tell the rest of that story.
Yes, sir.
Representative.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, to the leadership here,
to my colleagues, it is truly an honor
to introduce you to the doctor of the day.
Dr. Chastity Renee Reese, if you will stand up for me, please.
Dr. Reese, Mr. Speaker, Dr. Reese is the Speaker of my house.
I gather that.
I understand that as well.
Smart man.
Yes, sir.
The sweetness in my tea and the wind beneath my wings.
and it is truly an honor to introduce everybody
to the better half of the resource.
A determination to succeed has always
been the driving force of chassis degrees.
Born in Houston, Texas, and raised in Jackson, Mississippi,
chassis degrees is a family medicine physician
who works for Pete Montgomery's regional physicians
at Northside in Columbus, Georgia.
She attended Dylan University
where she earned a Bachelor of Science in Biology.
She later attended Tennessee State University
where she obtained a Master's in Biology.
Lastly, she attended Edward Viag, Virginia College of
Optiopathic Medicine on the campus of Virginia Tech.
After a successful completion of her medical training
and residency, she moved to LaGrange, Georgia,
where she accepted her first full-time physician job,
while there she met me.
And here we are today.
Dr. Reese is an active member of Gamma Ta Omega,
chapter of Alpha, Kapa Alpha, Sorority Incorporated,
an active member of Columbus, Georgia Links,
an associate member of Junior League of Columbus
and a proud mother of Jack and Jill of America.
She serves our church, Greater Bill Wood,
as a dance instructor for the youth dance group.
Dr. Reese was fortunate to dance with Avon Ailey,
American Dance Theatre in New York.
Dr. Reese was selected as the Columbus
in the Valley magazine, Rise and Star.
And as a God-freeer woman who loves her family
has a passion for helping the lease of these.
When asked about her service as a woman
and women shattering glass ceilings.
Dr. Restates has been a delight to work
with women throughout the years
who have selfishly given back to their communities
to make a difference.
The higher we climb, the better position
we ought to help other little girls dream big
and break new records.
So Mr. Speaker, it's truly my honor
to introduce my wife today,
and I say to the gentleman today
it's not the day to fake a sickness.
She is married.
Mr. Speaker, I yield the will.
Well put, representative, representative, Dr. Reese, we appreciate you being here.
We appreciate you sharing your husband with us.
He's a good friend.
He's going to do a great job as a representative and thank you for being here and taking care
of us. Most appreciated. Well that completes our morning orders. We'll move on to afternoon
orders. Chair now recognizes leader Beverly for an afternoon order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Arise today to honor Tyrede Nichols, a son, father, avid skateboard enthusiast,
friend more importantly a man, a black man trying to get home. Tyree deserved to make
it home. Eric Gardner deserved to make it home. George Floyd deserved to make it home.
But they didn't. Their fate was in the hands of officers who pledged to provide safety
and stability to our communities, their culture
ate this man's life for dinner.
Peter Drucker said, culture, each strategy for breakfast,
which means that no matter how well designed your strategic plan
is, it will fall flat unless your team
share the appropriate culture.
Our culture, the Georgia House of Representatives,
will not stand utterly by, while injustice prevails.
So I'm calling on this House, the Georgia House
of Representatives in general, and the Georgia House
Democratic Caucus specifically to hold hearings
to pass legislation so that this tragedy does not come to our state.
I'm reminded by Dr. King's words, and I'll read it,
because I think it's very profound for this time.
He said in 1963, now that now the other myth that gets around is the idea that legislation
cannot really solve the problem, and that it has no great role to play in this period
of social change because you've got to change the heart, and you can't change the heart
through legislation.
You can't legislate morals.
The job must be done through education and religion, well, there's half-truth involved
here.
Certainly, if the problem is to be solved then, in the final sense, hearts must be changed.
Religion and education must play a great role in changing the heart, but we must go on
to say that while it may be true that morality cannot be legislated, behavior can be regulated.
It may be true that the law cannot change the heart, but it can restrain the heartless.
And maybe true that the law cannot make a man love me, but it can keep him from lynching
me.
And I think that's pretty important also.
So there's a need for executive order, there is a need for judicial decrees, there is
a need for civil rights legislation on the local scale within states and on the national
scale from the federal government.
So we honor Tyree Nichols' life today by agreeing that this culture, our culture, will do
something so that never arrive to his day in Georgia.
For moment of silence, Mr. Speaker, you don't mind.
Mr. Speaker, I yield the well.
Thank you, Mr. Leader.
It's always meaningful when we hear the words of Dr. King.
And thank you for bringing those.
Chair now recognizes Representative Carter
to read Carter for a afternoon order.
Here she is.
Good afternoon.
Good morning, for the afternoon order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
So I've come up a few times,
since we've been back in session
to talk to you guys and invite you to join us in our advocacy
for women, for go red, for women,
to bring awareness to heart disease and women.
But today, I come sharing some sad news.
Wow, I didn't think it was gonna be this hard.
Okay, so I am really good for an amine
and someone who really helped me
as I was recovering when I had my heart attack.
And just someone who's really been there,
we all have, it's hard to find that person
that you could just always be authentically you.
But on last week, June 25th,
those senior, we affectionately call her Doe.
Winfrey passed away.
She was a Spellman grad, mortgage professional.
She was working at Sonovus, wife, mother, grandmother, and as I said, an amazing friend.
