Have all members voted if so. The clerk will lock the machines. Just come down front and sign. Our keepers will please close the doors and keep them close. As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain will be introduced by the gentleman from the 176th House District, James Berchett. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and colleagues. Welcome to the signing die. I have distinct honor and pleasure to introduce one of my good friends, but I have to clear something up very quickly. He is a good friend of mine and a great pastor, but he happens to be in one of my other good friends, John Corbett. Thanks for allowing me to approach your territory. We share where county and Dr. Lynn Barber is a pastor there in May and Georgia, which is as the crow flies, as we say in South Georgia, only about two and a half miles from my house. We are happy to have Dr. Lynn Barber shortly. He is the assistant superintendent of where county schools. He has also been the CTA director for a long time and introduced my son and my family to hog showing. If any of you have ever done any hog shows, it is a very interesting and has a distinct smell when you are showing those hogs. He has got two daughters, Colleen and Courtney, who has helped my son to learn the trade of showing hogs. I am just very happy to have him here. He is the lead pastor and sole pastor of May and United Methodist and without further ado, I would like to introduce you to Dr. Lynn Barber. Thank you so much. Thank you. Good morning. It is an honor to stand before you today and I was sitting here at the University of Virginia. I noticed this chamber looks a lot like our church because there is a big clock on the back wall and you can rest assured I know what that clock is for. But I am thankful to be here today. I am glad to have my wife Lori here with me. She is also an educator in where county and we are blessed in where county. Not only to have two great representatives and representative of the church and Corvette, but also call them friends. It is a pleasure to be here today, especially on this day. A lot can happen in 40 days. Amen. I come to you today and first of all, I just want to say thank you. Thank you for the work that you have done during this session and thank you for the work that you do for the great state of Georgia. One of my favorite passages in the Old Testament or books actually is the book of Nia Maya in the Old Testament. And one man, Nia Maya, was sent on a mission by the King to rebuild the walls and the gates of Jerusalem and God laid that mission on his heart and he set forth to do just that. And many of you are serving in this chamber today because you felt a burden to serve. You felt a call to lead. You saw some things that you thought, hey, I can lend a hand in that area and you came to do that. And so we commend you for that vision of making Georgia a better place. Nia Maya was sent to Jerusalem. He got there. He found some folks willing to work. But you know what? He also found some folks that came against him. He found some people that tried to talk about his work behind his back, came at him from different angles. Sounds a little bit like politics, doesn't it? So you may know how Nia Maya felt, but you know he pressed on. He pressed on and he kept after it. We find in chapter three of that book a lot of people engaged in the work and I enjoy reading that chapter. It's a long chapter. But you find one of my favorite verses is each person rebuilt a section of the wall in front of his own house. And boy that speaks volumes right there to the road we have to play in our homes and our families in this house wherever it may be. We each have a road to play in rebuilding something. And they worked together in chapter four, verse six it reads, so we built the wall and the wall was joined together to half its height because the people had a mind to work. Folks alike can get done when people have a mind to work, amen? And praise the Lord for a state like ours. Where things are working and things are going well and we have a lot to be thankful for. But I don't know if you caught the last part of that verse it said they built the wall to half its height. The wall was not completed. There was still work to be done. And you here today on the final day of the session and for some of you some things might be complete. Some things might have gotten done that you're working on and for some of you you may say there's still work to do. All of you there will still be work to do. There will still be work ahead. And the good thing about this day, the sign that died does not mean it is finished. There's only one thing that's truly finished and we'll celebrate that next Friday on Good Friday when we celebrate the words that Jesus Christ issued from the cross where he says it is finished. But your work is just adjourned after today and we know that you'll go home because this is a part time, this is a full time job you have with part time pay. And the words going to continue and even though you may leave the capital and go back to your district you're still getting phone calls. You're still working on issues and the work will resume at some point. So just like Nehemiah, just have a mind to work. I'm here today to encourage you for the work you've done to thank you for it and let you know that hey let's seek the blessing of the Lord as we continue to work forward together. And in that spirit I would just ask you to stand at this time as we have our prayer and then remain standing for the pledge to the flag. While the God we come this morning in a spirit of thanksgiving, giving glory and honor to you for what can be accomplished when the people have a mind to work. May you bless this body in the state of Georgia with a favor. The favor that Moses asked for in Psalm 90 when he wrote, let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us and establish the work of our hands upon us. Yes, establish the work of our hands. While we thank you for every representative here who has left home and family to do the work of the people, we thank you for the vision that you've given each man and woman who served in this house. Lord for areas of work you've shown them that need to be rebuilt and restored, we thank you for the work that has been accomplished during this session. And Lord we know that all work is hard. We also know that this work we call politics can be hard. Relationships are built but they can also be strained. And Lord we praise you for those here who are examples of civility and statesmanship even in the midst of hard fought battles. Lord we ask for your blessings upon our state, its leadership and its people. We ask for you to pour out on those here a double portion of wisdom, discernment, grace and a spirit of service. May you bless each legislator as he or she leaves Atlanta and goes back home. Bless them in the time between the sessions as they continue to represent us. Bless them in their homes and in their work. And we pray that you will continue to bless our state in Jesus' name. We pray. Amen. Would you join me into pledge? I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation on a God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Well members I have a question. I appreciate the past noting our salaries. I think maybe Wipberchett was setting the stage on his tithing amount when he discussed that low salary. I'm not sure if that was the case or not. Pastor we appreciate those words and thank you for being here and making the effort to come all the way to Atlanta and speak to us. It was a great message. Thank you. Doorkeeper's may unlock the doors. Members you may join the pastor in the south any room and have a photo if you'd like to do so. House will come to order. Chairman Tarvan the chair of the committee on information and audits is recognized. Y'all listen up. Give your full attention to the chairman. Thank you miss speaker. Miss speaker your committee on information and audits has read the journal from the previous legislative day and found it to be correct. And Mr. Speaker I appreciate you. I want to ask to have a little bit extra time this morning. I want to thank the people of this chamber for listening to me every morning and today something that's very important to me and as I watch the national news I seek concerns. I had a very excellent believe it or not elementary school education and I love those people and they remain friends of mine till they're death. They taught me some things that weren't exactly right and after I got older I found out. The thing that's real dear to me is US Constitution and some things I was taught earlier in life were not exactly what it says and after I got older I read the Constitution and studied the Federalist papers and the writings of James Madison who was at every day of the convention and took notes and saw what they intend. I want to challenge this group to read the Constitution. Forty-four hundred words without the first ten amendments and it was find out the intent and what the purpose of the Bill of Rights was. Very important and what brought this to mind was today's quote that I'm going to give you was an original that probably hadn't heard before and I saw where a governor of a state was being refused by the students to allow to speak at a state institution and if we've come to the point that we cannot speak publicly no matter what your beliefs are we're in trouble and this we were taught that by Madison that the Constitution needed to be adhered to no matter if it pinched or pleased and so today my quote is this republic not strictly adhering to the Constitution is likened to a rudderless ship pushed to and fro by the ever-changing winds. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Thank you Mr. Chairman all that know you know that you're a scholar and I mean that very sincerely we appreciate your work we appreciate your friendship and we appreciate your deep hell hell beliefs. Chairman Tarvan the Chair of the Committee on Information and all its reports that the journal or the previous previous legislative day has been read and found to be correct is there an objection to dispense with the reading of the journal that Chair here's done the reading of the journal is dispensed with is there an objection to the confirmation of the journal that Chair here's done and the journal is confirmed. Mr. Chairman I think that's 40 times you've done that and you've done an excellent job so we appreciate your sticking with us and getting the job done. I think this is your 40th time to Chief I'm active as Chair of Information and all that so we appreciate your words during this session thank you very much.

So give your attention. Representative from the 59th, Representative Phil Laillet will introduce the position of the day. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It is my pleasure to introduce to you all today's doctor of the day, Dr. Delphine Head. Dr. Delphine Head is an incredible physician, a good friend of mine. She is a family practice primary care physician with the Southeast Kaiser Permanente Medical Group. She provides care at the Kaiser location down in Cascade. She chose family medicine because she enjoys developing relationships with her patients and treating generations of families. She truly believes that she was born to be a physician and is excited to fulfill her purpose in life. Dr. Heads has been an incredible advocate for her community, a supporter of mine on the campaign trail and now is an elected official and it is my pleasure to be introducing Dr. Heads to this body this morning. Dr. Heads. Thank you, Representative Olala. Mr. Speaker and other representatives and distinguished guests. And thank you all for the warm welcome. It is a pleasure and an honor to serve as Dr. Delphine Head. It is also a privilege to serve Georgia as a member of the Southeast Permanente Medical Group through Kaiser Permanente. While some of you may not be familiar with our practice, we are the largest physician-owned physician-led medical group in Atlanta. I practice at the Kaiser Permanente at Cascade Medical Office, which is one of our 26 locations. As my bio says, I am honored to practice medicine in the same community where I was raised. Because I am an Atlanta native, I have lost count how many times I have passed by this iconic building. So it is an honor for me to actually be serving here once again. It is more meaningful than words can say. So thanks again for the warm welcome. And I look forward to serving you on today and I promise there are no co-payments involved. Thank you so much. Dr. Heard, we appreciate you being here and thank you for your service. We are going to move on to morning orders. Last time I checked, this is day 40. So I am going to remind you of something on day 40. We can contemplate it over the time that we are back home working for our constituents. This will take just a second if I can have your attention. This is a concerns morning orders. You all have done a good job with morning orders. I am making sure we recognize our guests that are here. So if you will listen up, I will read you. I know you can all read. But I am going to remind you of rule 40.1. Morning orders shall be ordered immediately prior to the reading of bills and resolutions for the third time and lists otherwise ordered by the speaker. There shall be a 10 minute period during which members wishing to engage in a morning order may speak. Provided however that no member may speak for more than five minutes. Some of you are challenged by that one. All requests to speak must be received by the messenger. Or as the speaker may designate or as I designate the messenger or as far in advance as possible. Speakers shall allocate the time. Members can speak up to the overall time limit. Now this one is important. Morning orders are limited to the purpose of acknowledging individuals or groups in the gallery. I know we have done a great job of that. I am not reading that rule for any reason other than to remind you. As you prepare yourself when we come back here in January of 2024 as you acknowledge your constituents and very important issues that may arise in all of our lives. This is how we should conduct morning orders. As you all know we have people who travel distances to be in the gallery to be recognized. We have been very lenient to make sure those people are recognized. As this house moves forward as we tend to the business of this house in the future. When we come back here I hope all of you all will help me stay on track and as we are going to do this morning. So we are going to recognize members from morning orders. If you will give them your attention. No we are not going to do a time. I want to trust them to be short and to the point but certainly acknowledge those that need technology. Representative Rhonda Taylor is recognized for a morning order. Representative Taylor. Remember I told you all about on deck. That means be ready. Representative Hagen, Seba and Williams. Thank you Mr. Smith. Thank you. Colleagues please help me wish and recognize on the final day of session and the continuing celebration of National Women's History Month. We have in the gallery with us today Ms. Hong-young Chow. If you please stand so that you can be seen Ms. Young owns several businesses in Rockdale County. She is an advocate arriving from South Korea in 1989. She has done so much in our community and to build businesses and to make sure people have employment. And I just wanted to recognize her as a woman on the move. And I thank you so much for coming. If you would join me in giving her a hand clap please. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Thank you and welcome to the People's House. So Representative Kimberley knew and she's had some friends. Representative Hagen. Representative Sebaugh. So you've got good friends. Ladies recognize. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Thank you members of the House. Today is a very special day. We have some great guests here. We have a world class soap box Derby winner. Alexa Garen. Please stand up. She's up there in the gallery with her family Roy and Su-Garen. Petra and Sean Valdiviso. Would you all please stand? I'd like to congratulate Alexa Garen for her outstanding performance at the 2022 National Derby Rallys in 2022 World Championship. She won a national title in 2021. The USDR invitation secured both the Legacy and Round Bottom Division at the 2022 Indie-A-R. And was recognized as the 2021 and 2022 National Points Champion. Alexa is a fourth generation racer. She began race in soap box Derby in 2017. And as a result of her own hard work and dedication she now places among the top drivers in the world. Although drivers are tipped to qualify for the world championship and make the All-Star in one division, this young lady has qualified for two. The Superstock and the Masters. This is an unprecedented feat that once was thought impossible. This amazing young lady epitomizes courage, determination, leadership, character, all necessary to attain excellence in athletic performance. She has earned the respect and admiration from her peers and her challengers. It is my honor to recognize Alexa Garen and her family for outstanding performance and extend the best wishes for success in the future. Welcome to the people's house. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Dog has diligently, constitutionally devoted in numerous hours of his time, talents and energy toward immigrant rights by serving as a voice for those who are disenfranchised, speaking against unjust bills, and educating members of this body on the benefits of common sense immigration reform.

Good to see you guys. Thank you. Members, we're going to take up a couple of other issues that I'll speak to you first about. We're going to take up some uncontested house resolutions. These are for study committees. Members of this house have indicated they would like to study a lot of important issues, important issues. Everyone that was submitted has great merit. So I'm going to suggest something to you. We're only going to a point to how study committees. I'll also encourage you, those of you who have an interest in studying a particular issue, committee chairs understand the posture we're in or the posture I'm in as we address all of the issues that I'm in and I'm going to have a hearing on those subjects to work with you over the interim until we come back here in 24. With that, we're going to have a resolution, we're going to hear house resolution 519 and house resolution 603. If there is no objection, we will vote on the uncontested resolutions as a whole with a recorded vote. Hearing none, it is so ordered. The clerk will read the resolutions. House resolution 519 by Representative Jenkins of the 136 creating the House Study Committee on Fishing Access to Fresh Water Resources. House resolution 603 by Representative Cooper and others creating the House Study Committee on Certificate of Need Modernization. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered on the resolutions? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there an objection to agreeing the report of the committee which is favorable to the adoption of the resolutions? Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Is there an objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules? Chair, here's none. The Rules Committee substitute is adopted. Shall these resolutions now be adopted? All in favor of adoption of the resolutions will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. For what purpose is Chairman Halkins rise? He waves, I guess, since his button was matched for what purpose is represented, Townsend rise. Get the wrong button, Mr. Speaker. Makes me feel better about you. Have all members voted. Have all members voted if so. The clerk will unlock the machine. On the adoption of the resolutions, the yeas are 170 and the nays are zero. These resolutions have been received through requisite constitutional majority or therefore adopted. You

you House will come to order. We'll move on to the rules calendar Getting closer to the end all the time clock's ticking Mr. Clerk No, how you're not excuse me no representative Williams. You're not recognized for that motion I know the one you want to make, but you're not recognized Mr. Clerk where you read the caption of Senate bill 272 272 Senate bill 272 by senator Kennedy the 18th and others to me title next to title 15 in the fiscal to Georgia and tentative relating to courts This amended so the supplement the duties administrative judges to reestablish a criminal case data exchange board to repeal code section 156 50.3 relating to the criminal case data exchange board This bill ever refer to the committee on judiciary non-civil that committee recommends a disbilled do pass by committee substitute The gentleman from the eighth House district chairman Stan Guthrer is recognized to present the bill Thank you, mr. Speaker colleagues Senate bill 272 is an update to a bill passed by the general assembly last year Senate bill 441 The intent behind that bill was to update the states in adequate system for transmitting criminal histories or History records this bill builds off of last years by improving on the work of the criminal case data exchange board in place in the board and the administrative office of the courts and judicial Or I should say with the administrative office of the courts and the judicial council Currently the board is attached to the clerk's council The boards work over the last nine months has shown that the problems with criminal records is bigger than simply the court clerks It's an issue that spans the judiciary and this bill moves the that board to the appropriate agency that supports the state's judicial system The bill continues to recognize the importance of the clerks to play in the transmission of criminal data and maintains their seat on the board They are an integral part of this of this system, but are not the only players Because the records at issue are mainly generated by the judiciary and officers of the court the judicial council and Administrative office of the courts are best position to see to it that uniform standards are created and adopted This bill also empowers judges to assist all courts within their circuits to comply with the criminal records transmission It was estimated that seven million criminal charges were without a final disposition and 5.4 million of those have languished for years Having open charges on file negatively impacts the ability of judges and Criminal justice agencies to have accurate criminal history data and further impacts our citizens ability to get jobs Educational opportunities and housing I'll stand for any questions You have will you do have a question now Chair recognizes to your right stream right behind you almost Repair to advance Smith for question Jim on you. I yield. Thank you In it true that the the sharing vent sharing of information is very very important and in it true My I have a clerk that was very concerned about this bill had she'd put in a lot of work and so I just wanted to pass that along to the chairman Thank you I appreciate that the clerks are a very important part of all of this But they don't have the constitutional authority over all the data producers which are the courts themselves And so this bill will put this with the judicial council that should make it more efficient As a district attorney years ago I was noticing that criminal history reports were almost getting unreadable by the time I left the bench they were about unreadable The software that's being used to create those histories was Written back in the 70s and so it's just an antiquated system and I've been as a person from the judicial branch Waiting like 16 years To get this fixed and so I'm hoping that this will take care of that. Thank you Gentlemen yield for another question. Yes, may I ask you a question? Yes, sir Gentlemen yields isn't not true that just for the members to understand the perspective You have on the issue that you served in a previous checkered past as As a district attorney and as a spirit court judge. I do have a checkered past for sure Well, there is that I'm sorry. I said that about you now. I apologize Representative Bert Chittt. Whitt, Bert Chittt is recognized for a question if you'll take one Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does gentleman yield? I yield isn't it true that the clerks are the keeper for the most part of all the Records. Yes, that's true. But isn't it also true? Mr. the gentleman yield? Yes, isn't it also true that This move will allow the While the clerks are the keepers they don't have the authority to ensure that The other parties that will be sharing their records will share their records isn't that also true? That is correct Yes, thank you for bringing a bill. Thank you Gentlemen has no further questions. Thank you. I ask for your favorable consideration. Thank you Gentlemen as you do the well we do have someone Speaking in favor of the bill representing Marvin Liem is recognized to speak to the bill Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I wanted to speak very briefly in enthusiastic support of Senate bill 272 My contribution here came in discussing with practitioners earlier this year Substantive policy around hate crime self-defense and other such issues that we know get a lot of attention and that we may all have our opinions on yet Knowing and ultimately expressing to those practitioners that despite whatever our individual opinions We don't necessarily have sufficiently robust data on many of these issues in order to successfully inform many possible Substantive procedural or jurisdictional interventions in my own previous work looking at specifically self-defense and speaking to clerks Archivist court personnel as well as law enforcement prosecutors and public defenders We knew that people were invoking various types of defenses and providing critical information at various stages of the process However, this information was not being documented in anywhere close to a legible reasonably consistent way across the many court jurisdictions where such information could be documented in very efficient and Non-burden some ways that would ultimately inform policy with that I appreciate these practitioners Senator Kennedy and our Senate colleagues for listening and working to conceive this bill with this bill We can take a huge steps towards doing all of this that I just mentioned so I look forward to voting favorably on Senate bill 272. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and I yield the well The gentleman has yielded the well is there an objection to the previous question being ordered chair Has none the previous question is ordered is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute chair Has none the committee's substitute is adopted is in objection to agreeing to report the committee Which was favorable to the passage of the bill that chair has none the report the committee is agreed to Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes all those opposed will vote no and the clerk We'll unlock the machine You Have all members voted All members voted If so the clerk will lock the machine On the passage of the bill the yeas were 146 the nays 21 the bill haven't received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed You You You Clerk will read the caption to Senate bill 63 63 Senate bill 63 by Senator Robertson the 29th another is being titled nacked to amend chapter 6 of title 17 The official go to Georgia and it had a relating bonds and recoguses So used to provide for the setting of bonds and the scheduling of bail This bill then refer to the committee on judiciary non-civil that Bill That committee recommends that this bill do pass by rules committee substitute Representative Houston Gaines is recognized to present the bill Thank you, mr. Speaker This morning, please to present Senate bill 63 This measure establishes Georgia as a state that won't accept the soft on crime policies That we've seen in places like New York California Illinois or catch and release his resultant criminals simply walking into the jail and walking right out Unfortunately in several counties in Georgia. We've seen increasingly letting repeat offenders either out on no or small bond serious criminals and I have several examples. I could point to where these were again serious Charges that individuals walk right into the jail and walk right out with putting up no bond Whether it's rioting I'm looking at several examples from counties throughout the state theft shoplifting theft by deception and siding rioting There's example after example Unfortunately throughout our state of this issue where we have soft on crime policies that are making communities Across our state less safe a recent study showed that in Fulton County alone Close to a third of the individuals released on no cash bail failed to show back up for their court date The city of Atlanta and other counties and municipalities in Georgia have established no cash bail policies This bill will simply require a judge to see those individuals before deciding on bail It would even allow a judge to issue a one penny one dollar or a one thousand dollar bond It just states that it must be secured bond a Lot of folks seem to be more worried about those committing the crimes But really we should be worried about the victims of these crimes We need to start putting a more focus on the individuals who are impacted by crime rather than those committing them and making sure that we're addressing violent criminals throughout our state Imagine being a store owner who's had his store broken into repeatedly finding out the judge Simply less that individual who committed the crime out over and over and over on no cash bail That's what's happening unfortunately in parts of our state and this bill will help address that make sure we don't follow and Suit a places like New York and California Illinois and by the way New York of all places has even started to backtrack on its no cash bail policy Seeing how disastrous. It's been for public safety in that state Again nothing in this bill prevents a judge from issuing a one penny bond on any of these charges a one dollar bond on any of these charges They can continue to have a standing order. That's an issue we've seen and that's a part of this bill addresses as standing orders as Throughout our state they can have a standing order for a one dollar bond But the but the folks in that community should be aware of what those judges are doing and letting folks out on a one dollar bond instead of Again, what we've seen in no cash bail so this bill really again to sum it up has two key objectives ensuring that cities and counties that have established blanket no cash bail policies This bill addresses that issue Says that criminal violations including municipal violations that are subject to confinement Will require an individualized bond hearing before a judge There'll be no more catch and release on municipal violations that are subject to confinement and It adds a number of offenses such as street racing To the list of bail restricted defenses again once more that nothing prevents a judge from issuing a one dollar bond on any of these charges But they need to see a judge and that's what this bill does mr. Speaker I know there are several speakers lined up to speak to this measure So I'll yield the well and ask for the body's favorable consideration of Senate bill 63 The gentleman has yielded the well Here's our posture. We have a number of folks who we Like the language and we have a number of folks who don't like the language So we're going to allocate 30 minutes up to 30 minutes on both of those propositions and then we'll move on to a Minority report and the chairman's time I Representing Kennerd is recognized to speak to the bill Thank you mr. Speaker I rise this morning in opposition of SB 63 in a previous speech I highlighted the fact that if you look In a previous speech I highlighted the fact that if you look behind the bars of Georgia State prisons You'll see three groups that are over represented one is the mentally ill Others are minority groups and thirdly the poor so one can argue that in Georgia we have criminalized mental health Millenialimus we have criminalized race and we have criminalized poverty That is why Brian Stevenson who wrote the book just mercy he says that in our current criminal system You're treated better if you're rich and guilty that if you're poor and innocent Therefore wealth not copability is turning our is Impacting our justice outcomes Another way to put it is this you get as much justice as you can afford please vote against SB 63. Thank you mr. Speaker The gentleman has you to the well Rept. Kendrick is recognized to speak to the bill Thank you mr. Speaker today. I rise to ask you to vote no to SB 63 and Let me start with a story that I often tell in this chamber about how God has a sense of humor So many of you know that I'm a lawyer and graduated from UGA 16 years ago and I had to take criminal law my first year with professor Dean Kurtz And I will admit that out of the four degrees that I have Criminal law was my worst grade ever in life So when the opportunity came for me to take criminal procedure. I said no way There's no way I'm ever going to use criminal law or need to know any criminal laws whatsoever I was going to be a corporate attorney which I actually am But now I've served on the judiciary non-civil committee for the past eight years So God definitely has a sense of humor But I'm actually glad that I didn't take criminal procedure because the crash course that I've gotten On the judiciary non-civil committee has taught me a bunch of truths, but the main one is his taught me is this The criminal justice system is not broken is fixed It's fixed to be a revolving door Fixed to benefit those they're gonna can't afford the best attorney Fixed to put everyone and anyone behind bars and to punish the least of these and those who cannot secure buttons I Will submit to you today that our criminal justice system is in fact not broken. It is fixed So if you can turn to me with me to page four of SB 63 and look at lines 88 through 129 There are 31 31 new offenses proposed to be added to the statute for secured buzz It's so extensive extensive that legislative council had to start doing triple letters And I don't think I've ever seen that in the last 13 years that I've been elected Lines 151 through 52 lines 156 through 57 and lines 161 through 162 all restrict judges ability to release the accused on an unsecured judicial release So I'm gonna ask this question again. This is my third time asking this session Why do we have elected officials if all we're going to do is continued to tell them how to do their jobs There isn't even consistency in the bill if you look at lines 88 93 98 and 122 this bill only applies if this is the person Second or subsequent of this Now that's very strange. Why don't the other offenses get as much grace it makes you wonder So in conclusion now I'm tired of getting up here Telling how we are moving backwards in the state as opposed to for So I submit to you again that the criminal justice system is not broken. It is indeed fixed So I'm asking you to vote no to SB 63 Thank you, mr. Speaker I yield the will Lady has yielded what yielded the well represent an otherwise is recognized to speak to the bill One of the best dressed ladies in the house Thank you. Thank you, mr. Speaker I Rise before you today as a woman dressed in white Who is about to share with you a quote from the man in black? It was Johnny Cash who lamented that he wore black these are his lyrics For the poor and the beaten down. I'm not gonna sing for the poor and the beaten down Living in the hopeless hungry side of town I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime But is there because he's a victim of the times I appreciate those of y'all who are mounting along with me Not so long ago Nathan deal was governor of this state I was honored to be sworn into this house in time to serve during his final year as governor When I first came to this house. I was not sure what to expect from a Republican governor But I quickly realized the governor deal was gracious and is gracious thoughtful and kind I also did not expect to learn That he was a leader who was unafraid to wear his heart on his sleeve I Realized this the first time I visited the governor's mansion. It was Christmas time. It was a holiday reception And I saw the tears in his eyes and heard the catch in his voice As he told us about the gingerbread models of Georgia court houses that had been crafted there at the mansion By the trustees who worked at the mansion the trustees the inmates Who served at the mansion and who the governor and the first lady the late first lady often remarked that they thought of as part of their family When governor deal left office in January 2019 There was wide spread agreement that his most enduring legacy was his leadership and his commitment to criminal justice reform in Georgia When he came into office when governor deal came into office one in 13 Georgians We're either incarcerated on probation or on parole Governor deal realized that at that rate of incarceration We would have no recourse but to spend more than a half a billion a half a billion dollars on two new prisons He knew there had to be a better way And he led by partisan policy initiatives to ensure that this better way that he knew could happen was a reality in Georgia and Despite the rhetoric that we're hearing today by the way We did pass a street racing bill in the last biennium By the way because there is still a prosecutorial discretion I can think of one case in particular a really tragic case where two young people were killed as the results of street racing And one of the people involved in that who by the way left the scene of the accident Was allowed to be charged with only a misdemeanor Neither here nor there Despite that rhetoric that we're hearing today the crime rate in Georgia decreased after these reforms were enacted by governor deal Governor deal and this general assembly knew That Georgians the folks back at home who probably aren't watching this today But the folks back at home these Georgians knew that it does not make any sense at all to spend tens of thousands of tax-payer Dollars each year just to incarcerate one nonviolent offender one inmate Governor deal with muse and I'm paraphrasing here He would muse that there are the criminals who we're afraid of and there are the criminals who we are mad at This is a quote from governor deal There comes a point when incarceration no longer serves a purpose There comes a point where retribution ought to stop and Rehabilitation ought to take over SB62 is just one more attempt to walk back governor deals reforms to walk back those reforms that had in many cases unanimous agreement in this chamber It's just one more way to hack away a governor deal's legacy Keep on shopping, right? So if this measure passes what's next on the priority list for the folks who were perpetuating this regression of the reforms led by governor deal Are we going to walk back our support for accountability courts? Like the veterans courts that have transformed the lives of those who nobly served our nation But who weren't always able to conquer the demons that followed them back to the home front? the drug courts and the other accountability courts that offer nonviolent offenders a second chance to be a father a mother a valued employee and engaged citizen The leadership that governor deal in the Georgia General Assembly shared and showed through our Commitment during these years of successful criminal justice reforms took courage It took courage It took the courage of the leaders in this chamber It took the courage of those of us who had to go and face accusations that we might be soft on crime It took courage and we showed that courage We should all be so proud of that courage and it is so vexing This is why it is so vexing and is heartening To witness the cognitive dissonance that seems to have taken a hold of so many in this body who once worked so hard to enact these reforms And it is for this reason that I urge you to vote against SB 63 I yield the well The lady has yielded the well will park has recognized to speak to the bill Representative Thank you, Mr. Speaker I rise in opposition SB 63 this is yet another bad bill that The appearance of which is to look like we are being tough on crime Again, we have the capacity as legislators in this information age to craft good policy Based on an understanding of what works best I don't understand Why despite all the bipartisan reform we are continuing to undermine the legacy of governor deal as a representative of an eloquent so eloquently stated Those reforms not only helped build long safer communities in the long run they helped save taxpayer dollars Now let's go into The this bill a little bit this rule substitute that just came out a few hours ago in which my colleagues and I will strongly oppose Again because it is bad policy. I did have a few questions I wanted to initially raise of the presenter of the bill though unfortunately I did not have an opportunity to do so But to begin the bill seems somewhat hastily drafted I would point direct members attention to lines 138 to 140 and how that essentially conflicts with lines 151 to 155 and Subsection E lines 138 to 140 says and elected judge and appointed judge or judge sitting by a designate by designation may Issue an secured judicial release if such Unsecured judicial release is noted on the release order that's current law that was clarified with a few edits Yet if you look at lines 151 to 155 in particular which is new law now It's saying that no person charged with the bail restricted offense shall be eligible for release by any judge on an Unsurcured judicial release So we have current law saying a judge may issue And unsecured judicial release and new law this bill stating that a judge may not do so If this bill passes what is a judge supposed to do on this issue? Clearly, I think this is an issue that needs additional time as opposed to rushing something that it yet again would undermine The good bipartisan work this body and this legislature has done over the years to help protect safer communities now. Let's talk about Let's talk about this issue broadly speaking Preach trial release is only available when a judge has determined that the accused poses no risk to public safety So to argue that this bill will increase public safety is not true Georgia law allows judges to release accused persons from j

from jail pretrial only after first determining that to do so would not create a substantial risk to public safety. So we're undermining judicial discretion. We're undermining their opinion, especially when they're in front of the facts of this case. Now, studies have shown that people who are detained in pretrial are more likely to be convicted and face longer sentences than those who are released before trial. More over some studies have shown that pretrial detention increases the likelihood of recidivism as does extended involvement in the criminal legal system. At the same time, there is no consensus among experts that cash bill meaningfully increases the likelihood that a person will return to court for subsequent proceedings. So lawmakers hoping to encourage people facing criminal charges to return to court should explore proven solutions like texture minors and well-designed summon reforms. Again, SB 63 will undermine public safety and do nothing to reduce failure to appeal, failure to appear rates. Along with limiting judicial discretion and bail determinations, as briefly mentioned, this bill will result in increasing the jail population across this state. So who does this bill really benefit? If we're just going to have higher populations in our jails? Not only will that benefit our private prison industrial conflicts in this state, it will burden local governments and taxpayers while doing nothing again on public safety. SB 63 severely restricts the discretion of duly elected judges granted discretion to make individualized bond determinations. And if this bill becomes law, judges will be required to impose more financial conditions for pretrial releases, resulting in the issuance of more secured bonds, higher pretrial detention costs for local governments, and increased revenues to the bail bond industry. The presenter of this bill said, $1 secured bonds. I'm not aware of whether or not you could get a $1 bond for something that's secured. My understanding is generally, if it needs to be a secured bond, that requires property of significant value. What then would be the issue or the point of this bill if you're saying there's flexibility that's not, when there's no actual flexibility, when it comes to this bill? Now, let's talk about the costly and dangerous expansion of the jail population that this bill will create. This bill would drastically increase the number of people held in local jails, exacerbating jail over population, a problem that has already proven deadly. In Fulton County in 2022 alone, at least 14 people lost their lives while detained in jail. And these deaths were preventable. In October study of the population of Fulton County jails revealed that 12% of the people detained were in jail, not because they posed a risk to public safety, but because they could not afford bail. Local governments are responsible for pre-joured attention costs. And SB 63, by increasing pre-trial detention, will force higher costs for cities and counties and expose local governmental bodies to costs associated with any litigation pursuant to jail overcrowding. When a person's liberty is in jeopardy, including through pre-trial detention, the due process principles of the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution are implicated. Substitutive due process requires that a government, a governmental infringement on liberty must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. According to the US Supreme Court, jailing a person solely because of their inability to supply a monetary payment violates the due process clause unless the person's ability to pay has been assessed. And there is a finding that such non-payment was willful or that no other means will serve the government's interest. This bill will harm poor people. This bill will create a two-tiered criminal legal system in the state of Georgia, one for those who can afford bond, and one for those who cannot. We cannot simply lock poor people up as a solution to building safer communities. You can look tough on crime, but when your constituents continue to face violence in their communities, know that you have failed them by failing to actually address the problems by the responsibility that we've been entrusted to pass good policy and the short run as well as in the long run to protect those who sent us here to serve them. Our criminal legal system already disproportionately impacts the poor, and SB 63 will only underscore that reality by leaving them to languish in jail. For the working poor to lose their home, shelter bed, job, and in some cases, their children, that's what this bill will do. It will exacerbate poverty in this state. All of this increases the cost to the state of Georgia, because not only will that daily cost to the county jail's increase, public financial support will be needed by many who eventually do get released from either jail or prison and return to their communities. Now, let's look through some of the amendments in this rule substitute to begin with. Striking out online 66, a felony offense of will open the door to requiring money bail for misdemeanor crimes beyond those already allowed in the family violence context. On lines 98 to 99, criminal trespass, even with second or subsequent offenses, may unnecessarily tax, again, the criminal legal system. To those who may be watching, this bill is restricting non-violent offenses, including a misdemeanor possession of marijuana on lines 107 to 108 of this bill. On lines 122 to 23, we are making the failure to appear in a second or subsequent offense, a bail restricted offense. This, our criminal legal system, the fact is our criminal legal system, our data is riddled with errors and omissions, which was reflected in the creation of SB 441 from last year. An extension of a commission, which was an extension of a commission, to troubleshoot and solve that problem. This bill not only limits judicial discretion, it will again continue to keep folks locked up in jail, which does not build safer communities. Now, let's look through some of the non-violent offenses, the non-violent crimes in which they would now be a bail restricted offense. Forgery, violation of oath of office, financial transaction, financial transaction, transaction cart theft, crimes that we get mad at, but crimes that will not harm people. Again, this bill will not, will not address the violence that we're facing today or create safer communities. Requiring court appearances on so many low-level, non-violent crimes will only further cripple a criminal legal system that's been so severely impacted by the pandemic and further perpetuate the current backlog. Last, let's look at section six, especially to my Republican friends and colleagues who care about civil asset forfeiture. Removing lines 205 to 210 from OCGA 17-672 subsection C.1 would allow bond forfeiture to proceed, even when the person's failure to appear in court was due to deportation or removal from the United States by federal authorities. Families who have put up secured bond, cash or property, will be subject to losing those assets if the federal government removes or deports a person for whom the bond was posted prior to the resolution of the related criminal case. Again, this is a bad bill. This bill does not promote public safety. This bill only criminalizes and exacerbates the poor in this state, who we, especially those who proclaim their faith down here often, that we've been commanded to serve and take care of and lift up. This bill does none of those things and will only move the state of Georgia backwards. For all these reasons, I strongly encourage this House to vote no to SB 63. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yoke the wall. Gentlemen, as you did the well, now those in favor have up to 30 minutes. Representative Anderson is recognized to speak to the bill. Representative Victor Anderson is recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I will take just a few moments. I want to bring a little different perspective to this bill. I'm not an attorney. Never pretended to be an attorney. But I am a former county commissioner and former chairman of the county commission. I do know that one of the, in a rural county in Georgia, one of the most common questions that we were asked when I was serving on the commission. And just as a side note, people in local counties think the county commission controls everything. Okay? So if you've served in that role, I think you'll agree with me. And I see a couple of heads nodding in here. But one of the most common questions we were asked is why are people who commit crimes allowed to just walk in and walk out with no skin in the game, with nothing to hold them in place or nothing to be concerned about. So with that in mind, for the people in rural Georgia who are looking to this body to try to answer those questions that they've had for years, I do encourage voting in favor of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield the bill. Gentlemen, as yielded well, Chairman Patry has recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I rise to a support this measure, of course, but I want to hone in very briefly on one section of this bill, section six. And if you look at section six, this section deals with conditions not warranting forfeiture of a bond. So there, you know, for lay folks that are not law exemptions, exceptions to forfeiture of bond. And what this measure does is eliminates, you'll see in lines 205 through 210, it eliminates section C1. Let me tell you what section C1 is. You're going to be surprised at this. It's basically special treatment. It's special treatment today in statute for those that are here in this country illegally who are bonded out and then are deported. Because right now, they're exempt from forfeiture of bond. And I want you to ask yourself, why should that be? Why should illegal immigrants be treated specially? And so we have a scenario today that actually incentivizes those who have committed a crime in Georgia and then are bonded out, who then are deported, who never serve trial in Georgia for the crime they committed on Georgians, we're incentivizing there being bonded out, because there is no forfeiture of bond. My friends, there's no logical reason why this should be in this statute. I'm glad it's being removed. It should be removed. Everyone I think commonsensically knows that to be true. And I hope that you'll support this, not only because of this provision, but all the provisions in this good bill. I hope that you'll all join me in voting in favor of this measure. And Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Gentlemen, has yielded the well. Chairman Collins is recognized as speak to the bill, Chairman Collins. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I don't come to the well very often to speak, but I want to take an opportunity to encourage every member of this body to support Senate Bill 63. You know, over and over again, we hear about the rights of criminals. We hear about, oh, this is going to disenfranchise a certain group of people. I submit to you that by passing House Bill or Senate Bill 63, we're going to protect people in this state. There are a very small group of individuals who want to plague our communities through criminal activity. The courthouse has become, or the jail has become a revolving door for a group of individuals. And we need to say no. We need to put a stop to this. And we need to speak up for victims of crime and stop people from becoming victims of this revolving door down at the county jail or at the city jail. It's absolutely ridiculous, in my opinion, that we even have to discuss this. There's so much that can be done to protect the public and keep people safe. And Senate Bill 63 is going to do that. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well and ask for everyone's favorable consideration to Senate Bill 63 to protect persons and property in this state. Thank you. Representative Maynors recognize the speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am going to be very quick for the people in District 56 at least. It's really important to what does the bill say? What does the bill say? What do the words on the paper say? And so if we go to line 20, it says, except as provided, the judge of any court of inquiry may, by written order, establish a schedule of bills, including local ordinances. The judge is deciding, not this piece of paper. The judge is deciding. Skip down to 24. Provided, however, that no bail schedule, local standing order, official policy, or local ordinance shall mandate, releasing, and accused on unsecured judicial release. Prior to the accused appearing before a judge, this is saying the accused must appear before a judge, one before the bill can be said or even released. Now what are the crimes that are listed in this bill that this bill is talking about? Do we want to release somebody that committed murder without bail? This is what's on the paper. Do we want to release somebody for kidnapping without bail, rape, child molestation, sodomy, assault, battery, carjacking? People are a carjacking in my community often. People in my community would be offended if we let somebody out for carjacking without bail, pimping, gangs, DUIs. If someone is driving under the influence, they don't need to bail. Should we be releasing them on bail? Family violence. Some of the other things added, stunt driving, drag racing, fleeing from police, bribery, forgery. What about exploitation of disabled persons? That was added. So we want to release people without bail after they are exploiting disabled persons and senior citizens, manslaughter, animal cruelty, racketeering, human trafficking, domestic terrorism, stalking, aggravated stalking. Those are the crimes that this particular bill is talking about. Next, let's look at 153 to 154. No person charged with the bail restricted offense shall be eligible for release by any judge on an unsecured judicial release. That was related to the murder, robbery, kidnapping, rape, child molestation, sodomy, assault, battery, carjacking, pimping, drug trafficking, gangs, DUIs, family violence, stunt driving, drag racing, fleeing police, bribery, exploiting, disabled persons and seniors, animal cruelty, violation of oath, domestic violence, racketeering, etc. Lines 163 to 168. It does say any person arrested for an offense who has previously been convicted for a felony within the preceding seven years. Let me tell you a personal story. So people in here know that I am a victim of stalking. Bolton County kept releasing the person that was stalking me. It got to the point and stalking is on this list. It got to the point where I had to contact the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Violence Against Women to say my county continues to release somebody that should not even have a bail. Now what other just lay citizen will go through those extremes, someone that wants to be protected for one and two, someone that knows that there are laws that people are supposed to be abiding by. I had to do the research myself. The lay person does not have the ability to do that. I had to research that myself called a U.S. Department of Justice because Bolton County kept releasing a person on bail that should not have been released on bail. Mr. Speaker, I yield the will. The lady has yielded the will. Here is any objection to the previous question being ordered. Chair has done the previous question is ordered. Okay. We have a minority report. Up to 20 minutes. I'll let you all know who signed up on the minority report. Minority report and we have Chair's time. You will be able to allocate the time appropriately amongst those who signed up. Representative Jasmine Clark, Representative Anne Allen Westbrook, Representative Shea Roberts, and Representative Al Wins. Representative Jasmine Clark is recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I rise to ask you all to vote no on SB 63. I want to talk about our justice system. So when you require cash bill, that is a system that favors those with means. Now to be clear, because a bunch of people have talked about being soft on crime, no one here is soft on crime. No one wants anyone to actually commit any crimes in our state or anywhere. In a perfect world, everyone would follow the rules all the time. Like for example, there's a rule that if you have a conversation, you should take it to the anti-room. But we got people in here talking right now. In a perfect world, people would follow the rules. In fact, rules would not even need to exist at all. But this is not a perfect world. And sometimes people make bad decisions and they break those rules. And when they do, there should be consequences. But our justice system is supposed to be set up where you are innocent until proven guilty. That is what we all believe. You are innocent until proven guilty. So however, is set before you have been found guilty of doing anything. When someone goes to jail prior to being convicted, they are technically according to our justice system incarcerated while innocent. Now for some egregious or violent crimes, I think it just makes logical sense that in the interest of public safety, people be jailed. But bail is actually an acknowledgement that we can't just imprison people forever without at least convicting them first. So with that acknowledgement, bail allows people to put money down to get out of jail. So if you're accused of a crime and you don't have money, you stay in jail. But if you do the same exact crime, the only difference between being behind bars and being home with your family is your bank account. Your bank account. It's that simple. The crafters of this bill argue that it is to combat soft on crime policies. But what they fail to mention is that rich criminals can get out of jail and they can get out of jail pretty easily. All they have to do is call mommy and daddy or the family attorney. And for some people, they don't even know what a family attorney is. Like that whole concept is foreign to them. But some people can just call the family lawyer to come down to the courthouse with the checkbook and get them out of there. So that's the big picture. Requiring bail, even for misdemeanors, is another example of criminalizing poverty. But let's get into the weeds. This bill adds to the list of bail restricted offenses, 31 new offenses. Some of those offenses would incarcerate people for things that are completely legal in other states. Seriously, y'all, possession of marijuana, are we really trying to keep people in jail for weed? With all the things we have to worry about, we took the time to make misdemeanor possession of marijuana a bail restricted offense in this bill. And just to remind you, the rich kid with a bag of weed will get out of jail in a couple of hours. It's the person with less means that may sit for a while. So I've heard a couple of people talk about victims. And so I'm just asking, I'm very curious, who exactly is the victim of possession of marijuana? What victim are we saving in that situation? Some of the things on that list just do not make sense. I also want to point out, because someone came in the well and mentioned that this bill would bail restrict people convicted of, or people accused of murder, kidnapping, rake, stalking, and things like that. This bill does not do that. You know why? Because that's already existing law. So that is not true. That is not what the bill does. If we're going to look at the words in a bill and talk about the words in the bill, let's understand that the only thing that this bill is doing is adding the lines that are underlying and striking the things that are struck. If it's not underlying a struck, it's already existing law. Those things were already bail restricted offenses. This adds new bail restricted offenses. And those offenses, some of which are ridiculous. We do not need to be doing this. This B63 is another bill that makes no logical sense. It's a campaign strategy. It's something that will say, oh, I was hard on crime while doing absolutely nothing for public safety. At the same time, we're going to overcrowd our jails. That's a problem that we already have. This won't fix that. We're going to invest millions of dollars in incarceration in our state cost less to educate than it does to incarcerate. But I don't see any bills that's actually trying to put more money into our education system. In fact, we got bills that are trying to take it away. Meanwhile, we're going to pass bills that are going to cost this state more and more money, local jurisdictions, more and more money to keep people in prison. This is a bad bill. Nothing in this bill is actually solving a problem. It is a solution looking for a problem. And with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield the rest of my time. Lady has yielded the well. Representative Ann Allen Westbrook is recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and good afternoon colleagues. I rise to speak against SB 63 because as applied and as written, it makes the bail system an unjust, two-tier system. Those who can afford bail get to leave and return to their families, jobs, homes and lives, and those who can't can't. This is despite the constitutional promise of innocent until proven guilty. Those who can't afford bail risk losing families, jobs, homes and quality of life. All the things we know help people thrive and avoid recidivism. And why is that important because we're talking about protecting life and property and recidivism puts those at risk again? SB 63 brings no guarantee of public safety simply because someone can't afford to get out of jail. Is there really a legitimate public safety basis for a determination that there isn't a single felony that isn't a bail restricted offense, even shoplifting or personal use controlled substance possession, or an offense involving someone with a serious and persistent mental illness who needs placement in a program? What does it mean that here in Georgia where we already have a guilty but mentally ill statute resulting in a mentally ill person being sentenced to someone who isn't, but with the caveat that they may get some sort of treatment if they're allocated funds? What does it mean that as we on the other one hand try to pass something like the Mental Health Parity Act? While we address the reality that sometimes the only way to get mental health treatment in Georgia is by getting a felony charge. My colleague, Rep Kinnerd, and speaking to, I think last week's tough on crime bill noted that the largest provider of mental health services in Georgia is still our jails and prisons. And if the person can't afford to get mental health care treatment, they are more than likely not going to be able to afford bail. So a fiscal analysis was done on SB 504 and much of it applies as well to the SB 63 language. And an example.

of that fiscal burden based on a data set obtained from my county sheriff's office revealed that people admitted to jail and their charges between July 15th, 2020 and October 1st, 2021 created a significant financial burden on our state. $74.51 to house someone in Chatham County jail per day. $6,546 total bookings. $1,099 of those were ordinance that charged at the city or county level, not a state misdemeanor. $5,447 bookings, 83.2% of our jail population then included misdemeanors and felonies. $4,941, excuse me, $4,941 of those charges were not considered bail restricted offenses. So in three categories of current non-bale restricted offenses that would become bail restricted under SB 63, they found a cost of on a typical bond told in Chatham County of 72 hours a total burden of $7,392,584. So I want to talk about some of the effects that SB 63 will have. In my county it's going to exacerbate understaff jails. In Chatham County we are so understaffed that the roughly 1200 detainees we have in our jail are currently on lockdown 23 hours a day. I'll also note that SB 63 does not make it clear how offenses like a fray, a.k.a. fighting are handled. So if a 17-year-old is charged with a fray for fighting in school, this means they get taken to jail and sit there as opposed to facing school disciplinary measures that were put in place for that specific purpose. Now if it's, I'll note like my colleague representative Kendrick, I'm a graduate of the UGA, University of Georgia School of Law, Class of 2001, and I'll note that my time in law school working for the Legal Aid Clinic was the sum total of my experience in criminal law. I was happy to move on to other areas of the practice when I graduated. But what we all learn if we learn nothing else about bail is that there is a specific constitutional purpose for bail and that is to ensure the presence of the defendant in court. Because innocent until proven guilty is a bedrock constitutional principle. This bill has nothing to do with that constitutional purpose. It is plainly punitive. And it will be unequal justice as my colleague, Rep. Kenner noted, it will disproportionately affect the poor, disproportionately affect black Georgians, and disproportionately affect mentally ill Georgians. So, in closing, I'll just note, I've now been here 40 days and I'm picking up on a few things. And one thing I'll note is that we think a lot of ourselves in this body, we know better than local judges hearing specific facts of specific cases. We know better than DAs. Again, reviewing specific facts of specific cases in specific communities. And we know better than local government too. I would argue that we could use a dose of humility in this body. Georgia is not New Yorker California. Georgia is not at risk of becoming New Yorker California. But we are very much at risk of moving backwards in this state. And SB 63 is just one more step in that process. One more rejection of the bipartisan, excellent legacy of Republican governor Nathan Deel. It's the wrong direction to move and I ask you to vote no on SB 63. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. The lady has yielded the well. Representative Roberts, she weighs. Representative L Williams has recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I was not in a hurry to come and speak to this bill. But a couple things certainly move for me to do it. One thing is, and I'm from a rural county. And some unintended consequences are attached to this bill. Violent criminals need to be dealt with and certainly bonds are appropriate. In the county I live, we've never had a problem that reaches the magnitude that I've heard here. And one of the things I hate is getting caught up in a lot of times, urban politics. I spent a lot of years dealing with the criminal justice system. Doing my years in the civil rights movement was sometimes on the other side of the fence. But I remember lawy out of Dublin, Georgia. Chairman's not in here right now. His first name was Josh and I can't remember his last name. But for his graciousness, I would have spent a lot more time on a very simple crime involved, following some picketing in Dublin. It came and got me out, not a cash mod. It bothers me that more and more we use the dog whistle. If we call the name California or New York, inspires people to rush to action. I happen to like the armors that come out of California and I enjoy the plays on Broadway. I happen to be a citizen of these United States. And I fear that we're spending too much time pitting states against states. Based on their decisions from an electoral standpoint, I have no business. Being involved with folk who mad with their current DA or mad with a judge in their current situation. This is about just angry that the judicial system has changed some, but that's for people at the ballot box that changed it. And it's not like it used to be. And I contend to you that a lot of kids, young people who get in trouble and rule Georgia, they don't even have to get to the recognition piece because they never make it to jail. They don't. That's the real deal. You just get to go home and your dad is called so you come down and pick them up and take them home. Unless you're not hooked up and got some contacts. That's difficult when you're outside of the hook up. I was at one time. I told folk I had more influence before I got here to this house of supposed influence. I was an honorary deputy in four counties. And I could pick up the phone and help folk. I did not help certain crimes. And victimless crimes don't call me and I gave my boys two talks, one of the talks were. Was that if you go to jail for robbery, you go to jail for sexual offense, you go to jail for the selling of narcotics, please don't call me because I'm not coming. But when you lose the compassion called a second chance, jail is too full of people who just never got a second chance because they didn't have the influence to wiggle around the system. In my county, we elected a new district attorney, whom I'm getting to know. And for the first time in recent years, he's in the wrong party, Mr. leader. I understand. But we wanted to show we'll elect a Republican every once in a while. Now he wouldn't elect it by leaving the county alone, by the way, because Representative House of Knows that might have not happened. But I trust the legal system. Sure, and district attorneys and judges in rural counties, this is how I can speak, but they know the population. Young person goes for a victimless crime, no violence. Why put the stain on their record that they're going to live with? I'm not angry with district attorneys. Every once in a while, I scratch my head at some of the decisions, but I trust the electorate. I really do. This is not a place for personal animosity. We too mad with too many people. People you're not afraid of don't need to be in jail. If you're mad with them, that's a personal problem. This is not the place to enact self-serving legislation. We have too much stuff here. And now we've started to act like because you might have a more liberal view over here, you should live in California. I beg your pardon. Georgia is a great state, but it also is number four in incursions in this entire United States. So we got a problem in locking people up we never had. But if you can't afford a good lawyer, or you're not hooked up at the courthouse, you stand a chance. I'm down to one minute. I hadn't had that done since I was in a high school play, but anyhow, actually you have 45 seconds. See your clock is wrong, Mr. Hemp. So I'm going to listen to the speaker. If you take your time, take my time as long as they are over 40 seconds. But I'm for you. Let's get back to the business of setting laws that help everybody and not singling out those who we disagree with. This is not the place. We have some pressing issues and we here want to lock Boo Boo up for a little bit of marijuana. He just needs to be taken home and if Boo Boo was coming home to me, he wouldn't have to worry about him being back in the system. But let's don't do this. Let's stop all of this division. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I like this light. You're turning on much too quick. That was 36 seconds that you turned it on with that, Mr. Speaker. I'll leave the well. Thank you, Representative Williams. He yielded the well. It's a very serious subject and we certainly all take it that way. That concludes the minority report. We'll now move on to the chairman's time. Up to 20 minutes. Chairman Tyler Paul Smith is recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I think that you probably time this outright to have a bad to speak right before lunch. So I will not be taking the full 20 minutes. Ladies and gentlemen, I rise in support of Senate Bill 63. We've had some good arguments on both sides about what the law does and doesn't do. I just mentioned about being bad. Let me tell you a little bit about what a Baptist Deakin at Corinth, Baptist Church said a young, impressionable man who just happened to be my father, gave him something best advice I'd ever heard in my life. Thankfully, father passed it down to me. Emory Hoyt Smith told my father that said, son, nothing good goes on after 11 o'clock at night. And I think all of us in this room probably found that out to be true to either by experience or seeing a friend of ours experience. You need to reflect on that. It was good advice coming up as a young man, especially even in rural Georgia, you know what folks get away with stuff. There's caught none. But you know, I was also reminded of what a minister said out in 29 Palm, California, a story that was relayed to me by my father when he was stationed there in Marine Corps. And these words have also resonated with me. He's told all this group of young Marines that there's a time when you got to walk away from trouble and a time when you got to run away from it. Now, this is not an adjudication of guilt. Nothing in here adjudicates anybody being guilty of a crime. But what all of us, all of us need to do is to help our young folks to understand that if you're on with dollars, you're going to get fleas. You might not be guilty of it, but you put yourself in these situations as good as something bad going to happen. You know, what I've heard today is again, what I alluded to, I believe it was last week, about falling humanity. And us having to make sure that we react, are falling into Prave World that we live in. I'm sorry y'all, that's what it is. And we had to react to it. I think the good Lord every day that he instituted good government like ours here in the state of Georgia. So we can deal with these problems. You know, on looking at this, you look at a lot of it and there were certain crimes that were pointed out. Notwithstanding whatever you may feel about marijuana, it's still against the laws of this state to have it, smoke it, and sell it. Until this legislature decides to take that off of the books, it's still a crime and eyes of this state. Don't do it. There are many issues that have been talked about here today. Let me just talk to you about the issue that I did not hear about. I see broken families across this state. I see people that are hard up. In my law practice, I help single mothers, single fathers every day that I'm back home. I'm having to help deal with this. But instead of us talking about this issue or that issue, let's see what we can do as a legislature about getting families back together. Let's have these conversations. A lot of these young folks do not have good parents at home. Some of them do, and they're doing the best they can. They're working nine to five or six to six, seven to seven graveyard shift. I get it. But there are some other issues we have not discussed here today that have led us to this point. Let me just tell you something about bond. I appreciate the comments about poor people and rich people. I've been there before. But let me tell you about this. The judge in their discretion, we're talking about taking away discretion, they do still have discretion under this bill. Under their discretion, somebody with money, the judge can stick it to them on the bond amount, or like they're doing here in the metro area, set a bond for a quarter. They can do that. Plain and simple, nothing in this legislation prohibits them from setting bond as chairman gains noted at a penny. Here's the thing. There has to be accountability as I spoke to you about last week, we've got to make sure that we hold those accountable. Hold the young folks accountable for making sure that they're keeping good company. You've got to emphasize that. So Mr. Speaker, with that, I'm not going to blame the point anymore, but I'm going to yield this well and ask this body's favorable consideration on Senate bill 63. The gentleman has yielded the well. That concludes all of the discussion on the bill. Is there any objection to withdrawing the committee's substitute? Chair, here's none. The committee's substitute is withdrawn. Is any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules? Chair, here's none. The rules committee's substitute is adopted. Is any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the past of the bill? Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. For what purpose does Representative Mary Francis Williams, I'm sorry. Mary Francis Williams drives. Parliamentary question. State your inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that it is unfortunate that given the seriousness of this issue and the complexity of this legislation that at no time were members of this body allowed to ask questions of the author or other folks? I respect the opinion, Lady States, but we did thoroughly debate the issue. Further inquiry? State your inquiry. Is it not true that the questions that I wanted to ask related to specific charges that have been added? One of them was possession of marijuana which has been spoken of a lot during debate. One that has not been addressed is the one of unlawful assembly. Is it not true that often unlawful assembly is interpreted very different according to the law enforcement on the scene? If the ladies so states I'm sure she's thoughtfully thoughtfully and compassionately thought about that. You have a further inquiry? Is it not true that in my city, City of Marietta, that if someone is taken in and bond has to be posted, there is no space often in the county jail. I don't think we have a city jail anymore and they've been taken people to the Spurn a jail. Often because of and is it not further true that often due to all of the work that our law enforcement folks have to do that they can't even get to posting bond for someone until possibly the next morning. I'm sure the lady knows what she speaks. I'll take one more inquiry. Is it not true that as a single mother, I did the best I could as a mom and I didn't do the greatest job that I could at perhaps. Didn't have a dad in it within a thousand miles but is it not true that sometimes parents find their children doing things they wouldn't want them to do regardless of what time it is and how much we may have worked to get them to go the other direction. If the lady so states this chair sure she was a good mother. For what purpose is representative Roberts rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State you inquiry. Isn't it true that our current law already requires judges to confirm that an accused person will not create a substantial risk to public safety before they can release them and isn't it further true that the only people who will benefit from this bill are the bondsman and isn't it further true that this is yet another bill where we are telling duly elected judges that we know how to do their job better and isn't it further true that this will be one more unfunded mandate on our counties and cities because they will bear the cost of having to unnecessarily lock up more accused, not convicted Georgians and finally isn't it true in light of governor deals legacy that it's unfortunate that this is partisan and only Democrats are opposing well not only Democrats we have a few and Republicans are supporting it thank you mr. if the lady so states I'm sure she passionately believes everything she just stated I'm taking one more parliamentary inquiry I have a several them but we've debated this bill for quite some time and it's been around for some time so I'm going to recognize and ask what purpose does rips any but now rise parliamentary inquiry state your inquiry is it not true mr. speaker that a lot of those children who have money come into the neighborhoods where other children who don't have a lot of money and can't afford an attorney and that's where they come and purchase their drugs is it not true if the lady so states I'm sure she has some insight into that have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill the yeas were 95 the nays 81 the bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed for what purpose does ripples in a park can arise to make a motion state your motion I move that this body reconsider its action on that most recent measure now is a time for the lady to pursue the motion if she so desires does the lady move I do own the latest motion to the house reconsider this action and giving sb 63 the requisite majority the time the vote this is right now within the last three days all those in favor reconsideration will vote yes all those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines you have all members voted have all members voted it's so so the clerk will lock the machine on the lady's motion the yeas are 76 the nays are 100 the motion is lost and the house is failed reconsidered section sb 63 has passed we have a group of privileged resolutions that the members have submitted we're going to move to those privileged resolutions now this will enable you to get a pretty copy of your resolution before you leave here so you can take back home and present to the appropriate person so mr. clerk where you read the caption to a group of privileged resolutions honoring the life and memory of mr.

objection to adopting the privileged resolutions. Chair here's none and the resolutions are adopted. Thank you members. As you all know we've worked very hard this session to move legislation along and not try to have it pile up on us on day 40. So we're going to continue with that as we take up from further actions that will hopefully get us out of here before too late tonight. That is my goal. Chairman Newton has recognized for a motion. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I move that the house agreed at the Senate substitute as amended by the House on House Bill 230. Chairman Newton moves at the House agreed to the Senate substitute to House Bill 230 as amended by the House. Mr. Clerk will you read the caption. House Bill 230 by Representative Newton in the 127th and others to be titled next to amend chapter 8. It's out of 48. The fish go to George Annettator relating to sales and use taxes so to provide for a qualified consolidated government special purpose local option sales tax. Chairman Newton is recognized to explain the Senate substitute and the House amendment. Thank you Mr. Speaker. House Bill 230 this body passed with 165 votes and it was it is allowing on our border county over Augusta Richmond County to build a regionally significant arena. A lot of the benefit goes across the river into South Carolina. House Bill 230 allowed a half penny sales tax because they do a lot of the shopping over in Georgia. It allows that burden or benefit to be paid for partially by people out of state that will benefit from the arena. So we passed that with 165 votes. The Senate did add a cap on it for the cost of the project. What our amendment allows for though in the house is to make sure that we in the bond that we can have the interest that would be on that project is well covered. So our amendment just clarifies that the Senate the Senate's cap on the project will include the interest when the bond is issued. General you have four questions. Certainly yes sir. We'll part to your left. Thank you Mr. General's recognize. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Chairman could you speak to some of the concerns raised in the Senate. I see here that there were 11 Republican senators who voted against this bill. Certainly I'm glad to ask a good question. There were there are some who really we have different types of sploshtagreements that go to property tax reduction some for special projects. This deals with the consolidated government and in particular with the fact that we're on a state border that would allow once again the those who are benefiting across the state border to actually participate in paying for the project. And so there were some people who disagree with that process. Does it gentlemen you'd for one additional question. Certainly. Would the House amendment in any way alleviate those concerns or do you think they'd still have those outstanding concerns. No I believe a number of the senators have expressed that they're okay with the project now but I couldn't guarantee that all of them would change their mind.
