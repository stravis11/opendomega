as well. We have a very special guest with us today. I know he's very special to the
senator that will be introducing him. So, and I recognize the senator from the 10th
to introduce, to lead us in our pleasure legents and introduce our pastor of the day.
Thank you, Mr. President. I'll stand and pledge allegiance to the flag.
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic of
And now to Georgia Flag, I pledge allegiance to Georgia Flag in front of all of you who
stand.
Please give justice for our worship.
Good morning and it is one of those moments when you have an opportunity to do something
that you know just kind of resonates in your spirit and in your soul. Today, I have an opportunity
to introduce my son who is our pastor of the day. Elim Jones who is a young 30 years old
got ordained when he was 21 years old in the Baptist faith by my pastor in MacDonald Georgia.
He's since gone on to do great things with his life and just to share a few of those things.
And I would try not to get choked up because he is an exceptional young man.
And not only is Elim an exceptional young man, but he is an exceptional pastor as well.
Well, Elam currently attends Harvard University.
He's studying for his, he's gotten his master's
independent from Harvard.
He got his, he's currently studying for his
doctorate independent from Harvard.
And he's also in the law school of Harvard University
up in Boston.
When I'd say it's exceptional, he really is an
exceptional young man.
21 years that I've served in his body, my kids have
literally grown up with me in this chamber.
And I can say to all of you that when your time comes
and you look back on those moments,
I just pray that you'd never ever forget
the experience, not just that you had in this body,
but also the experience that your family had as well.
Elam is joined by members of my family
and I'm taking the liberty, Mr. President.
I do apologize, but my daughter who is the doctor today,
She's in Portland, Oregon at the National University
of Natural Medicine.
I'm also joined by my son's wife, Miss Asia Jones,
who is studying her PhD at Berkeley, California,
and I understand Cal Berkeley she has one more year
to complete her PhD in psychology and sociology.
And I'm honored that my matriarch of our family,
my aunt, Janelle, who was gracious enough
to come up here and join my two kids
as they are featured here today.
And this moment would not have been possible
without my sister who stands right next to my aunt.
And one of the things that we all have shared growing up
is a closeness in our family.
I always say to people that we didn't have much,
but we always had each other, and that's all we need.
Please join me in welcoming my son, Helum Jones,
our pastor today.
To Lieutenant Governor Jones and to the Honorable Emanuel Jones, who graciously invited me to speak
in this chamber once more, and to the members of the Georgia State Senate and all who have
gathered today. It is both a privilege and an honor to address you this morning. I'd like
to take up a word from the Lord found in the book of Micah, the sixth chapter, verse 8, and
the story that unfolds in the pages directly preceding it. This places us within a narrative
set long after the division of the land of ancient Israelites into the Northern Kingdom
of Israel and Judah to the South, following a long period of relative peace, both kingdoms
along with surrounding nations found themselves facing increasing pressure from powerful and
rapidly expanding neighboring empires.
The book further locates us in a small town in the South, where the prophet Micah, serving
as a messenger of God delivers a powerful and piercing message to the kingdom's leaders.
Accusing them of a massing wealth through theft and intimidation, he condemns the deep
injustices that have taken root in their society, where bribery governs the land.
This is twisted to favor the wealthy and the poor are robbed of their property, their
security, and their hope.
As Micah declares, these are the kinds of profound systemic wrongs that have left unchallenged
in any nation where the thousands of years ago or today were surely destroyed both the
land and its people.
He goes on to reveal that the severity of this corruption is made even worse by Israel's
own prophets, who have fallen prey to greed and dishonesty.
These social commentators and political pundits of the day, no longer speaking truth and
love, have turned their sacred role into a business.
They promise divine protection for anyone who can afford it.
Micah makes it unmistakably clear, God has withdrawn his protection, the divine favor that
one shielded the nation has been lifted, and the consequences of their corruption are
now unavoidable.
However all is not lost.
Through a beautiful series of poetic promises about the future, Micah speaks of the hope
they can still be found that the people choose to reform their ways.
And his now famous words, Michael declares in verse 8,
he has shown you, O mortal, what is good and what does the Lord require of you to act
justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God, justice, mercy, and humility.
Visionary social activists and co-founder of the Catholic social worker movement, Dorothy
day dedicated her life to serving the poor, advocating for peace, and fighting for social
justice through direct action. Her tireless commitment to living out the teachings of
her faith in the most challenging circumstances earned her a unanimous recommendation for
canonization as a saint in 2012. The highest honor in the Catholic Church but had Dorothy
been alive, she likely would have refused it. In fact, Dorothy was often quoted for saying,
don't call me a saint. I don't want to be dismissed so easily. As she saw it, the everyday exercise
of justice, mercy, and humility, in her case recycling food from a dumpster, sleeping on a stinky
prison floor and going to mass every afternoon
should not be reserved for the exceptional among us.
In her words, we are all called to be saints
in the priesthood of the lady.
Likewise, I stand here today to remind all of you
in this room that you are all called to be change makers
and the legislature of Georgia.
This responsibility is not reserved only
for the boldest among you, or for the most idealistic,
but for each and every one of you.
In a time that features many of the injustices
experienced by Micah many centuries ago,
it is all of you who we rely upon to set an example
and to ensure that we are on the proper course.
As the late President Jimmy Carter once said,
The way to enhance freedom and prosperity in other lands,
be it abroad or just north in our nation's capital,
is to demonstrate here that our democratic system
is worthy of emulation.
So just as Micah asked of the ancient Israelites long ago,
I conclude by asking you to do justice,
and to love mercy, and to walk humbly
with the God of your understanding.
Let us pray.
Dear Lord, thank you for the members of this assembly.
I ask that you always be present with them,
their families, and those they represent.
Guiding them to make good, wise, and ethical decisions
on behalf of all who live in Georgia
and reminding each one of their calls to be change-makers
in the spirit of justice, mercy, and humility.
I pray this in your name.
Amen.

to recognize the senator from the 38th to introduce our doctor of the day senator.
All right good morning colleagues. I am very excited to once again welcome back Dr. John Gleason to the Senate.
He is racking up his points here in the Senate as he is a frequent doctor of the day here.
So very excited to have him.
He's an orthopedic surgeon at Resurgence Orthopedics, resident of Atlanta and graduate of McNeese State
University in Louisiana and got his medical degree from Louisiana State University.
I am going to be short on this because we're going to have him back here this week and so
I'm very pleased to welcome Dr. John Gleason
as our doctor of the day.
Thank you all.
Thank you for your hard work,
and I know y'all got a busy week,
and Friday will be a glorious day,
and as Senator Kemp stated,
if I make it down here one more time,
I get to be his concierge doctor.
Thank you.
You
Jones from the 10th he brought all his a lot of it not all of them, but a lot of his distinguished children down here and and one
young lady behind me is
Doctor soon be Dr. Jones and
I just wanted to recognize her because she will be being the
Doctor of the day very very soon. We weren't able to get her today, but we're going to recognize her anyway
Hi, good morning everyone. My name is Yvmani Sutton. I am a graduate of Vanderbilt University
and currently I'm a third year medical student at the National University of Natural Medicine
in Portland, Oregon. So, Natural Pathetic Medicine, it's not well known here but it's a holistic
approach to medical care. That emphasizes natural therapies, prevention and supporting the
body's ability to heal itself.
So currently I'm learning conventional medicine
and combination with more natural modalities.
So that includes herbal medicine, homeopathy,
and physical medicine.
Currently there are 26 jurisdictions,
including DC and Puerto Rico, that
have licensure for naturopathic physicians.
And currently there are 17 states that
they're pushing for legislation for licensure.
And Georgia is on neither of those lists yet.
So today I'm hoping to spread some awareness
of naturopathic medicine if you have any questions.
I would encourage you to reference naturopathic.org.
That's in ATUR-OPATHIC.org, where you can talk to me after this.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Are there any unanimous consents?
Does any senator withdraw on a point of personal privilege?
We're going to have a senator from the 8th.
Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Today is a special day in our family because my son, J.R.,
who's in the chamber with us, turns 21 today.
today. And let me tell you, you all know about 10 years ago, he was electrocuted in the
swimming pool when a friend of mine says if what he's seen the movies is true, that J.R.
should have superpowers. But he's certainly one of my heroes. I have a
commendation here from the governor for J.R. Says John Reston Goodman is a proud
Georgia citizen who celebrates his 21st birthday on March 31st, 2025 and
where has an eighth-generation South Georgia farmer,
John has received multiple state and national FFA awards
for diversified agricultural proficiency,
and whereas he is a lifelong UGA superfan,
and is currently a junior at the University
studying agricultural economics.
He's a member and passed Vice-Nobal Rule
of Alumni Relations of Alpha Gamma Row Agricultural
Ferturnity, and whereas he is the son of a state-centered
with an interest in public service himself,
he has further offered his talents to the state of Georgia
through an internship at the State Capitol,
the Georgia Agor Business Council during the spring 2025
legislative session.
And whereas John is truly a great American
and a damn good dog, and it is an honor to recognize him
on his 21st birthday and to wish him well
and all his future endeavors now, therefore,
I, Brian P. Kemp, Governor of the State of Georgia,
do by here by command, Mr. John Rustin Goodman.
JR, we love you, buddy.
Proud of you.
And thank you, Mr. President, for allowing me the opportunity.
I yield the whale.
Thank you, Mr. President.
A good friend of mine is sitting up in the gallery.
A father, a leader, and a great man.
I want to honor John Cohen upon his induction
in the Roswell High School Hall of Fame
and the Georgia Dugout baseball Hall of Fame.
For over six decades, 60 years,
John has embodied the heart of leadership, humble,
impactful, and always putting others before himself.
Through his dedication, he has shaped the lives
of countless young men, not only as an exceptional coach
coach but also as a mentor and a strong male role model. In a world where humble
leadership is needed more than ever. John's example stands as a testament to the
true power of servant leadership. Congratulations John and thank you for your
remarkable leadership we're all better for it. I yield the one.
Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to have here visiting representatives from the City of Brunswick.
They have a very nice bill on our consent calendar for a new home set exemption for the homeowners in Brunswick, Georgia
But if I might I'd like to recognize my believe there up here to my left in the gallery. I have Mayor Cosby Johnson
Most of you know Cosby from his work with the state chamber. I have Mayor Pro Tem, Felicia Harris
I have two commissioners, Commissioner Gwen Atkinson-Williams, and Commissioner Kendra-Roll.
They have some family members with them, and they're representative Tyler Lewis, so welcome folks from Brunswick.
We appreciate you.
Give them a hand.
Thank you, Mr. President, and you're all the well.
I'm very excited today to recognize someone that everybody in this room knows, a dear friend
of mine for over 24 years, Lynn Riley.
it is bittersweet to commemorate your extraordinary service as you retire after all your selfless
sacrifice. I remember when I first met Lynn all those years ago she was kind enough to sit
on the board of one of my companies and then I remember when she told me she was going to run for
the Fulton County Commission and we started putting signs up my first time putting signs in the ground
followed by her great service there we were both elected at the state time to the General Assembly
where she served in the State House of Representatives and was one of Governor Deal's four leaders.
She was then tapped by Governor Deal to move on to several important positions.
In fact, she was the first female to serve as a Georgia State Treasurer and the Georgia State
Revenue Commissioner. In her current role, though, she awarded $4.3 billion to her 459,000 students
through the Holt Scholarship Program and has worked very closely with Governor Kemp and played
a vital role in creating the Georgia Match Program where the largest one run direct missions,
programs, and most successful in the entire country. Lin's accomplishments are extraordinary
in her 21 years of service, but I know her well and sitting next to her, her husband Mike,
her children and boy she is one wonderful doding grandmother who is put her
values right in the proper place so ladies and gentlemen I ask everyone in
the Senate to please rise and give a rounding applause to Lynn Riley.
Thank you.
We have a special group with us here today, my good friend Jim Cole and his athletic director
down at Mercer University and his daughter Caroline is with us today who's in law school
there she but she worked several years here in the Senate both for my office and
also Senator Brass or Senator from the the rules chairman's office and did a
good job but we have today with us the football coach and a couple of players
where I can tell you right now these these boys at Mercer the Mercer Bears they
they're not afraid to play anybody they'll go to Tuscaloosa they'll go to
Auburn Alabama they they even want to go to Athens Georgia but Athens won't
So we're going to have to get him, we're going to get on coach smart about that, but we just want to recognize them and what a fine job that Jim Cole and his, his group were doing down at Mercer and just, you know, just talk about brag on them a little bit on what they're doing and everything, the young student athletes that they're putting out down at that school in Macon, Georgia and to talk more about it, I'll recognize the, the protein from, from Macon.
Senator from the 18th.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Good morning, colleagues.
You know, I rise today to, with some great pride to recognize the team as the President
just spoke of.
It's got grit, discipline, and heart, and it captured not only our attention, but also
a Southern Conference title.
I'm talking about none other than the Mercer Bears football team, who delivered an outstanding
2024 season this past year, finishing with an impressive 11-3 overall record and securing
a Southern Conference Championship with a seven-to-one conference record.
Led by the first-year head coach, Mike Jacobs, who's with us up here, led the bears and
showed what determination and leadership looks like, not only on, but also off the field.
They advanced to the NCAA division, won FCS playoffs, and competed all the way to the
quarterfinals, proving that Macon's not just about good music and history, but also some
championship football.
Now, let's talk about some dominance.
The team went on to be undefeated at home with a 7-0 record at 5-star stadium, and the
Bears gave their fans a real season to remember.
On the floor, so many of y'all recognized Jim Cole behind us at the president recognized
you.
Remember, some of you that have been here a while at Jim Cole's service over in the house
for many years.
Mike Jacobs, the first-year head coach that we're proud to have at Mercer, Isaac Dowling,
the team captain, and then Riley Adcock, coach Jacobs, you have built something special
in your very first year at Mercer and this Senate is very proud to recognize you.
Y'all give a warm welcome for the Mercer Bears football team and I'll ask the coach if he wants to say something.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Good morning. We appreciate everybody having us here.
This is a tremendous honor to not only represent Mercer, but the city of Macon
and really fortunate for the strong leadership at our university, President Bill Underwood
and certainly our athletic director, Jim Cole,
who many of you know.
But really, all the thanks go to our players
and we have some tremendous ones behind us,
some bears that are getting ready
to graduate and move on in the world,
but they've accomplished quite a bit in their time with us.
Riley was a 50 game starter for us.
He's the top engineering student
in the Civil Engineering program at Mercy University.
Isaac also started over 40 games for Mercer football
and we're trying to get him one more year right now.
So we really appreciate this.
This is quite an honor for us to be standing before you today
and on behalf of all of Mercer and Macon,
we appreciate you all.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
You
I see one of our former members, Senator Mitch C. Balls here today.
Let's give Mitch a big round of applause.
Good to have you Mitch.
And see if you can do something with the senator from the six over there.
I know you've been a mentor to him.
Thank you, Mr. President, colleagues, I'm going to share with you a short history lesson
and a trivia question.
In honor of the Center from the 21st,
I wanna make you aware of how Washington, DC
became Washington, DC.
My name is Burns.
We trace our family back to Scotland,
to the Burness clan, which means by a stream or a brook,
a burn, it's changed the name of the spelling several times,
you are NES, was the spelling at the time that Washington DC was created.
My great-great-great-great-grandfather was David Burns.
He inherited what is now Washington DC from his grandfather, a first-generation immigrant
Scotsman.
Burns served as a second lieutenant in the first Maryland Brigades of the Continental Army
in the Revolutionary War.
After the war, Burns and his family lived in a cottage in what is now the National Mall.
In the late 18th century, Burns and 14 other landowners negotiated with George Washington
to sell their land to the government for the creation of what is now the city of Washington
DC.
President Washington commonly referred to Burns as the obstinate Mr. Burns.
For a shrewd and bold negotiating style, Burns and Washington and other landowners came
to turn in terms in 1791, completing the sale.
The former Burns Land, it was 600 acres on the Potomac River on Potunt River, includes
all our part of what is now the White House, the Treasury Building, the Eclipse, the Washington
Monument, and most of the Washington Mall.
In subsequent years, the Burns family changed their spelling to B-U-R-N-S.
Some of them moved to Georgia and I was one of those.
So, here's the history lesson.
This is the oldest cottage in Washington, D.C. the Burns cottage.
And the trivia question is, when someone says, where did Washington receive the land
to create Washington, D.C. it was the Burns farm.
Thank you, Mr. President, I yield a well.

They're in Dulles Old Chairman.
They complete the order.
Mr. President.
We're going to sit in front of the 29th.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Good morning, everybody.
It's been a while.
House Bill 116 does two things.
The primary thing is it changes the name
of the Motor Care Compliance Enforcement Section
government of public safety to commercial vehicle enforcement.
These are the men and women that you see in the dark SUVs moving up and down the interstate
on our highways that make sure that all the 18 wheelers and commercial trucks that you
see out there are compliant with Georgia law.
What it also does is it ensures that the members of the commercial vehicle enforcement group
will be trained, sworn, and certified.
For anyone who may not know the individuals
that do the inspections and the other things
related to commercial vehicles have to have a very unique
skill related to these vehicles specifically
that some law enforcement officers do not,
which is why we have concerns from time to time
with agencies pulling over these vehicles.
Simple traffic violations, title 40 violations are easy enough,
but some of the things related to inspections
and other things related to the commercial vehicles
themselves can be somewhat complicated.
And with that, Mr. President, I will yield for any questions.
You do have one question, Senator.
I recognize Senator from the 53rd.
I thought I did.
Thank you, Mr. President, with the Senator Yeal.
I do Yeal.
It's true that if your bill passes CVD officers,
they get dispatched to the same riots
and everything else in a blue shirt,
would you dispatch to right? That's right these I think my good friend from the
53rd thinks a lot like I do that if you if you have the training and if you
have the skill set the dedication and you work like other law enforcement agencies
do you should be treated exactly the same and these officers do respond to
those same types of situations therefore parity should be throughout the
Department of Public Safety and I think this helps get us closer to that goal
Senator would that agreeance of parity would you be in favor of signing on to the
legislation from the senator from the second nod to bring in medical
retirement for the black shirt and the blue shirts together. Senator I would
I would consider that absolutely doing that the only thing that makes me
nervous about that is that it is you from the 53rd and the senator from the
second and I'm afraid I might be walking into a fly trap but after reading and I
I would take that into consideration.
Senator, isn't it true that the Senator from the 53rd
is the most pro-law enforcement Senator in this chamber?
No, sir, that is not true.
With that, Mr. President, I yield the well.
Senator's yielded.
Does any other Senator wish to speak for against the measure?
Hearing none.

Mr. President, the Senate Committee on Higher Education recommends that this bill do pass by substitutes
the submitted Senator Hickman-Cherman.
Mr. President, the Senate Committee on Higher Education offers to long substitute the House Bill 150,
Bill's being titled an act to amend part two of Article 2, Chapter 3, Title 20,
those that you able to the university system, so it's to require semi-annual reports regarding certain
funding received from foreign countries, entities, or individuals of concern,
by pedestrian denisions, the right for related matters,
right for short tile, through repeal,
complicating laws, and for other purposes.
Mr. President, Senator Beaton of the 30th,
and others are for the following amendment number one
to amend the Senate Committee's substitute of House
with 150 by striking $50,000 online,
$28,000 and inserting $1,000.
Mr. President, that completes the order.
We're going to have a center from the 45th.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Colleagues, I rise today to present HB150 to you.
bill ensures that the legislature understands what our university system is doing in regards to
countries with foreign concerns and institutions
funding that might present corruption influence of our university system.
At the same time it ensures that individuals from foreign nations who want to study here
can do so in peace. The two key opponents to the bill are focusing on funding from foreign
countries of concern and those working on their behalf. It applies to foreign entities
of concern who are governments, companies, and people without U.S. residency or citizenship
who live in these countries. This foreign countries of concern are identified in lines 16-18.
These governments are designated by the United States Secretary of Commerce. The second
part it promotes transparency in foreign funding you do have one question I'm sorry
Senator I'm glad somebody else can't either because I couldn't either so I think
And I need to turn up the mic a little bit.
And that's what the bill does.
If you would please vote, then I'll yield well.
I'm just kidding.
All right, now I'll go ahead and start over.
Thank you for letting me know that.
So colleagues, I rise today to bring HB-150 before you today.
This bill ensures that the legislature understands what our university system is doing
in regards to countries that are affluent concern and institutional funding that might
present corruption or influence on our university system.
The bill does two things, it's focused on funding from foreign countries of concern
and those working on their behalf.
It applies to those countries
and basically where that foreign countries of concern,
where that comes from, is from the United States.
Secretary of Commerce, and that's where that list is derived from.
What this bill does is it promotes transparency.
It requires a university system to report twice a year
to the governor and to this body of any funding
that has been received by any university,
50,000 and above from foreign countries of concern.
It does not contemplate or include tuition.
It has nothing to do with that.
We want individuals from all over the world
to be exposed to the benefits of our US higher education system
and the freedoms of our society.
What we don't want is to see hostile foreign adversaries
use money to undermine or corrupt our university system.
research or to steal intelligence and things of that nature.
Will that Mr. President be happy to answer any questions?
And there is a friendly amendment that would actually drop
that amount from $50,000 to $1,000.
Yeah.
You do have a couple of questions.
And if I get everybody's attention,
the skin is getting pretty loud back there in the back.
And it is having a hard time.
We're all having a hard time here in the gentleman
in the well.
So if y'all could break it down a little bit.
If you've got house members you're talking to, maybe take them outside and talk to them there.
So, Senator from the 44th.
Thank you, Mr. President, to the author, will you, or the sponsor, will you, you'll, great
to appreciate you starting again.
Oh, absolutely.
So this, the foreign countries of concern, I'm looking at lines 16 to 18, would this list
update automatically, pursuant to any changes to 15 CFR, section 791.4, or will it be static
based on the list on February 4th, 2025?
Senator, the way I read it would be the list that was established or current on February
4th, 2025.
So meaning, your interpretation is that it remains static.
Yes, ma'am.
Do you have any concerns that then it could kind of quickly get out of date and be over
inclusive to the, maybe it wouldn't be quickly, but say, and you know, however many years,
over inclusive to the point that we may inadvertently block talented individuals from being a part
of our university system whose research we actually might very much want to take advantage
of as Americans?
What are your thoughts on that?
Yeah, and I completely see your point, Senator.
And I could also see the list, you know, at some point need to be updated.
You might need to take somebody off or add somebody, but a country may take a country
off.
We may add a country down the road.
The intent of the bill is not students, you know, coming from abroad to learn at our
university system.
It's, you know, countries that are of concern contributing, you know, large amounts of money
to these universities and potentially having influence over them.
Thank you. Do you, if you'll further yield, do you know why the decision was made to keep
that static instead of updating along with the federal code?
I do not have the answer to that.
Lastly, I don't think this is a part of this current bill, but I know that we have had
a number of bills over the last three years or so regarding ownership of land near certain
areas, certain sensitive American, I don't know, can't recall if there were like utilities
or other other things of that nature, is this the same sort of approach that those bills
have taken?
Yeah, I would say similar, I think, you know, what you're looking here is it, you know,
as you, you know, the numbers debated, you know, is $1,000 or $50,000, you know, it's the
large donations that would potentially give them access, you know, to the university
through, you know, you know, having access to coming to meetings or, you know, being
involved in a university wouldn't be an individual student coming over and paying to
tuition to access one of our university system.
Thank you.
You have one more question, Senator.
We're going to send it from the 41st.
Thank you, Mr. President.
This is Senator Yield.
I do, yes, ma'am.
Thank you.
You continue to talk about this not excluding, say,
foreign exchange students.
But if you look at line 23, it defines
a foreign individual of concern as anyone who's
from one of those countries that is not a citizen
or permanent resident of the United States.
So can you help me understand how that would preclude
or carve out, say, an international student?
Yeah, I would imagine, I mean,
it wouldn't be any student coming from, say, China's
a hot button country, coming from China.
This would be the individual that obviously is,
you know, of concern that has done something to put them on that list.
Do you further you know?
Sure.
So you're suggesting that the person has to have done something
and cannot just be domiciled from that foreign country,
but they have to actually have done something to get on the list
individual concern you are correct yeah it would be if they're
domicile that's correct so do you further you know sure you've also suggested
that paying tuition would not be a part of this however on lines 26 and 27 it
talks about funding means payment and exchange for services or other
monetary exchange. So it's a very broad, very, very broad category here. So I'm not
understanding how it is that tuition would not be included in this
exclusion.
I do agree it is a broad definition, but it doesn't have tuition, you know,
have lifted in there, but I agree it is broad.
So just isn't it true that if we were to pass this bill
a student from China who is not a permanent resident
in the United States and is not a citizen
would be considered a foreign individual of concern
and therefore could not pay any money
to our university system because that
would be a monetary exchange.
And therefore we are essentially banning
all international students from China from being able to receive an education or continue
to further our research here in our university systems. Isn't that true?
No, I don't believe that's the intent of the bill at all, not to ban all foreign students.
for the year.
No, Mr. President, I'll yield the well on that.
Thank you.
All right.
Senator Hesilden.
Senator from the A's, would you like to speak?
Senator from the 30th, would you like to speak to your amendment?
Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you to my friend from District 45 for seeing this
as a friendly amendment.
Any time we're talking about foreign countries, entities, or individuals that are designated
for an adversary to the United States, I really don't think we should be accepting any
money from these individuals, but we are reducing that amount from $50,000 to $1,000, that
way we know exactly what's coming into our universities, and with that, Mr. Speaker,
I ask that you vote in favor of the amendment and the bill, and I will yield the well.
Senator Hesildan.
Does any other senator which speak for against measure?
Chair, here's none.
Is there objections previous question being ordered?
Chair, here's none.
Previous question is ordered.
On the adoption of amendment number one.
We have objection.
On adoption of amendment number one,
from the center, from the 30th,
we have objection to that amendment.
Senator, would like to speak to your objection
or just let it ride.
Just let it ride, all right.
All those in favor of amendment number one
will vote yay, all opposed,
nay, secretary, and lamp machine.
On the adoption of amendment number one, the A's are 32, the A's are 21, and the amendment
is adopted.
Questions on the adoption?
Questions on the adoption of the committee's substitute, as amended, is there objection
to the adoption of the committee's substitute as amended?

On the pass of the bill, the A's are 32 and the A's are 19, this bill haven't received
the requisite constitutional majority, it's therefore passed by substitute.
Secretary House bill 199.
House bill 199, representative Kelly, the 16th and others, the bill is being said to
to manage, I provide a title 15 of the official code of Georgia annotated,
led to administration of courts and record generally.
So it's the modified provisions related to protection of personal identifiable information
of judges and their spouses to abolish the requirement for the administrative office
of the courts to maintain a database of protected persons and information,
so by a protected statewide form, to be used by protected persons seeking to have information
removed or a doctor from public records to require state and law governments to remove personally
identifiable information from public records were requested by protected persons,
for procedures for such requests,
to rise definitions, to regulate matters,
to be able to look at laws and for other purposes.
Mr. President, the thank-and-menegetary
recommends that this bill do pass
by substitute respectfully submitted
to Senator Strickland-Chairman.
Mr. President, the thank-and-menegetary
offers the long substitute to House Bill 199
to build some means out of mind to manage
I provide a title for the dean of those
to GA, related to administration of courts
and record generally says some modified provisions
related to protection of personal identifiable
information of judges and their spouses
and for other purposes.
Mr. President, that completes the order.
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the Senate, Senate Bill 199 moves to restrict the phone
number and address of judges and former judges from public disclosure.
It also protects the property and tax records so that people who are doing bad things that
may be upset with their decisions cannot find them as easily.
Any questions?
I'll yield to them now or yield the will.
Thank you, Ms. President, I yield the will.

Mr. President, the following message was received from the House and Mr. Riley.
The clerk thereof, Mr. President, the House is disagreed to the Senate's substance due
to the following bill of the House.
House Bill 68 will represent a burns of $1.59 and others.
It's billed to be titled next to make and provide appropriations for the state fiscal year.

for the operation of State Governance Departments and for other purposes, Mr. President, that completes
the order.
Senator from the 19th.
Mr. President, I move the Senate insists on its substitute to House Bill 68.
The Senator has moved that the Senate insists is the objection to the appropriations chair

Okay, so at this moment, we're going to break for lunch.
Another protein has lunch set up in the annual room here.
We're going to break for lunch and we'll reconvene probably about 1.15.
So Senate will standard E so about 115.
