Well good morning.
Here Burns and some of our members, including Chairman Petrie and Vice Chair Houston Gaines,
those who were and others who were instrumental in the passage of House Bill 1105 last year,
were invited to join President Trump today as he signs the Lake and Riley Act into law.
It will be the first bill President Trump signs during his second term and we're honored
to have Speaker Burns and other representatives from our state join him for this important
moment for Georgia and our nation.
Our chaplain this morning will be Pastor Julian Pace and Chairman Hitchens will introduce
our pastor.
Thank you very much, Madam Speaker.
I've been up here a lot of times to introduce preachers before in my career here, but this
is the first time I've ever done it to somebody I really didn't know.
This was Speaker Jones, Speaker Burns pastor of the day, and he called me this morning and
said, I'm going to Washington, you going to introduce my speaking name?
grew up in Effingham County and I immediately recognized his mother when I saw her because
her offices didn't rink in but I really didn't know him and now he's the faster central
alliance church into coalfalls with really amount of area address but he's well known
across the state he's done a lot of things he he previously served churches and rinking
and blooming down he loves to read theology books play guitar singing and walk out doors
Hill's a bachelor's degree in music for arms
from the Atlanta State University,
which is now part of Dordes Southern.
The Old's a master's degree in physical studies
from Carolina University.
He's currently pursuing a doctorate in theology
from Evangelical Theology Seminary
and Myers-Town, Pennsylvania.
His wife is Allison, and they have two children,
Gabriel and Joshua, if you stand up, please.
And his mother is also with us here today, Tracy Pace, and something of interest is both
his wife and his mother are licensed professional counselors.
And his mother, Tracy, is the incoming president of the Georgia Licensed Professional Counselors
Association.
And something I know about him that he didn't know that I know is he went to
he went to elementary school at Springfield Elementary School and the assistant
principal at that time was Dale Burns and I think he came in to preach
and naturally because Dale told me that he was sent to the office at least on
one occasion for talking too much and he said he said that gift all
He's much like Al Wim.
He said that gift most of his life.
But I asked her if she paddled him.
And she said, no, she may have a few years earlier.
But that had been outlawed by then.
So it gives me great pleasure to do this bastard Julian
pace.
Good morning legislators, as well as everyone else gathered
here today. Let me begin by saying that I feel truly honored and privileged to speak in
minister to you this morning in this truly hallowed place. Furthermore, thank you Speaker
Burns for the invitation to minister here today. Again, I am truly honored. According
to the prominent American philosopher and futurist Buckminster Fuller, humanity's knowledge doubled
roughly every century prior to the year 1900. By the conclusion of World War II, humanity's
knowledge was doubling approximately every 25 years. By the early 1980s, Fuller estimated
that humanity's knowledge was doubling roughly every 12 to 13 months. Remarkably by 2020,
Some futurists were already speculating that humanity's knowledge would soon double
every single day.
It is no wonder that our era is routinely referred to as the information age.
But perhaps our era should also be referred to as the age of irony.
For although we live in an era that is soaked with information and knowledge, we oftentimes
find ourselves thirsty for wisdom.
If wisdom is defined as knowledge skillfully applied, then the circumstances of our present
age strongly suggest that it has become more difficult than ever to skillfully apply
the knowledge that we possess.
The sheer vastness of humanity's knowledge is quite capable of intimidating and overwhelming
us.
Conversely, humanity's vast knowledge can also fill us with a spirit of unbridled hubris.
After more as humanity's knowledge base grows, so does our ability to craft powerful
new technologies, some of which threaten to warp our perspective on reality.
How do we effectively respond to these challenges?
Well perhaps we should look to the ancients for help, as many of them thought deeply about
the nature of wisdom and how to acquire it.
King Solomon, reputed by some to be the wisest person to ever live, wrote under divine
inspiration and now bequeathed to us the Book of Proverbs.
In Proverbs 9, wisdom is vividly personified as a noble woman who is right in the middle
of preparing a great banquet that all the peoples of the earth are invited to.
But here at this banquet, it is not literal food and drink that is on the offer.
Instead, Wisdom offers to all of her guests wise counsel and insight that is far superior
to any worldly pleasure.
Thus, King Solomon bequeaths to us the hopeful message that wisdom is available to all of
us, regardless of who we are.
But how might we take Wisdom up on her offer?
How do we even begin to acquire the wisdom we so desperately need to live and lead effectively
in our increasingly complex world. Fortunately, Proverbs chapter 9 gives us a clear answer.
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Thus, it is through humility. The clear recognition
of our limited knowledge and our shortcomings that we begin to acquire wisdom.
Furthermore, another portion of Scripture promises that, if we lack wisdom,
wisdom. God will give us all the wisdom we need, and then some, if we will but ask with
a humble heart, truly wisdom can be ours if we will but earnestly and humbly pursue
it. The historical record also gives us several examples of how humility leads to wisdom
and in turn true greatness. Several historians have noted that when George Washington was
still a young and inexperienced soldier, he could oftentimes be intemperant and arrogant.
It was said that he knew a little too well just how good he looked in uniform.
Such a disposition sometimes got him into trouble on the battlefield,
but fortunately for us all, Washington eventually learned his lesson and embraced the way of humility
over the way of hubris. When he could have been king of the United States, he
chose the limited powers of the presidency for a limited time, ultimately
distinguishing himself in that role. But no historical figure has better modeled
humility and a life wisely lived than Jesus of Nazareth, who though enduring the
humiliation of the cross also experienced the glories of resurrection. To all
those listening today, I implore you to embrace humility which leads to wisdom
and ultimately authentic greatness. And now let us set aside the next few moments
for a time of prayer. Please stand and join me for prayer and the recitation of
pledge of allegiance. Holy Triune God, empower us all to live humbly and wisely so that we may
honor you and bless our neighbors. Give us the wisdom we so desperately need to live and lead well
in the complex world in which we live. In Christ's name I pray, amen. Let us say the pledge together.
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for
which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.
The doorkeepers will unlock the doors, members may meet the chaplain in the South
any room in just a moment.

than 20 years of their lives serving their community. First, we have Danny Un,
son of Mr. Jay Un, former president of the Korean American Association of Greater Atlanta.
Next, we have Kim Yee, the daughter-in-law of Dr. Sam Chung, former president of the Korean
American Scholarship Foundation. And last we have Jeffrey Kim, grandson of Dr.
Young Kun Kim, founding member of the Korean American Scholarship Fund. We also
have with us in the gallery a lot of special guests who are here with us. And
last but not least we have our special speaker, Missou Ann Hong, President and
CEO of the Center for Asian Pacific American Women to provide us some special
remarks. So please join me in welcoming our special guests here in the
people's house. Thank you, Madam Speaker. Please give your attention, please.
Thank you so much, Madam Speaker. First of all, it is such an honor to be with all
of you today, I want to thank, start by thanking Representative Park, Representative
Hong, Representative Long and Representative Ao on creating this Korean American Day
resolution for Georgia. It's really a special day for us to recognize the contributions
of our leaders and our community. I myself this year is my 50th anniversary being in the
the United States.
Thank you.
I flew to this country by myself at the age of eight and I was adopted by my aunt and she
knew that I would have a better life and the American dream in the United States.
And believe it or not, going from Seoul, Korea to Hurley, Wisconsin, which is the upper
peninsula of Michigan, I was a little shell shocked culturally when I came here.
But I met my aunt in Chicago and we flew together and that started a whole new life and a whole
new trajectory for this little girl from Korea.
Now one of the things that I was really impressed with these amazing sons and daughters and
grandchildren of the honorees. Let me share a little a few things about the contributions
and by the way Madam Speaker, your office was roaring with laughter and connection while
you're here. And we had a wonderful opportunity to learn more. Danny Un, the eldest of three
boys, he talked about how he learned discipline from his father, Mr. Jay Un, and the fact
that he really cared deeply about making sure that the Korean American community is uplifted
and making sure that we all prospered. Also, Kim Yee, we were talking and laughing about
the fact that Danny's principal was actually her mother. So we were making all kinds of
wonderful connections. Jeffrey's the grandson and he talked about how he loved making fire
in the woods with this grandfather, and the fact that these are people personalized and
they're very much wonderful human beings.
And Sun Kim of Mr. Na Sung Ho, every day, every week shared food with seniors who were
50 to 70 years old and created his own programs.
And after putting my mom in memory care this past weekend, this would have meant so much
for her as she keeps going back to her first language, which is Korean.
So with that, I want to honor and thank our leaders of our community, the fact that we
have all these unsung heroes who are making a difference, and I honor all of you today.
Thank you so much, Madam Speaker.
You
We have one last morning order that the group was not here and they have now arrived, Chair
recognizes Chairman Meeks for a last morning order.
Thank you, Madam Speaker, joined by Chairman Buddy Deloche here.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have great leaders from all around our state today.
We are pleased to have the 2025 class leadership wane with us.
If y'all will, please stand be recognized.
Thank y'all for spending the day here at the Capitol
and your great leadership back in Jespin Wayne County.
We're moving on to morning orders, or I'm sorry, afternoon orders.
The chair recognizes Chairman Dickie and Meeks for an afternoon order.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
I'd also like to thank the members of a great delegation if they would come up.
It's well. I wanted to do a little thing about a friend of mine, a friend of ours for agriculture who passed away last week.
Everyone would stand, please.
So, I stand the well this morning on the passing of Charles Hall of Lagrange.
Charles was a devoted husband, father grandfather, and a friend of agriculture who passed away last week.
He's a proud alumnus at UGA, a lifelong bulldog served on many committees there as President
of UGA, UGA, C-A-E, Alumni Association, Board of Directors.
Charles founded his company Association Services Group in 1995, which was recognized many
times as one of the fastest growing companies in Georgia.
to train recognized Charles as well.
The company has helped many small and large associations be very successful throughout
our state and thrive.
But Charles really had a heart and loved agriculture.
He was known all over the state and the southeast for bringing ag groups together.
And he was Charles's idea to bring a bunch of peach growers, blueberry growers, by day
you onion growers together on the one umbrella, the Southeast Fruit and Vestible Association,
the Georgia Fruit and Vestible Association to a large trade show every year in Savannah.
And Charles had that brainstorm for that, worked to put it together, planned it for so
many years.
And but Charles was such a leader for ag issues all over our state in Washington.
And you know, he's someone who was, they said at his funeral, he was, he worked seven days
a week, but he was always at his church in the grains, the first baptist on the square
at the grain, he was a deacon and a grater.
So if you'd pause just a moment to recognize the life and the accomplishments of Charles
Hall.
Thank you very much, ma'am.
Chair recognizes representative Al Williams
for an afternoon order.
I'm speaking on you.
Thank you Madam Speaker.
Members of the House,
last year when I stood to go with some matters
history and protocol. Several of you mentioned that when you were a freshman you
were never told and I've learned this that those that did not listen they won't
listen so it doesn't bother me at all but Jacob should not lose his reward if
Israel does not hear so we'll just tell it again when speaking from this
well. One must be invited to the well by the speaker and not enter the well until the
speaker gives permission. The lights are here for a reason. Green means let it run. Yellow
means start to coast. Red means goodbye. That's as simple as I can put it. When someone
is speaking from this well. It is never acceptable to walk in front of them. Never
acceptable. That is a courtesy of this house. Never. When you're invited and others
decide to accompany you, first you should be approved by the speaker to accompany
the person who can give the consent from their podium. Once here, no one should ever stand
in front of the speaker who is in the well, never beside only. If you're late, that means
you're in the back. It doesn't mean continue to move forward. To the sides and to the
prayer. It looks bad. There are 180 of us here and I understand some of us could care less
because all of us bring here egos. If you didn't have an ego, you wouldn't have run.
And sometimes these egos get in the way of the rules. One thing about rules and I is talking
the best of this morning, 55 miles per hour on some highways. If you ignore it so be it,
but don't fix the ticket after you get it, because you knew the rules. If you disagree
with the rules, this is a democracy, but you must observe the rules without rules chaos.
the rules of a reason, try later to change the rules. There is a procedure. And in the
minority, that means gain the majority and you'll make the rules. Keep that in mind,
Mr. Leader. But it is so important that we demonstrate to this state that because they
have sent us here to represent them. Let's represent them in an outstanding fashion. Lastly,
you've heard me for 10 years, more than 10 years, represented Kathy Ash, taught me how to
save the pledge properly. Properly, if you read the plans of allegiance, the karma comes
After God, not after nation, it's one nation under God, then you pause.
Hey, don't worry about it. They do it wrong at the Super Bowl, but at least let's do it right
in the Georgia House. Let's set an example. Let's say the pledge correctly. That's just like
making sure the American flag is to the right of the speaker. Do it right. Now I'll be listening.
I know most of you could care less, but I will be listening.
Thank you Madam Speaker.
This is to be continued next year.
See you then.
Thank you.
The hard act to follow, the chair recognizes representative Tran for a morning or afternoon
order.
Thank you, Madam Speaker.
Not sure if I want to follow representative out volumes.
But happy new years, happy lunar new years, everyone.
Today, we will be celebrating lunar new year here
at the Capitol.
There'll be a lion dance at noon.
There'll be lunch in 514 COOB.
But it is the year of the snake.
And so with this year, the snake brings us vision.
So may our chambers see all the problems in Georgia
and use the intelligence of the snake
to find the solutions to those problems.
Madam Speaker, if you will indulge me
for just another minute, two years ago,
I came into this chamber and about 20,000 Ohio State fans
descended upon Atlanta,
and I didn't know what I was going to do
if Ohio State had won and beat UGA.
That didn't happen in UGA one,
But this past Monday, 20,000 Ohio State fans came once again
to feel the great Southern Hospitality of Georgia
and leave Mercedes-Benz Stadium
with a national championship.
So I'd like to extend our congratulations
to the Ohio State University,
but guys, the world's deadliest nut
and congratulate them on a national championship.
And I know my colleagues will say,
go dogs coming up in 2025,
But for today, I'm going to say go box.
Congratulations.
Oh, H.
