Good evening, sir. Sunday 9 pm scenario ... The smellsocket? All right, we're going to have the morning roll call. Wait a minute. Is the rules committee back in? Okay. All right, we're going to have the morning roll call. All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? The clerk will lock the machines. The clerk will please close the doors and keep them closed. Well, good morning. Happy Friday. Open up by adding a real early plans back home today. We'll have the devotion here in a minute, so I would continue to ask, is I have most days to remember the people of Ukraine who are still so bravely defending themselves against a cruel, cruel tyrant, and they need our prayers. We will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 72nd House District Representative Josh Bonner, Representative Bonner. Good morning, colleagues. It's my honor to introduce our chaplain of the day. The Reverend George Dillard. Reverend Dillard is no stranger to the Capitol. He is the senior pastor at Peachtree City Christian Church has been there since 1993. He is very involved in his community. He is a father grandfather. His wife Renee, they're both very active in our community back in Peachtree City. Reverend Dillard has spoken to this chamber a number of times, our friends over in the Senate, and has also presided over prayers in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. So it is my honor today to introduce our chaplain of the day, Reverend George Dillard. Good morning. I'm glad to be here. I know with this beautiful Georgia weather that you would rather be outside than sequestered in this room. And so I hope that the predictions of the time that you have to spend here today are grossly over-exaggerated. So speaking of weather, a few years ago, a number of years ago, I was taking a backpacking trip on the Appalachian Trail. I was in college and I know it is hard to imagine, but I was in good physical shape in those days. I played two sports in college. I played basketball and soccer and a number of my friends. So let's go back packing on the Appalachian Trail in February. And we went, spent a few days up there on the way out. There were seven of us and the group was made up of gentleman who were a little bit older than me, a couple of professors and some guys who graduated before me and they were not moving as quickly as I wanted to move. And so a friend of mine, my roommate actually and I took off without him. We crossed over the ridge of the mountain, started down the trail, the descent, on the shadowy side of the mountain. I don't know if that means anything to you, but what it does mean is that there was ice on the trail and I came to a patch of ice. It was about 20 feet long and about three feet wide and there was a wall straight up and a wall straight down. And I did not have the equipment. I was not prepared for that. I was not a seasoned hiker, but I was confident. I was physically fit. I felt like I was fairly intelligent, but that would soon be proved to be wrong. And I started going across the ice very slowly, very deliberately, with purpose. And about halfway across one foot slipped, then the other foot slipped. And I did this silly little dance for a few seconds until I landed on my bottom, rolled over on my stomach and slid off of the side of the trail and grabbed a rock that was hanging out, dangling 150 feet above the canyon floor. And my roommate was laughing. He thought that was funny. I almost died. You say, well, what does that have to do with anything? Well, I think sometimes when we tackle things, we are confident. We are sure of ourselves. We are really, really prepared, we think. But sometimes we just need to slow down, consider deeper wisdom, deeper truth. You know, in Joshua 1, it says, have I not commanded you be strong and courageous, do not be afraid, do not be discouraged for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go. I tell people, sometimes it's just as important what the Scripture doesn't say, as what it does say, say it doesn't say be stupid, be reckless, be unprepared, or be self-centered, which I was all of those things. And it almost cost me my life. The people of the state of Georgia depend on you greatly, to be strong, to be courageous, to be unafraid, and to not be discouraged. But at the same time, I would encourage you, do not be reckless, do not be unprepared, and do not be self-centered. Philippians 2 says, be like-minded, having the same love, being in one spirit, one mind, and do nothing out of selfish ambition, or vain conceit. Rather, in humility, value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests, but each of you to the interest of others. And I want to encourage you, we very much value your service. We appreciate your dedication. But I want to encourage you to remember that every one of us works for all of the citizens of Georgia, and that we should look at what is good and what is right. We need to take our time. We need to be deliberate. We need to be united. I just want to close with reminding you that of all the things that Jesus prayed about on the last night before he went to the cross, he prayed for unity. Father, make them one as you and I are one. If it's that important to Jesus, then I think it ought to be important to this body, to the people of this state, and to the people of this nation. I commend you for your service. I encourage you to be strong, be courageous, be unafraid, be wise, be deliberate, and be united. Would you stand and pray with me? Father, your word tells us that you are our help and ages past and our hope and days to come. And so, Father, we come to you today looking for our help and our hope. Father, the blessed body with wisdom, with courage, with strength, with deliberation, but above all unity. So that the service that they provide, that they render, that they give will be beneficial to this state and to all who it affects. We give thanks for this day, for this is the day that you have made and we rejoice and are glad in it. In Jesus name, amen. Our pledge allegiance to the flying of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Doorkeepers will unlock the doors. Members may greet the chaplain in the south any room. Chair recognizes Chairman Hogan, the chair of the Committee on Information and Audits. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

You did not help the people of Georgia in the toughest time of their life. This is my life. The editorial lies. Okay. This is my apology. Is it not true, sir, that I regret that vote? If the gentleman so states, I think he's sincere in making that statement. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the lady's motion. The eyes are 147. The knees are nine. This motion carries and the House is reconsidered its action and the resolution will go back on the general calendar. We're going on now to morning orders. Morning orders. Let's limit morning orders to two minutes each today. That limit will be strictly enforced. Chair recognizes the chairman of the House Ethics Committee, Chairman Nix, for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, I would like to bring your attention to an article that I had put on your desk this morning. The ugly truth behind those fun gambling ads, and it further states that we're looking at a national crisis of gambling addiction. Now, we're approaching crossover day, and you can bet that that old gambling monster is going to rise up out of the dark and going to come strolling in here pretty soon. Before you commit, I would like for you to read this because you're going to be told that if you pass gambling laws, all of our problems will go away in this state. That everything will be, will be, have so much money we can adopt Alabama. That wouldn't take much, you know. But seriously, please, please read this article. This talks about the devastation that gambling has on individuals, on families, and on communities. It's written by somebody who was an executive in the gambling business, and he talks about the fact that they prey on the addictive factor of gambling. At the bottom of the second page, it talks about brain chemistry, said the neuroscience of gambling is exactly the same as other addictive behaviors such as drugs, alcohol, sex, and eating. So we're talking about mental health and how important it is. Let's don't try to fix it in one area, and then cause all kinds of problems in the other area. Thank you, Ms. Speaker, I'll yield the will. Chair recognizes representative Rick Williams for a morning order. Thank you, Ms. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, to come to you this morning about trains. If we could talk about trains for just a moment, I know probably a lot of you are like me. We got them as gifts when we were small. Some of us, some of you got electric trains. I just got a regular train. We lived so far in the country, we didn't have electricity. So, you know, trains have been good, and we all need them, and they move freight, but we don't need them three miles long. I have a resolution urging the federal railroad administration to follow through with their recommendation that trains not exceed 8,500 feet long. Now, it's a public safety issue in a lot of small towns. All you have is three or four train crossings, and there's three mile long train shuts down the whole town. So I'll have this resolution at my desk. If any of you would like to stop by and sign it, it's just urging the federal railroad administration to follow through with this effort to regulate train length. Thank you very much, Miss Speaker. Chair, recognize this representative Kent Trail from morning order. Thank you, Miss Speaker, colleagues. I rise this morning to say words that I never dreamed whatever come out of my mouth. I agree with Speaker Nancy Pelosi. I agree with Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the first time, and I join my voice with hers in urging President Biden to suspend all imports of Russian oil while during this invasion of our friends in Ukraine. I think we can find something we all agree with. Every dollar we spend on Russian oil is a dollar spent supporting their efforts against Ukraine. So I want to encourage all of us to contact our congressmen and our senators and urge them all together, let's join together in suspending all imports of oil from Russia. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Okay, we're now going on to the rules calendar. Going on to the rules calendar. Parker read the caption to House Bill 1183. House Bill 1183 by Representative Gunner of the 8th and others to be entitled back to amend the Chapter 6 and Title 17. The official go to Georgia, and tentative relating to bond and recognuses, so is to provide for an increase in the time allotted to try a criminal case in judicial emergencies. This bill ever referred to the Committee on Judiciary and Non-Civil. That committee recommends a dispelled do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Gunner to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, 1183 is Judicial Council Bill to clean up some language in an act that was passed back in 2018. There was a couple of scriveners, errors in it that made it very confusing about the return of a bond when a fugitive isn't returned back to the court. As the timeline, it gives the Bosman more time to bring the fugitive back to the court. It gives them incentive because they get an increase in return of the portion of the bond that they put up. And I'll answer any questions if you have any on the bill, but basically it's just a clean up bill of that language. You have, will you do have a question? Do you hear to you? I'll you you'll chair recognizes representative cannon to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Do you yield? I you do you consider this bill to be criminal justice reform? In a certain manner, yes. You have no further questions. I yield well and ask for your favorable consideration. Thank you. Gentlemen, as you did the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? No. The clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 1183. The eyes are 157. The nays are zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Off the supplemental rules calendar, the chair will have the clerk read the caption to Senate Bill 472. Senate Bill 472 by Senator Kennedy E8 to be talon act to amend Article 1 of Chapter 2 and Title 46 to be officially billed to George Antega relating to the organization and members of the Public Service Commission, so it's to change the description of the election districts for members of the Public Service Commission. Chair recognizes Chairman Rich to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House. I am so happy to rise today to present to you Senate Bill 472 because I believe that this may be my last legislative action as arising from my chairing the legislative and congressional reapportionment committee this last year. We are at the end of our time frame as we all know qualifying begins on Monday. Senate Bill 472 is legislation that redraws the lines for all five of our Public Service Commission districts. These maps were drawn by our joint office of reapportionment and were approved by all five of the Public Service Commissioners. These maps, these lines readjust the population for these residency districts. These are different. These are statewide elections and we are redrawing residency districts. They create the pools from which Public Service Commissioners may run for office for statewide election. These maps provide for a population deviation of plus or minus 1% the maps were necessary of course because of the population changes and shifts over the last 10 years. And with that I will yield for a couple of questions in case we need any clarification. Do you have a question? I do. Chair recognizes representative Stacy Evans to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the lady yield? I do. You mentioned that these new districts will go into effect so that the voters can vote for PSC members on a statewide basis. That is correct. We yield for one further question. Yes. Isn't it true that right now there is litigation pending that the way that we do these PSC elections by statewide vote should be overturned as unconstitutional and violation of several different rules in it. And we very well may soon be voting for by district and we would be stuck with these districts for that as well. Is that true? No, it is not entirely true. It is absolutely true that plaintiffs have alleged that the way that we elect our public service commissioners should is incorrect and unconstitutional. But I do not believe that will be overturned. These public service commissioners have always been elected statewide. We yield for one further. One more. Recognizing that we don't agree on how this litigation is going to turn out. Yes. If it is overturned, this is the map that will be used for the new district votes for PSC. Yes. Yes. This is the map that is being passed along with all other maps for redistricting because we have to operate and run elections this year. And yes, that is correct. Do you yield for any further questions? Mr. Speaker, I will yield the well. I believe that there are others who wish to speak to this and that some of the issues may be clarified through further testimony. Ladies yielded the well. We do have other members who wish to be heard. Chair recognizes representative Hugley to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I rise to talk today about the Georgia Public Service Commission. The Public Service Commission is one of several boards and commissions required by our state constitution. It regulates public utilities such as gas and electricity making it one of the most important governmental bodies for pocketbook issues affecting everyday Georgians. Article 4 Section 1 paragraph 1 of the Georgia Constitution provides that the commission self consists of five members elected by the people to stagger six-year terms. But it gives us the general assembly, the duty of providing for the time and manner of electing commission members. We have the constitutional power and the duty to say whether elections for public service commission will be held in May, November or some other time. We have the power to require partisan elections or non-partisan elections. And we have the power to require that elections be held by districts or that they be held statewide. Currently, the general assembly has chosen to provide by statute that all five commissioners are to be elected statewide in partisan elections and that they must live in one of the five residency districts in order to qualify for the ballot. The most residency districts are what SB 472 draws. But I want to give you a little history today because it wasn't always this way. The Public Service Commission dates back to 1879 when the general assembly created a railroad commission for the purpose of regulating railroad passenger and freight rates and services. And I'm inconsistent of three members appointed by the governor. In 1906, the general assembly provided that members of the railroad commission would be elected statewide rather than appointed by the governor. In 1907, we expanded the commission from three to five members. In 1922, we changed the name of the railroad commission to the Public Service Commission to reflect and increasingly variety of services and utilities included under the commission's jurisdiction. In 1943, we gave the commission constitutional status, which insulated the commission somewhat from politics. But still, we provided by statute that the commissioners would be elected statewide. In 1998, we created residential districts for members of the Public Service Commission. Under that statute, the state was divided into five districts and each member of the Public Service Commission was required to live in one of those five districts in order to run. I was in the general assembly at the time as were a few of my colleagues that are still here. I remember that the purpose of Institute and Residency District was to ensure that commission members would come from more than just a concentrated metro Atlanta area that they could come from all areas of the state because this commission regulates industry that affects the state. But still, it was provided by statute that the commissioners would be elected statewide. We re-redued the residency districts in 2002 and in 2012. But still, we provided by statute that commissioners would be elected statewide. In the 1943 history of the Public Service Commission, only one African American has ever been elected statewide. That was David Burgess, who was appointed by Governor Barnes to feel a vacancy in 1998 and was elected in 2000. He was defeated in his bid for re-election in 2006 and every other commissioner to the commission over the years has been white. As some of you know, there is an ongoing lawsuit challenging the statewide method of elected members of the Public Service Commission. That case is called Rolls-Versus Rathansberger. The plaintiffs are four African American voters and they claim that statewide elections dilute minority voting strength in our state, where minority voters make up more than 40% of the state's population but have zero representation on the Public Service Commission. I am opposing SB 472, my dear colleagues, and I urge you to do the same because it does not reflect the diversity of our great state. There's an old saying, when you know better, you need to do better. And I think it's time for us to do better. I think it's time for us to give minority voters an opportunity to elect candidates of their choice to the commission. Rather than perpetuating 143 years of exclusion and unfairness, we have the power to provide for fair elections and we should use it. SB 472 is unfair to the people of Georgia and I urge that you vote no. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and my colleagues, I yield the wealth. Chair recognizes representative Park to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today in opposition to Senate Bill 472 because it violates the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibits all forms of racial discrimination and voting. As representative Hugh Glee mentioned, as representative Stacey Evans noted, as some of y'all may know, which bears repeating, there is an ongoing federal lawsuit challenging the statewide method of electing members of the Public Service Commission. That case is called Rose V. Rathensberger, the plaintiffs are for African-American voters and they claim that statewide elections for the Public Service Commission dilute minority voting strength in our state. Only one person of color has ever been elected to the commission and its 143 year history and that was more than 20 years ago. In late January, the court in that case issued a ruling indicating that the at-large method of electing members of the Public Service Commission likely violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. A trial is set for June and the court is likely to rule before our November elections. Given the court's ruling, it makes no sense for us to adopt SB 472, which perpetuates statewide elections for members of the PSC. We would be adopting a statute that is likely unlawful and discriminatory and it could be seen as thumbing our nose at the court. We should instead heed the court's warning and switch to elections by district. My colleagues in the redistricting committee offered an amendment to do just that. I also believe that the residency districts created by SB 472 are discriminatory. Under the current map, there are two majority minority districts, districts 2 and 3. District 3 is anchored by the city of Atlanta and District 2 is anchored by Gwinnett County. When we drew the residence requirements in 2012, neither of these districts were majority minority, but Georgia's minority population exploded over the last decade and we now have two majority minority districts. Senate Bill 472 would dismantle one of those districts, District 2, the Gwinnett district. To the majority party, please stop messing with Gwinnett County. Stop undermining the will of Gwinnett voters. Y'all do know that approximately one in ten Georgians live in Gwinnett County because we are a great place to live, work and play. As a voters of Gwinnett County were instrumental in electing President Biden along with United States Senators John Assoff and Reverend Warnoch, Gwinnett voters will be instrumental in determining who will serve in all of our statewide constitutional offices. So I would assert that it may be in the best interest of the majority party to vote no to SB 472. SB 472 moves Gwinnett from District 2 to District 4, which is dominated by mostly white areas and no-

for East Georgia. District 2, meanwhile, takes in mostly white areas in rural South Georgia and flips from majority to minority to majority white. Let's be clear, this is no accident. SB 472 wasn't even introduced as a bill until after the federal court ruled in January that the residency districts probably violate section 2. Whoever drew these new districts saw the writing on the wall. They realized that the residency districts could soon become election districts and they drafted SB 472 to take away minority electoral opportunity just as they were about to win it in court. Are we disricting guidelines require all plans to comply with section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965? This one does not and we haven't even heard an argument that it does. I'm going to vote no on this discriminatory bill and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. We have a minority report by rule 20 minutes for the minority report and to give it, chair recognizes the leader of the minority caucus leader Beverly. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise in opposition to Senate Bill 472. The Senate Republicans met for redrawing the residency districts used by members of the Georgia's Public Service Commission because this bill has been advanced under false pretenses. Our colleagues in the Senate justified Senate Bill 472 as a necessary as the 2020 census to bring those residency districts into compliance with the one person, one vote principal of the Constitution that we've all heard so much about during the redistricting process. But the one person, one vote principal does not apply to residency districts. The Supreme Court decided that 1975, a case called Dallas versus Reese, one person, one vote is thus not a reason, not a reason to redraw the PSE residency districts. Even if the one person, one vote, did apply, there would be no reason to redraw the PSE's residency districts because the population deviation, which by colleague spoke of, remained still to this day, remain within constitutional limits after the 2020 census. Now, our colleagues in the Senate, the Senate, never gave us the population of those existing districts under the 2020 census. But we asked, we asked the LCRO to provide those numbers, legislative congressional reapportionment office, LC, to provide those numbers. And we discovered that the overall deviation existing, and the existing map is below the 10% threshold that is presumptively constitutional. So even if the one person, one vote principal did apply, it wouldn't justify SB 472. Our Senate colleagues also told us that the population shifts and Georgia required that they radically reconfigure the existing districts. Their map actually shifts 44 counties, more than a quarter of the states 159 counties into new districts, 44 counties. But that justification just doesn't add up. We drew the Georgia House Democratic Caucus drew a plan that shifts only 13 counties. Has lower population deviation, splits fewer cities, protects all incumbents, and maintains the core of the existing districts must better than their plan does. And we offer this alternative map that better meets the needs of their stated goals and justification for SB 472. But they did not adopt it. No, answer was no. Why not? Because the justification given to us and to the people of Georgia by our state, Senate colleagues was merely a pretext for their real motive, a subterfuge. Let me tell you what's really going on here. And late January, a federal court issued a ruling indicating that the at large method of electing members of the Public Service Commission likely violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. This means that the PSE residency districts could soon become election districts. SB 472 was introduced only after the federal court made that clear. Why? Because low and behold, population shifts over the last decade in Georgia have turned two districts that were majority white in 2012 into majority minority districts by 2020. One anchored in Atlanta, the other anchored in Gwyneth County. As my colleague Brett Park said, leave Gwyneth alone. SB 472 dismantles the Gwyneth district, restoring it to majority white status and eliminating the minority voters' electoral opportunity just as they were about to win an in court that didn't just happen by accident. McNomastake SB 472 is an apparent response to the federal court's ruling. It is intended to prevent minority voters in Georgia from having an opportunity to elect members of the Public Service Commission. It is an intentional effort to dilute minority voting strength. In the violates the Federal Voting Rights Act in the United States Constitution, the fellow members of the House, my fellow Georgians, we should not. We must not have any part of that. Intentional racial discrimination is wrong no matter what party affiliation you happen to be in. You know that? Now appeal to your conscience and to your vote or urge you or urge you to vote no. Well SB 472 thank you Mr. Speaker, yield a well. Gentlemen as yielded the well we have the chairman's time now also set by rule of 20 minutes chair recognizes chairman gains for the chairman's time. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I want to point out several things that have been brought up by the minority party and and and clarify some information that I think has been inaccurate. First off no member of this body is introduced legislation to elect the PSC by district that I'm aware of and to try to make this change at the 11th hour before qualifying begins on Monday is not a good decision. Again there is pending litigation and that will move through the courts but to try to do this at the 11th hour when qualifying starts on Monday to move it by district is not wise. Additionally it would take a constitutional amendment to change it. The courts have interpreted since the beginning that the where it says elected by the people that is statewide. So it would take a constitutional amendment something again no member of this bodies introduced and to try to put an amendment on this bill and committee which failed or to try to change it at this point does not make sense. There was also the the point brought up by the minority party that there's only been one African American to ever serve on the public service commission. Brian Kemp just appointed Fitz Johnson and he's up this year and so there there was a point saying there's zero African American representation and that is not true. Again Fitz Johnson's on the public service commission today and is up for reelection this year. Additionally the minority leader brought up that currently we have 10% deviation he suggested that's within the constitutional limits. The courts have said that we must get as close as practical and the temper the courts have ruled that 10% is not good enough. By keeping the maps as they are currently today for example district one would have 133,000 less people which these are residency districts that means that 130,000 133,000 less people would have the opportunity to run for public service commission from that district. By keeping the maps as they are today we would not we would not be allowing candidates and in these districts to run and to serve statewide. So I think it's important that we pass Senate Bill 472 here today and send this on to the governor's desk. Mr. Speaker I'll yield the well and ask the body's favorable consideration. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill. The chair here's none the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of Senate Bill 472 will vote aye those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does representative Mary Frances Williams rise parliamentary question. Thank you. I'm sorry. Mr. Speaker and colleagues isn't it true that it's never too late to do the right thing. What purpose does representative de Lought rise parliamentary and thank you. Mr. Speaker isn't it true that when the current law that created residency districts was passed Tom Murphy was speaker of this house and Roy Barnes was the governor of this state and the fact is had they voted by districts they feared that a republican might be elected. There was a lot of that going around back then. What purpose does representative McLeod rise. Parliamentary inquiry. Is it true that my colleagues have used the same method to draw this map as they did in Gwyneth. I assume that was I wasn't there when either of them were drawn I can't answer that question. What purpose does chairman sets were rise parliamentary inquiry. No. Isn't it true that procedurally we never would mention names in this body but if we took the vote count and took the names of folks that voted that on that bill that representative de Lought alluded to there'd be members in this body who may be contemplating a red vote who actually voted green when this was put in place in that tree. Mr. Speaker. If the gentleman's so states I'm sure he believes it to be true. Final parliamentary inquiry. What purpose does representative Paris rise. Parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Speaker is not true that two wrongs don't make a right and can we please start living in the present and stop referring to future past mistakes of past legislatures. Well if I think if everyone agreed to do that it would be good. That would require both sides doing it. Have all members voted have all members voted. If so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of Senate Bill 472. The eyes are 97. The names are 68. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. What purpose does chairman gains rise to make a motion. State your motion. Mr. Speaker I move that we immediately transmit Senate Bill 472 to the Senate. Chairman gains has moved that the Senate Bill 472 be immediately transmitted to the Senate. Is there there is objection to the gentleman move. Gentlemen moves. All those in favor of the media transmittal will vote aye those opposed to immediate transmittal will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Well purpose does the minority caucus whip rise. Is it not true I was immediately pressed my button to ask for the intent to serve notice for reconsideration for this bill. It is true that the first person that came on the board here was chairman gains in you were second. Thank you Mr. Speaker. What purpose is representative cannon rise. Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Is it not true that there is a rush measure happening from the Republican side right now that has to do with Sunday's deadline and that has not been spoken to on this floor. I'm not sure I understand your deadline earlier question you might want to talk to chairman gains about that. Well purpose is representative Wilkerson rise. I would like to ask from a ruling from the chair if every bill should be able to be reconsidered prior to being transmitted out of this chamber. The rules of the house provide that that has to be taken up immediately and it was taken up in a timely manner. That's the ruling of the chair. Have all members voted on the motion. If so the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of or on the motion for immediate transmittal the eyes are 96 the nasors 68 and Senate bill 472 is on its way to the Georgia state Senate. Clerk will read the caption to House bill 1178. House bill 1178 will represent the bottom of the 72nd and others will be titled an act to a men part five art 16 of chapter two title 20 the fish go to Georgia annotated relay in a review of removal of students and elementary and secondary education. So just to provide for the protection of the fundamental rights of parents directly upbringing and education of the minor children. This bill I've referred to the committee on education that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes the governor's four liter representative bonner to present the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker. This morning I rise to present House bill 1178 the parents bill of rights. This is a key priority in governor Kimps education agenda. Colleagues my wife and I have been married almost 24 years. In fact our 24th wedding anniversary is April 4th. Sani Dye and I can't tell you how much I look forward to spending that anniversary with each and every one of you. Now one of the many lessons I've learned over those years of our marriage is that it worked best when there was open communication and transparency. As our children came along we learned that our family worked best when we were all working together to move in the same direction instead of working against each other. I believe that public education works best when we apply those same principles of open communication and transparency. House bill 1178 does just that. First this bill places into black letter law the rights of parents we all know to be true. It codifies parents rights and the responsibility of the local school system in one place. Currently most are addressed through board rule which is easily undone but law is not. This will make it easier for districts and parents to understand their roles. Second it centralizes and streamlines the process for parents to obtain information regarding their child and provides a framework for schools to provide that information. This bill is not meant to be punitive in any way. It does not sing aloud an individual teacher, school or school board. It was drafted in conjunction with educators and parents from a cross section of our state. I believe this bill will encourage a greater partnership between parents and teachers. And I think that we can all agree that education works best in a community where parents play an active role alongside our teachers in preparing our children for success. And Mr. Speaker with that I'll be happy to answer any questions. Do you yield for questions? I do. Chair recognizes representative Canon, do you're left for a question? Thank you Mr. Speaker. Do you yield? I do. How does this bill impact the special rights that those who are in special ed have right now? You know the parents rights of special education? It does not impact those rights to my knowledge. Do you yield again to clarify the question? Sure. So how does this line up beside those? Is this give more rights to parents of students who are not a part of the special ed program than those who are in the special ed program? It does not give anyone any more or less rights that are in place right now. Thank you for the question. You further yield? I do. Chair recognizes chairman Carson, do you're left for a question? Is it gentleman you? I do. Thank you for bringing this bill. Isn't it true? The not only is the intent but also what is achieved in this bill is greater transparency for Georgia's parents? Absolutely. Thank you for the question. You're exactly right. Thank you very much. I'll yield for one more Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes chairman Martin, do you arrive for a question? The floor of your yield? I do. To follow up on the ladies question earlier, I believe the what she might have been referring to is there are special rights, is it not true given if your child is in a special education or special needs program and has a special plan that exists today in current law? Isn't that true? Correct. Like an idea. And if you isn't true that that would be a subset of all the students in our population. Correct. And your bill today is for the entire population. So isn't it true that this bill takes nothing away from those subset of students and their parents' rights but in fact gives them additional rights as regular students in the school system that all other students and parents would have. That's correct. So this addresses the superset of all of the students in the school and does not negatively impact the rights that adhere today to those students in special education and their parents' rights. That's correct. Thank you for the question. I just wanted to I thought that's what the you and I had spoken with for thank you for the thank you. With that Mr. Speaker, I will yield the well and ask for your favorable consideration. Gentlemen, is yielded the well? We have other members who wish to be heard on the bill. I would ask members to bear in mind that the rules committee has voted to limit debate to a total of one hour on each of these measures on the calendar today. That time will be allocated equally between each side. A total of 30 minutes for those in opposition to be allocated between themselves as H.C. Fiat. Chair recognizes representative Stacey Evans to speak to the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I rise in opposition to House Bill 1178. As a parent, I have a fourth grader and I have a, I don't even know what we call it, two-year-old pre-school. And I think the parent teacher relationship is extremely important and I think that we are really putting it at risk even further than it already is with this bill. Tensions are high already. That relationship, that antagonistic relationship that was, has been developing between teachers and parents. It's been going on for a while. I know every time we have a parent teacher conference for our daughter, we don't have them for our son yet, two-year-old pre-school doesn't have parent teacher conferences. But we always are very upfront. We say, we are on your side. We don't want to, we don't want you to tell us what you think we want to hear. We want to hear the good, the bad, the ugly. And I have felt compelled to say that every year that she's been in school, which has been at least five in K through 12. And I say that because there has been this distrust, the parents side with the kids and not trusting the teachers, and this only makes that worse. And that's my overarching concern about this piece of legislation. But I have a couple of specifics that I also want to talk about. Number one, being under this bill, we are going to allow parents to decide that their minor children, which is defined as individuals under the age of 18, we are going to allow the parents to opt those children out of sex education. First of all, we don't define sex education, which is a problem. But number two, the age of consent to sex in this state is 16. So 16 year olds, 17 year olds, legally can decide whether to have sex or not. But their parents get to decide whether they should have sex education. That is really bad policy. I love my daughter and I think we have a great relationship and I hope that she will always be willing to come and talk to me about sex and I hope my son does too. But they might not. And everybody in here knows that there are children that either don't have the kind of relationship with their parents where they can go and talk to them about these things or they just don't want to. I would like to think that if we are under state policy, you're going to say that 16 and 17 year olds can make their own decisions about having sex, that we would let them sit in a classroom and have some sex education. That just makes logical sense to me. My other specific concern about this bill is that we're going to have teachers now basically subject to open records requests. I think anybody in this room that's ever dealt with those knows that we have this three day rule where you got to let people know what's available and no one likes it. No one likes dealing with it. It's hard. Now we're going to put that burden on teachers. If a parent comes up and asks for these materials, you got three days, three business days to get it out. I know we have this 30 day period where you can say, well, we got some things but they're not ready. But all this does is set up a fight and logistical nightmares for our teachers to deal with. These requests for information and then someone saying, oh, you didn't give me everything. I know there's got to be more talk about yesterday in this chamber, I think everyone was clapping for kill all the lawyers. This is going to keep the lawyers pretty busy trying to figure out what what wasn't wasn't produced. And the last specific thing I want to touch on is we say that at any time, parents should be able to review instructional material. We're making this in code. And I don't have a problem with that. And I don't think most teachers would have a problem providing information. But instructional material is broad. It's defined in 20-2-1010 and 20-2-1017. It includes digital images, articles, music videos. So what happens when a teacher tries to share current events in a video in an article or pull up a website? And then that's gone. We're going to set up litigation because they didn't provide every little piece of instructional information to the parents. Those are the things I worry about. And I would urge you to vote no. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Chair recognizes Representative Allen to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today not in opposition to parents. In parents' rights, but to oppose an election year, ploy designed to win cheap political points and fuel campaign millers. I rise in support of educators who we place such a high value on in this state. And over the past two years, we have called them essential workers because we have seen them step up and step in when called. We should be supporting the partnership between parents and educators, not undermining the public trust in educators and public education. One constituent summed it up best when he emailed me and said this and it's a quote, this is the worst education legislation I've ever seen. This is a solution in search of a problem adding layers of bureaucracy and codifies many things parents can already do and most schools are generally helpful with, talk through, reach common understanding in an cooperative manner. End quote. Now it was even said in rules this morning. I wrote this down that, you know, the two things we want to know is why is this bill needed and how does it solve a problem? This legislation does neither. As these attacks on teachers and principals have moved through the process, I have not heard one story from a parent needing to legislate the parent teacher relationship. So since I'm a parent of a public school child, let me tell you what I experience in the parent teacher relationship. It's collaborative. It's built on trust and it is between me, my wife, and the teacher. Such a personal relationship does not need to be codified. It needs to be individualized. Now right now in Georgia, we have two critical workforce crisis. We have educators and nurses and health care. As it relates to educators, what do you think this will do to recruitment when teachers and principals find out that they will be forced to drop everything they're doing and respond to an unlimited number of parent questions about the curriculum? Now most of this they already share freely, along with their other immeasurable workloads. And now in this legislation, if not, they can be brought in front of a board for some undescribed punishment. And secondly, it could have a chilling impact on the open flow of information and dialogue that parents already have with teachers. Teachers will be on edge not knowing what response to give or if the response will get them second guest or even terminate it. Now as a parent, I already have access to the curricula, the student attendance grades and even behavior. My teacher communicates with me frequently if not daily in a variety of ways and welcomes the parent involvement. You see good teaching involves assessment, planning and real-time modification based on the child and the environment. It is unreasonable to expect educators to provide details weeks in advance of what they're going to teach. So let me try to explain the burden on our teachers this way. This is the equivalency of asking you to post.

What you will be eating for breakfast lunch and dinner for the next nine weeks Be sure to list all the ingredients That you'll be using where you purchase them and any recipes including the author and the publisher of the cookbooks You list all the utensils and Appliance is used for preparing serving eating cleaning up and be sure to include your beverage choices and Table condiments and any guest chefs that may come in and cook oh and any restaurants and And furthermore Anyone you are feeding who disagrees with any of the meals you've prepared they must be given an alternative meal And you need to describe those meals too Do you still want to be a teacher in Georgia? We need Our teachers to feel supported and Not constantly undermind and under attack if there is an example of a problem Let's discuss it But playing politics with my daughter's education and the children of Georgia is not acceptable And I hope we vote down this measure and start finding real solutions to solve the real problems in our education system This is not it. Mr. Speaker I yield the well You Chair recognizes representative Roberts to speak to the bill Thank you, Mr. Speaker your colleagues For those of you in the chamber who are parents I bet you're like me You'll never forget The first time you laid eyes on your child When they laid my daughter in my arms for the first time there was this Overwhelming tsunami of just pure joy and love Only then to be met with equal parts of terror at the thought that not only do I have to keep this little creature alive till she's 18 But I also have to make sure that she's kind and responsible human being proud to say I think I've done a pretty good job as I'm about to send her off to college this fall And I can say without absolute certainty that there is no other role I play in life wife daughter friend attorney that informs me more than being a mother So I want to start here Where I think all the parents in this chamber can agree that we want what's best for our kids Unfortunately, this bill is not what's good for Georgia's children When I sat down to really dig into the bill just like any other bill I started with the why why do we need this bill? Because we have such limited time to do the people's business in this chamber Do I think we should strive to put forth bills that will do the most good for the most people? So I have to be honest I really couldn't find the why as it relates to how it benefits Georgia families The bill entitled the parental bill of rights doesn't really grant many rights that we don't inherently or in law already have Section one lays out I think 11 rights. I'm not going to go through them all But the right to direct the education and health care of my child the right to director up bringing in our moral training the right and Responsibility to a roller and public school or mover to a private school or home school the right to access and review all our school records The right to make health care decisions y'all we have all those rights. This is not doing anything new Then we move into section two where school administrators and teachers are given their marching orders to comply with this parental bill of rights We've heard proponents of this bill say that a lot of the procedures if not all of them are already in place But that this measure centralizes the information That may be true, but why we're here passing a bill. We agree that doesn't change much It certainly doesn't address real concerns Facing students or educators like the billion dollar school funding shortfall we racked up for a decade It doesn't fix our significant teacher shortage in this state, but rather exacerbates it Instead it seems to perpetuate a pattern that has been forming the session that a few loud voices get to control at the expense of the majority How are local maps are drawn and here what our children learn in school What this bill does do is put another administrative burden on teachers and another avenue to open them up to criticism I've had teachers tell me that through the ordeal of being sent back to the classroom with fewer protections against COVID They've been made to feel like glorified babysitters and that's nothing against our amazing childcare providers of our state, but our teachers Deserve better. They're tired and frustrated by a state government whose idea of backing them up is a Long overdue raise that amounts to little more than a cost of living adjustment which should be the floor They're overwhelmed and overburdened Now you may say this bill isn't for the teachers. It's about parents The alleged intent is to require a plan for parental participation I can't remember a single time in the history of my child's education That I didn't know how I could participate whether it was in the PTA Volunteering in the classroom or the library. I attended every parent school night every parent teacher conference I heard about what she was learning because I asked her about it every day after school I looked at her books. She brought home the websites all provide the curriculum online I saw this as my responsibility as a parent to take that initiative I've never felt like I couldn't contact her teachers or the principal if I had a concern But what I have never expected is that because I'm a Catholic I have the right to demand my religion Be taught at the exclusion of others or even taught about I never expected that I could demand my child to forego immunizations That have been required for decades for the benefit of public health In a recent AJC guest column by a 15-year teacher from Milton High School Who is one teacher of the year twice she sounds the alarm about how the teaching profession is in crisis and our children are going to pay the price She describes how it's really no one's fault. It's been this perfect storm, you know, a death by a thousand paper cuts There have been a couple of recent studies that have come out that estimate that one in four teachers are thinking about quitting And that 40% of their colleagues actually did quit so think about that if one in four of our teachers are thinking about it and 40% quit Y'all we are in trouble She provides some suggestions for improving things and none are about pay raises The one I found most compelling and interestingly enough my mom is a retired High school English teacher and she said the very same thing They suggest requiring parent volunteer hours eight per semester Not per kid just eight per semester if you have multiple kids and the rationale is that part of the biggest problems of education could be solved If parents just went into those school buildings and spent time they would see how hard everyone is working To help kids feel safe and successful Community is missing And we've got to bring it back This bill is not the way I Know that this bill is going to be used against Democrats during the election season with statements to say we're against parents Y'all I am a parent that takes my job very Seriously and my child's education very seriously So I want to say right here publicly on the record that I take offense to this I I believe that this bill which doesn't really do anything Substantly except further burden our underpaid and overworked teachers who deserve our respect is not good for our children Being a good parent sometimes means Putting our kids needs Above our own if you agree vote no to this bill. Thank you mr. Speaker. I yield the will Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's none the previous question is ordered We have a minority report and we have the chairman's time 20 minutes by rule for each The chair recognizes representative Holland to give the minority report Thank you mr. Speaker colleagues, I know we're reaching that point in the session when we are here for longer days and we're often scuttling off to the anti-room to have private conversations during the day And so if any of you are looking for some good conversation I would be happy to talk to anyone about the Harlem Renaissance or decimal fraction operations or microorganisms Propositions and conjugations electricity and magnetism the constitution and her amendments or the different between similes metaphors idioms and hyperbole In fact if you remember that Jeff Boxworthy show are you smarter than a fifth grader If anyone has the mobile home version of that game I will challenge you to to a to a duel. Let's see who's smarter than a fifth grader And before you wonder what sort of bizarre reading habits I have It's just that I'm the parent of a fifth grader So all of these topics have been discussed widely in my house over the past few months I Rise today to talk about this bill because I'm part of a small contingent of people in this chamber Who are current parents of K through 12 public school students And it occurred to me that I might be the only person in this chamber who had to come up with a way to make a model of an Animal cell using only edible ingredients a couple of months ago and by the way For cell membrane twizzlers work really well, but red vines probably would have worked better It's been a while since some of you have been engaged in public school So I want to talk about how things have evolved and changed to make sure that there is transparency for parents into the curriculum at the schools The old ways still exist the parent teacher conferences the curriculum night My child still comes home every Friday with a red folder in his backpack that has notices and graded work from the week But the way the school districts can now leverage technology gives me insight into his classroom That I never could have had even 10 years ago With seesaw and Google classroom and infinite campus in ixl and the securely app I have insight into what he does every day Every Sunday evening I can expect to get two messages one from his class home room teacher telling me what they're going to be studying that week And what methods they're going to be using what kind of activities they'll be doing and one from his principal telling me what the siel objectives are going to be for that week And then I sometimes hear from his art teacher or his music teacher or his p.e. teacher So I also know what's going on during his specials time If I have a question or a concern I reach out to his teachers through these apps. I often hear back within the hour If I think my child needs special accommodations I ask for them and they're met every time when the teacher hasn't been able to meet those for me I've been able to escalate it to the principal and that's always worked for me But if it hadn't there's a mechanism for me to escalate it again And I wanted to come up here today and I wanted to be able to say at no time ever before Has there been more transparency into my child's curriculum than there is right now But that would be a lie A little less than two years ago I had more transparency into what happened in my child's classroom than I ever want to have again Because that's where our kids went to virtual school while we tried to mitigate this right of the coronavirus And I sat next to him and I got to see every second in real time what was happening with him and his classmates and his teachers And y'all I was blown away What about a day is notice those teachers had to pivot and learn to instruct in a in a manner that they had never been trained to do to move those kids out of a physical classroom into a zoom classroom A recorder got delivered to my house because the fourth grade music curriculum includes in recorder instruction And if you think I was ever inside my house from 9 30 to 10 10 on Thursday mornings I was not while the fourth grader learned how to play the recorder online And I looked to social media and my email groups and chats with friends and this is what they said We should be paying these teachers a million dollars When the pandemic is over When the pandemic is over we should all chip in and send our child's teacher on a Caribbean cruise From now on my household budget's going to mean sending a case of wine monthly to my child's teacher because I had no idea How soon we forget y'all That was less than two years ago and now We want to burden our teachers we say we don't trust you We need to know everything that you're going to be discussing with our children We need to know it in advance and heaven forbid you deviate from that Heaven forbid one of these kids get super excited about learning about the bill of rights And wants to dive deeper into where they came from. Sorry. You can't teach that now That wasn't part of the curriculum that you submitted to us months ago I'm not going to provide a retread of what my colleagues have already told you line by line in this bill This puts a burden on teachers and creates problematic Contradictions and what we expect from our education system But I gotta tell you we've got a dire short-edged teachers in this state We are having trouble retaining and recruiting not just top talent but talent in general in our schools And this bill does the opposite of fixing that problem I know we have a long day ahead to do some up this bill is not necessary And it inadvertently causes harm to our teachers which by definition causes harm to our kids So on behalf of my child and the children in your communities I'd like to ask you to say no to this bill. Thank you mr. Speaker. I yield the well We're going to have the chairman's time now Chair recognizes chairman Dubnik for the chairman's time 20 minutes Thank you mr. Speaker ladies and gentlemen of the house We'll do my best to get through this today and get my point across and I'm going to start with two words necessity and transparency And I'm going to end with a story about the need for transparency So I hope you'll indulge me for a few minutes This bill is absolutely necessary This is not controversial. This is about parents and parents access to transparency As legislators I don't understand how we could vote against parents rights And I believe parents should have the right to do the following the right to direct the upbringing in the moral or religious training of their child The right to review all instructional materials intended for use in the classroom The right to apply to enroll a child in a public school and alternative to public education a private school Religious school a home study program or other options that are authorized by law and subject to applicable enrollment requirements The right to access and review all records relating to this minor child including but not limited to current grade reports attendance records Unless they're prohibited in other areas of the law The right to access information relating to promotion and retention policies and high school graduation graduation requirements Now let's talk about the purpose of this bill This strengthens parents rights in law Currently most are done by board rule But board rule is easily undone Law is not Board rule is easily undone but law is not currently the law only has student records and student data As information that must be available to the parent this bill puts instructional materials And other information in that same category and let me say this too As it was stated earlier I believe incorrectly This bill does not include ingredients also known as supplemental materials It's just primary materials that are already readily available via locally approved and state board of education approved materials This centralizes and streamlines the process for a parent to get information While providing an alternative to the open records route which cost the parent money It allows access to information not currently accessible to parents under the law And it codifies parents rights and the responsibility of the local school system all in one place Currently the rights and information are all over the code state regulations local regulations And this will make it easier for districts and parents to understand their roles Now the question was posed earlier Why would you still want to be a teacher in Georgia And I would counter that from the place of a parent Would we ever ask the question why would anyone still want to be a parent Absolutely not we would never ask that question This is about parents and students and families And I talked to you about transparency and now I'm going to get personal It was also stated why would we want teachers and administrators to respond to request and interactions for parents Now if you're on the education committee and you're in subcommittee you've already heard my story twice So I apologize hopefully the third times the charm But for the other members who haven't heard my personal story. I'm going to answer that question very directly and very purposefully Why would we want teachers and administrators to respond to interactions To understand what ingredients I'm going to use that analogy that's already given will ingredients hit home right here Because I have a child with severe food allergies Not the kind that we say are preference The kind that are life and death I've been in the hospital to find out that we have those allergies I ask questions about what's in the food who's cooking it where are we going on the field trip Did that child wash their hands after they ate that pizza full of gluten before they threw the football with my child It's about transparency And as a parent I expect and demand answers to things about ingredients in my child's food And I will demand the same transparency in the ingredients that are a part of my child's education And would hope that you would demand the same for your child's education When we go to the hospital We have loved ones who were sick and Lord knows I'm dealing with that on a very personal level right now Would you want to go in and just here we gave you some medicine your wife got treatment and medicine And we hope it works Well doctor what was it? What did you do doc Newton Well, that's a burden to me Mr. Dubnik I Wish you wouldn't have asked that question We demand transparency to advocate For the health care and the well-being of our loved ones You would advocate for your loved one and you would ask about transparency and what was in that medicine I ask about ingredients that are in my child's food And there's a very short list of people That we allow to cook for my child No, why because we're the advocate we need that transparency I'll end with this This is for parents Who care This is our chance as legislators to tell the people of Georgia that we care about them and the rights that they need the rights that they demand And the rights that they deserve To understand what is going on with their child's education This is necessary and this is needed transparency Mr. Speaker thank you for the opportunity to be here and I will yield the balance of my time to others who wish to speak to the bill You Speaker pro timber you speaking to the balance of the time Chair recognizes the speaker pro timber the house To for the balance of the chairman's time Thank you mr. Speaker and and I'll just take a minute before I do I defer to the author of the bill the governor's floor later. I just want to Alay a few fears that have been expressed so that you can feel comfortable voting for this bill Number one current law allows parents to opt their children out of sex education up to the age 18 This bill doesn't change that The legislation also does not change the current definition of sex education and law So have no fear we're not changing that and if you think it's ambiguous Please bring some legislation this year or next I also heard that the the legislation would Foment mistrust between parents and educators Well, I adhere to the old saying trust but verify I would suggest that the bill will lead to more trust Between educators and parents because they'll be aware More of what their rights are as opposed to wondering you know not every parent has the time frankly to To volunteer in their schools. I was one of the lucky ones. I had the time to do that But there are many parents who wish they could give up to eight hours a week or eight hours a semester or a year But they don't have the time many parents are working parents and it's the best they can do to put food on the table And so allowing them to online or through paper documentation know What their instructional instructional materials are what their rights are saves everybody a lot of time and energy and particularly those Who are working the hardest and the single parents um, I'd also like to suggest that It um The the the prospect that it'll lead to more questions by parents You know my gosh is that disturbing that parents might have questions about what their children are learning or how they're learning it I actually think that's a um an indicator of of quality parenting and I would like to do anything that I can to Encourage that whether it's what your child eats or what they're learning in public school um So that there's there's been some Some some have talked about how disturbing it is that teachers will be burdened Because of having to make instructional materials available. I I looked actually in code at what are Instructional materials and these are not supplemental, but these are the materials That are already adopted by the school system or utilized by the school system So first of all it doesn't necessarily mean that a teacher will have to make these materials available That can be made available on the the website my goodness if a school system can make the lunch menu Available every day in day and every day in week of the year I think they can make those instructional materials available Online that the teachers are using that were adopted by the school system or used by the school system And Then the requirement that um You know, we're adding a lot of rights as has been said most of these rights Are already in law and if you don't like them, please bring legislation We can talk about it through the committee process What the bill primarily does is it takes these rights and it just makes sure That those of us who are down here making laws and we might know about them Let's let the people who are subject to these laws that we pass be aware of them And that's the parents whose children are required by law To a ten school whether homeschool private school or in the case of 90% of students in Georgia Public school. I think yeah, I do think they should have be aware of the laws that we pass down here That we all agreed or at least a majority of us agreed that we should put in place on our public schools And again if you don't like them bring it on and let's talk about in the committee process if you already think it's too much of a burden And finally I do want to um Bring up something about the about teachers and how teachers are dissatisfied um You know, I looked at that. I y'all can look it up yourself. Go see the professional standards commission that regulates teacher licensing The teacher leaving rate hasn't changed in 20 years this bill isn't going to change it Now one thing that might help is the pay raise the governor camp has suggested Because we haven't been able to increase keep teacher pay in keeping particularly with the inflation rate we have today But in general over the last 20 years because we have had which took us a long time to come out of the great recession The only time we saw teachers um coming out of teaching education educational institutions not being able to get hired was during a great recession Or a regular recession when we have to increase the class sizes because we don't have the money If you have a solution for that let me know Right now the reason um there are there's tremendous shortage of teachers Is because one we have such an inflation rate that can't they need to go get a job that pays better Maybe you can talk present Biden about working on that Number two Because there are other options that pay better right now out in the marketplace But I encourage you to wait around stick around to the next recession that may change I love our teachers. I think most of us down here do my children had some of the best experiences of their lives and public education in north fulton I don't think this bill is going to increase or decrease teacher satisfaction It certainly doesn't put an additional burden on them What it does do is provide teachers with what with parents with what they should have which is greater access greater input And an ability to be more involved in their schools which I think we would all agree Is a mighty good thing and I would encourage you to vote for this legislation. Thank you Chair recognizes representative bonner now for the remainder of the chairman's time Thank you mr. Speaker and I'll be brief I appreciate all the debate all the comments. I just I had to check with the clerk though just a minute ago because it it seems as though those

that are in opposition to the bill, maybe looking at the wrong bill. Because as I look through House Bill 1178, and I look through the comments that were made by those that spoke in the well, oh, gets this, I could not find what they were talking about. So I would encourage you do not give in to the fear that's been propagated today. I have two kids in college, and I still have two kids at home, one in eighth grader and one in first grader. I have the honor to represent the community that I grew up in. So when I go to take my kids to school each and every day, I'm dropping them off with the people that I went to school with, that I grew up with. I'm interacting with administrators and the board members that I went to school with, I know that I grew up with, and I can tell you, I have no desire to put any one of our teachers, our administrators, our board members, any of those, in any situation where there'd be any kind of punitive action. I would submit to you that if we increase the transparency and the communication between our teachers and our parents, it will actually create an environment that will attract teachers. One of our colleagues discussed one of the roadmaps of success with having volunteers in the classroom, absolutely. I think what this bill does is provide a framework that encourages that. So not to belabor the point, but I would certainly ask for your favorable consideration for House Bill 1178. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none, the committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none, the report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote aye? Those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does the representative McLeod rise? Parliamentary inquiry. As a parent and a grandparent, and once upon a time, a single parent can, I want to know how exactly, I guess I was powerless at that point. Can I be explained how this is going to empower me more than it did 35 years ago and with my six year old grandson today? Chair recognizes representative camp. What purpose do you rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not true that transparency and lesson plans and curriculums by making information more readily available to parents will create a partnership instead of a spectatorship between parents and teachers? If the lady believes that to be true, I'm sure she is sincere in that belief. What purpose does representative Hagen rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Is it true that as a former classroom teacher, that I welcomed parents in my classroom and would not have felt the least bit threatened or burdened by their involvement in their child's education? I'm sure the lady knows that to be true. What purpose does representative Anelo would rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Statue inquiry. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is it not true that this bill would hold teachers and educators to an open record standards far greater than that to which we hold ourselves? If the lady interprets it that way, I'm sure she believes it to be that way. All right, final inquiry here. What purpose does representative McLaureen rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Statue inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that words like transparency and argumentative styles like we're just asking questions? What do you have to hide? Is the same sort of strategy employed by extremists on the election context as well? And that if this chamber had more foresight, it would recognize that it's creating the same kind of mess with base voters with regard to these education issues also that will end up biting us all later when we realize that we've eroded trust and put stress on our institutions to a point that we can't recover from. Is that not true, Mr. Speaker? That was quite a parliamentary inquiry representative. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 1178. The eyes are 98, the nays are 68. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1352. House Bill 1352, by Representative Smith, 133rd to be entitled an act to amend Article 5 of Chapter 12 of Title 44. The official go to Georgia and Tate of Relay in the disposition of unclaimed property, and the system revives for the handling of certain oils this bill I've referred to the Committee on Judiciary that Committee recommends that this bill do pass by Committee substitute. Chair recognizes Representative Smith to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We're working off a Committee of Rules Substitute, LC442Z Road 36S. Ladies and gentlemen, there's a larger of my unclaimed property in the Department of Revenue. And looking at some of the statistics comparing Georgia with the nation and other states, we only return about 9% of that to the claimers. So we want to up that return rate, the national average is 38%. If you use a state for an example, Florida would be a good one. Their return rate is 59%. But this legislation, nothing's been updated in this code since 1990. So that's what we're working here today. This bill, some people ask questions about documents like wills and trust. None of that is destroyed. All those are kept. The records are kept electronically and paper. So none of that's destroyed. We also have companies that actually perform this service, which will give the citizens of state of Georgia another option to go bring their unclaimed property back home to them. It gives a criteria of how those companies register. They do a background check. They, when they do talk to someone about helping them, they have to perform a contract in that contract that states what they will charge. It also states what the amount of money that will go back to the claimant, the citizens of Georgia. So it's laid out specifically. Those people that do have a clean background check and do want to provide that service, they'll pay a $1200 fee. That fee runs for four years. They have to come back and pay that again at the end of that four years. So it's strictly voluntary. This is just another option for our citizens of state of Georgia. I don't know if any of you have had the chance to try to work with the Department of Revenue and go bring some unclaimed property home, interesting process. So also this legislation, the effective date is not until January 1 of 2023. That will give the department some time to update all their records, any kind of computer software that they need to have. But we don't have to worry about jeopardizing anybody. Social Security number, federal ID number, or any important personal background, all that is still kept confidential. So Mr. Baker, I'll be glad to answer any questions and certainly would appreciate your favorable consideration. New yield for questions? Yes, sir. Chair recognizes Chairman Houston, do you ride for a question? Isn't it not true that these companies charge 30% to do this? In the bill that says right now it's 10%, these companies can charge up to 30%. Well, isn't it not true that I provide this to my constituents already by putting a book out in the library's and the County Commissioner's Office about everybody that has money? And isn't it not true we need to make our citizens more alert? And isn't it not true if you get 30% you need to be paying more than $1200 to get in business? Thank you. Yes, ma'am. I appreciate it. And I appreciate you coming to me ahead of time, Miss Penny. I mean, Chairman Houston and talking to me. Thank you very much. Before the yield. I'll yield for one more. Chair recognizes Representative Cannon, do you're left for a question? Thank you, Mr. Speaker, do you yield? Yes, ma'am. How did the Council of Probec Court judges fill about this bill? In the first subcommittee meeting on judiciary, which this bill went through, they were on a Zoom call. They offered information. I want to say it was lines 86 to 88, 101 to 110. We took verbatim their language and put this in the bill. Do you further yield? Yes, ma'am. And so online 148, it implicates the Superior Court of Fulton County. How do they feel about the bill? I cannot speak directly to that because nobody contacted me about line 148. It did pass up. No further questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And I'd ask your favor consideration. Thank you. Have another member that wishes to speak to the bill. Chair recognizes Representative Wilkerson, to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And I would thank the author of 1352 for bringing this bill forward. I expressed some of the same concerns about the percentage. I believe that we need to get people their money back. I think that's important. But I don't think this is the right way to have third parties do it. Other states, I know North Carolina, what they've done, is they made it easier to reclaim your property. So for example, anything up to, I believe, $5,000, you can just send information on who you are, and they send you the money right back. So I think it's a very important issue. And I like the idea about publishing, who has unclean property out there. Because I know right now I go to unclean property, not a war again, search across the country to see if there's any money out there. So I think that what we need to do is make it easier for people to get the money back, not give it to a third party. I think already right now, citizens get confused on what's legitimate public information versus when they get these scam companies. And so I just ask us to basically turn down this bill and then come back with something that actually makes it easier for people to get their money instead of giving it to outside companies. And I ask for you to vote no. And I do thank the author for highlighting this issue, and I yield the well. As yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to withdrawing the committee substitute? The chair here's none. The committee substitute is withdrawn.

All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed to vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 1352. The eyes are 115. The eyes are 47. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1377. House Bill 1377 by Representative Burchette of the 176. And now this is me, Todd, on act to amend Article 1 of Chapter 7 in Title 48. The fiscal to Georgia, Antietta, will relay in general provisions relative to income taxes so as to authorize private causes of action for equitable relief regarding the failure of employers to comply with the revenue provisions regarding employees. This bill ever referred to the Committee on Judiciary. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by Committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Burchette to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, colleagues, for allowing me to come here to present to you. This bill, I'm gonna be brief, because I understand I'm standing between you and lunch. So this bill attempts to address the misclassification issue you had another bill before you earlier this session already, Representative Jones has. And essentially what my bill does here is to say that if there is a business not classifying their employees correctly, it gives a right of action to any person to take them to Superior Court and get an injunctive relief or stop them from acting in that manner. There is no punitive damages. I was capable of getting the business community on board with this concept. And there is a provision in there so as to not make this a weapon that requires that if you take someone to court and believe they're doing this, but you are wrong, you will have to pay attorney's fees on both sides. That is the just of the bill. This is a means to enforce the laws that are already on the books in the state of Georgia, a means to stop this misclassification issue that is pervasive throughout the state. And Mr. Speaker, that's all I have to say. And I'll stay in for questions if necessary. And I'll stay in for questions if necessary. You have a question if you care to yield. Yes, sir. Are you? Chair recognizes Chairman Petrie. For a question to you. Mr. Chairman. Yes, sir. Mr. Speaker, this gentleman you. Yes, sir. Are you? It is not true that employers that are intentionally misclassifying workers is a common problem throughout the state. Yes, sir. I believe so. And this gentleman, further you. Yes, sir. Are you? Is it not true that when we allow that unfettered, that we actually discourage all those employers from following the law and doing it right? I 100% agree with you. Thank you for the question. Thank you. Thank you. This is a provision that would go after the bad actors, the folks that are not following the law. And I encourage your support of this bill and thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield the will. Gentlemen, as yielded the will. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee's substitute? The chair here is none. The Committee's substitute is adopted.
