Well, good morning.
Hope everybody's ready to work today on legislative day

We will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer
by the chaplain after which we will pledge allegiance
to the flag of our country.
Our chaplain this morning will be introduced
by the gentleman from the 19th House District
Representative Joseph Gullet.
Representative Gullet.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Members of the House, I'm so honored today to present to you, Pastor Josh.
He is a lead pastor, Fortified Hills Baptist Church, right in the heart of my district in Dallas, Georgia.
Fortified Hills has a long, rich history, having celebrated their 100-year anniversary back in 2013.
Pastor Josh grew up in Kinesa, Georgia, and graduated from Harrison High School.
He also graduated from Auburn University, as well as the Southern Baptist Theological
Seminary.
He is married to his wife Jessica, and they have four children, three girls and one boy.
Pastor Josh and Fortified Hills Baptist Church are a true asset to Paul and County into
my community, and I'm so happy he's here to join us.
Welcome Pastor Josh.
Like you said my name is Josh Price and I am the lead pastor at Fortified Hills.
That as church has been a great joy and a privilege to be able to serve in that church and in that county.
thankful for the opportunity to be here.
I do, I do want to just say that.
I am thankful that I can be here to let you know
how grateful I am as well for all that you do,
for all the hours and the days and the years
of public service that are represented in this room.
I just want to thank you on behalf of my church
and me and my family as well.
The task before you I know is a big one.
It's often complicated, I'm sure,
in ways that I'm not even aware of,
but I know that you deal with complicated
and big issues on a regular basis.
You have constituents that are varied.
You often, I'm sure, feel pulled in multiple directions.
I may be able to relate to some of that as well as a pastor.
And add to some of that, some of the issues that you address
have some real weight.
The decisions that you make have real impact
on the lives of Georgians all over the state.
And I'm sure there are times then in which
where your jobs feel really demanding
and perhaps overwhelming.
Well, I want to spend just a couple of minutes.
I know I'm a Baptist pastor,
but I'm going to spend just a couple of minutes.
We're going to break the mold here and try and do that
just to encourage you this morning
by simply reminding you that there is a God
who is never overwhelmed,
who knows all that you need
and provides when you need exactly what you need.
There's a passage in Joshua chapter 5, verse 12 that says this,
and the man assessed the day after they ate
of the produce of the land.
And there was no longer mana for the people of Israel,
the ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
Little backstory on that, the Israelites needed food
as they wandered in the wilderness for 40 years.
They had no food, they needed someone to provide it.
And so each day, every day, as they woke up,
God had provided this mana from heaven
that literally their lives might be sustained.
Every day, for 40 years, they went to bed with no food,
they woke up and the Lord had provided exactly
what they needed, right when they needed,
at the very right time that they needed to have it.
Every day, for 40 years, until the verse that I read,
they entered the land that was flowing with milk and honey.
It had all that they needed.
And on that very day, then the manna from heaven ceased.
And I think in a little text like that,
we see something here of the heart and the nature of God.
We see a God who knows what we need,
who provides just what we need,
at exactly the right time that we need it.
No place is this more clear for us
than God's provision of our greatest need.
The forgiveness of our sins that he provides in Jesus Christ.
Again, we see his heart and his nature
as a God who knows exactly what we need
and provides all that we need.
So I just wanna encourage you this day
in the days to come, in the weeks to come, in the months to come, in the years to come,
as you serve, as you work diligently through hard issues, complicated issues, and very
consistency, long days.
There is a God who knows just what you need, who provides all that you need at exactly
when you need it.
Let us pray together this morning.
in heaven, we are a needy people. We are not sufficient in and of ourselves, but ones
who desperately depend on you. And so, God, we are thankful, as we've seen here, even
in this brief little verse, that you are a God who needs nothing and yet has everything,
and you are completely sufficient in and of yourself. And yet you're also a God who
is gracious and generous. And so, I pray for those that are here this morning that they
They might trust in you, lean on you, as they go throughout all the tasks they have this
day and in the days to come.
And God, I pray that as they do that, they would find you to be a God who knows all that
they need, provides just what they need, and exactly when they need it.
We pray these things in the powerful, mighty, and beautiful name of Jesus, amen.
Let's stand and pledge allegiance to the flag.
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for
which it stands one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
More keepers will unlock the doors.

Most of you know I enjoy a good laugh and love to keep things light and such as tense

you in any way and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.
I yield the well.
Chair recognizes the Dean of the House, Dean Smirey, for a morning order.
This speaker and members of the House, I just wanted to come down today. It's Columbus Day, and on behalf of Chairman Richard Smith,
Representative Hugley, Representative Vance Smith, and Representative Buckner.

Mitchell and Pace Holtar, our Chair of our Board of our Chamber, you have a nice charcoal
Barbara, Bobby Cue Kid in here,

So, Mr. Speaker, we just wanted to,
you know, we always have Columbus up here,
but because of COVID, we're not able to visit the Capitol,
but on behalf of our City of Columbus,
our Mayor and our Chamber of Commerce
and Columbus State University and Columbus Tech,
we just want to say thank y'all for y'all's support
of the Columbus community.
On behalf of our delegation, thank y'all very much.
Chair recognizes Chairman Dempsey for a morning order.
Good morning and thank you, Mr. Speaker.
As we focus on National Women's History Month, I want to bring you two incredible ladies
who have been prominent leaders throughout our century.
I want you to just take a moment and look at it.
In case any of you have seen this magazine here,
you should have received the Georgia magazine
from our Georgia EMCs.
On the cover is an incredible woman from Rome, Georgia.
Her name is Jane Tucker.
She's 93 years old, and at the age of 16,
she learned to weld at a shipyard in Savannah
and help build the Liberty Ships for the war effort.
She is one of those rosies.
They're profound.
They walk across all of our avenues and places in life.
Last year, we would have honored them,
but because of the pandemic, I hope that next year,
when it's in our rearview mirror,
we will honor their 102 years of service.
But I want to ask you now to focus
on an incredible educational leader, Martha Berry.
She founded the Berry Schools for the academically able,
but economically poor children,
all throughout rural South Georgia, particularly.
The Berry schools became the model for vocational agriculture
and mechanical schools throughout our world,
showing how the needs of people in poor rural areas
could be met.
Through her schools, she blazed a trail
for the establishment of an agriculture mechanical school
in each congressional district of Georgia.
In the early 1900s, these grew, and within three decades,
This grew into Berry College, a comprehensive,
strong liberal arts college that still exists today.
She traveled widely.
She became an accomplished fundraiser.
Many of the gifts were small, but she also received support
from philanthropist Andrew Carnegie,
Automotive Pioneer Henry Ford,
President Theodore Roosevelt,
and President Woodrow Wilson's wife,
Ellen Axon Wilson, also from Rome.
That wasn't heard of at that time
for a female to go out on her own and ask for contributions.
As you look around here today, you're
in the midst of many who have graduated
or been touched by Barry College.
They've attended, they've graduated,
they have children or family and friends.
Our own Holly Pitcock is one of those special, special
alums from Barry College.
This work is so profound, she taught the value
of appreciating our land and gathered while she was still alive, 30,000 acres that are
part of the campus.
It continues to grow and the motto of head, heart and hand and not to be ministered unto
but to minister can be seen in all of those who have been touched by an education or an
experience at Berry College.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I yield the well.
Chair recognizes the Speaker Pro Tem of the House, Speaker Pro Tem Jones for a morning
order.
Well, thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I want to draw everyone's attention to a brave and determined woman who made a difference
in our state and, frankly, nationally, Charlene Hunter Galt.
She paid the way not that long ago for African Americans to attend Georgia State colleges
and universities and pursued the American dream.
Following graduation from Henry McNeill Turner High School Hunter Goat applied to the University
of Georgia and was denied admission due to her race.
She enrolled at Wayne State University in Detroit, but her battle was not over.
team of civil rights attorneys secured her admission to UGA in January of 1961. It made
her the first black woman to attend the women, the nation's oldest public university.
She graduated from UGA with a degree in journalism from the Henry W. Grady's School of Journalism,
which I'm proud to say I did as well. Following graduation, she led a most successful career
and journalism, which I did not.
Today and every day, we remember women like Charlene Hunter
Gold, who paved the way for Black Georgians
to pursue their dreams of higher education
in our great state.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes representative Glanton
for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and good morning,
ladies and gentlemen of the house. I just came up this morning to say thank you. Thank
you to those of you who have reached out to me doing my health challenges. And thank
you to those who even thought about reaching out to me this morning. And so I want to
say that some folks have been a little concerned and it's not COVID related. So you don't
have to bump air, we can bump.
But also, I just want to see something
that you go through life and different things happen
and you never expect some things to happen,
but they do anyway.
As a military, growing up in the military,
I was master fitness, I was drill sergeant candidate,
and I was paratrooper airborne.
But this has certainly been a humbling experience.
And so while I will be on light duty for a while,
I declare and decree that by his stripes,
I am healed.
So thank you, may God bless you, and may God bless this house.
Go dogs.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Good morning colleagues. On behalf of our Augusta delegation, we are so proud to commend three of our public
high school basketball teams that won championships on last week,
TW Josie Girls, Cross Creek Girls and Boys was the only school that had two teams in
and it was their first championship in school history.
We commend them and thank you so much for your support. We yield the well.
Chair recognizes representative Reeves for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, realizing that I used up years of goodwill yesterday, but I would
be remiss if I didn't come to the world of the day and also pay recognition that yesterday,
the Georgia Tech Lady Yellow Jackets basketball team received a birth to the NCAA tournament.
They're going to be a number five seed, which is four seeds better than our mids program.
It's great that we have the state of Georgia representing us on a national level, good
jackets.
That completes morning orders for today if you have signed up and didn't get reached
and you want to be reached tomorrow then see the messenger.
What purpose does the chairman of the House Rules Committee rise?
Parliamentary inquiry and immediately followed by motion, please.
State your inquiry.
Well, isn't it true that the last words out of my wife's mouth this morning was to play
pretty. And part of the motion is I've moved that Senate Bill 46 be recommitted
back to health and human services.
The I want to party to your conversation with your wife this morning so I hope you listen

for the purpose of hearing a message from the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court inviting

of the joint session and for other purposes.
Ladies and gentlemen of the House and the Senate, it is my distinct honor today to introduce
to you, a dear friend and a distinguished jurist, the Chief Justice of the State of Georgia.
A native of Washington, DC, our Chief Justice grew up in East Point and Marietta.
He attended Auburn University, where he was elected to serve as President of the Student
Senate.
If you visit the campus there today, I'd encourage you to visit the Student Center, which has
fittingly been named in his honor by his alma mater. He earned his law degree from the University
of Georgia in 1991. He spent 11 years with the Department of Law where he dealt with issues
from the creation of the Georgia Lottery Commission to Georgia's Tobacco Settlement.
He later served as Executive Counsel to Governor Sonny Perdue before his appointment
to the Supreme Court in 2005, where he has served with distinction ever since.
It is for all these reasons that I was honored earlier this session to join with the Speaker
Pro Tem of this House, the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader and several Chairman
to sponsor House Resolution 332, honoring Chief Justice Milton on the grand occasion of
his forthcoming retirement after 30 years of service to our state.
So please join with me and his dear wife, Kimberly, as we thank him for his service and
welcome him to our House Chamber, ladies and gentlemen, the Chief Justice of the State
to Georgia, the Honorable Harold Melton.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Lieutenant Governor Duncan, Speaker Ralston, President Pro Tem Miller, Speaker Pro Tem
Jones, Members of the General Assembly, Constitutional Officer is my fellow judges, ladies and gentlemen.
written in big letters above the bench of the Georgia Supreme Court is the Latin phrase
fiat justicia, ruric, calum, translated into English it means let justice be done though
the heavens may fall.
To me this motto has always meant that we who are judges must do the right thing and
uphold the rule of law regardless of politics, the public will, or the consequences.
Now I have another take.
Given this past year, I believe it also means that justice must prevail even when everything
around us is falling apart.
Truth and justice for all must remain front and center, even if we find ourselves in historic
time of great political upheaval, racial and social unrest, and the worldwide pandemic
that has altered our lives.
I thank you for this annual opportunity
to report to the general legislature
the state of this judiciary.
What the courts have accomplished this past year
and where we are headed.
And I thank you for your continued support.
I'm also grateful to Governor Campfour's leadership
and help this past year.
I want to give a special greeting to my lovely wife,
Kimberly, who adjusted her travel plans
at the last minute in order to be here for this moment.
I'll tell you that this is the kind of support and love that she is consistently extended
to me and I do thank you for being with me here on this special day and thank you all
for recognizing her in a special way.
When I stood before you a year ago, I spoke of the pride and hope that I had in our Georgia
judicial branch of government going forward in 2020.
I did not know that three weeks later I would declare a statewide judicial emergency in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic that had reached Georgia's borders.
I did not know that in coming months,
many of us would lose colleagues, friends,
and loved ones to this dangerous disease
or fall victim to it ourselves.
I did not know how hard our courts would have to work
pivot and change in order to uphold justice.
But today, ladies and gentlemen,
I can report to you that going forward in 2021,
the state of our judiciary is sound, solid, and strong.
It is not with Alex challenges and I particularly want to thank you for your support of this legislative
session in helping us to confront some of those challenges.
This past year I have witnessed firsthand that your judges and courts are remarkably resilient,
flexible, creative, and committed in their mission
to uphold the law and meet out justice fairly and equitably.
It has been my honor and one of the highlights
of my professional career to work
with an amazingly cohesive group of justices, judges, clerks,
court administrators, leaders of the state bar, law school
deans, public health officials, sheriff's offices,
and others who have collaborated and cooperated
to keep our courts open and the work of the judiciary
on track, all while going an extra distance
to ensure that people are safe.
Our courts exist to uphold the rule of law.
It is what we are, it is who we are.
The rule of law is the principle that in our nation
and in our state, the law is in charge.
Not a king, not a dictator, but a body of laws.
No one stands above the law
and no one should be treated differently under the law.
In a democracy, our laws must be applied equally
whether you're a weaker, powerful, richer, poor,
white, or of color, young or old,
or of one religion or another.
The rule of law is intended to protect the rights
of the people and to prevent tyranny.
Justice and the rule of law cannot wait on the pandemic.
One year ago, on March 12, 2020, in an emergency phone call, I told Georgia's judicial leaders
that under state law, the chief judge of each judicial circuit had the authority to suspend
jury trials and other court proceedings in response to the COVID-19 virus.
The next day, Fulton County Superior Court Chief Judge Christopher Brascher became the
first to do so.
around the state soon followed suit. Two days later, I declared a statewide judicial
emergency following the lead of Governor Camp. The order took effect immediately and was
due to expire in 30 days as state law required. At that time, we knew of only one death in
Georgia due to COVID-19. The emergency order sign that they required courts to remain open
to address critical or central functions and give priority to such matters as domestic
abuse or straining orders, criminal bond hearings, mental health commitment hearings, and cases
where the immediate liberty or safety concern was present.
The order suspended a number of judicial deadlines and urge courts to begin using video conferencing
where possible as a safer alternative to in-person proceedings.
In the ensuing months, new orders followed every 30 days, extending the statewide judicial
emergency order.
At first we thought this pandemic would be over in a matter of months, and we would go
back to normal.
I certainly never envisioned that we would still be within its grips one year later.
With the help of the administrative office of the courts and director Cynthia Clinton,
we have held emergency virtual meetings almost every week with the judicial council.
The Judicial Council is the policy-making body of the state's judicial branch that is
made up of judges representing every class of court in Georgia.
Those meetings, in those meetings we heard questions that needed to be answered, rules and
laws that needed to be changed and steps we needed to take to get the courts fully operational
during a pandemic.
In a normal year, there are four quarterly meetings of the Judicial Council.
In this past year, there have been more than 30, and they have been extremely productive.
I want to emphasize that from day one of this emergency, Georgia's courts have remained
open, and the work of the courts has continued.
It looks different.
Along the way, I've told judges that if you have to stick a bucket inside the door of
the courthouse to accept the filing and instruct that file or to kick that bucket back and
forth in order to get things going, then do that.
So our courts have not closed.
We've adjusted operations, and there are things that we have not been able to do, but
our courts have not closed.
Our judges have taken an oath to uphold the law, and many will tell you that they go to
bed at night worried about how they can push cases towards resolution without endangering
the public health of all those who come to our court houses.
You should be proud of the many judges in Georgia, in the superior courts, the state courts,
the juvenile courts, the magistrate courts, municipal courts, the business court, and the
appellate courts, who have stepped up this year to go beyond the normal duties, to keep
cases moving as much as possible, and to keep people safe.
In some cases, it has cost them their lives.
Our probate court judges have been particularly hit hard by the virus.
judges have a host of critically important jobs including the emergency
appointment of guardians and the involuntary hospitalization of incapacitated
as adults and other dependent individuals. Ensuring care for those who
cannot care for themselves cannot wait until the end of a pandemic. Among
probate judges we lost this year from COVID-19 our judge Karen Baton of
Brantley County, described by a probate counsel president, Kelly Wulk, as a
genuinely kind soul. Judge Nancy Stevenson of Dirty County, a judge who loved
and served her community of Albany, a community which loved her back. And
Judge John Payne of Chittuga County, a veteran of the U.S. Marines, and the
former Sheriff's Deputy, who was elected Chittuga County probate judge at the
age of 25 and remained a probate judge for the next 45 years until he was struck down by the
coronavirus. We lost my dear friend and colleague, former Chief Justice George Carly to the virus.
Another former Chief Justice Norman Fletcher lost his beloved wife, Dott.
In superior court judge Horace Johnson of Covington, a bright shining star left us way too early.
after collapsing only hours after holding a virtual court hearing from his home.
And even though he tested positive for COVID-19, Judge Johnson continued doing his sworn duty until the end.
In addition to these countless of judges and staff deputies, prosecutors, and public defenders,
and others in our court family, many have contracted the virus, but survived COVID-19.
I know a number of you have suffered similar losses, and maybe you've even had the virus
yourselves. I want to thank you for still being here and showing up to do the great business
of this great state. Thank you.
In the first month of the emergency order, the Supreme Court of Georgia like other courts
canceled courtroom sessions that were scheduled for March 2020 for our arguments.
But my colleagues and I, thanks to our first-rate IT staff, quickly adapted to the use of Zoom
video conferencing technology as the attorneys who argued before us.
And with the exception of March, the state's highest court has not missed a single month
of oral arguments.
The cases canceled in March were added to the April calendar and we have continued to
stay on track.
Our court of nine justices continues to meet regularly and virtually to decide cases.
And the number of opinions we issued remained about the same as in the last two years.
We issued 265 opinions from April through December in 2020 compared to 261 opinions during
those same months in 2019.
At the beginning of the emergency, one bright spot was the governor's appointment last
March of a New Justice, Judge Juan McMillan of the Georgia Court of Pills, who took
the seat of the retired Justice Benham.
Justice McMillan is the first Asian American ever appointed to the State's highest court,
and she has been a welcome addition.
Although the number of cases argued before the court has slowed during the pandemic, the
work of the court has increased because of the pandemic.
I'm so grateful to my colleagues,
presiding Justice David Namius,
former Justice Keith Blackwell,
Justice Michael Boggs, Justice Nails Peterson,
our clerk of court, Ms. T. Barnes,
our chief deputy clerk, Ms. Tia Milton,
who formed our internal working group
to lead our judicial branch through this crisis.
Among many changes,
among many changes, we amended the court rules,
trial court rules to allow for virtual hearings
through video conferencing technology
in proceedings that normally require
the physical presence of the judge and parties.
We also replace the in-person Georgia Bar Examination
with an online bar exam to avoid having hundreds of people
sitting for hours in close quarters.
This took enormous effort, and I'm thankful
to all those involved, former Justice Blackwell,
Justice Peterson, the board of bar examiners,
the office of barred missions under the leadership of Heidi,
Fyanzah, and the deans of all five of our law schools.
We have successfully administered two remote barred exams,
one in October and one last month,
testing a total of more than 1,800 applicants
who now have a path of licensure to practice law.
I also want to thank Governor Camp and his staff
who helped us in making some of these changes.
The governor responded to us immediately last April by issuing an order that now allows
notaries to certify documents remotely rather than in person.
From the beginning of this pandemic, our greatest challenge in the judiciary has been jury
trials.
When people think of the courts and court business, most think of jury trials, the kind of things
we see on TV.
Indeed, jury trials are the hallmark of our American system of justice, a fundamental constitutional
right in a criminal case to be tried by a jury of your peers. Early on, we suspended jury
trials due to the number of people involved, the length of the trials, and especially due to
the number of citizens needed to be summoned in order to have jury selection.
The public health risks to all involved was significant.
At that time, we were seeing COVID outbreaks in Georgia and across the nation, where large
numbers of people were gathering inside close quarters, such as they do for a jury trial.
The decision to open jury trials is different than opening businesses.
Unlike when individuals choose whether they visit a store or a gym or a restaurant, when
The citizen receives the jury summons.
That is not an invitation.
It is an order.
We compel people to come to court.
It is therefore been critical that when we summoned jury
trials, we did it the right way,
with the necessary safeguards in place
to protect the public health and safety of the lawyers,
the judges, the jurors, the clerks, the bailiffs,
the sheriff's deputies, court reporters, witnesses,
defendants, parties, and all the many people we require to be present for a trial.
But we suspended jury trials at a real cost, and we recognized that we could not suspend
them indefinitely, even during a pandemic.
Unindicted criminal cases have been building, and there are many individuals in jail who have
been waiting for more than a year under the presumption of being innocent until proven guilty.
In addition to criminal trials, many people are awaiting resolution of weighty civil
matters, including cases that involve business disputes and personal injuries and divorces
and child custody.
In mid-October, I signed an order lifting the suspension of jury trials.
Not too long after that, we reopened jury trials, however, the number of coronavirus cases
spiked.
And in December, we had to shut down jury trials again.
Since then, our courts have been accumulating more cases, more than those that have been
accumulating more cases than our waiting in diamond and trial.
The potential backlog in cases is staggering and we must find a way to reduce the growing
pressure.
So one week ago, after the number of coronavirus cases, sharply declined, I again signed
an order authorizing the resumption of jury trials in Georgia.
After this order, before jury trials may resume, courts must have written plans in place
to ensure that jury trials can be conducted safely and in conformity with public health
guidance.
I'm grateful for the leadership of former Fulton County Superior Court Judge Charlotte
Grueh, now Justice Grueh, the most recent appointee to the State Supreme Court.
She and Chief Judge Russell McClellan of the Forsyth County State Court together have
of co-chair the Judicial Council's COVID-19 Task Force
that I appointed last May.
Since then, they've been working diligently
on the particulars of getting the courts fully
and safely operational during and after the pandemic.
These two leaders have marshalled the resources
of the judges appointed to that task force
and divided them into subcommittees
to address various issues.
They brought in clerks and civil and criminal lawyers,
public health experts and others as advisors.
Among them was Dr. Mark Swain cut
of the Fulton County Board of Public Health
who has been an invaluable source of wise counsel.
Together, these professionals, all volunteers,
have created guidelines on how courts must operate
to ensure safety for in-person proceedings,
including jury trials.
They started with one question,
how can we keep everybody safe?
The plans that courts must have put in place prior to resuming jury trials cover everything
from where people part to how they walk into the building, how they line up to go through
security, how they ride the elevators and walk through the halls or visit the restaurants.
On the day of the trial, the court will look different than it has in the past.
Protocols include pre-screening for health risk of all parties, temperature checks, use
of mass, social distancing, plexiglass barriers, touch-free evidence technology, constant
surface cleaning, and the reconfiguration of courtrooms and jury spaces to ensure social
distancing. You may see spectators in one courtroom and participants in another, also that
we can accommodate social distancing. In some cases, court will be held in a different
building altogether. These changes are well underway all across the state. We
are of course hopeful that the widespread vaccination of citizens will help
put it into this pandemic, but we're not there yet. And even when that day
comes, our courts will face a huge challenge, one for which we will need your
help. As I said before, we've gone essentially one year without jury trials.
Although judges across the state have worked hard to keep the trial and the jail
populations down, there still remains a large number of inmates still sitting in jail waiting
for their cases to be heard.
And although we now have lifted the suspension of jury trials, it could take up to one and
possibly three years to dig out of the backlog.
Not only will we have significantly more cases, but the process of moving those cases through
the system, at least initially, will go more slowly due to the safety protocols.
As we resume jury trials, if we're only able to move at a third of the pace, we will
be relieving some of the pressure, but the backlog will continue to grow.
Fulton County has the largest court system in this state.
In a ten-month period, the number of defendants in jail without being indicted grew from 230
to roughly 1,400.
At the same time of the 40 courtrooms normally used in Fulton County for trial courts, only
two are large enough to hold an array of prospective jurors while accounting for social distancing
and public health precautions.
Throughout the pandemic, we have suspended the statutory speedy trial deadlines as a part
of our statewide judicial emergency.
Once the governor ends the public health emergency,
by law, the judicial emergency must also end.
Under the Georgia statutory law,
if a defendant files a speedy trial demand,
the court has only a few terms of court
to try that person.
And if it fails to meet that deadline,
the defendant is automatically acquitted and released.
Fulton County and other large counties
have terms of court there are only two months long.
Imagine what would happen in Fulton County
if those 1,400 inmates
went indicted all filed speed trial demands.
The avalanche of demands would overwhelm the court system
and a sizable number of defendants
would be acquitted and released without trial.
We realized the burden of having defendants
waiting longer for trial while being in jail.
But we need to have a system that actually determines
whether people who have been charged
and indicted with a crime
are guilty or innocent before allowing them to walk free.
So we need your help to avert this crisis.
We're also very grateful to the Georgia General Assembly
for your support for House Bill Senate Bill 163,
which is designed to address the situation.
This legislation will allow trial courts in some counties
to continue to suspend statutory speedy trial deadlines
until those deadlines could reasonably be met.
Constitutional speed trial rights are not affected.
And this legislation has a sunset date,
so we're targeting this legislation
to allow us to get through this backlog.
This legislation is the highest priority
of the Judicial Council and the Georgia courts
and Georgia Superior and State courts.
And we have proposed other legislation
that will help us well to get through the backlog.
All these legislative proposals
are supported by the Judicial Council
and we appreciate the amount of consideration
that you have given them.
I've mentioned to you before,
our courts have had to pivot and change,
like many of your businesses in our society.
Probably the biggest change in how our courts operate today
has come through the use of technology.
And many of our judges have surprised even themselves
by how proficient they have become.
In every judicial order that I've signed,
We have encouraged courts to switch from in-person
court proceedings to video conferencing
where legally and practically possible.
Many of our courts rose to the occasion
and seemed to have turned on a dime.
As president of the Council Superior Court Judges,
Chief Judge Brian Amaro of Henry County
pushed for the immediate acquisition of WebX licenses.
So Superior Court Judges around the state
could increase their use of video conferencing.
Today, 238 licenses are now in use by judges all over Georgia.
Under Chief Judge Brascher, the Fulton County Superior Court,
Fulton County courts have built a huge infrastructure
around Zoom with more than a dozen Zoom stations
at the Fulton County jail,
so that judges can conduct aramance and plea hearings
without having to transport defendants.
Pre-COVID, the county was busing 200 inmates a day
to the courthouse involving an enormous security undertaking.
Today, they transport an average of less than 12 a day.
I believe that this is one of the types of changes
that may become permanent.
We have learned a great deal during this pandemic,
and we need to continue using some of the things
that we've learned to make us better and efficient.
There are other types of hearings I believe
that we will continue to conduct virtually.
We have learned that it probably doesn't make sense
to require an attorney from Savannah
to travel to Atlanta for 15-minute status conference
with a judge, where the judge will simply ask,
how are we looking?
What do you think we're gonna be ready for trial?
The client really shouldn't have to pay for that.
That could be easily conducted virtually.
One of the many heroes during this pandemic
has been Chief Judge Rob Lunner
of the Cobb Judicial Circuit.
As chair of the COVID-19 Task Forces Technology Committee,
he has led the judiciary on technology matters
and helped many of our judges become more savvy and capable.
Judge Leonard took it upon himself
to create a library of video tutorials
to help judges learn how to do Zoom
and other virtual proceedings.
He's made use of technology understandable and accessible,
and we are very grateful to him.
I also want to mention a few more judges who thank them
for their dedication and leadership and creativity.
Newton County's probate court judge and chief magistrate
Judge Melanie Bell, member of our COVID-19 task force,
became sick with the virus early in the pandemic.
So sick that she spent four days in the hospital.
But she recovered and has since become a beacon of hope
and vigilance for the judiciary, stressing
that this crisis has brought Georgia's judges together
in a collaboration like never before.
After his son contracted COVID-19,
Cobb County Superior Court Judge Tain Kell
conducted virtual hearings
from a makeshift courtroom in his bedroom,
complete with an American flag.
Under the leadership of Judge Dale Bubba Samuels
of Monroe and Judge Willie Weaver of Albany,
the Council of Municipal Court Judges early on developed
best practices and guidelines for operating municipal courts to ensure the safety of the
public and court and court staff coming into the core houses.
Chief Judge Norman Quadra of Swanning has lost three family members to COVID, yet continues
to stand out as a leader on the COVID-19 task force working with interpreters and court
reporters.
Chief Judge Osso Jackson of the Cab Cab County Superior Court has been an innovative force
on the COVID-19 task force and with a judiciary as a whole, she recognized early on the importance
of improving ventilation in the courtrooms and made that a priority for change.
This pandemic has had some unexpected consequences within the criminal justice system beyond
how the courts are adapting.
One of the effects of the pandemic has been an increase in mental health problems, drug
abuse and suicide, both among those who come before our courts and those who work within
the judiciary.
People with mental illness or substance abuse or both are already considered a vulnerable
population.
They have needs which are typically unmet in which are driven up and which drive up their
risk for criminal activity or suicide.
Since the pandemic, many therapy and support group meetings have shut down and this isolation
and lack of interaction has contributed to their problems.
Yet in Georgia, our accountability courts or specialty courts, dealing with drug courts,
mental courts, and others are thriving.
The work of the professionals and judges in these courts has been unwavering throughout
this past year.
I've been amazed at their dedication and perseverance that they've stepped up to go
the extra mile. Accountability court team members have maintained critical
contact with program participants by visiting them at their homes, not only to
confirm that they are staying away from drugs and alcohol, but also to ask how
are they doing and whether they need anything. The courts have helped keep
participants connected by setting up treatment groups who can meet virtually
and by conducting Zoom status hearings with judges. These participants know that
the judges and staff are invested in their lives because they meet with them virtually every
week for a minimum of 18 months. Some judges have begun returning to in-person group therapy
sessions using masks and alternative sites, including meeting outdoors when the weather
has been good. Superior court judge Stephen Kelly of the Brunswick Digital Circuit has
been holding felony drug court in a gymnasium. Georgia now has 169 accountability
courts. That's up from 72 in 2011. Chief Judge Kathleen Goslin of the North
Eastern Judicial Circuit has been a solidifying voice as leader of the
Council of Accountability Court judges in continuing to further development of
Georgia's specialty courts. Even during a pandemic, six new accountability
courts are preparing to begin operations in the next year.
Georgia's accountability courts help fuel our economy.
Each graduate has a positive economic impact of $22,129
based on the amount of money saved from avoiding sending
that person to prison, as well as other avoided cost.
If you take that $22,129 and apply it to the
$1,841 participants who graduated last year,
That's more than a $40 million in in positive economic impact to the state of Georgia
We appreciate the support that you give and continue to give to these courts
We've also realized during this past year the psychological impact the viruses had on
the already stressful legal profession
In October of 2020 we lost an assistant district attorney in Columbus, Georgia to suicide
I don't know what role COVID played in that, but a recent academic study supported the
association between several COVID related experiences and suicidal ideation and attempts.
These findings underscored the need for access to mental health services during a pandemic.
We know from research that connected this to others has been identified as an important
protective factor in preventing death by suicide.
Throughout the pandemic, we in the legal community have been working to foster connectivity
among its members and raise awareness of available services.
In April 30 of this year, the Chief Justice's Commission on Professionalism under the leadership
of Ms. Carly's career will hold a suicide awareness program statewide.
We want to make the case that death by suicide is preventable.
We want to assure members of our legal community that is okay to ask for help.
I began talking to you today about justice and the rule of law, and I wish to conclude
on that topic.
In this past year, our world has been rocked by a pandemic.
My friend, Chief Judge, been stuttered of the Henry County State Court believes history
will call 2020 the year of the pandemic. But he also believes that 2020 will go
down as the year as of the call for justice. I like to think that we are in
historic time of opportunity and reconciliation. I've often said that at
bottom of the social unease we are experiencing is an assistance on the rule
of law. That's what we are all asking for. That is the true promise of our
judicial system. Both the pandemic and the social unrest of this past year call
for an even greater fidelity to the rule of law, not less, but more. My friends,
I believe that every growth spur in our nation's history, moving us closer to the
promise of liberty and justice for all, has come only after some degree of
strife and turmoil. What gets us to the next level is when people of good will
do the necessary soul work, soul searching and put on the shield and do the work that it takes.
I believe that a year from now when my successor delivers the next state of the judiciary address
in this Howard Hall, life will be different. We can only speculate about what will return to
the way it was and what will not. But one thing I'm sure of, regardless of what will be in the
the win on that day, Georgia's judiciary will remain steady and fully committed to the
rule of law. That will not change. It has been one of my greatest privileges of my
life to serve the last 16 years as a justice on the state's highest court. In preparation
for my departure from the court on July 1, last week my colleagues voted unanimously
to name presiding justice David Domes as your next chief justice. Justice Michael Boggs
will succeed him as presiding justice. There are no two more able. Our state is
extremely fortunate to have them in these roles. A reporter recently asked me
what I will miss most when I step down from the bench. I did not hesitate the
people. My colleagues are court staff, the judges I've gotten to know, and I'll
miss you, the many legislators with whom I've worked over the years. It has
been such an honor. Thank you for that honor. May God bless you, may God bless your families,
and may God bless the state of Georgia.
At this time I will ask the doorkeeper to escort the Supreme Court justices and their
distinguished guests from the chamber.
Members of the House, we have been honored to be joined today by some distinguished friends
