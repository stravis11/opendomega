You live and to be able to smile, to be able to say, hallelujah, amen.
My pastor is Reverend Dr. Joseph Evans at Friendship Baptist Church.
I'm going to give you a brief history of him.
He's the Dean of Morehouse School of Religion.
an associate professor at their interdenominational
Theological Center also in the AUC Center.
He's formerly the Mount Carmel Baptist Church pastor
in Washington, D.C.
He was a four sport letterman in high school.
He played football at West Virginia Tech.
He's also a Kappa Alpha Sai.
He's an Army officer.
He jumped for the Army.
He has a master of divinity and systemic theology
at Ph.D. in preaching.
He's done several publications.
His last one is the polished king,
living words of Martin Luther King.
He also has the honor of being the Morehouse College,
Martin Luther King, Jr., College of Preachers.
His wife is Miss lovely Patricia Lewis Evans.
He has two children, Gabriel, who is in New Orleans
and his son Matthew works for the New York Knicks
and he has three grandchildren.
It was important for me to bring my pastor up here.
As we all know that this is a difficult place to be in
and if you have a pastor that can pray with you
at my church, the pastors are very personable.
So I call my pastors nearly every day
can say can you please pray with me and so without further ado, I'd like to introduce
Mr. Reverend Dr. Pastor Evans.
Thank you so much.
Mr. Speaker, Majority and Minority Leaders to the members of this esteem and the Gus
body. It's a privilege responsibility to share common prayer with you today. My
prayer, how prayer, is for the welfare of the citizens of Georgia. Now I define
welfare as our defense of democracy and its obligations and rights. In short
hand if our laws don't fit the welfare of my mama, it may need reform. And I want to thank you so
very much. Misha, Mena, let this house know that I support you and I want y'all to treat her right.
I have evidence that you need improvement.
The only thing worse than a Baptist lawyer is a Baptist preacher who has you in his sights.
Make certain that you do not mistreat.
Representative Manor, I support and love her.
Now with that, let us go to God in prayer of all who stand. Thank you.
Oh God,
we ask now that your presence
be felt and known
in this place
and we pray
that your spirit fill this
chamber and transform it into a sanctuary. The sanctuary where truth will be
defended with civility and sophistication and with passion. We brave
reach member here that represents the great state of Georgia which is the
democratic space or place in the universe. The whole world is watching Georgia.
I have faith and confidence in the people of this chamber to do that which I have described
as defending democracy. Our rights and privileges as citizens include our voting, our ability to go
to the poles without any hindrance, regardless of party, that is minuscule, it does not matter.
What matters is we have the rights to do, to vote as our conscience permits us, leads us.
Now we ask these things to keep us for the majority of this day.
Do not let my words fall on deaf ears as I take my seat, but let them probe our hearts
as we make decisions for the citizens of the state of Georgia.
Now with these words, we ask it in God's name and for His sake, amen.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
You may do the pledge of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands.
One nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
Thank you, sir. Thank you very, very much.

Chair recognizes for a morning order
representatives Roba Show representative
McClarin, Speaker-proteem Jones, and Chairman Martin for a morning order.
There, see who she is.
I'm sorry everyone the city of Roswell lost one of their own on February 3rd Lieutenant
Joe Ruff of the Roswell Police Department was a dedicated husband, father, son, brother,
and friend to many, and he would be surely missed.
Joe was survived by his wife, Jennifer, his four children, Alexis, Ariana, Landon, and
Liam, and two grandchildren.
Joe was a graduate of Roswell High School
and decided from an early age
that he wanted to follow in his grandfather
and his great-grandfather's shoes in law enforcement.
He began his law enforcement career
at the tender age of 17,
being part of the Roswell Police Explorers Youth Program.
And then at the age of 21,
he was sworn in as a police officer for Roswell.
He served first as a detention officer,
then he was a street patrol officer.
He next became a detective in our criminal investigation unit.
And then he assisted in multiple cases across the state
and also in cases with the FBI and the DEA.
He was most recently promoted to the status of Lieutenant.
As you can see, Joe knew in his heart
that service to our Roswell community was his calling.
He was the definition of a servant leader in our community.
He gave his all to our community,
but was also known for his easy smile,
his infectious laugh,
and his love of the legendary rock band Pink Floyd,
which was played at his services yesterday.
Lieutenant Ruff now watches over his family
and the entire city of Roswell from above
and we are better for it.
Please join us in a moment of silence
to honor Lieutenant Ruff.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes Representative Hagen
for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
It is an honor
and a privilege to serve here.
And I know you all feel exactly the same way.
But we also do sacrifice things back home when we're here.
And like birthdays, a family member.
So today is my son Henry's 18th birthday.
And it's the only birthday I've ever missed.
Hope there'll be a few more in the coming years.
But I just wanted to wish him a happy birthday.
He's a wonderful young man.
We love him so much.
I was so proud of him.
He just made Eagle Scout a couple of weeks ago.
So I feel like his future is bright.
He better be registered to vote right now.
That's where he should be.
But thank you for just, let me get up and wish my son Henry
a happy eight to birthday today.
Thank you Mr. Speaker, today I rise for a black history moment.
Miss Amanda Dixon was a biracial socialite in Georgia who became known as one of the
wealthiest African American women of the 19th century.
She was born in Sparta, Georgia, Hancock County.
At her father's death in 1885, Amanda Dixon inherited his estate.
Her quite relatives chalised the wheel, but Amanda ultimately won a successful ruling
in the case.
Her estate included 17,000 acres of land in Hancock and Washington counties in Georgia.
Amanda died on June 11th, 1893.
Thank you, Ms. Speaker, I yield the will.
Chair recognizes Chairman Cooper for a morning order.
Sorry, Mr. Speaker.
Ladies and gentlemen of the House,
today is recognized by the governor,
is Georgia dental hygienist day.
And the proclamation, it's our appreciation
for what they do for us and the citizens of our state.
And you notice you've got a nice gift from them
on your desk, dental hygiene is so extremely important.
One example, and you never think about it,
if pregnant women would gargle
with a non-alcoholic mouthwash twice a day,
there is evidence to show that it is one of the things
that helps premature deliveries.
So dental hygiene is so important,
and our dental hygienists do so much for our state,
and not only working in dental offices,
but doing a great deal of pro bono work
with our most needy citizens, especially our children.
So if you see a dental hygienist out today,
anywhere in the halls, please tell them, thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes Chairman Jasper's for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
First, just about thank those of y'all who went and met with your 4-8 years yesterday.
There are 500 of them here at the depot.
Secondly, it's a month.
We've got to get your paperwork in, your letters of non-opposition or whatever it is called
and the fancy word, to get your road naming done.
We only have five of them right now.
And I know a number of y'all have asked me about it.
This is the road map to getting it done.
Please drop by my desk.
Every day in our office is fabulous
about helping you do that, getting the letters,
getting everything done, your notification.
But we've got to have it to be able to move it.
So we need it done by March the 9th,
because time is moving just about a month from now.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes representative Nelson
for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good morning, colleagues.
I bring you a moment in black history today.
The Lucy Crappelaine in Museum is the only African-American
museum in the central Savannah River area.
The small house museum was the former home of Miss Lucy
craft lady who founded the first school for black boys and girls in Augusta, Georgia.
Ms. Laney dedicated her life to provide educational opportunities for black youth in the Augusta
area.
She was the founder of the Haines Norman Industrial Institute, which was located on the
present site of the Lucicie Laney Comprehensive High School, the Haines Normal Industrial
Institute.
She started the first kindergarten for black children in Augusta and founded the Lamar School
of nursing for black women. The lucid-laden high school, Laney Walker Boulevard, and the
Laney Walker Museum have all been named in Ms. Laney's honor, and I am a graduate of
the lucid-laden high school. Thank you and I yield the wealth.
Chair recognizes representative Weigh-Dower for a morning order.

year over 2,700 costs carrying compassion volunteers, advocated for 10,000 children in
our state's legal custody, providing each child with an impartial advocacy that nurtured
hope, sought solutions, and protected their best interests.
Casa volunteers play a critical role in ensuring children who experience abuse and ornical
act have opportunities to reach their full potential with the support of permanent connections
to family.
We recognize Casa volunteers for giving their time, commend Georgia Casa, and local
costs organizations for maximizing resources and support
through increased community involvement and awareness,
local and state advocacy efforts,
and more coordinated, compassionate response
to child victims and families and crisis.
Today we welcome a small group of costs of advocates
to the Capitol who come to shed some light
on the critical issues facing children and foster care.
I hope if you see them around,
you get a chance to visit with them,
and certainly thank them for their service
to George's most vulnerable children.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
We yield the well.
Chair recognizes Chairman Carpenter
and Representative Cantrell for a morning order.
All right, folks, thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Today is new American celebration day at the Capitol.
It's the ninth annual celebration
where folks downstairs will be getting
their citizenship today.
It's a great day for these folks
as they pursue the American dream
and add a lot of value to our communities.
I come from a district that has 23 different nationalities
in it and I can tell you from firsthand experience
what value they bring to our community.
Thank you, Speaker, and I yield the well.
Chair recognizes representative Scofield
for a morning order.
Wait a second.
Representative Sclaughill.
She's going to wait.
All right, we're going on now to the rules calendar.
Going on to the rules calendar, if you have a bill on the rules calendar, be prepared
to present it.
We'll go read the caption to House Bill 1049.
House Bill 1049, one representable hood of the 175th
and others to be totalled and act to amend
chapter 27 at the final 43, the fish go to Georgia
and Tate, relating nursing home administrators,
so as to revise the composition of state board
of nursing home administrators.
This bill that we serve the committee on
health and human services that committee recommends
that this bill do pass.
Chair recognizes Chairman LaHood to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the House.
House Bill 1049 adds two members to the State Board of Long-Term Care Facility Administrators.
Expanding the board's membership will take the total number from 9 to 11 board members.
What this does is pretty simple, it just allows the governor to appoint members that will
broaden the representation of long-term care providers to cover all sizes and geographic
locations.
I would appreciate your favourable consideration, and Mr. Speaker, if there are no questions
I will yield the will.
You have questions if you care to yield.
I will take one question.
recognize as representative Bentley to your left for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. There's a gentleman you. Yes. Is it not true that what I'm
about to say is I see you. Is it not true that what I'm about to say is not a
question but more so a comment just for awareness purposes. I believe that to
be true.
And my comment is that although I am going to support this bill to allow at more members
to the nursing home administration board, we're in the funeral industry just want to make
certain that nursing homes across the state are aware that it's very important that they
are very mindful of when they make those very sad calls to families when someone passes
away and the family give them the name of a mortuary to call that they are very mindful
of making sure they call the right mortuary because that creates a lot of problems for
their families going forward when the wrong funeral home is contacted.
Is that not true, Mr. Representative Lehu?
I believe that to be true and I believe that would be a great best practice for providers
to do that.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Mr. Speaker, I yield the well.
Gentlemen, as yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?

House Bill 412 by Representative Dempsey
of the 13th and others to be entitled back to amend
Title 43, the official go to Georgia Antietta
relating to professions and businesses.
So as to provide for the licensure of individuals
in the practice of applied behavior analysis,
this bill I refer to the committee on regulated industries.
That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute.
Chair recognizes Chairman Dempsey to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good morning, friends, here in the House.
Today, I bring you an important measure as we all continue to deal with the issues
confronted by behavioral health in our communities and with people you love.
This is something that can greatly help.
House bill 412.
I want to direct you to the piece of paper on your desk
from Marcus Autism Center,
a trusted source and resource within our state.
It breaks down very specifically what a behavioral
analyst does and how important it is.
The practice of applied behavioral analysis
is a distinct profession requiring
distinct training and competencies.
It treats autism, geriatric patients,
traumatic brain injuries, developmental disabilities a word.
I should be able to say better than that after all of this time.
But it deals with those measures.
This is a consumer protection and public safety measure,
which also allows for Medicaid billing.
As an increasing number of private for-profit providers
are moving into Georgia and establishing businesses.
This will protect not only the person who is being served,
but the parent or loved one who is making sure
those services are appropriate to make sure
that they are licensed, credentialed,
they have studied, passed the appropriate exams,
take regular certification steps to do that.
It allows for an assistant behavior
and an analyst as well.
And if you, just an example of this, and this is one that I think of so much, and it does
go back, because I know it's confusing when you start talking about these measures.
Someone who has autism, a young child, I remember the first time I visited Marcus, I watched
someone working with a child who was not able to eat.
They had a feeding tube, that sensory deprivation that exists for many people who have brain
differences. That behavioral analyst works in a positive way, reinforcing step after
step, but with great patience. This one was particularly teaching the parent as well.
At the same time, how you can introduce and keep working and keep working, and eventually
a child who has never eaten may take a long time, but will be able to do that. It is a
The slow, arduous, very sensitive process, and we need to treat it that way.
This measure went through Gork, it was introduced last year, it was approved by Gork, it was
also approved in committee, and I hope that you will support the licensing, the development
of the board, which also will create for penalties for those who come into our state and are
are not certified and the limited reciprocity that will allow for temporary licenses.
If there are any questions, Mr. Speaker, I will take them.
If not, I will yield the wealth.
You have a number of questions if you care to yield.
I will.
Chair recognizes representative Wolenski.
Do you are left for a question?
Thank you, Speaker.
Does the gentle lady yield?
I do.
Is it not true that I thank you for carrying this bill and the creation of a certification
for behavior analysis is very much needed.
And we'll definitely make it safer
for individuals who use this services in their home.
The gentleman knows of what he speaks.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You further you?
I do.
Chair recognizes representative Al Williams
to your left for a question.
Thank you for speaking with the lady.
You.
I certainly will.
Is it not true that I support this bill?
And the only question I have, and I don't expect you to answer,
they haven't read the whole bill,
but the qualifications, what are they to,
there are a lot of unqualified counselors around.
There are, and you know, and I will say this too,
having ABA therapy does not mean that you might not
also need other therapies.
Someone might need speech, they might need occupational,
as well, but they are specifically listed in the bill,
the training, the education, the testing,
and it is in compliance with the national rating
of this as well, the national certification.
Well, the general lady, for the guild.
I will.
It's not true that my niece and Goddaughter is artistic,
and I think this is a great build
to make sure everybody talks,
knows what they're talking about.
Thank you so much.
It has saved many a young life and made life better
for those who are in their senior twilight years as well.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I will yield the well and ask for your favourable consideration.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
The Chair, here's none.
The previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute
to Chair, here's none.
The committee substitute is adopted.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee,
which was favorable to the passage of the bill.
The chair here's none the report of the committee has agreed to.
Shall this bill now pass?
All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye.
Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine.
I have all members voted, I have all members voted.
So the clerk will lock the machine.
On the passage of House Bill 412, the eyes are 158.
The nays are three.
This bill having received the requisite constitutional
majority is therefore passed.
Clerk will read the caption.
The House Bill 430.
House Bill 430, Governor of the Senate,
Apollo 32 to be titled back to amend chapter 26
Title 43, the Fisher-Coda, Georgia, annotated relating to nurses,
so as to provide for a licensure of advanced practice registered nurses.
This bill then referred to the Committee on Regulated Industries.
That committee recommends that this bill do pass by Committee Substitute.
Chair recognizes Chairman Allen Powell to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and the ladies and gentlemen of the House to bring you this morning
House Bill 430.
Pretty simple bill, ladies and gentlemen, that allows for the state nursing board to do
specific licensure for APRNs.
Right now, currently the licensing board, the nurses licensing board, authorizes LPNs
and registered nurses.
This takes it a step forward to allow those that have credentials that are considered
to be APRians and those other nurses that fall within that guideline to be specifically
licensed as an APRian.
Georgia has about 19,000 APRians as I understand it and we're only one of 11 states that does
not allow for specific licensure for those nurses.
that I think speaks well because probably one of the unsung heroes that we have in this
healthcare delivery system are the nurses or as somebody all may have heard me say over
the years they're the ones who keep the doctors from killing us.
But because of the lack, because of the shortage of medical practitioners, these APR answer
critical just as the PAs are in this day and time. Except for you, Doc. This bill also
has one other issue to it. This would allow APRNs and physicians assistance to issue the
handicap placards for those people to the Department of Revenue for them to sign off on that
for those who are eligible to have a handicap placard. Mr. Speaker, that's pretty well
what it does and I think this would do honor to all of those able-bodied men and women
across this state that serve as the nurses and the advanced practice registered nurses
across this state.
I'll be glad to stand for questions and if not, I don't know if you have one question.
You care to yield?
I will yield for one question.
Chair recognizes representative Maynard to your right for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Chairman Powell is not sure that physical therapists get a doctorate degree and they
too should be allowed to give persons with disabilities and a handicapped ticket.
Well, I don't have an opinion on that, but if the latest state so, then it'd be the will
of the body in here, and God knows what to send it to do.
Mr. Speaker, I would certainly not sure he knows what they'll do either.
Mr. Speaker, I would certainly appreciate your favorable consideration,
show honor to those men and women who practice medicine as APR-Ns,
and I'll be certain to yield the will.
Chair, have another member that wish to be heard.
Chair recognizes Chairman Nicks to speak to the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I'll be very brief.
I can't pass up an opportunity to share some love
with our nurses as you know my daughter
is a nurse practitioner.
And I wanted to just point out the people
we're talking about here.
We're talking about, when we talk about
the advanced practice registered nurses,
we're talking about certified nurse midwives,
Certified Nurse Specialist in Psychiatric and Mental Health,
Certified Registered Nurse Anethasist.
These are highly trained and well-qualified people.
One thing to think about quite often,
the first person that sees someone who's
coming into the health care system as a nurse,
we need these good people there.
They're a critical component of our health care system.
They work in a team, as was mentioned earlier, with the doctors.
I don't know that they keep them from killing people,
but they are part of that critical team.
Dr. Newton and I have talked about that a number of times.
And they feel that need that we need.
They can be there when the doctor's not there.
And I just wanted to come and say I support that.
And any way that we can encourage and give positive
recognition to these very dedicated professionals,
I really want to do it.
They carry a lot of load in that health care system, and I hope that we will continue
to give them the professional recognition that they deserve.
And Mr. Speaker, with that I'll yield the well, thank you.
Gentlemen, as yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being
ordered?
The chair here is not in the previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute?
The chair here is none.
The committee substitute is adopted.
