TRANSCRIPT
----------
All right. Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Senator Nikki Marrett. I represent the
ninth districts for those of you that don't know me, but I think everybody is pretty familiar
with district I represent is in Guinnat County, and I live in Grayson. But I am so proud to stand
here today with our organizers, our future leaders, and all of our organizers and advocacy groups.
as we have officially introduced my signature bill package
for the 2025 session, and it is the family and workforce
justice agenda.
It includes legislation that will address threats
to our civil rights brought to us by technologies,
protect us in so many areas in our lives,
and ensure that we can continue to see affordable
and high quality housing options available for everyone.
We start with SB 92, which is the red flag law designed to keep guns away from people who are a threat to themselves and others.
Through an innovative judicial order system, we will be able to temporarily require that people deemed to be a threat,
temporarily surrender any firearms or ammunition in their possession.
The bill is currently assigned to the Judiciary Committee,
and I've been working diligently with gun safety
and victim advocacy groups to see that SB 92 receives a hearing.
No gun safety bills have received a hearing so far
in the 25 days that we have been in session.
This is unacceptable, and I call on my Republican colleagues
to join me in passing this common sense solution
that will protect our children.
Victims are domestic violence, and so many more beyond that.
SB 164 is a groundbreaking bill
that has received coverage in the Washington Post.
It bans surveillance, base pricing, and wage discrimination.
Corporations collect data about all of us
and are using this data to uneven the playing field.
They know exactly how much the charge us
for the same goods and different services
that are charging other people for different amounts.
They maximize their profits by determining
who they can systemically pay less.
Systems like this are only as good as the data
that is fed into them.
The reality is that all economic data is,
all economic data in Georgia is reflective
of the centuries of race and gender-based discrimination
that has existed in every sector of our economy.
When corporations target people
who are in dire economic circumstances
and pay them less, because they know the worker will take less.
More often than not, the worker will be a person of color.
Will be a woman, or will be a disabled person.
SB 165 is a bill that will protect our youngest children
from their emerging threat and exploitation
presented by Social Media Act.
That's my next bill, SB 165.
The company's professed off creating addictions
that alter the brain development of our children.
And it's time that we hold these companies accountable
for keeping minors off of their apps.
This is another simple solution
where I'm calling for bipartisan support.
We have received coverage across many outlets,
state-wide and I have heard resounding cries from parents across the state that want this
legislation to be heard. The next bill is SB 166. It is my solution to whole corporate
landlords accountable for providing high-quality housing in our state. It closes a loophole
where county governments have a much larger time enforcing health and safety codes and
violations in our unincorporated areas.
That is areas that are not within the city limits.
And it's about 75% of a Gwinnett County.
It's time to hold landlords of chronically dangerous
and uncared properties accountable,
which will protect our renters across the state.
The next bill is SB 167, which is the fifth Democratic
responsible bill to be heard in committee on Wednesday, and just a note, not many of our democratic bills have been heard as of today, or have moved through the rules to be considered for a vote.
This bill takes a basic legal principle that you cannot discriminate against people on the basis that they race, sex, religion, or disability status.
And it extends the concept to AI decision-making systems and algorithms.
This is something we have received positive feedback about,
and we've got positive feedback about it in committee,
and we're going to continue working on it.
People have no idea how many major decisions
about their lives are being made by AI systems,
loan approvals, job applications,
employee management decisions, health care,
and legal access, and even more.
We need to hold these companies accountable
The design and deploy of AI programs responsible to ensure that their systems are properly
tested to avoid bias.
And we need to know when these systems are being used to make decisions that are impacting
our livelihood.
With SB 167, Georgia has the opportunity to be among the first in the country to address
discrimination driven by AI systems and algorithms.
It's time to be bold.
It's time to be proactive when it comes to addressing our current future challenges.
Our ability to access good jobs, affordable housing, and to feel safe in public area.
It's all upon us to do that.
And lastly, we have one more bill.
We're about to submit today into the hopper.
I have a few signatures.
This bill will ban algorithmic, rent fixing, sorry, that was a hard word to say, which
is when corporate landlords use software to collude and gouge our rental market for
maximum gain. The cost of housing is out of control in Georgia and this is my solution
to address the rental side of our housing market. This is often neglected when the conversation
revolves around the cost of purchasing homes. The family and workforce justice agenda
that does not end with signing die this year.
Whichever of these bills does not receive a hearing this year,
we will continue to advocate for these policies
in our bills next year,
because this change is desperately needed.
It's time for the Senate to take real action
to help people in Georgia, not insurance companies,
and it's time to make housing affordable,
ensure our rights are protected in the digital age.
I call on my colleagues to join me in fighting
for this legislation, all of these pieces of legislation.
These solutions are not about red or blue.
These are solutions that are about protecting everyone.
I want to thank you all for coming today
to learn more about this legislation.
And with that, I will take questions.
Question.
OK.
All right.
Great.
No questions.
Thank you all for joining me today.
And thank you for listening.
Thank you very much.
