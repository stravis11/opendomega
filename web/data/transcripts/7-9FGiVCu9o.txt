TRANSCRIPT
----------
We will get started, we do have a quorum, and Senator Eccles, would you do the invocation
for us?
Day number 12, is that it?
Let us pray.
Dear Heavenly Father, thank you for today, Lord.
Thank you for allowing us to be here to do the work of the people of Georgia.
I pray that you'll give us clear minds as we make decisions and let us do what is
best for Georgia. Your name I pray. Amen. We're going to have a presentation. I may let Senator
Hawkins go ahead here. I was the presentation was going to be first, but I'm thinking you might
be quick just because we voted on this pretty much before. So if you want to come on up to the mic.
All right. How are you today, Mr. Chairman?
Either one you want. We'll turn it down.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And let me start first and say we heard from Senator Eccles, a similar bill.
I think yours has one change to it.
Yes, it passed down.
I think there may be a couple of new votes.
So it may not be an animal's vote, but probably be somewhere lines again
So tell us maybe the difference between what she had and what you think that she had the
0.75 still in there
Yeah, and the 0.75 was taken out by advisement at eccg
And that 0.75 you're referring to for the committee members is that if the county goes it alone without the cities
right that's exactly right because house bill 946 is a house bill we're
talking about LC number 500730S right now it teasplots is only splice that
requires a 100% dissipation so we have had counties in this state loser
teasplots because one city or one municipality decided not to sign the IGA
We had to, the last time that we tried doing a T-Splots,
one was Resthaven of 45 people.
The other one is Buford, it comes into part of Hall County.
And so the 7.5 that Senator Eccles,
I was referring to, was what you would,
what the T-Splots would be based on,
if it was not a unanimous vote.
Hall County decided not to do that
because of all the computations,
in all the other situations that would arise with that.
This bill cleans that up.
So as long as you have over 50% of the municipality
population, municipalities in favor of the teach blocks,
then the teach blocks will be put on a referendum
for the people to vote for.
And that's it.
This bill has been agreed to by GMA,
ACCG and the Chamber of Commerce.
Everybody's gonna thumbs up on this bill.
Okay, any questions of the sponsor of the bill?
We've got a couple of people signed up to speak,
including I think maybe the administrator of Hall County,
but I don't know if that's necessary.
Really, it's up to the committee.
Everyone okay to go ahead and vote
with any further tests.
We've seen this same bill with one change taking out the option of counties going it alone
Okay, is that sender teller? Thank you mr. Chairman. I think it's important to point out
Chairman Hawkins that if there is not unanimity doesn't this bill drop it down
It's not a 10-year referendum or a 10-year tax is a six-year tax
Correct and thank you for saying that yeah, yeah, we've heard from counties
around the state that is an extra year allows them a little more time to get
things up and going. So yes, thank you. That's a good point.
No other questions is the committee. I mean, out here a motion now if we feel like we're ready.
We've got a motion from Senator Eccles, their second. Second from Senator
Ramontarte, any other discussion?
All those in favor of the motion, raise your hand.
OK, and all opposed.
Senator Ork, did you vote either way or?
OK, so your bill passes.
And who's your sponsor over here?
Senator Eccles.
Oh, good choice.
I think so.
Sort of cute too, isn't she?
Yeah.
All right, we've got Kyle Wingfield here
with a presentation for the committee.
If you want to come up,
there was a lot of work done over the off session.
We haven't, no.
Okay, so the floor is yours. I'll tell the committee. Part of this was Rhea Headerman
who's been working a lot of states, worked with us some over the off session in our committees
that some of the people here were part of the tax credit study committees, and I think
I've got it right.
You're going to start on page 14 and go through all the derivatives there in the presentation
and break down for everybody that didn't have calculus three, how those formulas work.
But I think we'll just do an after-class tutoring session on that, and y'all can tell me how
those things work.
But yes, no, thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of this committee.
I'm sorry.
Somebody said I didn't introduce you properly.
Kyle Wingfield, introduce your sub name and address for the record, if you would.
Yes.
Kyle Wingfield on the President's CEO of the Georgia Public Policy Foundation and Georgia
Policy Impact, and we, as you know, are a think tank based here in Atlanta.
we work on state public policy issues.
And as the chairman alluded, we participated
in the tax credit study committee this summer
and brought down our, or rather had via Zoom,
our colleague from Ohio Ray Hederman
from the Buck Eyre Institute, our sister,
think tank and Ohio, which has a center
that does economic modeling.
And so after the discussion that Ray had with the study committee,
So we took some things that we'd heard that were of interest to people and commissioned
this modeling study that Buck I put together for us in which we published a couple of weeks
ago.
So I'll go through that in a moment, but I wanted to start with just kind of some kind
of opening thoughts in terms of how we approached this and how we approached tax policy generally.
As many of you know, Georgia is a low tax state.
You can see that by virtually every metric that is out there.
However, we compete in a very highly competitive region when it comes to taxes.
So we're sandwiched between two zero income tax states in Tennessee and Florida.
To our northeast, we have North Carolina, which 10 years ago had a higher income tax rate
than Georgia does.
through some steady reductions of that rate,
it is now come to have a lower rate than we do.
And that's both on the personal side and the corporate side.
So, and then we compete with states like Texas, of course,
which are not neighbors of ours,
but, you know, and we compete nationally, obviously,
for workers, for talent, for companies,
for investment, that sort of thing.
So it's important to note that just because we're doing
well from a tax rate standpoint doesn't mean we've done all the work that there is to do
because we know state is sitting idly by and that's particularly true over the last few years
as states have seen lots of revenue come in and they're trying to figure out okay how do we
adjust and we've seen lots of states adjust by cutting those rates. Now how the state raises
this revenue is also matters just the fact that we're a low tax state is not the only important fact
There's good bit of agreement among economists that different taxes have different effects
on the economy.
Some of them are more harmful to the economy than others.
So income taxes versus sales taxes, for instance.
So it's important to look at the structure of the code in addition to how much money it
raises.
And then the final point that we come to the table with is that generally speaking, the
private sector spends money more productively
than the public sector.
Now that doesn't mean that the public sector
doesn't do important things if that were the case.
Chairman Tillery could come in and put zeros in the budget
and y'all could go home after a couple of days.
Obviously the state funds some very important functions
and must continue to do so.
But when it comes down to a decision
of do we do a little bit more here?
Do we do a little bit more there?
from an economic standpoint, from growing the economy,
you want to err on the side of giving that dollar back
to the private sector rather than finding another way
to spend it here in the public sector.
So with all that said, those are the outline here.
And we had the four scenarios modeled.
So I believe you have these in front of you.
If you turn to page six, scenario one was accelerating
the tax cuts that this body passed in 2022, House Bill 1437, and extending them.
So if you look at this table number one, the top part of each of these tables represents
the baseline. That's tax according to current statute in terms of the rate. These are projections
of state GDP, the number of jobs in the state, tax revenues, consumption, and investment.
And then the bottom part of each table represents what would happen according to the models
if changes were implemented.
So in the bottom part of this table, one on page six, you can see that the tax rate
goes down about twice as fast at this, under this scenario, and ends up going a percentage
point farther, so going overall about twice as far as current law holds.
And what you see there is that you get a big boost in state GDP.
You see about by the end of this, you would see about 16,000 more jobs, more investment,
consumption and ending at a tax rate of 3.99. The second scenario was we asked it's employment.
Oh, so it's four column. So there's two, five, seven, nine, eleven, four, two, six,
That would be, so when you got to, on the first line, 2024, if you were at a 5.19% tax rate,
you would expect to have 2,000 more jobs than the baseline number in the top part of the table.
Those are the sales.
Those are, yes.
These are all in, in thousand.
Okay, thank you.
Well, those numbers are in thousand.
Some of the others are larger.
Page six.
Page 6.
Page 5 describes the scenario and page 6 has the table.
It looks like this.
So we're on five on our sheet.
Oh, I see.
OK.
OK, it's number 6 on mine.
Yes, yes, scenario one, table one, then scenario two, table two looks at, instead of lowering
the personal income tax, it actually looks at eliminating the corporate income tax over
a period of five years.
And so you can see the same baseline top of the table, and this is table two, and then
the projections from the model on the bottom of the table.
What I draw your attention to here is,
if you look at the last number in both table one and table two,
and they're next to each other on mine,
it looks like they may be on opposite pieces of paper
for y'all, so it's a little bit harder to do.
When you get to the end here,
you've cut twice as much tax revenue on the personal side,
But the growth to GDP is actually greater on the corporate side, and that's because of the much higher level of investment that you get.
And so what I would tell you that kind of take away from that is when you're looking at the most bang for your buck,
when cutting taxes, you're going to get a larger economic response from cutting on the corporate side than on the personal side.
And in fact, there's a couple of lines here where you can see where they line up exactly
on the tax revenue side.
Table three, and I'm trying to go through this quickly because I know you'll have questions.
Let's go back to table one there.
I think people may still be confused on this a little bit from I'm sensing that in the
room I guess.
But let's go on our page five there.
The tax revenue is at $33 million now.
You're saying at $20, 30, if the tax rate was 4.99%, we would be bringing in $38.8 billion.
You would have growth that would be increasing taxes.
You would be cutting the tax rate, it would be decreasing taxes.
And then the chart at the bottom is, I guess, going down from 5.19 to 3.99, how much tax
revenue is lost from the price line by doing that?
Yes.
So when you get to the bottom of that table at 3.99, the tax revenue shows a minus 4.9
billion.
So that's how much you would subtract from that 38.8.
And that's how you, what you would have at that point.
And one of the things, I guess, the calculations try to figure out, I try to put it in non-calculus
terms or something, if you were at a zero percent tax rate, you would bring in the zero dollars.
If you were at a hundred percent tax rate, you might also bring in zero dollars, because
who's going to work if the government takes a hundred percent of it?
And so we in between, it's a little bit fluid, and you try to derive economic activity
versus taxes where you're going to be at and I think that's obviously we can't get
it to the calculations the economist used back on page 14 and on but that's sort of where
we're at on that so your tax revenue in 2030 where you're going down you're 3.99% and
the tax revenue you've lost what are the assumptions in that that you haven't made any changes
and your budget are.
So this is just looking at the revenue side.
That's right.
So it's not trying to project versus spending
or anything like that.
It's just telling you how much revenue
would be projected to come in.
I will point out, these are inflation-adjusted numbers.
So these are all, so you would see these numbers
plus some measure of inflation.
They're kept constant to try to make comparisons.
That's a good point that inflation's
been taken out of these numbers.
And the way that, just if I could very simply explain
how the model works, you're familiar with a lot
of economic models where they use a multiplier
to try to say, well, if you increase this spending,
then that's going to go, then someone's going to spend
that dollar and so on.
And so it really matters what multiplier you use.
This model doesn't do that.
What this model does is it tries to take the empirical data
based on when similar changes have been made in the past.
What was the response?
In other words, when a state cut taxes by this amount,
how many jobs were created above what was expected?
So it's not trying to calculate how many times
money's gonna move through the economy.
It's trying to say, okay, based on what we've seen
in the past, this is what we would expect to happen
if this were done.
That's the way this particular model works.
All right, Roger.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
great to see you, appreciate all the great work you've
written forward to us.
So, in looking at your chart, you know, going down to
the 3.99 percent tax rate, so it's an offsetable
co-op for round numbers, $5 billion, a budget impact.
As other states have done this, obviously they've had
to find either some type of offset either they're
growing fast enough, they could absorb those, or they
add attacks as in other areas, such as Mark of
Facilitator, things that nature to make sure we're
even with main street. Has anybody been doing what we're doing is looking at those tax credits
that some are not providing return on investment and could easily fill some of this gap in?
I believe there are some states that are looking at that. I couldn't give you a state-by-state breakdown,
but I'd be happy to do kind of a round up and get that back to you later. One thing that we've
seen the state of Iowa attempt to do is set aside some money in what they call a taxpayer relief fund.
and the idea would be you're going to have to match your budget, you're spending to your revenues,
but while times are good and you've brought in more revenues, you could set some of that aside,
and then if revenues come in short of what you've projected,
you've got some money to pull out of reserve and dedicate toward that and make the budget whole
to kind of smooth the transition as you're doing that.
So that would be outside of a traditional rainy day fund then?
Yes.
Okay.
And then I know you've helped us and looked at some of the measurements that we've done over
over the last few years, especially, and certainly some have come back positive, but a great
many have come back with an upside down ROI and could be a great way to help all Georgians.
Very well could be.
Well, North Carolina is an example.
You mentioned them that have gone down to $3.99 and are trying to get it lower.
They quit matching the federal R&D tax credit as an example.
Our film tax credit that I think is at $1.4 billion, that would be what, $1,400 million.
They made a cap of don't anybody fall on the floor out there 31 million was their cap
up in North Carolina on that tax credit because their theory was if we reduce everybody's
taxes we actually get more growth and you know then pick in the winners and lose your
center or I'll give her next.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Pat.
On your introductory remarks in the second paragraph includes a sentence that says Georgia
It looks unlikely to continue to attract or retain relocating workers without more
competitive tax reforms.
How do you support that given our meteoric growth in job creation and attracting incredibly
important manufacturing and particularly in the EV space and in the battery space?
How do you support that sentence that you assert there that we look unlikely to continue to attract or retain relocating workers?
Well, the differentiation there between what we're talking about, you're talking about job creation, which is the company creating jobs.
What this is talking about is the workers to fill those jobs.
And I know that that's been a very important topic during this session.
recognize that we are growing jobs at a rate that's faster than we're growing
workers who are prepared to fill those jobs. We've got to bring people in to
fill those. And if you're if you're someone who is thinking about moving to
another state, one of the big factors you're going to take into account is what
is the return of my own work? What is that what rate will I be taxed if I go to
Georgia versus another state and so that that would be the thinking behind that
sentences that we're not talking about the employers we're talking about the
employees to fill those jobs because as you say the state has has had a very
great record in recent years in particular in attracting companies but we
need people to fill the jobs that they're creating and the people to fill the
jobs are what this is talking and you think people stay away from here because
our tax rate is too high. I don't know that there is that the underlying
assumption. I think the assumption would be they're not moving here in the
numbers. They could be moving if we made it more attractive to them on this
front. Now obviously people have lots of different factors. They take into
account. But this is a big one. I just think that's hard to support.
Thank you. Thank you, sir. I'm still having trouble with the chart. I'm
I should have in trouble and I'm not being too thickheaded on it, but I'm still having
another trouble with not enough zeros on the numbers or what the what the titles mean
with you.
And I know we've got time as an issue here too and we probably need to study and then
come back.
But just on the personal income tax, I mean, kind of walk down and tell what I know what
gross domestic product means and employment means and tax rate.
I don't know what consumption means.
I don't know what investment means and then come on down through the holes.
So consumption is, so you've got the tax rate, you've got the tax rate, and then the
year that it supplied to, just got it left to right.
You've got the state GDP in the next columns.
That's how large the state's economy is.
Then you've got employment, how many people are employed, that's in thousands.
These other numbers are generally in millions.
Then you've got tax revenue, how much is coming in.
And then you've got consumption, consumer spending,
how much are consumers in the economy spending,
and then investment.
How much is being invested, whether it's
into a new business or into expanding a business,
or that sort of thing?
So how many zeros have to go in those numbers?
That's what I'm.
And so if you look at the tax revenue number,
you're going to add six zeros there.
Six zeros?
Yes. Okay. That's probably why I'm struggling with it.
Okay. On three zeroes on the employment census.
Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it.
It wouldn't have fit on the page if we included all the zeroes, unfortunately.
Yeah. Well, it looks like we did something anyway. Okay.
Okay. And we're going to get shortened on for the same year.
I'll send her. I'll just go ahead. I'll read it.
Mr. Wingfield, thank you for bringing this. Some.
The proper way to evaluate the four scenarios.
areas to try to chart a path forward, the best path forward.
How do you do that?
I mean, can you just look at each one and take, you got an increase, you got a fall-off
in tax revenues, but you've got an increase in GDP, increase in consumption, increase
in investment.
Would you add those and those three and compare against the tax revenue drop, or I mean,
How do you wisely go about looking at these four scenarios and say, we need to do one or
two or three or four, we need to do a mix or, I mean, I read your conclusion it basically
just said keep the tax rate under four percent.
So I think the way that I would answer that is to say it really depends on what the
priorities of the General Assembly are.
Are you trying to grow the state's economy as fast as you can?
Are you trying to attract workers, you know, to the earlier conversation we were having?
You're growing jobs, but are you attracting people to fill those jobs?
I think you have to decide what your policy priority, what your goal priority is, and
then these scenarios help tell you, okay, if that's your priority, then you want to look
at something along these lines.
And the scenarios really are meant to look rather different so that you can have a diverse
menu of options here.
It's not so much to say you should cut this tax rate by this amount in this year, so much
as directionally, if you go in this direction, you're going to boost the economy the most.
You're going to get the most bang for your buck that way.
And so on through the other priorities that you can set.
All right, Senator Estabés.
Thank you so much, takeoff.
Really quick, do these calculations, particularly on the consumption and investment side, take
into account, similar to what vice-trailers was talking about, you make up the money somewhere,
so whether it's fees, whether it's increase in sales tax, whether it's increase in property
taxes, take into account the fact that consumption may be impacted by what's happening in other
areas?
Now, this simply looks at the results of making this policy change.
If you made other policy changes to accommodate that, then there would be other effects from
that, right?
We didn't model, for instance, like trying to do a overall revenue neutral while cutting
the income tax by this amount.
You would have the effects of, well, the government's going to spend less or we're going to
raise sales to whatever, as you mentioned, there's a lot of different options you could
have at that point.
This simply looks at this particular policy change, and then you would have to look at,
okay, if we wanted to achieve this goal, then we would either need to reduce spending
by that amount or we'd need to offset somewhere else, that kind of thing.
I would point out, since we've had some talk about tax credits, table four in scenario
four, we asked them to look at, well, what if you cut tax expenditures across the board
by 500 million, and that would be tax deductions, exemptions, credits.
That's what we mean when we say tax expenditures.
And then lowered personal income taxes by the same 500 million.
What would be the effect?
And you'll see a lot of zeros here.
And so what that tells us is the model says, one, it can't quite go finally enough to any
particular change, and this doesn't really specify which credits we're talking about.
way, but the most important takeaway from that is what matters from an economic standpoint
is how much is coming out of the economy to be spent by the government rather than staying
in the economy to be spent by private actors.
So that's really the main takeaway from that table four and that sort of highlights it
that a revenue neutral change doesn't necessarily give you the economic growth where you get
the growth is by putting keeping more money in the hands of your of your
private sector rather than spending it as a state government.
All right, and I think Senator Tilbury had a question.
He's been waiting for a speech.
I don't really have a question as much as I have a comment and I want to tell you,
I want to cut income tax as much as I can and or much as we can.
That being said, I will tell you, my son lived in Tennessee for three years.
He said it was very expensive to live there. He's moved back to Georgia,
and he's so happy to be back in Georgia and he is paying income tax,
but he's saving a lot more money. So I think you, you know, we got to look at the whole picture.
So I just want to caution everybody that, you know, some of these states that don't have income
tax, they get you in other ways, and he noticed it. And now he notices it. Now he bought a
house series back he's married and he loves being here and he's saving a lot more money
living in Georgia.
Yeah, and I think Georgia has, you know, you've got obviously the Kansas model where they
cut and hope the revenue would come.
You've got North Carolina that's been a measure approach over the last 10 years and we've
been even much more cautious than them, I think.
And we certainly don't want to go out there and do anything beyond that.
Is that Senator Red that's got a question?
We're gonna go ahead.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Kyle.
You know my position on income tax.
I think Georgia's still 47, 48, 49 in per capita spending.
My question is on all these models,
did any of them show a reduction in income tax
that did not result in an employment growth?
So I think if you're running,
I mean, even when they run the trackers for the hurricanes,
there's always this wild one that never comes here and goes to Vermuda, is there was there any that didn't show
job growth or consumption growth or investment growth at some point? These are the only four we ran.
So we didn't run 20 and pick forward to show you. We designed
four and said let's see what they say. So you might
create one that would come up with something like that. I guess
tagging on that, do you know my instrument? Do other states that have tried this, have
they seen, have you seen a state or no of a state that you can give us a point to that
they made one of these changes and did not see either the increase in state GDP, jobs
or consumption? The chairman mentioned Kansas and I think that's kind of the cautionary
detail that where the idea was we're going to cut taxes and we're not going to do anything
else to match that and we're going to count on growth to make up the difference.
And that has proven not to work.
So you're going to have to offset the changes either by making cuts to the budget that you're
willing to live with or by raising revenues elsewhere that you're willing to live with.
I guess the disastrous scenario would be we're just going to make this one change and we're
not going to account for it anywhere else.
And growth makes up for a portion of the revenue loss, but only a portion.
It's not going to make up the entirety of it or even the majority of it in the short
time.
And that might have big gut too.
Senator Rhett.
Oh, I was just going to say that we need to make sure we move with caution because I
I remember when I took economics 101,
they would always emphasize that this is a model or vacuum.
In the real world, anything can happen
like a tsunami or a pandemic, military mobilization.
I know you want to get to a certain rate,
but I just wanted to state that we should exercise,
caution us to how fast we move.
And I think we have been cautious
and we also have real world examples of other states
that we can model after and say they did this,
don't do that.
The state's got a $68 billion deficit,
whatever they did, don't do that.
The state cut their taxes below us,
maybe we want to look at what they did.
So yeah, we've got to be conscious
and we've got to do it the right way.
Any other, I saw there was a lot on over here
and then it went off, go ahead.
I was, this is kind of maybe even somewhat,
not trying to, but contradict what Senator Rhett said.
The House sent us a bill a couple of years ago to immediately go to 4.99 percent.
And had we done that, we would have had the revenue.
And we would have had the revenue last year, we would have had the revenue this year.
So I don't, I guess my question for you is how do you juxtapose that with Kansas, right?
So we, the Senate put the throttle on there to phase it in over eight years or whatever
we've done.
At least in the years we've had so far we know that it has not been necessary.
So do you have to overlay that with migration patterns because obviously the growth of
the state here is very different from Kansas and would that not give a different result
because how we go on to even 4.5% when the House sent us the bill that went to 4.9 that
we would have had the revenue and still had a surplus?
Certainly the economic conditions were entirely different when Kansas made its change versus
the last couple of years that we've seen here in Georgia.
So you do have to take account of those things.
I think what I would describe to kind of get it at the two comments here, I think what
I would describe these scenarios is more aggressive than current policy but not recklessly so.
So going faster because we've seen revenue continue to remain strong, even as it's been
slowing down, it's not really falling off a cliff at this point.
We're not reverting back to the preinflationary numbers from a revenue standpoint.
So this really is, we've talked about an accelerator for the tax cuts that were passed two years
ago.
This is a faster accelerator, you might say, than that.
But without going, jumping directly to 399 or something like that in one fell swoop.
Follow up to that.
Since we did not go to the 499, we were put in a position of refunds as opposed to a lower
rate.
If you all looked at or even not, I know you haven't here, but at a macro level, the
value of these kind of responding to surplus is with refunds versus a lower rate across
the board.
Does that, would that impact these employment numbers at all due to predictability?
We didn't model that, but I would say generally, I think it's fair to say that it is better
from an economic standpoint to set rates and lower rates and give businesses and employees
something to expect coming down the road rather than to hand them back some of their
money in a rebate. It should, it's going to drive investment which is going to help smooth
some of the inflation that you might see from some of that rather than just giving people,
if you think about a rebate is giving people back more money for what they already did,
lowering rates in the future is incentivizing them to do more, to work more, to save more,
to invest more, and that's what grows the economy.
So we, I think generally speaking, it's safe to say that it's preferable to provide
tax relief through rate cuts rather than a rebate.
And I guess I would add to that, we're not talking about cutting services.
I always like pouring on our teachers and the state of Georgia have the highest average
by anywhere in the South and Texas, Virginia.
That's another argument we're saying.
What will be the right that will get us growth
in the state and create jobs.
Services aren't really a part of this discussion.
How much longer have you got on your presentation?
There might be another question or two.
I think I've made most of the points I wanted to make.
So I know that the committee has a lot of work to do today.
I'm happy to stick around until after the hearing, though,
and speak with anyone who wants to be able to speak.
Senator, one more question here.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Earlier in your remarks, I believe you said something to the effect that this approach,
this analysis did not include the multiplier effects of money spent by government in the
economy.
And I'm not sure why you would leave that out.
That's number one.
And then number two, what do we make of the fact that during the pandemic, when the federal
government made major infusions of money to the states and into the economy. And we flourished
in that setting with this infusion of federal investment. And we pulled back from a real
negative projection that we had expected as a result of going into this pandemic. And in
In fact, we flourished, our economy flourished, it grew and helped contribute to this big surplus
that we have.
So how do you account, for one, why would you not look at the multiplier effect?
It's the basic part of the picture, and two, we had the real-life demonstration of
the infusion of public funds into the economy and so significant, healthy growth.
So to answer your first question, the reason, as I understand it, that our colleagues at
the book I institute don't use the multiplier approach is because you've got to pick what
number you use as the multiplier.
And the one thing that I think you can be certain of is whatever number you pick is not
going to be the right number.
You might be close to the right number.
You might be far from the right number, but you're just sort of picking a number and
saying, well, we think this is what it's going to be.
What they've done instead is look at the record, the historical record and say, all right,
when states have changed their tax policy, what happened?
And they've pulled all that into the model.
So in a way, it is acknowledging that money is going to move and that there's going
to be growth.
But instead of picking a number and trying to base everything on that, it's taking the
totality of the changes that have been seen across a lot of different changes.
So empirical data rather than a forecast, I guess, is the way that I would try to describe
it as the difference in approach.
But you're not doing a multiplier on anything argue the the private money or if I understand all those Greek
Letters and formulas at the back correctly that that's right
That's right, okay, and then for the second thing at the the sheer volume of money that was put into the economy was bound to have an effect
What we're arguing here is that the greater effect and the more efficient way to grow the economy is
is to reward people for working,
saving and investing more,
rather than handing them more money regardless.
So I got the check, you know,
the pandemic relief check.
I didn't work anymore to do that.
I didn't produce anymore.
I tried to go ahead and spend it to get into the economy
because I understood that was the effect
or the intended use of that money.
But it didn't change my behavior
in the sense of what the fundamentals of the economy
need to grow, which are work savings and investing.
So that would be the distinction we would draw.
You can put more money into the economy,
and something's going to happen.
But we believe the more efficient and effective use
of that money is to give people an incentive
to do the things that you would like them to do,
the things that are the building blocks of the economy.
And the money was put into the economy
by the federal government in a very bipartisan manner.
No doubt.
And it did cause growth no doubt.
The downside of that is because of the deficits,
we were spending about 300 billion on interest.
Now our interest rates have climbed over $1 billion
on a $4 trillion budget.
So if we, as a state, were saying,
over 25% of our budgets kind of go to interest,
we'd be in big trouble around here.
And that continuing interest, which
looks like it's going to climb, that's the problem with that.
Yeah, if we max out our credit cards in a year,
we can have a really good year.
And then we've got to pay them off the next year,
we're in trouble.
The federal government kind of did that.
And they probably needed to do some of it
to keep the economy going.
But there was a big downside as well for what they did.
Senator Audius, I guess you can have a last word here.
Thank you.
Kyle, wouldn't you say that you really did use a multiplier
rather than project in one, you used what actually happened
when states took these actions.
So money did move around.
And there was a multiplier.
And this is actually the actual effect of what
happened, as opposed to picking one out of the air
and put it in, right?
You can think about it similarly.
I'm trying to avoid the word multiplier,
because I think there's kind of a technical use
of that term or, and that's not what was done.
But yes, it's acknowledging that when you incentivize people
to work more, they're going to work more,
and that's going to put more money into the economy.
When you incentivize them to save more and invest more,
they're going to do those things,
and that's going to build the economy.
So you can think about it that way.
I'm just trying to keep my technical jargon
as clean as I can.
All right, we certainly appreciate your presentation.
Obviously, had a lot of initiative, the committee.
And if you'll get offline and go through the derivatives
starting on page 14 with everybody,
afterwards, make sure everybody's good on all of it.
Meet me here at 10 o'clock tonight,
and we'll go through all that.
So thank you for your time today.
All right, is Representative Perkel here?
Did he make it in?
I know he was tied up in another committee.
I tried to fill a buster to get him here,
but I don't think I did.
So I guess we'll catch that on the Wednesday meeting
and we'll be adjourned.
It's right now, it's four o'clock
unless I get an earlier meeting.
Can you get me an earlier meeting?
They will all accept committee meetings and corporations, it's hard for me to even keep
my public safety community.
Yeah.
They try to cancel me.
Guys, we're really near the meeting.
Yeah.
I mean.
So.
I'm interested in getting more information.
Here's the.
