As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading in prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the eighth House District, representing Stan Gutherr. Chairman Gutherr. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It is my pleasure and honor to introduce to you today Ricky Powell. And before I start talking about him, I want to also recognize his wife, Donna, and son Caleb, who are seated over here and welcome them to the house. Ricky serves as the senior pastor of First Baptist Church of Blaresville, Georgia. A role he assumed in August of 2022. Hailing from Georgia, he grew up in Lake Park, graduated from Lounge High School, and served churches, equipment, and Valdosta, Georgia. Prior to moving to Blaresville, he devoted 28 years to the Fort Carolina Baptist Church in Jacksonville, Florida. He's a flat lander that moved to the mountains. Ricky earned his master of divinity in Christian apologetics from the New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary, and he's known for his unwavering commitment. Ricky is not just a faithful pastor, but also a dedicated preacher of God's Word. Please welcome Pastor Ricky Powell. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Good morning. Thank you, Speaker Barnes, and Representative Gunter, and each one of you. It is an honor to be with you for this sacred moment today. As my friend mentioned, I grew up in Lake Park, Georgia. As a little boy, my Sunday school teacher at Corinth Baptist Church in Lake Park asked us what we wanted to be when we grew up. And I remember saying with boldness, I'm going to become a Georgia State Patrol officer. And she said, why? And I said, I want to wear that uniform. I want to have a big gun. I want to drive a cool car. I'll be able to turn the light zone, turn the sirens on, drive as fast as I want, and if somebody messes with me, I can arrest him. Well, as you can see, God had a different plan for my life. God probably said to the angels of heaven that boy won't be able to arrest anybody without a lot of backup. So he called me into the gospel ministry when I was 17 years old. And as I look back on my childhood ambition, I realize now that many women go into law enforcement, not for the perks and privileges, but in order to serve and to protect. But honestly, at the age of 12, all I could think about and all I could see were the perks, the privileges, the power, the prestige of being a State Patrol officer. I'm sure you can overlook my childish ambition of seeking to be served rather than to serve. But what's harder to overlook is the tendency of the human heart even after we grow up to seek to be served first rather than to serve. A spouse might expect to be served without reciprocation, an employer might take advantage of an employee just for personal gain. A pastor might use people to build his ministry rather than using his ministry to build God's people. An elected official might use his office for personal gain rather than for the public's best interest. And you know, we're not the first to struggle with this misguided ambition for greatness and for service. Would it surprise you to know that even the first disciples of Jesus argued among themselves who would be greatest in their company? Who would be at the right and the left hand of Jesus in the kingdom of God when it came? Their arguments became so heated that Jesus had to stop dead in his tracks on his way to Jerusalem where he was destined to die for our sin on the cross and deal with his men. In the Gospel of Mark 10, verses 42 and following, the Bible says, and Jesus called them to him and said, You know that those who are considered rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them and their great ones exercise authority over them, but it shall not be so among you. Would whoever would be great among you must be your servant. And whoever would be first among you must be slave of all. I love that Jesus does not so much rebuke their ambition as he redefines it and he redirects it. Jesus says, So you want to be great? Great. Serve someone else. You want to be first? Good. Get at the back of the line and be a slave to the needs of other people. Jesus says, In my kingdom, I don't measure greatness by how many people serve you. I measure greatness by how many people you serve. Now perhaps you're thinking Pastor Ricky, this sounds great. Probably works really well on a Sunday morning or in a pastor's life. But we live in the real world and the principles of Jesus being a servant of all and a slave of all is not going to work in the real world. Somebody has to take the lead. Somebody has to take charge. And listen, I get it. Come to the foreway stop right down the road from my church and try to practice Jesus' principle of putting others ahead of yourself. Say, No, no, you go. No, you go. No, you go. It won't be long before the guy behind you tells you where you can go. Jesus is not saying that it's wrong to take leadership. He's not saying it's wrong to have ambition. What he is saying is whenever you are in a position of authority or power or opportunity or responsibility, leverage your life for the good of someone else's life. In fact, here's a good question that perhaps we can learn to ask ourselves, How can I help you? It's a simple question, but it's a profound question. Maybe you walk across the aisle and ask, How can I help you? Maybe you go home and look your spouse in the eye and ask, How can I help you? Maybe you go back to school and you ask a struggling student, How can I help you? Maybe you go back to your place of worship, your church, your mosque, your synagogue and ask, How can I help you? Maybe we just reach out to a neighbor, someone different than us, someone who looks different from us, someone who votes different from us, someone who lives differently than us, and we just say, How can I help you? That question says, How can I leverage my life for the good of your life? That's how I want to live. I think that's how Christ would want each one of us to live. In his kingdom, he doesn't measure greatness by how many people serve us, but by how many people we serve. So why don't we stand together and go to the Lord in prayer? And today we pray in the name of the one who set of himself in Mark chapter 10 verse 45, for even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many. Let's pray. The Lord, we come to you today with hearts filled with gratitude for the privilege of serving our communities and state. I thank you for the honor of standing here in this esteemed assembly with dedicated leaders who strive to make a difference in the lives of others, bless them and their families for their service. As we reflect on the words of Jesus, Help us to shun misguided ambition that seeks first to be served. Help us to remember that Jesus measures greatness not by how many people serve us, but by how many people we serve. We praise you that Jesus showed us a better way when he willingly died on the cross for our sins and rose from the dead three days later. Forgive us of our sins and strengthen our hands today as we seek to help others in all that we do. Bless our military personnel, law enforcement, health care providers, and educators. Bless Governor Brian Kemp, Speaker Burns, and all who serve this great state. This we pray in Jesus name, amen. Now for the pledge of allegiance to the flag. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Doorkeepers, you may unlock the doors, open the doors, members, you may join Pastor Ricky in this out the any room. Here's a late park man right here brother Ricky grew up John Corbin, German Corbin. you you you you come to order. Members at least get somewhere close to your seats if you can't sit on them. Our doctor of the day is brought to us today by cheerleading Deborah Silcox, Dr. Harlan Star. We welcome Dr. Star and appreciate Dr. Star being here with us and taking care of us. Chairman Tarvan has recognized that chair of the Committee on Information and Audits, Chairman Tarvan. Mr. Speaker, your Committee on Information and Audits has read the journal from the previous legislative day and found it to be correct. And on another note, never let the fear of losing become greater than the excitement of winning. That's pretty profound. I never thought about that. Fear of losing.

We'll move on to the rules calendar members. If we have your attention, we'll begin with the clerk reading the caption to House Results. We'll begin to house resolution 449, Mr. Clerk. House resolution 449, our resident of Cooper, the 45th, a resolution designating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy awareness day. This resolution, I haven't referred to the committee on public health. That committee recommends that this resolution be adopted. Chair Lady Cooper is recognized. She's speak to the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, the House, I'm bringing you House resolution 449. It would designate hypertrophic cardiomyopathy awareness day on the 4th Wednesday of the month of February every year is what we're asking the governor to do. It's really important people learn about this disease. It's to make it simple and cut out that big word. It's a thickening of the heart muscle. It's the most inheritable cardiac disease. And although there's almost a million people diagnosed in the country, 85% goes undiagnosed. And it is also three to five times more lethal than other cardiac diseases. So it's simply asked the governor to make this a special day on the 4th to make people in Georgia where this hidden disease that goes undiagnosed. And with that, Mr. Speaker, I will yield the well and ask for your favorable vote. Thank you. Ladies yield the well. She had no questions. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there an objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the resolution? The chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. The chair shall this resolution now be adopted. All in favor of the adoption of the resolution will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machine. All members voted. All members voted if so. The clerk will lock the machine. All the adoption of House resolution 449, 449. The yeas are 160 nays are zero. The resolution having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore adopted. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 53, 53 House Bill 53, Barbara. The three of our reps and of Corbett of the 174th and others to be entitled to amend part two of Article 1 of Chapter 6 and Title 12 of the fiscal to George annotated relating to practice and professional forestry system, provide the state board of registration for foresters is an independent state agency attached to the state forestry commission. This bill ever referred to the committee on natural resources and environment that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. The chairman Corbett is recognized to present the bill chairman Corbett. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, I'll bring before you House Bill 53 LC 510333 s. I'm sorry. The C442677 s. Mr. Speaker, what we're doing with this bill, we're moving the state board of registrations of foresters from the Secretary of State's Office to the Forestry Commission. The director of the forest commission has a letter. He's in full support of this. The Senate had a study committee over the summer on occupational licenses. This is one of their recommendations. I don't put a whole lot of stock in anything to send it does, but I think they got this one right. The constituents of this state will be better served by the board being moved to the Forestry Commission. The Forestry Commission, they have a location in every county. They have a personal relationship with the citizens of the counties. They know the area and in many times the Secretary of State, when there's an issue of claim of timber theft, they have to call in the forestry commission anyway to do an investigation because they have an investigative arm unit within the forestry commission. I'm moving this. It's going to make for more efficient government. This was unanimous out of the natural resources committee. And then I had one question in rules and had to do with the cost. And if you look online, 64, that's covered. They're setting the fee at $200 for a biennial registration. We've got somewhere between 900 and 1000 registered forestries. This will generate anywhere from 180 to $200,000 in the forest commission estimates. It's cost about $90,000 a year to do this. So the cost will be covered in those fees. So that's what we're doing. If there's no questions, I wouldn't appreciate your favor consideration. You have no questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen, it's you're the well and he's told us how he feels about the Senate. That's a pretty complete deal. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, has none the previous question is ordered? Is there an objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Chair, has none the committee's substitute is adopted? Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, has none the report of the committee is agreed to? Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. All members voted if so. The clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of House Bill 53, the yeas are 164, the nays are zero. The bill haven't received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption to House Bill 282-282? House Bill 282, by resident Maynard 56 and others to be entitled back to men park to Article 6 of Chapter 2, Title 20 of the official go to Georgia and Tate related to competencies and core curriculum under the Quality Basic Education Act. So, to provide for a minimum course of study and career readiness education, this bill I'm referring to the committee on industry and labor, that committee recommends a disbilled do pass by committee substitute. Representative Maynard is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm going to make this the shortest presentation ever. House Bill 282, it's a really simple bill. The soft skills training that people are already doing in the school system sixth grade through 12th grade is being provided. But right now you have to go through red tape school systems must go through red tape to have access to the curriculum. This simply removes the red tape and any school district within the state of Georgia can now use this free soft skills career readiness curriculum training in their school and I'll yield for questions. Ladies, you have a question? One question, Mr. Speaker. One question. Majority leader right in front of you, leader of frustration has a question. Yes, sir. Yes. Representative Maynard, is it not true that in job posting soft skills are requested four times more than hard skills than that 93% of employers deemed soft skills as either essential or very important? You are absolutely right and thank you for that question because I will be remiss in not mentioning that the Georgia Chamber supports this workforce development bill. Right now we have children that are entering into the workforce but unfortunately they do not have the soft skills needed to perform their jobs more efficiently. Thank you and I yield the will. Ladies, you are the will. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Chair, here's none. The committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? All members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of House Bill 282, the yeas are 165, the nays are zero. The bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 409, 409? I'm a representative of the 17th and others to be entitled to amend. To amend the bill, the general provisions applicable to county municipalities and municipal corporations and other governmental entities. So it's authorized local authorities to dispose of real property in the same manner as county governing authorities. This bill has been referred to the committee on government affairs. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Representative Lauren Daniels recognize to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. I rise today to present House Bill 409. This was actually brought to me by local municipal attorney. And I represent Henry County, which is a very large county to be. And one of the things that we are running into is there are authorities that are antiquated in nature all over the state. And how they get rid of real property in terms of easements. So water authorities who are sort of these have to garner easements on personal property. And in order to get rid of them, they do appraisals. But the reason this bill is important is because oftentimes the appraisal ends up costing a county their taxpayers more than what the piece of property itself is worth. So this is an effort to help taxpayers homeowners kind of put all this on the open for since there is a current gap. So this is going to provide public record keeping, encourage that and attempt to streamline and modernize the process. It was favorably reported out of committee. It's kind of a simple bill, if you will, and I ask for your favorable consideration if there are no questions. Thank you. And lady has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, has none the previous question is ordered? Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Chair, has none the committee's substitute is adopted? Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, has none the report of the committee is agreed to? Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes, all those opposed. We'll vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machine. We'll vote no. We'll vote no. We'll vote no. Have all members voted if so, the clerk will unlock the machine. On the passage of the bill, the yeas are, passage of house bill 409, the yeas are 164, the nays are two. The bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will ye read the caption to house bill 912912? House bill 912, my reps, and the 10th and others to be entitled to amend code section 41, 1, the official go to George Anteddin, relating the definitions relative to motor vehicles and traffic. So it was revised the definition of multipurpose off highway vehicle. This bill ever referred to the committee on ways and means that committee recommends a dispelled do pass. Representative Victor Anderson is recognized to present house bill 912. Representative Anderson. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, house bill 912 provides for the exclusion of multipurpose off highway vehicles as was defined in house bill 121 last year from personal property and the law tax. These vehicles are currently taxed at the time of sale through sales tax. And as we were working through the rules with the Department of Revenue, it was suggested to clarify the legislative intent of house bill 121 that we pursue exemption from ad belong tax for these vehicles. Mr. Speaker, I would yield for any questions. Gentlemen, has no questions. Thank you, and I ask for your favorable consideration. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, has none the previous question is ordered?

Shall this bill now pass, all in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine.

have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 912. The yeas are 168, the nays are zero. The bill haven't received a requisite constitutional majority as therefore passed. Members, we're going on to the supplemental rules calendar. In his wisdom, the rules committee has limited debate on House Bill 947. And so we'll abide by those time limits. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 947, 947? By reps that have levered in the 123rd and others to be entitled to an act to amend Article 166 and Title 15. The official go to Georgia and annotate it relating to general provisions concerning superior courts, so it's to modify provisions regarding the compensation received by superior court judges. This bill I'm referring to the committee on judiciary. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chairman, remember, you're ready. Chairman Levert is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. I'm pleased to present to you House Bill 947, a bill that will make some long overdue reforms to the structure of compensation to our states of pellet and superior court judges. The bill restructures compensation for state-paid judges. That is, state-paid judges, judges of the Georgia Supreme Court, the Georgia Court of Appeals, the statewide business court, and our state's superior courts, which are the courts' general trial jurisdiction throughout the state. It does not go beyond these categories because these are only judges that are technically state employees. Other judges are paid primarily by counts. I think one important point to clarify about this bill. It does not raise or change the amount of salaries and it does not appropriate any money. We are not interfering with Chairman Hatchett's jurisdiction in any way. We still leave the appropriations process every year to run its course. And as a matter of fact, as I will mention in a minute, we're actually removing from code a numeric dollar amount in a dollar symbol that is associated with pay for these judges. So I would argue that this bill is giving us more discretion in the manner in which we pay these state-paid judges. The bill proposes to change the legal structure of judicial compensation in Georgia and provide for some procedures for current judges to opt in to the new system. The goal is to move toward a system in which pay is more uniform across the state and not riddled with anomalies and inconsistencies as the 2016 study found. Most of you know, the state is divided into judicial circuits, most consist of multiple counties like where I am in the northern circuit. But some are single counting, like Fulton and the recent Columbia circuit we created. Currently, super court judges have two sources of compensation, the state, because they are state employees after all, and the counties of the circuits in which they serve. Many counties provide supplements to their judges and the amounts vary pretty widely across the state. That has led to great disparities in judicial pay across the state, not just among super court judges. But pay is upside down so that in some cases, judges with greater jurisdiction and responsibility, our public court judges, are paid less than judges with more limited jurisdiction and the Spiracourt. This has, in my opinion, led to a great undervaluing of our public and Spiracourt judges. We currently rank 32nd in what we pay the Spiracourt, 23rd in what we pay our Court of Appeals judges, and the Spiracourt because of the supplement system varies widely. The pay of Spiracourt judges varies from 45th in the country to 5th, depending upon where you sit. And the state-funded portion of Spiracourt pay, despite some statements I've heard made to me, ranks 49th in the country, 49th, we're ahead of only West Virginia. And with all due respect to Representative Drenner, I love West Virginia, but I especially love him because at least they keep them out of the absolute basement in that category. So we strive to structure the circuits. If you've ever been involved in the addition of a new judgeship in your circuit, we strive to structure the circuits so that the caseload is basically the same for any judge, no matter where he sits down in Lyon's County or if he sits in Cobb or Fulton County. So the caseloads are supposed to be roughly even. And as a result, I would submit to you that there's not currently any valid reason for allowing such a wide disparity in pay of our state-spiracourt judges. To put it plainly, there's no reason that a judge out in a rural area should make somewhat less than the judge in the urban area. Conversely, it shouldn't apply the other way under. There should be a more uniform pay system throughout our state. And this bill seeks to do that. It doesn't eliminate county participation in the salaries and compensation of judges, but it tries to limit it to the disparities aren't so significant. The bill creates a base rate salary for the state's portion of the salaries, the state paid judges, and establishes a maximum salary concept that has tied the compensation for judges of the United States District Court for the Northern District up here. This structure allows the General Assembly to adjust the state portion of the salary every year in our discretion. It does not set an amount of salary. Again, I repeat, it does not appropriate or set the salary. I would argue we currently do that in code that one of the code sections that's revised in this bill has a dollar amount of salary for judges of these categories. We're proposing to strike that from code. The bill also doesn't prohibit the local supplements, but going forward will limit them to 10% of whatever the state pay is. And we change the name of it. We call it locality pay to make sure no one gets confused and they understand it's different. It's limited. The bill also provides opting in and grandfathering provisions for sitting judges at the time of passage, because some judges actually would see their pay go down under this system. And so we give them that option. But as judges are replaced or retired, the new judges would all be in the new system. I think to make the point about what the bill does, if you look at section four, which begins on page six, it changes code section 4574. That's the statute that sets out dollar amounts for various state-wide positions, such as Governor Lieutenant Governor and ultimately our states of pellet court judges judge the statewide business court and the Spiricord judges. On lines 166 to 169 on page seven, we strike the dollar amounts of those salaries of the judges of the Supreme Court, judges of the Court of Appeals, the statewide business court and Spiricord. And we replace that on pages 13 and 14 with a maximum, not a set salary, but a maximum expressed as a percentage of the US District Court pay. And the base amount is not even the current year salary. It's salary from two years ago. That's still allow for more planning when we come to our appropriations so we'll know in advance what the max is, but it doesn't mandate that we appropriate that. So the percentages are also structured to avoid this sort of upside down process where some of our states of pellet court judges are paid less. The Georgia Supreme Court, the max, not the mandated salary, but the max would be 100% of that base amount. Court of Appeals would be 95, statewide business court 92 and Spiricord would be 90%. So again, we're not setting a salary amount, we're setting a maximum. We still have to appropriate, if you look at lines 329 to 332, it retains for us our discretion. The salary shall be set by the General Assembly in the General Appropriations Act. We just can't exceed that maximum. So I think although sometimes the expressions of affection for our judicial system in this room are somewhat surprising, they do know where pretty covetous old centers when it comes to our power and authority to appropriate money. That's Tom McCall, you say that's the only thing we absolutely have to do is pass a balanced budget. So this doesn't interfere with that in any way. And I would argue it actually eliminates some of the limitation of that discretion that is currently in the law. And as I said, it's not the current salary. So if we were to fund salaries at the maximums, which I don't believe is contemplated this year or in the short term, it would put us toward the top, but we would not be at the absolute top. Spring Court would be about 15th in the country. Court of Appeals would be 12th and the Spiracourt pay would rank 14th. So I don't believe we are being overly generous to our state's judges, even if we were to appropriate at the maximum. But again, we are not obligated to do that in this bill. It does not set an amount of pay. And the amounts that are proposed as maxes don't even keep up with the rate of inflation over the last 20 years. Judicial pay has actually gone down substantially in terms of real dollars. From some of the comments I've received from some of you that that is certainly not the perception, but that is the reality. And in Section 1, the bill sets out administrative provisions allowing judges to opt into the new system, and which would be the the amount set by the General Assembly plus the locality pay or stay in the current system, which is again a general and similarly appropriated amount plus the supplement. If a judge does not opt in, they would stay in the current system. And again, some judges probably will stay in the current system because their pay is a little better right now. But as they are, as they retire and are replaced, the judges would be in the new system. So another provision that has to do with the the final section deals with the connections between judicial pay and other local officials. There are a number of local officials throughout the state who by ordinance or local act have their salary tied to spear court pay. This bill would suspend that tie for one year. So basically the pay would stay the same for those officials. And it would stay in that top that suspension would stay in effect for one year so that if the counties wanted to make changes, they could do that through the process of passing local acts next year. So if they don't desire to, they don't have to, they can it would resume. So for judges after a year, the the tie is is resume for other local officials, they have to actually take some affirmative act to reconnect it. So that is that is in a nutshell, what the bill does. I look forward to your favorable support of House Bill 947. And Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the wealth of questions. I have a couple of questions, gentlemen, yield. So we have a question, recognize represented L Williams, CLF House District 168 representing Williams. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for gentlemen yield. Yes, sir. Is it not true that the salary is paid to many rule judges and many circuits way below what they could earn in a small private practice? That that's true, yes, sir. Is it not true that justice should not only be blind, but it should also be locally neutral. You should be able to get the same caliber of judge and not lose good people because of the pay. Is that not true? Yes, sir. Is it not also so that because of that reason and the desire to have justice payment to justice is equalized that I support this bill. Thank you very much. Gentlemen, yield. Yes, sir. Representative Brinnell is recognized for question to your left. Does he gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. I know you explained about those judges at a tie because I probate judges tied to our superior court. Could you make that a little bit clear because I'm not really sure how she will fit in? Well, for a judge, the tie is suspended so that the probate judge of salary would stay the same up until next year or as the bill is currently drafted. And then after a year, the tie would go into effect at whatever the spirit court judge salary is at that time unless the county asked you to file a bill next year to make some changes to that. And the idea there is that counties can see what we appropriate and make adjustments before the pay would change because of any changes we make in judicial pay as a result of this bill. Thank you. You're very welcome. Okay, gentlemen has a little bit to do with the appropriations process to your right. Chairman of appropriations, Matt Hatchett has a question. Representative Hatchett. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Absolutely, yes, sir. Isn't it true that I am not an attorney and I don't get paid for the little time that it takes for me to talk about something and explain something, say like to a jury of your peer? I'm sure that's a source of great pride to your mother, yes. So I would I would like to isn't it true that I would like to summarize this bill as this is simply a guideline to follow and that this chamber still holds the purse strings. Absolutely. I would say it's not even a guideline. It's a ceiling that we can't exceed. It doesn't mandate any floor. But thank you for the question. Chairman, you have two more questions if you would yield. I would yield. Yes. Representative Holly to your left in the back. Representative Holly. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman you? Yes, sir. Isn't that true that I wholeheartedly support this bill while in recognition that our judges for them to get paid 49th lowest in the entire country. And that puts them on par with the regular Georgia citizen who workers compensation remains the lowest and has the lowest minimum wage $5.15 an hour and $2.15 plus tips if they wait tables that literally we're putting our judges on a scale of being the lowest in the country. And it needs to change for the judge. We can properly possibly do that for individual people. Would you agree? Well, I agree with part of your statement. Yes, sir. The part in which you said you supported my bill. I thank you very much and Holly Holly support that. Gentlemen, has no further questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask your favorable consideration of this bill. I believe we need it as a statement. It's time to reform and clean up the way in which we pay our state judges so it makes sense. Thank you. Thank you for your presentation and answering the questions. We have several opportunities for speakers on the bill. We have no one signed up and I would welcome the chairman of the committee from which this came, but he has indicated he would like to speak. I don't think he could improve on that. That presentation or the answers. So we will move on. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute that chair, here's none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill that chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. The bill has voted have all members voted if so. The clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 947. The yeas are 154. The nays are 13. The bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. We have a bill will take up that was carried over from Tuesday, I believe. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 1010? House Bill 1010 by the way, I'm going to Jones with 47th and others to be entitled and act to amend chapter 20 to type of 45 of the official go to George annotated relating to personnel administration, relevant public officers and employees. So it's the increase in number of hours permitted for paid parental leave. This bill have been referred to the committee on public and community health. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Thank you, Mr. Clerk. The speaker pro-tim of this house, pro-tim, Jane Jones is recognized to present the bill. Madam, pro-tim. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. So House Bill 1010 changes the current parental leave policy for state employees only from three weeks to six weeks, enhancing a low cost, high value benefit to encourage support, recruit, and retain valued employees. First I'll give a little background. Those of you who are here, remember, Speaker Ralston asked the majority vice chair, Houston Gaines to carry a similar bill in 2021 to change the policy from zero weeks to three weeks of paid parental leave. So, the employees include 170,000 teachers, 822 state patrol officers, defects workers, 6600 corrections officers, and others, and they would all be covered. So, the two-thirds of Georgia state employees are female. Georgia is the largest employer within the state, and we compete primarily with medium and larger employers for a workforce that is primarily skilled or educated. Most of us realize workforce participation is down, and particularly from women, and in not small part due to inflated higher childcare costs that we have today. And if Georgia is to be successful in hiring skilled and educated in particular employees, which are most of the state jobs, then we have to offer not only a competitive salary, which is helped by the raises that Governor Kimp has championed, including the 2500 for teachers this year and a 4% for other state employees up to $3,000. Then we've got to also offer the benefits that in today's society, particularly among millennials and younger, in which most couples, the woman also works, this isn't back the 50s anymore, then we have to offer benefits that they value. I might note that Tennessee and South Carolina recently went to six weeks of parental leave, and we do compete with them on the borders. I will also mention that federal law, stemming back to 1993, called the Family and Medical Leave Act, guarantees 12 weeks of unpaid leave for family or medical reasons. President Trump, on his own, or he implemented 12 weeks of paid leave for federal employees on the birth or adoption of a child, and I'm certainly not trying to match that, but to come up with a reasonable improvement in what we offer. I'll just share a few particular about current law or how this bill will operate. It pertains to state employees for the birth or adoption of a child. It must be taken within 12 months of the birth or adoption that's in current law. That allows a parent with an infant that needs a minor procedure or might develop a problem with nursing to take a couple of the six weeks. I kind of hard to imagine someone not taking all six weeks at once and just having to take leave for the other, but they must have been employed for at least six continuous months full time. Now, some of one person mentioned that why don't they just take short-term disability? The state offers to all state employees that are not teachers, short-term disability, and you can pay so much a month, you have to take a break from either seven days or 30 days depending on which policy you purchase before it kicks in and then it kicks in at 60% of your salary. It would only be eligible for a birth mother not for a father or an adoptive parent. I mentioned the teachers separately because those policies are offered by local school systems and only 11 school systems in the state offer the option of paying for short-term disability. So all the rest of the school systems, those teachers and employees do not have that option. Now, I might note that very few birth mothers in particular are returning to work after three weeks. So school systems in particular are already paying for a substitute teacher because I would venture, I would challenge anyone to find a daycare center that will accept a child before six or eight weeks because of the legal liability and the health risk to such a small infant. If a child in that range comes down with a fever, their hospitalizes happen to one of my children and they have to have a spinal tap and a numerous very intrusive procedures to make sure that they don't have bacterial meningitis or another serious disease. Disease that might not be that serious to an older child, you know, you have time to remedy it with medicine but not with such a young child. So school systems in particular are already paying for a substitute so there's no additional costs there. I worked with Christine Mordak, who's head of our budget. She said agencies, directors, school systems don't budget for this because the cost to them is de minimus. I have all of the school systems and how many people took the parental leave since we implemented the three weeks and it's actually a very few people but it's a very high value benefit to them. Most women in particular, most of their career they're not having children or adopting children but when they do, let me tell you, it matters a lot to them. So most of them are taking, they save up if they have it available and if another child hadn't been sick or they've been sick, they save up their sick leave which of course is generally intended for people who are sick. So I want them coming into work sick or their vacation time or they take unpaid leave for whatever time they want. Now just remember what you're asking, let's say a female to do who just had a baby if she takes unpaid leave or an adoptive father, you're asking them to, when they take unpaid leave, they come off the health, the state health benefit plan. You have to pay both sides of the state health benefit plan in addition to giving up their salary at frankly a very stressful time. So in summary, I just want to ask for your favorable consideration for House Bill 1010 to extend paid parental leave from three weeks to six weeks for state employees to provide a low cost high value benefit to help recruit and retain and tangibly employees and tangibly demonstrate our respect and support for them at a most significant and life changing event in their life. And with that, let's just make it I'd be happy to answer any questions. Ladies, we'll answer a question or two. So here we go. Represent Frazier to your left and back of the room on your left has a question. Represent Frazier is recognized. Thank you. That's a lady. You yes, I did. I just like to know how does this relate to parents that have children with preexisting diseases. For example, sickle cell and they actually have crises maybe once a week and they might have to be off work for a week until that child passes that crises and then they might have another crises next month. So will they be able to use this lead for that purpose? I'm sympathetic to the situation that you're bringing up, but this only pertains to the birth or adoption of a child that's paid parental leave. We did pass and I know members of both parties worked on legislation.

earlier that allows, excuse me, for five paid leave days for situations such as you're describing. But that is not addressed in this bill. That's the lady for the year. Yes, sir. But what if this parent had a baby that was sickle? That was what? Has sickle sale. That was born with sickle sale. Right. So if a child born with a born with a heart defect or sickle sale or other really unfortunate problems, this would not pertain for that specifically except for they would get up to six weeks of paid leave on the birth or the adoption of that child. Thank you. We represent Townsend to your right. Has a question. The gentleman's recognized. Does it get any help? Yes, I do. Is it not true, Madam Speaker, for a town that this is also a workforce development issue. This does help in the hiring process where we can match benefits from the local industry. And this is a good thing for education and keeping our teachers employed and retained in our local school systems. Yes, it does. And I appreciate that question coming from a former and retired school superintendent. Representative Lisa Campbell to your left has a question. Ladies recognize for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the general woman yield? Yes, it is. Is it not true that this is a very positive bill that I wholeheartedly support because if women in Georgia participated in the labor force at the same rate as women in countries with paid leave, there would be an estimated 174,000 additional workers in the state. And 5.6 billion more wages earned statewide. And that programs like this paid leave improve employee retention if you have previously shared. Well, I'm sure the lady knows that of which she speaks and you have the facts and figures. Well, I appreciate the discussion. And with that, Mr. Speaker, I'm going to realize we're getting late for lunch. And I'm going to yield the well. But I do ask for your favorable consideration. Thank you. Madam Pro Tem, you're returning your seat. Your seat may have been anxiously asking, wanting to ask a question. I'm sure you all didn't talk about that when you all were sitting down. Well, I'll take one last question. One last question. Representative Gaines has a question. General is recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Will my seat mate yield? Yes, I will. I know you mentioned President Trump past 12 weeks of paid parental leave at the federal level. That's true. They have uncle Trump specifically supported the bill we passed three years ago. That is true. And I recall that. Thank you, sir. And with that, I'll yield the well. Okay. The ladies yielded well. We have some speakers lined signed up to speak. We'll recognize representative Mary Francis Williams to speak to the bill. Reptini Williams. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. So I want to thank Speaker Pro Tem Jones and Chairwoman Dempsey and the other signers and sponsors of this bill. This is a really wonderful bill. As Speaker Pro Tem Jones mentioned, it increases the amount of paid parental leave upon the birth, adoption, or taking a child into foster care from 120 to 240 hours. So I wanted to share a little bit of history with you though. This House has really paid a, played a strong leadership role in supporting parental and family care leave for several years. Before I was elected as a state representative, I worked for six years with many of you to pass what we call the Family Care Act. And this would address the issue that Representative Frazier mentioned, the Parent Protection Act, which in 2017 passed and it will allow the use of up to five days of sick leave for the care of an immediate family member. So that was a real step forward. And this House really, that was not, that was not easily passed. There was a lot of opposition, but this House stood firm and was really, really wonderful. There was support from the Speaker's Office and from other Chairman and a Chairman, John Meadows was, was someone who was very particularly interested and strongly supported. So I want to share with you some info about why parental leave for new parents is important, including adoptive and foster parents. Family leave is essential not only for health of the newborn, but for health of the mother. And we've talked a lot in this House about maternal mortality. I think it makes sense to all of us, particularly those of us who've had babies and dealt with newborns or adopted a newborn, that those weeks after the arrival of this new baby are tough. And in terms of maternal mortality, there are a lot of issues that just don't become apparent until three or four months after delivery. So if the mother is at home with a baby, she's probably in a situation where she is going to have a better, better health outcome. Some of the complications for new moms are sleep deprivation and dads, new dads too. Inability to think clearly and ask for help, negative thoughts and feelings. There's a positive correlation between mental health and paid maternity leave. It can lead to better bonding experiences between the mother and the child. Pay parental leave for adoptive and foster care parents. So children need bonding time with siblings. They need to adjust to becoming a parent is an experience of life and lack of paid adoption leave. There's a lot of employees to choose between a paycheck and time where they're child. Adding a new addition to your family, I know all of us know this is not an easy thing. It's a major life event. It's a beautiful thing and we need to support families. And let's talk a little bit about paternity leave for those of you who are dads. It's possible for employees to be better fathers and better partners while also being inspiring leaders. The pluses of paternity leave are lifting family relationships, strengthening partnerships, improving finances. And also I have read that there is actually a decline in domestic violence cases in these situations where the father is involved and takes paternity leave. So again, thank you to Speaker Pro Tem Jones and other sponsors of the bill for their leadership on this issue. I'm so proud to speak on behalf of this bill and I'm proud of the years of leadership that this House has exhibited in supporting families who need time to take care of their loved ones. Thank you so much, Mr. Speaker. Lady, taking questions or she's yielding the will. Is there a question for the lady in the will? I think you have no questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies, you are the will. Representative Bennett has recognized the speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of House Bill 1010 and I would like to thank Madam Speaker Pro Tem for bringing this bill. What it does is sends a signal to the people of Georgia that those elected to represent them under the gold dome actually really care about their families and their children. What is so exciting for me about this bill is that it doubles the paid parental leave for state employees at this time. I'm hopeful, Madam Speaker Pro Tem, about the prospect of continuing to expand parental leave beyond just state employees and beyond what we have right now. But this is a great, a great first start and I am just so excited about it. So I hope that this bill will continue to have a domino effect as we continue to support our families of all kinds in the state of Georgia. Thank you, Madam, for bringing this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield the will. Ladies, yield the will. Representative Odin Sanya is recognized as the speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Like the two general ladies who spoke before me, I too rise in support of House Bill 1010 of which increases the number of hours permitted for paid parental leave to six weeks. As many of you know, paid parental leave in Georgia is three weeks for state employees and that includes school teachers. If this bill passes, we are on course to changing that to six weeks. And this is a sort of direction that we ought to be moving in Georgia. We have to always find ways to advance legislation that makes life of Georgia is easier, better, not worse off. Under this bill, six weeks will be offered to the 300,000 state employees we have. Including about 170,000 teachers. And several studies have found that the length of paid leave is crucial for maternal and infant health. And studies also suggest that less than six weeks of paid leave is linked to a reduction in overall health status and increased depression in both mothers and fathers. As a father of three daughters myself, including an eight month old, I cannot test to first hand that providing access to paid parental leave. In this day and age, it's one important way to advance gender and racial equity in Georgia. And when you look closely, the public sector workforces made up of women and people of color. The two groups who are likely, who are typically less likely to have access to paid leave. So by ensuring that these individuals do not lose out on critical income while fulfilling their care-given responsibility, this bill in my view moved towards the, this bill in my view, moved towards promoting economic security for Georgia, for Georgia's family. It was also found that women were received paid leave have a lower chance of reporting intimate partner violence. And this is the sort of bill we ought to be spending taxpayers running, working on, not wasting precious time like we did on Tuesday, talking about borders in Texas and finding cynical ways to continue dividing our great country. As human beings, we are elected to do the people's work. We each have a responsibility to care for humanity. And when you take care of others, you ultimately are on the way to discover your own joy and to have a happy life. So we will continue to elevate the voice of the people. We will continue to do the people's work. And we will continue to deliver a victory to the people of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Are you the role? The gentleman as you do the well, representing Jasmine Clark, is recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon, colleagues. I think I'm standing between you and lunch, so I'll keep this brief. Today, I rise in support of this measure because it is momentum in the right direction. Previously, in this chamber, we passed a bill that would allow only three weeks of paid parental leave for state employees. A very hesitant to support that measure because three weeks falls well short of the gold standard for parental leave, which is 12 weeks. Giving birth is no small feat and can wreak havoc on the body. Those first six to eight weeks after labor and delivery are a time of recovery and healing and can be marked by pain and fatigue as the body recovers. It's not glamorous, but the postpartum recovery period can include things like pelvic pain, constipation, healing from surgery after a C-section, and so much more. This is also a time for learning how to adjust to a new routine, changing diapers, establishing a feeding schedule, and finding that time to sleep whenever you can. And we can't leave out the invaluable bonding time with the newest members or members of our family. Also, as was stated, most child care centers do not accept infants younger than six weeks, so this bill also addresses child care issues as well. Three weeks was better than nothing, but it was still quite insufficient. This bill we are voting on today gets us halfway to the gold standard of 12 weeks and at least better aligns with the new parents' physical recovery needs. So I support this bill because I hope that it is a sign that 12 weeks paid leave currently available to federal workers is on the horizon. I also hope that one day this type of leave would be available to all working new parents in our state. And with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. The lady has yielded the well represented Lauren Daniel is recognized to speak to the bill. I'm saying Daniel. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and thank you, Madam Proton, for bringing this bill. It has been an honor to work alongside you in this effort. This is something that's really important for the women of this state and really the children of this state. The benefits are undeniable. No, we know that children are better off when they're close to their moms. Like you've seen it. I have brought my child every day and many of you have talked about how well behaved he is and how happy he is and the truth is it's because he's with me. I'm able to take care of him on a way that is not traditional, but I hope by showing you guys this and showing, you know, business owners across the state, this that it is possible. It's a good thing. It's good for the moms. It's good for babies. But when it comes to paternal leave, it is necessary. I'm glad that we're increasing it. I have had some questions on whether or not we should include men. And I want to tell you why we should. So I had severe complications with my pregnancy. Ended up having an emergency CC section. I have three older kids and I was not clear to drive until I was four weeks postpartum. So that left my husband who's absolutely wonderful and super supportive to drive my kids everywhere, to take care of them and every capacity to get them to their sports, to get my daughter to ballet while I was stuck in a bed with a newborn. And so when we talk about this, we are talking about every scenario that could possibly be under the sun and how to best support them. You heard about we've heard a lot about maternal mortality. It does play effectiveness. So we are, this is really this bill is just yet another step. And how we in the chamber are leading the way. And I really hope that when it comes to maternal and infant health, we're going to continue to do things like this here in Georgia. And I mean, I think it speaks for itself. I'm very thankful to be a part of it. And I ask for your favorable consideration. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The lady is yielded well. The representative town said is recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you Madam Prutem for the bill. I just speak briefly. Mainly from the school and when I was a principal or CEO of a college career academy and then a superintendent, I saw the need back then. I saw the first need when my wife was a cheat teacher as well and did this. So they actually leave if you don't have the time built in as veteran teachers do this extra leaves critical. And this is one of the considerations you do when you interview people. They ask about families and how that's going to work. And they ask you those questions and you have to be honest with them. You have to tell them what the benefits are. What's going to happen when you get here? And if you don't do that, then they're not going to trust you anyway down the line. So this bill is critical for workforce development. It's not going to break the bank of anybody else. It's a good bill. It's a bill. I don't think there's a principle in the states that would oppose this bill, especially when it comes higher and sees in the spring. So just on behalf of former educators, current educators, I think it's a good bill. And hopefully you'll see it the same way. Appreciate your viewpoint representative. Chair Lady Silcox is recognized to speak to the bill. That concludes our supporters of the bill. All that's spoke were in favor. Maybe a new record. Mr. Clerk, if you'll ring that bill just two or three times, everyone know we're ready to vote. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machine. I have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 1010. The yeas are 153. The nays r 11. The bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. House Bill 424 will be postponed to the next legislative day. For what purpose is Chair Lady Ballinger rise? I'd like to make a motion. State your motion. I would like to move the bill, House Bill 924 from the Health Committee to the Public Health Committee. Both chairs are in agreement. Thank you. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? House Bill 924, Ballinger, the 23rd, and others to be entitled to amend Chapter 24, Title 33, the fiscal to Georgia, annotated, relaying the insurance generally serves to prohibit insurers from discriminating against certain health care facilities and providers. On the ladies' motion, at HB 924, be withdrawn from the Health Committee and recommitted to the Public Health Committee is the objection. Here in none, it is so ordered. We have 9 afternoon orders. That's 9, that's 1 list and 10. So I'm going to give you all 1 minute to present your afternoon orders. We will start with a representative talented for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Exciting news, those a week from yesterday on Tuesday. Next Tuesday will be, going out on a chamber day, we'll have a low-country bowl at the depot. We're going to have drinks and appetizers, adult drinks and kids drinks at 5 o'clock and then followed by the low-country bowl. So we invite you out there for that, you know it's going to be a good day. Also if you want to see the steamed woody wood side, I think most of us know woody, that's a good time to catch them at the depot. So again, next Tuesday, going out on a day here at the Capitol, you'll see about 100 of us here and low-country bowl, looking forward to seeing you. Mr. Chairman Hogan coming? He is done. He didn't permission from Libby, so you know what I'm saying? Well, maybe woody can handle it. The representative draper is recognized for an afternoon order. We'll pass her right now. Representative Kendrick is recognized for an afternoon order. She passes right now. Representative Kelly. He's here. You know what I'm recognized. Thank you, Speaker. Today's a historic day in Cedar Town and Polk County in the 16th District. This morning Governor Kemp announced that solar cycle and advanced manufacturing facility is locating in the Cedar Town Industrial Park, making a $344 million investment and bringing with them about 600 jobs. It was a great collaborative effort between our state, our county, and our cities all working together to attract this great industry to Polk County in Cedar Town, and we're glad to have them. So thank you to all the hard work from our economic development teams at all levels of government and welcome to the 16th District. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Congratulations to you and the community. That's awesome. Thank you, Senator Val Williams. Gentlemen from the coast. You recognize for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. If you look at the screens here, that's a photograph of a school in Bryan County, which was then Ways Station, standing in the middle there. I know you don't think this is the gentleman to the right, but the gentleman to the left is my grandfather, and the gentleman to his left is Henry Ford. Henry Ford has just agreed to build a new school for African Americans in Ways Station where my granddad, it was the postmaster before it was named Richmond Hill. And my mother taught at that school for three years and Henry Ford paid her salary. We've come a long ways, but Henry Ford built the finest rule school for African Americans in Georgia in Bryan County, Georgia. That's a moment in little known black history. That was Ways Station, which is now Richmond Hill. Thank you, Representative. Representative Hendrix. There she is. Recognize for an afternoon. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. You should have received a flyer in your office about the 2024 tech demo day that I'm hosting on February the 29th, so we'll have some tech founders that are going to be set up in the South Wing. So please stop by from 8 to 12 and lend them your support. We will have some black founders as well in celebration of black history months. So thank you to the technologists of color and the Urban League of Greater Virginia. We'll have Atlanta and start up Atlanta for helping to host this. So please stop by. You'll get more details as we get closer to the event and less support our tech founders here in the state. Thank you. Representative Holly has recognized for an afternoon order. Please give the gentleman the way or you're attention. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. House one recognize for a black history tribute. A man who we all actually have felt his impact even though we did not know his name. Sherman Lofton, Jr. He's a faithful son of late Georgian by the same name. He's also the senior director for Cybersecurity Operations at Georgia Tech. Today he wears his black and gold as the 14th Georgia district director of the Alpha, by Alpha and corporate fraternity. However, Sherman Lofton, Jr. made it into Georgia history this past year. Or rather last year when he followed in the footsteps of justice stalwarts like Thurgood Marshall and Homer Plessy by filing his cause of action. Alpha by Alpha and corporate versus state of Georgia which successfully saw our legislature redraw the voting maps to maintain fair districts for everyone. So thank you. We honor you today. Thank you, Representative. Representative Noel Williams and the House Dance Team. Dance off team. Oh, excuse me. Dance or. Where's Danny Matt? There he is. We need our wives here too. He's got a little spring in his tent there. I tell you what. Oh, yeah.

Well, that was going through my mind when we were facing them in the dance hall. That was no thought coming. I knew we were going to win. And we won again for the second year in the row. Next year, hope it's a bigger event. We want to kick ball. We want to dance and then we win and legislate. And so I don't think we can say anything else. All right. Let's see something. Now I wanted you to dance. I didn't want you to put it up here. That's good. Awesome. Thank you, gentlemen. The ball was getting ready to roll off. I didn't want to break anything else up here. Congratulations. Thank y'all. We're going to have to recognize for an afternoon order. Well, I don't know how to follow that. I just wanted to re-invite everybody. Tomorrow, we're going to be having a 2 p.m. tomorrow on the South Steps. A press conference honoring our state's sexual assault centers. We're going to have a lot of people who do great work with sexual assault and domestic violence survivors. We just want to lift them up and educate people on the good, life-saving work that they do. So 2 o'clock tomorrow, South Steps would love to have your support. Thanks. Thank you, Representative. Chairman Sains, recognize for an afternoon order.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the efforts of our Governor, First Lady, and this General Assembly in combating human trafficking in Georgia. Human trafficking isn't simply an Atlanta problem. It isn't only a city issue. It's an issue affecting communities across Georgia, impacting our young people, our churches and our businesses. We've advanced the work of the Grace Commission alongside our speaker, our Governor, and our amazing First Lady, Marty Kemp, bringing together folks from across the aisle to fight for those who need a champion. We've worked to protect those trapped in human trafficking from being entrapped in our court battles, and we've worked to provide for those escaping human trafficking, giving the resources for them on the road to recovery. I know this House majority will continue to lead a bipartisan effort to help those that need help, rebuilding their lives and sending the criminals for this to our state's penal institutions where they belong. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Representative Stinson is recognized. Give the letter you're attention.

Michael Anthony Woodall was a dedicated and faithful public servant whose life was tragically cut short on June 15, 2023 at the tender age of 26, doing services at the District 3 Assistant Highway Maintenance Forming with the Georgia Department of Transportation. Last year in June, unfortunately, Michael lost his life as the DOT truck was driving down a state highway, and unfortunately a tree fell over onto the truck that he was driving in, and he instantly went home to be with the Lord. So we ask for a moment of silence in honor of Michael Anthony Woodall of Taylor County Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
