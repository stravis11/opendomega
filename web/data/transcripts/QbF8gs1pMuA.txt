TRANSCRIPT
----------
And ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.
I have some really smart good friends, so Lisa just told me to remind everybody to turn
off your phones, okay?
So thank you, Lisa, for keeping me straight.
If you have phones, make sure they're in the off position.
As I describe these ceremonies, both, this is an unveiling ceremony.
Many of you have been to the induction ceremony, which is always held down in Columbus, Georgia,
always the first Saturday in November veterans month.
The way we describe that ceremony and this ceremony is emotional because your emotions
are all over the place.
It's the happiness of a wedding and the salimony of a memorial service.
So I think you'll get the full impact that as we go along.
Lieutenant Governor Jones, Senator to Harbison, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,
Good afternoon and welcome to the Georgia Military Veterans Hall of Fame unveiling ceremony
for the 31 inductees from the classes of 2021 and 2022.
Also as Paul's here, we normally have one class at a time, but because of COVID and other
things, we're combining these two classes.
General Wright, right here.
It's always good to make an entrance.
Right on that second row right there.
My name is Colonel Retired Rick White and I have the humble privilege of being the director
of this rare and noble Hall of Fame for our great state.
the inception of the GMV HOF in 2013, a grand total of 162 Georgia veterans have
inducted. In today's ceremony marks the second time that an unveiling ceremony has
been conducted in our beautiful state capital. By the way, I didn't know until
about two years ago and Roger Wise informed me and in brief me, this is the
official museum of the state of Georgia. Many of you, I lived your all my life
except while I was in the Army for 31 years. I didn't know this was the
fishing museum. So when you have a chance today or whenever, enjoy yourself, walk around
and see this beautiful building as a museum.
At this time, I mean, as the program progresses, more information will be provided about
the Hall of Fame. And at this time, I will introduce Master Chief, J-R-O-T-C, Master
Chief Petty Osser, Jorge Schisneros.
He is the commander of the troops for the ceremony today.
Commander, please post the troops.
Samoye Dijon, up, ten, ten.
Watch him ride! Beats him!
Go for it! Watch him!
Ladies and gentlemen, I know it's in your program, but I want to just spend special
recognition to these three great JROTC programs.
The King's Academy, Army JROTC, led by Colonel Rick Steppett, Senior Military Science Instructor,
Naval J.R.O.T.C. from Alituna High School,
Akworth, Georgia, Lieutenant Colonel Jeffrey Knudsen,
Senior Naval Science Instructor, Air Force J.R.O.T.C.
from Lovejoy High School, Hampton, Georgia,
with retired major, United States Air Force
Retired Major, Colleen Murray,
Senior Aerospace Science Instructor.
If this doesn't make you feel good
about the youth of America,
and we hear so many negative things about the youth of America,
This is the upside, this is the positive.
For that, I'd like to give these young men
and women a round of applause.
Applause.
You know, most of us grew up saying,
yes, ma'am, no, ma'am, yes sir, no sir, please, thank you.
These people to the person does that.
I had a good chance this morning to talk to many of them.
So polite.
So, my hat's off my salute to their instructors.
Thank you so much.
At this time, as we always do since 2013, since the inception,
there will be no polyphane ceremony or meeting or gathering
without an opening prayer and a closing prayer.
And along with that thing we've established,
I'd like to introduce,
lost my notes here.
Introduce Pastor Mark Beatty.
And Mark is the, let me find my notes here.
He's the pastor of the Holy Trinity Lutheran Church in Marietta.
And no Mark is also the chaplain
of our John Screek Veterans Association
and great man, great veteran,
Air Force veteran, pastor.
In thanksgiving and gratitude for this day, let us pray together.
God of all creation, God of life, God of love, we thank you for the many blessings you
shower upon us for the breath of life this day, for the freedom to honor your name here in this place.
For the freedom of being able to say openly and joyously, this is the day that the Lord has made.
Let us rejoice and be glad in it. For love and for life, you have sacrificed for us.
you reign and lead by serving and giving. You stand in power and might for the
powerless and the meek. You are life-giving. But we who strive to be your
faithful followers, stray to seek our own ways, our own narratives, our own
control our own power too often we don't love you like you love us nor do we
love our neighbors as ourselves but we are both saint and sinner though we
stray yet we were created good and you yourself proclaimed it so in the
word through the power of your word of your grace and through your spirit some
of us, your children have been called to a unique godly service, beyond the norm of
civilian, secular, and culture. Some have been called to serve in selfless sacrifice,
in leadership that is ultimately serving and giving, being willing to give of their
very lives so that others might live abundantly. We remember some of the bravest, the most
selfless, the most giving, the most faithful and serving of those you have called, and
their acts of courage and godliness through sacrifice and selflessness.
May the Georgia Military Veterans' Hall of Fame serve to honor the godly selfless service
of all those who have been called and named, that their faithful actions might be a witness
and a legacy of what self-giving love truly is and may the memory of their service be a
lamp for this nation and a light unto your path as we give thanks to you for each of
these precious service men and women. Together as one in your life giving name of freedom
We pray, amen.
Cadet Captain Jimmy Holton from Lovejoy High School,
Air Force Gerald T.C. will now lead us
in the pledge of allegiance.
You may be seated.
As you can see in our program agenda, our host for today's ceremony is State Senator
Ed Harbison from Columbus.
Senator Harbison is the United States Marine Corps veteran, a Vietnam war veteran, the
recipient of the Purple Heart for wounds received in combat.
Dr. Harbison was inducted into the Georgia Military Veterans Hall of Fame in the second
class in 2014, and is the inducted sweet sequence number is 27.
Of all the true words that you will hear today, my statement that, without the steadfast
and passionate support of Senator Ed Harbison, the state of Georgia would not have a Hall
of Fame for its veterans, and we all thank him for that.
Ladies and gentlemen, Senator Harbison.
Applause
Good afternoon.
Thank you so much, Colonel White, for the matchless job you and my good friend Long,
Colonel Long Reddough for veterans in the state of Georgia.
Hello and good afternoon to you all.
I am so glad to be here today to honor the 2021 and the 2022 inductees to the Georgia
military of veterans Hall of Fame to reintroduce myself.
I'm Senator Ed Harbisson, and I am the Senator for the District 15 area of our state.
And the 14th, as you heard, inductee into the Hall of Fame is my greatest honor since
I've been serving in the Georgia State Senate.
you kind of white, direct of this esteemed organization, along with my good friend Roger
Wise, and all members of the Georgia military of Venice Hall of Fame, for allowing me to
have the privilege of hosting today's event. I am truly humbled to be here, under the
gold home to command and pay tribute to the courageous men and women of Georgia who served
and the uniformed services of our great country,
the United States of America.
These men and women, bravest they are,
have exemplified great valor,
achievement and service to our nation.
And I'm overjoyed to welcome them
to the growing list of heroes
and the Georgia military veterans, Hall of Fame.
I would like to take this time to welcome our speaker
for the ceremony today.
My good friend, Lieutenant Governor Bert Jones,
and the Georgia Department of Veteran Service
Commissioner Patricia Ross.
Let's give them a great round of applause a bit.
Applause.
It is an honor to have such highly recognized public servant
and leaders to be here today to say they appreciate
what you do, what you are, to Georgia, and what you represent.
Once again, thank you so much for being here today
as we honor our Georgia patrons.
At this time, please welcome my great friend,
Lieutenant Governor Bert John.
Well, good afternoon. I hope that young ladies are all right. We have an infirmary here in
the capital and hopefully we'll get her assistance right there. I hate that. But thank you young
people for being here today and I appreciate everything you're doing. I will be a
brief in comments and because I know we do have the largest inductee group, Hall of Fame
inductee group in the in the history of the Hall of Fame. And so I want to congratulate
each and every one of you. I want to thank my good friend Senator Ed Harvison. He's obviously
a member of the Hall of Fame himself. He's a retired colonel, Army veteran, and he is an Army
excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, excuse me Marine and I apologize to that now yeah good Lord
give me a hug you you can vlog me later on round to that but no he's a retired Marine and you
know it took and he's such a humble guy it took us several years of he served in the Senate before
he started really kind of telling me about stories about him serving in Vietnam and and being a purple
heart recipient and he's truly a great American and a war hero and I appreciate his service
not just to the United States military but to the state of Georgia as well. I'd be remiss
if I didn't recognize retired Lieutenant Colonel Mike Dugan here who is also serving the
state senate, a good friend of mine and colleague and our Commissioner of Insurance, two-star
general John King. Thank you guys. Let's give those gentlemen a round of applause for
of their public service, everything like that.
We are so fortunate to have so many men and women in this room who are willing to serve
and who have served, and we want from the bottom of our hearts, we'd like to thank each
and every one of you for your service to this country and to your service to the state
of Georgia.
I had a five star general one time and I was a young man, just elected to the state
Senate. He was a General Peter Bowling and he was like most five star generals. He
told you exactly what he thought about things and he was the president at the time of George
military college and I never will forget he told me he said you know if it wasn't for
the young men and women in this country who are willing to serve a man in this country
a person can go their entire life and not know their coward because of the service and
the work that the people in this country do, many women in our military service do for
this country, and it, you know, it, it was profound a statement at the time, but as I've
gotten older, it's really sunk in that we enjoy the, in this country, we take for granted
the luxuries that we have and the freedoms that we have as individuals and citizens of
this country, and it's all because of the, the men and women who are willing to serve
in the United States military.
And I just want to tell each and every one of you
from the bottom of our hearts, we appreciate your service.
We want to congratulate you on this award,
on being honored and recognized for your service.
And we're so proud to have heading
our, the commissioner here today, heading our,
our veteran services up here in the state of Georgia,
retired Colonel Ross is here today.
and she is doing a fantastic job.
She is someone who retired from the military in 2014
and she has done an exceptional job
and I know we'll continue to do a great job
as in that role as a commissioner of veteran services
because we do have over 400,000 veterans living here
in the state and it is vital that we cater to their needs
cater to their needs and she has the resources and we're committed to making sure that she has the resources to do that and
And I'm so appreciative of Senator Harbson for all the hard work that he did to make this possible and
And without without further delay
Introduce our commissioner commissioner Ross here today
Thank you, Lieutenant Governor Jones.
Having heard you speak several times,
I have the unenviable position of following you,
so I am very honored and humbled to be here
amongst such heroes.
And I do wanna tell our young men and women on the stairs
having been in many formations myself
during my 25 years in the military,
don't lock your knees.
That is the key to success.
Okay, so today we joined together
to recognize those Georgian heroes
who exemplify our core values, those of service,
integrity, commitment, excellence, loyalty.
And with less than 1% of our population
joining the United States military,
it's important that we take the time
to recognize these men and women
who selflessly gave of themselves.
Whether it be physically and lands
across the globe and in hostile environments,
or whether it be spiritually and emotionally,
because in war, all are wounded.
And I can say to a person, we faced our demons.
While many would call it resilience
or the capacity to withstand and recover quickly,
from our difficulties for this group before us,
they've not just recovered, but have come back stronger,
overcoming some of the most difficult obstacles
humanly imagined.
I want to thank not only the individuals
recognized today, but the Georgia military veterans
Hall of Fame, who recognizes about 15 veterans a year
of our almost 700,000 veterans here in the state of Georgia.
They recognize those that have exemplified what's best
in all of us.
And while no one joins the military for selfish gain or glory,
Instead, we join because we believe in a cause
that is greater than ourselves.
And I dare say the individuals we're recognizing today
are infinitely humble and probably uncomfortable
with this recognition.
But not only do we owe this recognition to these heroes,
we owe it to these junior ROTC students here today
and the hundreds and thousands of school children
who will tour this capital and see these photos
so that they know that we, the state of Georgia,
values our military and our veterans.
George Washington said,
the willingness with which our young people
are likely to serve in any war,
no matter how justified,
shall be directly proportional
to how they perceive the veterans of earlier wars
were treated and appreciated by their nation.
Today we appreciate these heroes
who rushed into the heat of battle,
made institutional changes,
or committed to a life of service
after their military time.
And today, we tangibly show the value we place
on the service of our military.
And we make every effort to ensure that they are recognized
for doing what so few in our nation have dared to do.
That is dawn of the military uniform,
an answer that call to go wherever the president
and our nation says is in our national security best interest.
And the words of Bernard Malamud,
without heroes, we are plain people
and we don't know how far we can go.
These heroes here today show us all what's possible.
Health Street comes from adversity
and health selfless service can have a ripple effect
that impacts countless others.
So on behalf of Georgia's Department of Veteran Service,
I want to thank you.
Let me say that again.
I want to thank you.
Licensurist, thank you for all that you have done,
for our nation, and for the state of Georgia.
And with that, I will turn it back over to Colonel Rick White.
Applause
The commissioner reminded me of something
When she talked about raising your right hand, many of you have heard me say this before
that you've gone through listening to me, but I never passed the opportunity to talk
about what the Bible says about veterans and military service members.
One verse is found in the Old Testament and one verse is found in the New Testament.
In the Old Testament, in Isaiah 6, 8, there's two questions in one answer.
And every time a man or woman stands before that officer of enlistment or commissioning,
they are in fact in essence quoting, Isaiah 6, 8.
Two questions are, whom shall I send?
Who will go for us?
The immediate quick answer is,
here am I, send me.
Every time a young man or woman raises that right hand
and takes that sacred life-changing oath
to join our United States military,
they are in fact saying, here am I, send me.
And once they've taken that oath,
they fall into the next verse,
John 1513, which I'm sure most of you are very familiar with,
and it tells what that service man or woman
is willing to do.
Greater love has no one than this
than to lay down their lives for a friend.
And those friends are you and me and the people they know,
people they don't know, people around this world
that have asked for the freedoms that we enjoy.
And so many times, take for granted in our country,
that's what young men and women do in our military.
If you see us soldier to quote Roger Wise, walk up and say thank you for your service.
If you see someone that's a first responder, thank you for our safety.
As each inductee's name is red, if able, the inductee or a representative of the inductee
will stand or raise their hand as their JROTC cadet will present the beautifully framed
photograph and citation of that inductee. Please hold your applause until all
31 inductees have been announced. The inductees' citations that you see in
the frames will not be read during this presentation, but rather only their
name and the categories for which they have been nominated will be
announced. In your program is a shorter version of the inductees'
citations. For the ten posthumous inductees and those inductees that are
unable to be with us today, a family member, a friend or another veteran will stand in their place.
A bell will be wrong for the three killed in action inductees and the seven deceased inductees.
This is the first time that this new Georgia military veterans' Hall of Fame bell
will have been used in a ceremony. This bell is inscribed and dedicated to all that have given
their lives or freedom and also our POWs and MIAs. The base that this bell's
restaurant is in memory of the late quote submarine Mike Kotler. Many years ago
submarine Mike started the tradition of ringing a Navy bell for those of our
deceased inductees. Unfortunately Mike passed away just shortly a few weeks ago.
His son Alexander Kotler is with us here today from New York City and as we
dedicate this bell and demonstrate what the bell sounds like. Alex will stand
beside the bell as United States Army first sergeant retired, Marshall Huckabee.
Inducty number 89 will now ring the bell as it is now being dedicated.
That will be what you will hear when we announce a deceased or killed in action veteran.
Now we'll present the inductees of the classes of 2021 and 22, 22 along with their frame
photographs and citation.
I'm going to go slightly out of order due to honor and help another veteran who needs
to make it to the airport.

All hearts and minds clear? Dear Lord, we most humbly thank you for this auspicious opportunity
to honor the inductees and the families that gave so much to support their loved ones and
endeavors. Lord, as our friend Winston Mendez reminds us that we must never forget or fail to
appreciate the investments and the sacrifices of those who gave and who have gone before us to
create and secure our form of government and the God who has given it to us and allowed us to live
here. We ask, Lord, to make patriotism a part of our character. Lord, we can all
improve by acquiring positive character traits that will bless our entire
lives as well as our performance for you. We pray for the gold star, mothers and
fathers who have returned their loved ones to you in the sacrifice of their
service. Lord, we thank the state of Georgia. The leaders of this state are veterans, the
families, the youth that are doing such a wonderful job and are going to carry the torch for
the rest of us. And last but not least, Lord, the men and women of the Georgia military
Veterans Hall of Fame and our fearless leader, Rick White, who gives so much to the life
of the organizations.
We also pray that you put a head to protection around Tommy Clark for healing and comfort.
As we leave from this place but not from your presence, Lord, leading guide us with the
blessings of patriotism, compassion, respect, and love.
and it's in your name, we pray, amen.
