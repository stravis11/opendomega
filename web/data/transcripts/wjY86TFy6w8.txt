good morning. It's a beautiful day out there today. Before we begin, the chair wants to
make mention that today's a special day in the history of this house. I know there's
going to be a morning order later this morning, but today Speaker Tom Murphy would have been
97 years old. His birthday today. Speaker Murphy served 28 years as the speaker of this
body, and at the time he left, he was the longest-serving speaker in the history of the United
States.
I think now he's the second-longest-serving speaker in American history.
A great, great Georgian left his mark on this state, a son of rural West Georgia who
saw the big picture of how the entire state had to prosper together and there's evidence
of that all over the state, particularly all over metropolitan Atlanta for the good work
that he did.
We will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain after which we
will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the lady from the 107th House District
Representative Shelley Hutchinson, Representative Hutchinson.
Good morning colleagues.
Today it is a thrill to introduce my pastor today.
If you know me, and some of you do,
you know that I come from an extremely large Catholic family,
then I married into a larger Catholic family
And before I left Louisiana,
I thought it was a requirement to be Catholic.
I didn't know until Georgia that it wasn't.
So I've been in Georgia since 1993
and I have belonged to three churches since then.
And I loved all three.
I just felt like something was missing.
And I have a colleague, a mentor.
She was my graduate advisor at UGA.
Her name is Geraldine Jackson White.
She's probably watching, so this is a shout out to her.
She kept telling me, you've got to come to my church,
you've got to come to my church.
I'll lay the alerts downtown.
I live in Snellville, so I was like, you know,
it's a long drive, it's a Sunday morning.
But one day I went with my family,
and when I got there, it was Benye Sunday.
And I said, I hear you, Lord, I'm home.
So we had the best, and there are two things,
I do not eat outside of Louisiana,
gumbo, and beignets.
But our Lady of Lords, if you catch them on Beignets Sunday,
take, you know, count your lucky stars.
So let me tell you about our Lady of Lords.
Our Lady of Lords is the oldest African-American
Catholic church in Atlanta.
And in 2003, they erected the historical marker
honoring them for that.
Reverend Jeffrey Ott, who, by the way, went to the high school that's walking distance
from my high school in New Orleans.
He is a friar of the order of preachers known as Dominicans, serving as the pastor of
our Lady of Lords Catholic Church in Atlanta.
Father Ott also serves as board chair of Interfaith Community Initiatives, Incorporated,
a nonprofit which unites people to create lasting and transformative bonds to build a
more humane and equitable society. Father Jeffrey has served on leadership council for
the Southern Dominican province. Father Ot received the masters of arts and theology
and masters of divinity from Aquinas Institute of theology in St. Louis, Missouri.
he is that great. He deserves that welcome. He received the masses of arts and theology
and masses of vanity from a quietness institute of theology in St. Louis, Missouri before becoming
pastor of lords. While the arts served his alma mater Xavier University in Louisiana as
university chaplain, over the years he has developed a deep interest in the spirituality
of recovery and persons in recovery.
He enjoys travel, singing, and communing with family and friends.
Colleagues, I introduce to you, Father Jeffrey Atte.
Good morning.
Psalm 147 verse 12 says, Glorify the Lord, O Jerusalem, praise your God, O Zion.
For he has strengthened the bars of your gates.
He has blessed your children within you.
I like to begin my engagement with you this morning
with just a little few bars of an old song
that I'm sure a lot of you know,
so you're welcome to join in.
Just a closer walk with thee.
Grant it, Jesus is my plea.
Daily walking close to thee,
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.
I am weak but thou art strong.
Jesus, keep me from all hung.
I'll be satisfied as long as I walk.
Let me walk close to thee.
As Shelley said in her fine intro,
So I am the pastor of the first African-American Catholic Church here in Atlanta, founded
in 1912.
And so we are celebrating 100 and whatever do the math, 10, 11 years.
Math is not my forte.
And I bring you greetings from our church community which includes many fine folk like
Representative Hutchinson from throughout the Atlanta area and other parts of the state
and country since we have been celebrating our Sunday Mass live streamed to everyone.
And we are a growing church.
We are about to embark on a $10 million capital campaign to build a new church.
And so I bring you greetings from the hallowed grounds of our church campus where the neighborhood
children used to play, which included the illustrious Georgia Denison, the Reverend Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr.
And we're also proud to note in this women's history month that our founders, St.
Catherine Drexel, not only blessed us with her patronage, patronage, but also with her
holiness. As we continue celebrating women's history month, I chose that song just a closer
walk with thee because it was my grandmother's favorite song. And I wanted to honor her,
the woman who helped me to grow into my faith. And many was the day that I heard her singing
as she went about her chores and cooking. She didn't fail to let me know every time we
heard it in church, that's my favorite song. And so it conjures fond and loving memories
for me. And another reason I like that song is because it reminds me and all of us that
our relationship with Jesus, indeed our spiritual lives, is a day-to-day reality. And that's
true for all of us. Sometimes it's a moment-to-moment reality. Especially for those of us who
who are unemployed or working in the gig economy,
maybe our constituents, our parishioners, our staff,
people that we know, people that we don't know,
and those who face the shadows of death
with the coronavirus,
along with all of the healthcare workers on the front lines,
and all of those people know the day to day,
moment-to-moment reality of life. Now, if you're anything like me, you want the
quick fix. Thank God for Amazon. The magic pill, the reality of our spiritual
lives, though, is that they don't work that way. We don't get to take a pill and
have all of our problems melt away. In fact, an infinite wisdom, the creator of
the universe, the divine intelligence, somebody say divine, intelligence, the one who loves
us into being that mandates that we have a daily walk, a daily walk, that Jesus teaches
us that in the Lord's Prayer give us this day our daily bread.
My grandmother taught me that and she taught me that to be successful spiritually means
to surrender to the reality of our humanity, that we each live lives dependent upon one
another, that none of us is independent from the other, that we are interconnected, and
that's what our relationship with Jesus is all about.
We humans take steps literally and figuratively trusting in the divine presence and trusting
in one another. You know all about that, though, as representatives. You know all about the
importance of those relationships. And our prayer for you, I know certainly all of us at Lord's
pray for Representative Hutchinson and all of you, I commit us to praying for you. Our prayer
for you is that you understand more and more each day in your daily walk that we are here
to do good for one another, those that we know and especially those that we don't know.
The Jesus I serve, the one who calls us into being, the one who gives us life, who saves
us, was the one who taught us that we ought to do right by our fellow human, and that we
ought to lift up the good of everybody.
And we ought to do that because we have been lifted up, because we have been given the
opportunity to live and breathe and walk this day.
And so it's my prayer that you will walk in that way and walk in that spirit in all that
you say and in all that you do, especially for your constituents and the good people
of this state.
Please join me in a closing prayer.
Gracious Creator, we thank you for the gift of this day and we ask that you give us
a willing spirit to cooperate with your plan for us and for the good of all the people
of the state of Georgia.
And we humbly ask these and all other blessings in the spirit of unity and peace and let the
people say amen.
And now we'll lead in the pledge of allegiance, I pledge of allegiance to the flag of the
the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under
God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.
Doorkeepers will unlock the doors.
You

Audits. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Your Committee on Information and Audits has

furthermore, Mr. Speaker, when I was able to sit down there with Matt
dollar. He told me one time there in the middle of the week. Chairman Matt

morning order. The dean of this house, the Honorable Dean Calvin Smiley for a
morning order. Come on, you know, come on. This is on Speaker Murphy. So anybody, I tell you,
I, when Speaker Russell and I were talking other day, we were talking and, and we've talked
about Speaker Tom Murphy in the days, his birthday, he'd be 97 today. And I called Michael
Judge Murphy, as I told, the whip, I'm going to draw the whip, and then I was talking
to the leader of Beverly this morning, and I mean, the people said, you know the day
of Speaker Murphy's birthday, and I said, yeah, I said, I'm going to speak of Boston and
ask me to say a word, and I met Speaker Murphy 47 years ago, and I, and Speaker
Rossin has told this story to every freshman class in the last few years, and people say,
How did you get so close to speak of mercy?
And I said, well, in December 1974, I went to see him,
representing Albert Thompson, took me to see him.
He was the first African-American chair of a committee
here in the house.
And he said, son, he said, what can I do for you?
I said, my speaker, they told me I need to come see you
about my committee assignment.
He said, yeah, he said, what committee you want to be on?
I like to be on the preparations.
He laughed, he said, he said, appropriation.
He said, you're a freshman.
I said, yeah, but I'm only going to the bank of business.
I'm going to be on appropriation.
He said, not only will you not be on the committee,
you won't be in the room when we talking.
I said, okay.
He said, what's your next committee?
I said, ways of mean.
He's also son.
Who you've been talking to?
I said, he said, ways of means.
Another one of those, you won't be around when we talking
about ways of mean.
He said, what's your third committee?
I said, banks and banking, he said, oh my God, he said, son, I don't know who you've
been talking to, but I've never pointed a freshman to the banks and banking, and that's just
not heard of.
He said, but since it's your third choice, I'm going to point you to it.
He called a lady in and point, going to point this freshman to banks and banking.
And about, and you know how it is, Madam Chair, about two weeks later he saw me at an event.
He put his arms around me, he said, you know what, you and I are going to be all right.
He said, you keep your cards close to your chest.
And he said, I like you, he said, I'm going to put you on ways of means in four years and
you're going to be on appropriations in eight.
That's the best I can do.
And I went on, and I said, Mr. Speaker, what Bert told you, what did the Bert tell you?
The buyer told me that Banks and Banking
was your first choice and you gave it to me as your third.
And he said, that's pretty darn clever, young man.
So we became friends over the years.
And he was so pivotal in my career in the house.
And Speaker Marshall was a great person.
And I told him one desk, and the speaker got a load on.
I was chair of the Democratic Party of Georgia,
Chair of the Democratic Caucus on the House,
rules committed chairman, and on the budget conference
committee, four positions.
And everybody has one of those now.
As in the speak, you need to lighten the load.
I need to come off of one of them.
He said, let me say something to you.
He said, when I wake up in the morning,
I have two people to call, and you one of them.
I said, who's the other one?
He said, Terry Coleman, chairman of the Appropriation
Committee, he said, things are going all right.
But Tom Murphy was the longest servant speaker in the history.
He almost served 30 years at Speaker of the House, 30 years.
And he was a great man.
He was a great Georgian.
And I miss him dearly.
I call his son this morning.
And the speaker I know I went over my time,
but I want to thank you for our conversations
about our private conversation about Speaker Murphy.
And I want to thank you for your leadership
and remembering Speaker Murphy today on his 97 birthday.
And all of you all who served would speak of mercy
and know what I'm talking about.
And he was a great George and happy birthday.
Speak of mercy.
Thank you.
Some of you may have had an opportunity if you haven't, it's well worth the drive to
the Murphy Institute over at the University of West Georgia, where they have, they recreated
his office, and if you never had the opportunity or the, shall I say, the experience of going
in his office, it's well worth going over because I don't think he ever threw a coffee
mug away or a cap that he got in those 28 or 29 years. And they're all over
there in that office today. You get a real sense of him. Chair recognizes for
a morning order. Representatives LaHood, Chairman Corbett, Chairman Bershet and
and representative Sharper.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Members of the House, I rise this morning
on behalf of the Lounge County delegation
to recognize the VSU men's basketball team.
They won the first ever in team history,
our school history, a Gulf South conference title

The Chair of the Ways and Means Committee.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good morning, I'm here to thank this body for supporting HB593, providing much-needed
tax relief to our fellow Georgians in what is very challenging times.
The current pandemic has taught us at states that run a tight fiscal ship and leave as much
money as possible in the hands of their citizens are much more able to weather this crisis.
So I was a bit saddened and confused to learn the federal government's latest COVID relief
package, apparently bars states like ours from providing this kind of tax relief to our
citizens. So surely this is not true. I feel like maybe we misunderstood. So if someone
can explain this Washington math to me, it's concerning. But while I'm waiting for that,
I'd like to ensure the people of Georgia that this body remains dedicated to lowering
a tax burden on our fellow Georgians and on the farmers and small business owners who
formed the backbone of this economy. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
So if I understand this, the federal government is going to tell states they cannot reduce
the tax burden on their citizens. That's the way the language reads, sir.
Okay, just want to be clear.

Isn't it true, Mr. Speaker? Sometimes things take a minute to sink in with me.
And it just sunk in, is it not true that I heard a vote in favor of that bill in the U.S. House today
puts the tax cut we passed in this body by implementing an increase in a standard
adduction for all Georgians that file without automation, it would put that in jeopardy.
Yes vote on that package in the U.S. House day, isn't that true, Mr. Speaker?
I'm not sure since we had already acted, but I'm sure that if it is true, that our delegation
unanimously will oppose that.
Well, we would fight for our taxpayers, but he would put it, isn't it, true, that it
