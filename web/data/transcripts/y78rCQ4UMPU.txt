We will begin our day as is our custom with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, at which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the lady from the 53rd House District Representative Chair Lady Deborah Silcox. Thank you so much, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, I'm delighted this morning to introduce to you my minister, Dr. Richard Conwisher. The Reverend Dr. Richard Conwisher has served as the senior pastor of Peachtree Presbyterian Church since January of 2017. Before he arrived at Peachtree, Richard was lead pastor at St. Andrews Presbyterian Church in Newport Beach, California. He graduated cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in Business Administration from Trinity University in San Antonio, where he has served as a member of the Board of Trustees since 2006. He earned a master of divinity from Princeton Theological Seminary and a doctorate of administrative from Fuller's Theological Seminary. Richard has served as a trustee for both graduate institutions. In addition, he currently serves on the Board of Directors at the historic Fox Theatre here in Atlanta. Richard is a native Texan and is married to his wife Kelly. Kelly also has her master of divinity degree from Princeton, which is where the couple met. Rich and Kelly are the proud parents of their two teenage daughters, Danica and Ashby, one of whom is a bulldog now. Rich's other active and pursuits include running, swimming, and playing golf. So please welcome my minister, Dr. Richard Conwisher. Thank you, Deborah. Mr. Speaker, it's an honor to be with all of you today. My name is Richard Conwisher. I admit that that's kind of a very strange name. Richard is a term that means powerful ruler. And Conwisher, I kid you not, is a fancy German term for a dishwasher. So Reverend Whirlpool, Reverend dishwasher, any of that is how that I roll. And it's an honor to be with you today. I do often get, especially after introduced, asked, why in heaven's name did you move to Georgia from Newport Beach, California? It's because I didn't want to tell my god I chose the weather over the good work that needed to be done here. And so anyhow, we did live almost a decade in California. And while we were there, our children were in the sweet spot. We were 20 minutes away from Disneyland. And so they apparently keep count on this. I went to Disneyland 250 times over the course of a decade with our kids. And we learned a lot of trivia about Disneyland. And I want to share one of those before I pray with us this morning. And that is this. When they were building the jungle cruise ride, it was a part of an orchard of trees. And the designers went through and marked each of the trees that they wanted to keep with a green ribbon around the trunk. And the ones that they wanted removed with a red ribbon around the trunk. And then they told the person who was in charge of removing the trees to spend the time in the energy and the equipment to remove all of the trees that had been marked. After a couple of days, they noticed that it was being haphazardly done, that it wasn't following along the lines of the red and the green. And then they approached this construction worker. And they asked him why he wasn't following the instructions. And he admitted at that moment that he was red, green colorblind. All of that is to say to focus our prayer time today is this. We can have the greatest intentions in the world. We can have the greatest designs in the world. We can have the greatest strategies and plans in the world. But if we don't have our eyes open and we cannot see properly, we will not accomplish what we are supposed to do. And that one of the most common prayers of the Bible that needs to anchor us is the prayer to open our eyes. And so let us pray. Our gracious and heavenly Father, open our eyes to how fortunate we are this day. How blessed and honored to live in this state where freedom is still as abundant as the lush fields as supply our very food. Where our rich heritage was given to each and every one of us by those who more than self their country loved and mercy more than life. Open our eyes this morning, O God, with a gratitude that overcomes entitlement, a love that overtakes our apathy and a hope that overwhelms our despair. Give us a common faith that overshadows even our persistent skepticism. Invite us right now into a larger story. Give us a grander vision for our life together. Open our eyes, O God, that we may be as diligent today in our own work as the Ukrainian soldier standing at this moment to defend his city. Open our eyes that we may be as compassionate today as the nurse that is sitting with a child and Choa as she struggles with cancer. Open our eyes, may we only fear that our spirits will be too frail to meet the demands of tomorrow. Open our eyes that our own hearts may grow faint before the responsibilities of our own citizenship. May we only fear that our ideals may falter and seek shelter in the security of the past or the comfort of keeping things just as they are. And so make us both patient and vigilant. Open our eyes as you shower wisdom on these leaders to cripple the forces of hatred in our society, to improve the quality of education for our young, to enhance the safety of our streets, to empower business leaders and workers to deepen our resolve for what is true and noble and just and teach us to cherish the precious grace that is life and life with friends. And may what happens in this very chamber model that friendship. Strip away, remove our pride, remind us of the higher ground of our holy calling and the sacred trust that people have put in us as leaders. Open our eyes to the fact that we can't do this on our own. That we don't pause in this moment out of some sort of obligation or tradition or ceremony but out of desperation. This is our cry for help, O God. We know that we will not automatically rise to our dreams but that we will fall to the level of our commitment to you and to one another and so embolden us. May we serve those in need and be assigned not of our own agendas but of your greater kingdom coming on earth as it is in the skies. Match the quality of our speeches with the quality of our listening and teach us what it means to contribute to this state, simply to take from it or even worse just to sit around and complain about it. Open our eyes to carry with us into the future the courage that can only come from above to stand against evil and suffering armed only with the power of our own generosity. Call us to that rare burden of leadership still looking, still searching for a more peaceful kind and faithful people not only happy but humble and not only prosperous but good. And finally, O God, while we may come from different traditions and while we may hold a variety of convictions while our hearts or even our words diverge as I speak this prayer, I offer it in the only way that I know how. Through my Lord Jesus I pray and may all of the people say and reply. Amen and may it be so. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands when nation of the God indivisible with liberty and justice for all. I like to come up here. I'll get to see. Doorkeepers will unlock the doors and members may join the chaplain of the day in the south any room to have a photo if you'd like.

I know we talk a lot about health care workforce and those who are training our future physicians and PAs and nurse practitioners. We're fortunate here today to have a doctor of the day who actually does that day in and day out. He's taking a rare day off. Dr. David Falaul, we're glad to have him. He's the Chief Medical Information Officer at Augusta University in MCG, where we train so many of our physicians in the state. He's a board-certified internal medicine doctor. It means he can take care of all of us perfectly well. He's been part of the internal medicine residency program since 2013. He teaches practice management and economics as well. Originally, his BS in Biology and a BA in German from Wofford College in a Doctor of Medicine from the Medical College of Georgia, where he was class president as well. In addition, he's a crucial role in training our doctors of the future. And I'm just glad he's here with us today. Help me say thank you to him for being here actually after he has a couple of words. Thank you, members. Dr. Good to have you. All right. Thank you. Have a few words. Well, I just wanted to thank everyone. This is such an honor and a privilege to be here today. I know this is also the the start of of Georgia snow that's outside. The yellow stuff's out and about. So I'm here at Available. I also want to say thank you again also for the support of the Medical College of Georgia. That's where I did my training. And that's really where I found my passion to teach our future residents, our future physicians of the state of Georgia. So thank you again. Let's see. Now we have a South Georgia contingent here starting in the middle of the state, Chairman Dickie, Chairman Yerda, Representative Campbell, and Chairman Corbett, and Chairman Perkel. Man, Dean Green, Chairman Meeks. Thank you, Mr. Committee. This is the peanut caucus here. On your desk is the flyer tomorrow is peanut butter and jelly day. So get in line tomorrow. Those of you who are new have not had a grilled peanut butter and jelly sandwich. It is delicious. And this year by popular quest is made with peach jelly, believe it or not. So I, so I peanut industry is large and Joe Campbell here is going to represent if he's going to tell you a few words about a great peanut history. Thank you, Chairman Dickie. I spent a career in the peanut industry and I just a few facts to show our dominance on peanuts in the country and actually in the world. In the country Georgia grows 52% of the peanuts for the country. We usually are somewhere around 650,000 acres. The closest state to us would be Alabama around 200 to 20. And we have a high percentage of irrigating which gives us good quality. Excellent soil, but the main thing we've got is good peanut growers and we have good peanuts. So keep eating peanuts. Okay. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, I represent a minor is a really great drawer of peanuts and I really appreciate her being part of this caucus and I appreciate her farming background. Let's see. All right. He talked about PBJ day tomorrow, but for you new members, it's a great day to be at the Capitol. There'll be a great aroma of those PBJs being prepared. So be prepared to drink some cold milk and eat some peanut butter and jelly. It's a good day. Thank you members. Representative Roberts recognized for a morning order. Good morning, colleagues. We want to welcome the mom's demand action chapter of Georgia who is in the Capitol today. Mom's demand is the nation's largest grassroots volunteer network working to end gun violence. They campaign for new and stronger solutions to lack of gun laws and loopholes that jeopardize the safety of our families, educate policymakers and parents about the importance of secure firearm storage and work to create a culture of gun safety through partnerships with businesses, community organizations and influencers. They are driven by the knowledge that guns are the number one killer of our kids and teens, both in America and Georgia. We know that gun violence is preventable and they are committed to doing what it takes to keep families safe. And they, like my colleagues and I, cannot understand why our commissive gun safety bills are not getting hearing. They'll be here today talking to you because they want to be heard by their good leaders who I know you are all good leaders and you know that listening is a key component to being a good leader. Thank you. Thank you. Welcome to the People's House. Chairman Tyler Paul Smith for a morning order. Thank you. You're welcome without burst is not. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You know, Halston County is the first line of events against Alabama, but thankfully some of them were able to take time off of the front lines and come be with us for Halston County Day to cap with you all please stand rise. Welcome to the People's House. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. First line of the fest welcome, Harrison County. Representative Bentley has recognized for a morning order representative, Karen Bentley. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I really need you to listen carefully to this announcement. Today is Gifa Day at the Capitol George Environmental Finance Authority Day and they're having lunch in room 514 in the Coverdale. But also colleagues, please know that Gifa will be receiving or has already received federal funding that will be beneficial to all of our constituents. There's federal money coming from the federal government through Gifa, George Environmental Finance Authority, to our community action agencies across the state that will help our constituents weatherize their homes. So if you want to learn more about this funding, please go by room 514 today and meet with Gifa to learn about the weatherization funding that will help all of our constituents across the state of Georgia and share ladies, Lee and Smith is supporting Gifa as well. Thank you, I agree. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you ladies and those that heard that announcement can take advantage of it and those that didn't. There's more for the ones that go and that heard it. So that kind of worked out, didn't it? Their representative. That concludes our morning orders. We're ready to move on to the rules calendar. Ready to move on to the rules calendar. Let's see, that any room is full of the South any room, but the member any room is not. So these important conversations can either go out the front door or to the any room. We're ready to start on our rules calendar. We have a number of important issues to take up today, so we need your attention. Mr. Clark, will you read the caption to HB332-332? House Bill 332, by resident of parish, the 158th and others to be titled an act to amend chapter 13 to title 16, the fish to go to Georgia annotated relating to controlled substances. So to provide for certain provisions relating to schedule one, controlled substances, schedule four, controlled substances, and schedule five, controlled substances. Let's bill them refer to the committee on judiciary non-civil that committee recommends this bill do pass. Chairman Perry, she's recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ladies and gentlemen of the House House Bill 332, many of you that have been here before recognize this. This is just our annual drug update bill that we do each year. And it comes to us, it's requested by the Georgia Drugs and Narcotics Agency. In each year, the drugs and narcotic agency working with the GBI bring us an updated drug bill so that our state laws confer with or concur with the feds relating to controlled substances. This just allows our law enforcement agencies to be more effective and more efficiency and more efficient in doing their job. To best of my knowledge, there's no controversy over this bill. It's just simply a housekeeping bill that's done each year and I would certainly ask for your support. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I don't see any questions, but you wouldn't take you were not taking any any way so that worked out as well too. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill that Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill. The yeas were 164 the nays are zero. The bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. For what purpose does the gentleman from the 139th district rise chairman Smith? Mr. Speaker, make a motion. State your motion. I move that House bill 187 be recommitted to rules. The clerk will read the caption. House bill 187, I represent a member of the 123rd. No, this would be entitled to amend Article 4, Chapter 9 and Title 16 in the fish go to George Antietta, relieved Nefraud and related practices. On the gentleman's motion that HB 187 be withdrawn from the calendar and recommitted to the rules committee is their objection. Hearing none, it is so ordered. The clerk will read the caption to HB 84. House bill 84 by reps and a rose. The 124th and others to be titled and act to amend Chapter 1 and title 10 of the fish go to George Antietta, relieved the selling and other trade practices. So it's a reward for commercial financing disclosures. This bill then referred to committee on banks and banking. That committee recommends the dis bill do pass by committee substitute. Chairman Rhodes is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I have House bill 84 in front of us today. What this bill does is revenue based financing. This is a tool that is used by many medium, small to medium sized businesses. It's currently already out there. What we're trying to do is create transparency in guard rails for this industry. What this legislation does is it brings the total amount of funds provided, the total amount of funds dispersed, the total of payments, total dollar cost of financing and payments and prepayments. It puts all that that it has to be put in the disclosure and come to the forefront. Mr. Speaker, that's what the legislation does and I'll be glad to take a question. You have no questions, but if the gentleman has done a good job of explaining, so you have the question. Our yield is well. The gentleman is yielded the well. We do have a member who is signing up to speak. Chair recognizes we're part to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I appreciate the presentation of the chairman of Game Fish and Parks as well as the intent of this bill. But I rise to question two provisions in House

I've asked members on both sides of the offer clarification, but I haven't been able to obtain a clear answer. And so if members of this House share my concern and confusion, I encourage y'all to vote no, as it would seem this bill has not yet been perfected. If I may, I would direct members to lines 86 to 89. The bill states, quote, a provider's characterization of an accounts receivable purchase transaction as a purchase shall be conclusive that the accounts receivable purchase transaction is not alone or transaction for the use for variance or detention of money." As this bill pertains to money or financial instrument that I'm assuming can otherwise be quantifiable, I don't understand why this proposed bill allows a person's mere characterization to be conclusive or determinative that a certain transaction is not alone, even if there may be clear evidence or financial documentation to the contrary. Second, on lines 97 to 99, a disclosure must be provided for each commercial financing transaction that's consummated. However, quote, a disclosure is not required as a result of the modification for variance or change to a consummated commercial financing transaction. So again, why does this bill require only one initial disclosure and then explicitly preclude further disclosure and the event of change or modification to that financing transaction? Well, I'll be, this is certainly not my area of expertise, the plain meaning of these two provisions strike me as odd. Accordingly, I will yield for any answers to these questions if members can enlighten me. And if there are no answers to the questions that I'm asking of this body, I urge members to vote no and I will yield the well. Gentlemen, has a question if he would like to take him or he can yield the well, his preference. I'm happy to take a question, Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen, has a question to your right from Representative Ridley. Representative Jason Ridley to your right. Mr. Chairman, yield. Yes, sir. Okay, on your question on 86 through 89, the reason that this saying this is because this is not a collateral based loan like you usually get at a bank that we're all used to. Whenever you do accounts receivable, you're actually taking the interest in that business. So whenever you get it on just like when you get a car loan, you have a bill at the end of every month that you got to pay 300 is over five years, whatever. What this does is each product as it rolls out of percentage of that product goes toward the day. And so that's the reason that it's a little bit different than most where you don't have a collateral based in there. So you got to interest in the business until that loans paid off. Your other question about the disclosures. The gentleman have a question in there. I think it was at a start. Oh, well, I went through it. It's true. All this stuff that I'm saying. The other part of your concern is on the disclosure part. Whenever you do a regular loan, you have a truth in lending. Whether the federal government requires you to do that you have to fill out, you got an APR because you're doing a loan that way. So that's the reason disclosures are different. All basically this is a contract between you and the person that you're having that loan with that you'll pay back a percentage of that business until that loans paid off. So that's the difference in the disclosures also. I think Representative Ridley for enlightening on financial transactions. I think he's had one of those before, don't you? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. If one more question from your counterpart on the majority side. Happy to. We're chaired for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does gentleman yield happily? I appreciate you coming up here. And you know, as an attorney, I can appreciate us going line by line on these bills. And so I want to go back to where you took us in 86 to 89. And you mentioned you had an issue with the work inclusive. In the same testimony you gave, you said even if there is a contract to contradict it. Well, as a learned attorney, would that be conclusive? I think additional information regarding whether or not a loan is characterized a certain way would be helpful as opposed to the mere characterization. So would it be conclusive to you in plain English? Does a gentleman yield my apologies? Happily. So would it be conclusive to you if there was a contract to say otherwise? I don't think it would. Not when we're talking about financial transactions. So isn't it true? Does gentleman yield further? Yes. So if there is evidence to the contrary, then that would be conclusive then, right? Not necessarily. I think especially when we're talking about financial instruments. And in this instance, accounts receivable, certainly taking into consideration both characterization along with additional information would make sense in my mind. Especially if this is to ensure transparency for a new sort of financial product that we're bringing into the state of Georgia. Well, could we agree that it would be inconclusive if there was a contract to the contrary? Perhaps. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well, you don't have any more questions. I do think you shed some light on it. Both of you and everyone had the question and good answers. So, gentlemen, does not have any more questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The gentleman has yielded the well. We do have... Well, we're ready to move. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. The report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote. Yes, all those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of the bill, the yeas were 101, the nays 68. The bill having received your requisite Constitution majority is therefore passed. Clerk, will you read the caption to HB 306 306? House Bill 306, by the way, is in the flaming of the 114th and others to be entitled to amend Code Section 22506, the official code of Georgia Antietta, relating to definitions of authority to enter into multi-year leases, purchases, or lease purchase contracts. So it's to revise the definition of energy costs saving measures. Mr. Lambert, further committee on Governor Reynolds, fairs that committee recommends a disbilled due pass by committee substitute. Well, representative Fleming, you've had many years of service in this building, but is this the first time you've been to the well in the house? Yes. Welcome. Look forward to hearing your presentation. Representative Fleming is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and colleagues. I bring before you all this morning, House Bill 306, which pertains to performance contracts. Performance contracting is a budget neutral approach to make building and or facility improvements that reduce energy and water use to increase operational efficiencies. By partnering with an energy service company, local governments and state government can use these services to pay for today's facility upgrades with tomorrow's energy savings without having to tap into their capital budgets at the current time. So 306, that's three things. It aligns Title 20, Title 50. Performance contracting has been utilized in the state of Georgia for many years. She's the federal government, state governments and many local governments. Two, it provides that performance contracts can be based off revenue generation measures. And then three, it defines what the definition of what a facility is in code. This legislation adds revenue generation to the list of energy conservation measures that can be basis of energy performance contracts. State and county governments are unable to enter these energy performance contracts under Title 50 and then obviously school systems would be able to under this bill on Title 20. These are funding solutions for public agencies. Just a few examples that could be used for replacing water meters that would generate revenue from more accurate readings to as simple as installing new LED scoreboards and sporting facilities. And then they're able to sell advertisement space on those boards. And that's just a few examples and there's many, many other ways it could be used. And then it also defines the word facility, aligning a facility and Georgia code is not defined in aligns with what the federal code defines as a facility. And also this bill, all these contracts do have to go through the standard normal procurement process that is outlined by the state DOAS. So with that, Mr. Speaker, I would appreciate everybody's favorable consideration with the yes vote and I would yield for some questions. Well, I thought the gentleman done a pretty good job, but he has some questions. You take a question? Yes, Mr. Speaker. My representative. See if we can clarify some things here. Chairman Knight, to your right, has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Chairman, you. Yes, Mr. Chairman. And again, I want to make sure I'm clear on this because in a question it was in rules, but we talked about the example of the revenue, you know, in the bills to generate revenue. One of your examples was the scoreboard and the LED lights. But wouldn't you already be under the ability from a conservation perspective to do LED lights because it's a cost saving measure? You would. And what this does, this aligns Title 20 with Title 50 to be able to be allowed to do that. It's just clearing that up that you can do that and that you can use the revenue generated from these projects to help fund that project and other projects in that facility or building. Thank you. Representative Collins has a question. Is the gentleman. Yes, sir. I know in a previous version of this bill in committee, there was a clause in there that this bill could be effectuated without having a bidding process. And that's been removed from this piece of legislation. Yes, sir. This committee sub that we worked with through in the subcommittee and went through full committee. It did remove language pertaining to that. So now, like I said, it has to follow the normal procurement procedures and processes as far as going out for bid. That's correct. Well, do the follow-up, if I may. Yes, sir. Is there any kind of promise you could make to us if we pass this legislation, you won't put that back in across the hall over there? Yes, sir. Thank you. With that, Mr. Speaker, if there's no further questions, I'll yield the well. Well, you did have one more. Okay, I'll take one more, Mr. Speaker. Representative Clark to your left. Representative Jasmine Clark has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. So the two examples that you did provide to me, those sound like cost savings, which was already allowed for in the code. Can you provide an example of where one of these institutions would be generating revenue? Because they were already able to change to LED lights or to change their meter. So one more example that I can give is an example of EV charging stations that a facility could put out and they charge for that usage. And once they charge and it covers the cost of that project, it will continue to generate revenue that could be used for other upgrades and the facility purchasing more stations, stuff like that. Thank you. Yes, ma'am. Representative, I think this last question will bring complete clearly, clearty and brightness to this whole question here. So, yes. The gentleman from the 21st Representative Thomas to your right has a question. Thank you. Do you yield? Yes, sir. I'd just like to know, as everybody knows, this engineering day at the Capitol, can you please explain to me how this affects the industry across the state of Georgia? I don't think it would affect the engineering of the industry across the state of Georgia. All positive. All right. Thank you. You have no further questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. With that, I will yield the well and ask for a favorable yes, sir. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Is there any objection to agreeing to report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's done the report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine. All in the passage of the bill, the yeas were 170. The nays are one. The bill, having received a requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Congratulations. Good job. The clerk will read the caption to House Bill 396 House Bill 396 House Bill 396 by corruption of advance the 133rd to be entitled back to a men code section 12 3402. The bill is for the fiscal to Georgia and Tateau relaying creation membership compensation qualification accountability some assignment. So is to add the president of the Georgia College and state university, the Econy River Greenway authority. Mr. Bill, I refer to the committee on natural resources environment. That committee recommends the dispelled do pass. Representative, you've been around this capital for just hold just a moment. You've been around this capital for a few years too as well. But is this your first time in the well? Representative Ken Vance, for Millageville, is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Fellow representatives. This is a pretty innocuous bill. All it does is add the president of Georgia College and state university to the Econy River Greenway authority. This legislation was done in 2002 and that position was inadvertently left off and it took 20 odd years to get it back here. So I put that before you today and I'll be glad to answer any questions if there are any. Oh, yes, sir. You have a question. Gentlemen, you yield. Yes, sir. I yield. Chairman, we'd our to your right has a question. You yield. Yes, sir. This is about the Occony River, right? Do you know what county I reside in? That you reside in? Yes, sir. No, sir. Occony County. Do you further yield? Yes, sir. Did you ask me to sign this bill? No, sir. But the river is not in your county either. Yes, sir. Asked and answered. Yes, sir. I think, well, you do have another question. I don't know if this has to do with which county the river runs through, but it may have one of those questions. The gentleman from the 144th representative Washburn has a question. He's to your left. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Will the gentleman yield? Yes, sir. I will. Is it not true that you and I share the county of Jones in terms of representation here in the Georgia House representative? Yes, sir. It is. Will the gentleman yield for another question? Yes, sir. Does this river have anything to do with Jones County? No, unless you've got a boat and want to bring it over to Baldwin County and put it in down there at the Occony Greenway so you can go down the river. Thank you. Yes, sir. Mr. Speaker, no further questions. I yield. There is one more question to an old friend of yours. Former friend maybe after this question, I'm not sure, but Chairman Hitchens to your left has a question. Isn't it, isn't it, do you yield? Yes, sir. I yield. Isn't it true that we've known each other for many, many years? That we've done what together? No, each other for many years. Make it easy on yourself now. Yes, sir. And in your previous job, you bought a real vitality to your work effort. I've tried. And isn't it true that you've ridden your bicycle all over the state of Georgia and shouldn't have seen Vitality in doing that? Yes, sir. And one time, didn't you tell me you were going to ride it all the way from your house in Milletsville to Savannah and that you were going to be very enthusiastic about it and certainly wouldn't need any help? Yes, sir. And about 20 or 30 miles from Savannah, didn't you call me one day when you were out of gas in your bicycle and asked me if I could get you arrived for the rest of the way into Savannah? Yes, sir. I wasn't out of gas. I was out of leaks. And isn't it true that you're going to bring that same vitality to this organization? Yes, sir. But I won't run out of leaks. No further questions. Gentlemen, has no further questions. He's done an outstanding job of presenting your bill. I asked for your favorable support of House Bill 396. Thank you. Thank you, Representative. You stood the test. There's no doubt about that. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. The report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass, all in favor of the passage of the bill, will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? He's got legs. I have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of the bill, the yeas were 171, the nays 0. The bill, having received the requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Congratulations. You have all members voted. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 73. House Bill 73, by resident of Golo, to the 19th and others to be entitled to amend chapter 3, to the 46th, the official go to Georgia, and attendee relating to electric service, which was required the seller provider written disclosure statement within a agreement from sale of distributed energy generation systems. This bill have referred to committee on energy utilities and telecommunications. That committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. The gentleman from the 19th, representative Joseph Gullet, will present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today, I bring to you House Bill 73, it addresses bad actors in the residential solar space. I believe that every member of this chamber has constituents who have been ripped off by some of these out of state and fly by night companies. I believe that residential solar will continue to grow here in the state, and I believe this bill is an important step in that process. A little bit about the bill has got three components. First, it gives the PSC public service commission the ability to have to issue COAs, which are certificates of authority. The PCR already regulates energy and power in our state, and they are already receiving the complaints from bad actors. So I believe this is a right group to regulate this emerging market. Second, it requires a written disclosure to be given to the buyer or less e. This will include things like calculations used to determine total cost of the system, calculations on the cost savings, and whether or not you're purchasing or leasing the system, as well as who gets the tax credits from that system. And third, it requires the PSC work with the solar industry to create a solar awareness presentation that's on the PSC website. This would inform anyone wanting to learn about solar in the state, what the current laws are, the ongoing costs of maintenance associated with these systems, and another item is about whether it makes sense for solar for you and your home. Mr. Speaker, that's all this bill does. Again, I think it's really important to our constituents that this is into the success of the industry, and I'm happy to answer any questions if there are any. The gentleman has a couple of questions. If you'll take them, sure. Representative Clark has a question to your left for a representative Jasmine Clark. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield to you from my friend? So you referenced that there are some bad actors in the solar industry that have been harming constituents. I haven't heard anything from my constituents. So can you give me some examples of what these bad actors are doing? Because I'm genuinely not aware. Sure. Yeah. So I have a list here of Fox five investigations. I think there's like six or seven Fox five investigations. One says solar power has been chaos. One says hidden cameras reveal the dark side of solar power. One is about ways to avoid scams. One's about the PSC getting lit up with complaints about solar rip offs. One's about the public service commission calling attention to false root off solar ads. And so one's about he paid $82,000 for rooftop solar and that does not work. So in my in my case, one of my constituents has a trailer. It's about $52,000 on the tax digest. She was sold a $75,000 solar panel system. She does not speak English. The contract was in English. And they installed it on both the north and south sides of her trailer. So if you're familiar with you know, I know your scientists, you know, north is not good for solar, right? If you face it to the north, you're in trouble. And so her trailer is completely like this solar panel, like just, you know, all over the place. And then they are sold that's telling, hey, you won't be paying a power bill anymore. And in the day, sometimes these solar companies actually do pay your power bill for you for a year. So you have installed your power bills come back with a zero dollar, you know, bill, you feel good about it. And this company is gone. Your power bill actually comes in almost full price as it always has been. And so that's like an example in my district. I have, I think I've had 13 complaints in my district from my EMC in the last two years. So EMCs, me, eggs, those are all fighting this problem because a lot of times they come and sell the bad actors anyways. They come and sell like they're from the EMC. Hey, I'm with a work with Grace Stone, who's my MC. And we're doing solar around your area. And you know, we love to get you in on this. So that's one example for me. I know what's happening across across the state. Thank you. Thank you. Sure. Gentlemen, you owe for another question. I do or two. Representing Bentley is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman you I do represent it. Can you explain to me exactly how this bill affect the not the funeral industry this time. But Taylor County where my home county we have tons and miles and miles of solar panels. Sure. And I know there's an interest for a new company coming into my district. Several new companies coming into my district. So how would this bill going forward actually impact those new businesses that are trying to come into house district 150. Yeah, so in this thing this those businesses and I don't think that these are ones that apply this are installing solar on people's homes residential solar. It does not affect them. It doesn't affect any commercial installation of solar or the big solar solar farms are coming to Georgia. Representing a courier has to your left has a question. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman you I do for my friend. Is it not true that this bill would help just streamline the solar industry and representative. So many people ripped off by so that you also help to give back the this bill. Yeah, I completely agree with you. Thank you for that question. You have one last question. If you'll take it. I'll take it. Chairman Yerder right up in front of you right down the middle has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is gentleman you. Of course. Is it not true that we've had discussions about me witnessing bad acts? this bad actor is taking advantage of elderly people in my community. It is true. Thank you for bringing this bill. Thank you so much. I think that's a fact if you actually told you...

C's back home I think it's gonna apply to every single member in this body that there are some bad actors out there majority the industry is great But there's some bad actors and almost all of them don't actually they're not Georgia companies, and this is gonna help Help Georgia companies thrive in Georgia. That's what we want. So thank you mr. Speaker. I yield the well The gentleman has yielded the well We have another speaker that needs to be heard on this bill representing Roman is recognized to speak to the bill Thank you mr. Speaker Good morning colleagues when I was asked if I'm speaking for against this bill. I said it's complicated first I want to echo the need for consumer protections. This is bills like this are incredibly important to protect people from being scammed but in order to protect consumers this bill requires the CoA to be completed by the public service commission which is relatively unprecedented The PSE currently does not provide certificates of authority It's why sellers should instead register. I think through the Secretary of State like similar industries in Addition there is no funding in this bill for the CPSC to stand up an office that such a task requires Does this mean that in the future we could receive a request for funding once it becomes apparent the resources required for such a certification process We've seen the kind of resources as requires through the Secretary of State's office Our state government is experiencing intense challenges and high turnover Creating redundant offices will further strain that system. I Know I sound like a broken record to some of you But the process with which we implement these bills is just as important as writing them and in this particular situation We could see a negative unintended consequence This bill could prevent a growing sector from meeting its potential and It can hinder healthy competition and cripple in an industry before it has fully launched As a result of these unique reporting and certification requirements compared to similar industries We can become a clean Energy and electric vehicle leader while also protecting consumers Those mechanisms already exist and the PSE in my opinion is not the appropriate body for this for this reason I'll be voting no. Thank you for your time The lady has no questions Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield well the lady has yielded the well Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair here's none the previous question is ordered Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute?

Speaker. I'm pleased to present house bill 88 to the body this afternoon or morning This legislation named the Coleman Baker Act would help us with solving cold case homicides in Georgia and I'll get into some of the specifics of the legislation here momentarily But it is designed to help solve some of these unsolved homicides Supporting families who've had to deal with these cases and also getting those who commit these crimes off the streets It's named after ronda sue Coleman and Tara Louise Baker Ronda Coleman was an 18-year-old who was murdered in the in 1990 and Tara Baker was a UGA law student murdered in 2001 in Athens which is Is my interest in this legislation something that has it's a case that has brought a lot of attention the Special year of last year or two there's been a podcast that's been done related to this case and brought a lot of attention Last year the federal government and bipartisan fashion passed legislation On this matter to try to help solve some of these cold cases and this legislation would address some of our local and state agencies The policy goes behind the bill there's three one it would give family members of Cold case homicides and opportunity to have the case file reviewed six years after the death of the individual of their family member And if a new lead is found in the case that it could be re-investigated The second policy objective in the legislation is it Includes a reporting requirement right now. We really don't know how many cold cases there are in Georgia The GBI has about 500 cold cases. We don't know how many across individual agencies in Athens, Clark County There's 40 since 1972, but we don't have a statewide number on how many cold cases there are in Georgia And then finally this legislation clarifies it unsolved homicides and unsolved homicides that death certificates Can be issued with the generic homicide cause of death to ensure that individuals and families can have their their Receive a death certificate for their loved one This wasn't this was a situation in the Baker case where it took Several years to get the death certificate issued her identity was stolen multiple times as a result And so this just clarifies that corners will be able to issue a generic homicide as a cause of death Mr Speaker those are those are the policy goals behind the bill Believe this is a good measure that will help again solve some of these cases and make sure that we're getting those to commit these crimes off our streets Be happy to answer questions if there are any You know Gentlemen has no questions they may speak right yield the well and ask for body's favorable consideration We do have another speaker on the bill that we'll recognize represent Stacy Evans is recognized to speak to the bill representative Evans Thank you, Mr Speaker good morning colleagues.
