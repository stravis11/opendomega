TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good afternoon everybody. If you would please come in and have a seat then we'll call the
House Room Standing Committee to order and we're going to ask Dean Greene if he would open
us with order prayer please. Let us pray. Lord I God, merciful God and all
mighty Father in heaven. We beseech you, look upon us as your children and in spite of everything
all of us are allowed to be your children and to praise you for all the good you are doing.
And for all of us, as we come before you, in this place of democracy that we pray in your name
to bless us and guide us and direct us. And we're asking that you guide us all of those rough
and tumbling spots in our lives. And as we do the will of the people, we pray, or Father,
that we do this in your name.
And Father, we just ask you now that even in these hard
and serious times, that you may hold fast to each
and every one of us as we try to do that will bless us now,
Father.
God is in direct us in the coming days
and the Holy Name, we pray.
Amen.
Thank you, Dean Green.
At this time, we got a couple of items that are in the
committee we want to deal with and I'm going to recognize Chairman Lebritt who
chaired our subcommittee on lawsuit reform to speak to Senate Bill 69.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ladies and gentlemen, committee I'm presenting to you
Senate Bill 69 for your consideration. This is part of the governor's so-called
lawsuit reform or tort reform package. This is the bill that would regulate
litigation financing that is financing oh yeah I'm sorry the LC numbers
excuse me is LC 49 2382 EC at and I'm sorry that's the old one nevermind
hold on a second what is the yes 2385 S thank you that's the one that has all
the changes that I have marked on my drive so that I can explain them to you but
So the bill, what I said previously is still accurate.
The bill would regulate litigation financing
and would set up a regulatory infrastructure, if you will,
where out of the Department of Banking and Finance,
where they would be these entities
that provide the service of litigation financing,
which is defined in the code,
would have to register with the Department of Banking Finance.
They would have to disclose the department information
about who the principles in the company were.
and then there are certain prohibitions on certain actions and prohibitions on ownership by foreign adversaries.
There is also a requirement that they enter into written contracts with the folks to which they provide this kind of financing.
They have to have certain disclosures on it. There has to be a five day ride of recision or cancellation in the contract and there are certain penalties if they violate any of those provisions, one of which is the contract is not enforceable.
There are also provisions that allow for enforcement by the state,
involvement by the attorney general, and then an effective date.
Now, there are a few changes in this bill that were made in committee,
so it differs from what came over from the Senate.
There's a very finite number of them, and I thought I might just touch on those
if you've looked at the Senate bill and are just curious about the changes.
So one of the changes is in page five, in lines 112, the 115,
there was a requirement there that in order to register,
you had to put in, if you were a corporation,
you had to put in your articles and corporation specific language
about litigation financing.
That was stricken because at the time you apply
and form your corporation, you weren't registered.
And so it would not, it would be in the statement,
include those in the article. So it was sort of a, it was a nonsensical requirement. Nobody
could comply with it because of the sequence. You normally form the company and then you
would apply. So that, that was removed. Online one, I'm sorry, I'm still looking at my draft.
Page six, where there is a percentage stated about the middle of the page for entities of the
disclosure of people with an interest in the entity that was changed from 5 to 10% that
that's more 10% is a print and more standard in the banking world and banking
and finance have requested that. There is a prohibition about engaging in
litigation finance if you are a foreign person a principal or sovereign
wealth fund of a foreign adversary under 15 CFR section 7.4 that language was
clarified. The section 710-3 is brand new. That was requested by banking
finance and deals with denials of applications to be registered. So if your
request for a license is basically denied, that section deals with what it can
be denied based on and what the appeal process is if you feel that you've been
wrongfully denied. We also added some exceptions. There is a prohibition on
basically kickbacks. You can't have rebates or fees paid for signing up with
one of these financiers and there was a prohibition on that but it was so
broad it arguably would preclude them from paying their employees in their
sales agent so that we've added language to make that permitted. There was a
The prohibition on assignments, but we've narrowed that a little bit to clarify when that
can apply.
There's also a prohibition on someone providing services, having a financial interest in the
litigation, and that has been clarified.
It's services that are related to the litigation itself.
There also was an exception.
There's a provision on joint and several liability that basically says a litigation financier
have joined several liability if there are any kind of penalties or fees or sanctions imposed in
the underlying case that they financed and they put some limits on that that it would it would
have to be if the financing is 25,000 more in funds and if the right of repayment is fixed by
contract the liability won't exceed what they were going to be paid under the contract.
And then there was a word, there's an exception for regulated lenders and we took the word regulated
out so it would plot to any lender, as the facts are known, is the Aunt Sally exception.
And the effective date, well I'm sorry it was one other section, there's a section 7, 10,
10 would allow the banking department to use their existing sort of computer system for
lack of a better word in their existing licensing system for this licensing as well.
And then the effective date was changed.
I think it was going to be July 1, but banking finance said it may take us more than a couple
of months to get all this set up.
So it's been placed to January 1, 2026 for the bulk of the bill.
There is also a provision that provides litigation financing agreements can be discovered.
You can get discovery or you can find out about them in a lawsuit.
And that will be effective upon signature, so, but the rest of it in terms of what I view to be the primary for us and what most of the bill involves would not be effective till January 1, just giving Mike the finance and time to get all the set up and ready to go.
So that is the bill, Mr. Chairman.
You've heard the explanation to him a question.
Kim Williams.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And I'd like to chair him, however, you don't.
Absolutely fantastic job perfect in this Senate bill.
But the question, my question is I actually absolutely
agree that the Department of Banking and Finance
does a stellar job of licensing regulated financial entities
in Georgia.
But to that point, did they have adequate staff
in its main consideration of making sure that there's an appropriation, sufficient amount
of appropriations, headed that way to be able to allow them to do this job effectively.
No detriment to the other regulatory duties that they're all pretty much overstabbed with
already.
I have to confess, I do not know the answer to that question, but I would assume those
discussions have been had between the Governor's Office and that department to confirm that
because they did have input on the bill.
Mr. Chairman, thank you, and thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your work on this bill.
I did want to just call the committee's attention to lines 273 through 270, it's a long sentence.
Let's just go all the way to the end, 281.
You described the provision, which is this provision in the bill that will hold a funding company jointly and
separately liable for the conduct of an attorney in the case, or a person who is a party to the case.
You said they can be held liable in your presentation, but the wording of the bill says they shall be liable.
And so I guess what I'd like to understand, because I think that, and I'll say this in a second,
I'd like to understand why if a funding company abides by every single rule in this bill should it pass,
and they become a good business organization under the law, they do everything right,
including not participating or trying to influence the litigation, they can't control what the lawyer does in court,
Why are we going to force them to be liable for something they cannot control?
It seems to me that this is designed to just flat out discourage anyone
from ever becoming a litigation financier.
And I would like to know also if we couldn't just change the shall to may
upon a showing that they actually did something that should require them to be liable.
Well thank you for that question and I appreciate the lady correcting me.
You were corrected as a shall, it's mandatory.
So it does provide for mandatory joint and several liabilities if the financing is above that limit
and subject to the limitation that the joint and several liabilities would not exceed the amount of the financing.
I think you were calling for the benefit of the members of the full committee.
We did have some discussion on this and the lady who asked the question in my respect
very much proposed an amendment to change that and I know the lady does feel that is not
a good provision.
I would say as I mentioned the committee, I don't want to assume the policy but it would
seemed to me that the policy of this is that when the nature of these litigation financing
contracts, they are not like a conventional loan, and in essence, the litigation financiers
almost becoming a partner with the law firm on prosecuting lawsuit.
And so while they are prohibited from any kind of control, I think there's some concern
that the possibility of control might still be felt.
And effectively they are joining into a joint venture with a law firm on the litigation
and therefore they having them be jointly and separately liable will make sure they're
cautious and careful and do their due diligence about the matters in which they fund, which
I think has been a concern in the past is that the financiers get into the business of just
generating lawsuits to generate money regardless of the merit.
Now I suspect not everybody would agree with that characterization but I think that
that's been a concern in this space.
And so that is why I believe that particular policy
position was taken in the bill.
I understood, and one follow-up, Mr. Chairman,
I understand and have great respect for the Chairman
as the Chairman will knows,
and certainly understand the spirit of this bill.
It's a consumer protection bill,
and as I stated in committee,
I think there are lots of good things about this bill.
I guess just to state the response to the chairman's point,
how would a litigation financier be able to predict in the future if they've done
everything under this bill to make the right call and behave perfectly?
How are we going to then hold them yet to account for the conduct of the attorney
and the people who are in the case.
The litigation financiers are not parties,
they are not at the table,
they cannot give advice to the lawyer
about how to conduct the case as this bill is very clear.
So even if they're perfect,
they're going to be forced to shoulder
the responsibility of an attorney
who normally is the person who pays
when there is a finding of provolity
or in inappropriate conduct in the case,
I just would urge my colleagues respectfully
to reconsider that position.
I think it contradicts the spirit of the bill,
and you really just disincentivizes anyone,
even if they do everything right,
from being in this business.
Okay, was there another question?
Do you heagly do you have a, nope, you wife?
Okay, any other questions?
Okay, you've heard the explanation from Chairman Leveritt.
Do I have a motion?
Have a motion do pass by substitute in a second?
Is there any discussion before we vote?
Hearing no discussion, we'll put it to a vote.
Do pass by substitute.
that's LC492385S.
Yep.
Okay.
All right.
All those in favor say aye.
Any opposed?
No.
The eyes have it.
It carries.
Okay.
We have one other bill for us to be considered today.
Senator Caslan, come on up and talk to us
about Senate bill 255.
Thank you so much.
Chairman, members of the committee, this bill codifies the legislature's
investigatory powers. All legislative bodies, whether state or federal have an
implicit constitutional right to do their duties legislating, and to do that it
requires investigation of the facts and conditions circumstances that you're
trying to regulate or legislate. That's long established United States
constitutional law. In Georgia we also have a code section, it's section 45, 15, 17, and 19,
that specifically grants us that power of investigation and to issue subpoenas to accomplish
our purposes. That code section was directed at Attorney General and it gave the legislature
the same powers that the Attorney General has to investigate. In addition we of course will pass
resolutions either on the House side or the Senate side or joint resolutions that can create
specific investigatory committees and grant them through rule or resolution investigative powers.
In the course of chairing a committee that we've been looking into some activities of
district attorney, Bonnie Willis, in the Senate. This has been litigated. And the
Spirit Court in Fulton County has agreed that our legislature, both the House and
the Senate, have the power to subpoena witnesses to conduct investigations
within the scope of any resolution that might have created them. And they
upheld our powers on all grounds alleged. In the course of going through that
litigation it occurred to me that would be wise for us to codify this in a code
section under the General Assembly and that's what this does and that's title 28
bills with the General Assembly so it sets forth that both the Senate and the
House of Representatives can through their rules your general rules of
procedure or through resolutions can authorize one or more committees to
investigate certain subject matters and that's in the course of our legislative
duty. It specifies in this that that gives you the power to administer oaths and
have sworn testimony before these committees that you can compel the
attendance of witnesses through an issuance of a subpoena and you can
pel the production of books or documents or things through a subpoena for
the production of those documents and finally you could also require witness
to give us a deposition to members of the committee.
So these are powers that we already implicitly have
and the Senate granted our investigative committee
through resolution and it codifies them.
It is by camel in nature equal powers to the House
or the Senate if they were to exercise the right
to create such committee or to have a joint committee
to do that.
Interestingly, I went to NCSL annual summit this summer
and Louisville, and you know, they have all of those little seminars or sessions on different
areas.
One of them was titled, Everything You Need to Know About legislative subpoena pilot.
It's just like they've created it for me.
And I went and the legislators from every state were talking about how frequently they exercise
it.
They use different methods.
Some of them have standing investigative committees that are joint.
Many times they get, they told just a litany of case law where every state has upheld the
slagers powers to do investigations and subpoena witnesses and documents. In many of the cases
they told stories about where the push given take was between the legislative branch and
the executive branch. Some governors offices are not as open as ours and would not provide
the documentation or the data needed to form a budget. And so the legislative body would
ask for certain documents and financial records from different agencies to do it. But it
It was quite interesting that it's universally agreed, and I felt like it would be wise
for us to just put it in one code section, codify these powers that we really already
have, so that it would be useful for different legislatures going forward here.
There is a change in the committee sub one, was literally a typo of code section.
We had it mistakenly 45, 15, 9 and it should have been 19.
The other was that we just flipped the order of two paragraphs that was done between negotiations
between the speaker's office and the lieutenant governor's office.
Didn't change the wording.
Just did that and there was one little tweak where it said we can create an investigative
committee through a joint resolution or through joint rules of our legislative bodies.
Some legislatures just have it built in their rooms like standing commuters is what that was
referring to.
I hope I didn't take too long to talk about what's really a simple subject, but I'm
happy to answer any questions.
A couple of questions for you.
Leader Hugenie, I think there's a question.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, to the senator.
When this house becomes majority Democrat, what is going to stop us from investigating an
officer of the Senate?
This doesn't say you can investigate the other body, but you could form a special investigative committee and look into other matters.
Is that the intention? Is that going to be allowable?
Absolutely. You know, the voters rule, whatever party is in control.
And it may be, that way here, for too long, that there's one body, democratic and one Republican.
They could still work jointly, or they could have separate investigative committees.
Did I get your vote?
Okay, we're absolutely milling.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon, Mr. Senator.
Excuse me, just sort of a procedural question.
Oftentimes law enforcement, district attorney's offices, attorney general's offices,
services, who routinely use these types of tools to conduct investigation, have fairly
extensive standard operating procedures that govern them, that set guardrails and boundaries,
that hold them to account for how they use, and frankly to keep them from misusing this
extraordinary power. I would like to know do you anticipate there being some
level of time spent drafting some sort of standard operating procedure for both
chambers either body if we are going to to codify this which I you know I
don't disagree with the courts about the power just wondering if we are also
So going to give some thought about intended and unintended consequences and maybe draft some guard rails around how we use this power.
Yeah, that that is accurate and that's one reason we specifically say through joint resolutions or joint rules.
I think that would be the appropriate place to do that the other sort of guard rail as you mentioned is the resolution creating the investigative committee or whatever committee is that you give.
investigative powers. The any subpoena issued or witness is called by such a
body has to be within the scope of the authority granted to it. Okay, and then
so I guess would it be on a case-by-case basis so that the under what I think
you're anticipating here is that this is addressed per resolution as the
cases come that we then would define and decide what the guardrails are or
or would you be open to some sort of standing policy
that encourages best practices
and has a consistent guardrail for how we use this.
Just wondering your thoughts on that.
This contemplates that that could be done
and it may be done in the future.
This is something that may not be used for another decade.
It may not be utilized
If our current committee process is getting all the information we need voluntarily and for the large part, we are that but no, I would contemplate that we might have joint rules or resolution guardrails between the House and the Senate or each body might adopt their own to have parameters that resolutions, but you're protected because no committee can exercise these powers of less, there is a resolution from that body granting them this power, so it's going to take the majority of the House
a House committee and that resolution will say what your mandate, your limits of
jurisdiction or vice versa in the Senate or if they find it's something
necessary to have a joint committee which would be encouraged to build those rules
in. Thank you. Last question. You said it might be a decade before we use this
and I you also referenced the district attorney, Bonnie Lewis and
Poulting County. When was the last time or whenever has the General Assembly attempted
to codify or exercise its subpoena power that you're aware of aside from Madam District
Attorney, Fannie Willis?
I can't tell you the year but there is Georgia case law of a Georgia House committee that
had a similar type investigation of the activities of the member. It might have been the Senate.
maybe, but that was, let's say this much,
just my 19th year was before the end.
This is the first time in my tenure
that we've done it in the Senate.
And I don't think it's something that will be frequently used.
I think it will be a rare instance,
not like a standing committee doing it,
unless that's the little bit.
I did leave out one thing is,
so how do you enforce these subpoenas?
And it specifies in this bill that if you were to issue
subpoena and it was ignored or denied for some reason. You go to the superior court where
the witnesses being compelled to testify and ask them to enforce it through a motion for
contempt. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It probably was a
Senate member. Y'all investigate it way back. But thank you for work on this. And this
is just getting the weeds. I'm just trying to understand it. Line 15 says the Senate or
the House of Representatives made through rules of procedure or through a resolution,
authorized one more, one more committee to set chain of the exercises, the investigatory
powers. So when we pass our House rules each year, that could be written in our House
rules, right, the ethics committee can investigate or.
Just, just almost like where you create all the committees in the number of members, you
could create an investigative committee by your rules.
And if each legislative session, I mean, not by any will, and the follow up that so if they happen to absent the rules that became a compelling need and through resolution that we could do that, that it comes through the whole body, either will have to be and under either of those circumstances, if the rules have to be adopted by the body and a resolution would have to be adopted by the majority.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, to the Chairman and the well have three areas of questions, and I'm going to be fast, hopefully.
The first one is just sort of a nerdy, making sure we write good law, code question.
Since we've got 45-15-19, and that's referenced on line 20, I was wondering if there was any consideration for doing away with that.
way with that code section and just having this because it seems like we've got, we're
setting up a new code section but then we're referencing an old one and I was wondering
if that was, if there was a particular reason why we did it that way.
We wanted this to be additive cumulative to give, make it clear that this in no way
abrogates the prior authority by that statute.
In fact, if you look towards the end of this starting on lines 53 on, it makes it very
clear that the implementation of this would not be interpreted in any way to
advocate, modify or supersede or cancel out the existing powers that we have
both implicitly in the Constitution and in that existing code section.
This 45-15-19 is currently an interpretation of that is currently on appeal to
the Court of Appeals, is that right?
Not that I'm aware of.
I think you would probably agree with me, just the political climate everywhere, that
if one party is in charge of these investigatory committees, they're either party,
Democrat or Republican, you've got a chance for abuse.
And so I was wondering if you would be open to an amendment about making sure
sure that the committees were bipartisan, that we have a requirement that they be bipartisan
in relation to their numbers in each chamber.
I think that should be left each body to their own rules or resolution, how do they want
to handle that?
And we adopted rules of the Senate's best-invested committee, which by the way would unanimously
adopt it by partisan, every member of both Democrats and the public can agree to our rules,
they set forth, you know, who would serve on the committee the number of minority party
members that would be included. We built in that the minority leader would be and designated
members. So I think that's probably best left to each chamber to the side. And as you
all have pointed out, one might be Democratic one day and one Republican at the same time
and they both may have different ideals of how to go about it. I think I like that flexibility.
Well, wouldn't you agree, though, that if we put in some guardrails that said the membership
is always going to be commensurate with the numbers that we, number one, ensure that
they're always bipartisan, number two, we ensure that they don't get out of whack with at
least the wisdom of the voters that sent each of us here in our respective districts
and that, you know, to your point, would win, not if, one day I get to wear a majority
party badge, there wouldn't be bad behavior on our side to keep, to keep the then minority
party out of these committees. Don't you think it would be safer for everybody if we put
in some guardrails in that regard?
I think you might be starting with the presumption that the legislative function of coming up
with good policy by doing investigations is a partisan venture and I don't buy that.
You know, I think that what we ought to be doing is passing good laws.
In fact, my committee's task is not to in any way undermine any prosecution.
Its job is to find out ways to restore public confidence in the criminal justice system,
not weaponize the judicial branch to restore our faith by looking for legislation that we
can pass or amend to restore that confidence. So the committee is looking at some behavior
that is greatly undermined public confidence but not to prosecute or criticize that individual
but to find laws to make the guardrails as you're talking about what's appropriate prosecutorial
behavior so that our citizens will have more faith in that system. So I would think that's
just our example. There might be, it might be something we're looking at in, you know,
the price of gas or something. What's a good policy to do in that? That wouldn't really
be a partisan deal.
No, I agree. My point was just to make sure that we stay that way. My last question is
trying to understand, and I think you've answered a little bit, the purpose could be we could
have any number of purposes, but we would hope that any body or joint
combination of the bodies that authorizes one of these investigations has a
purpose is looking to find out something in order to do something about it.
If there is a problem as opposed to just airing dirty laundry, so I was
wondering if you would be open to having a subsection added that requires the
committee in any committee that's authorized to report out any findings,
conclusions or recommendations because otherwise we've just set up committees
to investigate and talk and perhaps embarrass but without any so what what are
we going to do we've investigated and then what yeah that I mean that's the
purpose it's to do our legislative funds to pass bills and to get the
information needed to give good logical sound decisions, create good public policy. Our committee
by its resolution does require such a report. What would we learn? What are our findings? What are
our suggested amendments or changes or creations of new laws? I don't have a problem with that at all.
I don't think that's necessary because I think it will be in any resolution that forms one of
these committees because that implicitly that's the reason for these is to assist us and
and the legislative function in the passing of the good laws.
So I don't mind if that was to be the will of this committee.
I don't think it's needed or mandatory
because I think that's inherent implicit
in the whole function.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Part.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I had a few questions as well along the lines
of those asked by my colleagues.
Senator Calcert certainly appreciate your intent
of what you're trying to do.
Now, I don't think, as you may have stated earlier,
that this bill is simply codifying or making a clearer
existing law.
My understanding with respect to the subpoena power
of legislators is that the Georgia Supreme Court has not
issued a ruling affirming or denying the power,
but it was a superior court that affirmed the Senate
committee's subpoena power specific to the circumstances
involving Madam District Attorney Willis.
They haven't, because it hasn't been appealed.
She apparently agrees with the ruling.
So the board has ordered or produced documents
and to provide a time to appear for that position
and they have agreed by the way to produce the document.
So there's not gonna be a need for that to be appealed.
But just so that we are all clear,
this legislation would be codifying explicitly
a new power would be that subpoena power.
not agreed. We already have that power. We have it in the code section and we have it in the
Constitution implicitly implicitly just like a judicial review. Constitution doesn't say
the Supreme Court can review our actions to see whether or not the Constitution of Marburg
versus Madison said hey this Constitution doesn't work unless you have that power or else we would
never have to follow the law. Nobody could host a countable. The Supreme Court has a series of cases
is that it's at the same thing.
Legislature has the power to investigate
so they can do their role as a legislative branch.
And then we have code sections as well
that allow that that weren't even necessary to start with
but they give us comfort.
And I just wanted to put it in the section
under the General Assembly so it would be clear.
And trust me, I am well aware of what's good for the goose,
what's good for the gander rule.
There is nothing in this that I wouldn't gladly
allow the minority party to exercise whenever they become the majority party again, if this
is equal handed for the institution of the legislature and let the politics shake out where
they might, the voters will decide what party they want to go.
So I would respectfully disagree with a few of the comments made.
One, I don't think voters would want to see more politically motivated partisan secret
investigations that this bill would likely permit.
I think with respect to ensuring the confidence of all voters, not just voters of one political
persuasion, one, we have elections that, you know, for example, with District Attorney
Fawney-Willis, she won her election with 80% of the vote.
I think if anything, that where voters have an opportunity to hold elected officials accountable
will instill trust as opposed to, again, partisan committees
with the power of subpoena that has no guardrails
as to the purpose or what they are investigating.
I would not want to see that as either a member
of the minority or the majority.
I think to the point that Representative Evans made,
I mean, is it unreasonable to have in this legislation guard
at least two tiers of guardrails, one that would limit
these sorts of investigations into, for example,
areas related to the misuse of government resources,
areas in which both Republicans and Democrats
can agree upon that the legislature
should have a subpoena power as opposed to, again,
allowing partisan committees, whether you're
in the majority or minority liberal conservative
to engage in politically motivated partisan investigations,
which again, this bill currently committed.
Okay, well, I gotta push back a little bit.
There is nothing secret about this at all.
We have the most open legislative process
in Georgia in the state.
I would imagine I'm on camera right now.
And if you're sitting at home on your computer,
you could watch and see what I say.
All of our committee rooms are broadcast,
live stream and they have to be announced 24 hours in advance. That's why we have
a agenda so the public will know what we're going to be discussing. Nothing
secret. There has not been a single committee meeting of the Senate
investigative committee that has not been live streamed and also televised for
that matter if the press was interested. So there's I reject anything that
this creates some kind of secret star chamber or somebody to do
investigations that are in the dark of night. That's not true. Do you want to add
something to this to create partisanship have at it. I mean, if that's a will of
this committee, this is not intended to be partisan in any way. It's the body, the
Senate or the House, if their rules and their resolution, their majority's
past, past what you own if you feel like you need to investigate. That's
where it's coming from, the heart, not some sneaky side attack. You're talking
about, you know, the funny Willis thing. Well, it was a judicial branch that ruled that
her conduct was inappropriate and made her be removed from that case. I clearly didn't do that.
Nobody here did that, but we heard about this appearance of impropriety that it's by the way been
upheld by the court of appeals. No legislative input here whatsoever. But when they started talking
about it. The question became, is it clear what behavior is inappropriate? That's
improper, you know, relationships or whatever, or use of special prosecutors. And
that's what we do. What we want to do here is let's pass bills and say this is
what we expect of our prosecutors to conduct. So that makes their lives easier in
the future as well. So they don't have to wait for the court of appeals to
the term on a case by case basis. That's that's where we're trying to get. So I hope I can put all any
partisan fears here that this is a weapon that's going to be used by the Republican Party or one day the Democratic Party
to attack people is to investigate into the legislative. So a few just a few comments to your response and then one final question. So
is it not true that Georgia sunshine logs do not apply to the state legislature?
that is true and I think with respect to you know the structures you know the
bicameral nature in which this bill would apply I think I would be a little
more comfortable had we you know had independent redistricting reform to ensure
that again voters have an opportunity to choose elected officials as opposed to
you know some of the gerryman who that again provides a partisan slant that then
allows a partisan committee under this legislation to proceed in a way that, again, they can proceed
in a politically motivated manner if they so want.
I trust and I understand your intent.
That is not what I'm assailing.
It's the potential effects and harmful unintended consequences that may result from this legislation.
Whether Democrats or Republicans are in the majority that I'm concerned about.
thing. Again, going back to guardrails, both us to scope of limitation, but can you speak
to guardrails with respect to separation of powers? Is there judicial oversight over these
investigations? Can you speak a little bit more to you?
As I mentioned earlier, if you get into the enforcement provisions of this, and that
this really blinds like 30 on page two.
What do you do if you issue a subpoena?
Here's back to separation policy.
Legislative branch issues a subpoena.
Does somebody in the executive branch
or somebody in private practice
that they wanna know what's going on
so they can solve a problem?
This is where the judicial branch steps in
because to enforce that subpoena,
you go to the superior court
where you're trying to compel the production
documents or the testimony, and that judicial branch then gets to determine whether it's
reasonable what you're seeking, whether it's justified by the law, by the scope of the
resolution for creating that committee.
And only if the judge says your subpoena was enforceable, the recipient did not have
just calls to do it, can they be compelled to comply?
So that's the best I can tell you as far as the separation of powers, it's implicit
But with respect to enforcement and holding folks in contempt, I certainly understand where
the court would be coming in.
At least my reading and additional concern is that this may be undermining the judiciary
and checks and balances with respect to, you know, whether certain subpoenas are treated
confidentially or not. You know, I'm looking at lines 44 to 52. If a court
states that confidential treatment is not warranted, would a partisan
committee be able to, you know, proceed? Yeah, if that separate branch of
government if the judicial system said, so that would come up if you asked for some
sensitive information. And the recipient of the subpoena said, I don't want to give this
up unless I can be told it and be kept confidential. And that's what this gives you the proper ability
if the subpoena issue or doesn't agree to hold a confidential, the judge can order you
to do that. I mean, that's a protection for people from having to disclose confidential
information in order to assist us to do our job. I mean, you're talking about the Judicial
Branch. Well, they ought to welcome our investigation. We just voted on my pay raise and we did that
after committee hearings being told by public comments, our judges are underpaid and we need
to pay a more to get good qualified people to do that. Well, what if they refuse to tell
us what their French benefits were and we couldn't, or with their retirement package in
some committee, said, well, by golly, we're going to order a subpoena so we can learn
this information. We would have the right to do that. We'd actually have the duty to
do that to properly legislate. So it's all this three-legged stool with the judicial
executive and legislative branch. This just makes it clear what our powers are and it
sets limitations on them. Okay, we've had some really good explanations and some really
good question. You got one more question to rack it up. Okay. Thank you, sir. So when all
of a sudden done, I appreciate your intent and where you're coming from with the bill
per your analysis and in which the subpoena power of a legislative body has been used maybe once
in 30 years, maybe not, maybe it won't be used for another decade, along with all of the potential
problems that this may cause, including, you know, undermining the trust that voters have
for us as legislators to be fair and to act in their best interests. I think, you know,
additional work may likely be needed on this. Again, just to ensure guardrails that
instills public confidence as opposed to potentially creating another tool for
politically motivated investigations. But thank you so much.
Okay, like I said, we've had good conversations and good questions, recognized Jim Hatchett.
At the appropriate time, I'd like move, do pass, SB 255, substitute LC 47, 368, 1S.
This would be the appropriate time, so the motion, is there a second?
second. Any conversation? All those in favor say aye. All those opposed say no.
Their eyes have it. Okay it passes. Mr. Chairman I had my button pushed to make an
amendment. If we're going to be a committee it seems like the members at least have
a chance to have discussion and amendment. We had already gone through all of these
and you'd had questions and several others too but I didn't know that you
wanted to make an amendment I'm sorry. Well that's why I pushed my button I don't
I don't know how else to be recognized in here.
I'll yell out next time.
That would be the preference.
That would be fine.
OK, thank you.
OK, that takes care of those two items.
Now we're going to adjourn the House Rules Standing Committee
and convene the Committee on Rules.
Got a couple of cleanup items we need to do here.
bit Leo pass out some documents to you there.
You
You
You
Okay, I've had a request to recommit Senate Bill 51 back to the committee on governmental
affairs.
I hear a motion.
Have a move in a second.
All those in favor say aye.
Any opposed?
Okay.
It's back in committee.
Senate Bill 9 was presented to the committee several days ago and it's on our
consideration calendar. I have a substitute to Senate Bill 9 and that's what
you should have there. It's the exact bill that we had with one exception. The
only changes are online on page 6 on lines 124 through 129 adding the
definition of person, the chance to look at that.
If you've had a chance to look at that, I'd like to entertain a motion that we do pass
by Substitute Senate Bill 9 with that one addition there.
Mr. Chairman.
Yes, ma'am.
I'd like to make a motion that we adopt LC 560401S as the rule substitute to SB 9.
Okay.
We have a motion and we have a second.
Is there any opposition?
Okay.
it's adopted then. Okay, now let's do this. Let's set a calendar for
rules calendar for tomorrow. That'll be Thursday, legislative day 36.
Okay, Senate Bill 9 is room substitute, the LC-56-0401S.
move in a second is in your position it's on Senate bill 63 have a move and second in your position
it's on Senate bill 72 moved and seconded in your position it's on Senate bill 85 moved and
seconded, any opposition? It's Senate bill 233, moved and seconded, any opposition?
It's okay. That sets our calendar for Thursday and we are adjourned. Thank you.
