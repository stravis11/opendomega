you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you all members return to the floor, please all members all members I hope you all had a filling lunch and didn't eat too much. I'll be watching you. I'll call you name if I see you dozing off. If somebody do the same for me, Sam. We'll move on to the rules calendar again. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to HB873. HB873. House Bill 873, members, and a governor of the eighth and others being titled an act to amend Title 15, the official code of Georgia annotated, relating the courts. So, should create a juvenile treatment court divisions, Ms. Bill Emmer, for the committee on juvenile justice, that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chairman Stan Gunther is recognized to present the bill. Chairman Gunther. Suspended just for a minute, Ms. Chairman. See if your mic's turned on down there. On the bottom, Ms. Chairman. That technology stuff, man. I know as a judge, you had somebody doing that for you. Yeah, I have a hard time with that now. Okay, House Bill 873 is, this bill brings juvenile treatment courts under the Council of Accountability Court Judges. CACJ is what I'm going to call it from here on. This legislation is needed to fully bring this court type under CACJ and provide the same support and oversight to the juvenile drug and mental health courts that exist for the other courts under CACJ umbrella. General drug and mental health courts are currently sponsored, I'm sorry, supported with state funds via competitive grant application, managed by the CACJ and the CACC. However, there is currently nothing in law that gives CACJ the ability to provide guidance to these courts or to mandate best practices. CACJ is seeking enabling legislation to officially authorize the agency to provide standards and best practices to collect data, to provide training, et cetera. The number of these courts has doubled over the past decade and the juvenile judges leading these courts are asking for the guidance and expertise that state standards certifications and peer review offer. There are also new national best practices that CACJ and the judges are seeking to bring to these courts. Every other Accountability Court type that is funded through CACJ has enabling legislation that provides the specific guidance. The agency is seeking to bring those same standards to the juvenile drug and mental health courts. There is no budget request at this time, but they anticipate asking for a person a new position in the FY26 to perform the certification and the peer reviews. And if you haven't been to a mental health court or drug court graduation, you ought to go and see one. You'll see what that's all about. It brings these people hope, brings them back into our society. And I'll stand for any questions. You do have a question. Representative Becky Evans to your left is recognized for a question. Does the gentleman yield? I yield. Yes, isn't it true that I serve on the Dicab Juvenile Justice Council and I definitely support this measure? Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Thank you. Gentlemen, you yield for another. I do. To your left right in front of you, Representative Al Williams is recognized for a question. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well, gentlemen, you yield. I yield. Is it not true that Liberty County had the second drug court in Southeast Georgia and it has been very, very successful? That is correct. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Gentlemen, you have one more. Yes, sir. Representative Kenner to your left has a question. Is the gentleman yield? I yield. Isn't it true that I recently attended two accountability court graduations and it is a powerful way for someone to redeem their life and get a second chance? Thank you for that. Yes, sir. Mr. Chairman, we appreciate how you, and your career have worked for the people of this state and the knowledge you have of how these courts work certainly is very important to us and thank you for the members for supporting this legislation. You have no further questions. Thank you. I yield the well. The gentleman has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none of the previous question. Is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? The Chair, here's none. The committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favourable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none of the report of the committee. Is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favour of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Representative Williams, good you. The other Williams is coming to the rescue. The other Williams is coming to the rescue. You're voted. Have all members voted. All members have voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of House Bill 873, the yeas are 152. The nays are zero. This bill will have received the requisite constitutional majority. Is there for past? Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 873? The bill is not for the passage of House Bill 909. House Bill 909 by the represent of Hagen and the 156 and others to be titled an act to amend chapter 3 of Title 35 with the official code of Georgia annotated relay in the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. So it's a revive for the restriction and seal of First offender act sentences until such statuses are revoked. The bill will be released on June 1st, 2021. The bill will be released on June 1st, 2021. The bill will be released on June 1st, 2021. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Representative Williams, I'm going to need you to wake up for this one. Colleagues, I have House Bill 909 for you for your consideration today. This bill would modernize Georgia's First Offender Act. First Offender Act was first enacted to prevent an isolated mistake from leading to a lifetime of barriers to employment. Housing or anything else that a person needs to do to be successful that requires a background check. This bill does not change who is eligible to receive a First Offender sentence. But what it does do is it changes the timing of the ceiling of records. Currently, records are restricted at sentencing, but they aren't sealed until the completion, the successful completion of a First Offender sentence. This bill would both restrict and seal those records at sentencing. The reason why I believe this is necessary at this point is that everything is online. So our court documents can be found online if a private background check company does a background check when someone goes to apply for a job, for housing and other things. So to restore the true intent of Georgia's First Offender Act, we need to be sealing these records at sentencing instead of at the completion of their sentence. G.C. I.C. dated that we pulled shows that only about 2% of those who receive a First Offender sentence do not successfully complete their sentence. So this has potential to help a lot of people.

Enter the workforce, stay there, find good housing for themselves and for their families. I would note that the Chambers of Commerce support this bill because of the positive impact it could have on workforce development. You've got a couple of letters on your desk from the Chambers of support. Mr. Speaker, that is the bill and unless I have any questions, I'd be happy to yield. You have a question if you'll yield. I will. You have a couple of questions. To your left, Chairman Parsons has a question. Thank you, Speaker, and lady Yill. I do. I was in a tree. First of all, I completely support what you're doing here. I think it's a great thing. I wanted to ask you said that the ceiling would happen at the time of sentencing. Yes. So I assume I don't assume, but does that mean that the ones that are already serving a probation or already been sentenced, that would not be part of them, is that correct? It applies to them in that if they've already completed successfully their sentence or if they're currently serving that sentence when they successfully complete, they could go to the judge and request the ceiling and that would happen automatically. Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate your work. Thank you. Lady Yill, for a couple more. Yes, sir. Representative Penich to your left and the back. Does the gentleman ask for a question? I'm sorry. Thank you. Does the gentleman lady Yill, I do? Is it not true that as a criminal defense lawyer, first offender treatment, is an invaluable tool to help people get back on their feet and support their family? I believe that it is. Thank you. Yes, thank you. Representative Gladney has recognized for a question to your left. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is General Lady Lille. You? I do. Is it not true that once this, your legislation passes and this is no longer a part of an individual's record, would this allow them to now serve in the United States Armed Forces? Well, that is a good question and I was to admit, I do not know the definite answer to that. I would assume that someone in here does. It does. It does. I have been assured that it does. All right. Thank you very much for this legislation. Thank you for your question. Yes, ma'am. That was great teamwork there, Representative. Would you yield for one more question? Sure, I will. Representative Kenner, do your left. How's the question? Mr. Lady Yield. I do. Isn't it true that Georgia was formed originally as a penal colony and prisoners would come here for a second chance? And does an HB909 certify us as that second chance state and don't we need to do more legislation like this? Yes. Thank you. Yes. Thank you. Ask an answer. Good question. Good answer. You have no further questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the will. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, has none the previous question is ordered? Is there an objection to adopting the committee substitute? Chair, has none the committee substitute is adopted? Is there an objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, has none the report of the committee is agreed to? Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? All members voted if so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 909. The yeas are 155, the nays are zero, the bill haven't received their requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. We had a couple of bills that we carried over yesterday. Mr. Clerk, would you read the caption to House Bill 10371037? I represent the Daniels of the 117th and others to be titled and act to amend Chapter 2A, a Title 31 of the official code of Georgia annotator relating to the Department of Public Health. So as we create the Georgia Commission, I'm eternal and infant health. This bill, I'm referring to the Committee on Public Health, that committee recommends that this bill do pass by Committee substitute. The representative Daniel is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and colleagues. Today I rise to present a very important bill for the people of Georgia, the women of Georgia and the babies of Georgia. I'm excited to do this today. It is House Bill 1037. Let me get this organized. All right, so first I want to explain what the bill does. It creates a commission on maternal and infant health in the state. That's the overview. There are 14 people on this commission. The governor is to appoint six of them. It will be an obstetrician, either a pediatrician or a neonatologist, a nurse midwife, either a family practice or general practice physician and a representative of a perinatal facility. And then the lieutenant governor has three members to appoint and the speaker of the house has three members to appoint. The DPH commissioner or his or her designee will also sit on the commission and a person from the research alliance will also be there as well. This commission shall meet at least four times per year and it is to solicit the views of perinatal facilities, providers, women in the state and determine the effectiveness of perinatal care in Georgia. It also will make available to the public the records of all of our meetings and what is discussed and make statewide policy recommendations based on the findings. There is a sunset clause on this from two years from now. So a detailed report will be provided by July 1st for the people of Georgia. Well, I guess it is actually June 30th and it repeals on July 1st if it is no longer needed. Now one of the things I want to say that we received questions and committee about this bill was what is the difference between this and the maternal mortality review committee that we already have. So the maternal mortality review committee examines women that have already died. What this commission aims to do is to examine the things that lead to those deaths. And I believe that that is very important. I also believe that we should be looking at infants because we have a high infant mortality rate. And so all of this to say this commission is going to allow us as policymakers to have a more holistic view of the issues in this arena. And it is also going to give us the ability to say to the women of Georgia that we hear you, we see you, and we are going, we care and we are going to do what we can to help you. And although we have put in place things for the last 10, 12 years, thanks to Chairwoman Cooper and the leadership of this house, we still have a ways to go. So this commission is not the beginning of the work that is going to be done on this issue, but it is actually an expansion of the work that has already been done. And so it is a very exciting day. And I believe I have some colleagues that are going to speak in favor of it as well. But I ask for your favorable consideration and we will take any questions if you have them. The lady has no questions. Wait, hold up. Can you, will you take a question, lady in the well? Okay. Will you take a question? Representative Buckner has a question to your left. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And does the lady yield? In your definition of perinatal, what do you anticipate that time frame being? Because that's not a definite time people usually have to define it. Do you know if it's going to be six months? Yes. So it is the time, the definition of perinatal is the immediate time before birth and then up to a year after birth to my understanding. Thank you. Thank you. Lady Yio for one more? Yes, sir. Because there are some speakers in favor but when you leave one more, remember to say Bennett to your left is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Would the general lady Yio? Yes, ma'am. Is it not true that I support mental health services for perinatal moms? Yes, ma'am. Thank you. You have no further questions. No further questions. Thank you. The lady has yielded well. Representative Park Cannon, you ready to represent Cannon? Is recognized to speak to the bill. Representative Cannon. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm here to speak in support of this bill for two reasons. One, given our statistics, collaboration is key right now. As many of you found out today, I am a Spanish speaking doula, I am certified and I am credentialed in the state of Georgia. And I can tell you that we need a safety net for birthing people. To anyone with concern about the term birthing people, I will point you to ACOG, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologist. They are the leading medical organization dedicated to the health of all individuals in need of gyno and obstetric care, to which the Board of Directors one year ago adopted the following policy. ACOG acknowledges the effect language has on individuals and populations. To be inclusive of women and all patients in need of OBGYN care, ACOG will move beyond the exclusive use of gendered language and definitions. This change includes integrating language that reflects the broad spectrum of gender identities into ACOG guidance, resources and communications in order to improve the quality of care for all patients, including those who identify as women and those who do not. This is also predicated on the Amicus brief, Doe vs. Abbott, since we talked about Texas today, maybe you will go back and look at that Amicus brief by the American Academy of Pediatrics and additional national and state medical and mental health organizations in support of the plaintiffs' application for temporary injection for a client in Texas who has denied gender affirming care. But back to Georgia. Within the United States, Georgia has one of the highest maternal mortality rates. In the world, the United States has the highest maternal mortality rate. That means Georgia is trailing the country and the world. I've been tracking this for the past seven and a half years of being here and the past three years have been alarming, which is why the women's caucus put together a letter to request the postpartum funding that many of you may remember was really a group effort. As of 2020, black women are three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related conditions. In 2021, the death rate in Georgia increased by 1.2 deaths per 1,000 inhabitants, which is a percentage point of 8.58. In 2022, the home birth rate in Georgia increased between 29% and 49% that is the highest home birth rate increase in the United States. In 2023, the hospital closure prevalence in Georgia became the third highest in the country. So today, I've listed here. It's a little difficult to see, but some providers that we should include beyond just OBGYNs. Those would be program administrators, newborn care specialists, infant nursery managers, dolas, OBGYN nurses, lactation consultants, pelvic floor specialists, labor nurses, maternity nurses, NICU nurses, NICU nurse assistants, midwives of all kinds, cardiology consultants, support counselors, prenatal nutrition counselors, logistics technicians, case managers, phlebotomists, patient care technicians, surgical technicians, nurse managers, audiologists, nurse practitioners, the list goes on and on. As you can see, this commission has an opportunity to include a wide variety of birth workers. Now to my second point of supporting this bill. This actually empowers state actors to do what they're already able to do, but I guess by providing them more directive, they might do it a little bit quicker. The first piece is to get private and federal funds to end to maternal mortality now. We can already do that, but it spells it out in this piece of legislation. Two, it'll give due consideration to recommendations of medical and scientific organizations in the field of parinatal care. Now this could mean that those people could sponsor a bill that creates a fund for surviving families of maternal mortality. They could sponsor a bill that reimburses birth centers at the same rate as hospitals. They could sponsor a bill that provides coverage of dual services to expect it and post part of people. They could sponsor a bill that enhances access to culture, competent quality care. They could sponsor a bill that provides for community health workers and use telehealth. You could have them reimbursed through Medicaid. You could sponsor a bill that provides trained birth workers on the ground and incentivize building a training to become a midwife. They could even sponsor a bill that incorporates father support or partner support in education. The list goes on and on. I will just finish by saying that I really believe the time is now to act on some of these policy recommendations that they have already given us that I just spoke to because this report won't be ready until 2026, the end of that year. Whereas we already know in the 2018 to 2020 report, we saw that there were over a total of 270 deaths and 89% of them were preventable. We know that time is ticking. So if we give two and a half more years, I'm really wondering how many more Georgians won't make it. So in the meantime, we can act on the study committee that was passed in 2019. Right now there were 19 recommendations as we've looked through and looked at the items that have been acted on. It's been 10 of them. There's still nine left and since we have two and a half years for this commission, I'm hopeful to see these following three included. One is to encourage continued research on racial disparity and social determinants of health that impact people who are pregnant in Georgia. There are two others, but for this time, I would just like to thank you for possibly supporting this legislation and to continue to think about burthing people as a term that is not gendered and that it actually helps, which is why ACOG has adopted it. Thank you. You're the well. The lady is you're the well represented, Kennerd. Speak in favor of the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I wanted to take a moment and give you a big poppy update, a big poppy status report. As of yesterday, my grandson Nathaniel turned 13 months old and see a picture of them right there. He's doing all the things. He's walking, running, climbing, smiling, laughing. He's got about 16th now, so he's eating. He's jabbering his head off. I have no idea what he's saying, but he clearly has a lot on his mind. With this past week, Alex and Nathaniel spent about nine glorious days with us and we had ourselves a time. I knew grandparenting was going to be great, but it exceeds expectations. He fills my heart with such joy and love, joy, and speakable. When Alex was carrying Nathaniel, she had a relatively healthy pregnancy, but she did have a couple of complications. Nathaniel was gestational hypertension, where her blood pressure was spiking. To the point that she had to be hospitalized three or four times during her term, and towards the end of the term it became a greater concern that they actually induced her and brought Nathaniel into this world a few weeks prematurely. What kind of deescalated the situation for us and gave us more peace of mind in addition to our faith was the fact that they had great healthcare insurance, which imported them at the best of prenatal and maternal care. She had all the facilities, all the hospitals, the doctors, the nurses, the OBGYNs. She had everything, all the infrastructure was in place to take care of any medical concerns. As you know, too many times, wealth and income determines a lot of our health outcomes. That's the way it is in Georgia. A lot of the pregnancy and maternal negatives that we're seeing amongst our mothers in Georgia is coming from low income mothers low income families. I'm hoping that this commission will look at the factors that address that and we bring more equity to our health outcomes so that every mom can have a wonderful and healthy pregnancy. Thank you. Oh, and for further poppy updates, please visit my Facebook page so that you can follow the poppy Nathaniel journey. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Gentlemen, as you do the well, they're a big poppy. Representing big poppy. Representative Glaze. Representative Lydia Gray, Glaze is recognized to speak in favor of the bill. Thank you so much, Mr. Speaker. I stand today in support of House Bill 1037. Thank you for my colleagues who robbed this bill. As I stand, I'm excited about the opportunity that we will create in this commission. This commission, we hope that will bring back information that will help us with legislation and appropriations. In the meantime, we will continue and need to continue to focus on this scourge and to make sure that mothers in the state of Georgia have our support in bringing their children into the world. I speak from my personal life experience as having two pregnancies that were high-risk. I'm a mother of two sets of twins. That is correct. And one, I was on bed rest the entire time from six weeks out trying to save my babies. The second one, we made it to 30 weeks. I don't want to tell you they're 31. And another set turned 35 last week. And I say that to thank those who are my advocates, Dr. LB Hastie, who was OB chair at South Fulton Hospital. I'm sorry to say that that hospital doesn't exist anymore. My four children are here in this state. They came back to this state after college and grad school to make their lives here. I'm honored as their mom that they would come back. I have a grandson that was born at 21 weeks. There is no medical plan for 21-week-old child. So we waited seven days praying every day. God, if he is to live, please let him live. He is eight years old. 25 surgeries later. I can't even count twice over in this summer we taught him to read two grandmothers. I say all that to say that this bill means a lot to me, but it means a lot to all of us. And all of us can take what we know to be pride in the work that we will do for mothers. We hope that there's not another 279 in the next four years. What I will ask you is that this commission that we're putting together, that we will not leave mothers out. Those who have survived high risk pregnancies, our voices need to be heard on the commission because there's no better person to tell you what they went through and what they've gone through and how they survived other than the survivor. So as I stand, having had those high risk pregnancies, and now have the highest joy of my four children back here in Georgia and my grandson eight years old kindergarten twice. But now I know how to read. Thank you so much for bringing this bill. I yield the well. And ladies, yielded the well. Representative Jasmine Clark has recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I rise in support of House Bill 1037. First I want to acknowledge the necessary, important and tremendous work of the Georgia Department of Public Health and the Maternal Mortality Review Committee. This report gave an eye opening account of the causes and contributing factors to maternal mortality, as well as making recommendations that could address Georgia's horrible maternal mortality rate and the disproportionate rate of pregnancy related deaths among black women. This report also outlined the six top causes of maternal death. Courage, mental health conditions, embolism, plea clampsia, anti-clampsia, cardiomyopathy, and cardiovascular and coronary conditions. For each of these causes, the report gave recommendations on how to address the contributing factors to each. For example, the report emphasized how management of chronic conditions prior to a person becoming pregnant and in between pregnancies is important for improving health outcomes in pregnancy and reducing maternal mortality. All together, this report laid on an important foundation for reducing maternal mortality rates in Georgia. Accordingly, the bill that we are debating today and that I am supporting today seems to seek to continue this work through recommendation of public policy that can improve maternal and infant mortality rates in our state. I do believe that it is incumbent upon us here in this August body to listen to the medical community who deals with these types of issues on a daily basis and can make scientifically sound policy recommendations based on medical consensus. I look forward to a commission that will recommend policy that extends beyond pregnancy both before and after pregnancy. And while I will be voting today with hope that this commission will add to and not just duplicate the tremendous work done by DPH with their MMRC and their report, I will also express a little concern that I normally have with any commission that has 100% partisan appointments. As of today, this commission will be appointed by 100% Republican men, which gives me some pause. But my vote today is that this will not be a partisan attempt at undermining efforts to addressing a true crisis in our state. Additionally, I hope that the appointees on this commission include not only health care administrators and health care providers, but also health care recipients. I think it is important to have the voices of the Georgians that will be directly impacted by the policies we propose and possibly implemented at that table. I also think that since mental health is one of the top causes from maternal mortality, but that there is no requirement that there be a perinatal mental health specialist on this commission that we should also ensure that that voice is at the table. I also think it is important that we have the voices of black women who are disproportionately affected by maternal mortality at the table. We have an opportunity to do something great here, and I am so excited to support it. And if we are going to do it, let's do it the right way. Lives in Georgia are depending on it. And with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Ladies, yield to the well. Representative Lepton is recognized to speak to the bill. Representative Karen Lepton. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, colleagues. I rise today in support of HB 1037. Many of my colleagues have spoken before me very eloquently of how we know what's happening in our state. We don't have to tell many people who are most in danger do not need to be told that there is an issue about this in the state. They know it because they live it. There are a lot of ways that we can attack this problem. When we attack the social determinants of health, such as poverty, such as housing instability, such as food instability, such as access to mental health, when we expand our scope and we take in the fight, we also affect those maternal mortality numbers because so much of what happens during a woman's pregnancy happens before she's even conceived. If we make women healthier in this state, our maternal mortality numbers will get better. Now it's been noted that we've had other studies, other working groups on this. This is great. It's been said that we can expand on the work that we have done so far. There are things that we can do to expand the scope of practice for midwives to help get lower cost medical technicians to some of our health care deserts. I'm really alarmed at how often the phrase health care deserts comes up when we speak about women's health. We can fully expand Medicaid. I know that's not a popular idea, but let me tell you what kind of difference that would make for the people who are impoverished in our state.

If we come up here and we persist, if we repeat ourselves, if we insist on bringing attention to this issue, it is in large part because we see ourselves in these numbers. We see women that we love in these numbers. We see our daughters, we see our nieces, we see our granddaughters, we see our aunts. You may come to understand our urgency when you consider the fact that four out of five maternal deaths are completely avoidable. I'm going to repeat that. Four out of five maternal deaths in this state are completely avoidable. We call for haste as we move to save as many lives as possible. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. The lady has shielded the well. We have one more speaker that's represented, represented Kimberly New, representative New. Thank you, Speaker. Members, I wrote it down because this is very personal. Last year we got here, very excited to be here. First week here found out that out of four grandchildren, all boys that I was going to have my first granddaughter, I was thrilled. Her birthday was going to be, next day, April 15th, which is actually my grandfather's birthday. The week of January 23rd, things changed. My daughter wasn't feeling well, she went to the doctor, they checked her out, she was okay, they sent her home. Two days later, she was swollen everywhere. She went to the ER, they checked her out, sent her home, said she, you're okay. Check in with your OBGYN. She did, thank God she did. She was able to see her OBGYN on Friday, who sent her straight to a specialist. They stuck her in the hospital immediately. She had pre-clampsia, no one that we could have seen. It had not shown up, it's fast moving, it's killing our kids, it's killing our daughters. Friday night my daughter and my granddaughter went into stress. There was an emergency surgery saved both of their lives. My granddaughter was born two pounds, seven ounces. She fit in the hand of my son. She was in the NICU for 83 days, struggling, fighting for her life. My daughter had to advocate for herself and for her baby. This shouldn't have had to happen. But thank God that she did. If we had had Georgia, maternal and infant health commission at that time, they could have helped. As soon as she had started getting these symptoms. I'm proud to say that my granddaughter just celebrated her first birthday. She weighs almost 20 pounds. And she's perfectly perfect. We need this commission to advocate for our daughters and our unborn babies. This is life changing prevention. I thank you so much for bringing this bipartisan bill. What a great way to work together for our children and our children's children. I yield the well. I'm going to ask a question for me. Yes, sir. What's that beautiful granddaughter's name? Her name is Riley Marie. That is her on the right when she was born. She was this big. Now she's a little fatty. She's right at 20 pounds and she loves to eat everything. I'm so thankful for it. She's beautiful. What a miracle. Thank you, sir. I yield the well. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair has none. The previous question is ordered. Is there an objection to adopting the committee substitute? Chair has none. The committee's substitute is adopted. Is there an objection to agreeing to the report of the committee? Which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The committee has none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the bill? Will vote yes. All those opposed? Will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Yes. Have all members voted? For what purpose is represented? Glad to hear us. Thank you, sir. Is it not true, parliamentarians are. Yes, ma'am. Is it not true that out of 159 counties, Richmond County ranks 103rd in quality of life, indicators of poor health, poor physical health, and low both rates. Above all the counties in this state and bringing this bill forth does, in fact, give us hope and something to look forward to in our county, sir. Thank you so much for bringing this bill. Is that? I'm sure if the ladies looked at the numbers and she knows that to be true. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Representative Jordan Ridley, for what purpose do you rise? Parliamentarian inquire. State's inquire. Is it not true a birthing person is, in fact, a woman as you need a vagina to give birth? Well, I'm sure the gentleman feels that to be true. Have all members voted if so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of House Bill 1037, the yeas are 160, the nays are zero. The bill having received your records at constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption to House Bill 1083? House Bill 1083, Barbara. Williamson of 112, the nenders to be entitled to amend Article 7 of Chapter 3, Title 37 of the Fisher-Coded Georgia Annotated Related Adult Residential Mental Health Services Licensing. So, as I extend, grace periods applicable to the Department of Community Health. This bill I refer to the Committee on Public Health, that committee recommends a disbilled due pass by Committee Substitute. Chairman Bruce Williamson is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. In 2022, this body passed a new Licensing Category for Adult Residential Mental Health Care Centers. We needed this license of your class for two reasons. Number one, up until this point, in the two-way past this legislation, they were being classified as personal care homes, which obviously made it necessary for the Department of Community to help the grant waivers to be able to administer drugs. The second problem and bigger financial problem was that a lot of insurance companies would not reimburse services because of the license of your category being under personal care homes. So, we passed the legislation to create this new license of your class. And as a result of that, the good intentions that came out of it, there's been a lot of interest expressed in being able to other mental health care providers coming into Georgia provide similar service drug and alcohol treatment services such as that. The Department has asked for an extension on the implementation for the rules and regulations for 12 months, update 18 months. And all parties are in agreement on this. Much needed extension because it was supposed to be in effect January 1st. They have granted some temporary provisional waivers for those folks that are already offering these mental health care services. So, just ask for the body's favorable consideration of extended the regulatory and provisional license dates. Have they happened to answer any questions or yield the well? You have no questions. Thank you, Mrs. Speaker. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered that Chair Here's None, their previous question is ordered, is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? Chair Here's None, the committee substitute is adopted, is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair Here's None, the report the committee is agreed to. Shout this bill now passed all in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted. All members voted if so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 1083, the yeas are 161, the nays are zero. The bill have received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Resolution 804? House Resolution 804 by Representative Markner, 49th and others, a resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution so it's the change that date by which temporary loans for counties, municipalities, and other political subdivisions. The other political subdivisions of the state are payable and full. Ms. Bill, I refer to the Committee on Judiciary, that committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chairman Martin is recognized to present the resolution. Thank you, Ms. Speaker. Let me explain first what this bill doesn't do or what this resolution doesn't do. This constitutional resolution does not amend the Constitution to allow local subdivisions to get more money or to in any way change the way they can offer these tax anticipation notes. What this proposition does is allow that note to be paid for over a 12-month period. Right now, it's arbitrarily due on December 31st. In cases where tax bills go out late in the year in October, November, and are not due until after December 31st, this doesn't do our school systems. In some cases, our cities and counties, but primarily school systems that get the most of their revenue from advalorant tax, it doesn't do them any good. Because they can't borrow money to pay these notes. Right? This is not a rotating or revolving credit line, and this resolution does not make it one. This simply says that this has to be paid back over a 12-month period. I call your attention to line 14 and line 16 and 17. There's a couple of changes on the back to reference that language, but what this does is simply allow our school systems the flexibility to borrow money for tax anticipation loans, or to be allowed for in the Constitution and pay that back over a one-year period, not the arbitrary date of December 31st. There's a speaker. It's that simple. I would answer any questions. It's an important measure, and is a constitutional resolution requires 120 votes. I'd answer any questions in order to align people, and hopefully we can move this forward. The gentleman has a few questions. Is he yield? Yes, sir. Representative Beesmore has recognized for a question right to your left. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Chair, for bringing this bill. And you know that we have had a situation in Fulton County where we had a problem with our bills going out on time, and then the money was not there to pay our staff for everyone. I would like to thank the senator for bringing this bill. I think the lady for a question, and again, Fulton County has brought this bill to us and has experiences. It really no fault of their own because of the unique set of circumstances. So this is good for all of the school systems around the state, but I thank the lady for the question. Thank you. Representative Holland, do you right has a question? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is the gentleman yield? Yes. Is it not true that many of us in Metro Atlanta received communications from our school districts today encouraging us to vote in favor of this bill? And I wanted to ask in case my colleagues had not seen their emails yet. Yes, and it's also true. I love it when a plan comes together in the school boards back legislation they asked for. Thank you. I thank the lady for the question. I think you'll plan that. You have no further questions. I yield the well and ask for the House Favourite Consideration on House Resolution 804. Chairman Martin has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair Hiznand, the previous question is ordered? Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution? Chair Hiznand, the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this resolution now be adopted? All in favour of the adoption of the resolution? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machine. All members voted. All members voted. All members voted. If so, the clerk will unlock the machine. All the adoption of the resolution. The yeas are 161. The nays are zero. The resolution heaven received your requisite constitutional majority is therefore adopted. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1162. House Bill 1162. The House Bill 1162, by the rep. 9 to the 134th to be entitled to amend. Title 4080. The official go to Georgia and it's a related to revenue and taxation. So it's to revise the terms internal revenue code and internal revenue code of 1986. And thereby incorporate certain provisions of the federal law into Georgia law. This bill haven't furthered the committee on ways and means that committee recommends this bill do pass. Chair recognizes chairman Knight to present the bill. Thank you Madam Speaker. About almost 20 years of doing this bill the IRC update. This is probably it is the shortest one that I've ever done. If you'll notice that the only changes here are moving the tax year into the year starting beginning on or after January 1, 23. You know for that fiscal year. The reason is as Congress has not passed any tax laws. So nothing has changed. We're just codifying for this past tax year. What is on what is at federal law. I will let you know that we have a vehicle out there. The 11.63 should Congress pass something before we get out of here in a timely manner. Such that if there are tax changes that should be passed we have a vehicle that we will try to get those own and through. But I wouldn't hold my breath as far as Congress making any new tax law in that time. So again shortest tax. Internal revenue code revision update that we've got. With that I'll stand for any questions. There are no questions. You do have one. The chair recognizes representative Clark. For questions. Oh she waves no questions. I'll ask you a favor because consideration of House Bill 1162. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered. The chair here is none the previous questions ordered. Is there an objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill. The chair here is none the report of the committee was agreed to.

On the passage of the bill the A's were 161 the A's were 0 the bill having received the requisite Constitution majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House bill 925 House bill 925 House bill 925. House bill 925 I wrote an abstinence of the 180th and others to be titled back to men article 1 in chapter 3 title 3080 the fiscal to Georgia annotated relating the general provisions relative to emergency management. So to prohibit any government governmental entity from discriminating against and closing a place of worship during an emergency. This bill I refer to the committee on public safety and Homeland Security that committee recommends that this bill do pass. The chair recognizes representative Sains to present the bill. Thank you Madam Speaker. Colleagues I bring before you House bill 925 known as the protecting religious assembly in states of emergency act. This bill simply ensures that places of worship are not unfairly targeted are discriminated against during states of emergency like we've seen across our nation unfortunately. I would like to extend before you and in saying Governor Camp in cognizant with how he treated our faith institutions ensuring that they had the ability to decide for themselves if they were going and how they were going to practice their religious beliefs has also heavily supported this piece of legislation for future circumstances. The bill explicitly prohibits any government entity from issuing orders or directives that would close churches or other places of worship in a manner that is more restrictive than the limitations imposed on other entities. In essence the bill simply makes them the most give them a most favored status in terms of operational restrictions during emergencies. Madam Speaker I know that the hours late after lunch and if there's no questions I will yield. You have one question. I yield. The chair recognizes representative Park for a question. Thank you Madam Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? I do. Is it not true that if this bill were the law that land back in 2020 that it would have undermined the ability of Governor Camp to protect the health and safety of Georgians? The governor has done a tremendous job not only protecting the health and safety of Georgians but the economic vitality of our communities and I agree with him on this bill that it's a good measure to have in place for future generations. Does the gentleman yield? One more question. Is it not true that in 2020 Governor Camp opened up our outdoor public parks in which if this bill again were the law of the land that would have also required indoor facilities such as places of worship to also be open despite the fact that it would have been a good measure for the future. There is a slight surprise to that I cannot think. He is just basics, asked, asked and this subgano fact to specific, then igcted continued because he was limited to promote public parks and we are husbands,Isn't lunch whether Friday evening evening evening evening. Is there a case it would be of time matter to leave out public parks before the Monday evening of his shelter? Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered the chair here is none the previous questions order Is there an objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill The chair here is none the report of the committee has agreed to show this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill will vote Yes all those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine I Have all members voted For what purpose does representative Roman rise Thank you parliamentary inquiry stature inquiry isn't not true that a big part of my opposition is because There is a concern that if God forbid there's some kind of attack or something this limits a leader's ability to respond to that and Help constituents forget what to do in that kind of an emergency The lady believes her position for what purpose does representative Clark rise Parliamentary in degree stature inquiry is it not true that the reason why I'm a no on this bill is because I do not believe that we should be taking tools Away from our leadership when there are times of an emergency where they have to be able to act and make good decisions Ladies clearly stated her position for what purpose does representative Hagen rise Parliamentary inquiry stature inquiry Isn't it true that if people can go to Walmart to buy groceries There's no logical reason why they shouldn't be able to go to their church to worship if they're leaders at that church deem it say for them Sure the lady believes of what she says in last Parliamentary inquiry what purpose does representative Cox rise Parliamentary inquiry stature inquiry Is it not true that as people of faith that the greatest place we could be in a moment of sickness?

I feel for any questions Here the chair recognizes representative cannon for a question Thank you madam speaker do you yield I do just have a question on the Credential duly registry right now we have a tracker that shows how many families we try to reach out to to get them prenatal or postpartum services and one of the highest numbers out of the 6,000 is 3000 people who have been unable to reach how do you think this bill addresses those rural families that we're trying to reach for Paranatal outcomes. Well, thank you for that question representative cannon the truth of the matter is when individuals don't have access to the internet Internet they don't have access to telehealth and also being able to contact Medical providers as well as education applying for jobs working from home There's a whole litany of things and I appreciate you bringing that point because I believe that it will be helpful in the future once we get the fiber in the ground and All Georgians have access to the internet that hopefully that number will will down substantially to zero You have another question the chair recognizes rep Minority web park for question. Thank you madam speaker. Does it generally to yield? I do is it not true that I greatly appreciate your bill and that Both at this piece of legislation was made possible by President Biden He signed into law both the bipartisan The bipartisan infrastructure act along with the American rescue plan. Well, I think you also for your question But much like Georgia's legislative body and governor nothing is possible without both bodies of the Congress so certainly There was a part with the signing but I think all the members from Georgia who did vote in favor of making this legislation possible As a general lady here for one more question. I did isn't not true that every single congressional Republican voted no to the American Rescue Plan Act of 2020

Thank you Madam Speaker. Fellow members, bring before you House bill 991 on behalf of the Department of Community Health which is the sunset extension on hospital provide or fee. It's a great upon method of the way we draw down medical funding for Georgia. Be happy to try to answer any questions if there are any Madam Speaker. If you have a question the chair recognizes representative Al for a question. Thank you. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, yes to do. Three very short questions. The first one is what is Georgia's current FMAP percentage? Is the federal medical assistance percentage? You ask it how much we draw down. Yes. It's about 900 million I believe. The overall whole in the budget would be roughly 2 billion. But 66% of the cost is what the federal contribution is. Second question is what would the federal contribution be if we availed ourselves of the federal funding available through the Affordable Care Act to fully expand Medicaid? I'm not sure I know the answer to that question. Not my expertise but you may. It would be more than 90%. So the last question is given 66% versus 90%. Would it not be a more fiscaly responsible and durable solution that we don't have to keep renewing this to fully expand Medicaid? I'm sure you probably believe that to be true. Thank you. Thank you. There are no more questions. Thank you. Madam Speaker, ask for your favorable consideration. You'll do well. Gentlemen, is yielded the well?

Thank you, Madam. Chair recognizes representative Roman for an afternoon order. Thank you, Madam Speaker. I am way too short. Colleagues, today I have the immense honor of sharing with you a little history for Black History Month. Specifically about one of the first Muslims in the United States was a Black Muslim named Bilali Muhammad. Bilali was brought to Saplow Island in Georgia as a slave. While some Muslims in the United States did not feel safe expressing their faith, Bilali found himself in a place where he could more freely express his religious convictions. He even built what some considered the first mosque in the continent. He also wrote a 13-page manuscript considered to be the first book of Islamic jurisprudence in America. It covers everyday essentials for a Muslim from prayer times to ablution rights. That manuscript continues to be an important and key document in Muslim history in the US. Muhammad's legacy continues today. His descendants make up the community of Hoghamic. In fact, some historians believe that Hoghamic is one of the last intact island-based Gullah Gita communities in America. Unfortunately, the community risks total displacement from the island. Many of the families have been forced to move off the island because of lack of infrastructure and schools. Local policies are also risking property taxes beyond what the few remaining families can afford. We need to do all that we can to protect this precious history and community. Thank you, Madam Speaker, I yield the well. Chair recognizes representative Williams for an afternoon order. Thank you, Madam Speaker. I rise to share a little known, like history fact, concerning a Georgia in 1952, Ralph Waldo, Quattroman organized one of the first NAACP chapters in Georgia. It was organized in Liberty County. He died before he died. He went to Ghana because he owned a sawmill in Midway. He went to Ghana to train the Ganyans how to operate sawmills. He died in 1964 at the young age of 46. We have the Liberty County Commission has unanimously allowed us to erect a statue to Ralph Quattroman in front of the courthouse in Heinzville. And it's the commission to do the sculpture, went to its sculpture on St. Simon's Island. Dave Pullen, when the statue is erected, it will be the first statue of an African American on a courthouse ground in the entire South. This is today's little known, like history fact. Chair recognizes representative Hutchinson for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mrs. Speaker. Happy Madigra. We like to say happy Madigra. We have King Cake in the Annie Room for me and representative in Eloise. So we're very homesick on this day. So hopefully you can celebrate with us. But today I come to you with another set of siblings for, or upward option. I'm sorry I've been off of my game, but I think I have the same illness that someone else had with Larry and Gytus. I'm just now getting over it. I wanted to tell you about this group of boys, Connor, Chase, and Elijah. They are handsome brothers who enjoy a close knit relationship and value being together. They're responsible and organized. They're also described as funny, empathetic, and caring. They do well in school and science is their collective favorite subject. Sibling groups like this are extremely difficult to adopt, especially ones with this range in ages. I appreciate it if you talk to anyone who was interested in adoption. And thank you so much for all the work that you've done in the last four years. And I yield the will. Thank you, Representative. The chair recognizes representatives Holly, Bell, and Bruce for an afternoon order. Members, please rise. Thank you, colleagues. Thank you, Miss Madame Speaker.

There's four years, two years, post-secondary, as important, y'all. In case of some of those, a teacher inspired us to become educators yourselves. I thank Mr. Brown from Lathonia High School. I'm proud of the work we've done under this gold dome support our teachers.
