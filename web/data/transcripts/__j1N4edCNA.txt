Okay, members of the House, members will take this seat, Mr. Clerk, if you'll ring the bell.
Members will please take your seats.
We stood in the recess, my favorite part of the school day was recess.
What about yours, my naughty little Beverly?
I know it was Representative Williams's favorite part of the day recess.
No doubt about that.
All members, please take your seats.
We have a little unfinished business.
We will attend to now and then we will have afternoon orders after we conclude this
this time, I will recognize Chairman Carson's for a motion.
Mr. Speaker, I move we agreed to the Senate substitute on House Bill 30.
Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to HB House Bill 30?
House Bill 30 by the Reps.
of Carson, the 46th administration of the 104th
panel to the 51st and others, to be entitled
back to amend chapter 1 and title 50.
The fish go to Georgia, annotated really
in the general provisions relative to state government,
so as a revive for the definition of anti-semitism.
Chairman Carson, you're recognized
to explain the Senate's substitute to House Bill 30.
Well folks, sometimes I didn't know if we were going to get here or not.
But what this bill does is very, very similar to what we pass in 2022.
We pass this bill in 2023.
And since that time, we've passed in this bill.
We've seen an unbelievably increase in anti-Semitic acts.
We've seen more leaflets in Dunwoody, Brookhaven, really
all over our state.
We've seen neo-Nazi demonstrations in my county and Cobb
County, also in Macon.
And folks, I hope you will just stand with me one more time
and say this activity has got to stop.
What this bill does is provide a definition
for anti-semitism such that when analyzing the intent
behind illegal discriminatory acts that target Jewish people,
whether it involves a hate crime or their illegal discrimination,
and there is an allegation that the action was
motivated by anti-Jewish sentiment,
the relevant authorities consider, as revutable evidence,
the world's most accepted definition of anti-semitism.
Many of you know I've been working on this bill for three years and I can
thank so many different people, Mr. Speaker, the American Jewish Committee, Atlanta
Israel Coalition, Israel, American Council, Hillells of Georgia, Hadassah, many of you
are in the gallery. And thank you so much for being here, folks. It's time to get
this done. I think the speaker said it very well, right, just before session,
whereas the speaker said certain things rise above politics. It is time to get
this done. It is time to stand up to the anti-Semitic acts. And again, people can
say whatever they want. You can see that in the bill that first amendment rights
of free speech are already are still protected. Folks, I want you to join with
me and show the nation who we are as Georgians and stand up to this anti-Semitic behavior
once and for all.
And on behalf of my friends in the Jewish community, I ask you to support House Bill 30 substitute
from the Senate.
And for what I hope is the last time on the anti-Semitism bill, I will soon yield a
well.
Mr. Speaker, we've debated this thoroughly, but I am happy to take a question or two on
this measure.
Thank you for your work and you do have a question or two.
Yes, sir.
I'll take a question.
I, to your, just straight in front of you, Chair Lady Silcox is recognized for a question.
Does the gentleman yield?
Yes, to my friend.
Isn't it true that especially in light of the attacks, the horrific attacks of October
7, 2023, that Jewish groups all across the state of Georgia have been crying out for
this legislation like never before?
That is absolutely true to my friend and my co-sponsor for this bill.
And many of those people that are crying out for it for that are here in the gallery
and in elsewhere and especially in your area of the state.
So thank you for your support.
Thank you for this legislation.
Gentlemen, you'll for another question.
Yes, sir.
I will.
To your left, Representative Becky Evans is recognized for a question.
Representative Evans.
Mr. General Maniel.
Yes, ma'am.
To my friend.
Yes.
Thank you.
Isn't it true that this definition of anti-Semitism that we are passing today is not codified
into our law, but it refers to the IRA definition that's listed separately.
So the definition is not codified in the law, is that true?
Well, it's referred to, just like we do with other definitions with regard to federal
healthcare programs, with regard to the National Insurance Commissioners with regard to the
American Forestry Association, there's many times that we in our state code refer to
a definition, but we don't subjugate our legislative authority.
We tie that definition to a certain date, just like we've done here.
Thank you.
Does the gentleman further you?
Yes, to my friend.
Thank you.
So, isn't it also true that this definition includes examples?
I think believe there are 15, 11 examples of anti-semitism.
Yes, ma'am.
Those 11 examples are part of the IRA definition.
That's true.
Isn't it true that seven of the 11 examples refer to criticisms of Israel?
If the general, if the general lady so states, but again, this protects free speech and it
is not, no one can be arrested and no one has ever been arrested.
That's one thing that has been stated in this capital.
No one has ever been arrested for speaking ill of Israel.
It's when that is combined with violence or discrimination.
Yes, thank you. I just have one final for this young one. You're for one more to my friend. Yes, I would
Isn't it true that many of us are concerned that the charge of anti-Semitism
Will be leveled against folks who speak out against the human rights abuses of Israel especially students and professors on college campuses
To my friend. I think we've talked about this numerous times
I hear what you're saying, but again, if you read the legislation, the First Amendment
is protected in regard to saying whatever you want, no matter how vile against the state
of Israel or its government or its people, it's when that is combined with acts of violence
or discrimination.
Thank you.
Gentlemen, are you here for another question?
Yes, sir, Mr. Speaker.
See, the gentleman from the 116th Representative Holley is recognized for a question to your left.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Does the gentleman you?
To my friend, yes.
So, I was curious.
If the IRA, do you agree that the IRA definition holds that the criticism of the state of Israel is also a...
It is also not allowed.
You know, we're getting so many questions about this.
I would refer many of you to lines 29 through 34,
which specifically state that nothing in this bill
should be construed to in French upon the First Amendment,
including our freedom of speech.
Do you further you?
Yes sir.
But if the Ira definition itself, as you, this is your bill, and you place this in here,
and if the Ira definition itself literally says that it literally conflates the criticism
of the political government of Israel with anti-Semitism, now I can grant it, you may
not necessarily want to say that on the microphone, but literally because you put this definition
any here, and this bill does support that, then this would not also literally stop average
citizens from exercising their first minute right to speak about the 30,000 Palestinian
civilians that are literally been killed in a genocide committed by the state of Israel.
Would this not stop them from being able to speak about that?
This would not stop.
And what I would further say to opponents, my friends that are opponents on this bill.
Please identify one person who has been arrested because of a similar statute in another state
or by the federal government's executive orders.
Please name me.
One person has been arrested or charged with anti-Semitism just based on speech.
It does not exist.
It was said on the Senate floor. There's 33 states that have passed this is actually about
37 states that have it either by executive order or and ten of those 37 by statute
People are not arrested for their speech. They're arrested for their discrimination and violence
My last question if you further you to my friend
Is it not true that we are silencing voters and interfaith groups who have made countless phone calls to the
representatives, demanding a ceasefire, and an end to the $3.8 billion of funding to
Israel's occupation force, when those funds would be better spent to support Georgia
teachers, Georgia hospitals, and the unhoused here in our state.
That is not true.
What I will tell you is true is that Georgia stands with our friends in the Jewish community.
I wish it did for Palestinians as well.
Thank you.
Jim, when you have a question,
you can state that during this time of question and answer.
That's what I'll expect you to do from now on.
Representative Panage is recognized for a question.
Does the gentleman yield?
To my friend, I absolutely do.
Thank you.
Is it not true that since October 7th,
there has been a 360% increase in crimes
or anti-Semitic incidents against the Jewish community.
I believe that is correct, yes.
Is it not, is the gentleman further yielded?
Yes, ma'am.
Is it not true that the Jewish population in the United States
only makes up about 2% of the population,
but it has about 60% of all hate crimes targeting them.
I, that is true, I believe it's a little bit over 60%.
Does it genuinely yield for one final question?
Yes.
Isn't it true?
Is it not true that this bill does not get applied
until there's an unlawful act or a crime,
an unlawful discrimination or a crime?
That is absolutely correct.
General lady knows what she speaks as usual.
Will a gentleman yield for one more question, maybe?
Yes, sir, Mr. Speaker, I will.
One question.
Right down in front of you, Majority Leader,
ifstration is recognized for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speakers, the gentleman you'll
to my leader, yes sir.
Mr. Chairman, isn't it true that has to the question
that was asked previously concern about the definition here
that this definition was actually incorporated
into a federal executive order as is referenced
here in this bill?
That is absolutely correct.
It was referenced to the executive order data December 11th, 2019.
Members, you can see that in the Senate's substitute lines 21 through 22, yes sir.
Is it not also true that as to the gentleman's question about
free speech that that's clearly addressed in the lines that you specifically read from?
There's nothing to infring upon free exercise of speech as enshrined in our constitution
in this bill. That is absolutely correct and just as a reminder that's lines 29 through 34.
I don't want to read it for the members but that's correct.
Mr. Chairman, isn't it true just as this House led in the passage of
Heycrumbs and passed the anti-Semitism measure last legislative session by
passing this today. We are clearly standing in support with the Jewish community
and acknowledging that an attack on a group because of their religion is an
attack on law and order and should be defined in Georgia law.
Absolutely, and I would go a bit further. Once that group is attacked, it is
is effectively an attack on all Georgians.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you.
Mr. Speaker, I'm sure there are other people
that wish to speak to this,
but on behalf of the Jewish community
and all my friends in their community,
you were not forgotten, you were protected.
Mr. Speaker, I yield the well.
Jim, I yield the well, and I'm sure
That you would like this to be thoroughly vetted, and as you know, it has already been
thoroughly vetted, so we will not be having other speakers on the bill.
That's our rules when it comes to agrees and disagrees.
At this time, we'll let everyone show exactly how they feel about this bill, about HB30.
All those in favor of House Bill, the Substitute, the House Bill 30, the Senate Substitute,
The old vote yes, those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines.
have do we do allow a parliamentary inquiry for what purpose does
the representing park can arise a parliamentary inquiry
state your inquiry is it not true that the more house chapter of the
American association of university professors
opposes this measure I'm sure if the lady says states I'm not for me
with that and further inquiry state your inquiry is it not true that
at Morehouse College stands on a proud tradition
of combating racism and anti-symmetism.
I'm sure the lady has on information.
Morehouse has not transmitted that information to me,
but I appreciate the lady's question.
For what purpose is representative Martin Ries?
Portal mentoring inquiry.
State your inquiry.
Mr. Speaker, isn't it true that in addition
to the lines on 29 and 30 that we adhere in this state
to the Constitution of the United States
and an article six paragraph to known as the supremacy clause.
Any law we pass in this state cannot stand superior
to the US Constitution, which guarantees free speech
to every American on any issue as long as the Constitution
stand isn't that true.
the supremacy clause is higher than state law in Georgia.
Mr. Chairman, I know you chair higher education.
I'm sure you've read that constitution several times.
So I'm sure your opinion is correct.
Thank you for stating that.
Gentlemen, from the 168th House District,
Representative L. Williams is recognized.
It's not recognized, I'm sorry.
Do you have, for what purpose do you rise?
But I wanted to make sure I recognize who you,
whom you are too, as well.
What do you rise to speak of parliamentary inquiry stated inquiry? Is it not true that I have
horror violence on either side in the current conflict? Violence against innocence in children?
Is that not so? I'm sure the gentleman has lived by that his life. Is that not further
true that I'm supporting this measure because having seen both sides of the
question, having also gone to jail with many of my Jewish friends doing the civil
rights movement, I've known most of them to protect human rights throughout this
country and I continue to stand with them is that not true? I can attest that is
true. You have been a hero. Thank you for your service to your community and
your beliefs. For what purpose does Ripley-Rumon rise? A few parliamentary
inquiries if I may. We'll see that goes. Let's hear the first one. Thank you
Mr. Speaker. My first parliamentary inquiry refers to the fact that is it not
true that this bill is different than the one that we passed last year that
that address some of the free speech concerns
that were presented to the spotty last year.
Repeat that.
Is it not true that this version of the bill
that we are voting on today is different
than the one that we voted on last year?
That's true.
This is a substitute and the gentleman explained it.
And is it further or not true that in this substitute,
it does not actually include the definition in the bill itself
instead it references a website.
I don't think that's exactly correct, but I'm sure that's the way the lady has read
the bill and that's her understanding of the bill.
Final primary inquiry is, is it not true that part of the reason that we made the amendments
that we did is to address the concerns about the examples on that website as it pertains
to the definition?
I'm sure there was an effort because as we all know we passed this bill last year and
There was a big effort to perfect it.
Some people thought, and certainly everyone in this house
had an opportunity to vote.
They're conscious on this bill,
as they're going to have that opportunity in just a moment.
Because I've just about had my last
proler meeting inquiry.
Let's see, we'll take a couple more.
What purpose is representing the COX rise?
Mr. Speaker, a parliamentary inquiry?
Stature inquiry.
Is it not true that after session last year
that my dear friend Rabbi Silverman in Cobb County
and their synagogue was hit with anti-Semitic threats
and aggression over in Cobb County.
I did see that in the news, yes I did.
I think that is true as the gentleman states.
Father inquiry.
State you inquiry.
Is it also not true that today in the state of Georgia,
we can make a stand for the people of Israel
the Jewish community by letting them know that they're safe here, they can go to school,
that they can live their lives and celebrate all that life gives them without the fear
of being harmed by what we're trying to pass this day.
I thank the gentleman believes everything he just said and we're going to give everyone
that opportunity right now.
We'll take two more polar-minute inquiries then we're going to be finished
For what purposes represent Campbell rise
Thank you, mr. Chairman polar mentoring query, please stage inquiry
Isn't not true
That as a body we wish for prevailing peace
Around the globe and in the Middle East I
I'm sure the lady believes, as she speaks.
And is it not true that in the spirit of unity, the reading of the actual definition of
anti-Semitism would have been a respected action that this body could have taken and could
still take?
I think the action before this body is on your desk, if you put your vote on the board
We'll see what you believe and what the member Mr. Chairman
One last probably inquiry
Representing Montahan. Thank you. Have something out here
Like you miss speaker parliamentary inquiry. State you inquiry
Mr. Speaker, isn't it true that the late
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once spoke on anti-Semitism and he said that
anti-Semitism, the hatred of the Jewish people has been and remains to be a
brought on the soul of mankind. I'm sure the gentleman believes that quote and
stands by that quote and lives by that quote.
have all members now cast your ballots. I think you have all members voted. If so, Mr.
Clerk, will you lock the machines?
Oh, the gentleman's motion. The yeas are 129. The nays are five. The House of
agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 30.
Congratulations.
I'm going to take this opportunity to remind every one of us that we have an obligation
put a vote on the board when we call a question. Mr. Clerk, will you read the House rule that addresses
any issue? Rule 133 when the question is put every member within the chamber shall vote unless
the member is immediately and particularly interested therein or unless the member is excused by the House.
It's my sincere hope that the members of this house will be thoroughly informed on every
matter that comes before us and then be willing to take a stand and vote their conscious
and their district on whatever issue it becomes for this house.
It's in the rules.
We need to live by the rules of this house.
Thank you, Mr. Clerk.
We'll move on to afternoon orders at this time, and we'll recognize, let's see, we also
have a time. We're in pretty good shape. We could stay here to dark, but let's
don't do that. So I'm going to hold y'all the three minutes. We're about halfway
to sunset. We're going to hold you to three minutes and it will be in force.
Representative Bennett and Representative Cummins have pretty neat afternoon
order. The ladies are recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
We have some folks leaving upstairs I think it may be appropriate to give that give them a chance to exit the gallery.
members will come back to order give your attention to the ladies that are about to enter
the well for the second time. Representative Bennett and Representative Cummings are recognized for an
afternoon order. Good afternoon. I'm representative baseball has been out sick this week. So we are here to
talk about an important event that she is having on Monday January the 29th district 69 high school
check-in day. In recent years the Georgia State Legislature has been moving toward improving
access to mental health resources in our state says representative Baysmore.
Legislations such as the Mental Health Parity Act establishes committees to study the mental
health crisis faced by our state and to give recommendations to the legislature on how
we can address this crisis.
So as we continue to address mental health issues, we cannot ignore one of the most valuable
segments of our citizens which is our youth.
So often, our youth do not receive the assistance or support that they need to navigate the emotional
traumas that they face each and every day.
So on Monday, January the 29th, Representative Baysmore will have attending at the Capitol
students from Bannocker High School and Fayette County High School, and they will advance
and learn about legislation, how legislation is passed, and NAMI will be here also along
with Dr. Sherry Blake, an expert in clinical psychology to address our youth.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and please stop by to say hi to the kids.
Thank you.
We feel the way out.
We hope Representative baseball continues to improve.
Larry Jackson.
Representative Jackson is recognized for and afternoon order.
Representative.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Colleagues.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Colleagues, I rise for a moment of silence.
I rise for a moment of silence because we're not trying to politicize an event that has hurt so many
George's, so many George's. This maternal health crisis is real. 169 women in Georgia die.
776 infants died to die in Georgia.
Yes maternal health deals with women, yes deals with children, yes this has nothing to do
with Republican Democrat. We were all affected directly and indirectly. And the women in Georgia
are asking us to do something because 169 of them died. Yes, we are passionate, Mr. Speaker.
because this impacts all families in Georgia.
Yes, we're passionate about women's health, women's rights.
Yes, because our citizens are asking us
in urban suburban and rural Georgia to do something
because they lost a loved one.
And since the beginning of this session,
We rise and gave a moment of silence because someone died.
It's not a political issue.
It's not a white, black issue.
Someone died 169 women, 776 infants.
So let us remember in a moment of silence
silence of those families that are impacted in this crisis of maternal health in Georgia.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
well.
Thank you Mr. Speaker, so this is my 10th year as a member of the House, it's the honor
of my life to serve in this body.
I think my most meaningful moment is each day when the chaplain of the day asks us to stand
together in unity.
And when we stand all is one together at this house, it doesn't matter your political party,
it doesn't matter what issue you maybe were debating arguing about ahead of time.
We all stand together and we all act together as one.
Now you know the issue of maternal mortality is something that obviously we all care deeply
about. We've heard members of both political parties talk about it. I served on a study
committee several years ago working on it. Chair Lady Cooper has worked tirelessly on
this issue. But we also recognize that we're a house family. And when there's a death
in our families, when there's a tragedy that occurs in our legislative districts, we
come to here, we come here to this well with a speaker's permission and we tell the membership
about it, and maybe it's involving someone you've never met, you've never heard of.
But you stand in respect, the entire house stands out of a show of respect to communicate
the fact that we are a house family, and that we are willing to stand together to express
condolences when it's deserved.
And as circumstance, where that, that unity that we all, I think, can take pride in because
is it transcends your political party,
it has nothing to do with what part of the state you're from
or standing together?
If that process is eroded and that process is changed,
I think that really hurts this institution.
I think if you've got something that you want to debate,
you feel passionately about your issue, great.
You all certainly know I feel that way about certain issues,
but I will never abuse the rules of the house
and your trust with you standing in unison
as we call for a moment of silence, request,
that you express condolences,
because I'm trying to get a score politically to do it.
And so I would ask respectfully for there to be decorum.
I want to thank the minority leader,
because he and I have spoken about this before,
and he is a gentleman and I think understands
and appreciates the importance of this within the house.
But my perspective is that we can all recognize
what we have and what we do here as special.
that should be protected, that should be respected,
and we can govern ourselves accordingly,
so that this isn't an issue for this house,
and you can tell I'm emotional over this,
so this isn't an issue for this house at all going forward.
Thank you.
I yield the well.
That is out of order.
Here's my comment.
Some many issues that we debate,
When we address in this house rise above politics, we have to put our emotions to the side.
This is an issue we can all all work together on to continue to make a difference, make
more of a difference than we've made up until this point.
This still work to be done.
We all know that.
I want to ask the members if you will.
this attention, this political attention to solving health solve the problem with a conversation
that addresses issues and not partisan back and forth.
This House has a reputation on leading on issues as it has done, not just for a reputation.
It is factual.
We've led on many issues, especially health care for Georgians over the years.
We will continue to do that if we do what we've been doing in the last few minutes.
We won't make progress.
And Georgians will suffer.
Georgians will suffer.
So let's do the right thing.
Let's put the politics in the back seat and let's work on the issue that's important to
all Georgians, all Georgians.
Several of those issues we would be addressing this session.
So I ask you to do just that and hope you'll work with me.
If you have a question on my statement on the two previous statements,
my office is open, come see me.
But we're going to refrain from this back and forth.
We're going to talk about policy and talk about solutions based on the facts.
Thank you.
Whip first shit is recognized for an afternoon order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Ladies and gentlemen, today on Suicide Prevention Day,
I wanna talk about a topic that is both sensitive
and crucial.
Every life is valuable and each one of us
play a role in creating a supportive community.
Groups like the American Society for Suicide Prevention
and its Georgia chapter do great work on this front.
That's why I'm honored to be carrying House Resolution 831 to commend their efforts.
But we must always remember that every one of us plays a part there.
Many people silently struggle with their mental health, and it's essential for us to foster
an environment where they feel safe to speak up.
Let's break the stigma surrounding mental health and the mental health issues and encourage
open conversation.
Listen to those around you with empathy, as sometimes a simple conversation can make
a world of difference.
Reach out to friends, family, and even acquaintances.
Let them know you care.
Small gestures can have a significant impact on someone's well-being.
Educate yourself about the warning signs of distress and mental health struggles, awareness
is powerful, a powerful tool in preventing suicide.
If you notice someone exhibiting signs of distress, don't hesitate to offer your support
and guide them through professional health.
Remember, it's okay not to have all the answers.
Encourage individuals to seek help from mental health professionals who are trained to provide
support that's needed.
Together, we can create a community where mental health is prioritized.
No one feels alone in their struggles.
And in my conclusion here, let's be compassionate,
understanding and proactive in addressing mental health
challenges.
By working together and including groups
like the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention
who was here earlier today, we can make significant impacts
preventing suicide and promoting the well-being
of all Jordan's around us.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I yield well.
Well said, very important issue.
Chairman LeHood is recognized for and after-norded, Mr. Chairman, give him just a minute.
Chairman LeHood.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
And members, as chairman of the House Government Affairs Committee, I'd like to draw your attention
to this flyer that was on your desk this morning. It may still be there and this is to announce
the Georgia Municipal Association's annual legislative networking and capital connections
breakfast at the Atlanta Hilton. And there will be a shuttle Monday morning to get you there
from the capital. It starts at I believe 630. Breakfast will be at 7 and we'd like to see all of you
there. Our speaker will be one of the featured speakers along with the governor and lieutenant
governor and there will be lots of mayor city councilman from all over the state. So hope
you'll join us. Thank you.
Thanks Mr. Chairman. That's a great event. Good folks from all over Georgia. No doubt.
Chairman Mac Jackson recognized for an afternoon order.
And friends.
him a speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, on Wednesday, January 17th, around 6.15 p.m., we had a
two-a-long fire at the landmark. Now I want to thank each and every one of you for calling
your concern, your kindness toward us that were affected at the landmark. This is the
the landmark caucus standing here.
Chevin Stevens is out.
He's a member of the landmark caucus too.
But the speaker even called and told me,
if I needed a place to stay, I could come over to his place
and stay.
Didn't call me.
Didn't call me.
Didn't call me.
Didn't call me.
Didn't call me.
But several people called.
Several you were concerned.
It was a serious fire.
and Representative McDonald has helped me
to get the fire department,
they'll be down here on Thursday of next week
so that we can thank them for job well done.
I've learned that in this house, you build relationships.
And I've got a friend that says,
in life, everything moves at the speed of relationships.
And Representative Al William called me yesterday,
I was at a funeral,
and he had found me another apartment to live in.
But building relationships is so important.
Representative Chairman Green has always been there
to give me advice.
My good friend, Representative Hewglick,
has always been there while we've been at the landmark.
But we are a caucus, and Chairman Green wants to say something.
You know, it was a devastating thing to come back
from a dinner and see your apartments on fire
and that you couldn't do anything about it.
and thank you to the Atlanta Fire Department.
And thank you to Penny Hausten,
who let me stay at her apartment in another bedroom.
And thank you, I had a shirt the next day and a tie,
and so I will get those back to the individual.
But thank you all so much.
Y'all are a loving and caring family.
God bless everyone of you, and thank you.
We're glad you guys are all okay representing Heagley. I do have a pull out
