in keeping in your thoughts and prayers today chairman Ron Stevens whose father is being buried today in terms of county chairman Bonnie Rich we hope we'll be back soon as and chairman Mandy Ballinger talked with chairman Ballinger yesterday and she's fighting the good fight let me sort of before we get going kind of tell you where we are we are we announced some measures Tuesday to hopefully that would be cautious measures for the health and safety of first of all the public and then members and staff and others since that time the reports have gotten a little well actually more than a little more concerning and we are at the present time sort of re-evaluating where we go here's where we will we will have crossover day and we will in all likelihood be here tomorrow members do not have to be here tomorrow except for me and the clerk and the messenger and general counsel because all we will do tomorrow is do first readers of the Senate bills no other action planned and I met with the governor early this morning I'm meeting with him again over the lunch break today and we're working together both with he and the Senate on the course of action that will be most conducive to the health and safety of members staff and the public and these are hard decisions to have to make see like whatever you decide somebody is going to take a poke at you but we're going to I think the best thing to do at this point in time is to err on the side of caution and if they want to criticize me for being too careful to guard the health of the people in this chamber then I will stand and plead guilty so I think everybody's kind of been the one mind and the accord of that we will keep you posted now let me let me one final thought I don't know if you all have noticed this but if you all ever noticed that there are rumors that float around this building I just found that out the other day and I promise you you can go out in the hall and you can pick out any lobbyist and they'll know more then all of us put together about what we're going to do well they don't they don't and so just we will give you the information when decisions are made and until that time no decisions are being made okay and so this business about you know all the speculation out there is just a it's totally unproductive actually it's harmful and in this case it's beyond harmful so we may even we may even have a session where we don't let lobbyists in the building and we can go home with our business how about that I think bipartisan support okay we will begin our day to day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 33rd House District I guess this will be his last chaplain chairman Tom McCall chairman McCall thank you miss Baker for letting me do the preacher of the day on the last crossover day and thank all of y'all for putting up with me for so long I appreciate it before I enter this gym his wife Amy and one of his main lay leaders are sitting in the balcony up there with Jane and we appreciate y'all braving the virus and coming Jim McCallum is a preacher at Methods Church and first Methods Church and the Hamilton has been a preacher for 24 years you graduate from Georgia State and Emory and that is about him but I want to talk about him for a second you know with all this virus and stuff going on and this crossover day and everybody's getting stressed out we thought we might ought to have a preacher from God's denomination which is the Methodist Church so anyway my seatmate shaking his head some about Jim he picks a guitar played bluegrass gospel music with my son who picks a band Joe he wears alligator boots and there's a difference between a preacher and a pastor and you know preacher can stand up on Sunday morning work about one day a week and got a big old book to go by but a pastor works seven days a week all day long all night long and while I don't go to the little church I go to have about 30 members my children go to his church and the difference between a pastor and a preacher and he is my pastor last year when I was having all this heart surgery stuff and you know they take you back down into bottom of the hospital and they got your stressed out and shaving you so you look like a three year old when they get through with you Ian walks Jim and I said hi in the world did you get way down here on the doctor's cat him come down here and he said all the way they know me I come down here a lot so that says a lot about him and the people he looks after so without anything else Jim McCullough hard to follow that guy in so speaker leader whip members and how Lord Jesus Christ I thank you for for an opportunity to be before you my wife said to me today Jim whatever you say please make sure you leave them with this and so I'm going to begin with that she said be genuine be sincere and then be seated please so so so Jesus is teaching and he does this a lot he's on a side of a mountain and maybe a group of folks like the folks we have right here they they lean in as he begins to teach and the most famous sermon that you'll ever hear and I want to read the verses from the gospel of Matthew the 5th chapter 14 verse Jesus is looking at him and he says you are the light of the world like a city on a hill that can't be hidden and he says that no one after after that light is lit no one goes and hides it under a bushel they they don't store it away they don't keep it for themselves but it gives light to all in the house could be this house couldn't it in the same way let your light so shine that your good works today on crossover day there's some good works may glorify not us but our father in heaven as I stand before you this morning I stand first before a holy and loving God a God of all people and great love and and I think about this light that he has given us the light of Christ but not just that the light of compassion and hope and as we stand here today or as I stand as your president the house today you will be the light for many others in this state and this country and in your communities Jesus says that there's only one force in this world that still has power to turn heads and that's when people give up their time they give up their resources they give up their position and life and in their in their communities so that they can be of service to others so they can love others compassion means if you in Latin you break that word apart it means to co suffer compassion is to co suffer and and so as we gather as the body on this day you'll have the opportunity to co suffer well who will you co suffer with well those that you represent in in the districts in which you serve those who have gone before you who sat 26 years before you got here Tom they sat in number 33 and they help prepare a place so that you could come and that you could serve and so that you could do that in this world it's the compassion and love of Christ that allows his light to shine in us and it's our willingness to allow him to let that light shine and so I guess my question for us this morning is we prepare to pray is how brightly is your light shining as you present on this final day the hard work and the all the conferencing and all the committee work how will your words partner with others who are suffering and struggling and how will you be that light in the world that will glorify our father in heaven the one who loves everyone I think this happens most whenever someone crosses an ethnic or cultural barrier I see it in my own life a generational barrier and they're willing to build bridges in our world filled with walls and moats and fences I see I see that a lot and then I see someone with a fluence freely give it away and allow someone who has no place at the table or no place in the room have a seat at the table and all of a sudden their voice is every bit as important as the voice of the one who received them and for that I thank you I thank you for your willingness to invite people to be part of a world Paul said it this way where they came together slave and free male and female Jew and Gentile that they were all brothers and sisters and yet he reconciled them to one another and they were kind and gracious for no one had ever seen a power like that in a world and as the the virus that's present right now I saw a lot of somebody gave me the shoulder speaker as I came in and I realized how we were sensitive to that which was spreading among us and that's good it's certainly not the virus but I want you to know that there's another virus at work and that's what he's talking about and it's the love of Jesus Christ and that should be contagious right I mean that should spread like wildfire that should go before us behind us with us and for that and when we do that our light so shines I want to invite you to join with me as we pray together Almighty God we can't thank you enough for each person in this house this morning but we have a nation today because generations of Americans have laid aside their personal needs and sacrificed their lives for the common good of this state and of our nation and we have a land of liberty today because ranks of patriots believed that there was more that I can do gather us into one community where the herding and hurtful are drawn together to love and to serve let us be strange to no one not the least for the greatest of these and then keep in your hearts the claims of the poor to be a part of community and your vision of one large colorful world where all are equal and equally important to you and remind us that the world was not made for us but we for the world where we pray over our congress men and women today they're calling the work before them as they legislate your handy work of light and love and forgiveness and compassion may they act justly love mercy and walk humbly with you God we offer this prayer for you and Jesus Christ I pray especially for those as we battle the those who may who are suffering from the virus and for those who are caring for those who are suffering God may you continue to work with those to bring healing to bring about that which will offer hope to those who do those who may be in its path we offer this prayer and Christ our Lord Amen I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God the individual with liberty and justice for all doorkeepers

And these extraordinary times also like to say to the governor, thank you for appropriating money in this budget. I know that our caucus sound the alarm a couple days ago when we were taking up this consideration. But we came together and we decided that this is the right thing to do. This coronavirus is a pandemic. We've never been through anything like this. And we're not sure what the outcome is going to be. But at a time like this is extremely important that we come together for the benefit of the members in this House and in the state of Georgia.

We have today with us the National African American Association, I'm sorry, the National African American Gun Association here with us celebrating February 22nd.

Chair recognizes representative Glanton for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I would ask that my colleagues in the military caucus of the House would join us this morning as we recognize two distinguished groups that are with us in the gallery this morning. This morning we have with us, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House, Cap Islanda, Kai, military fraternity, incorporated. As well as Kappa, Asylonside, military sorority incorporated. And Mr. Speaker, I want to let you know that we are extremely proud of not only your service to our country, but your service to communities around this great United States. We're also proud to know that you're moving your national headquarters, both the fraternity and its sorority to Atlanta, Georgia. And the Decatur Prepared. So thank you for that. Ladies and gentlemen, you have on your desk, you have some brochures that represent both the fraternity and the sorority. And we would ask that you would read those. And if you know of anybody that have served in the military regardless of whether they are active duty, reserved national guards, otherwise, to please look up these two organizations and become a part of these organizations. I would also like to say that these organizations will be down here in the annual to take pictures.

Thank you so much to our service to our communities and we salute you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I yield the well. Chair recognizes Chairman Cantrell for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I rise today to address the topic of sex trafficking. You say, why sex trafficking and why today? The connection between casinos and sex trafficking is undeniable. A simple Google search will reveal everything you know to confirm this fact. Research shows that sex trafficking and prostitution spikes around casinos. A study by UNLV's Gaming Research and Review Journal reveals that people who frequent casinos are 260% more likely to purchase sex. The John Jay College on Criminal Justice found that a large percentage of youth in the sex trade find their clients around the casinos in Atlantic City. Atlanta has been known as a hub for sex trafficking over the last several years. We at the General Assembly have done a lot of things to combat that and hopefully eliminated. Why would we invite casinos into our state now when we know that sex trafficking occurs around those facilities? Please stand with me if in any effort to combat casinos. We've had a lot of talk about the little guy standing up for the little guy and as a little guy, I like that analogy. This is your opportunity to stand up for the little guy. Let's stand together against casinos in Georgia. Thank you. We are out of time. We're out of time. Those who didn't get reached today, if you wish to be carried over to the next legislative day, please see the messenger. Chair recognizes representative Washburn to introduce the doctor of the day. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The lesson to the House is an honor for me today to introduce our doctor of the day. Dr. Steve Tuck. Dr. Tuck is the native of Dalton, Georgia. He received his undergraduate degree from the University of Alabama and his medical degree from Mercy University. He specializes in internal medicine. He's been practicing for 31 years. He's a partner of quantum healthcare and making Georgia where he resides with his family. I asked the doctor a few minutes ago how often he has performed this service for us. And with 31 years in practice, he has been here to be our doctor of the day 15 times, which is certainly commendable. And Dr. Tuck, we thank you for your dedicated service to us. Ladies and gentlemen, I introduce Dr. Steve Tuck, our doctor of the day. Thank you very much. I appreciate the hospitality I get every time I get to come up here. I appreciate all the hard work you do. And I know you all have a very busy day ahead of you. Good luck. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

you you you you you we're all members in the chamber we'll please take their seats the chair recognizes the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee for a motion I move that this House adopt the conference committee report on House Bill 792. Chairman England has moved that this House adopt the conference committee report on House Bill 792 that clerk will read the conference committee report. Committee of Conference Report on House Bill 792, the committee of Conference on House Bill 792 recommends that both the House of Representatives and the Senate received from their positions and that the Attach Committee of Conference substitute to House Bill 792 be adopted, respectfully submitted for the House of Representatives. Chair England representative of 116th District Jones, the 47th District, Burns the 159th District for the Senate, Hill of the 4th District, Miller of the 49th District, Dugan of the 30th District. The Chair recognizes Chairman England to explain the Committee of Conference Report for House Bill 792. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, you have in front of you a couple of documents. One is the actual bill with the cover sheet, sign cover sheet on the front, but you also have a very small document that is actually the change our agreement's document. And as you can see, there were not a whole lot of differences, but there are seven things that I want you to know about this bill since it left the House. One is there are very few changes. You can see that of a 211-page bill, there are only nine pages of differences, nearly all of which are adjustments in existing number or language that simply refine or change a little bit the House's position. The bill contains an increase in the revenue estimate of $100 million. An addition of the revenue, in addition from the revenue shortfall reserve fund, as the Governor had mentioned yesterday in his letter to us requesting for a change in the addition of the $100 million for the response to the coronavirus. That is reflected on page 2, the seventh item from the top of the bill, not the tracking sheet but of the bill itself. And then as well in the tracking sheet at 171.2 and the Governor's Emergency Fund is the authorized expenditure to specifically address any and all issues related to coronavirus and any required federal matches. Now my friend, the minority leader, he likes to talk about the foundation and it being shaken and I would tell him that I agree with him on this occasion that this is one of those times that the foundation is being shaken and that we do need to go into those emergency funds to use them for the purpose of which it is there for and this time is now. The bill also includes a $5 million ad for rural hospitals to aid in their preparations as well and the restoration of full funding to grant aid to all county health departments. Also you'll notice that all fees for purposes that have been specifically designated are reflected in House Bill 792 as well. Things such as the Solid Waste Trust Fund, Hazardous Waste Trust Fund, the Provider Fee's and so on. House Bill 792 also fully funds QBE and provides $132.8 million additional dollars to the Department of Education to provide for the midterm enrollment growth adjustment are the addition of 6193 additional students in our school systems across the state. It includes the additional funds for charter system grants, special needs scholarship and the state commission charter school's supplements. The Senate completely agreed with the House that the three state schools that provided the direct education of hearing our visually impaired students should be funded as well and should not have been cut and be exempted just as QBE had been as well. The Senate also agreed to fully restore the 1.3 million reduction that had been proposed to public libraries and to the Georgia Archives. We maintain the House position on behavioral health with an addition of $8.2 million in new access to services and treatment capacity for over 2,300 more Georgia's and native crisis treatment. In support of our number one industry in this state, House Bill 792 as it left the house has $3.1 million for extension positions in programming, $25 million for forest land protection grants and the funding for the Georgia Grown brand and its marketing both nationally and internationally. Criminal Justice Reform is upheld by both chambers throughout this full restoration of $4 million in proposed reductions to juvenile justice and incentive grants, accountability courts, and fully funding the payrolls of public defenders in every county and as well, excuse me, the House position maintains 8 scientists and 2 lab technicians at GBI for the timely processing of evidence and especially rape kits. I'm certain that the $100 million in reserve funding for the protection of our citizens health requested by the Governor and granted by the General Assembly will be a topic of week, four weeks to come. However, I urge you not to lose sight of the incredibly important function supported in the long-term view of House Bill 792 and I do urge your favorable consideration. Mr. Speaker, I'll be glad to take a couple of questions if there are any otherwise. I would ask my colleagues to please support House Bill 792 Conference Committee Report. You do not appear to have any questions. That being the case. I'm sorry you do have a question. All right in there. Do you yield? Yes, sir. Chair recognizes representative Holcomb to your left for a question? Does the gentleman yield? Yes, sir. I apologize for not having a chance to speak with you earlier. I've been out a lot, but it's good to be back. My question is in light of the overall economic situation that seems to be unfolding on a daily basis, do you have any concerns in terms of recognizing that we're shifting 100 million from the strategic reserve? Do you have any concerns in terms of the overall budget estimate for those monies that were just anticipating revenues to be received if that needs to be adjusted and maybe it's something we look at down the road? No, yes, sir. We've always got that opportunity. The governor always has that opportunity to adjust that revenue estimate as well. And again, the revenue shortfall reserve fund is there for things like this. This is something that none of us are coming. Otherwise a very healthy economy do realize that there is some angst among our citizenry about things that are going on. However, I would tell you in some conversations this morning that it is felt that it's probably going to be a fairly short-term situation as far as the impact to the markets and things that are going on and then a fairly robust recovery after that point. Thanks. Yes, sir. Do you further you? Yes, sir. Chair recognizes Representative Cannon to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Do you? Yes. Thank you, just to clarify in questions on that similar point, Section 27, around the governor's emergency fund for the Department of Law, anticipated litigation. Can you speak to how that connects to Section 33 or that money is removed from the Department of Law? That was actually a move that the House had made in our original version of moving 2.5 million over for litigation. However, upon further investigation, those funds actually do need to be in the governor's emergency fund because they directly pay to the agencies for any litigation that has incurred. The agencies actually are billed directly and then remit directly from the agency and then what the governor does is issue executive orders transferring funds out of the emergency fund to the agency to reimburse them for those legal expenses. Thank you. Do you, you'll for just one further clarifying question. Yes. First, Section 38, around reducing funds for the maternal and child health services block grant. Can you help me understand why it goes from 197,000 to zero? You said Section 38. Correct. Hold on just a second. I think that deals with the actual. Okay, so the proposed cut looking at line 242.7. Correct. There was a proposed cut of 197, 792 and so what the conference committee has come back where there's an agreement not to take a cut. Thank you, sir. Yes, ma'am. You have other questions, but it's up to you to yield. Mr. Speaker, I will take one more question and otherwise I think everyone knows how they feel about the bill and how they feel about how they're going to vote. I'll be glad to take other questions at my desk during the voting period, but I will take one more question. Chair recognizes representative Vernon Jones to your left for a question. Would it sting, Chairman, to yield, please? Yes, sir. Is it true that although you made some cuts, what we had to, and you also set us out more for our reserves, that it does maintain our good status of a dual AAA credit rating, and that's not being impacted at all? Correct. And it's actually a triple AAA, not just a dual. And talking with the governor's office yesterday morning as we were beginning the discussions on the potential need to have the funds moved over farther spots, they contacted all three of the bond rating agencies yesterday, and all three bond rating agencies did agree and concur that this would be something that they would agree with and not look at unfavorably toward our credit rating. So yes, sir. Mr. Speaker, with that, I will yield the well and again, ask everyone's favorable consideration on this conference committee report. Thank you. Chairman, as yielded the well on the adoption of the conference committee report on House Bill 792, all those in favor of the adoption of the conference committee report will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machines. Members voted, have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the adoption of the conference committee report on House Bill 792. The eyes are 166. The nays are one, and this house has adopted the conference committee report. What purpose does Chairman England rise? Make a motion, Mr. Speaker? State your motion. I move to immediately transmit House Bill 792 to the governor. Chairman England has moved that House Bill 792 be immediately transmitted to the governor of Georgia pursuant to the Constitution of the State of Georgia. Is there objection to the gentleman's motion? Is there objection? Chair here's none, and it is on its way. Do we do? Okay. All right, all those in favor of the motion to immediately transmit to the governor will vote aye. Those opposed to immediate transmit will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the gentleman's motion. The eyes are 169. The nays are zero, and this house has immediately transmitted to the governor House Bill 792. The conference committee report on 792. Chair recognizes the majority leader of the House for a resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. Yesterday, or this week, we adopted a German resolution. Of course, you know, the only thing certain in times, especially like we are in there, is change. So there's some substantial changes that have occurred that all of you are aware about as I am. And part of those changes were a cancellation of numerous events around our state. And those cancellations have impacted our schedule. So let me go with the schedule a little bit with you, and then I'll give you a little more information and tell you what the changes are. We had scheduled to be out of session on Monday and Tuesday of next week to give our members an opportunity to make sure they attended the events that were occurring around the state. So this new resolution will have us in on Tuesday, March 17th, and not out for day 30. We're still in tomorrow for first readers. And I think that's been explained to everyone. The second change on that schedule was towards the end, right, before we finish our work here, was that we were going to be out, we were going to be in on Tuesday, March 31st. We were going to have one committee work day before the signing die. Now this will allow us to have two committee work days on Tuesday, March 31st, and Wednesday, April 1st before the signing die. That's what this resolution I ask you to adopt today. It puts us in step with the Senate on the exact language, exact days, and exact words. Out of abundance of caution, I would ask you to adopt this resolution. Now as we all know, there are some things that are being discussed in this building and how we conduct our business here in the next few days and the next few weeks. And I commend my colleague, Representative Beverly, for his comments about the speaker and the leadership here and how they've always protected our interest and the interests of Jordan's and the safety of us all. I refer to you on Part 5, which is not on the board, but I'll tell you what it says real quickly. This resolution would also resolve in any case from emergency or disaster resultant and in a discontinuation of the schedule for meetings and authorized by this resolution. Speak of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate shall provide for prompt notice of this same to all members of the House of Representatives and all members of the Senate, respectfully. My search means as such officer deemed practical and efficient, and each house shall be and remained in a journey until convened for the next legislative day on the date certain jointly specified by such officers. Following that reconvene we would go back to a schedule and we would have to redo a schedule then. That's exactly what happened in the past few years when we've experienced the weather delays that's impacted our schedule here when we have a schedule that would have been agreed to by both bodies. Lieutenant Governor and the speaker came together and deemed it necessary that we adopt emergency procedures to make sure we would all be safe, but we can return here and adopt and do the people's business at the appropriate time. Mr. Speaker, I think that explains what I'm asking here. If there's any questions I will attempt to answer them and if not I would ask you to adopt this new resolution. Do you have a couple of questions, do you yield? I do. Chair recognizes the minority leader of the House leader, Tramble, to your left for a question. Well, the gentleman, you'll yield. My friend, isn't it true that the resolution that you're asking this house to adopt is a placeholder and does not in any way take any of the options off of the table that are under discussion in this capital today? That is true. Thank you for the question. It is absolutely correct. And will the gentleman further yield? Yes, will. Would the gentleman agree that in all probability that we will not be in session on some of the days that are on the adjournment calendar? If I was a betting man, but I'm not, because always lose when I bet, Mr. Leader, but I think that's a possibility, yes. And would the gentleman yield for one final question? I would. The adoption of this, isn't true that adoption of this resolution in no way takes away the right of any member of this body to move, make any motion pursuant to the rules with respect to anything, including a motion for adjournment. I think that's the case. It's a member of any member of this body, yes, sir. But I would defer to the speaker. Where recognizes the dean of the House representative, Smirie, to your left for a question? I'd like to just follow up with the minority leader. Also, this schedule right here reflects the fact of the matter that now the House and Senate in order for us to do business are now on the same accord as relates to the conduct of business. And it's mission, therefore, and anything that happens on the floor of the House now, the Senate will consider, in vice versa, the House will be considered at the same time. That is exactly correct, Dean. And then, following up also, the minority leader, that subject has changed on the rules of the House. We can always come back and amend resolution that we have adopted that pertains to the agenda. That is exactly correct. In that part five, it says, following reconvening, the General Assembly may provide by joint resolution for a new schedule for meetings and adjournments. And that's the language we would be adopting here, yes sir. I just want to make sure, by the honest to it, thank you very much. No further questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I think we've thoroughly explained it, and I think everyone understands what we're trying to do out of abundance of caution, and I would ask your favor, consideration of adopting this new adjournment resolution. So, let me be sure to sort of summarize the questions that have been asked. This does two things. One, it gets us on the same schedule as the Senate is on. That's correct. And secondly, it carries forward the language that we have historically used that allow the chair and the president of the Senate to adjourn the General Assembly for appropriate reasons. That could be done today, tomorrow or next week. That's correct, Mr. Speaker, just like we've utilized in the past when we had on emergency. And emergency is coming to all different styles and fashions, and certainly that's what we are now, but that's what we've done in the past, yes sir. Thank you, you have no further questions. Thank you Mr. Speaker, you're the will. The question before the body is on the adoption of the House resolution on adjournment. All those in favor of adopting the resolution will vote aye, those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machines. All members voted. Have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the adoption of the resolution of adjournment. The eyes are 168th and the nasor zero, and this resolution has been adopted by this House. What purpose does the majority leader rise? I'd be recognized for a motion, Mr. Speaker. State your motion. Let's speak our move that we immediately transmit the House resolution dealing with the adjournment to the Senate, immediately transmittled. From the gentleman's motion that the adjournment resolution be immediately transmitted to the Senate, is their objection? Is their objection? The chair here is none, and the resolution is on its way over. If we're going to take up a bill or two, if members, the clerk's office tells me they will pass out copies of the resolution. If you want to take your seats, we won't have a line over there. We will make sure you get one here in the next minute or so. Okay, we're going to take up a little business here before we take a break. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1093. House Bill 1093, by Representative Meeksson, on the 7th and 8th, the annulance to be entitled in Act 2, and Article 2, Chapter 8, and Title 2, the fiscal adjoison, and to relating the agricultural commodity commissions generally, so to provide for an agricultural commodity commission for wine and grapes, this bill then referred to the Committee on Agriculture Consumer Affairs. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. They recognize this Representative Meeks to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, I bring to you House Bill 1093, which amends the Commodity Promotions Act under the Department of Agriculture to create an agriculture commodity commission for wine and grapes that has grown and made in Georgia, creates a five-member commission appointed by the Ex officio members, other Georgia Department of Agriculture, requires three years of battle ting, so every three years the commission will have to be reaffirmed by the voting members of the commission. Again, the five-member commission selected by the Ex officios, and also creates a marketing order for the members of the commission to establish a self-assessment for the use of funds to be used for promotion and research of their products. So with that, Mr. Speaker, I'll stand for any questions. You have no questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'll ask for your favoral consideration. Gentlemen, as you all know, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered to Chair Here's None? The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the Report of the Committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill, the Chair Here's None? The Report of the Committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass, all those in favor of the passage of the bill, will vote aye? Those opposed will vote no?

clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 1093. The eyes are 157. The knees are 11. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. The clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1026. The clerk may speak freely to House Bill 1026, the cultura будет the chair recognizes chairman dicki to present the bill.
