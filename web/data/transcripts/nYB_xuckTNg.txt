All right.
Hey.
The speed.
That's good.
Should we get in?
I don't know.
Uh-oh.
All right.
Our second measure of today is House Bill 647.
Representative Donna Tucci, if you'd come to podium
and present force, please.
Thank you, Madam Chair and Committee.
Thank you for hearing this bill today, HB 647.
This is my first time presenting a bill in committee.
My background is in land use.
I served as a Gwinnett County Planning Commissioner.
When I was running for office, one of the most frequent complaints raised by voters to
me, besides inflation, was the issue of growth in Gwyneth County, specifically high-density
apartments and the rapid pace of growth and overburdening local infrastructure. The city
of Mulberry was born out of the frustration and the request of the people, giving citizens
within the county local control over planning and zoning. Now that I'm elected, I'm in
a position to do something to give my constituents more control over growth in our community. This
This annexation simply allows the city of Mulberry to expand into my district, adding
roughly 45 parcels to the city limits.
These parcels are a mix of residential dwellings, commercial properties, and undeveloped land,
primarily located along one road on the north end of my district.
Moving these parcels into the city of Mulberry will allow my constituents to have a greater
local voice over how this land is developed and used in the future, allowing
decisions to be made by five locally elected citizens, Councilmen, rather than a
majority of county commissioners who do not live in the community. I understand
there's Councilmen here today from Mulberry and I'm happy to have them come up
and testify but first I'll answer any questions. Madam Chairman. All right thank
Thank you so much and I know it's a little nerve wracking when it's your first bill so I will just tell you someone give me some great advice on my first bill they said if you don't know just say you don't know when the second good piece of advice is you can take a breath.
I promise. Thank you.
All right. Does anyone have any questions regarding the measures brought by representative Donna Tucci?
We've got a couple of questions
Representative Martinez let's hear from you first. Yes, Madam Mayor at the appropriate time. I'd like to do the bill do pass
All right. Thank you. Stand by. Okay. Well, all right. Are you waving representative Clark? Okay. Thank you
All right. We do have a motion at this time. Do we in a second calling the question all those in favor of passing the measure
brought forth on House Bill 647. Say aye. Opposed?
We do have one on post. Thank you. The measure does pass.
Thank everyone for their time and consideration on this matter and
have a wonderful safe trip home. Thank you.
