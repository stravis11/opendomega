TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good afternoon everybody and welcome. My name is Saira Draper and I'm the state
representative for House District 90 in Atlanta and to Cab County. We are here
today to address the systemic attacks and dismantling of public health by our
own government. I along with the other elected officials you will hear from
today represent areas near and where the CDC is located. We have many
constituents who are directly impacted by what has been happening at the centers for
disease control and prevention.
And yes, we are fighting for those constituents, but do not be confused, because this is not
just a cab county issue, this is not just an Atlanta issue, this is not just a federal
worker issue.
The work of the CDC impacts every Georgian, every American, and indeed it has worldwide
implications because such is the work of public health. Many people may not realize what
public health is because when it is working you do not see it. You do not notice the
Listeria outbreak that was stopped before the cold cuts left the processing facility. You
do not see the influenza or avian flu event that was prevented because of good vaccination
policies. And Ebola seems like a far off disease because CDC workers put themselves in harm's
way to stop the spread before it reaches our borders. Where doctors in an office or hospital
are focused on the care of the single patient, public health officials work to improve health
of entire populations. And so when you mess with the CDC, you mess with all of us. We
We just left an eye-opening roundtable discussion with a number of former CDC employees.
It really laid bare the attack that these public servants have been under.
From the erasure of data to the dismantling of effective health programs to dodging literal
bullets, the folks at the CDC have endured the unthinkable.
And why?
Why do they put up with it?
Because they are deeply committed to the mission of saving lives.
Many of these people have worked for decades in the sector, across many presidential
administrations, never allowing politics to interfere, always looking to the silent
science to guide the policy.
So let me give you an overview of what you will be hearing today.
First you will hear from Representative Omari Crawford, who will kick us off with a
very important tribute.
Next you will hear from Dr. Deb Hauri and Dr. Dan Jernigan, who resigned from the CDC
last week after the controversial ouster of CDC director Maneras.
Then you will hear for Senator Elena Parent on the impact of the administration's rhetoric
on public health.
Next you will hear from Representative Mary Margaret Oliver who will speak on the shooting
at the CDC and the legislature's refusal to pass meaningful gun safety legislation.
And finally you will hear from rep Moni Barnes from her perspective as a scientist.
I will close us out with a call to support from our state leaders and open up the floors
to questions from the press.
So without any further ado, representative Umari Crawford.
Good afternoon.
I'm Umari Crawford, the state rep out of Georgia's 89th house district, home to the Centers
for Disease and Prevention, better known as the CDC, our nation's leading public health
agency and one of the most important agencies in our world. Before we begin this critical
conversation, I think it's very appropriate and necessary that we take a minute to
acknowledge the legacy of the Cad County officer who tragically lost his life on August 8th.
Officer David Rose ran towards danger on that day after her reports of gunfire near
the CDC, and in the line of duty, he made the ultimate sacrifice to protect others.
He lived by the principles that he spoke about at his police academy graduation, and that
is protecting the vulnerable, standing for justice, and running towards danger when others
may run away.
After that tragic incident, the legislatures that you see here today knew that we had
to respond.
It was not a matter of if, but it was a matter of when.
Because as my friend representative Draper says
that when an event like this happens,
it not only impacts the people in the community,
but it impacts everyone globally.
And so I asked that we take a moment of silence
to honor officer Rose, who was an American hero.
If you would, please take a moment of silence.
Office of roles die protecting another group of heroes, some of them that you see standing with me.
These men and women work tirelessly around the clock to ensure that we are saved.
Our public health care workers make sure that we are protected from diseases and illnesses
and they make it their life mission to ensure our safety. And while there are tools of danger,
may be different from those in law enforcement and make no mistake about it, that CDC employees
also risk their lives on a daily basis to make sure that we are safe, and it is important that we
stand up with them. In today's climate of misinformation, conspiracy theories and politically
motivated rhetoric, our CDC heroes are under attack. Let me be clear that the baseless
vilification of CDC professionals is dangerous and it undermines not only their health,
but it compromises our nation's ability to respond to each and every health crisis that may occur.
Words have consequences. Let me repeat that. Words have consequences. And the recent violent incident
at the CDC was not an isolated act. It was direct result of inflammatory, irresponsible language
from some of our own leaders. This cannot continue, and if those leaders will not speak up in
defense of science, data, and public health, then we will. The continued support of the CDC
is not optional. It is essential. Without the CDC programs that serve millions of Americans,
especially those in rural areas, those with disabilities,
and low-income families are put at risk.
And the ripple effect of weakening the CDC
are their attempt at weakening the CDC.
It's massive as it impacts every corner of our country.
Each hero working in public health puts themselves
on the front line every day, and we're very grateful for you.
you all face threats and expose yourselves to dangers
that many laypeople cannot even imagine.
We just had a very critical conversation in listening
to what CDC employees do on a daily basis.
It's not only heroic, it's honorable,
and we need to protect you.
You all have the education, the training,
and the experience that we depend upon
and so we have to trust your work
and we must protect you so that you can do your work
without fear or harassment.
We should never tolerate the harassment of our heroes,
and we never would, and in the other industry,
our heroes would never be the victim of abuse.
In any other industry,
heroes would never be villainized
in a way that our public health workers are,
and so we cannot tolerate it here.
Our public health professionals need our help,
and the voices of some of those
who support you, like us standing here,
needs to be louder than the ill-advised,
ill-informed, the inexperienced, and untrained people
who are saying things that do not match facts.
I am going to stand amongst you
and I thank you for all of the work that you do.
Thank you for your courage, thank you for your sacrifice,
and thank you for your service to your communities
and to our globe.
Thank you.
Well, good afternoon. I'm Dr. Deb Howery, and as of a couple weeks ago, I wouldn't have
thought I would be here today, and so I don't have prepared remarks, but a few things
I just wanted to share. First, I've worked across several administrations and was actually
asked to be the transition lead for CDC because of my work across administrations. What
What this means is that I was welcoming the Trump Administration and Secretary Kennedy
to really see how we could help our priorities at CDC and those of the department align.
Under the prior Trump Administration, we advanced things like vaccines and overdoses.
So I was optimistic, I'm a mom, I'm a life, I'm a doctor, I'm a scientist, I work here
at Grady, I care about saving lives as do all the people behind me that are former CDC
people.
When I look at how right now decisions about vaccines are being made based on opinion and
not data or science, that concerns me.
When I see how our non-communicable diseases like chronic disease and the work we've done
on overdose are being defunded and moved, I'm worried we're not going to be prepared
for those health threats as well.
And when I think about the substantial talent that is being lost, the brain drain right
here in Atlanta and to our state, and the funding that is being lost to our state and local
health departments and communities, I'm concerned.
I love CDC, I love the work that I was doing, but being asked to take documents down that
were scientific, I could not do.
And after seeing the politicization of work that shouldn't be politicized, it's about
saving lives and making a difference. Myself and several my colleagues knew that
enough was enough and together our voices were stronger so we were happy to
talk with y'all afterwards but know that CDC is in our blood. You all matter to
us and we are here because now is the time to look at how we can work together
work as Republicans and Democrats to make a difference in our community right
here in Atlanta and Georgia. Thank you.
Thanks very much. My name is Dan Jernigan. I'm the former director of the National
Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases at CDC. I've been at CDC for 31
years. I've worked for part of that time with CDC at the Washington State Health Department.
I've been working through multiple different agencies
through many years, different presidents,
Republicans, Democrats, and have been able to get the work
of public health done throughout all of that time.
But we find ourselves now with the difficulty in doing that
because of the current secretary.
We know that the agencies, as we've been hearing,
is under attack.
I was actually in one of the buildings
when the bullets started flying.
Some of the buildings were the bullets hit.
We were on the phone with folks in other parts of the CDC
who were telling us that the building is shaking.
What's going on?
We were able to see the fire department pull out
from the fire station right next to CDC,
trying to get people to turn around so that they didn't drive
into the firing of that shooter.
That was a physical attack, and we mourned for Officer Rose.
and the work that he did to help protect us,
but that physical attack, I did not get physically attacked,
but the agency itself has been attacked with rhetoric
and with the kinds of information that's being put out there
that really does not lead us to better public health.
In public health over 31 years,
we realize CDC is not perfect.
It is continually being revised.
It is continually asking questions
about how to do things better,
trying to address whether or not the status quo needs
to be changed, it can do that.
It changes all the time.
It can look to innovations.
But right now, however, I was in a situation
where I could not stay any longer,
because the current secretary and the immediate offices
of the secretary, we're not following
the existing executive order on transparency
and gold standard science.
We need to make sure that when they say,
We need to be transparent that we understand
how the studies are being done that will be released
in the next couple of weeks.
When they say gold standard science,
do we know that they are following objective approaches
to looking at the data and coming up
with the answers regardless of what you want them to show?
And then finally, when Dr. Menora's was released
from her job, it really indicated that her ability
to use science as the driver for public health policy making
and for her ability to have independence
with the advisory committee for immunization practices
where vaccine decisions are made.
Both of those things looks like we would not be able
to do that any longer.
We would not have a director that could do that.
And that was the final straw for me,
for Dr. Howard and Dr. Descalakis.
So what's at risk right now?
I think you could almost see this as death by 1,000 cuts.
We're cutting staff, we're cutting resources,
we're undercutting science and that's leading
to the undermining of trust.
And so for us right now, we need to do everything we can
to work with the current administration as we can,
but also to get folks out there and ask that science
be put first, ideology put second,
and that we can get back to protecting Americans here.
Thanks.
Thank you so much, Dr. Tari, and Jernigan.
We respect your many, many years of service to all of us through your positions at the
CDC and appreciate you being with us today, as well as everyone else who has worked at
and cares about the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who are here with us today.
My name is Senator Elena Parent and I represent the 44th Senate District, which does include
the headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
What happened on August 8th at the CDC was not just a tragedy.
It was a wake-up call.
The death of Officer David Rose and the terror inflicted upon CDC staff and all the surrounding
neighborhoods were the direct result of a climate that has grown increasingly hostile
towards public health workers. According to multiple press reports, the shooter believed
that the COVID vaccine had made him ill. He blamed the CDC and acted on that belief with deadly
violence. But this wasn't an isolated incident. It was the culmination of years of inflammatory
rhetoric, misinformation, and political attacks on science itself. We have seen federal leaders
delay their response, downplay the threat, and in some cases actively fuel it. Health
Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has repeatedly spread false claims about mRNA vaccines,
even terminating contracts for their development just days before the shooting.
His statements, since becoming Secretary and for many years before it, have undermined
trust in science and emboldened those who view public health professionals not as protectors,
as enemies. In the wake of the shooting, President Trump has not made any public remarks about
the shooting or about the shooter's motivating beliefs. A striking omission from someone
who claims to be tough on crime and supportive of law enforcement.
This omission gives tacit approval to the shooter's views.
Make no mistake.
We cannot build vaccine policy on suspicion, misinformation, or politics, as this administration
is clearly doing.
Our policies must be grounded in science, transparency, and the collective expertise
of people who have dedicated their lives to public health.
Staff at the CDC have voiced their frustration and fear.
They've watched their budget slashed, their expertise dismissed,
and now their safety compromised.
The shooter fired hundreds of rounds into six CDC buildings.
That level of violence does not happen in a vacuum.
It happens in a culture that is being fueled
by this administration directly,
this president directly,
where public servants are vilified
and the truth is treated as optional.
To all of those at the CDC who feel abandoned
or ignored in this moment. We want you to know that we hear you. We see you. We
appreciate you. And we, those of you who have been elected to this General
Assembly, will use our voices to amplify your voices. We must name this for
what it is, a systemic attack on public health. And we must respond not with silence, not
with spin, but with solidarity for those employees who have dedicated their lives to saving
ours, truth and action. Because if we don't lift our voices to protect the people who
protect us, we all pay the price. Thank you very much.
Thank you, everyone, for being here today. I'm Mary Margaret Oliver, State Representative
House District 84, and in my long career, both the House and the Senate, I've represented
the CDC community continuously.
I live about 200 yards off the Henry Campus.
I have had an opportunity to work on gun violence prevention
legislation in this building from both sides of the aisle,
from the House and the Senate.
And I want to give you just a very brief history
of why gun violence prevention legislation is today the most
partisan issue that I have dealt with in a long political career.
That was not always true, and that's my real message this morning.
We have in the past had obvious victories and progress with bipartisan gun violence prevention
legislation that somehow today has come to a stop.
I was the sponsor of legislation to ban assault weapons for several years.
That bill was never allowed a hearing in this building.
And the reason that I brought that legislation forward in the Georgia legislative role was
as you know in 1994, in a bipartisan effort, Congress banned assault weapons.
And based on a political compromise of that day, they banned them for 10 years thinking
they would revisit the issue in 2004. When 2004 came, there was no compromise. The
partisanship around gun violence prevention had taken over and grown and the
assault weapon banned federally was walked away from. Here's the question I want
you to ask, how many children would be alive today if the assault weapon ban had
remained in effect legally? Think about the patterns of school violence, shootings,
and murders, and what was the weapon used and ask that question to your neighbors,
to the folks that you go to the soccer games with, and to all of those of you in
your families and communities that care about gun violence prevention.
Earlier in my career, there was a legitimate bipartisan discussion, Senators and House
members on a variety of issues.
We weren't successful in passing a lot of that, but we did have civil and specific conversations
about gun storage, about liability, and about opportunities in hearings where law enforcement
would come forward and talk about the need for gun violence prevention.
I call upon the Senate leader, Bert Jones, the House leader, Speaker John Burns, to
reconvene a bank partisan hearing and discussion
about bipartisan need for gun violence prevention.
We are at a point where we know our constituents
care about this issue, and we are at a point
where an honest discussion is more needed now
than it ever has been.
Thank you very much.
Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Representative Imani Barnes. I represent House District 86,
which is in Tucker and actually encompasses some parts of Emory University. I proudly
stand here as a scientist and with a career in public health and a doctoral candidate
in public health. Public health and science is my passion and I draft a lot of my policy
of using public health methods and data and science. Too often public health is invisible
until something goes wrong, as my colleague also said,
doctors and nurses, we understand what they do,
they treat individuals, but public health,
public health protects populations,
and that's something we can't physically touch
as doctors and nurses, but we know makes a difference.
It's the reason we have safe drinking water.
It's why smoking rates are down.
It's the reason we have systems in place to trace outbreaks,
deliver vaccines, and respond to hurricanes,
and reduce maternal mortality and mental health.
Public health is the quiet shield that surrounds all of us
when it's working, and most people never even notice it,
again, as my colleague said.
But when it breaks down, the consequences are devastating.
So what happens without public health?
We've already begun to see those consequences.
Cuts to the CDC and the NIH.
Just don't weaken the federal government.
They destabilize local clinics and research centers
and mental health clinics.
Emergency response teams across Georgia become depleted.
As was said earlier, about $0.80 of every dollar
in CDC's domestic budget goes directly to state
and local institutions.
I happen to be an employee of one of the local institutions
who was also affected by the shooting.
As we're discussing CDC, the community,
the other local institutions were also affected
who had to go to work the next day
and be in that scared and silent environment
after just having a terrorist attack on something
that we also do.
This funding supports disease prevention, emergency response,
and other things that I've already stated.
When it's slashed, the consequences are predictable.
We know what happens when we don't have public health.
More illnesses, more preventable deaths.
And if we want to entice others who don't believe in this
science, it eventually affects our economy.
These are important services that impact real families living
in the state of Georgia every single day.
Right now, there's mRNA research that's leading
to vaccine technology.
And it's already saved millions of lives.
And it has the potential to prevent cancer.
But progress like that does not happen
without sustained investment in our public health systems.
You can't isolate public health from the rest of the society.
It touches everything, it touches our school,
it touches our jobs, it touches our justice system,
our safety, our sense of safety.
And let room remind you of something
that we may all be aware of, public health achievements
that have been in history.
They're a eradication of smallpox.
We got measles coming back in Texas,
and we're not very well educated
because we can't be with the current administration.
The eradication of smallpox was a CDC-led effort.
And without that, can you imagine what our nation would be like?
Can you imagine if the funds dried up then
in politics overshadowed science then?
To dismantle public health is to destabilize
the very fabric of our society.
It's not a privilege to have public health.
It's a lifeline.
We owe it to our communities, our researchers,
our scientists, our responders,
and we owe it to Officer David Rose
who fought for us in the event that we had a terrorist attack.
Not just because it's a crisis,
but we need to fight for public health every single day.
And thank you for your time.
In February, I stood here on these steps with many of these same folks behind me, and
it was in the thick of the doge cuts to the CDC. Thousands of jobs were being slashed
indiscriminately without any seeming regard for the repercussions to public health.
And at that time, we begged state leaders in Georgia to do something.
To speak up for Georgians, to protect their work and their livelihoods, and to fight for
the science that would keep us healthier and safer.
And we were met with silence and with shrugged shoulders.
On August 8th, Governor Kemp rightly praised Officer Rose for his heroism during the
attack on the CDC campus. But he said nothing about the terror endured by CDC staff, the
children and the caregivers at the onsite childcare center, or the ripple of fear felt
across nearby institutions. And that silence matters. Perhaps he is following the signals
of President Trump, who also has said nothing publicly about the shooting of a federal agency.
And while Secretary Kennedy acknowledged the shooting, his concern was seemingly short
lived, because he forced out CDC director Minaras for saying the obvious that anti-vaccine
rhetoric contributed to the shooting.
health in this country has never been more under threat.
So we, again, call on Governor Kemp to take action, not only on behalf of his constituents
whose livelihoods are threatened, but on behalf of all Georgians whose health is at stake.
Governor Kemp, we are calling on you to publicly support the CDC.
Not just as a federal agency, but as a cornerstone of Georgia's identity and global leadership.
Express empathy for the staff who have been terrorized, dismissed, and demoralized.
Stand with the scientists, the epidemiologists, the data analysts, and the community of health
workers who have dedicated their lives to protecting ours.
recommendation we have is that you protect Georgians by establishing state-based
public health strategies. For example, since decisions about vaccine access are
now being politicized, Georgia can develop a state-based vaccine access
strategy, purchasing vaccines directly and authorizing state-run clinics to
offer off-label vaccinations under physician guidance. This would ensure
access for vulnerable populations, especially those excluded by
and politicized federal guidelines.
Governor Kemp,
we call on you to build or join multi-state coalitions
to defend science and share resources,
partnering with other states to issue joint statements,
coordinate legal strategies,
and amplify evidence-based public health messaging.
And finally, we ask you, Governor Kemp,
to reaffirm a commitment to transparency
and public trust, communicating clearly,
and consistently about public health interventions
grounded in science, not politics.
And I'll say one more thing.
There have been many campaigns launched
for statewide office in the last few months.
If you are a candidate running for statewide office in 2026
and you are not fighting for the CDC
and by direct extension, the public health,
you have no business being entrusted
a position of leadership. Stand up, speak out today. Public health is not just about responding
to crisis. It is about preventing them. It is about surveillance, science, and service,
measuring threats, understanding their causes, and implementing interventions that protect
entire populations. And when it works, it saves lives quietly, efficiently, and cost effectively.
We cannot afford to lose this capacity. We cannot afford to lose the CDC, and we cannot afford
to lose the moral clarity that comes from standing up for science, for safety, and for the people of
Georgia. If there's any questions from the press, we will take them at this time.
That's a great question because over and over again, we have said that this is not a political
issue. It shouldn't be a political issue. But, you know, I'll refer you back to February
when we held a press conference during the legislative session. And while there were
a lot of people here in the audience, probably both Democrats and Republicans, none of my
Republican colleagues on the other side of the aisle were here.
And so unfortunately, I think people take a lot of their direction from the top.
And the Trump administration has politicized what shouldn't be a political issue.
And look, the reality is, if you're a politician in Georgia, it is scary to go up against Trump,
right?
There are repercussions for people who go up against Trump.
And so people might be weighing the consequences of standing up and doing what's right.
And here's the thing, with this issue, it's black and white.
We are either protecting the people of Georgia or we're forwarding our political ambitions.
And if that's what my colleagues are doing, they're making the wrong choice and shouldn't
be in leadership.
Yeah, and first I want to say I'm sorry for the loss of your friend
We did and we took notes and what I would say okay so I appreciate that you
know happy to have a discussion later but Dan and I are going to just try to
answer your question and what I would what I would say is may I listen to you I
hope you'll listen to me and what I would just say is we have a vaccine safety
review that we do can I can I finish and what I would just say is we look at
every death, we do have investigations that happen and when we saw that there were issues
like even recently with the Chukaganya virus, we quickly acted and worked with FDA to change
it.
Dan, do you want to add anything to that?
There are multiple different vaccine systems that we used to monitor safety at CDC and those
systems have been in place for a while.
Many of that data is actually public data.
So happy to follow up with you on how better we can do to how better CDC can do to make
that are more available to folks.
Thanks.
Thanks.
We have another question.
So why was the CV saved soon?
Why was the CV saved?
We're going to wait out.
We're going to let them ask for a question.
Look, when it comes to outsider points of view,
I don't think that's the issue.
But the science is the science, whether you believe it
or not.
And the science is truth, whether you believe it or not.
So to the extent, so what I will just say
as a transition lead in the chief medical officer.
I did read RFK Junior's books.
I was also willing to brief him on measles, vaccines,
H5N1, but I never did.
I was never asked.
Thank you.
Next question.
I think we're already feeling it, you know, when we've had over 2,000 people impacted by
a reduction in force, that impacts our labor, our spending, and the economic development
in this city, certainly I think we're going to see even more of a ripple effect as budget
cuts impact the state and local health departments.
I think that's when we'll see it even broader across Georgia, but we're feeling it now.
The people behind me, many of them, lost their jobs, so we're already feeling this.
And I think that's what's important is understanding that people here are trying to save lives.
They dedicated themselves to this.
They are career public servants.
Yeah, I think it's a CDC isn't alone in public health.
Most public health is done at the state public health
departments and at local health departments.
And much of that is supported with federal funds.
Upwards of 90% of community disease departments in state
health departments are funded with federal funds.
And so as there are cuts to CDC, there
will be cuts then to the state health department and services
like monitoring foodborne illness, vector control,
things like that that you may not even know is happening
around you, you'll start to see that that's not happening
in the increase in cases of disease
that are associated with that.
You know, 50% of the budget comes,
that's pharmaceutical.
All right.
Okay, next question.
Can you repeat the question we couldn't hear?
Do you mean with the department or with the community?
by HHS, I say because at CDC we deployed people to Texas,
worked very closely with the State Health Department
who was a wonderful partner.
Same thing with many of the surrounding states,
we did provide vaccines and other therapeutics
as well as on the ground, technical assistance.
Myself and the measles team were not asked
to brief the secretary, we did offer.
We did, we were asked for updates
and we provide data regularly on measles
and we publish it on our website too.
It's very open and transparent to the public,
both on vaccinated, unvaccinated cases
and where it spreads across the nation.
The vast majority of cases come from outside the US,
but then are spread among populations
that are not vaccinated.
So the new director is an acting director, so my hope is that the president does determine
a new, you know, permanent director because what is really neat is permanent scientific
leadership.
The deputy secretary who's the acting director has an operations background and so that's
important, but he needs a strong scientific and medical bench around him, and that is
currently lacking given many of the departures.
Dr. Minar is the first non-physician, but she was a PhD scientist.
This would be the first non-physician or non-scientist to be leading an agency, and I do think
it's important when that new bug or pathogen happens, or when there's an outbreak to know
What to do on spur of the moment when you do get that call from the White House
The CDC has a long history of looking at the science methodically going through it, identifying
where the biases are and then coming up with recommendations that are science-driven.
The staff will continue to do that.
At this point, there's a lot that still is up on the website that you can trust.
My concern is that anything coming out after a couple of weeks from now that if it is placed
on the CDC website with regard to vaccine safety, I'm not so sure if we can trust that information.
My request to the secretary is to get back to science driven development of policy, looking
at the data.
We can do that.
We can look at all sides of information and come up with the best path forward and we would
asked that he would do that, just as we've done in the past.
Yeah, I think there's a what we're seeing is that there's a lot of uncertainty out there
right now and that's leading to people having indecision so they're not choosing to get vaccinated
whereby it would have been very simple for them to do that previously. I'm concerned about
that because I think without those vaccines people will be getting respiratory illnesses,
especially those that are at higher risk. So we want people to take those vaccines. We hope
that they will be available. I was referring to some statements that the Secretary has made about
revelations of new scientific findings that will come out in the next couple weeks.
I think that was some of the comments I made previously about transparency and gold standard science it's not that I know that something is coming out. I don't know what's coming out.
They can, but most scientists will usually have a protocol, they'll publish that protocol,
you'll know exactly how they're doing their analysis to provide data that you can then
re-analyze.
I'm not sure what will happen here.
This is not the way that we do science at CDC.
All right, thank you very much, we're going to stop this now, but thank you very much
for your time and we appreciate your attention to this matter.
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
My brain turned up because I was...
