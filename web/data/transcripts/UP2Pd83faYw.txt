morning roll call. All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines. Well good morning. Welcome to legislative day 19 almost half time. A little housekeeping matter here before we start as today as you probably know is we'll hear the state of the judiciary. We will not do morning orders before the state of judiciary. We simply have too many that have signed up and so we'll we'll try to get to those later in the day but we're going to take care of our business. We will get as far on invite resolutions as we can and we may have to come back to those later on. So that's just for your planning purposes. Chair heard from Chairman Gerald Green early this morning. He is in a lot of pain and got another procedure coming up tomorrow and he asked me to express his appreciation for thoughts and prayers of this body. During the time he's been in the hospital and I don't know how many of you know but Chairman Bonnie Rich is also hospitalized and got a little better report on her this morning. So keep her and her family in your thoughts too. We will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 180th House District Representative Stephen Sains Representative Sains. Thank you Mr. Speaker. It is a true honor to introduce a friend a servant of Christ here today. I met a Martin several years ago as he took a leadership role in our local chamber representing his well-respected heating and air company. I was not aware of pastor turner until a year or two after though I couldn't say I was surprised if you know Martin you know his heart more specifically his passion for taking the heart that Christ shows us outside of church walls. Getting a little bit more intel from his leaders in his church on pastor turner. I was told multiple times to know Martin just likes being out there and that's exactly what he does from leading multiple new outreach campaigns at Southeast Community Church to spreading his light on lighthouse Christian radio whose founders Paul and Vicki Hafer are here today to his work as a leader in Camden's business community. You see the love of Christ and just about every word indeed Martin takes and above all other titles pastor turners the husband of Sherry father of Martin Junior and Will and grandfather of Andrew Aaron Ashton Caroline Callie McKenna Rachel and Zach and it's a true honored introduce and please welcome pastor turner. I need a stool. Last year I was here and you guys had a speaker that told you thank you in 18 different languages. I got to say I was extremely impressed. She never even looked at a note and I thought oh my I could never ever do that. As a matter of fact the only other language I know besides Georgian is Conan A. Greek and when I was in Bible college taking Conan A. Greek and we had to bring in a Greek New Testament to read we couldn't read anything else my professor said that I was the only student he ever had that spoke Southern Conan A. Greek. Mr. Speaker and members of this House of Representatives Stephen Spain's Saints as well. Good morning and thank you for allowing me to speak with you this morning. I want to begin by reading a story given to me by a young lady in our county that you guys this house in 1937 actually helped today which tells me how important what you do is in all of our lives. She writes in her own words I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer on February the first 2018 during a routine hernia repair operation at a local hospital in Brunswick, Georgia. When I woke to the news that cancer had been found I did not mourn or weak but stayed unusually calm. You see I had every reason to worry for my health and my finances all at once in 2012 I decided to end my insurance coverage as I could no longer afford it. I had hoped for a working 40 hours a week I could no longer afford it. Working 40 plus hours a week for years did not result in the financial stability that I'd hoped for. God was in control though as I met my financial services at the our hospital not only did he provide the best doctors for me on the path to healing but he also sent me an employee of the hospital who was fully versed in programs offered by the state of Georgia. I began paperwork for the state support assistance program that was available. This incredible program covered my chemo and oncologist and I'm so grateful for that. So I say two things today. First that is because of laying my full faith in trusting Christ and believing in full healing that I am alive today. Second it is the programs like this program that makes such a big impact on the lives of many Georgians every day. So please continue every each moment in the position that you're in now with the knowledge and wisdom that you are a part of making an impact on the lives of friends neighbors and beyond. Thank you she said because you see I understand what it's like to do all these things and know you don't do what you do for money. Hold on one second I knew this was gonna happen to me. I had to read that. Okay start over I thought you guys may want to hear some positive news news from someone that actually received the help they needed when you were there. Her name is Christina Panzon. She volunteers her time and energy to always help those around her. She serves in our fellowship in church as a sound technician. She's a graphic artist who has a bachelor's degree from Valdosta State. She spends time in our student ministry and she has an inspiration to so many in our community. Without this help she probably would not even be alive today. So I looked at you guys I looked at your bios online and I saw that this is an extremely diverse group. I want to read some of them. Some of you are business owners, paramedics, attorneys, pilots, teachers, bankers, pharmacists, insurance agents, directors of nonprofits, farmers, CPAs, funeral directors, doctors, ministers, administrators, college instructors, general contractors, military or retired military officers, police, engineers, truck drivers, and alts and ears, and many more vocations and professions that make up this distinguished body. Wow. When I said melting pot I wasn't lying. This is a melting pot from Georgia. Talk about a diverse group, you're it, and yet you managed to do great things for our state. Look at this because of you even though this was done in 1937 this body helped the lady in 2020 to live on and make an impact in her neighborhood. She's 37 years old and she has a chance. You see because I know you guys where many hats and I know you have many responsibilities and I know that everything you do is under a microscope. I thank you though for your commitment to your community in our state and thank you for your wisdom and knowledge to serve our state. Because you see I don't understand what I do understand what it's like to do these things and I know you don't do it for the money. There isn't enough money to do this. So as a small business owner for the past 20 years I thank you for your service. As an air minister at the lighthouse WECC for the past eight years I thank you for your service as the executive pastor of Southeast Community Church in Kingsland, Georgia. I thank you for your service. So my prayer is that God would grant you today his wisdom and knowledge to govern our state and that all of us would maintain an attitude of servant leadership. Please continue to serve. In the Old Testament Solomon asked God to grant him wisdom and knowledge that he would be able to govern effectively. God's response was this reading from 2nd Chronicles chapter 1 verses 11 and 12 since this is your heart's desire and you have not asked for wealth possession of honor nor the death of your enemies. I remember they asked Billy Graham's wife one time and if she really believed that the Bible was a real word of God to which she replied of course and they said well what do you think about divorce and she said divorce no murder maybe. Since this is what he says is your heart's desire and you have not asked for wealth possession of honor nor the death of your enemies and since you have not asked for a long life but for wisdom and knowledge to govern my people over whom I've made you king therefore wisdom and knowledge I will give you. Please stand with me. Let's pray. Father I love you with my whole heart but God helped me to continue to do just that and Lord I pray for this body I pray for this house. God give them knowledge to begin with and then give them the wisdom to know how to handle that knowledge so that they can serve the state of Georgia that they can serve this 10.6 million people that they serve every day when they make decisions in this house. I thank you for them God. I thank you that they have that servants heart and that they deliver in Jesus name. Amen. So, thank you for your question under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Doorkeepers will unlock the doors. The Chair recognizes Chairman Hogan the Chair of the Committee on Information and Audits.

Connert to the 102nd Clark 100 and 8th McLean to the 100th. We're into the 96th. Harold of the 106th and others. A resolution commending in Jay Allen Wilbank CEO and Superintendent of Gwyneth County Public Schools and for other purposes. Chair recognizes representative Connert for an invite resolution. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Gwyneth has been one of the fastest growing and thriving counties in our state and nation for many decades. The primary reason for this combustible attraction is our school system. One out of every ten public school dollars is spent in Gwyneth County and that is because one out of every K through 12 Georgia students are in Gwyneth. Gwyneth County Public Schools is the largest employer in our county and is the largest provider of public transportation in the state with the exception of Marda. The Gwyneth County Public Schools not only tout size and quantity, we also produce a quality educational standard by every metric for students and teachers. Forbes ranks our school system number 19 in the U.S. for women to work. Two of our dollars now teach for GCPS. So the past five years, Gwyneth has produced three Georgia principals of the year and in 2020 Gwyneth's Carinza Wing was announced National Principal of the Year at first for Georgia. I could literally go on and on about what makes Gwyneth County Public Schools distinctive. But let me cut to the chase, its leadership. At the helm of this gigantic and powerfully effective educational system is Alvin Wilbanks. It is not an overstatement to call his body of educational work in Georgia, legendary and epic. Starting his career in education at the Cap County, he was the first president of Gwyneth Technical College in 1984, a school that has thrived ever since. In 96, Mr. Wilbanks became the superintendent of Gwyneth County Public Schools and from that day to this it continues to elevate its status as a world class learning institution. I am pleased with you today to honor with House Resolution 1018, this educational giant and very fine man, Alvin Wilbanks. Would you welcome him, please? Thank you very much, Representative Genter, Speaker Austin, Speaker Pro Tim Jones, Majority Leader of RAP Burns, Minority Leader Bob Trammell. It is a great pleasure to be with you today in this distinguished and august body. I appreciate what you do for education through your legislation as well as through your support and through the budget. One of the things that we can be very proud of in the state of Georgia, education is some priority, the sobriety of this general assembly is a priority by the governor as well as our citizens. Our effort is to make sure that every child gets a quality and effective education and we will make sure that we continue to do that. With that, let me just conclude by saying to each of you, I humbly ask that you continue to do it, for the students, their parents and citizens of this great state supporting public education. We have somewhere in neighborhood of 50 million students at a 10 public schools. We have somewhere in neighborhood of three and a quarter million teachers that teach in public schools. And some of the best reside here in this great state of Georgia. So with that, let me say, it's been an honor to be with you this morning. Thank you for what you do. Keep Georgia the best state in our great U.S. United States of America. God bless you on the state of Georgia and the United States of America. Thank you. We will not have time for the third invite resolution. I don't want to rush it through because I anticipate in just a few minutes that the members of the Senate will, after wandering around in the hallway, we'll find refuge here in our chamber. And we will have the state of the judiciary. We're going to be at ease until the chair calls you back in. If I could have your attention, please, I need to ask everyone who is not a member of the House of Representatives or authorized staff to leave the floor at this time. We've got to make sure that we have all of our seating. Only House members and authorized staff are permitted on the floor. Okay, that's a two-gabble hit. That means they're on their way. So I'm going to ask the members of the House give up the comfort of the annual room and begin to find your seats. Madam Dorkeaper, just a moment please. Members of the House, for about the fourth time please take your seats. Madam Dorkeaper, the President, the President, and the President of the Senate, may I please allow the President and the President and the members of the Senate to enter the House chamber and the messenger will escort them to their designated seats. I was telling the Lieutenant Governor that the House is a very spirited bunch today. Let's see if we can sort of contain that here just for a while. This House and Senate and Joint Session will come to order. Come to order, please, we're about to have some other distinguished guests come in. It is my distinct honor at this time to introduce to you a former member of this body. And now the Lieutenant Governor of our state, Lieutenant Governor Jeff Duncan. Thank you. Thank you very much. It's an honor to be back here. Members of the General Assembly, the Joint Session will come to order all members. I would ask that you take your seats. All members, please take your seats. Mr. Sergeant of Arms. Mr. President, the Honorable Harold Molton, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the Justice of the Supreme Court, and the Judges of the Court of P.O. await interest to the Chamber.

Thank you very much. Please receive it. Thank you. They stand when we walk into a courtroom but they don't applaud, so thank you very much. Lieutenant Governor Duncan, Speaker of Austin, President, Pro Tem Miller, Speaker of Pro Tem Jones, Members of the General Assembly, Constitutional Officers, My Fellow Judges, Ladies and Gentlemen. Each day that I go to work from whatever angle I approach, I am struck by the majesty of the first state building in Georgia's history dedicated solely to the judiciary. I enter the new Nathan Diel Judicial Center with all in humility. Mindful that all of us who work here and all who work in the judicial system statewide are united for a single purpose to uphold the rule of law and render impartial justice to all Georgia citizens, regardless of their circumstances. Once I get into my office, I am struck by the view out my window, a view that looks appropriately upward with respect toward the equally majestic state capital building. Today I say thank you to you on behalf of my colleagues in the judiciary for your support and investment in the judicial branch of government. I thank Governor Brian Kemp and I thank former Governor Nathan Diel for their roles in making so many people's dreams become a reality. The Nathan Diel Judicial Center is more than a building. It is a monument to the rule of law, a symbol of justice for all, and a promise to you and to the citizens of this great state. I hope that you look at this new building as it graces at land as landscape with pride and a hope for all that is to come just as I do. The recent move from our old building on Mitchell Street just around the corner was a time to reflect on where we have been and where we are headed in a new building that is constructed to last for 100 years. We are not where we once were. When the courtroom that we just vacated was dedicated in 1956, a photo captured the court's seven justices standing at the bench where our court has set, sat since that time. The photo shows them leaning down from that familiar bench, shaking hands with former Governor, then Governor Marvin Griffin, and former Governor Herwin Townwich. I was struck by that photo because all seven justices were white men, not very much even in terms of height or weight, sort of like judicial rockets. Our court is different now, and I was also struck by the speeches of that day. Former Governor Herwin Townwich stated that he took comfort knowing that the Georgia Supreme Court refuses to bow subpoinally before those who had substituted their own twisted notions of right and wrong for law and precedent. The speakers praised and urged Georgia's highest court to stand firm against the usurpation of local authority. They were talking about Brown versus the Board of Education and the force desegregation that was being imposed by the United States Supreme Court and federal authorities. They spoke that day about upholding the rule of law just as we do here today. So we know from our history that we, as judges and lawmakers, have not always gotten it right. That reminder urges us to remain vigilant, realizing that the divisions of the past could easily impede our efforts to move forward together. My friend and colleague on the Supreme Court Justice Robert Bitton recently said, we can't let the evils of our yesterdays use up our tomorrows. As a people, we have more in common than things that separate us. So how will we do in this new building that has been designed to last 100 years? On the last day of oral arguments in our old building on November 7, 2019, I asked the question, how has that building served us since it opened for business in 1956? I hope that 100 years from now, someone will ask that question of our new building. My hope in prayer is that the answer will be that because the people who work there lived up to the highest deals, ideals and the rule of law and the bodies and our new building expires, that they'll be able to speak well of our role in a new building. And I am confident that we are off to a fine start. I have the privilege of working alongside some of the best legal minds and the most committed public servants and the finest men and women who I've ever worked with. Presiding Justice David Namius, Justice Robert Bitton, Justice Keith Blackwell, Justice Michael Boggs, Justice Nell's Peterson, Justice Sarah Warren, Justice Charlie Bethel, and Justice John Elenton. I am so grateful for them and for my friends and colleagues on the Corps of Appeals, as well as the many dedicated and hardworking judges across this great state. Folks, I'm proud to say that we have a professional statewide judiciary. When Justice Clarence Thomas of the United States Supreme Court came earlier this month, to help dedicate our new building, he said that upholding and protecting the rule of law takes great courage and is not for the faint of heart, as it often leads to unpopular decisions. I assure you today that Georgia's judges are men and women of great courage and discipline, and together they filled me with a certainty that we can and will do better both in the immediate and distant future. As with Indian Denver however, there are challenges ahead for the bar and the judicial system, and we will need your help in meeting them head on. We must continue to do better to ensure that all Georgia's citizens, rich and poor, have access to justice. Six years ago in giving this annual state of the judiciary address, then Chief Justice Hugh Thompson pronounced that Georgia's judicial system was sound and strong, but then he added for those who can afford a lawyer. Too many of our citizens cannot afford legal representation in civil matters. Our economy has continued to improve. Georgia's poverty rate has dropped to 14.3%, but it remains higher than the United States average according to the US Census Bureau. Today, more than one and one half million Georgians live below the poverty level, defined as a family of four that earns no more than $26,200 per year. But even those of middle income have difficulty affording lawyers. And as Chief Justice Thompson pointed out, they too encounter numerous legal problems. They include the mom and pop grocery store owner with a contract to speak. The father dying from cancer who must finalize guardianships for his young children. Our wounded warriors returning from battle who can't access the disability benefits our government has promised. And our elderly citizens who have numerous legal needs including the fundamental needs to protect their own safety and health. In the criminal context, citizens are afforded representation regardless of their ability to pay. But in civil matters such as these, they are not. In the face of these needs, our courts have seen a growing number of people who are representing themselves. Today, the number of self-represented litigants in Georgia coming to our courts has reached well over one million. When people represent themselves their unfamiliarity with the law and court procedures, often results in frustration for all involved, rescheduled and protracted hearings, and other inefficiencies that consume valuable state resources and local resources as well. Our legal system is an adversarial system. People win and people lose. Citizens who represent themselves more often will lose. I want to tell you today about an exciting evolution that's beginning to take hold in our courts around Georgia and across the nation. We have a system of law libraries in this state. Historically, law libraries were places where judges and lawyers went to do legal research. For generations, students of the law has sat amongst rows of legal opinions and writings bound up in books as they learn the intricacies of the law. During my time as a law student and in the early years as I practiced law, those books were my constant companion, or at least they should have been. That paradigm has quickly faded and many law libraries today sit all but abandoned as monuments to legal tomes void of lawyers. Today, legal professionals do their research at their desk in a digital world where libraries come to life at their fingertips with a keyboard. Today, just about the only people who go into law libraries are non-lawyers. In 2018, the National Center for State Courts selected the Dirty County Law Library as a pilot legal self-help project, one of seven states chosen to advance the goal of providing civil justice for all. Under the leadership of Chief Judge Willie Lockett, today, Dirty County operates a law library self-help center in Albany, assisting in average of 40 self-represented litigants each day. As a regional project, it has assisted people from more than 91 Georgia counties. A survey of judges familiar with that project showed that 100% found itself represented litigants assisted by the project took up less court time and resources than those who did not receive help. Within a month, Fulton County Superior Court will unveil its state-of-the-art Justice Resource Center. This center under the leadership of former Chief Judge Robert McBerney and current Chief Judge Christopher Brasher will offer thousands of self-represent litigants, a one-stop shop where they can come and get help to navigate the legal complex process. The idea of the center came several years ago when the court administrators, one day, noticed a clearly battered woman carrying a baby with some difficulty. They could see that she needed help, but they realized that to get help first, she would need to go and do the law library and do her own legal research and then go to a separate building to get a temporary protective order, all with a baby in tow. Now, the Fulton County Law Library, its Family Information Center and other court services are being relocated together in one room. And as Chief Brasher said, we don't want people just casting about in a complex system not knowing what to do. The Fulton Computers will offer how-to videos covering topics such as how-to file for divorce or respond to an eviction notice. At the Justice Resource Center, they will be able to schedule appointments with attorneys from Atlanta Legal A who are under contract with the county. They will get help filling out forms, forms to petition for legitimation, divorce, child support, or child custody. And those who do not speak English will receive language assistance. Last year, over 3,500 citizens filed applications for temporary protective orders in Fulton County, approximately 90% of them did so without lawyers. In addition, Chief Judge Brasher said that court officials started noticing that many times the victims of domestic violence were followed into court by their abusers. So they create a special protected area in the Judicial Resource Center for those victims and their children that can only be accessed by a card key. Court administrators' ad vision that victims of elder abuse will also be able to take refuge in this locked space. The evolution of stagnant law libraries into vital self-help resource centers already has a partial funding base. Law libraries are largely funded through assessed court fees, a portion which goes into each county's law library fund. Funds available to larger counties are much greater than those available to Georgia's smaller, more rural counties. Yet a number of our smaller counties have no lawyers at all, and they too could benefit from a regional self-help resource center. And a self-help video produced in North Georgia can easily be made available and be just as helpful to self-represented litigants in South Georgia. As head of Georgia's judicial branch, I'm asking my colleague, Justice Charlie Bethel, along with Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McMurney to lead an ad hoc committee that will explore and promote best practices for refashioning law libraries across the state to meet today's needs. Self-help resource centers such as those in Fulton and Dardi counties have the potential to embody the new role of Georgia's law libraries. A place where citizens will gain greater access to our legal system. Technology can help us ensure access to justice in Georgia. Already it is helping bring efficiency and cost savings in our courts. Thanks to your legislation just over a year ago, mandatory electronic filing went into effect statewide in our state and superior courts. And I can report to you today that the sky did not fall. Other than daily hiccups, we are up and running across the state without major difficulties. I'm not hearing any huge outcries and I consider that to be a good thing. We've made great progress, but we must not rest on our laurels or we could wind up generations behind. Technology changes so fast that we must continue to innovate and improve. We know that technology holds promise for helping us be more efficient in our work and for helping us better serve underserved communities. But we also know that technology brings new challenges. In the last two years we have seen a growing number of ransomware attacks on governmental agencies in Georgia. These attacks have heightened the need for cybersecurity in all three branches of government including the judicial branch. Ransomware attacks use malware to lock out users, generally under a demand for payment. I liken it to having your keys stolen from your car. You can still see your car, but you can't get into it to drive it. You needed the encryption code to unlock the system, but the thieves have that code and they demand money to give it up. As you know, in March of 2018, the City of Atlanta suffered a massive cyber attack. The Georgia Department of Public Safety was also a target, and there have been others. Last June, the Georgia Administrative Office of the Courts was a target of a major ransomware attack. Some courts that had their electronic file saved on the AOC server lost access to all their electronic records. In entire case files dating back 20 years and more were gone in an instant. Reconstruction and recovery has been an ongoing effort in many of those courts. Much of the judiciary survived the attack unscathed, but this is the future operating environment for all of us. I want to thank you for your support thus far in helping the judiciary protect itself against future attacks. Last fall, I established a committee chair by Judge Christian Coomer of the Georgia Court of Appeals to identify, mitigate, and ensure against risks and vulnerabilities in the courts. The Cybersecurity Committee includes and engages cybersecurity experts, physical security professionals, lawyers who specialize in privacy and data security, judges, and clerks of court. My expectation is that the committee will help to produce tools and solutions that will safeguard the vital information, the vital information, the judges and trusts to their judicial branch of government. Based on this work, our cybersecurity committee will be making specific recommendations in the near future. For protecting the judicial branch of government, we will be in touch with you in the next year with how you can help. In addition to these systemic problems, another challenge we face in the judiciary is how to respond to individuals with serious mental health problems. I want to applaud Governor Kemp and you, the Georgia legislature, for creating the Behavioral Health, Interfation, and Reform Commission. We, in the judiciary, pledge our support and willingness to work diligently with the governor, with you, and with the commission to reduce the number of people with Behavioral Health issues who wind up in our jails and prisons. Under House Bill 514, the commission has been given a broad and sweeping mission to conduct a comprehensive review of the Behavioral Health System in Georgia and make recommendations for reforming it. Among the charges, the commission has been asked to identify the ways Behavioral Health problems lead to entanglement with the criminal justice system. Four judges serve on that 24-member commission. Supreme Court Justice Michael Boggs chairs the commission's subcommittee on mental health courts and corrections, which is charged with reviewing the impact Behavioral Health issues have on the court system and correctional system. Chief Judge Brian Amara of the Henry County Superior Court chairs the commission's subcommittee on involuntary commitments. The work of the commission is the next logical step as we strive to work unseasonally to improve our criminal justice system. We know that people with mental illness and co-occurring substance use disorders are overrepresented in our jails. Taking Macon Bibb County as an example, 18% of the jail population is made up of people with a serious mental health diagnosis compared to 5% of the general population. Those with the mental health diagnosis stay in jail nearly twice as long and have nearly three times the recidivism rate. Our judges have responded. In just five years, the number of participants served by Georgia's mental health courts has more than doubled from 896 in 2014 to 2112 participants in 2019. Under our leadership, judges have led the charge towards mental health courts and reduced recidivism save and save taxpayer dollars. For every $1 invested in mental health court in Georgia, there is a savings of $6.03. We understand that it is important to address behavioral health problems before they manifest themselves in the criminal justice system, and I am confident that this is what the commission will help us to do. As a judge, as a father, and as a leader in young life ministries, I believe we must particularly focus on our young people. We have the means to detect when young men and young women are on a path towards trouble with the law, whether due to problems at home or at school, mental health issues or drug addictions. The challenge continues to be whether we will wait until they enter the criminal justice system before we tackle those problems in a holistic way. As the state turns its attention to criminal gain activity, I encourage us to also pay attention to identifying juveniles going down this destructive path so we can steer them in a different direction. In Fulton County, district attorney Paul Howard and public defender Vernon Pitts, often adversaries in the criminal justice process are working together with the juvenile court. To identify 13 to 16 year olds.

who have already committed three nonviolent offenses. They intend to intervene in their lives before they graduate into the criminal, to adult, into the adult criminal justice system. So far, they have identified about 52 kids who fit their parameters. The goal is to introduce them to a life that's different, a different direction and a different path, called Level Up. The program is modeled after a similar program operating in Chicago and New York. Once the program is fully operational, their staff will pick up the young people each morning and take them to school. After school staff will take them to a special center that is funded by the Atlanta Police Foundation where they'll be fed. Tutors will help them with their schoolwork and they'll participate in sports and other activities until eight or nine o'clock at night. And then staff will return them to their homes at a time where a parent is more likely to be there to help supervise. The program staff will visit homes to see what's really going on. And about 11 churches have volunteered to provide mentors to spend time with these young people as they navigate life's issues. Kids who join gangs most often are looking for family, for belonging. In Chicago where the program has been up and running, the recidivism rate has gone down by 73%. In New York, it has dropped by 69%. I believe that this type of program can make a difference in our communities, keep kids out of gangs and put them on a better path towards a life of meaning and purpose. APPLAUSE In addition to dealing with the behavioral health of people coming into our criminal justice system, I'm also concerned about the mental health of our judges and our lawyers. Our own dirty secret is that the job of dealing with society's problems in addition to our own sometimes takes its toll. We are often not healthy ourselves. I commend the State Bar Georgia and our law schools for reaching out to lawyers and law students and offering confidential services and counseling to those who need help with depression, stress, alcohol, drug abuse and psychological issues. Mental health issues affect us all either directly or indirectly. In April, our Chief Justice's Commission on Professionalism will convene a suicide awareness program. It will be a statewide conversation among our entire legal community, Sally Quillian Yates, who lost her father to suicide will moderate the program. This is an issue we cannot afford to ignore. We in the Appellate Courts were hit particularly hard last year with the loss of our own judge, Stephen Goss, on the Court of Appeals, who died from suicide. Ironically, Judge Goss founded the State's first felony mental health court in Dirty County in 2002. Judge Goss' death last summer reminds us all that we cannot assume we always know what's going on in the personal lives of others. It reminds us of how important it is to reach out and care for one another and learn specific ways we can respond to people we suspect might be considering taking their own lives. It also reminds us that we as a society still struggle to lift a stigma of mental illness that stands as a barrier, preventing so many from getting the help they need. Hopefully in the next 100 years, we will do better. I am confident that we will. APPLAUSE I began today's address by telling you that we are not where we were in 1956. We are a different court now than we in our first court convened in the building that we have left behind. We are a different state. It has become customary during addresses such as these to point to the gallery and recognize someone special who is worthy of special recognition. I have intentionally refrained from doing that. Today, rather than point to someone in the gallery, I point to someone who is seated right here in front with the rest of my colleagues. No one personifies Georgia's growth and evolution towards a professional judiciary better than just Robert Benham of the Supreme Court of Georgia. APPLAUSE APPLAUSE As I said at our dedication ceremony earlier this month, he is the father of the modern court, a court that is truly dedicated to the principle that all men and women are equal and stand equal in the eyes of the law. The day after tomorrow marks the last day Justice Benham will serve as a judge of his beloved Georgia after nearly 36 years on the Corva Peals and the Georgia Supreme Court. That means, folks, that he has endured 32 state of the judiciary addresses. LAUGHTER Having personally inflicted four of them upon you in his own right when he was chief justice, Justice Benham grew up in the hills of North Georgia in Cardiffville where he still lives. As a boy, he saw his father cry for the first time. After the family was turned away from the amusement park called Story Land, they had seen it advertised on TV, but his father hadn't realized that the park was for whites only. As a young man, Justice Benham worked in state government for the first time as an intern for then Governor Lester Maddox. We know of Governor Maddox's segregationist history, but as is his way, the young Robert Benham found a way to build a bridge and grew to be respected by the governor. In 1989, then Governor Joe Frank Harris appointed him as the first African American to sit on this state's highest court. In Justice Benham's own words, here's how he described that day. I thought that moment represented not necessarily a remarkable accomplishment on my part, but a remarkable accomplishment on the state's part. That's typical of Justice Benham. He often endured walking into rooms where people closely assessed whether to take him seriously. He ever came doubts by employing two primary tools. First, he was always nice. And second, he was always bigger than the situation. He took the high road, never giving tit for tat, striving for common ground. He suffered slights gracefully, never lost his temper, never raised his voice, never took things personally. He remained singularly focused on his goal and always moved forward. And then, he was always a great person. Justice Benham is a pillar in our state's history. And one of my greatest highlights in life has been the privilege of having served with him on this court. The last day that Justice Benham presided over oral arguments, we later celebrated with staff and the entire court. His wife, Nell, was there, and their two children were there, and the justices and judges were there. And he said that she was very proud of him for all his accomplishments. And she thanked us. But most of all, she wanted us to know what a good husband and a father he'd always been. He is truly a good man, she said. Justice Benham, we will never forget you. The state will never forget you. I will never forget you. Now, your wife is here today. I know you tried to leave her behind. But she is here. And I ask you now, Ms. Nell and Justice Benham, to both stand so we can thank you once more for your great service. Thank you. Thank you. Lastly, ladies and gentlemen of the General Assembly, I want to personally thank you for the partnership and cooperation that we have with you for the cause of justice. It is an honor to serve with each one of you as we work together to hammer out these tough but meaningful issues. God bless you all and may God bless the great state of Georgia. Thank you. Thank you, Chief Justice, for those words. Thank you for your reflection. But thank you so much for your vision forward. Thank you very much. Mr. Sergeant Arms, please ask court the Chief Justice, the Justice of the Supreme Court and the Judges of the Court of Appeals from the Chamber at this time. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. This time I'd like to recognize the President, Proteem, for a motion.

Dr. Delphine Head is our Doctor of the Day. She's a family practice doctor. She got a degree from the South Alabama College of Medicine and completed her internship at Morehouse School of Medicine. She has chosen to be a family practitioner because she just loves taking care of families. So with that please help me to welcome the Doctor of the Day. Thank you representative Bruce and thank all of you for the warm welcome. It is an honor to be a part of this great tradition and service Doctor of the Day. I am employed for the Southeast Permanente Medical Group and we care for Kaiser Permanente members. While some of you may not be familiar with our practice we are the largest physician-owned physician-led medical group in Atlanta. I and the other 800 members of my group work with you not an insurance company to make your care decisions. This has been our model for 70 years and I'm proud to be a part of that tradition. As an Atlanta native I have passed this building many many times. I have lost count. So it's an honor to actually be able to serve in this building and it means more than words can say. Thank you again for your warm welcome and I look forward to serving you and you'll be excited to know there's no co-payments, no co-payments in the day. No co-payments. Thank you. We are now going on to the rules calendar going on to the rules calendar. The clerk will read the caption to House Bill 799.

House bill 799 by R. S. of Blackman in the 146th Meantime on NAC to amend Article 3A, Chapter 5, of a Title 40 that fiscal to Georgia and inted in relating to suspension of license for being in control of a moving vehicle under the influence of a controlled substance. This bill I refer to the Committee on Judiciary non-civil that committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes Chairman Blackman to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Fellow members, bring before you today House bill 799, which would give judges the same level of discretion with a DUI drug conviction as they now have in a DUI alcohol conviction with regards to a driving permit on a temporary basis. And just for a little bit of background, constituent had an issue regarding a prescription drug that she took as prescribed was picked up the following morning on a DUI drug charge. And she drives as a part of her job. And she found out later that she'd been drinking, she would have been allowed potentially by the judge at his discretion a permit to drive on a temporary basis. But under this particular charge, she was not. So this bill is designed to correct that. I do want to thank the PAC and the criminal defense attorneys for vetting this and also Chairman Setsler and Chairman Abstration for the necessary vetting at the committee level along with the bill sponsors. Mr. Speaker, that's the bill in a nutshell. I'd be happy to answer any questions if there are any. I'm sorry. You have a question if you care to yield. Yes, sir, I will yield. Chair recognizes Chairman Abstration to your left for a question. Mr. Chairman, heels. I do, sir. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your presentation. It's similar mode to the minority leader's question from yesterday. Will you please confirm to the House that House Bill 799 in no way impacts the tax code? It's such as confirmed, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for the question. Thank you. Good, Bill. You have no further questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We'll ask for the body's favorable consideration. You'll the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of House Bill 799? Will vote aye. Those opposed to vote no in the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines. From the passage of House Bill 799, the eyes are 159. The nays are zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 521. House Bill 521, motion of gains, the 117th and others to be entitled to an act to amend article 2 of chapter 11 of Title 43. The official go to George Antony relating the licenses for the practice of dentistry this bill ever referred to the committee on Health and Human Services. That committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative gains to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. House Bill 521 allows non-Georgia licensed dentist and dental hygienist to apply for a temporary limited volunteer license to practice dentistry in George under the direct supervision of a Georgia licensed dentist at free and charitable events. These licenses are valid for non-Georgia licensed dentists and dental hygienists who are in good standing with their home state and for a period of up to five days as long as care is provided on a volunteer basis and free to the patients. These dentists and dental hygienists will be overseen by Georgia dentists with a ratio of up to four to one non-Georgia dentist to dental hygienist to George dentist. We work with the Georgia Dental Association to craft language to the best support low income patients across the state. The dental association does such great work by providing these charity clinics across Georgia. For low income patients dentistry is often one of the greatest challenges and this legislation will provide one more avenue to provide quality care free of charge. To speak I would be happy to answer any questions. You have a couple of questions if you care to yield. I will. Chair recognizes Chairman Hawkins, do you write for a question? Does General Neal? I do. With this bill, this piece of legislation you have increased access to health care for poor Georgians. It will. Thank you, sir. Thank you for the question. Do you further yield? I do for one more question. Chair recognizes representative Cannon to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Do you yield? I do. Can you speak to how this will affect pregnant people across the state of Georgia? Well, the legislation would allow pregnant or otherwise low income patients to get this care at these chip free and charitable events across the state. Do you further yield? I do. And so these are generally the services that are taken care of by pregnancy Medicaid or just pregnancy Medicaid not covered this? These charitable clinics will be for low income patients who meet them. In Georgia code, there is a list of what would qualify for low income patients. And I'm happy to walk through all the qualifications if that would be helpful. But this legislation will apply to those patients. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the will. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair hears none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee's substitute? The Chair hears none, the Committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the Committee? Which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair hears none? The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye? Those opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 521. The eyes are 160, the nays are zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. The clerk will read the caption to House Bill 893. What purpose does Chairman Blackman rise? Mr. Speaker, I'd like to move that House Bill 715 be returned to the Ways and Means Committee. You withdraw that for now? I do, sir. All right. You've got great potential. House Bill 893 by the motion of Gamble, the 15th and others to be entitled to amend Code Section 331117 in the fiscal of Georgia and Tadya relating the special insurance fund. Fraud fund. So as to reduce the frequency of assessments, this bill ever referred to the Committee on Insurance, that committee recommends that this bill do pass. They recognize this representative Gamble to present the bill, just a minute gentlemen. Evidently, some of you don't wish to hear the presentations of the bills. That certainly has a great believer in liberty. That's your privilege. But there might be those that do. So the chair is going to ask that if you're in the chamber, they see it in give respect to the members in the well as you would like to have if you were in the well on your bill. The really novel concept, chair recognizes representative Gamble to present the bill. Well, thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the House. I stand before you today with House Bill 893. This is a bill that the Department of Insurance brought to us requesting a change to be made in the wording for the official Code of Georgia to reflect the current practice that they are already doing at the Department of Insurance with regards to collection of the premium fee for the special Fraud fund. It will go from being collected quarterly to annually. That's all this does. The fee is still collected. It's still the same amount. But rather than collecting it quarterly, it will just be annually. And I'd be happy to take any questions if there are any, Mr. Speaker. Do you have questions if you care to yield? I will take one, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes representative Stovall to your left for a question. That's the gentleman here. Yes, I do. Could these funds, the Fraud funds, be used for consumers whose insurance confidence placed the Fraud at home repair companies that are not registered with the Secretary of State that they placed them on their insurance website. Could these funds be used for that as well? I'm sure the general lady knows what she speaks. As far as what this bill does and the usage of those funds, I know that Commissioner King is with us today and he'd be happy to answer this specific question. But all this does is just change the collection of these funds which are currently being collected in the code from quarterly to annually. That's all this bill does. Mr. Speaker. You have another question if you care to yield. I yield the well. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of House Bill 893, will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines. On the passage of House Bill 893, the eyes are 164. The nasor zero this bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Chair, I'm sorry for what purpose does Chairman Blackman rise? Make a motion. State your motion. I'd like to move that House Bill 715 be recommitted to the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Speaker. Obviously my roommate has rubbed off on me a little bit with regard to these type of procedural issues. Minority leader might object to that. He was expecting to vote on it today, weren't you? Chairman has moved that House Bill 715 be recommitted to the Ways and Means Committee, clerk will read the caption. House Bill 715, members of the Blackman, 146 of those will be titled an act of event article on Chapter 13, Title 48 of the fiscal to Georgia and it's actually in the general provisions regarding specific business and occupational taxes. On the gentleman's motion that House Bill 715 be recommitted to the Ways and Means Committee, is their objection? Is their objection? The chair here is none and it is so ordered. Okay, we're going on now to morning orders. Once again, not trying to influence your decision, but if you choose not to do one, that just means we get to go to lunch sooner. Chair recognizes for a morning order, Chairman Nicks, Representative Collins and Representative Cook. They wave, Chair recognizes. Chairman Martin for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I just want the members of the higher ed committee and the higher ed appropriations committee to know that the independent colleges are down in 125 of the capital. They may still have some lunch in there earlier today. They had plenty of lunch, but it may be gone. Not by on the way. Also we have a higher ed meeting at one o'clock. Thank you. Chair recognizes Representative McCloud for a morning order. Chair neglected to say earlier, I will now one minute each for morning orders. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and big up to my colleagues. For my black history moment, I will be telling you about five things that African inventors did at that change the world. First speech, the first words ever spoken by humans occurred in sub-Sahurban Africa during the middle stone age. This is supported by genetic, archaeology, peontology and more evidence. The oldest known possible mathematical object is the Lombando bones, which was discovered in the Lombimbo mountains of Swaziland, dated approximately 35,000 BC. Many of the math concepts we used today in schools came from the ancient Egyptians. Evidence suggests that ancient Africa sailed to South America and Asia hundreds of years before the Europeans. The propaganda that Europeans were the first to sail in the Americas. Here's to Africa, the birthplace of human race. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Chair recognizes Representative Dubnik for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The hour is late, but the subject is important. I'm here today to recognize my favorite constituent from the 29th district. Last Thursday, the Gainesville J.C. presented their annual Young Man and Young Woman Award, a tradition that goes back to 1945. This award is given to someone who has passionately dedicated themselves to our community and recognize those who believe that service to humanity is the best work of life. This year's Young Woman was described as kind, caring, compassionate and loving. She's an entrepreneur, a sister, a daughter, a mother to two wonderful little boys, and a wife to the person who is speaking these words to you now. My wife, Katie, is so deserving of this award, and I'm here today to tell you how proud I am. However, Mr. Speaker, I was put in a pickle. The Governor Kemp and Senator Miller both sent resolutions congratulating her, yet I had no such resolution. So I'm here today in front of God country and the Georgia House of Representatives to tell my wife how proud I am of her. And furthermore, I want to tell her thank you for putting up with me since 1999. And Mr. Speaker today is our 15th wedding anniversary, so I'll simply tell her that I love her and I hope she's watching. Thank you. Chair, recognize as Chairman Pruitt for a morning order. Chairman Pruitt. Chair recognizes Representative Scott for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today we recognize rule health day at the Capitol. I believe we have some folks up in the gallery. Thank you. Thank you to all of those that care about our rural communities and their health. According to Georgia Board of Health Care Workforce, 78 counties in Georgia have no general surgeons and what are we doing about it? I'd like to share what Georgia's only state public medical school, the medical college of Georgia and a Gusta University are doing. A Gusta University has a rural surgery program where it allows the rural surgery programs to have more hands on and they are delivering surgical services into other places besides a Gusta. And this is attracting more doctors and new doctors to open their practices in rural Georgia. They see a higher volume and a much lower acuity cases to help them train better. The medical college of Georgia 3-plus programs allows family practitioners to graduate in three years, go immediately into residency and they will be eligible for loan forgiveness. This is growing our workforce of medical care in the rural communities and the rural emergency room. They have carts that are prepared by the college that has electronic devices where testing can be done and they can actually five different communities and ER rooms have mobile carts where these are in Wills Memorial Hospital in Washington, a manual medical center in Swainsboro, Washington County Regional Medical Center in Sandersville, Miller County Hospital in Cullquette and Chris Regional Hospital in Cordillo. These teleelectronics allow those ER doctors to have the experts on the other end of that electronic hookup. Thank you to all those helping south sources rural communities. Thank you.
