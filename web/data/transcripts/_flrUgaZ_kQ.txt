after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
Our chaplain this afternoon will be introduced by the lady from the 56th House District
representing Mission Mainter, representing Mainter.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I am so happy to introduce to you today our chaplain, Rabbi Medwin.
She is a rabbi at the temple, which is right at the tip of my district.
She's a native of Memphis, Tennessee, which is where I grew up for a little bit.
A lot of people may not know that.
kindergarten through third grade, I was in Memphis, Tennessee.
My mom was an air traffic controller.
But Rabbi Medwin has three children,
and I initially met her with the Ross Child Social Justice
Center.
She is going to grace us with a word, but before I go on,
I want to just let you know a little bit about her.
She attended the University of Texas in Austin
and Hebrew University in Jerusalem for undergraduate studies,
earning degrees in Middle Eastern studies,
and honors and humanities.
She was ordained on the Los Angeles campus
of Hebrew Union College in May of 2010.
While there, she received a Master's of Hebrew letters
and a Master's in Jewish education.
Let us please welcome Rabbi Medwin.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
I have the honor of serving the temple, which is a synagogue here in Midtown, Atlanta,
under the senior leadership of Rabbi Peter Berg, who sends his regards along with the entire
clergy team and staff and community here in Atlanta.
Thank you so much for the honor of getting to speak in front of this esteemed assembly
today.
And special thanks to Speaker Burns and to Representative Maynard for this invitation
today.
The second day of your legislative session, 2024.
And for the ways that this assembly has been supportive of the Jewish community, especially
in the wake of October 7th, and your stand against anti-Semitism, along with Islamophobia
and all forms of hate, we are in your debt.
Thank you so much.
It is because of the ways that this assembly works when it's at its best, robust debate,
collegial respect, a thirst for solutions that include compromise and inclusion of diversity
of ideas that we live into the fullest potential of this great state of Georgia.
And I know that this process of argue, of debate, is not always an easy one.
For most people, disagreement can be uncomfortable at best, and frankly, most of us think it's
not all that fun.
I remember when I was a rabbi back in Los Angeles,
a friend of mine who was a Catholic priest,
came into the synagogue to teach some classes.
And he was pretty sure he confided in me later
that for the first couple of months,
not a soul in their liked him very much.
Because they kept arguing with him
about every little point he was making.
He was a custom you see to teaching in churches
where people sat politely and they listened nicely.
And it wasn't until he sat at the rabbi's Passover
satir dinner table, where he witnessed this process
of arguing and debating happening in front of his eyes
between everybody there.
And even the rabbi's children were asking the rabbi,
their father, all kinds of questions
arguing every little point.
He realized that actually people in the synagogue
liked him very much, that the arguing was a form of engagement
and approval and a way to express care about the ideas
that were being expressed.
He learned an important point.
That arguing doesn't have to be mean,
or it doesn't mean something bad.
In fact, arguing is a form of clarifying our intentions
and ideas, a sign of engagement, and a sacred act
when it's done well.
The Jewish tradition teaches there are two kinds
of arguments in this world, an argument that is
for the sake of heaven and an argument
that is not for the sake of heaven.
An argument whose point is to build the future
and one whose point is to cut off the future.
An argument that sharpens ideas on both sides
and one that clouties and dulls.
Every argument for the sake of heaven is destined to endure,
but if it is a trivial or misguided or abusive argument,
it will quickly become a footnote in history.
Examples of this kind of argument are found throughout Jewish tradition, but especially
in the form of two rabbis whose names are Hillel and Shamai.
Hillel and Shamai lived about 2,000 years ago, and these two rabbis could fight like the
Dickens.
For generations of their students afterwards, they are arguing continued each house challenging
one another relentlessly when it came to ethics and morals in the ways they understood
of God speaking to them in their lives.
During one particularly fierce argument,
an argument that lasted for three years,
finally a heavenly voice came down and said,
you and you are both representing the living words of God.
But the law is like the house of Hillel.
You see, both of their arguments were actually right,
God thought.
Both of them made wonderful arguments and points.
They had good intentions.
They were fighting with truthfulness
and with integrity with one another.
But God knew eventually the people needed a final answer.
And so the law went according to the House of Hillel
because according to our tradition,
Hillel was the one who was able not just to teach
their own ideas but also to teach their opponent's ideas.
In fact, they taught their opponent's ideas first
before teaching and arguing their own points.
In other words, they argued better with a higher quality of argument.
As an aside, we learn later that though these houses fall with unparalleled ferocity,
they still broke bread together in the evenings, and their children still married into each
other's families.
They remained humans to one another beyond the arguments about which they felt so intensely.
of the state of Georgia. Here at the beginning of your legislative session, you will argue
with your colleagues. This is not a bug in our system. This is actually a feature.
Arguing is not a sign of disunity or dysfunction. It is a sign that you are engaged in that
you care. It is evidence that there are values and ideas and people's lives that you care
about and that are on the line in this room. And you were elected to fight for those ideas
and values and the people you represent.
But there are arguments that are for the sake of heaven
and there are arguments that, for their partisanship
or falseness or pettiness, will soon be footnotes in history.
There are ways to argue and fight that preserve the humanity
of your opponent and there are ways to fight that dehumanize
as we know and disregard.
It takes a sense of humility to learn more
about your opponent's argument and understand it from a place
of principle and integrity, and it takes a sense of patience and a willingness to engage
in issues to create legislation that will tackle our state's most entrenched problems.
And so I want to invite you now to please rise as we offer a prayer on this opening day
of your second day of session, God, who blessed our ancestors with a fire in their bellies
to fight for your sake, we pray for all of those in this chamber today.
We pray that their arguments ring clear and true, sharpened by their opponents' rebuttals.
We pray that they stand for what they believe is right and truthful, for themselves,
for their constituents, and especially for those who are the most vulnerable to the outcomes
of their decisions.
We pray that there is room also to tolerate someone else's principled position.
We pray their willingness to work together with those who do not share their party or opinion
will stay strong.
that civility and the ability to argue well is a cornerstone of our democracy.
And we pray that their friendships across the aisle will strengthen them and nourish
them and encourage them to argue better.
For not many people get to sit in these seats and know the job as they do.
The truth is every single one of these legislators God needs the other to argue with during the
day and to break bread with when the day is done. As the famous Jewish philosopher and
doctor, my monodies once said, God, we pray. He said, I'll destroy my enemies by converting
them to friends. May they find wonderful opponents and one another with ideas that stretch
their own imaginations. May God bless you each as you come into this place with health.
May God bless you as you take your leave here each day in health.
May God bless your work as arguments for the sake of goodness,
wholeness, and righteousness for all Georgians.
And we say together, amen.
Please remain standing for the pledge of allegiance.
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America
and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation
under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.
The doorkeepers, you can unlock the doors.
Members, you may greet the rabbi in the south any room and have a photo opportunity.
You may do that now if you so like.

Members, we do have a doctor of the day downstairs that representative Sheila Jones has invited
from the 60th.
Thank you, Sheila, for inviting the doctor of the day.
Dr. Walton McClellan is downstairs, and this is Dr. Walton right here, so maybe he's
watching.
So let's give him a round of applause as a thank you for being here and taking care of
us today.
We represent you, Jones, let him know that we really appreciate him being here.
Thanks for that.

like that, link about it.
Because I hadn't answered it, probably.
Yeah, I wouldn't have heard if it was in the age of that.
I don't know if I can get that out of here.
But no, I'll find that out.
You see where I'm coming from?
I don't know if that ain't it.
I'll find that out there.
Thank you very much.
Members, we're moving on to afternoon orders.
So if I can have your attention, it'd be nice if you gave your attention to the member
in the well.
Members will please take your seats or head out to the any room.
You can't pass legislation on the second day, I don't know what y'all are doing.
You get ready though, right Al?
So here's our deal.
We have 15 minutes for afternoon orders.
I'm going to be generous.
We have one, two, three, four, eight of you.
We're going to take these in order of reverence and imported.
So we're going to begin with Chairman Knight, Chairman Matthews, and the Spalding Gut
delegation, if you will.
Members of your rise, and give the member in the well, your attention.
The members in the well, your attention, would be much appreciated.
Good afternoon.
We stand here with you today for a solemn reason on December 28, 2023.
The life of Sergeant Mark McIntyre was cut short.
He exemplified the verse, John 1513, greater love have no man than this, that a man lay
down his life for his friends.
He was an Army veteran, a law enforcement officer who gave up a more prestigious role because
he wanted to community police.
He wanted to be on the road so he could touch people that were in need and be able to
help them at that time.
It's heartbreaking to stand here because he was so loved.
I don't know if we can convey that to you, but there was a church full of people who
wept for the many things he did because he was just a good person.
As Beth said, it was a very, very sad day for all those who knew Mark.
I think he was larger than life.
And that's what you got from the funeral when we were there.
And all of the people that were just telling all some stories.
You know, a lot of times we look at the heart of a person who would take a life.
But in this case, it was just very, very...
It brought joy to the heart to know of that man and what joy he brought, just every day
getting up wanting to service community and most of all the people.
He just loved people.
And again we want to honor his memory, his service and we're here to say how much we are
hurting for our county and also for the Spawn and County Sheriff's Department,
Sheriff Daryl Dicks and what they've gone through last week on December the 29th
when he was senselessly killed just answering a welfare check call. With that
we have a moment of silence and memory of Mark McIntyre.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you, members.
Let's recognize this Savannah Chatham delegation and the former mayor of Savannah, Representative
Edna Jackson.
if you'll please rise again for this remembrance.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
It is with sadness that I announced, on last week's Tuesday, we had the inauguration
of our mayor, Van Johnson, for the second term.
His family came all the way from New York to be a part of that celebration.
Unfortunately, on Wednesday morning, his father passed away.
I ask that you have given us a moment of silence as we know that he is in a better place
and that our mayor is going to carry on as he always has.
Thank you.
May we pray.
Thank you.
Thank you Delegation and Representative Jackson.
Chairman Jay Collins has recognized for an afternoon order.
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Many of you know today is law enforcement appreciation day in our nation.
Unfortunately, we got some really terrible news just a few weeks ago when the fraternal
order of the police released their findings from 2023. 378 peace officers were shot in the
line of duty, the highest number ever since that statistic has been recorded. 138 law enforcement
officers in our nation were ambushed in 115 separate attacks throughout our nation. This
This state lost five peace officers last year and has already lost one in the line of duty.
This house has continued to lead during my tenure here in the house and the words that
I want to use, I want to be very careful here.
Many in this chamber have continued to support law enforcement over the years.
You've shown support with your votes.
You've shown support with the way that you posture in your politics and the policy that
you stand for.
Ladies and gentlemen, in today's society, our law enforcement, our men and women are under
attack and they have been and I appreciate those men and women who serve and care that
thin blue line with them every day and stand on that thin blue line.
I just wanted to ask for a moment of silence for all of those that we lost and a moment
of respect for those who stand on that thin blue line and they protect and honor and serve
this community in this state every day and they selfishly give of their time and their
ability to protect us so please we could have a moment of silence.
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
How about representing Trayette, and you're ready?
As soon trained as recognized for an afternoon order,
you have the will.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I rise today to talk about maternal mortality here in Georgia.
Now, around the country, the rates of maternal mortality
is increasing, but unfortunately,
Georgia is leading the way.
With, on average, across the country,
around 30.2 women for every 100,000 birds,
30.2 women die from maternal mortality, but in Georgia, the rate is much higher.
Among white women, the rate is 23.3 per 100,000 births, and horrifically, among black women,
it is 48.6 per 100,000 births.
We are leading the country in maternal mortality.
And while we're leading the country in business development, we're failing the mothers in our
state.
And we need to change that.
We need to show the country how to lower maternal mortality throughout the country by showing
how we do it in the state of Georgia.
And I finished with this last tidbit of you wondering why Asians aren't listed.
And it's under 5% we do not list those statistics out of privacy concerns.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you, representatives.
You are at the well.
Let's see.
Representative Donahue and Representative Barry Fleming recognized for an afternoon order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
day on your desk, Rep. Fleming and I, we had the privilege of something I have been blessed
to do a couple times since Rep. Paul Battles was here. This is called Join Peace, My Daily
Devotion. In each one of you, I hope every day you start your day off with this. And just
to say something here, yesterday, the first day of session, choose life that you may love
the Lord your God that you may obey His voice and that you may cling to Him.
With that, an amazing aspect of God's love for us is the fact that He gives us choices.
And we make choices each and every day.
So remember that what we do affects the state of Georgia, what we do will affect our families.
However, if you spend this day and every day just getting to know the Lord, it will change
things in Georgia and in the House and Mr. Speaker I thank you and
Representative Lenin. Thank you Mr. Speaker I have in my 22 or so years down here
there's a lot of paper have been put on my desk and a lot of publications but
probably one of the most important one was ever was this one right here and I
tell you if you use it every day like it's called a daily guide it'll make
your day better I appreciate y'all letting us put it on your desk thank you
this figure. Thank you. We're grateful to you too for doing that. We appreciate it.
I'm sort of put it to use. Thank you.
Representative Jasmine Clark.
Representative Jasmine Clark.
Here she is.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
This is just a, I just wanted to remind everybody about the AI conference that is happening
this evening at 6 o'clock PM.
It is via Zoom.
Everyone in the chamber, no matter which part of your part of, everyone in the chamber
is invited to attend.
AI is something that we are all going to deal with.
And one way, some way, maybe good,
maybe bad, negative, positive, especially
as we go into election season, there
are lots of different ways that AI can be used for good
and for nefarious purposes.
And so I think it's really important
that we all be clear about what we're dealing with.
And so this AI conference will include experts
from Georgia Tech to talk about artificial intelligence.
I would love to have you all there.
Registration is open all the way to the beginning of the event.
Tonight at six o'clock, please attend.
Have a great day.
Thanks, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you, Representative Clark.
Well, we have a dynamic duo up next.
They don't have a mask or a cape, either one of them.
But they do great.
You're a dynamic duo, do they, Mr. Chairman?
Chairman McJackson and Chairman the Dean of this House, Gerald Green, the co-chairs of
the Rural Development Council for Announcement, afternoon order.

Let's hear it.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
On behalf of the House, Rural Development Council, I want to personally thank you, Mr.
Speaker, for appointing Representative McJackson on my staff as co-chairs of the Council.
I want to thank the committee that traveled and met throughout the state during the summer
and fall months on the issues that affected our rural communities.
And a big thank you to Leo Chansey for his work on putting together the summary and the
findings of the particular report that is being released today.
On the website, you will find the 2023 overview and recommendations of the Rule Development
Council.
And I can say, as we met in the different areas of the state, whether it was Farm Bureau
in Macon, Georgia, or Georgia Southern, at State Sparrow, or at the University of Georgia
that we were received well, and all of the people that presented so many different ideas,
their ideas are in the report.
If you want to read something that is about rule Georgia and the state of Georgia, please
go to the website or see me or representative Mac Jackson for this particular overview.
And Ms. Speaker, you could not have appointed a better co-chair than representative Mac Jackson
who helped me through this so much.
And also, I would be amiss if I didn't say something about Stacey Williams, my admin who
was able to do so much and make sure that the committee operated.
We've had a lot of individuals working together, but thank you, Mr. Speaker, for all your confidence and your work, and thank you to the individuals that made this a great day.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We want to thank you for the work that we did over the summer and in the interim for the role development council.
