TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good afternoon, everyone. We're going to go ahead and get started.
Thank you all for joining this afternoon. My name is Senator Nikki Merritt,
and I have the pleasure of serving as chair of the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus.
And I'm very happy to share our 2025, 2026 priorities. As you guys know, we're in the
the biennial so it's every two years so this would carry us for the next two years.
So whatever we don't have of our priorities that we don't get completed this year, we
will continue that work next year.
And at the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus, we remain committed to policies that uplift
black communities across the state.
We're fighting to expand health care access.
That is just one of our priorities, pushing for full Medicaid expansion, enhanced maternal
health programs and increased community-based mental health services. In the area of housing,
we are advocating for incentivizing affordable options, instituting, rent stabilization,
and strengthening tenant protections. On the economic front, our agenda supports black-owned
businesses through tax incentives, grants, and low interest loans, improving workers' rights,
and financial education programs. For education, our next priority, we demand equitable,
K through 12 funding, increased support for our HBCUs, expanded scholarships, and a statewide
inclusion of black history, curriculum, and public safety and justice, our next priority.
We are calling for reforms. We call for trust-based policing, comprehensive background checks,
and accountability measures to protect Black communities.
Lastly, advocacy extends to improving environmental justice,
expanding and protecting voting rights,
and preserving Black culture through dedicated funding
for the arts and community spaces.
And with that, I'm going to turn it over to our caucus
whip representative, Terry Cummings,
and she is going to share some more of our priorities.
and I'll just leave that there and I'll take this with me.
Good afternoon.
My name's Terry Cummings.
I'm State Representative for District 39,
which is Mabelton, the smirner.
And it's an honor to be the housewhip
for the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus.
Today is the 27th, of course,
and next to the last day of Black History Month.
But our priorities are in line with not only black history,
but the future.
First, our first priority is health.
Everyone deserves access to quality affordable health
care when they need it and where they need it.
That's why it is essential for the Peach Care Plus Act of 2025
for this bill to be passed to build
what advocate for full expansion of Medicaid
under the Affordable Care Act.
This legislation is SB 50 and is authored
by Leader Senator Harold Jones of the 26th District.
We also much work to combat one of the highest
maternal mortality rates in the country,
especially among black women,
by passing the Health Mother's Act.
HV 149 led by Representative Imani Barnes of the 86.
With education, the Trump administration's aggressive push for education reform threatens
to undermine access to quality education for Black youth in Georgia, proposals to cut
public funding and promote school vouchers risk reversing progress, setting our children
back instead of propelling them forward.
In contrast, state-level efforts like Senator Derek Mallow's SB65, which mandates kindergarten
for all children before beginning the first grade, and by minority leaders Senator Harold
Jones's SB54, which establishes a statewide database to track school campus safety threats
served to strengthen the very foundation that federal and local policies aimed to weaken.
more than ever we must empower our Black youth by standing up and fighting for their right for a strong and
ectoal education. With housing this is our third priority and we're clear on this. Black
Georgians have disproportionately affected by race-based housing discrimination for far too long in
this date. Under representatives Kim Skowfield's legislation, House Bill 135, the GLBC fully
backs the push among housing discrimination based on hairstyles of all things associated
with race or ethnic backgrounds. Not only will this legislation provide further safeguards
for potential homeowners in ethnic groups, but will also give our Georgians an equal shot
at becoming home owners at an affordable price.
In addition, I'm introducing legislation
that will define habitability.
And this is important because most states
defined it in their housing bills, Georgia did not.
And this definition is based on the unfederal definition.
And hopefully that will be introduced this week.
Our fourth priority is wealth.
We must always work to create wealth in the black community
because everyone knows and hand up its worth more
than a hand out.
We build wealth by creating tax incentives, grants,
and low interest loans for black owned businesses.
We expand workers' rights, protections, and industries
where black workers are underrepresented, underrepresented,
Underrepresented, I'm gonna get that word right, and overworked.
And we fund financial education programs to help build wealth through home ownership,
which is extremely important.
And relation to that, we do have a bill by representative Phil Allaleway who actually got to committee.
And that would put restrictions on these corporations coming in to buy up homes in Georgia.
Even though the natural purchase rate is 3% in the country,
and Georgia, the purchase rate is over 30%.
Why?
Because there are no restrictions to corporations coming
to Georgia and just buying up these homes.
And when you buy up these homes and you take them off the market
and you turn them into rental, you have just destroyed
anybody's chance at a first home by opportunity.
We also have representatives, the Shawn Kendrick,
who introduced House Bill A.
This bill will renew our state's investment tax credit.
We move barriers for investors
and assure transparency and finance.
Now I'm turning this over to my friend
and our vice representative, Doreen Carter.
This is gonna be good.
We're gonna do it with him.
good afternoon everyone I am Doreen Carter and I'm the state representative for
Georgia House District 93 and I have a pleasure serving as the Georgia
Legislative Black Caucus Vice Chair. So we are really excited that you are
here listening and the GLBC does plan on providing legislation in the following
areas as well. In the area of public safety and justice reform according to the
John Hopkins University, Bloomberg School of Public Health, fire arms were the leading
cause of death among children and teens in the state of Georgia in 2022.
In 2021, there were at least 185 domestic violent related homicides, 75% of which were
fire arm related.
Given this, it is imperative that we safeguard our children through supporting comprehensive
fire on programs, such as those laid out in the Mort Minority Leader's Senator,
Arizona, the second legislation SB 53 on the establishment of an education
program on safe fire on storage. Lastly, in advocacy, we must always continue to
advocate for expanding voter rights to make voting more accessible and
approachable for everyone in all zip codes. Right now, there are people trying to
take us backwards to pull us back to make believe pass that never was.
Now is the time to fight to preserve Black culture because the cuts being sent down
the pipe by the new administration will cut funding for the arts, community space and
historic landmarks.
We must not seed hard fought hard one ground to the cult to the cutters in the White House.
We must always look out for the most vulnerable among us,
and that means protecting Georgia's
from the discriminatory tactics
of a forcefully conservative legislature.
Thank you for your time,
and I will turn it back over to our chair,
Senator Nikki Merrick, for our closing remarks.
Thank you Vice Chair, woman,
Representative Carter, for those remarks,
and thank you to our Representative Terry Cummings.
In 2025, the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus is saying true to the mission by pushing
for policies that tackle deep-rooted issues affecting black communities across the state.
What we've rolled out is everything from health and housing to education, wealth, public
safety, justice reform and advocacy.
We are committed to creating a more equitable and just Georgia.
Our legislative goals are not just proposals, they are a call to action, and it's time
we break down barriers and commit to uplifting our communities and create real opportunities
for progress.
Together, we are dedicated to forging a more equitable and just Georgia for all, and we
continue to live by that mission, which is our mission, legacy in action, progress in
motion.
You can find out more about our priorities.
They will be listed on our website at GeorgiaBlackCockets.org.
We will also have our listing of all of our priorities and the legislation available to the
media.
With that, I will take questions and I did speak out about, you're talking about SB 120.
We heard that this morning and clearly that is a tack on our black institutions but just
any of our private institutions and all of our schools here.
If those of you that don't know about that bill,
but it's going to prevent any type of DI initiatives
or studies from being taught or rolled out
at all of our education.
And I believe it's public schools isn't that as well.
We is the same type of a tax that we're
seeing at the federal level.
And it is up to us to push back and fight back
on what on these very regressive policies.
I said before, Georgia and Atlanta, we are the center of civil rights here, and I'm
very disappointed to see our legislature taking up that type of policy.
Okay, all right, we're going to end.
Thank you all for joining us.
Good afternoon.
