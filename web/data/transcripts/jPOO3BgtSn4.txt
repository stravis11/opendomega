TRANSCRIPT
----------
I work in meeting, having arrived, all members please come to the floor and be prepared to take your seats.
All members, please come to the floor, Mr. Clerk, while you ring the bell.
We're going to have the morning roll call for all members if you get close to your desk.
All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber.
Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines?
All members voted.
All members voted.
Now we're good.
is voted if so to clerk where you lock the machines.
The doorkeepers, if you're pleased,
close the doors and keep them closed.
As is our custom, we will begin our day
with scripture reading and prayer by our chaplain,
after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag
of our country.
Our chaplain this morning could be a familiar face
to many of us in this room.
He's an old friend from down home
who's moved up to Chairman Bonner's district,
doing a great job over there at his church.
But I'll let Chairman Bonner do the honor
of introducing our chapter to the day.
Our chapter will be introduced by the gentleman
from the 73rd House District,
Chairman Josh Bonner.
Chairman Bonner.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Good morning colleagues. It really is an honor to introduce our
chaplain of the day. Dr. George Dillard has been the senior pastor at
Peachtree City Christian Church for over 30 years. The mission of the church is to
build relationships, introduce people to Jesus and grow disciples. And Pastor
Dillard has done that leading out through investing in our local community and
and missions abroad.
George has been a good friend to me
and so many folks in our community.
He always brings an insightful word
and is certainly no stranger to this chamber.
So at this time, I'd like to introduce
Pastor George Dillard.
Thanks for being here, David.
Good morning.
In 1978, I was asked by a number of my friends
college to take a five-day backpacking trip on the Appalachian Trail. Now I thought
that would be just one of the best things I've ever done. Never done it before but
I was looking forward to it. I showed up at the site where we were to begin with
the backpack with every conceivable utility and piece of equipment that you can imagine.
I mean, literally, I had enough stuff to build a frontier village.
And I noticed when I walked up, all of the other guys that were going on this journey kind
a smirk, a little bit kind of grand whisper to each other. I thought probably there in
press with what I'm bringing. About three miles in, I figured out, you know what? I'd
rather die than carry some of this stuff. I started unloading the backpack. I promise
She there probably pots and pans from 1978 still up air around cleanman's domes.
By the time I got down after five days of backpacking I had a sleeping bag, one pan, and
couple of pairs of dry socks. I learned a very valuable lesson. Number one is if you're
going to get anything done, if you're really going to accomplish something, if you're
really going to bake the journey, there's a bunch of things that you need to let go of.
all the stuff the world tells you that you need, you don't need.
In fact, Jesus said everything that God ever said is built on this foundation.
Love God, love people.
And then everything else is just trying to figure that out.
also learn that your friends know all the junk that you're carrying that you don't need
to carry. But they're probably not going to tell you that you're carrying it unless you
ask them. You know, the Apostle Paul said, help one another with the burdens, thus fulfill
the law of Christ. We need to be sure that we understand, especially in this room, that
our part of our function is to work together for the good of all Georgians, that we should
help one another not only carry the load, but also figure out some of the stuff that
maybe you need to let go of, because everything that you're holding on to is not valuable or needed.
You'll kind of remind me of David getting ready to go fight God's life.
And King Saul loaded him down with this armor.
Now, I always tell people, don't let the Bible just be words on the page.
You got to dig in a little bit.
And the description of Saul was that he was a head taller than everybody in Israel.
So guess what, Paul, Saul knew that that armor was not going to fit David.
So why did he load him down with it?
I think he was trying to convince him not to go out and fight Goliath.
Now why did he not want him to go fight Goliath?
know why, because he was the king, he was supposed to be out there doing it. He couldn't
find the courage to do it, and so instead of encouraging somebody else to do it, he
tried to load him down with too much junk to try to talk him out of it. David had enough
sense and enough courage to say, I don't need this. And he picked up five stones and did
impossible. So I want to encourage you as representatives of the people of the
state of Georgia to be willing to let go of the stuff that doesn't matter, that
she don't need, to be able to be willing to help one another regardless of where
you come from or how you got here. And number three, and most importantly, don't let anybody
talk you out of the fight. Because you're here for a reason. And the fight should be to
make life better for every Georgian. Would you join me in a word prayer?
Father, give us strength this day. Give us courage. Give us wisdom. Give us
discernment. I pray for the members of this house that you would bless them so
that they might bless others, that you would give them a spirit of cooperation, unity and peace,
that what they do here might improve the lives of every Georgian, that it might help us
to be able to live freely and with peace and community in this state.
Father, thank you for the leadership, thank you for the strength that you've given them,
bless them, bless their families, bless this state.
We give thanks for all the blessings that we have, most of all, for your Son Jesus and
it's in His name that we pray, amen.
pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which
it stands. One nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
Thank you for those words of wisdom and this group is certainly always working for the
the best of people of Georgia, so thank you.
Members, you may greet Brother Dillard in the south any room.

Thank you Mr. Speaker. It's my pleasure to recognize the Georgia Business Aviation
Association with us up in the gallery. If you all please stand. The Georgia's Business
Aviation Association is very important to Georgia. They play a critical role in strengthening
Georgia's economy and supporting thousands of high quality jobs, as well as helping ensure
that Georgia's airports, large and small, remain viable for the economy, and through their

Thank you all for what y'all doing.
Thanks for being here.
Continue to advocate for airports, right?
Good stuff.
Thank you, Whitbridge.
that concludes our morning orders.
Members, I'm going to ask you to come to your seats.
We have some important business we need to attend to this morning.
We have a further action on a bill we sent over to the Senate last year that the author
has worked out, so I'm going to ask members if you'll come to the floor and come to your seats.
I want to recognize Chairman Petrie for a motion.
Chairman Petrie, members please give the member in the well your attention.
Mr. Speaker, as relates to House Bill 444, we agree to the Senate's substitute as amended by the House.
Chairman has 443, right?
443, Mr.
443.
443.
Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 443?
House Bill 443, members and the P3166 and others to be entitled and act to amend code section 27 to 23 the Fisher go to Georgia, annotated relay, no license permit tag and stamp fees as to provide from the fees for reef and
of the regulatory fish endorsements.
The representative, Petrie, will you explain
the Senate's substitute in the House amendment?
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Yes, so members, as you'll recall, last year,
we overwhelmingly passed House Bill 443.
That is a bill that creates an endorse,
a special endorsement for refishing,
which is essentially offshore fishing.
This is something that our fishermen on the coast want.
It will allow us to raise funds to take possession
of the fishery in federal waters from the federal government.
And the way we're doing that, as other adjacent states
have done, is by using this mechanism
to raise the revenue to do our own surveys.
So right now, federal surveys that are done on our fishery
are basically encompassed the entire Atlantic coast.
And so they lack any rigor as it relates
to accuracy in Georgia.
And most of you have probably all had 100 emails
about red snapper.
And we only have one day we can catch red snapper in Georgia.
So anyway, that's the purpose of the bill.
In the last minutes of signing die, this bill was sent back with an amendment related to raw milk.
And so we are sending this bill back, having removed raw milk, this amendment on raw milk and putting it back in its previous state.
Mr. Speaker, I'm glad to answer any questions if that needs clarity.
Gentlemen, has no questions.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Q. Chairman Petrie, is there any objection to adoption of the House amendment?
Hearing none, the House amendment is adopted, on the gentleman's motion that the House
agreed to the Senate's substitute, excuse me, Senate substitute to House Bill 443 as amended
by the House, all those in favor of vote yes, opposed, we all vote no, and Mr. Clerk,
you unlock the machines.
have all members voted. This is the way we do it.
We have been practicing on your attendance when you vote green or red.
all members voted. All members voted. Representative Scott, if the lady are you
green or red? Green? Will you allow us to vote your machine for you?
Everything's Scott both green. Have all members now voted? All members voted.
But if so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machines?
On the gentleman's motion, the yeas are 165 of the days or two.
The House has agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 443 as amended by the House.
Thank you members.
new orders. We have a whole slew of afternoon orders. So we're going to give you, we'll
be a little bit flexible, but I'm asking you to hold your afternoon order to one minute
if possible. If possible, we'll be a little bit flexible, but one minute. And I want the
The members that give representative Sharper your attention, please.
We'll recognize representative Sharper now, and I'm going to ask members of the police
join representing Sharper and myself in standing.
All members, please stand.
We were going to have an image up, but they don't have it ready.
But Naomi Delva, she came here 11 years ago as an intern from Spellman College for the
Legislative of Black Caucus.
She was a young lady that you would see back with us a lot of times.
A lot of you knew her.
She was 30 years old and she passed away and she was encountered a lot of you guys, a lot
of times and no matter where she was in the country,
she would try to be here all those years after for session.
But I'm going to read this very briefly.
I earned the life and legacy of Naomi Delva for other purposes.
Whereas the state of Georgia mourns the loss
of one of its most distinguished citizens
with the passing of Naomi Delva on January the 5th, 2026.
Whereas Naomi Delva was a woman of vision,
character and purpose whose life was marked by service, leadership, and unwavering commitment
to uplifting others.
We're asked throughout her life, Naomi Delvey exemplified excellence in entrepreneurship,
community development, and mentorship using her gifts and talents to empower individuals,
families, and small businesses.
She was widely respected for her integrity, compassion, worth ethic, and she consistently
sought to create opportunities for economic growth through education and positive social
impact.
Naomi Delva's influence extended far beyond her professional accomplishments.
She was a source of encouragement, wisdom, inspiration to colleagues, friends, and all who
at the privilege of knowing her.
Her legacy will continue to live through the lives she touched initiatives she helped
build.
And in doing an example, she set a faith.
is fitting and proper that the Georgia House of Representatives pause to recognize and honor
the life of this remarkable individual and to extend heartfelt sympathy to her family
and the loved ones and all who've known her through her life.
She was also my business partner with Delvin Sharp Consulting Group over the last four
years and she was also the creator and founder of the Harmony Fresh toothpaste that a lot
of you are already using.
So therefore, we just thank God for this opportunity
to honor her and everything she's done to help so many people
all across the country and across the world.
Join me in a moment of silence, please.
Thank you.
God bless.
Thank you, Representative Sharper.
And our condolences, of course.
Thank you, House members.
Representative Bail is recognized for an afternoon order.
Representative Bail, get the gentleman to wear your attention.
Please.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for being in knowledge today.
First of all, I'd like to start off by apologizing.
I apologize to my colleagues, Speaker of the House,
the staff and other members.
Yesterday, during this pledge of allegiance,
when I stood, I draped a abolished ice flag over my back.
I understand that this is not a part of the decorum here,
and I apologize for violating that.
But like America, I feel like I'm in a crisis.
So in that, I acted out.
I'm a veteran, so apparently I'm somebody's mental health
patient as well.
But that's funny, huh?
But I do deeply apologize for that.
My country is in turmoil, and I
acted out as an activist, as a person that deeply cares about
all of you in this room in this country.
May I find better ways to show my activism and my spirit
and my courage for our country and our nation.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I yield the will.
Thank you, Representative Bail, for coming down and I'll
learn from and follow the rule of the Corridor in this house.
Whip Sam Park is recognized for an afternoon order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I rise to honor the life of Alex Prety, a son, a brother,
an ICU nurse, and a devoted member of his community
who spent his life caring for others.
His family described him as a kind-hearted soul
who cared deeply for his loved ones
and the veterans he served.
On January 24th, Alex Prety was shot and killed
in broad daylight by federal immigration agents
while exercising his constitutional rights.
How have we become a country
where American citizens are killed in the street
by their own government for exercising constitutional rights.
This is not normal, this is not acceptable,
and it should shock the conscience of every American
who believes in the rule of law.
The rule of law means allegiance to the Constitution,
not blind obedience to power.
Respect for law enforcement requires accountability
and transparency, especially when force replaces restraint
and violence replaces justice.
This is a moment that demands courage, not fear,
fidelity to the rule of law, not might, makes right,
truth, not denial.
What we choose now will define who we are as a nation,
and whether we will safeguard our democracy
and trust it to our care.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I yield the well.
Chair Lady Amp is recognized for an afternoon.
Thank you, Ms. Whitport.
Chair Lady Camp, give the lady in the will.
Your attention, please.
and friends.
Representative Ali, there he is, you're next.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good morning.
Last night's attack on Minnesota State Representative Omar
during a town hall was an act of political violence,
plain and simple.
Our public servant was targeted while doing exactly
what democracy requires, meeting constituents
and listening to their concerns.
That should never put anyone at risk or danger.
Political disagreement is part of a healthy republic.
Violence is not.
When someone uses force or intimidation
to silence an elected official, that is not a protest.
This is terrorism.
It is an attempt to rule through fear.
We must always condemn this clearly and without qualification,
no matter who the target is,
and no matter what their political party is.
There is no place for political violence in America, none.
Our democracy depends on civil discourse,
peaceful engagement, and respect from one another.
We resolve our differences with words and with votes,
not with threads and never with violence.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We're representing Vali.
Give the gentleman he's carrying on a tradition here.
He started again yesterday, so we have to say that.
And Ms. Ruckanay, thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Members of this house, I wanted to direct your attention
to the screen where 12-year-old Oscar is displayed.
Oscar is a wonderful kid.
A country music fan and avid reader,
but also a fantastic friend to those who are around him.
And so if you are looking to make a difference
in a child's life, if you are looking to open your arms
to family, then please go to itsmightturnnow.dhs.orgia.gov
to please consider Oscar for adoption.
Thank you so much.
Thank you, Representative.
A pretty cool John Deere sweater on there.
Sweat shirt.
Representative Lim and Representative Jasmine Clark
recognized for an afternoon order.
Representative Marvin Lim and friends.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
So often people will tell our stories
and those of our communities for us.
and when they do, so often will they tell a story
of our weaknesses, at least as they perceive them.
We are politicians, we've all been there.
Too frequently we don't allow people
to tell their own stories, and too frequently
we look past the strengths that lie therein.
This past week, schools in my district,
including one called Medo Creek High School,
chose to tell their own story about how our government
and its policies on immigration are impacting them.
They were not the only ones to do so,
but it was special that they did as the most immigrant
diverse part of my county and also in the face of fears
for many students and their parents about speaking out.
You may know I've come to this while many times
speaking proudly about the diversity
of not only my school's backgrounds,
but also their accomplishments across STEM,
language arts, sports and other fields.
It's been one of my greatest joys
to work so closely with my schools
whose greatest strengths still are perhaps invisible
to the eye, but especially to those eyes
who look at them only when a news camera does.
Today we want to recognize their strength to speak out
about what they believe is right.
But beyond that, beyond today, I urge us to nurture
their many other strengths in and outside the classroom,
the many other parts of who they are beyond statistics
that will never fully capture either their identity
or their achievements, and to build up their resilience
rather than tearing them down with their perceived weaknesses
as some have, and bullying students who are to me
wise beyond their years, yet still to be clear in their formative years.
In speaking to so many in the school community this past week, whose feedback we certainly
sought before deciding to speak here, I know two things to be true at once.
They are proud of who they are and want their voices heard in our democracy.
And they also want to go on living the many other parts of their lives without people
seeing them only as it meets our own preconceived narratives, speaking about them only when it
our individual purposes. I trust this body can honor that, and the best way is not to dismiss,
but to listen with care and curiosity when our youth decide to tell their own stories.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well.
Thank you. That was important, but I'll remind members
when you exceed your time, limit your cutting down on the next person's afternoon order.
I'm not sure they all appreciate that.
Rips and Scofield is recognized for an afternoon order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Members of the House, I really want you to listen.
We have partnered with the Georgia Lions Lighthouse, which operates one of the largest
eyeglass recycling centers in the United States, providing impact domestically and internationally.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Chris Riley and Gerald Pilgrim
for making this happen.
This box will be located at the counter of the security
desk in the capital.
So please bring your old eyeglasses,
including the broken ones, loose lenses, readers, sunglasses,
and hearing aids.
My goal is to collect 200 glasses by the end of session.
Together, the Georgia General Assembly
to make a difference for all people giving the gift of sight.
I'm the first one to drop it in.
I need those others to join me.
Thank you, I yielded well.
Awesome.
Representative Davis, could you do that little wave?
How you-
Yes.
There you go.
All right, members, that's a great opportunities.
So let's help.
Very important.
Ladies and gentlemen of the House, before we close out this month of January, I want to remind
us of something that Martin Luther King, Jr. once said.
He frequently spoke out about solids in the face of injustice, and he reminds us that
solids in the face of wrong is betrayal.
And that's why you hear members coming to this well, speaking about what is important
to them.
And I want to remind us that these are moments of personal privilege, it is not for debate.
So we need to respect each other's opinions and not turn them into debate.
So I appreciate everyone who shares with us because there's something to be learned
from each and every one of us.
And I appreciate the opportunity for us to have moments of personal privilege.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I yield the well.
Thank you, Madam Leader.
Representing talented.
Mr. Speaker, I've got two colleagues joining me.
I just want to let you look at your desk and see this invitation.
February 17th is the day we've been waiting on.
Fresh Georgia shrimp.
What more kids you want?
It's going to be good stuff.
We're following Savannah this year.
I know Savannah's going to be a blast in a couple of weeks.
Actually, two weeks, next week, I think.
And then this is going to be a great, great time.
17th, dinner, and cocktail start at five o'clock.
We hope to see you there.
You're all invited.
That'll be a deeper and a deeper.
Thank you, we look forward to it.

Good stuff.
Representative Rhonda Taylor.
Representative Taylor.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I just wanted to pause.
I haven't heard anyone say it during the morning order
and thus far in the afternoon orders.
But I wanted to pause and say thank you
for the beautiful garment bag that you left on our doors.
Can we give the speaker a hand with that?
I really, really like it.
Thank you.
And Mr. Speaker, I you're the well.
Thank you, Representative.
Thank you all.
I hope you put it the good use and travel safely.
Charlie D'Aimsy and Charlie D'Camp
recognize for an afternoon order.
Good morning, still.
So on your desk today, this often,
thank you, Speaker.
On your desk today, I know there's a lot,
But this often gets overlooked.
Chairman Campan, I want you to know how important the information is in here.
Many of you call and ask about some of the facts that are already in here.
It is exactly what you need to address any children's issues that might be happening
in your district and also anything that might just be speaking to your own heart
about our children wonderful fact sheets
that will tell you across key indicators,
how George is doing and how we can improve.
So please, if you feel inclined
that it doesn't matter to you,
share it with someone else.
This book will get you through the year though.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I yield the well.
That concludes our afternoon orders, Mr. Clerk, are you ready for privileged resolutions?
