I'm going to go ahead and get started, although we're waiting for the senator who's going to present the bill, but we'll go ahead and do a couple things first.
I'm going to ask our Chuck Payne to open us in prayer, and that's number six.
Number six.
Okay.
Let's pray.
Heavenly Father, we come to you today, Lord, and we just praise you for all your many blessings upon our lives.
Each and every day is a blessing.
Each breath of life we are given is a blessing of you.
Or we just ask you to guide us and direct us in all things that we do, especially with the children and family of our state.
We thank you Lord for all the things we will all our successes ahead of time for we know with you all successful sure we come
Who's in Jesus name we pray amen?
We haven't met for quite a while although it seems like yesterday because of our study committee that we had in the office
Is on foster care and adoption and we made some
Very robust recommendations that we'll be showing up as legislation a little bit later this session
I thought we might take this opportunity to introduce ourselves, and I first wanted to
give a shout out to Commissioner Broche and her staff.
You guys raise your hands over there.
Thank you very much for the hard work that you've been doing on this issue.
We'll start down with Senator Burns.
You want to introduce yourself, tell people where you're from, and what mic are you?
Lucky 13.
Okay.
Lucky 13.
Good.
I represent the 23rd Senate District of Georgia.
It is East Georgia down the Savannah River,
but from Augusta, Columbia County area down
through my hometown of Sylvainia, big city.
Senator Hatchett, you wanna introduce yourself?
Yes, and I'm sorry, I'm a little late.
Senator Bo Hatchett, I'm from Habersham County.
Represent District 50, which is nine counties
in Northeast Georgia, honor to be on this committee.
I've got four little girls at home,
so I know a lot about children and families.
Okay.
Thank you, Senator Estevez.
Good afternoon, everyone.
Jason Estevez, the proud state senator
from Senate District 6,
which is part of City of Atlanta, Fulton Cobb,
and I also have a couple kids and a wife,
so children and family,
and former public schoolteachers, well,
So I've seen it from a couple of different angles
and honor to be on this committee.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hi, I'm Senator Kim Jackson.
I'm from the cab, represent the cab and, oh,
Gwinnett counties, almost at Fulton, Wrong County.
And since we last met formally as a committee,
I became a new parent.
My wife and I welcomed a two-year-old into our home.
So congratulations.
And I'd like to introduce Hannah Holcomb,
who is helping keep herd the cats for this committee.
We appreciate your work.
And then we'll go over to Senator Brass.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
My name's Matt Brass.
I'm from District 28, which is Calida County,
Herd County, and currently part of Fulton,
and part of Douglas.
And we'll soon be just Carol, Herd, and Calida.
So, and potentially district six, but potentially not.
And I have a wife and three children
that are 10, eight, and seven, two boys and a girl.
And they're crazy.
Senator Panty.
Have you ever wondered if you're adding to their crazy?
My name's Chuck Payne.
I've represented the 54th Senate District,
which is Whitfield, Murray, Gordon Counties,
just in Northwest Georgia.
For that, I was retired state juvenile probation officer
for 30 years, case worker for 30 years.
I love my job because I love my kids.
And so I have married, my wife Angie,
and we have two children, my son, Chaz,
and my daughter Heather, and my daughter Heather,
and her husband, Daniel, have three children,
and they are my favorite thing to do.
Thank you.
Senator Merritt.
Good afternoon, everyone.
I am Senator Nikki Merritt.
I represent the ninth district that
is in Gwinnett County in the cities of Grayson,
Lawrenceville, and Lilburn.
I live there with my husband, my two dogs,
and I am a proud mom of two young adults, a boy and a girl.
Both one just graduated college, actually,
and one is on his coming up on his senior year.
So I think I have the t-shirt on our new parents.
I kind of know how this is done, you know,
my kids are doing well and I'm just very proud of them.
So happy to be here, we all.
Well, good afternoon, everyone.
I'm Senator Derek Mallow.
I represent the second Senator District,
which is out of Chatham County.
I don't have many counties,
but I do represent four municipalities,
the city of Thunderbolt,
city of Savannah, city of Garden City,
and the city of Port Wentworth.
And so I'm excited to be here.
Before that, I serve 15 years
with the Boy Scouts of America's director of operations.
and I'm currently CEO of a Community Revitalization Non-Profit,
so purpose-built Atlanta, purpose-built Savannah.
Thank you.
And before I give the mic to Senator Robertson,
I wanna thank Senate Press, legislative council,
all of our support staff over there
for helping keep everything straight.
And we have one bill today, it's Senate Bill 342.
And it's actually a department bill.
and Senator Robertson is going to present it
and he can introduce himself first.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
I apologize for my tardiness.
It took a little while to get across the street
and out of the capital, but I do appreciate your patience.
Yeah, I'm Senator Randy Robertson.
I represent the 29th District,
covers a portion of Muscogee, all of Harris,
all of Maryweather, all of Troop counties.
My wife and I have three children.
We have a daughter who is about to be 31, lives in San Diego,
a son who is about to be 28, lives in the Panhandle of Florida.
And the engine of the family, Andy, who is four,
and she lives in Katala and baby sits her mother, Teresa,
and myself on a regular basis.
And we, our family, Teresa's family,
especially has been involved in foster care for many, many years.
And we're adoptive parents, and a lot of our friends are adoptive parents also.
And it's an honor to serve on this committee with the chairman and
the group of men and women that are tasked with taking care of these children here in the great state of Georgia.
Thank you, Senator.
And before you present your bill, I forgot to introduce myself.
I'm Kay Clark Patrick.
I represent Senate District 32, which is half cobb and half Cherokee County.
And my husband is retired and much better at it than I am.
And I'm a retired orthopedic surgeon,
and we have two young adult children.
And the only people living in our house
other than my husband and I are our two dogs.
So we treat them as people, which is pretty pathetic.
But anyway, so Senator Robertson, would you
present your bill, please?
Yes, ma'am, I'm trying to get over you
treating your dogs like people.
Yes, ma'am.
This is a very, and when we hear it all the time,
very straightforward and simple piece of legislation,
I wanna thank the Commissioner Broche and her staff
for their hard work and their help with this legislation.
This is a department bill, and I'm reading off LC570035.
That's where I am.
Thank you, ma'am.
Recent surveys have shown that in most cases,
the runaway rate for foster children,
these are children displaced from their home,
placed in other homes, runs around 20%.
Some of these runaways are just a day long thing,
some of them much more extended.
This is an extremely vulnerable population.
And when they get out into the world where they think
they are able to survive,
they find out many times that they're not,
and they find themselves being mistreated, abused,
and trafficked by individuals in the community
that hope to do them harm.
And so one resource that is used around the country
to help assist recovering these children
and getting them back to where they belong
is the, and every one of you have heard about it,
it's the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.
This is a federally funded resource.
They work hand in hand with all 50 states
and outside of the United States
and working to get missing and exported children
back to where they need to be.
Well, currently, Georgia Law does not allow us
to share certain records concerning child abuse
or neglect with certain agencies.
And one of the agencies that we're not able
share them with is a National Center for Missing and Exploded Children and that's somewhat
of an anomaly for a state agency task would do and what this agency does would not be
able to share that information.
And so what this legislation would do would allow us to share those records and so they
could be used to help recover these children.
While at the same time by doing that we become more, more compliant with federal law and
under Title IV E which is the fund, the federal funded money that is put into not only the
Department of Family and Children's Services but also in juvenile justice and other programs
here within Georgia, he gets us more in compliance with Title IV so there will be much more funding
available to address the foster care issues here in Georgia.
And it's that simple, Madam Chair and I'll be happy to answer any questions.
Thank you, Senator.
Yes, ma'am.
committee? You don't appear to have any questions, nice job. I would, oh, Senator
Payne. Okay, let's see a appropriate time. Yes, Madam Chair, I'll make a motion that we move
move to pass on LC 570035.
Second. Okay. Any discussion? Okay. With that, everyone in favor, please say aye.
Aye. Any opposed? Okay. Your bill may be slower. Thank you very much.
Thank you Madam Chair. Thank you committee members.
And we will be meeting again probably next week. We'll send out the meeting notice.
and thank you very much for being here. We're churned.
