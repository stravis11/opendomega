----------
Good morning everybody, good to see y'all this morning, we'll come back in a few minutes
Morning, everybody. Good to see you all this morning. We'll call our first room's meeting
to order. And as we begin, I'd like to recognize Dean Green to open up with order for you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let us pray. Lord our God, we come into your presence and ask
to help us. Help us in every part of our daily lives, even when we do not understand. Be with us
through your spirit, guide and lead us with your hand. Let your will be done in all things,
O Lord, as we pray. Help us through your word. Bless us and protect us, guide us and direct us
during our deliberations in this ruse committee. And Father, we ask you to bless our governor,
our speaker and our chairman and the members of this
rules committee for we make the decisions that go forward
for the people. Bless us now, God is in direct us in
all things in the holy name we pray. Amen.
Thank you, Dean. Next I'd like to
recognize Speaker Proteum for a moment.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just wanted to take a moment to
Remember, Rule Secretary Mandy Ballinger, this is the first rules meeting that she has
not been both sitting up here or sitting out there in a very many years and she was, I
think she would most want to be remembered for, as being a mother to Henry, a wife to
Lee, a daughter, very devoted to her mother before she passed, and her father who is still
living.
And then after all of that, she was a state representative and a real servant to the
people in Cherokee County, and so if we could just take a moment, a quiet moment, to remember
or a many-balance or a moment of silence.
Thank you, members.
Thank you, Pro-Team.
Well, since this is our first meeting of the year,
we've got a couple of little housekeeping comments
I'd like to make.
First of all, we want to recognize our Secretary
of the Committee, Trade Kelly, right here.
here. I'm glad to have you with us and part of this committee. And also for you, all
the members and everybody get to know our intern this year with us, Davis Camusso sitting
right over here. Davis, glad to have him working with us up there. So feel free to stop
by and see him. He'd be glad to help you with whatever we need to do. Now, let's go ahead
and begin our deliberations this morning. And we're going to call on Representative
Chairman Smith to make a presentation to us this morning.
Good morning.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the Rules Committee.
Good morning again.
I bring to you today a bill called House Resolution 1-008.
And the background on this and why we're having to do this at this point in time, it goes
to the history of the State of Georgia and how we've dealt with our water and environmental
challenges through the years.
We've had extreme problems in the late 90s, all the way up until about ten years ago,
when things kind of had been smooth, but we only had Hurricane Helene to remind us of
the changes that are again starting to come our way.
One of the fears is maybe followed by a drought, there's some predictions there.
The group that handles this, the background for the committees who don't know, in 2004,
the General Assembly created what is known as a comprehensive statewide water management
plan.
The first thing that happened there was the greater metropolitan land area under the arc
of the ARC was created via a legislative bill and its roles to address the concerns of
that area for the rest of the state. We had never done any in-depth study as how to
make our state work together as the challenges would come our way. And so there was a lot
of, as only you can do in the general assembly, there was a committee to study that, then
And there was a committee to study what we were told about that, and then there was another
committee to study another thing until finally in 2008, we passed the first resolution.
And that resolution is guiding a template, a playbook for our regional committees.
As it was a new process, there was a lot of concerns, so a lot of people were assigned
to these regional committees.
And as long as we had challenges in front of us,
the members who are assigned to those committees met
and they had their forums.
But as we've had some quieter times recently,
most of our regional water planning districts
are having difficulty getting a forum.
And so the regional water planning committee
will have a council and one of their charges
is to periodically revise the management plan to reflect,
reflect new knowledge and insights.
Well, the insights we've gotten and I'll read
what this resolution is, the intent of the resolution.
So this amendment is to reduce the number of governor
appointees from 13 to seven.
Keep in mind all these people have to be at the meeting
to have a quorum.
Reduce the number of lieutenant government's
of six to three, reduced in numbers,
speaker of house appointments from six to three,
remove alternate council members,
increase the length of appointments from three years
to six years, require each council
to have at least one representative
from each of the water wastewater demand,
forecast sectors, municipal, industrial, agriculture,
and energy, those are obviously your consumers
of our natural resources.
And so that's what this bill does,
It's a resolution enabling this to happen.
I'll stand for any questions.
Mr. Chair.
Okay, thank you.
We have a couple of questions.
Very hugely.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
I'm good morning, Madam Chair.
Good morning.
A quick question.
Would you help me understand why we're going
from three years to six years on their term?
I understand reducing the number,
but it talked to me about the term change.
And so for this to work and the numbers to serve
all the committee had to be recommended
to your speaker or governor.
And what was happening, it was a loop.
By the time they got enough names to make the appointments,
it was three years rough and they're having to make new appointments.
So the intention in the beginning was good,
but the function is not what it needs to be.
The other thing to know is these are not closed meetings at all.
They're open to the public and people interested in our region.
She wants to serve, need to make it effort to get their names before the ones who do the
appointment.
So it's not meant to be exclusive.
It's meant to be functional.
We know that Hurricane Helene, some of the forecasts out there are droughts.
If we can't give our regions the tools they need in a timely manner, they're not going
be able to do what we've asked them to do. So it's not intended at all to exclude.
That's why I noted explaining I ran a business. I had a lot of employees at one point, but
then all of a sudden things shifted and I had to readjust quickly to be an effective
business leader top school. At the beginning I had about 40 kids in one classroom and I don't
know that they learned anything because you have too many to be effective. So the other
thing to keep in mind is that it's in a resolution form, these regional water
plans, except Fort Lanna, and we get to visit it every year. So if this is not
working, we're just trying to put it back on the right track to be efficient and
to be able to help the citizens of the state of Georgia. No one knows a few
who were here back in the 1990s on we experienced horrible
challenging water problems and we didn't get our act
together now thanks to the efforts of what we've done
through the years we are the most recognized state in
our nation for being able to address the concerns but yeah
we got to make some adjustments to continue to help
our citizens have another question
Dr. Newton, Chairman Newton.
Thank you, Ms. Chairman.
Thank you for the bill.
Is this mostly a structural setup for this council to allow
it to run more efficiently and be able to get it?
Or does it actually get into the real specific plan as well?
Are there interbasin transfers allowed?
Things like that that some rural areas have been more concerned about
with a metropolitan area that may have water needs.
Interbasin transfers, at least over in my east area,
Is a concern, are we approving a plan or just to make the structure a workable structure?
We are making the structure work.
Any change to a plan would have to come through the legislative process as a bill.
And so this is really giving the people who are serving our citizens something that works.
So they can, the best way to explain it, there are some parts of the state who are still
able to do it.
meeting with other regions especially along the coast because they are facing more immediate
problems and they're doing what they were charged to do which is meeting, coming up with
ideas addressing the problems but they have no legislative power. It is building an
and a free to call for the regents of our state.
Okay, don't see any other questions.
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.
Okay.
Let's set a calendar for January the 29th,
legislative day nine, under modified structure.
House resolution 1008, is there a move in a second?
is there any opposition it's on okay that will be our calendar for the next
legislative day the ninth let me make a couple of announcements before we break
up first of all today every day that we're here is a special day but today is a
very special day because it's the birthday of Speaker Proteam J. and Jones
