you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you this house will come back to order this house will come back to order Mr. Clark, you want to ring the bill? you you you you you you you you Okay, I thought it might be good to go ahead and do our birthdays today. We have a birthday today and I want you to notice the campaign slogan, Experience. Don't say anything about good looks. Don't say they're bad intelligence experience. How many years experience do you have? Huh? Yeah. So let's all join in and wish a happy birthday to our dear friend and Chairman Don Hogan. For some of them here is still trying to figure out what experience that matters. What is it that matters? Oh well. Happy birthday, Mr. Chairman. All right, we're going back now to the rules calendar. Going to the rules calendar. The clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1354. House Bill 1354. My name is Paul Coma of the 80 first and others to be entitled to amend Article 4, Chapter 5 of Title 28. The official go to Georgia, Antietta relating the claims advisory board. So to create their lawful conviction compensation review panel. This bill ever for the committee on judiciary, non-civil that committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative Holcomb to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker. All right, let's give the gentleman some attention. Gentlemen may proceed. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It's my pleasure to present to you House Bill 1354. This bill upon the work that we've done to compensate the wrongly convicted. The title of the act is the wrongful conviction compensation act. The idea behind the bill is to set into law clear procedures and policies that will guide this process going forward. So instead of it being done on an ad hoc basis coming through the general assembly, what this proposal would do in the meat of the bill is on section 4, which is on page 3 of the bill would be to set up a wrongful conviction compensation review panel. The statute has or the proposed statute has clear standards in terms of what would need to be demonstrated and that is on the bottom of page 4 and beginning at lines 85. And the bottom line is this, an individual would have to prove that they're innocent. They would have to demonstrate with evidence with testimony that they were innocent. And then if they were innocent, then a recommendation could be made in terms of compensation. The board would consist of expertise. And it would have a judge who would be appointed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Georgia, a district attorney, a criminal defense attorney, and then an attorney, a forensic science expert or law professor with expertise in wrongful convictions appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and then similarly an individual with similar experience appointed by the president of the Senate. So these individuals would have the expertise to evaluate these claims, to listen to the evidence, and then to make a recommendation. As it works now, it goes through the claims advisory board and that does not have the requisite experience and systems to really handle this process. My hope is that it would be very rare that this would ever be needed, but if and when it is needed, we'll have a good plan in place for evaluating these measures. Compensation, the legislation provides a floor and a ceiling. The floor would be 50,000. The ceiling would be 100,000 and that's found on page seven of the bill. The average across the country is around 70,000 and 38 states have similar policies to what is being proposed here. So the majority of states have a statewide compensation process. The federal rate is also approximately 70,000. And after this panel, here's the evidence, it would make a recommendation to the claim advisory board, so that would still be in existence. And then it would go up to the Chief Justice to review and accept the findings. And if the Chief Justice reviewed and accepted, it would then be subject to appropriations just as the current process is. But it would take it out of the hands of the legislature, create a new process with clear guardrails. And then in terms of just support for this, we worked really hard on it. And I want to thank Chairman Abstration for his hard work on it and also Chairman Houston for her support of this measure and representative Hewley for working on these measures for many, many years. The prosecutors are supportive of this, the Defense Council, lawyers are supportive of this. The Georgia Innocence Project, who has done a lot of work to help those who have been wrongly convicted is supportive of this. So I think it's a very important measure. One that I came around to pretty slowly as I acknowledged in my remarks earlier. I am a former prosecutor. I don't want anybody to be compensated that doesn't deserve it. But this sets forth the policy to make sure that it would be only for those that truly deserve it. So with that, I'd be happy to answer any questions if there are any. You do have a few questions. Okay. Thank you. Mr. Speaker. I will. Thank you. Chair recognizes Chairman Parsons to your left for a question. Thank you, Speaker. Is gentleman you? I do. Yes, sir. Is it true this ID has been around for some time. I know for at least the last 15, 16 years, there's been people have had, legislators have had bills in for this type of thing. I think that's true. Well, isn't it true that based on what you said, it would be taking this out of the hands of the legislature, but proving guilt or innocence would be actually taking away from the court in which the original conviction was held. Isn't that true? You said that this commission would actually have, would determine whether that person was guilty or innocent and whether or not they should have compensation. Is that not true? No. And I'm sorry if I wasn't clear on that. And individual would have to already be exonerated to get to this stage. So they'd have to go through that court process which is really challenging and difficult. And so there's built in I think the safeguards to protect that. So this would deal with the types of situations that we had tonight where individuals were clearly not guilty and they were exonerated by the legal system itself. Thank you. You're welcome. Do you further you? I do. Chair recognizes representative Derek Jackson up in the gallery for a question. Does the gentleman yield? Yes. Although I appreciate the spirit and the intent of House Bill 1354, with regards to the 50 to 100,000, which seems to be a very large gap, could you share with us? Because not all crimes are created equal. How do we minimize or this commission minimized the subjectivity that may very well cause for one to get 50,000 versus 100,000? That's a great question. And one of the criteria within the statute is for them to have consistency. So we want there to be more consistency across the board and they would provide statements as to the basis for their judgments. And this would only apply for people who spent time in prison, but one factor that could impact the range could be the skill level of the individual who has incarcerated their earning power, things like that. So it gives a little bit of flexibility for the panel to consider. And those would be part of the factors and evidence that would be presented at the hearing. Do you yield for one more question? Yes. I would like to make up for the commission. Can you expound upon who exactly would be part of this commission? Yes. I explained it. And I'll reference it again. It's on page 4, line 72 to 77. And I went over that before. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. You further you? Yes. Chair recognizes Chairman Hauston to your right for a question. Is it not true that I've served on this several times and is it not true? I appreciate you doing this because it's a very emotional thing. And is it not true that people you have selected to decide this won't be quite as emotional as some women that you might have all the money? Not that women are emotional, but anyway. But I do appreciate you doing this. Thank you. And if we do this, pass this, if I've ever asked to do it again, I'll never have to. Thank you. Thank you. You finished? Yes, Mr. Speaker. I'll yield the well. And I ask for your favorable consideration. Thank you. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, we have other members that wish to be heard. Chair recognizes the chair of the Judiciary Committee, Chairman of the Administration, to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I wasn't planning to speak on this legislation tonight, but with some of the questions that were asked, I just wanted to give a brief recollection of some of the history here. I know we got a lot of bills on the calendar, so I'll get right to it. But my first experience here at the state capitol was as an intern. I got to sit in on meetings, see what was going on, and this was almost 20 years ago. This issue was being debated in a committee. It was how to address compensation of wrongfully convicted individuals. And when I was elected, I was certainly familiar with this issue. I'm a member of the Appropriations Committee. I'd see the resolutions that would come through each year. I was familiar with the lack of consistency in the process with respect to how legislators might analyze resolutions that are coming through. And that procedure I was familiar with, Representative Hugley's work, and the study committees and work that have been done over the years on this issue. And over the off season, I was approached by folks from the Georgianisense Project who said, you know, we really would like to work on some consistency. And so what does this legislation do here today? Number one provides a consistent process that allows experts in the areas of criminal justice issues around wrongfully convicted individuals to analyze these issues. And secondly, it provides a procedure that we can ultimately use our legislative discretion to determine whether the appropriation is appropriate, but that's with a recommendation from experts. And it's with consistency in the law as to what appropriate compensation should be, a range of what that amount should be, so that it isn't different based upon different claims. So that legislators aren't sitting there attempting to judge whether or not the case was appropriately ultimately determined that the person who was wrongfully convicted truly was not guilty. Look, the bottom line is a person who is wrongfully convicted of a crime can never be fully compensated monetarily for that time. But by having a panel that reviews these cases makes a determination as to whether it is appropriate to compensate that person and then provides a recommendation for what that compensation should be that is then sent to ultimately the House Appropriations Committee to review that and decide whether or not the appropriation should be made. That is a process that we need to implement in the state. And in my view, you can support these resolutions or pose these resolutions and recognize the need to have a standard process that we follow in these circumstances. And just the final thing I want to cover, I represent the whole come went through, I think a lot of the specifics of the bill that are helpful to know. But we can finally once and for all have a process in place where experts, judges, prosecutors, criminal defense attorneys, forensic science experts can review these matters and answer Chairman Parsons question. This is only after the conviction has been determined to have been wrongful. It is only after in a court of law it has been determined that that person was innocent. Only after in court that that happened could acclaim it then pursue a claim under this statute. So that judicial process is preserved. We're just letting experts on this compensation board, it's a sub panel that compensation board make that determination, send those recommendations to the House Appropriations Committee so we can then make a decision. Legislative authority is not eroded here. In fact, it strengthened because we get recommendations from experts who know what they're talking about and we get guidelines of what that compensation should be. So I want to give you a little reason for those reasons I'd encourage you, regardless of how you feel about compensation in these circumstances, it's good policy to have a procedure in place and have consistency in the amounts that are recommended for these circumstances. I yield the will. I recognize this representative Fleming to speak to the bill. He waves. Chair recognizes representative Huggley to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House. I rise in full support of this measure. As you know, I probably have more compensation resolutions than anybody in this chamber. And it is a traumatic experience for the legislator, for the subcommittee that's appointed for everybody involved. And some of those resolutions have in essence put the person on trial again. And we've had people that have been incarcerated for 10 years, 20 years, 30 years. And you can never give a person back the time they've lost from their family, the time that they were unable to go to Mother's funeral or Father's funeral or see their children grow up. We have a good justice system here in the state of Georgia. But when we are wrong, when the state of Georgia is wrong, we...

of an obligation to try and make it right. And this bill gives us an outline so that each person who is similarly situated will be treated the same. If you went back and looked at the compensation resolutions that have been passed by this general assembly, you will see the inequities. Some people get various amounts. We've even had one resolution where the person was required to be drug tested every year in order to make sure that his annuity will continue. This would eliminate that because right now, the people who are the claims advisory board are agency heads. They are not people who are steeped in law. And what we're going to do is have legal experts review this, give us a recommendation. It will come to us through the budget process. So we're not seeding our authority. We're improving it by getting expert opinions as it comes to us. And then it won't matter if the person is from Columbus or Hawaii, or if the legislator that represents that area is R or D. What we want to do is make sure that justice is served. And I submit to you that this will help us in terms of being fair to all of our citizens. So I ask you to support this bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I yield a well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those of those who vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? Have so the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 1354. The eyes are 157. The nays are 11. This bill, having received the requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Decorated the caption to House Bill 1424. House Bill 1424, where I was going to follow the 30 second and others to be titled an act to amend chapter 27 of Title 50 of the official quota Georgia Anitari relating the Georgia Lottery for Education Act. So it's to provide that administrative procedures and actions regarding bona fide coin operated museman machines shall be subject to chapter 13 of Title 50. This bill is for the committee on regulated industries that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes chairman Powell to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House. The bill I want to end, the bill that I want to describe tonight is nothing new to this body. We passed this bill last year twice, this deals with the CoM industry and the CoM games that fall under the jurisdiction of the Lottery Commission. This bill has been powered down to do only four things for the benefit of the CoM industry and for the benefit of the people of Georgia. First is what it does is it exempts a veteran in fraternal organizations from the 5050 rule. That means that they don't have to be selling merchandise to have CoM machines in their organizations or VFWs, your AMVETs and places like that, the fraternal organizations. It changes the dollar amount on the class A games. These would be the things that you see the crane games and those kitty type games that they put prizes in. This raises it from five to fifty dollars the amount that they can put into these gifts. It brings the industry under the administrative procedures act. So it gives them safeguards as well as it does for the Lottery Commission that regulates them. And then finally in the last, but what it does, it establishes a gift card, non cash redemption. You know, may remember this discussion from last year. The idea that a lot of us has had where you see in a lot of cases that there are those people that are getting caught paying out cash, they buy going to the gift cards so that they can redeem for non cash or prizes or restaurant or certificates. And this would hopefully and what it'll do, it will stop any illegal trade. That Mr. Speaker, is what this bill does is part down. If you want to know why we've done it so many times, it's because it gets over to the Senate and some of them folks have had like to get cute with it. So we're going to send it over to them one more time. That Mr. Speaker is what it does since most everybody knows what it does. And I'm going to ask to answer any questions, but I'm going to be very brief. Do you yield for questions? I will. There recognizes the minority caucus whip, representative Wilkerson to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is it not true that the addition of the gift cards would allow people to use it versus just buying food in a store and hyperises they can actually have another option of using it? Well, they'll be able to use that gift card like a credit card except it would be a non cash reduction credit card. They can go outside to the Wal-Mart or wherever they could go to Home Depot or they could go to a long one or anywhere else like a visa card except it would be black blanks or it would be non cash. No further questions. Ladies and gentlemen, I would appreciate your favorable consideration. Chair recognizes representative Stacy Evans to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I rise reluctantly, believe it or not, representative Powell reluctantly in opposition to House Bill 1424. And the reason is I think that the aim of this bill is good. I think it does seek to address some of the problems with the industry. I don't think it cleans everything up, but I think it makes, you know, give it the old good college try. And I think that's a good thing and I want to encourage that. But ultimately, this is something that the industry has asked for. And we should not check our common sense at the door, ladies and gentlemen, if the industry wants it, it means the industry benefits. It means there will be more money to be made. And if the industry is going to ask us for something that benefits them, then I think the state should benefit further as well. We should not fool ourselves that these machines attract nuisance. They create nuisance and problems in our community. And just like with any gambling operation of any sort, we might be willing to take the bad if there is an overwhelming good. And I can't explain to you how the CoM industry was able to establish themselves in this state and only give us 10% of the proceeds for educational purposes for hope and pre-K, which is what they do right now. 10% of what I've heard is either depending on who you talk to, it's a one and a half billion dollar industry. It's a three billion dollar industry. This is serious money all in our kids need it. We know there's a waiting list for pre-K. We know that there are kids that need more money through the hope scholarship to be able to afford college. If we as this body later in the session, hopefully, decide that we should allow folks to vote on whether we will have casinos or horse racing, we are going to insist on 20% of those proceeds to come back to help education in some form or fashion. Why would we let the machines get by with less? I can't explain that. And so because of that, I'll be voting no on this legislation because I think the state deserves more from what these machines are doing to our state. Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to yield for questions if there are any forming. Do you take a few questions? Yes. Chair recognizes a chairman of the station. Do you have a left for a question? It's a lady you'll. Yes. Representative, isn't it true that the folks who are playing by the rules currently will benefit from the passage of this bill? I think that is true. There are folks that are paying cash illegally and we know that. And so that's why I say when I started the aim of this to create this gift card is meant to try to level the playing field between those that are paying cash and those that are not. But I think we got to remember, Mr. Chairman, that because people do think this is going to level the playing field because that gift card is like cash, we should all be very clear about what we're doing in here, ladies and gentlemen. We are allowing cash. It's just on a card. So some might say we're actually legalizing gambling without legalizing gambling. And if we're going to do that, we need to get something for it. Isn't it true that for a system that's currently in place, this is an important protection for those who are playing by the rules? And only the folks who are not following the law are the ones who would truly feel the impact by this. In other words, if your complaint is more broad, maybe that should be in different legislation, but this bill is actually an improvement. Isn't that true? It is an improvement, but it's an improvement that's going to allow the industry to make more money. If the industry is going to make more money than the state, our kids deserve more money. Why? We don't have to let this industry operate, ladies and gentlemen. And if we're going to let them here, we need to benefit more from this. We let no other industry of this kind pay this little. The lottery is required to return 35%, and they barely do 25% and we get mad about that. 10% y'all. I hope that we could do this cleanup, but there's no reason not to include an increased percentage. Mr. Speaker, if there are further questions, I'm happy to yield. Chair, you do you? Yes. Chair recognizes Chairman Houston. Do you ride for a question? Isn't it not true that by giving give cards, we will collect some sales tax? I believe that is true, yes. But isn't it not true? I'm not opposed to this industry, but I would like for the lottery to get a bigger cut than 10%. Absolutely. That's all I'm asking for. Is for the lottery to get more money. I think we're on the same page there. Smart ladies think alike. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill. The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye? Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose is representative Bennett rise? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Persuade to House Rule 133. I ask to be excused from this vote. Lady has that right and the journal will so reflect. No. Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 1424. The eyes are 88. The nays are 79. And this bill has having not received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore failed. What purpose does chairman Powell rise? Mr. Speaker, I'd like to ask for reconsideration. Gentlemen has that right. And because it's cross over day, that will be now. The gentleman has moved for reconsideration of this House's vote to fail to give House Bill 1424 the requisite constitutional majority. All those in favor of reconsideration will vote aye. Those opposed to reconsideration will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. What purpose does representative Sains rise? Parliamentary inquires. State your inquiry. Is it not true by allowing reconsideration on this bill that we give increased ability for individuals who get co-angift cards to utilize it for additional purposes that are more productive to their life? If the gentleman so states, I'm sure he believes that to be true. The one thing you will do is get another chance to vote it tonight. The purpose does chairman Gunter rise. Parliamentary inquiry. Isn't it true that when I was serving as a district attorney that the biggest pain in my rear was these convenience stores that were running these operations and they were all done using cash? If the gentleman so states, I'm sure he knows where off he speaks what purpose does representative Stacy Evans rise. Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Isn't it true that another problem with these gift cards is that unlike the way it is now, you are not allowed to use your winnings from co-amps to purchase alcohol or tobacco and when we allow people to take that gift card out of the store, we can no longer put that safeguard which this house has put in place for the safety of our state for many many years. Ladies and gentlemen, what purpose does representative Ridley rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Is it true that this representative don't have anything against using alcohol and tobacco using those gift cards for that? Anything like a little perspective. All right, have all members voted? Have all members voted if so, the clerk will lock the machines on the gentleman's motion. The eyes are 117. The nays are 52. This house has reconsidered its action and failing to give House Bill 1424, the requisite constitutional majority. All right, that will go back on the general calendar subject to being voted during the evening. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1553. House Bill 1553 by the represent of Crow of the 110th and others to be entitled to amend chapter 2, 42 of the fiscal to Georgia and tentative relating to board and department of corrections, so it's a abide for adoption of rules and regulations by the board of the department of corrections. This bill I have referred to the committee on public safety and homeland security. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes representative Crow to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, this is House Bill 1553, also known as Bishop's Law. In 1999, January of 1999, Captain Robbie Bishop with the Villa Rika Police Department was shot and killed on traffic stop on I-20. His murder was later found located in Canada, arrested and extradited back to Georgia where he accepted a plea to life in prison without possibility of parole. A few months ago, it was discovered that he had been moved from a maximum security facility to a medium security facility, had obtained access to a contraband cell phone, set up several social media accounts and was posting on social media, taunting the family of Captain Bishop on the social media post. What this bill would seek to do is require that any time an offender is convicted of murdering a police officer in the line of duty. They serve their entire sentence in a maximum or close security facility. There is a mechanism for them to be moved. If they needed to be moved for treatment or medical infirmary care, they could be moved, but it can only be done so with the written documentation of the department and the family would have to be notified beforehand. So with that Mr. Speaker, I will yield for any questions. Do you yield for a question? Yes sir I do. Chair recognizes representative Graveli to your right for a question. Is it gentleman Yeal? Yes sir. It's not true that Officer Robbie Bishop's Memorial Highway runs through the city of Ivorica, which representative chairman Jay Collins and I both share together. Yes sir. It's from the further yield. I do. Is it not true that it is widely believed by law enforcement citizens in our community and across this state that Robbie Bishop was one of the best officers who could identify drug traffickers along Highway I-20 and was able to pull them off the highway keeping our community safe and that his life was had a hit put on it by those trafficking drugs in other countries and here in our state. I absolutely do know that to be true yes sir. I appreciate this Bill. Thank you so much. Thank you. You yield for questions? Yes sir I'll yield for one more. Chair recognizes chairman Collins to your right for a question. Does my friend yield? Yes sir I do. Is it not true that my first act as mayor of Ivorica was to dedicate the hope Bishop Justice Center as a testament to Robbie Bishop's service to not only our state but to our city Ivorica, Georgia? Yes sir I do believe that to be true. Is it not further true that the death of Captain Robbie Bishop still resonates with the residents in the West Georgia area and he left behind numerous friends and family in that community and they were very distraught when they saw this situation happen on social media is that not true? Yes sir very much yes. I wish to thank you for bringing this piece of legislation. Thank you for your support chairman. Mr. Speaker I'll yield the well and I ask for your favorable consideration. Gentlemen as yielded the well is there any objection to the previous question being ordered the chair here's none the previous question is ordered is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill the chair here's none the report of the committee has agreed to shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines.

I'm getting enjoyed this of course I will Chair recognizes chairman Martin to your right for a question. Can I rescind that? Gentlemen heel of course I will sir. I resemble that remark by the way You rescind me the serious question is your intent is so students at a high school have the opportunity to take the test at their high school Is that what you're trying to accomplish? That's exactly right to include charter schools and juvenile detention schools My questions are is it is a practical matter all of the Students in a school don't choose to take the SAT or ACT at the same time but instead Take it at different times somebody may be ready in February or May So exactly how would it it work for a school if a high school in my district wanted to opt into this Since these tests are given by a private company They can't give the test every month at every school in Georgia So how would this practically work so that we could implement it for our students and I think the gentleman for yielding our weight on your Thank you based on what I found out these private companies would be glad to give the test Whenever they get paid so you know The tail isn't wagging the head here the head isn't charged in the superintendent's and the school districts will decide and I'm sure these folks will be there for their check So great sadness Let you know that there are no further questions Well with great reluctance mr.

Speaker I bring before you house bill 1482 This will take a little bit of explanation. I'll try to go as quickly as I can Capital outlay bill and what capital outlay is it is an a grant program to allow K-12 school systems to access money for school construction the program That that we are addressing here and capital outlay is low-welt and low-welt project specific and What we're trying to do with this language in this bill is allow more access to the low-welt and Project specific money for the school systems in state currently and we're not changing it in law the bottom 25 percent by splash collections of School systems in the state of Georgia qualify for the low-welt and project specific money Currently that is 44 school systems in the state of Georgia These school systems need this money and access to this money because I'll make an example the the lowest Welk school system in our state brings in a little over two hundred thousand dollars a year and splash money So over the course of five years they will raise one million dollars They cannot build a school if they need it for a million dollars in today's market So what they can do is they can apply for low-welt money and Project specific money through the state for the grant and what they'll do is they'll forfeit that million dollars in the state has a grant program where they could qualify for up to 50 million dollars to build a school especially these systems are the also mostly rule Not Not heavily populated school systems in our state so you could imagine they would build one school Once they build that one school and they have applied for that money and received it they cannot receive it again for 10 years However, we realize that those school systems would not come off the list of the 44 bottom school systems and wealth in our state So what we do through this bill is if you qualify for that money and Get it and use the money then you come off the list of the 44 allowing the 45th 46 47 system to qualify and come on to that list and and possibly Access this money if needed We also put that if you consolidate schools that your school had to be a minimum of 35 years old that you are tearing down with the materials that we use to construct schools today in the fact that we supply renovation money such as Heating an air after 10 years roofing after 20 years um that 35 became a good number that this should be the minimum age of that school to tear down So mr Speaker that's what this bill does and assist the low wealth school systems mr Speaker I will yield for any questions You have no questions With that mr Speaker I will yield the well and ask for your favorable consideration for the low-welt districts and the change in this bill Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?

Speaker. I bring before the house house bill 1387 Several years ago when the enabling legislation for the school cameras was put into place the civil monetary penalty If someone didn't pay that civil monetary penalty It stayed with the vehicle This was brought to my attention by several dealers in my area that had had deals where they were traded in cars And the dealer had to wind up paying the fee the civil monetary penalty in order to transfer the title And we just felt like that wasn't very fair to the to the dealers and so what we want to do is change in legislation That if the civil monetary penalty is not paid the department of revenue will not allow that vehicle registration to be renewed And then after June 30th 2023 If that civil monetary penalty is not paid After a series of warnings and notices the registration will be Revoked So that's the Genesis of the bill and very simple bill.

Is that not true? Well, I could have I do agree with that but I think there are series of of what ifs that could take place in the reasoning behind the situation that That I've had to deal with with leaderships in my area Simply because you don't pay that that ticket Whoever's driving that vehicle the ticket goes to the to the register of the vehicle So that person may or may not know about that so this legislation will fix that Depart local government department revenue will send the notice out and Notify them that they have that civil monetary penalty if it's not paid it'll it'll be Won't be able to be renewed or if it's not paid after July of Orgene of 2023 the registration will be suspended.

State your inquiry Is it not true that this bill in all of his intentions last year and this year Has been to clean up this industry and to give folks a reason not to be paying out of cash And if it's the intention of the good lady that has spoken About attacks that perhaps she needs to price her own bill in To raise this tax and let it have a fair hearing through normal process If the gentleman so states What purpose does representative Kirby rise Parliamentary inquiry is it not true that while the lottery corporation gains some 145 million dollars a year from these co-ing games We heard it compared to thoroughbred horse racing We're keenland racetrack the finest racetrack in the entire world located in Lexington, Kentucky In the last fallen spring made had a combined handle of just over $25 million and even though they don't tax them at 20% If they did that would simply be about five million dollars or $140 million short of what we're already getting from the co-ing games that a Lower percentage of a bigger mount is a lot more money All right Let's do one or two more here what purpose does representative stacey Evans rise Parliamentary inquiry state your inquiry Isn't it true mr. Speaker that We have all said in here that we are going to try to level the playing field between those that are paying cash Which encourages people to pay more by giving them the gift card so the idea that this would make the revenues go down Is exactly opposite of the argument for those that were proposing this bill isn't that true mr. Speaker If the lady so states For mr. Speaker I'm sorry may I have a further inquiry? Sure Isn't it true that throughout this debate not one single person has told this body why we cannot have an increased percentage Coming back to the lottery for education to support pre-K and higher education and isn't it further true mr. Speaker that I have advocated For a higher percentage and was told on multiple occasions that there would be one and it is yet to materialize And that is why I'm so adamant on this mr. Speaker that we cannot give something for nothing isn't that true Well, I'm not sure what the lady was told So I can't What purpose is Reverend chairman Carpenter rise?

Speaker House bill 1520 creates the Georgia Council on addressing health care workforce challenges As we all know the state of Georgia's experienced significant challenges and hiring and retention of health care workers including physicians nurses respiratory therapists and others This has been exasperated by the covid And it's created a short as your health health care workers which has a negative impact on public safety and access to health care This council Will work to support the expansion of education programs Will identify funding sources and loan forgiveness programs will encourage investments and technology and workforce readiness Will improve retention and resilient Programs resilience to programs of health care workforce in evaluate laws rules in regulations and policies It will also create subcommittees to work simultaneously to look at rural health care Hospital and health care systems health care work forces and so on this Council will be repealed on June the 30th 2025 if there are no questions mr. Speaker I will leave the well

You have a question if you care to yield. I'll yield. Chair recognizes representative Maynard. Do you write for a question? Thank you, Chair. Does the gentleman yield? I do. Were you aware that most over 90% of patients that are in the hospital because of the sedentary situation that they've been in, they need physical therapy as a result after that? Yes. Yes, and this council will also look at that and look at the shortage of 28,000 nurses in the state of Georgia. No further questions. Ask for your favorable consideration. Thank you. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, we have another member who wishes to be heard and the chair recognizes representative Cannon to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Hello, members. I am excited to speak in favor of this piece of legislation. You see, I rise in support because now we're talking about what really happened to our health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Georgia. And I believe that's the right thing to do. I've heard from telemetry nurses, labor dolas, dieticians, clinical liaisons, and telephone triagers who have felt either ignored and left to fend for themselves over the past two years or overworked. And we need to hear from them because job scarcity happened, then emergency staffing shifts were held, then workers were told to go home, and then we're incentivized with major hourly bonuses, meanwhile demand for health care services grew. We saw this statistic show that between February 2020 and February 2021, the industry in Georgia with the third largest job loss was health services. And it's important, I believe, that we use accurate data for action. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation report on the Georgia Workforce Board website says, a pattern of unfair differences exists for people with lower incomes and communities of color in access to care. Why would they say this? Well, when the Georgia Board of Health Care Workforce announced its unexpected loss of its executive director, Ms. Hughes, in late 2021, many were concerned for her family and those were who supported by her staff. But also, many were concerned what this meant for the data that would come out of the agency. I remember our committee heard from the Georgia Nursing Association and the American Nursing Association in November when they said that they actually have internal committees that discuss how race impacts health care provision in our state and how they wish they had more resources. So I hope that this piece of legislation passes unanimously to be honest because it's dire what's happening for those who are working and those who need health care access. You see, there are 75 counties with no OBGYN right now in the state of Georgia. There are 78 counties with no general surgery physician and that's gone up since 2015. There are 54 counties with no emergency medicine physician and some counties only have barely any resources. In the entire state of Georgia, there are only 19 pelvic medicine providers, many people after childbirth see those and there are only 130 neonatal slash perinatal medicine providers. All I'm saying, y'all, this is a great bill. I hope that you'll support it. Thank you. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair has none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee has agreed to. Now this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 1520. The eyes are 157. The nays are 10. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1283. House Bill 1283 by representative Doug was the 78th and others being titled back to a men part 15 in Article 6, Chapter 2, Title 20, the official go to Georgia and it's stated relating the miscellaneous provisions on the Quality Basic Education Act. So it's required for recess for students in kindergarten and grades 1 through 5. This bill then referred to the committee on education and committee recommends a disbilled due pass by committee substitute. You still working on this huh? How long? It's a long time for recess. Chair recognizes representative Douglass to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My colleagues, Speaker asked me how long I've been working on this. It's been a while actually about six or seven years to get across the finish line. But I'm working off this substitute and I just let everybody know how important it is for our youth. We did a lot this year for our teachers giving them raises. That was well overdue. We had a lot about mental health this year. But if we don't take care of our youth, our tomorrow, we won't have anybody to give a raise to and we will also help them in the health care department. So this is just the same simple bill. I just want to give my kids recess 30 minutes and not take it away for punishment. And Mr. Speaker, I just want to commend my education chair and vice chair for helping me change the language in this bill to help it be more volatile to get it across a finish line this time. So I want to thank them. And also Chairman Houston, thank you for your kind words and helping me get this thing together. Thank you so much. There are any questions I will yield the well-natured. You have lots and lots of questions. Do you yield? For one. For one. For one. That makes me choose. I love doing that though. Chair recognizes, let's see, who have I not called on? Representative Beth Moore for a question to your right. Thank you, Speaker. Does my seat make yield? Of course. Isn't it true that this body had the good judgment to pass your bill last year as did the Senate? Isn't it further true that we're giving the governor one more chance to get this bill right? The lady knows by what she speaks. I will yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair here is down the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is down the committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is down the report of the committee is agreed to.

What purpose is representative Al Williams rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Is it not true that I appreciate the gentleman's tenacity and the first time you introduced this bill was right after I got on elementary school? What purpose is chairman Setsler rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Miss Speaker. State your inquiry. Isn't it true if we pass this bill we will make recess great again? Mr. Chairman, I want you and represent in McLaren just to go on over to the Senate tonight, maybe. Wow. Have all members of what purpose is representative Wilson rise? Mr. Speaker is the parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Mr. Speaker is not true that we are going to build recess back better. I'm not going to touch that one. All right. Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 1283. The eyes are 155. The nays are 12. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 937. House Bill 937, I represent 100, some of the 113 to be entitled to amend Article 7, Chapter 4, Title 49 in fiscal to Georgia, annotated relating medical assistance generally. Justice will provide for Medicaid coverage for our annual mammograms at no cost to the recipient. This bill I'm referring to the committee on Health and Human Services that committee recommends a disbilled do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative Henderson to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good evening to the House of Representatives. I finally made it. Colleagues, I stand before you to introduce HB937. This bill has a personal value to me because I was diagnosed with a rare early stage of breast cancer four months ago. And I say rare because doctors at Cancer Treatment Center of America had not seen such an early stage in 20 years. However, after three months of treatment last month in February, I rang the bell Cancer free. Thank you. Thank God. My bill adds a language that would require, because of that, requiring insurance companies to send notifications to women upon reaching age 40 to have an annual mammogram. And the reason I stand before you tonight is because at Cancer Treatment Center of America, I met a young lady, her name was Shelley. Shelley, a young lady, 43 years old, did not have a mammogram. She was cancer diagnosed at stage three. The cancer spread from her breast to her liver, to her kidneys, and to her rectum. She was in a wheelchair with a colostobag. Shelley said to me, Ms. Henderson, I heard you rang the bell Cancer free and I wish that was me. That was where I drew the line and started working on this bill. And make time to take care of yourself. Make time out of your busy work schedule, your busy life schedule with your family, and prioritize and get your mammogram. As we can see on the board 9,000 in Georgia, 9,000 women will have to fight breast cancer this year alone, 2022. And about 1,400 will lose their battle cancer. Those numbers are really excessively high. So therefore, I cannot leave this podium without thanking leader Beverly, Chair Sharon Cooper, who worked tirelessly with me to make sure that we got this bill done. And last but not least, I thank God for my husband. Thank you, honey, for coming here. My first bill, thank you for being here. This bill will allow many women to see sunshine and have a better life cancer free. So I ask you to favorably consider this bill and I yield back the well. With no questions, I'll make it easy. Is there any objection? Thank you for no questions, by the way. I'll give you another bill later tonight if you want it. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?

My first bill is still out. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 937. The eyes are 170. The nays are one. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1034. House Bill 1034 by the represent of Weed Hour. The 119th will be entitled and act to amend. Code section 4883, the fish go to Georgia, annotated, relating exemptions from sales and use taxes. So as revised the exemptions for the sales of admissions to non-reocuring major sporting events, this bill having referred to the committee on ways and means. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. It recognizes representative Weed Hour to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and colleagues. I bring you House Bill 1034. This simply adds FIFA World Cup to the list of major non-reocuring sporting events in which we offer a tax exemption, a sales tax exemption on the sales of just the tickets. It also extends the subset of the provision that we already have in place. And it's simply what the bill does. Mr. Speaker, I'll yield for any questions. No questions. Thank you all. You'll be well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered.

The official go to Georgia and Tetted relating the general provisions relative to the professions and businesses. So, to provide the professional programs that are established to address career fatigue and wellness and health care professionals are not obligated to report licensing boards except in certain circumstances. This bill haven't been referred to the special committee on quality health care. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Newton to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We've been discussing in depth a couple of things mental health challenges and we've been discussing health care workforce challenges. House Bill 1533 addresses career fatigue and wellness challenges for nurses, pharmacists, physicians and other caregivers. Doctors have gotten so much worse during COVID and now the current staffing challenges that we're seeing. 1533 provides for establishment of a program in which individuals would have a confidential setting to help address their challenges with a key point that as long as no patient or any individual were at risk. These are separate from board-ordered programs that are out there and available separate from employer-sponsored programs that many people find themselves a little reluctant to use. This bill will help provide for early intervention just like other preventive medicine health care and will help keep our health care workforce strong and available for others. I hope you'll support House Bill 1533 to give this option for mental health coverage and career coverage for all our health care workers. With that, Mr. Speaker, I know the hours late. I'll yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered.

The Fish Go to Georgia annotated, relating to contents and certificates and titles, certificates as evidence and certificates not subject to garnishment or other process. This bill then referred to the committee on ways and means that committee recommends a disbilled do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative Cantrella to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, this is a very simple bill. What it does is if a person who's confined to a wheelchair or has a dependent who's confined to a wheelchair, they purchase a vehicle that's been converted to be wheelchair-excercated and accessible, the cost of the conversion is exempt from TAVT tax. They pay the same tax on the vehicle but not on the expense of the conversion. That's all the bill does. Very simple. With that, I'll yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute?

The nasor zero this bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. What purpose does representative Bentley rise? Parliamentary inquiry. The State Chair inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that this bill is a great bill for all of the families and patients at the Shepard Center here in Atlanta, Georgia and for that reason I was proud to vote yes for that bill. I believe that it would be. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1350. House Bill 1350 by the Reps and of Wade of the 9th to be entitled an act to amend Article 1 of Chapter 5 of Title 53. The Fish go to Georgia and Tate related to the Probe of Will's Trust and the Administration of the States generally. So it's to require executives to send notices to beneficiaries regarding filing of additions to Probe of the Will's. This bill has been referred to the Committee on Judiciary that Committee recommends this bill do pass by Committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative Wade to present the bill. Thank you Speaker, colleagues. This is a simple bill. Appreciate the opportunity to present it. House Bill 1350. This will just clean up some language to ensure that the executor is not only notified of the airs upon the issuance of a will but also any bid and fish areas named and we also added a little bit of clean up language for the financial institutions in Georgia to clarify what security accounts under the uniform transfer of death security registration. I don't think there's any need for questions due to the time. I appreciate the federal consideration. Thank you. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered to chair here's none?

House Bill 424 by Representative Weedow or another to be entitled to enact two amendments. Chapter 7 to title 48, the fiscal to Georgia and Antietta relating the income taxes. So it's changed certain definitions regarding such taxes and to provide an effective date and a repeal conflicting loss. This bill having further committee on ways and means that committee recommends the disbilled do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative Weedow or to present the bill.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Here present House Bill 424. We've done a lot of great things over the years for kids in foster care and a lot of times the kids that are aging out of foster care are the ones that are forgotten in this process. These children, I would suggest, are in the worst possible scenario when they age out and have no homes to go to. Fortunately in St. Georgia we have great organizations like Lidious Place in my hometown. These organizations are set up to provide and help these children that are aging out. Some quick statistics of kids that are aging out of foster care. Human trafficking victims have a 70% chance or have a 70% of human trafficking victims have had a foster care history. 50% of kids born a team on the foster care will end up back in care. 81% of males, 57% of females have been arrested. 60% of them will be convicted. 71% of them will become pregnant and less than three will ever go on to college. This bill provides a new 100% Georgia income tax credit to support those youth that have aged out of foster care. Tax payers can donate to organizations like Lidious Place in provide assistance and mentorship to that aged out population. Credit is capped at 20 million per year. This is a great measure and I would appreciate your support for it. I'll yield for any questions. You yield for a question. I do. Chair recognizes representative Cannon to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. G.E.O. I do. I want to thank you for this piece of legislation. I think other members will speak to this bill. But I wanted to drill down on how this impacts the work that DeFax will be doing on the daily. I think you speak a little bit more to how this actually impacts the agency and the work that they will be doing. It would not directly impact the agency what it would is for these children that have aged out of the foster care system. These kids end up with no homes. They end up with no families. These programs have targeted and watched for those individuals to come out that need that assistance. So this is a propping up of those children that no longer have that support. Mr. Speaker, with that and left, there are other questions I will yield the will. Thank you. Gentlemen, as yielded the will, we have another member that wishes to be heard. Chair recognizes representative Eric Atama to speak to the bill. Thank you so much, Mr. Chair. This is a really good measure and I'm excited to speak in favor of this bill. Hundreds of kids aged out of the foster care system every single year. 51% of those children are not children. Adults are unemployed and 43% end up homeless. A lot of kids don't know until their 18th birthday when they find their selves homeless or their clothes outside of the home that they saw as home for maybe years or months before. And so we help these children up until they age out of care. And it is a huge fiscal note to helping these children every single day while they're in care. And then when they age out of care, we see them left disillusion. And when I say that, a lot of these children don't know a lot about financial stability. They don't know how to write a check. They don't know how to start a bank account. They don't know how to pay rent. They don't know a lot of things. And so we have so many different organizations in the state of Georgia that are tests with the care and trying to help children with financial literacy. And I keep saying children, but a lot of these kids and people that are aging out of the care are not children. They're 18, they're 21, they're 23. And they don't know how to write a check. Can you imagine not knowing how to write a check, how to balance a checkbook, how to pay your rent, or things that normally are mother and our father would teach us to do. And so we have amazing organizations that help these children to learn how to be stable adults. And with this bill, this would help organizations just like the representative spoke about and giving them a tax credit, putting money into funds to help these children to be stable adults. We always talk about being proactive and not being reactive. And this bill is helping us to be proactive. Because let me be real with you. If these kids don't know how to balance a checkbook and don't know how to be stable, they will end up at your door. They will end up in the street. They will end up robbing and stealing and killing. And this is what we are trying to prevent by helping them to age out sufficiently to be stable adults. And so I ask you tonight at 9.33 p.m. to vote in favor of this bill, not only to just help these foster kids, but there are thousands of foster students in your district that would benefit from this bill. I yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair hears none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair hears none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair hears none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 424. The eyes are 166. The nays are zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1405. House Bill 1405, I represent a Roberts of the 52nd to be entitled an act to amend Title 36th, the Fisherhood of Georgia, annotated relating to local governments. So it was revised the zoning procedures law and to revise provisions related to judicial review of zoning decisions. This bill ever referred to the committee on government affairs that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative Shay Roberts to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I present to you House Bill 1405. I'm not going to say this is a simple bill, but I will say that it will simplify things. So it amends the Georgia zoning procedures law to codify the process and procedure for challenging and appealing certain land use decisions. Land use cases are essentially divided into two categories, legislative and quasi-judicial. This bill codifies which types of cases fall under that category and the process that should be followed for each. Legislative decisions just for an example would be a rezoning application if a developer wanted to put in a subdivision on an agricultural property. They would go to the local legislative body, the County Commissioner's City Council, and that would be a legislative decision. Up until 2017, the law was clear that when you challenge that decision, it's by DeNovo, meaning that you get to present new evidence of full trial before the Spirior Court judge. If you've attended a zoning hearing in your local jurisdiction, you know that typically the applicant and the opposition only get ten minutes each to present their case. So it would be impossible to put on a full evidentiary hearing in that time. So basically this bill as related to legislative will codify that it is by DeNovo review. That's been the law for 40 years, common law for 40 years, but there were some spring court cases in 2017 that had overly broad language. And what that has resulted in is that the public and the lawyers that represent them and the counties are basically having to prepare cases two different ways and it gets really expensive in the resources are stretched. So in the second piece is it clarifies the surgery process, which is the quasi judicial variance. Those are decided only on the evidence before the zoning review board. And so those are technical and if you make a mistake on the requirements, it's dismissed immediately. It's not amendable. And one of the things is it's hard to reach a county person to get service. So the local governments are going to have to amend their zoning ordinances to designate someone that's available to help the public meet these requirements. Okay, I can tell I'm boring all to death with this legal ease. So I'm not, let me get to the good part. There is no opposition. ACCG, GMA, Georgia realtors. We all work together on the spill zoning lawyers and there is no opposition. They've all given me express permission to say they're in favor of it. So I would ask for your favorable consideration now that I've given all that legal ease. The yield for questions. Sure. Chair recognizes representative Washburn to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, with a generated yield for. Yes, I will. Is it not true that this bill will clarify the whole zoning appeals process and clear up a lot of confusion? That is correct. And will you give for another question? Yes, I will. Is it also not true that it will be most like expensive in order to appeal a zoning decision? For the citizens and the local governments as well. Thank you. Thank you for the question. I think I'm going to yield my time. It's up to you. Everybody wants me to get it gone. I yield. Lady, as yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does Chairman Blackman rise? Parliamentary inquiry? Is it not true that this is representative Roberts first bill? I think it is, but we don't have the fish. I understand. Good job. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 1405. The eyes are 160. The nays are 1. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1382. House Bill 1382, but I'm Steve. It's 164th and others to be entitled to amend Code Section 3662A21 of the official vote of Georgia and Tendor relayed and required training on development and redevelopment programs. So it's required directors to do yearly continuing education. This bill having referred to committee on governmental affairs that committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes Chairman Stevens to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, the House House Bill 1382 is a continuation of two measures that came out as a recommendation from the Rule Development Council. As you might recall, earlier we did one of a continuing education for water and sewer authorities of four hours. Continuing education. This one here does eight hours. For the first year thereafter, it will be four hours as the other one did. This will be required, of course, before you can get one Georgia authority money. I'm going to recommend to the Senate once it gets over there that they potentially combine these two bills. If there's no questions, I'll yield the well. You have no questions. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered that Chair Hears None, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill. The Chair Hears None, the report of the committee, is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? So the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 1382. The eyes are 162. The nays are four. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1464. If the bill is not passed, the Council will 1464 by Representative Gunner of the Eighth and others to be entitled an act to amend Article 1335 of the fiscal to Georgia annotated relating to the general provisions regarding the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. So, survive the Georgia Bureau of Investigation with the original jurisdiction who will investigate election fraud and election crimes. Chair recognizes Chairman Gunter to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, House Bill 1464, affects more of the election process than anything else. Does not affect an individual's ability to vote. And for the most part, this is a clean-up bill. We want to run through each of the sections and starting with section one, on to page three. This has to do with the receiving grant gifts or donations. They will all be sent to or controlled by the elected state election board. And it will make the distribution and decision what happens with the donations. On to page four. Blinds, 83, 83, specifies the local election officials to be appointed to the performance review board. And section three, again, this has to do with the grants and gifts given. And it's basically the same scenario that it goes to the state election board. Section four, this allows the folks working in the election to not have to go through all of the machines. As the early voting goes, they can take the count of the people that have voted. And it's still a ratio of 250 electors to one machine, but they reduce the number by those that have already voted. So it makes it easier for the election officials. So they don't have to go through and test or set up all of those machines. Let's see, section five, over to page eight. The only change there is the wording of the notice in the message to the voter. If you're sending out absentee ballot application, you have to have this wording on it. And it's just a change in the wording. It basically says the same thing, but they reworded it. On the next page, down at the bottom, 224, 225, this clarifies that all persons are entities that mail unsolicited applications for absentee ballots to electors in the primary election or runoff. She'll mail them only to individuals who have not already requested, received, and voted an absentee ballot in the primary or election. On to page 10, down in the middle, in this section, you can still produce blank absentee ballots, absentee ballot applications, and make them available to electors. So if you're somebody that's in that business, then you can do that. Section six was basically repealed by Senate Bill 202 with the rank choice ballot. So this basically just takes out section B, which required a right in absentee ballot to be included with the absentee ballot sent to the elector. At the bottom of the page, this requires that drop boxes are kept in the office of the Board of Registrar's, the absentee ballot clerk, or inside locations where there's early voting. When all that activity comes to an end in the day, the drop boxes are then locked. Before, I think it was closed, it's what it said, but now they're locked. All right, next page, page 12. This has to do with the ballot transfer form. Collection of the drop box ballots into a transfer case, which is locked and sealed. That's basically what that is, and it sets out the form that the form will be on there. Much of this bill has to do with sealing the ballots or the chain of custody of the ballots. That may sound like a big project to do, but really it's quite simple. When I was district attorney, and we dealt with evidence in cases, and those of you that out there that have practiced criminal law understand this, you attach a sheet to either a bag or to a box, whatever the evidence is in. It's just a sheet of paper, and every time you transfer it to someone else, there's a sign off. And that's basically all it is. It's pretty simple. And that's what several of these sections in this bill require is it sets up this chain of custody. And how you have to use that. All of this up through where I was at to now I'm on page 17. All of that has to do with the chain of custody. On page 17, it requires that three persons are to be present at all times while the absentee ballots are sealed in containers. Then there are unsealed and while the ballots are being opened and scanned. I'll page 19 at the conclusion of the scanning, the ballots are then sealed in a container. And the forms, the transfer forms of the chain of custody forms are to be filled out. All right, on to section 9. This is really a bill that was introduced earlier that we combined into this one. This has to do with employers allowing time for their employees to go to vote. And it's a scheduled time. Lisa Hagen, I believe, is going to come up after me and she can explain this in more detail. But that's basically what that does. Let's see. Poll watchers. Next is the next section that has to do with the party or the political body has a candidate on the ballot. They can have a poll watcher at the poll. All right, on to page 27. This is all in the same section. In this, it reads as described in this code section and subject to reasonable regulations to prevent overcrowding and interference with official duties. Certified poll watchers shall be entitled to meaningful access to polling places, advanced voting locations, tabulation centers and locations where absentee ballots are being verified and processed. That's basically what that one does. Then on to section 11. This has to do with a person cast a provisional ballot and then where those go and that they're sealed. Again, this comes out of a bill that Alan Powell had and he may be speaking on this as well after I'm done here. On to section 13. Line 775 and 776. We struck the first Senate out there regarding counting the number of ballots cast at the polls. In talking with the Secretary of State's office, this was taking too much time on election night. So we're striking that out and taking that burden off of them. And basically they already have the numbers on the absentee ballots or advanced voting ballots. Section 14. This has to do with the consolidated return of the primary and section 15 has consolidated return of elections. We just took the term sealed out of it so that when the documents are turned over to the clerk's office, they don't have to be sealed. That's basically all that says. Section 16. When everything is said and done with the election, the ballots are all compiled together and all the other documentation for the election, it's all boxed up and sent over to the clerk's office where they hold it for 24 months. And then they bring it to the grand jury after two years. And those documents are then at the approval of the grand jury destroyed. And that's basically what this is talking about. Section 17. In section A, it defines the term acts in a manner in any other manner to intimidate. And then on the B section uses that term in detailing out the crime of threatening or interfering with an election. And it's a felony. All right. And section 18. In this section, this gives original jurisdiction to the GBI in order to investigate or identify violations of the election code, basically. And what that is is they can investigate, but they're working under the control of the state election board and the attorney general's office. In section 19, that is their subpoena power, but it has to be through the approval of the attorney general's office. And that is basically the bill. And I'll take any questions if anyone has any at this time. Do you yield for questions? Yes, sir. Chair recognizes representative McLeod to your left for a question. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. Is there a fiscal note for this bill? No. Does the gentleman further yield? Yes. Are the county board of elections supervisors in agreements with this bill? I don't know. I know that some of them spoke at the committee hearing and some had criticism of the bill. Things that they would like to see changed, but no strong opposition to the bill. I'll put it that way. But there was criticism. There was criticism of some things in the bill. Yes. Thank you. Do you further yield? I do. Chair recognizes chairman of station to your left for a question. Is the gentleman yield? Are you? Sir, isn't it true that a chain of custody document allows anybody who touches something to be recorded on that document so that if later there's a question as to how that says, you mentioned a criminal case and that context, who had that evidence, who tested that evidence, who opened it, all that's documented so it can be reviewed later. Is that correct? That is correct. In the true that in the court judicial context, criminal cases, as you mentioned, that's incredibly helpful. In fact, it's necessary if you got a case to present in court, you can actually call the witnesses who touched that evidence at each stage in the process. So if that's to be reviewed, there's that complete history and you have that documentation just to chain a custody record. Right. It makes that evidence reliable to be introduced in the court. Thank you. Yes, sir. With that, I know that hour is late and I'm going to yield the well and ask for your favorable consideration. Gentlemen, is yielded the well? We have a number of members who wish to be heard on the bill. The Rules Committee has set a one hour time limit with that time to be allocated by the chair and it will be divided equally between both sides to be used as the members see fit within the group. Chair recognizes representative Paris to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, today I rise before you in opposition of House Bill 1464. This bill is the majority party's least attempt to rush an end-

Ty voter bill through the legislature. This bill will devastate local election administrations. It will harm, this legislation also harms our election systems in numerous ways, but what stands out to me most is the way this legislation attacks election workers and election administrations in Georgia. Who votes is very important? But just as important as who votes is who counts the votes. Currently, our state does not give counties all the resources they need to fully and properly fund elections. So counties have to apply for grants and seek out donations. This is a system that works and has been a lifesaver for counties all across our state. These grants and donations were a lifesaver in 2020 for the election offices in my home county of Maconville. But it's not just my county that benefited from these grants and donations. The representatives from the 24th, the 25th, the 8th, 18th, and 9th districts, and so many more all represent counties that benefit from these election administration grants and donations. But now, here we are. And the majority party is trying to prevent our election offices from directly receiving grants or donations for any election administration-related purposes. So instead of the people who know their county election needs best, being able to address those needs in a tried and true way, the state election board will have the centralized power to decide what all of Georgia's 159 counties need. Hence, this puts more cost on the county and their taxpayers in practical terms. So currently, if a church wants to donate their space to a polling location or donate food and water for voters, they cannot. The church would have to file an application with the state election board and pray their grant will be requested. And pray their request will be granted. How about that? We're creating more red tape and further hamstringing counties and our election workers. When all they've asked for from us is for our help and our support, but that's clearly too big of an ask for the majority party. Losing elections or the threat of losing power is not a valid reason to change the rules. The wants of conspiracy theorists is also not a valid motivation to change the rules either. So I'm asking each of you to stand with Georgia voters and to stand with our hardworking election workers and to vote no on House Bill 1464. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I yield well. Chair recognizes representative Dreyer to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise in opposition to House Bill 1464. I'm going to start with a question. Do you remember where you were on September 11, 2001? Do you remember the room you were in? A lot of you were right here. You remember the first plane that hit and the second plane that hit. And when you knew it was a terrorist attack, do you also remember where you were on January 6, 2021? Because it's the same. I remember exactly where I was. I was at the Fulton County Tabulation Center because that was the day the absentee ballots for the Senate runoffs in Georgia were being tabulated. I got there at 6.30 a.m. and there was a room that at the Georgia World Congress Center that was probably at least 10 times the size of this room. It had been set up so that the public, not just poll monitors, could access almost the entire area and come within about six feet of everything that was going on. On one wall, there was media from all over the country. And when I got there, I found there were poll monitors from all over the country too. They were officially credentialed Republican poll monitors from places like Illinois, Florida, and Minnesota. A gentleman from Illinois who was a Republican credentialed poll monitor kept getting in trouble because it was in the middle of the pandemic and his mask kept falling down and he kept trying to get to an area where he could look at data that would identify a voter next to their ballot. Okay? That guy at one point, as he was debating one of the poll worker or poll supervisor said, there is no law only opinion. I wrote that down in an affidavit that I have in front of me because that guy and some national groups filed a lawsuit claiming there wasn't enough access to the voting tabulation that day. There was a poll monitor from Florida, Republican credentialed who said in loud voice so they're ever going to hear, doesn't matter what happened, there's no way these results are going to be accurate today. So that is 7.30 AM that morning. Over and over again, I kept running into people with an agenda that had flown to Georgia because they had been misled by their leaders and they were espousing conspiracy theories and it was interrupting the orderly processing of the absentee ballots. It got so bad that at about 12.30 PM, and that's an important time, 12.30 PM, about six dudes showed up and I say that because they were wearing heavy metal shirts. They're about 25 years old and they had photocopied a Republican election monitor credential and they tried to get into the secure area. They were fortunately turned away, but right about 12.30 PM to 1 PM, the former president instructed the crowd that he was talking to to march down to the US Capitol. And I remember how that ended up. We have a provision in here that says the same thing that I kept here in all day. We need to have meaningful access to view the voting tabulation. But I want to be really clear, you could see everything that was happening, but some areas you had to view it if you were a member of the public from about 10 feet away, maybe 15. If you were a credential poll monitor, you had to view it from about five feet away. And why is that? Because the Georgia Constitution provides that our vote is secret. No matter what we do, the Georgia Constitution provides that our vote is secret and that is a principle of a democracy. But that wasn't good enough. The folks kept wanting to get back into the area because if you turn in your absentee ballot, you sign it on the outside and it's got other identifying information. The place they wanted to get was the one place where there wasn't vote counting being done. It was when an envelope was opened, the ballot was removed from the envelope. So you could see someone's preferences and you could see their name side by side. And I could see everything going on because I was only five, six feet away, but I couldn't see their name, but that wasn't good enough. So the National Group filed a lawsuit and then they filed a motion for contempt and I had to testify in court because Fulton did everything they were supposed to do that day in spite of all the disruption. I mean, there might be some disagreement in here because I just heard it, but we haven't seen it. Our Senate runoffs were conducted well. And while I'm down at the voting tabulation center and I'm hearing things like there is no law, there is only opinion. When I see guys in heavy metal shirts walking up, trying to get into the area that only Republican and Democratic credential poll monitors could get. In the United States Capitol, when they were trying to certify the presidential election, there was an attempted coup and a violent interaction. September 11th was a wake up call to this country. I think everybody in this room on January 6th thought it would be a wake up call. I think I hope everyone in this room believed and wanted it to be a wake up call. It hasn't been a wake up call because we're continue to enact laws based on the lies that led to the violent interaction in the Capitol and they continue to assault on democracy. And we are part of the problem, if that's the case, we are chipping away at democracy. We are chipping away at what has made this country a leader in the world and when we lose our moral mandate, it will never come back. When we fall from democracy to authoritarianism, we will not get it back because it has never happened in the history of the world. We can do better. We should be better today. We can turn the corner and I want to ask if you would just take a minute and think of where you were on January 6th, 2021 and what you hoped would change because of that event and know that you have the power to do something about it right now. I yield the well, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes representative Mallow to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I rise before you today to ask you to oppose House Bill 1464. There are a number of dangerous and harmful provisions in this bill, but I'm going to focus on one that sticks out to me especially that is very concerning. House Bill 1464 seeks to give the GBI sweeping new powers over our elections in this state. The use and threat of law enforcement in the event and related to elections isn't something that is new and is not conjecture and that the involvement in law enforcement can and has been used to intimidate voters especially those voters of color. Now, you may think that is not the case, but for the constituents that I represent, that is very much a reality because they have lived through it. If you don't believe, may I encourage you to go talk to the general woman from the 165th House District who has led civil rights demonstrations all over this state. And I'm sure you can have a conversation with her and she can educate you and school you. By giving the GBI the state's highest law enforcement agency original jurisdiction over election investigations, members of the majority party are doubling down on voter suppression. Now, some would have you believe that this is not the case, but this practice dates back not only to the Jim Crow area and beyond, but under this chapter, this is another attack on the right to vote. I bet there's an even more example, more recent today that I'm going to talk about and today, I'm going to tell you a story that goes just back 12 years and took place in a county name like so many counties in our state after an art and violent racist in Brooks County, Georgia. So what happened in Brooks County in 2010 is the perfect illustration of how the majority party has used law enforcement to suppress and intimidate black officials and voters. And it's a perfect illustration of the majority parties voters with House Bill 1464 and giving the GBI sweeping new authorities over our elections. In 2010, we saw a blatant act of voter suppression and intimidation after three black women got elected to the Brooks County School Board and their election flipped the school board from majority white to majority black. And after their elections, they were arrested. 12 black people in total were arrested under the direction of the Secretary of State who was brainkilled at the time in these three women and nine of their allies and friends were all arrested and they were charged with 120 counts of voter fraud. And what truly was their crime, as far as I know, is not a crime for black people to get elected to office and to make their voices heard at the ballot box. Although in this state, it might seem hard sometimes. The election of these black community members and educators to the Brooks County School Board did not break any laws, but it upset the power structure that existed in Brooks County, which was enough motivation for the Secretary of State and state officials to send the GBI to investigate it. And it was even more motivation for the DA at the time to about prosecute these individuals even without hearing any evidence or having any hard evidence of any wrongdoing, even after devoting extensive resources to this quote unquote investigation, all the charges were dropped. I'd like to make a juxtaposition here that these folks were arrested in Brooks County quicker than the folks who had killed a mob Aubrey were arrested and prosecuted in Glen County, Georgia. But the one thing about this case of extreme voter suppression that sticks with me are the words of the GBI direct at the time he said. And I quote, it's really extraordinary that the GBI would conduct voter fraud investigations in quote, the GBI conducting voter fraud investigations is extraordinary, let that sink in, it's unusual, it's remarkable, it's unbelievable. So why is the majority party trying to pass a bill that would give the GBI original jurisdiction to do just that? Well, the majority party will say it's all about preventing voter fraud and that's exactly what Brian Camp and others would like to say happen in 2010 in Brooks County. But it's just not the fact, this provision and House Bill 1464 will be used to intimidate Georgia voters and election workers. It's also that this is unnecessary. The state election board already has the power to investigate alleged violations of our election laws under OCGA 21-2-31. We very clearly do not need this bill. My colleagues in the majority party and in the minority party agree that our most recent elections have been the safest and the most secure elections we've ever had in this state. So I asked the question today, why are we doing this? The people of our state have so many important needs and we as the legislative body have the power with the stroke of a pin to change the lives of countless Georgians for the better, but instead we're using them during this time to pass a harmful, none necessary voter suppression bill. But we all know the truth, we're wasting our time on this bill, the truth is, is that after record turned out amongst voters of colors that flip Georgia blue and send senators Rafael Warnock and John Ossoff to DC, we see that folks in the majority party are doing exactly what they've done before. Using any means necessary to hold onto power. And we all know that while we're seeing another bill attacking our election system and our election workers in the state of Georgia has nothing to do with election integrity or security this bill is about the majority party legislating on the line, the big lie. But I'll leave you with this as I close. Something we've all heard before and my grandmother used to say this, I lied, don't care who tell it. So I'm asking each of you to stand on the side of truth and the truth is this bill is unnecessary and it's dangerous and egregious. And I'm asking each of you to please vote known House Bill 1464 so we can focus on bringing real solutions to the real problems that Georgians face every day. And with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. We have other members that wish to be heard on the bill. The chair recognizes Representative Lisa Hagan to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I take voting very seriously. So I thank everyone who has worked hard on the various parts of this bill to make sure we continue to improve our elections process so that it is fair and secure for all George of voters. And that is why I'm supporting it. House Bill 1464 is almost 40 pages long, but I'm here to speak tonight to just one section and that is section nine. There's been a lot of talk about what some people don't like about this bill, but there's bipartisan support of this section and I think that it's worth pointing that out. Currently, an employer must permit his or her employees to take time off to vote on primary or election day only. This change simply says that an employee may vote either on primary or election day or on one of the early voting days. So it's that simple. It takes pressure off an employer to have all their employees leave to vote on the same day. It increases voting opportunities for working Georgians. It encourages in-person voting, which is the most secure way to vote. This bill ensures that ballots will be more secure. It clearly defines the chain of custody of those ballots. It reduces the chance of private money influencing our elections. And it expands voting opportunities for Georgia voters. So I hope you will join me in voting yes on this good bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I yield the bill. Chair recognizes Chairman Allen Powell to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and ladies and gentlemen. I like Ms. Hagen. I want to address one part of this bill. In our early in the session, I passed a bill out of the committee, 886, and this was the chain of custody. And that's one of the parts of this bill that I'm going to address. Past early on has been held, but this came to me from a lady up in Hart County. And I won't tell you all that sometimes some of the better ideas, we think we can be so smart in here, but some of the better ideas that we get come from constituents that actually sit back in the watch and see what goes on. But we've got a lady named Dana Smith, and she's actually such a nice lady, because she's the only person I know that says, Oki Doki instead of what some of the language is some of us used down here. But she was watching last year when we were doing the election reform bill, and she came up with this idea that because of the animosity and the 18 and the 20 elections, that there was something that was lacking as far as trying to bring some feeling of the public, that our system was being worked right, and one of those was chain of custody. If you go through this bill in sections 8, 11, 12, through various sections, you'll find a prescription for chain of custody. And that chain of custody is tamper resistant boxes with a chain of custody forms, so I'm gonna see you also, and it'd be recorded, so that the public and those investigators would know who's been in these boxes. When I say it goes through the whole system of the election, it goes through the part where the security paper, from the point of delivery to the election's polls, to the drop boxes from picking those ballots up, from the drop boxes to the absentees, to the scan ballots, to the provisional ballots, to the tabulated ballots. So this was basically put a chain of custody. Now, last year, when the election reform bill was passed last year, I said this then, and I'll continue to say it now, that yes, there's so much distrust in our society today and in the political parties. But I would like to tell you that the only way that we can do it, that is by putting absolute, irrefutable truth, and how an election is being run, so that everybody, no matter what your political party is, so that you can see and to verify that things are being done and reported accurately. That's what this bill does, and that's what this chain of custody language that's in here does. And for that, I want to thank you, for those of you all who will consider the vote for this, and I'm not up here to try to stir anybody, I'm not gonna get a pitch of the fit about anything. But listen, this is something that helps us to set the rules of an election, no matter whether you're in heart or fault and frankling or the cab or whatever, so that the rules of operation are the same, no matter where you go, and this chain of custody is a valuable part of doing that. And that ladies and gentlemen is my piece to this, and I would certainly appreciate your support for this bill. Chair recognizes, Chair Monnett, to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I'll be brief. You know, I'm not worried about where I was in January. I'm trying to remember where I was in November 3rd of 2020 when Representative Matthew had called me up and spalled in County every precinct, every voting precinct, every poll did not work. And every voter it showed up that morning was sitting in line, calls of a supervisor, election supervisor, who failed the train, but only failed the train, had no idea emergency procedures. We didn't have the required number of ballots, absentee ballots, or even provisional ballots at the polls that day. So guess what? She started copying ballots, and started just sending them out in paper boxes via county workers. Nothing secure. Nothing. Later on that day, she called people in, and said, go pick up the provisional ballots which should have been emergency ballots that day, and bring them back in. Anybody knows that's against the law. So guess what? She sent people out to the polls because the secure boxes were running over, and people were walking out of a spalled in County election, polling places with paper boxes of voted ballots. Voted ballots is against the law. There was no chain of custody, there was no security, and then she got those ballots back at, we should have been emergency ballots and scanned in through the machines, and it took two days to go through and adjudicate those provisional ballots, and nobody knew what was going on. You want pictures? I got pictures of where all these return ballots, or just blank ballots, or just sitting all over the offices. This is real, this isn't DC, this is right here in Georgia. This was right here in our County. As an old auditor, chain of custody is important. There was no chain of custody. How can you have chain of custody when ballots were taken out of the polling precincts, and there was no documentation. They never should have been allowed out in the first place that day until the polls closed, and they did a complete reconciliation. This is one of the most needed pieces of legislation, and if you don't believe it, you go look at what happened in Spallard and County. It's a travesty, I want to applaud the author, and everybody who worked on this, this is about the integrity of the elections, and I don't care what party you're from, I don't care how you vote. It's about the integrity of the elections, such that, everybody knows that the procedures are followed, and the rules are followed, and if they're not, we get to look at it from an investigative point of view and make sure that we keep up with the integrity of elections in Georgia. Thank you to the author and everybody who worked on bill, much, much needed legislation. Thank you. Chair recognizes Chairman Bershitt to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, we were doing so good today. I mean, we were all in here singing, come by, and getting good bipartisan bills put together, and you know, we're gonna end on this one. I really believe that this bill, the only reason that is contentious is because it's in Title 21. This bill does nothing more than add administrative provisions to allow for chain of custody, tracking of bills. These are processes that are already in place and that we're already doing in the majority of the board of elections and board of registrars. These are the things that are already happening. We're codifying and coming up with a uniform provision for that. That's what I believe that we're doing in this bill. This is a very good bill. I understand that some of my colleagues, you know, sort of beating the war drum on elections here, but this is a good bill. This does good. This has measures that broaden the ability for voters to go to the poll. For the first time in the history, as Representative Hagin mentioned, we're allowing voters to take off for early voting. That's never been done, but nobody gets up there and talks about this piece. The GBI, original jurisdiction, the GBI has been investigating elections for years. The only provision that changes here is they don't have to be requested by the Secretary of State or any local government. And if we can't trust the highest law enforcement agency in the state, who can we trust? Do you want to have cyber ninjas coming in here? And work on your elections? Is that what you want? That's not plausible. Please, please, please, please. I know I'm not changing any minds up here. I don't believe I am changing any minds, but I do want to say that these are good measures and the only reason that my colleagues are up here adamantly opposing these things is because it's entitled to anyone. It's in the elections code. That's it. I do want to run through a couple of pieces here. One of the presenters that mentioned something about gifts to voters and this does nothing to restrict gifts to voters. Doesn't, doesn't change anything whatsoever about folks in line. This does nothing. It does not change that anywhere in the bill. Show me where it does that. Show me the suppression of the vote. Show me where it's driving people away from the polls. It's not in the bill.

just read the bill read the bill read the words on the page and read them for what they do not what you think they do I'd appreciate you do you voting with me on this bill in support of House bill 1464 and our yield to well Mr. Speaker That completes the Members who wish to speak to the bill is there any objection to the previous question being ordered Chair here's none the previous question is ordered we do have a minority report Um, and by house rule That will be limited to 20 minutes 20 minutes for the minority report um Representative win. Are you beginning? Chair recognizes representative win to speak to the minority report Thank you, Mr. Speaker Last legislative session the majority party passed a massive voter suppression bill And we quickly saw the fallout from Georgians all across our state and from the business community Members of this body insisted that that bill would not make it harder for Georgians to vote But now guess what we have some evidence During the 2020 municipal elections Georgia voters were 45 times more likely to have their applications to vote by mail rejected And for those Georgians who were actually able to receive a ballot their ballots were twice as likely to be rejected under Senate bill 202 And here we are again the governor promised no new election bills And now we've got a 40 page bill Shubb through committee fast tracked onto the house floor And just like Senate bill 202 A bill predicated Unlies misinformation and conspiracy theories This time around We're attacking our election system and we are directly targeting our election boards In our election administrators who have continued to work on behalf of Georgians Despite the unfunded mandates Despite the intimidation and despite the harassment Every single member of this body should do everything in our power to ensure our local election boards have the adequate resources to carry out free and fair elections But this bill does the opposite we're now forcing our local Local election boards to jump through unnecessary hoops to receive private grant funding Under the guise of so-called partisan advantage And now our local election boards will be forced to rely on our partisan state board of elections to either approve or deny that source of funding To suggest that private funding provided a partisan advantage is simply misleading I want to be very clear in 2020 all 159 local election boards have the opportunity to apply for grant funding Some counties chose to apply others did not both Republican counties and Democratic counties received over 40 million dollars To purchase more equipment to provide hazard pay for pull workers to purchase more drop boxes to add additional early voting locations Cherokee County Lounds County Forestside County Pauling County Gwinnett County Fulton County, Muscogee County I want to also be clear the funding was not just so-called liberal Zuckerberg money It was also so-called conservative Arnold Schwarzenegger money So I want to get this straight All 159 counties eligible to apply both Republicans and Democratic counties received so-called liberal and conservative money No instances of impropriety and now we got a pass a bill that allows a partisan board to decide who or who should not get grant funding And on top of that this bill is full of unfunded mandates that will increase the workload on our election workers Many of whom already want to quit one in five election workers on both sides of the aisle They want to quit before 2024. They are burnout. They are exhausted and they fear for their lives We are facing an election administration crisis and we actually could solve this crisis By appropriating funding to our local election boards So then they wouldn't need to seek other sources of funding And we have the money to do so we just pass a billion dollar tax cut without a fiscal note So the money is there But instead of solving a crisis we're making it worse Restricting in kind donations creating barriers to funding Adding new cumbersome illogical rules like requiring election workers to count ballot paper Knowing full well that in a county as largest Bolton or Cobb That could amount to thousands and thousands of sheets of paper So one has to wonder if this bill is deliberately designed to sabotage larger more populist democratic counties So that the state legislature will have an excuse to take over those counties too Here's the thing this bill not only impacts our local election system It creates additional stressors on our court system By removing the requirement that ballots Records must be retained and sealed now that ballots are unsealed That means they're subject to open record requests to be handled by our court system Any person from any part of our country Who has no vested interests in Georgians can now come to our state Overwhelmed our court system With endless open records requests without cause And can use it to create chaos to so doubt To delay the certification of election by the state and to perpetuate the big lie So we are saying come on cyber ninjas come to our state and look for those bamboo fibers This is the other thing this bill is intended to satisfy a base that cannot be satisfied Now the representative from House District 32 spoke about House Bill 886 Which is section 12 of this bill the portion of the bill that deals with the custody Chain of custody for security paper ballot During committee we heard public testimony from Republican voters And they came to our committee and they said This bill doesn't do anything. It doesn't satisfy us. It doesn't restore our Confidence in the election system. We want more. This is not what we want That's what Republican voters said and I sat back and I thought wow Republican voters are gonna tank a Republican bill These are the consequences of what happens when members of this body allowed and continue to allow lies and conspiracy theories to go and check Because instead of being honest about the security of our election system This lie fastered and now it is uncontrollable I was a statewide poll monitor for the Democratic of party of Georgia for Decap County on January 5th I was up before the first poll open. I didn't get home until the polls closed Throughout the day I helped voters on both sides Republican and Democratic voters And I got to tell y'all something Republican voters are real angry And they're not mad at Democrats. They're mad at y'all I was at an early voting location That was not open on election day which causes a lot of confusion And dozens of voters showed up on both sides of the aisle. They didn't know where to go to vote So I helped everybody as they pulled into the parking lot. Let me look up your voting precinct for you This is where you go to cash your ballot And during that time a woman pulled into the parking lot in her van and before she even got out she started yelling I couldn't hear what she was saying at first And then as she opened the door she repeated They told me my vote didn't count my vote didn't count they said my vote didn't count and I said ma'am Where did you vote? And she said I voted here at this early voting precinct and I said When did you vote and she said I voted last week? I said who told you your vote didn't count They told me my vote didn't count and I said well, let me show you I'm going to log on to my voter page Let me enter in your last name in your birthday and let me show you How you can see that your vote counted and I showed it to her you voted at this polling precinct You voted early and you voted last week and this is the information here right here And she thanked me and she said I'm just here to vote because my former president told me to comment vote Y'all have done a disservice to your voters And we've seen that they didn't show up in 2021 Some of them showed up on January 6th at the nation's capital And now a year later they did show up in committee and said This isn't enough Because for them anything short of overturning the results of the 2020 election is not going to be enough And it's not going to end well Because elected leaders lawyers Alternative electors and other people in positions a power allowed this big lie to fester They be trade their allegiance to our country and profited off this big lie Instead of choosing to protect our democracy And this is what's going to happen Senate bill 202 wasn't enough House bill 1464 is not going to be enough We are going to continue to see this year after year after year And For the record Liberals we don't claim Mark Zuckerberg Mr. Speaker I yield the well Chair recognizes representative Shannon For the balance of the minority report about nine minutes and 45 seconds Thank you, mr. Speaker I rise to speak in opposition to House bill 1464 Several provisions in this bill Really are written so loosely and the language is so poor that there's really not a way to comply with this bill There's really not a way to know if you are complying with the bill I want to first draw your attention to section 12 line 745 through line 751 and I'll read the section No ballots shall be handled without a pole official being present and without documentation on the chain of custody documentation forms Of who is handling such ballots and when and why such ballots are being handled After the activity requiring the handling of ballots is completed such ballots shall be Recealed in ballot boxes or other secure containers which shall be recorded and witnessed on chain of custody documentation forms As specified by the Secretary of State and shall be signed by the persons having custody of such ballots This section is something that I brought up in committee when we saw this provision in a separate bill that came through governmental affairs The language is written so loosely and it's requiring you to have a pole official present when ballots are being handled What does the word handled mean when you look up the word handled in the dictionary? It says To feel or manipulate with hands Or a second definition is to manage a situation or a problem So what are we talking about here? Are we saying that you've got to have a pole official available if you touch a ballot If you move a ballot I mean literally if you pick up a ballot that falls on the floor Do you have to call a pole election? You have to call a pole official to supervise that When we're talking about elections It's really important that we have language that is concise because we know what happens when you have loose language and bills What happens is prosecution is subjective and that's when we start to see that when black and brown voters Exercise their power in and it's effective We start to see more prosecutions and so I brought this up in committee and I asked and nobody could answer my question I simply asked if the majority of the really important activities are currently already supervised by an election official today Then what additional activities would you like to see supervised and nobody could answer the question This section The way that it's written to comply to try to comply with this It probably means that we probably better hold the primary election tomorrow if you want to have results by may 24th Because it's really going to slow down our system And nothing is worse for the confidence and elections than taking forever to get results The next section I want to draw your attention to is section 18 and I know that My colleague spoke a little bit about what happens when you involve the GBI in elections But I want to go into some more detail because this is very recent history that has not talked about enough that really should be talked about Section 18 gives a GBI direct jurisdiction to investigate Elections that's not the way our law works today, but this bill will make it so the GBI can directly investigate Much of the powers that this bill gives to the GBI the state election board already has those powers They already have the power to subpoena and they already have the power to investigate so then why involve the GBI And you may say and actually the bill sponsor brought this up and said well, what's the problem with involving the GBI in elections? Well, it's very interesting because as Republican legislatures across the country work to ban the accurate teaching of history It's time for a history lesson There's a big reason why we should not be involving the GBI in our elections This country as well as this state has had a history of using law enforcement to suppress to to basically do voter suppression and this works by making folks scared to exercise their political power And this has mostly been used on black and brown communities So I'm going to talk a little more about what happened with the equipment 10 as people refer to it But it really should be called the equipment 12 because two people were additionally arrested after the initial 10 It's important to hear the details of this story to understand what really happened When black women flipped the majority white school board in the small town of equipment the state of Georgia arrested them and charged them with a hundred and twenty Separate felony counts of voter fraud Let's talk about the equipment 10 which was actually the equipment 12 and how involving the GBI in Georgia's elections in 2010 Destroyed the lives and had destroyed the lives of many and had the effect of suppressing black voter turnout Even though no one was ever convicted of any wrongdoing Not enough people know this story, but it is relevant and recent history This story is something that sounds like it's out of the 1960 voting rights Civil rights movement, but it's not this is from 2010 When Nancy denarned started working for Brooks County Schools in 2000 African-Americans had no representatives in key county positions and she felt that some school board members Seemed more interested in preventing property tax increases than providing schools with sufficient resources So she decided to run for a seat on the school board After losing campaigns in 2004 and 2008 Miss denar began to focus on absentee voters The Republican control state legislature that's us Have made it easier to use absentee ballots in 2005 and Republicans were regularly relying on this voting tactic In a special election in 2009 Miss denar won She then recruited two other black women middle school math teacher Diane Thomas and lifelong educator Linda Troutman to run for school board in 2010 Most voters black and white voted democratic in Brooks County. So the July primary was the key race Black turnout tripled from the previous two midterm elections and both women prevailed flipping the board from a majority white to a black majority Six weeks later state law enforcement officials under the authority of then secretary of state Brian Kemp Arrested Miss denar at her home four days before Christmas They took her away in handcuffs Place Turner squad car walked her into the police station Eleven of her political allies were also arrested including Linda Troutman, Diane Thomas and Thomas sister Lula smart Who was an active campaign volunteer The equipment 12 were charged with 120 separate felonies mug shots of them in orange jumpsuits were plastered all across the newspaper front pages The broadcast repeatedly on local TV and news and also used on the Fox News station talked about evidence of voter fraud It is funny because histories repeating itself Miss denar told y'all who news that she she and her allies were arrested because they had upset the racial hierarchy They thought they could make an example out of me that would kill the spirit of this movement She said I knew we had done nothing wrong The arrest created an impression in the black community that vigorously exercising the right to vote would be punished sound familiar Y'all who news interview two dozen people involved in the clays in the case Including members of the equipment 12 prosecutors local officials and state law enforcement officials and reviewed more than 1100 pages of documents obtained through open record laws from the Georgia Secretary of State and the GBI investigation Some voters told investigators they received assistance in filling out their ballot But most said they simply were given help to vote the way that they already wanted to vote prosecutors also charge of the fitness with taking unlawful possession of ballots when they delivered seal ballots to the post office for others Including family members even though the law clearly states it is legal to deliver a ballot for a family member District attorney Joe Mulholland filed 120 counts and all felony counts Which carried at least 20 years in prison for each of the equipment 12 based on scant evidence Their investigation revealed that the state under secretary state Brian Kim's direction devoted extraordinary resources to Investigating potential voter fraud Inquitment after local white officials and residents complained about the increase in black absentee voter participation This is 2020 all over again When the local district attorney asked GBI to launch an investigation and promise to prosecute So very heavy handed here the GBI agreed to work with the secretary of states voter fraud unit Even though the then director of the GBI Victor Keenan toll Yahoo news the secretary of states voter fraud unit has statutory Authority to conduct those types of investigations It's really extraordinary that the GBI would conduct voter fraud investigations There has to be a clear cut predicate for us to get involved Because it's not our responsibility nor did we have the jurisdictions to do those Despite the lack of evidence the state refused to dismiss the case during the next four years one of the defendants Latasha had died Lula smart face 25 counts and up to life in prison and she fell into despair and even contemplated suicide In the end nobody was convicted of having committed any crimes and this whole incident ended when Sam Olin's issued an official opinion on June 15th 2016 advising it what they did was not a violation This is about one thing and one thing only all of these bills. It's about overturning the 2020 election results. These time has expired Thank you mr. Speaker Previous question having been ordered is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute The chair here's none the committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection To agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill The chair here's none the report of the committee has agreed to Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of House Bill 1464 will vote aye Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines What purpose does Representative Wilson rise He waves what purpose does Chairman la Hood rise Parliamentary inquiry is it not true mr. Speaker that we must protect Georgia's confidence that their votes matter and their fraud makes votes not matter And is the further not true that to continue our tradition of defending the right to vote we must do all we can Do whatever it takes to eliminate fraud Is the further not true that a vote for this bill Uh is a vote for election integrity I am sure the gentleman believes that to be true What purpose does representative McCloud rise Parliamentary inquiry is it not true that I previously asked if there was a press a frisky note and I was told no The next question I would like to ask is does it require a fiscal note I don't think that it wouldn't Require one and you've already appropriated funds for the gbi agents in the budget that we've already passed What purpose is chairman not rise? Madam inquiry Stature inquiry isn't it true that if we had this bill and A fact that the chain of custody issues that we experienced in spawning county that are real could have been investigated And that We could have had real Integrity in our elections if the gentleman so states further isn't it true mr. Speaker That members of our citizens our voters who did go on to voter my voter page That they went and voted that it was not registered On my voter page Because the election supervisor and the staff Filled to follow Georgia code and Georgia election procedures I'm sure the gentleman now Has investigated that and knows that to be true What purpose does representative Canon rise I will entry inquiry Is it not true that I'm concerned that there might have been a members button who was pressed before the vote came in order for another motion to possibly have been taken up I'm sorry. Can you repeat that inquiry?
