morning everybody. You know we're having fun and visiting and had to wait a few
minutes for the room to turn over. Before you leave, you might want to check your
drawers in your desk and under your chairs there. The Senate was in here with
procreation. They may have some money laying around. So you might want to check
before you leave, see if we find any.
We're going to call our meeting to order and ask Chairman Linson that he would open
us with the order, prayer, please.
You would bow with me, please.
Our Governor Father, we thank you for this day, we thank you for your loving and
goodness to us for watching over some caring for us and for all the many blessings that
you see fit to send our way.
We thank you for the opportunity that you've given to each of us who serve here to represent
the people that send us here, we just ask Lord that you would give us your wisdom, your
guidance, and your direction as we seek to do those things that are in the best interest
of our state, we just ask that you would use us to be vessels of your will and help us
to do all that, please, as you for creating Jesus' name and for his sake, amen.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Before we get started, I want to call on Chairman Martin for an announcement, please.
Mr. Chairman, I want to ask the committee to join me in welcoming Miss Singleton and
a group from King's Academy that are on the wall in the back there through the Capitol
day.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Glad to have y'all visit with us today.
Hope you have a good day.
We've got one little piece of housekeeping we'd like to do before we get started.
like to have a motion to send a Senate bill five back to committee have a motion in a second
it's it's back in the committee okay all right now we're going to hear from anybody who wants
to make a request today and some of the requests that they may not be on your sheets of some 16
bills I think came out yesterday from committees but they won't be on our
sheets until they're reported by this morning when the clerk reads the report
but if anybody's here and they want to ask we want to go ahead and and take
care of that and let them come and ask us one time and do that so let's go ahead
and we'll get started at the center
Good morning Mr. Chairman members of the committee have got two bills on the
Blue sheet for your consideration today on the first page.
I have Senate Bill 1, which started as the fair and safe athletic
opportunities act.
And we have worked with Chairman Bonner and Chairman Irwin to
merge your female sports bill that came out of the house with
Senate Bill 1.
It has been renamed the Riley Gaines Act as originated here in
the house.
We've incorporated a number of other house elements into this
bill.
Specifically, a couple issues having to deal with dressing
and some carve-outs for coaches and athletic trainers
that the house had included.
And the other most significant change in this bill
is we have made this exclusively a sports bill.
As you probably recall, the Riley Gaines Act
and the house touched a number of different code sections,
replacing the word gender with sex,
and we have taken those changes out in Senate Bill 1
and Senate Bill 1 exists currently exclusively
as a sports bill.
Happy answering any questions on that one, Mr. Chairman,
or I can tell you about Senate Bill 140.
Okay, Senator, thank you.
We do have a question.
Whip Park has a question.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Senator Dullesall, is it not true
that there is not a single publicly confirmed instance
of a transgender, studed, and public high school sports
in the state of Georgia?
Good morning, Whip.
Thank you for that question.
That is true.
Good, due to the good work of Representative Will Wade
and Governor Kempif years ago,
we allow the Georgia High School Association
to make this decision by rule.
And so they have made it such by rule
that males are only allowed to participate
in male sports and females participate in female sports.
What we are doing here is two things.
One, we're codifying that for K through 12 in the code,
and we're also expanding that to intercollegiate sports
as well, because as you know here in the state,
we did have an instant that's become quite famous.
Perhaps the case that is the most famous
as it relates to this issue.
So that did take place right here in Georgia and we're looking to this law would address that and what one additional question if I may
Is it not true that this legislation opens up all of our public schools to litigation for again an issue that's already been addressed?
Mr. Whip I there is a private right of action in this bill
There is a complaint process currently in Georgia law that we rolled this up into that is a different change
I didn't highlight it, but thank you for bringing that up
But the House bill addressed this through the Professional Standards Commission.
The Senate bill uses the existing complaint process that already exists in public schools
to have the adjudication for any complaint that would arise in this bill.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay.
Senator, I don't see any other questions.
Okay.
Mr. Chairman, if I may, I also have Senate Bill 140, which is a bill that's very important
to the optometrist.
It's on the top of page three.
This would allow doctors about tomatry to dispense and sell drugs that they have the right
to prescribe currently under law.
This is a good bill for patient access to those drugs and always readily available in the
pharmacy.
Okay.
Don't see any questions.
Thank you, Chairman.
Yes, sir, Senator.
Yes, sir.
Senator.
Morning, Mr. Chairman.
This came back.
Senate Bill 56.
State and demification.
Fund for one.
Fund for one.
Fund for one.
enforcement officers, this bill's already been funded.
In the amended budget, we just passed a few weeks ago,
incentive bill 105, a veterinary, and telehealth bill.
You've already asked for that.
Yeah, just want to come visit you.
Right, just want to remind you, one in you don't have to back,
but we're glad to have you here.
I love you so much.
I'm here again, sir.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Morning, Chairman.
Committee.
I'm here to present Senate Bill 212.
It's at the bottom of page three.
This is the protecting the information of minors and public
schools built during this last campaign cycle.
There were numerous instances of political campaigns and
campaigns and politicians masking is alternate reasons to be in schools and they were actually
harvesting data of minors and then feeding that information directly to the campaigns.
This simply protects the information of students from campaigns illicitly falsely presenting
themselves as something they are not.
fraudulently organized is the key word on line 93 of the bill so any of us are still welcome
and invited come into schools to build a do-butter registrations as long as it's in my invitation
of administration and not under any sort of a false banner. Have the answer any questions?
I have a couple of questions for you. Leader Heagley, you have a question.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So I want to be clear, you're not suggesting that national organizations
such as Outlook Outlook Office Authority of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority would be banned
from doing their traditional voter registration
for seeing years is something they've done.
For years and years and years,
these are not political organizations,
but they do ask to come in there,
they're not necessarily invited.
So you're saying if they're not invited by their schools,
they cannot do that, is that your intent?
No, no, in fact, I could refer you to lines 42 through 55
of the bill, that was an amendment offered
by leader Harold Jones and Senator Kim Jackson to clarify that exact question.
We wanted to make it perfectly clear that organizations that were representing themselves
as such would be able to continue to do that, or that you could even be free to discuss
politics at a Friday night football game.
What you can't do is A.K.A couldn't come in and then say that they were there for a girl
all scout cookie drive, and then get kids contact information and push it out campaigns.
Very different.
Okay.
Well, we'll pour it.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Senator, is it not true that there already exists federal law that provides extensive
protections regarding student information and the prohibition on disclosure of their
information?
You're not alleging that federal law was violated, were you?
No, not alleging anything.
FERPA that you're referring to does prevent the schools from distributing that information.
But what happened in the first, fourth and fifth largest counties in Georgia, some of
which we share, schools that we share candidates were going in under the pretense of doing something
completely different and then giving that information to campaigns.
This is just preventing that from ever happening again.
Last question, would this bill in any way, again, I think, you know, my concern is that it would disincentivize students from engaging in the political process.
I think at least my reading of it is that, again, it should, it's going in the wrong direction, which I would otherwise want to see, of trying to empower and educate students to mean in as opposed to being scared of violating state law.
No, this doesn't do anything to students at all.
This keeps us, the elected officials,
or those that are seeking political office
from doing something to be able to harvest child's data
and then passing it on to campaigns in a very illicit way.
Representative Evans.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, to the author.
I believe in protecting student information.
So I don't have any problem with that.
I do think there are federal rules that apply for it,
but my concern is there are high schools in the state
that have, they have young Republican clubs,
they have young Democrat clubs,
and I'm concerned that the language starting online 92
is gonna sort of open them up to questions
because I'm hoping, and this is a question to you,
I assume, and you can let me know if I'm wrong,
that you're not trying to stop students
from organizing themselves if they wanna talk about candidates,
but since we've got this line 92 that says no candidate,
She'll also listen to any individual to fraudulently organize or aren't we opening up those students
who for their own reasons because they've read something about a candidate and they want
to talk about it at a young Democratic club or a young Republican club.
We're opening them up to questioning such that we might quash their enthusiasm for making
their voices heard through these clubs which I would hope you would not want to stop.
So if you could speak to any of that I would appreciate it.
That's a great question.
So, line 92, no candidate, campaign committee,
or political action committee shall solicit an individual.
That's very different than a club,
young Democrats, young Republicans,
or anything in between,
inviting candidates to be able to come in.
Administration has allowed them entry just as any of us.
If you go to visit a school,
you're coming in there,
you're identifying who you are and what you're doing.
This is very specific to a situation
where candidates were going in setting up
fake voter registration drives in school systems
with the premise that they were coaching students,
minors, to set up voter registration drives
that were never registered or coordinated
with the Secretary of State to actually pass that data
on the State Election Board to register them to vote.
Was there any consideration given to safeguards though
that aren't going to subject students who do organize events
on their own to interrogation from the opposite candidate
to say, didn't this person ask you to do that?
Just calling them in to be subject to extra questioning
that those of us over 18 wouldn't be subject to
if we were holding events.
That's what I'm concerned about.
I don't think the word interrogation exists
anywhere in this billboard.
It does, and I'm asking, if you set up a framework
that you've got on 92, where we're saying
you can't, a campaign can't solicit a student.
To fraud, you'll leave the ordinance.
Let me finish my question.
If you'd let me finish my question,
I'll let you finish your answers.
So if the student organizes their own event for candidate A,
candidate B is thinking, oh, I bet candidate A put them up to it.
And then we've got an interrogation process.
We've likely incentivized that process to the student.
That's what I'm concerned about.
Because how are you going to find out about this fraud
that the student was induced or whatever
from this other candidate?
There's no other way to do it except to ask the student.
That's what I'm concerned about.
Did you all think about that?
We did.
And if you look at the very next line,
because you're taking the sentence out of context,
individual under the age of 18 to fraudulently organize
an event on the property of any local school system
when the purpose of such event is influencing
the nomination for election or election of any person
for office.
I think that answers it pretty well.
But you do acknowledge that you're
saying that right now a student, even under your bill,
If it passed, you wouldn't have any problem with a student or group of students on their
own through a young Democrat club or a young Republican club talking about and supporting
a particular candidate.
That's free speech and they should be encouraged to do so.
Right.
And so how are we going to know the difference between when that's happening and when
they're being pushed by a candidate to do it if we don't allow someone to ask those
students why they're doing it and and how they came to do it and which would
potentially kill them from wanting to have these kind of events which I don't
think we would want to do. That's what I'm concerned about. I represent
it respectfully. I disagree with your premise on it and I think that you're
trying to infer something that's not in the bill. Thank you. We disagree. Okay
Hey, rips any of Williams?
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I think in your long answers, you kind of answered me.
I was concerned because every newborn baby in my district,
when they come into the world, they
get a vote out of William Sticker.
They take home.
As they should.
Chairman Martin, just real briefly,
Isn't it true what your effort is a campaign,
the young Republicans and young Democrats
can still meet on campus if they do it
according to school policies?
Isn't it true now that most schools have policies,
they don't even allow a campaign sign
into a sporting event for a particular candidate?
That's a great point.
Isn't that already the case?
Yes, it is.
That's their policy, I don't know.
And that will continue.
Thank you, Chairman.
Okay, was there another question here wave? Okay, good. No more questions. Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll be brief. Senate Bill 40 is a secondary metal recyclers cleanup bill.
That we need to change some definitions around and we're removing a sunset on a cash provision.
I've got a Senate Bill 148, which allows the Department of Education to initiate a pilot
program for outdoor education space, and then I've already asked for 141, so I won't
ask again, but 141.
Thank you, sir.
Any questions?
Don't see. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for sharing it.
We have to say to God what you got. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It's on the Yellow Sheet page
five. It's HR 347. It's about the fifth or sixth one from the bottom. This is an
urging resolution for Georgia High Schools to start a girls flag football and it
has gotten incredible support across the state. Since we dropped the resolution 34
additional teams that already signed up, and that is just the disresolution.
Okay, I don't see any questions for you, thanks sir.
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Committee, Senate Bill 36, past yesterday in committee will be available
after it's reading today.
It's a bill that takes the same protections for people of faith from unfair federal government
action implies it to the state and local level.
That's what it does.
Glad to think much, okay?
You got a question for you, who apart?
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Senator Setsler, is it not true that there's a very large
distinction between what exists at the federal level
and if this bill moves forward in that this legislation
would serve blatantly as a license to discriminate
because there are no state level civil rights protections.
Is that not true?
Well, you're welcome for having an opportunity
to kind of make that talking point.
The fact is, this does not do that,
what this does is it takes the center road.
There are some states that preempt
local non-scriminational ordinances.
This bill specifically does not do that.
This bill takes the center road, it leaves those in place
and simply provides protection for folks who currently,
there's a whole new laws, as you will know,
that federal civil rights law applies
in every circumstance except,
with respect to individual free exercise,
with respect to state local governments,
and this bill simply patches that.
Senator, I appreciate that talking point
which I disagree with, but is it not true
that based on the facts of where we've seen
this legislation implemented in other states,
it's resulted in broad-based discrimination
against marginalized communities,
against vulnerable communities,
and it's resulted in a lot of chaos
with respect to public safety laws
and other generally applicable neutral laws.
Is that not true?
To the gentleman's question, I would love this committee to have the time.
It does not have to go case by case by case by case.
There's not a single case of that that you could point to by state level refer up in the
country.
In fact, we were very careful working with the governor's team to pass the exact same
language that exists in federal law that's been proven for 32 years that we would ask for
nothing more than nothing less.
Appreciate the question.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, to the author of the author, Mr. Senator.
As I understand it, there was offered in the committee process an amendment that would
include anti-discriminatory language.
Did you support that amendment?
What that amendment was seeking to do was a church and a horse of an amendment.
What it would do is it would completely invalidate any claim of religious exercise against some
allegation, some allegation of discrimination.
What this bill does actually, it's intended to recognize the circumstances, there's a claim of discrimination.
There's a claim of someone's religious rights that balances those circumstances.
To suggest that it's going to be not usable if there's some allegation of discrimination is to make this a one-sided question that deals with exemptions.
All we're seeking to do is in those very difficult circumstances.
We recognize those governmental interests that would prohibit discrimination, and balance
those against someone's religious claim.
We've seen time and again, in fact, the Zanataber Lutheran case, the US Supreme Court.
Someone, the same question was raised, in a 9-0 Supreme Court opinion, where Justice
Kagan actually joined Justice Alita and said the idea that a 1964 Silver Rights Act claim
can operate without any balance to someone's religious rights is nonsense.
Even at the federal level, there's a balancing test.
All this bill does is create a balancing test.
It's not the exemption you're talking about and those that propose that are mischaracterizing
this is an exemption bill.
This is not an exemption bill.
It simply gives the proper way to people's exercise.
OK, I just will respectfully disagree with your characterization.
My second question is, we have first amendment protections
already in place for religious freedom
and to protect religious freedom in this country
that are as old as this country is.
I'm trying to understand why all of a sudden is that not enough.
Great question.
We have full federal protections for freedom of speech,
freedom of assembly, and freedom of press.
But in 1997, the Supreme Court ruled the Bernie V. Flores case
protections for free exercise with respect to impacts
by state and local governments are not protected
by our federal constitution.
That is an indisputable fact.
And that's the reason we have this.
This is the whole in law that only with respect
to free exercise in relation to state and local government
is they're not federal protections.
That's why states specifically have to pass this whole 39 states have done it.
We're one of the 11 of not, and that's that's why we have it before.
Thank you, thank you to the speaker and thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I look forward to looking at that case and
if appropriate, responding in a different form.
Thank you.
Bernie V. Forrest 1997.
I'll find it.
Leader Heagley.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, to the senator.
This is not the first rodeo with this.
So tell me what has happened in Georgia since 2016
that necessitates that we do this now.
Give me some examples of what we're fixing.
Fortunately, in 2018, we had an election
where Governor Brian Kemp won by 55,000 votes.
When COVID came along and you look around
other states, you look at California in particular,
you had a California governor that said
People of faith could not sing in their churches
because the expelling of vapor from their mouths
created too much of a risk of COVID,
even if they're socially distanced.
You had people of faith in California, for example,
who couldn't gather in church yards.
You had people in Mississippi,
churches predominantly of color,
who couldn't gather in their cars together as a body
because local governments tried to shut them down
from sitting in their cars to be together as a church body.
Fortunately in Georgia, we had a governor
that didn't shut our state down,
that we saw during COVID that other states,
there were significant impacts on people's basic religious rights.
Thankfully, we didn't have those in Georgia,
and we're trying to prevent that from happening.
Peractively by putting something in place,
the other states were religious protections were protected.
Didn't see these kinds of violations.
But other non-refer states we saw with executives
who were indifferent to people's basic rights,
there were big violations
and we're seeking to protect that.
to the speaker, let me just say that if we're going to talk about COVID, we've got to talk
about how many people who died because they didn't abide by the rules that were put
in place and they died from singing in the choir right next to somebody else. They died
of sitting in the pews. So let's just not go there.
Okay.
Mr. Evans, did you have a question?
No, see any other questions? Thank you.
Thank you.
Are there any requests from committee members?
Okay, I don't see any.
This morning we were just going to do hearings only to hear
having any requests.
There'll be more coming out when the clerk makes his report
today and we'll have that.
But for the members, if you would please see Ms. Lewis,
she has something for each of you.
Just no rush about it, but just when you have time she's over here now if you want to see her or but whatever if you would please see her
Thank you, and we're adjourned
