Well good morning. Good morning. Members of your please come to the floor. I think the rules committee has arrived on the floor so we'll get this party started. They're talking there. We'll get this thing started. Get all of them in here a second minute. Go ahead and make a set the home for a minute and we'll get started. Well good morning members. The hour convening having arrived. All members all members will please come to the floor and take their seats. Miss Clarence will you ring the bell. We're going to have the morning row call. Morning row call. All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber. And Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machines. We represent your hear兒. have all members now voted? Have all members registered their attendance today? I think you have. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machines? Are keepers, will you please close the doors and keep them closed? As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by our Chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our Chaplain this morning, a pretty special day for him. I'll let him tell you how he knows this gentleman who our Chaplain is, but we're going to allow the gentleman from the 144th House District representing Dale Washburn to introduce our Chaplain of the Day, representing Washburn. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, in the House, it is an honor for me today to introduce our Chaplain of the Day, the Reverend Kim Washburn. I also would like to introduce his wife Susan, who is sitting over here, just next to my wife Donna, and also a member of his staff is with us today. Jamie Bailey is his children's director, his church, and her daughter Bristol is with us today. It is a special honor for me to introduce this gentleman. I have known him all of his life, because I remember the day he was born in June of 1962, because I'm his oldest brother, and he is my youngest brother. So I'm honored to introduce him today. Kim is the pastor of Greenwood Baptist Church in Jones County, which is part of my district. He has also been there for six years. He is also a member of the Jones County Board of Education. He called me one day, Mr. Speaker, and he said, they want me to run for the Board of Education, and I don't know if I should or not. I said, well, absolutely you should, and I encouraged him to do that. But Mr. Speaker, he didn't have any opposition. He got elected with no opposition. I've never been that fortunate. He always had to work hard to get elected. But he is a member of the school board, and he brings a good common sense in his service there to the Jones County Board of Education. Very quickly, his story as a pastor is an interesting story. He was a businessman. He had operated his successful business for many years, and he continued to feel the call to the ministry. The church he attended needed an associate pastor, and he volunteered to do it for no pay. I don't feel that role, but I don't want any pay. I'll just serve as that. The pastor left to go to another pastor. They asked him to be the interim pastor, and then after six months, they issued a call to him to be the permanent pastor. So my brother Kim is a good man. He serves God because he's called to do it. He breaches the truth to the people there, and he takes good care of them. And so I am honored to introduce my brother Kim Washburn as our chaplain of the day. Good morning. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this invite and this opportunity today. I've got to tell you all I've never expected to be standing before such a powerful and influential group, but here I stand. Just so you know, Dale has already told you, he is my oldest brother. I am honored that he's my brother, and I have learned so much from him in life. I've had the opportunity to watch him be a husband to his wife, a father to his children, and I've watched him be a man of faith for my entire life. I don't think I would have had this opportunity in the end the reason except for I'm Dale's brother, so I thank him as well. I've really been thinking and praying about what I would say today, and this is it. You may not be blown away by this. You may think this is pretty straightforward, but I am for sure a very simple man. My word to you today is, do good. That's it. Do good. You see, I believe that we're made for purpose. I believe that God has a plan for each one of us, and I believe that each of you are not here by chance. I want you to listen as I read Galatians 6, verse 9 and 10, and this is what it says, and let us not grow weary of doing good. For in due season we will reap if we do not give up. So then as we have the opportunity, let us do good to everyone, and especially to those who are in the household of faith. See for me this is really simple. I believe that God's Word is true. I based my life on that. I believe that I was called by a holy God to speak the truth. And I believe in Galatians 6, verse 9 and 10, it confirms that we should be people if we follow Christ, who certainly tries to do good. Hear me today, you have been in a place in this position where you have the power to make change happen. You have the power to do good. I don't want you to misunderstand me. I know that you all do a lot of good. I know that you all do a lot of good work. Much. My challenge for you today, my encouragement for you today is to start every day with that approach. You should approach this calling and brothers and sisters, it's calling. You should approach it every day with humble hearts. You can make a difference. There's still a lot of disadvantaged people in the world. There's a lot of elderly people that struggle. You can always restore hope to the people who have no hope. So my challenge today is do good. When my Savior Jesus Christ was asked the greatest commandment, he said this. And I paraphrase, love God with everything that you have. And when asked what was second to that, he said, love your neighbor as yourself. For us who call Jesus Christ Lord, and I do, we should put these commands in action every day. And when we do, we'll do good. I appreciate this opportunity. I hope I have stayed within my five minutes. And it is the honor to be here today. And if you would stand and pray with me, I would appreciate it. Our most gracious Heavenly Father, I thank you today for this opportunity to come to our state capital. I thank you for the men and women in this room who sacrificed and diligently worked to make our state a better place. I thank you for this speaker and all the people that work with him. And God today here in this room, where so many things have happened for our state, I ask you to bless and protect these people. I ask for their hearts to turn towards you. I ask for their prayer lives to be real. And God, I ask that they work humbly to serve the state that they've been elected to state to serve. You are a good, good Father, a gracious Lord. And I thank you today that you have provided for me salvation. And I pray all of this in the most powerful and blessed name of Jesus Christ. And if you will now join me for the pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands. One nation, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Thank you, brother. You came. That was good. You came well with it. Do I see it? Doorkeeper, you may unlock the doors. Brother Kim, we appreciate you and the family being with us today. And thank you for that message. And you're exactly right. We do appreciate you. Now we're going to ask the members of joining you in that south any room and say hello and get some photos. Thank you. Thank you. Members, our doctor of the day today is Dr. Cody Gunn brought to us by Representative Houston Gaines. Dr. Gunn is downstairs in the aid station. If you did his services, I'm sure he'll be glad to see you. Dr. Gunn, thank you for being here with us and serving the house and seeing it and this building today.

Good morning colleagues. Today, I am honoring the life of Mr. Cornelius Taylor, the life and memory of Cornelius Taylor, a man whose presence left a mark on the hearts of all who had the privilege of knowing him. With deep sadness, we mourn his untimely death at an unhoused encampment on January 16th. But most importantly, we celebrate the remarkable life he lived in the powerful legacy he leaves behind. Born in October, on October 8th, 1978 in Walton County, Georgia, Mr. Taylor was a man of many talents. He was not just someone in the neighborhood, he was part of the fabric of the community, a presence as steady and warm as the morning sun. He engaged with his community, participated in local events and found spiritual grounding at Ebenezer Baptist Church, a church that holds deep meaning in Atlanta's history and Mr. Taylor's life. While some may have seen him as unhoused, those who truly knew Mr. Taylor saw a pillar of strength, a friend, a neighbor and a beaker-beaking of resilience. May we carry forward his spirit by seeing the humanity in one another, by lifting up everyone around us, by living with the same integrity and grace that defined Cornelius Taylor's life. And today we have his family in the gallery. May his family stand. Sorry, they're up on the right. I thank you all for coming and I graduated from Joy Hill's High School in Decap County from with his brother and sister. So I appreciate y'all coming and thank you Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Thank you Representative and thank you family for being here as well. Thank you members. Representative Yerter is recognized for a morning order. Thank you Mr. Speaker. We got a great group from Lee County here with us today, the Lee County Youth Ambassadors. The Youth Ambassador Program is a collaborative effort between Lee County Family Connection, Lee County School System, Lee County Chamber Commerce, Lee County Library and the City of Leedsburg and Lee County Board of Commissioners.

They're provided with opportunities to volunteer in the community and encourage to incubate and implement community projects that encourage civic awareness. Last year they are introduced to local government. Today they are here to learn about state government and it's the goal of their program to create a culture of community commitment.

They're important part of the house. Thank you for being with us today. Members, that concludes our morning orders. We'll move on to. We'll move on to the rules calendar. Mr. Clerk, would you read the caption to Senate Bill 154 154 Senate about 154 by Senator Hatchett of the 50th and others to be entitled to amend titles 20 35 and 43. The official go to Georgia and tentative relating to education law enforcement officers and agencies and professions and businesses respectively. Those revise or remove references to the United States Department of Education from the official code of Georgia and tentative. This bill then referred to the committee on education. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. The good Nick is recognized to present the bill. Members, if you give the gentleman your well, you're attention. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I bring Senate Bill 154 this morning, a truly simple bill that abends 25 different code sections in our code by adding or its successor in reference to the United States Department of Education and online 65 and 66 just simply updates outdated language to bring FAFSA into modernize our case. The speaker, that's the bill. Be happy to stand for any questions. You have a question, representing Sanchez to your right. His recognize for a question. Gentlemen recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, I do. So this bill is, I'm assuming are you doing this because you believe that the Department of Education is going to be removed. It's going to be again rid of. Thank you for the question. So the president and Congress have made it their intent and stated their intent to executive order was signed yesterday for the U.S. Department of Education to be removed. All we're doing is updating. Be happy to share these 25 code sections with you so that we don't find ourselves in our code in a situation where we're out of date, not in compliance. So we're going to do things licensing if you're a professional. It has to do with your licensing so we want to stop hard work in Georgians from being able to get their licensing. All right, does the gentleman for the U.S. Department of Education hasn't been rid of yet because executive order is not a legal way to actually get rid of it correct. The executive order has been signed and I'd prefer to get this done here during this session and not in a special session when our business owners and those who need to be licensed across the state of Georgia are calling us and asking us why they can't go to work. Thank you. Gentlemen, take a couple other questions. One more, Mr. Speaker. I was even talented up the center aisle on your right. Yes, right there. Is it not true that this is being proactive for the state of Georgia and Georgia is actually getting ahead of the game, getting that game planning ahead and doing the right thing to protect our citizens in Georgia? Gentlemen, those are what you speak. Mr. Speaker, thank you for your time this morning. I'll ask for this body's favorable consideration on Senate Bill 154. I'm a geol to the well. We have one member who signed up to speak to the bill who's opposed. That's representative Vermont. Good. Ladies, don't speak in favor of the bill. Can we follow them on drink or is that not to make you? Well, you got to done that too. But I did outrun you. You remember that. I did. No, you didn't. Anyways, thank you, Mr. Speaker. The lady's recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I am in favor of this bill, but I did want us to be honest about why we need a bill like this and talk through some potential ramifications are coming down the pipeline. I want to be clear. I'm glad we're being proactive. It's actually a great thing when our bodies are able to work together from across the hall all the way to here to do something that not only is going to fix a problem, but also prevent it. But the reality of the situation is that this is something I brought up a few times this session and I think it's starting to annoy some of you, but it's true. There is so much uncertainty right now because of the federal government and nobody should have to live with that kind of uncertainty. There are parents who don't know if their kids are going to have the resources they need to succeed in school let alone thrive. There are parents who are trying to figure out how to plan to make sure their children who require different types of assistance from the federal government, whether it's the education department or other people. The other departments who are unsure how to move forward. And the reality of the situation is that when you walk into the government with a business mindset of move fast and break things, what you do is you hurt people. As much as I wish that government should be like businesses and its efficiency, a lot of these redundancies are actually really crucial to maintaining the integrity of the programs and their consistencies over time. And that's the reality. Not only are we going to be seeing a dismantling of the Department of Education, which is illegal, I want to be very clear. A president cannot unilaterally get rid of an agency that is literally not allowed. It's not that the courts are opposed because of political reasons. It's just the way the government works. And with a bill like this one, we are getting ahead on some of these issues. We are going to provide some stability to parents. But the reality is they shouldn't need it to begin with. And that's what really gets me is that we are now having to deal with issues and work on issues that we shouldn't have to, even in the limited time that we already have. So now instead of dealing with the already growing backlog of problems that Georgians have, we are now seeing an even bigger backlog because of the chaos on the federal level. And I want to touch on something that's really personal to me, which is student financial aid. As you know, and I've shared this with many of you in the crowd, I am somebody who took out student loans and I've paid them aggressively. But the reality situation is right now, I do not know how much I owe. I literally don't know. My loan service provider doesn't really know. There's nobody really at the part of education that really knows because of all the chaos happening at the federal level. And I'm not the only one. There are recent graduates, older graduates, you name it, who are unable to properly financially plan because of that chaos. So not only is this touching people in their education, not only is this touching people, you know, when it comes to prepping for their kids, it's also touching people in their pocketbooks. So one, thank you to those who brought this bill forward for being proactive in setting a really great example. But two, I sincerely hope that as we see more and more of these bills and these efforts that we start to one, rethink how we view government. Yes, it can be and should be more efficient. Yes, we should always be improving on it. I firmly believe that citizens should have the best customer service experience when they interact with their governments. And we can't do it in a really chaotic way. So thank you colleagues for giving me a moment to talk about that. Thank you to the bill sponsors for bringing this forward. And thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield the will. Ladies, you are the will. Representative David Wilkerson has recognized speaking favor of the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I come down today and I want to thank not just the author of the bill, but both the Democrats and Republicans that serve in the Education Committee. When this bill came from the Senate, we did what we do many times. We hopefully perfect it because it was not a bipartisan bill when it left the Senate. By adding the fact that this only takes effect if the Department of Education goes away, that changes a lot of things for a lot of people. The reality is that what's going on in DC is kind of like the weather in the last week in Georgia. We got a high 80 and a low of 30. There's a lot of change and the only thing that you know is if you don't take care of yourself, you're going to get sick. And so what we're trying to do is take care of Georgia by doing this bill right now. I want to thank the chairman of the Education Committee. I want to thank my colleagues in the House and I want to thank the author for taking the amendment. And with that, I would ask everybody to support this bill and make sure that we continue to take care of Georgia as the way we should. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I yield the will. Jim, as you do the will, leader of the stretching is recognized speaking to Senate bill 154. I suppose you're speaking favor as well. Yes, sir. I am. Well, thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I felt it necessary for me to get up here and just correct the record about something as has been referenced. We often see.

policy decisions that are debated, discussed, and then acted upon in Washington, D.C. And our responsibility is Georgia legislators in our federal assistant, where we have different levels of government, our federal government taking certain action, which we may be able to foresee and anticipate. We may, it may be uncertain to us as we're a part-time legislature. We may be out of session when action is taken. And this is a circumstance where legislation has been brought in consideration of what the President of the United States has proposed now through an executive order, with to correct the record of that's been said from this well here, that is not unilateral action. There's acknowledgement that Congress will have to act on that. But if Congress does act before we are back in session in January, 2026, we will have taken necessary steps to make sure that our code is updated. And I believe that this is an opportunity for us to reflect our priority and focus on the education of Georgia students and to embrace this not with uncertainty, but with confidence. This is going to allow an opportunity to continue to prioritize students, educators, and professionals in Georgia classrooms. It's going to give an opportunity to ensure that every license, every training program, and institution in this state that provides education is able to function smoothly and effectively. Colleagues, we agree that education is foundational to Georgia's success. In Senate Bill 154, it's an opportunity for us to show that we are putting in place smart and efficient frameworks to ensure that we respect local priorities that we preserve continuity in our educational system, and to even open the doors for innovation into the future. I feel very strongly that this is a measure worthy of our support here today, and what I've heard from the other speakers is that that's of a, that we're of a like-mind. But with respect, we shouldn't expand this to other political discussions here today. This is about prioritizing education in the state of Georgia, which we are able to do today in a bipartisan basis with a green vote on SB 154, not urge your favorable consideration. Thank you, Ms. Speaker. I yield the well. Gentlemen, as yield to the well, we have no further speakers on the bill. Is any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Here in none, the committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none, the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes, all those opposed we'll vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? Yes, sir. Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the passage of Senate bill 154, the yeas are 144, the nays are 15. This bill, having received a requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption of Senate bill 9696? Senate bill 96 by the senator's act, most of the 49th and others to be entitled, not to amend various titles of the official code of Georgia, annotated, so to modernize and update provisions, creating certain boards, panels, authority, centers, commissions, committees, councils, task force, and others such bodies. This bill, I'm referring to the committee on code revision, that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Representative Matthew Gamble is recognized to present Senate bill 96, representative Gamble. Thank you, Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. Today, I bring you Senate bill 96 on behalf of the Governor. This is a substitute, and this bill seeks to do two things. Number one, this will reduce administrative burden on state agencies by reducing the number of boards that have grown inactive or perform duplicative roles. And number two, it will restructure certain boards to function more efficiently. Now, the bill will repeal the following councils, the Environmental Advisory Council, the Jekyll Island Citizens Resource Council, the State Holder Advisory Council, the Governor's Office for Children and Families Advisory Board, the Georgia Volunteer Fire Service Council, the Paliative Care and Quality of Life at Advisory Council, the Board of Homeland Security, the Employment First Georgia Council, the Georgia State Games Commission, the Lottery Retailer Advisory Board, and those were, again, all inactive or never met, and the responsibilities of those boards will be assumed by other entities that are either duplicative or exist in another form. There were two smaller changes made in this sub. The State Housing Trust Fund for the Homeless Commission and the Georgia Council on Lupus Education and Awareness will not be revealed, repealed, but they will be revised. The State House Trust for the Homeless Commission is included to rectify an issue in filling vacancies in an expired terms. There will be an additional board seats added for the commission. And the Georgia Council on Lupus Education and Awareness will be moved administratively to the Department of Public Health to make recommendations on the distributions of funds designated for Lupus Education, Awareness, and Research. So those are the things that were revised in the bill. And one other change on the Georgia Firefighter Standards and Training Council, there will be a volunteer firefighter added to that board to ensure that volunteer departments are always represented on that council. So that is in essence what this bill does. And again, I'm happy to answer any questions that there may be on Senate Bill 96. And gentlemen, how's a couple of questions? Ripley Scofield has recognized for a question to your right. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Parliamentary inquiry? No. No, you just asked him a question. He'll answer. Sorry about that. Is it not, yeah, does gentleman yield? I yield. Is it not true that we worked hard and the council was never dead or needed to be revised? It was just located in the wrong place. It was housed under DCH and we had to move it under DPH and I appreciate all the work that everyone is done to get this settled. That is correct. And we appreciate you and work to make sure because that's something that you have helped us be very proactive with since I and you both were elected in this chamber and I appreciate your work to raise awareness for Lupus and we want to make sure that that remains a priority with what we're doing here. Further question? And is it not sure that the house looks great when they put on a purple? They look great when they put on their purple. That's correct. Thank you. Good question. Good answer. Is represented Campbell to your left as recognized for a question? Representative, Lisa Campbell. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? I just have a question. You had mentioned that the councils that have been repealed their roles and responsibilities would be taken over by other entities. Would you mind for the shortlist that you read relating to us which entities will take over each role and responsibility? I would be happy to the environmental advisory council that has been active for an over a decade. The EPD will assume their responsibilities. The Jekyll Island Citizens Resource Council has been inactive since its inception and the Jekyll Island Authority will assume their responsibilities. The stakeholder advisory council performs limited tasks that will be absorbed by the erosion and sediment control advisory council. The governor's office for children and families has not been an active agency for over six years and all their responsibilities have been absorbed by DHS. The governor's office for children and families advisory board will be dissolved and as a result, the agency being dissolved. The de-facts state advisory board which advises de-facts on the needs of Georgia's foster care system will assume those responsibilities. As I mentioned, the Georgia Volunteer Fire Service Council has been inactive since its inception and so the Georgia Firefighters Standards and Training Council which has always performed the Volunteer Council's responsibilities. They will assume that with the change of adding a requirement that a volunteer firefighter has to have a seat on that council and there are several others but I hope I address and I didn't know if there might be a specific one you had a question about but yeah thank you. With that Mr. Speaker, I would ask for this body's favorable consideration and I yield the well. Thank you for your presentation and your answer as the gentleman is yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered here in none the previous question is ordered is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Here in none the committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none the report the committee's agreed to. Shout this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes all those opposed will vote no and Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? All members voted. If so Mr. Clerk will you lock the machine? On the passage of Senate bill 96 the yeas are 162 the nays are zero this bill haven't seen the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk will you read the caption of Senate bill 5858.

perform certain duties in connection with projects related natural gas facilities this bill having been referred to the committee on energy utilities and telecommunications that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute representative angio sting is recognized to present the bill represent you know steam thank you mr. speaker I bring before you senate bill 13 it was authored by my senator and it came as a recommendation from the rule development council for the past two years the Georgia environmental finance authority offers low interest financing for water sewer resiliency and disaster mitigation projects to local governments senate bill 13 would make natural gas infrastructure projects eligible for low interest sorry low interest jeep of financing Douglas and coffee county where I live is out of capacity we can no longer attract any industry with a natural gas requirement due to the lack of capacity this capacity is tied to the Albany Douglas lateral gas line that is in desperate need of repair senate bill 13 would give Douglas coffee county an additional tool to help finance the needed upgrades the house energy utilities and telecom community added it language to include the conversion of electric lines to underground given the experience of my community during hurricane haline this measure will assist south Georgia and the state with electrical grid resiliency with that mr. speaker I'll yield for a couple of questions lady has no questions but we do have some speakers on the bill but lady has no questions thank you mr. speaker I yield the well ladies yielded the well I'm going to recognize represent for a mine to speak to the bill then represent your dinner they're speaking as well representative for mine thank you mr. speaker colleagues to be quiet on with you I don't fully haven't fully decided having a lean on this until the vote happens but there is something that really concerns me about this bill which is the piece on natural gas all session we've talked a lot about cost shifting between consumers and the public to private etc and I don't think that this is the body to be helping natural gas companies at the same time we do have communities that really need this because of hurricane haline the reality the situation is that far too often in this chamber we do tend to prioritize companies when we make these kinds of decisions and it's really really disappointing but there's also a moment to help a community and so I'm frankly rising here today to show you that this is a moment where we are having to seem like we're doing something good but it might be incentivizing corporations to expand for example their reliance and their use of natural gas if it was up to me I'd be relying on more sustainable forms of energy where the local community wouldn't need a bill like this and my hope is that as we continue to work on these issues we make our community is more weather resilient because hurricane haline isn't going to be the only hurricane that is going to hit our state as much as it I wish it was that is not the case and so my hope is that instead of continuing to do these band-aids and continuing to sort of one give money to these corporations that do contribute to a lot of these weather patterns that instead we start to think about how do we also work on prevention and strengthening our infrastructure on the front end so you know this is one of those moments where this is going to be a vote that I'm going to keep weighing but I do appreciate the need for the community I also do appreciate that we're going to be bearing power lines because again that's a proactive measure that we need to be doing but I do want to invite this body to please consider weather proving and weather strengthening our infrastructure so we don't have to keep doing this year after year thank you mr. Speaker I yielded well ladies you're the way a rippling driller is recognized to speak to Senate bill 13 rippling a Carla driller give the lady your attention please represent your driller good morning mr. Speaker ladies and gentlemen today arise in opposition to Senate bill 13 this bill represents a misguided expansion of the Georgia Environmental Finance Authorities Mission pushing our state government into an area best managed by the private sector and local authorities this is not just bad policy it is government overreach wrapped in the guise of infrastructure investment first and foremost let us not forget why tifa was established tifa was created to manage federal funding for drinking water and wastewater projects it was never intended to become a clearinghouse for natural gas infrastructure in fact there are no federal funds designated for natural gas projects within tifa's mandate we are already struggling to meet funding needs for vital water projects with the applications for clean water state revolving fund and the drinking water revolving fund exceeding the funding limit by hundreds of millions of dollars diverting resources to natural gas particularly with clean energy projects are already under threat is short-sighted more over this bill would insert state government into areas where the private sector is fully capable of managing supply distribution and financing let's be clear natural gas is a commercial commodity and private companies already have the expertise and capacity to develop and maintain this infrastructure why should the state take on financial burdens and risk that are better managed by the private sector this is not about promoting economic development it's about government intrusion into a market that does not need it and while proponents claim that varying power lines as a part of gf's mission will make our state more resilient i urge caution federal resilience funding is uncertain at best and we should not be rushing to over extend gf's responsibilities without a clear and sustainable funding strategy let's also examine the motivation behind this bill this is not a grassroots movement driven by local governments or the people of Georgia instead it's driven by the municipal gas authority of Georgia seeking to use state resources to prop up its own business interest this is not sound policy and it is not in the best interest of our citizens let us not forget that we have been down this road before the predecessor to this bill was hb1294 and it failed for good reasons even the way in the waiting hours of last session desperate attempts to tie it to other legislation could not salvage its flawed premise now we are seeing the same proposal resurrected but the underlying issues have not changed this bill is nothing more than government overreach disguised as economic development it risk public resources to benefit a few special interest while doing nothing to truly modernize our energy infrastructure or secure long-term sustainability i urge you to vote no on sb13 and key gf focused on its original mission protecting our water resources and promoting environmental stewardship thank you ladies you're the well chairman corbid is recognized to speak to senate bill 13 chairman corbid thank you mr. speaker colleagues i rise today to express my strong support for senate bill 13 this is a pivotal piece of legislation that seeks to empower the Georgia environmental finance authority jeep of to finance and oversee projects related to natural gas facilities this bill represents a forward-thinking approach to bolstering our state's energy infrastructure and ensuring a reliable and sustainable energy future for all Georgians natural gas is long been a cornerstone of Georgia's energy landscape providing a cleaner burning and efficient source of power for our homes businesses and industries by enabling jeepa to actively participate in the financing management of natural gas projects we're taking a decisive step toward modernizing our energy infrastructure this modernization is crucial not only for meeting the growing energy demands of our state but also maintaining our competitiveness in the ever-evolving energy market you know it's talked about this is just for companies only that that's not true there's five counties in this state that has no natural gas i represent one in counties this is critical to them it just gives us another tool in the toolbox to be able to get that funding they need to help with other finance to be able to get a gas line run to the county it's very expensive to get the line there once they have the line then economic development can come but you can't until you have the the gas there

Chances for economic development in that county is very limited. So I ask you please support this bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker Gentlemen you go you you and the well you're taking a question All right we'll let you answer one of you have one Representative Martin to your right is recognized for a question Gentlemen for question It isn't true since the previous speaker brought up 1294 from last year if the gentlemen would agree with me that That bill did come before this body and I'm looking here on February 29th 2024 it passed this body I believe exactly the same language that's in the portion that deals with gas 155 to 7 is that not true? That is correct this is bill that our friend Clay Parkal brought last year It's very much needed and it came about from the Rule of development council and I've been on for the last seven years This is a recommendation that come from the rule of development council and again. I will appreciate you supporting and thank you for the question Gentlemen yield for a yield of the well. Okay that time you minute You Will Berchett is recognized to speak to Senate bill 13. We're prepared Thank you Mr. Speaker Just to put before you the reason the bill came I represent Cal if the county and as was mentioned up here This is to allow for jeephittal loan for gas natural gas infrastructure for municipalities for Minispal is that deliver those services to our Georgians it is not for a private company or private industry in fact the private industry gas industry and the Georgia municipal association have come together and said worked out the issue with the territory of the private industry so that they're not infringing on them and this Simply folks this is simply just to allow for These municipal gas companies to be able to borrow money to increase the capacity so they can deliver more services to their citizens And that's that's really it. There's no nefarious activity here. I don't believe this is governor You know government overreach. This is allowing Georgians to be able to have more access to gas It was a recommendation by the rule rule development council Again, I don't believe there's any nefarious activity at whatsoever here. This is for Georgians to be have access to gas and With that Mr. Speaker Also, I wanted to say that earlier this session February 20th this bill passed House bill 51 120 to 55 in this chamber so it was you know not even as far back as last year we passed this measure already one time I Respectfully request if you want to support Georgians and their ability to access the gas through a Georgian municipal association Please vote for the bill Thank you have questions of your yielding what do you question? You're telling us when you go for a question represent to heftner to your left The back is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield I do Isn't not true that in Augusta Richmond County I represent a district that has over 500 billion dollars of Infrastructure in development However, I do not have the infrastructure to support new housing with this bill not support An area like mine to allow for the utility infrastructure in order to build to accommodate Housing for those new jobs in my area. Yeah, I believe it would Thank you very much sir for the bill. Thank you for the question The gentleman deal for a question from uh chair lady hagan to your right. I do you sir Do you deal for a question? Yes, yes Would you agree that Those that live in rural Georgia are equally as important as those who live in suburban and urban areas of the state? I agree entirely would you jail for another question? I do do you also agree that Given the rural Geography the isolated often geography of many areas of rural Georgia that we have unique Concerns and challenges when it comes to meeting the needs of our constituents. I agree who hardly is it? Do you agree that this bill is needed because our Communities need access to natural gas in order to operate and Have development investors Opportunities for the people that we represent and that is why we this this bill is crucial for the development of our rural economy I 100% agree and just to put it in simple terms essentially what we have By the time the the gas infrastructure gets down to where we are the pipe is so small We only have a we have a limited capacity so what we're trying to do is allow for mechanism for a Georgia municipal association to Upsize that pipe so that we can put more people on gas and that's that's the simplicity of the bill Thank you mr. Speaker. I appreciate you'll do well General is yielded the well That completes our discussions to this point on Senate bill 13 So is any objection to the previous question me in order? Here in none the previous question is ordered is any of objections to adopting the committee's substitute Here in none the committee's substitute is adopted Is any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill Here in none the report the committee is agreed to you shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill Will vote yes all those opposed will vote no and mr. Clerk will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted For what purposes represent the book neurise parliamentary inquiry State you inquiry Isn't it true that I live in an extremely small Leap populated area of the state that's very true Isn't it further true that when our gas situation in two of our very small cities Was in jeopardy of being able to stay in compliance with all the rules and regulations with their local gas local city gas owned companies That private companies came and helped them out and they have been great partners for our community and have supplied our citizens I'm sure the lady knows what she speaks Further inquiry one more. This is all this is the point. I really want to make with all the interest in Picking places for data centers in our state I feel that this bill puts our water resources in jeopardy even further because of the tremendous amount of water that data centers use and that if we have them diverted to doing gas that can be done by the private sector We may be sorry. Thank you Thank you for the inquiry and I'll just say that Every community is different Nor does needs are and what the opportunities are and we're having a robust discussion around our resources Energy and natural resources through a commit a process. We're working through with our working group For what purposes cheerly. He can't rise Parliamentary inquiry stage inquiry isn't it true that jeep loans are just that their loans that municipalities and governments take out to do specific projects to improve Infrastructure and they are repaid to jeep us so in the future more fraud projects can be funded I think the ladies up to date in his red domain.

So on your desk You have an agree here this morning, so I'm gonna recognize Rips any perchette for a motion rift any perchette Thank you mr. Speaker I make a motion that we agree to the Senate substitute to house bill 223 Mr. Clerk will you read the caption House bill 223 by reps in a percent of the hundred and seventy six to be entitled back to them in total 48 the fiscal to Georgia Antietta relating to revenue and taxation so it's exclude from the calculation of taxable net income Certain disaster relief for assistance grant program payments No recognized We're a barchette to explain the Senate substitute President perchette Thank you mr. Speaker colleagues I have before you house bill 223 if you recall this is a part of the hurricane Helene recovery package Specifically addresses issues for farmers and foresters in the Senate What the Senate added to the provision was a piece that allows for a a To postpone or do away with the severance tax For all these affected counties the severance taxes the tax that counties collect when you cut your trees because they're not they're not When you cut your trees the counties get a dollar Tax based on the volume of the of the trees cut And what this does is suspend that tax but it allows for the Department of Revenue to reimburse Those counties for that lost revenue and the reason that this is important is that if we were to at this point Utilize the severance tax the counties would receive actually less money because the value of the product is much less now because of the damage And the flood on the market what this will do is the last three years average price is what the counties will be reimbursed that Is the addition of what they sent it made to house bill 223 and I'll stand for questions mr. mr. Speaker Minority leader hewglies recognize for a question right that in front of you Thank mr. Speaker this is gentleman yield. Yes, ma'am. What is the additional cost to the state For the add-on from the Senate. I don't I don't have the additional cost all right right now I do not have the additional cost. I apologize, but I can get it to you. I will get it to you. There is a fiscal note on the bill We're gonna have to hear your left is recognized for question. Thank you mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes Is it not true that this bill provides additional measures for timber farmers like those that were affected in my area Due to hurricane Helene where they would otherwise have not received compensation from their insurance provider Or prevents them from having to now go into some sort of litigation I yeah, I very much agree with that Thank you, sir Yeah, I want to make sure to be clear What I said earlier severance tax is Calculated based on the value of the wood that's why it's in not on the volume of the wood So that's why it's important that I believe that we pass the bill so the counties Get more than what the reduced value is because of the damage of the trees and mr. Speaker if there's no more questions You're the well. Do you have a question you can you or the well whatever you'd like to dig? I'd take one more question Grimsy Jasmine Clark to your left is recognized for a question Thank you mr. Speaker does the gentleman yield yes, man So you mentioned that we are basically suspending this tax is there a sunset on the suspension or is it indefinite? Oh, yeah, thank you for bringing that up Representative this we're suspending the tax only for the final quarter of 2024 and for 2025 and this is also a Permissive by the local municipality or or local governing authority. They do not have to suspend the tax But it is their best interest to suspend the tax, but yes, man. That's a very good question. Thank you General has one more question ribosing chas cannon to your right would be your last question. Does German yield Just yeah, you covered the last point, but I want to make sure that clarifies this point This is optional not required for counties to participate in Yes, sir, and I know the gentleman knows well of what this bill does.

afternoon orders in the late morning time let's get her done so we're going to begin with the representative mag jacks and representing jacks and recognize for an order give the gentleman the well your attention please thank you miss speaker lazy gentleman i have in my hand a copy of the constitution of united states of america and the thirteenth amendment says neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime where the parties shall have been duly convicted shall exist within the united states or any place subject to their jurisdiction now yesterday a distinguished member a colleague of this house told me that she had given me a contribution as she said it was so much rage and anger until i heard all i heard was the word hate and here in hate it took me back to growing up in the sixties when hate was seen and heard her anger and rage reminded me of bull corner it reminded me of George Wallace it reminded me of colored water fountains white water fountains in back rooms and then i realized that some were in her subconscious mind she thought that she had bought me and my freedom to choose i looked at the definition for hate and it says intense or passionate dislike for someone extreme dislike or disgust to despise well i gave her her money back because i don't want anyone to think that they own me and can talk down to me as if i'm a child the change in shackles that she thought that she had on me had to be broken because in that very instance i realized that she only tolerated me as long as i went along to get along i was never allowed to be free then another distinguished colleague colleague approached me and let me know how much money she brought she had given me and i think she think that she bought me too with a check but she'll get her money back too i was reading the narrative of the life of Frederick Douglass and i saw where he had to pay for his freedom twice but then i got a note this warning from another very distinguished colleague and the notes said please refund me the campaign contribution i made to you and i'll do that i'll refund everything because i don't ever want anybody think that they own me you see i'm very confused because when i came in here i thought i was coming in to represent the people of district 128 i would be their voice in the Georgia General Assembly and i have all these people that have been meeting with me and talking to me about issues and i thought that i could be that voice when they talk to me but i need i need remedia legislative 101 because i don't understand what's going on then one colleague asked me how much were you given or how much did they offer you well i mean i must be the dumbest person in here because i didn't get anything but i'm still wondering why people think that they can own other people when slavery was outlawed by the 13 amendment and when we were in the civil rights movement we used to say before i be a slave i'll be buried in my grave and go home to my lord and be free thank you misspeak i yield the well thank you representative he is yielded the well after his afternoon order we're representing a hearing representing parish and

barriers recognize for an order present berry thank you mr speaker i rise today not as a legislator not even as a teacher but as someone who simply believes in the american dream it is no surprise that's such an unconstitutional and reckless executive order to abolish the prime education came from the president and his lap dogs the project twenty five agenda to harm our children's future and dismantle the very foundation of equi opportunity in america this is not about improving education or even giving more power to the states i can begin to think of the reason or its practicality but let me give you a breakdown that a partner education ensures that students with disabilities get the support they need that students with low income backgrounds can eat during the day and in the summertime that our schools have the critical safety grants i want to make clear to every single georgian that donald trump the majority in washington and his allies want to tear that all down to punish teachers to erase history and make education a privilege for the wealthy public education is a right not a privilege donald trump and his allies want to hand our schools over to private corporation and extremist ideologies but we will not let them succeed i believe we have responsibility as legislators to defend the right of every child to a quality public education and we were never allowed a failed twice impeached con man to destroy the future of our children so i call on every student every teacher every parent and every american who believes in a promise of a of america and his dream for opportunity for all rise up speak out and organize this is a fight for the soul of our nation if you do not stop this unconstitutional executive order they will come for more our schools our libraries our history and our democracy itself we stop trump once we'll stop them again education is power and we will never let them take that away from us thank you mr you're the well chairman
