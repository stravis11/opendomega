you you you we will begin our day today with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country today is a special day i always look forward to our colleague a colleague representative and doing our devotion and doing our devotion and doing our devotion and doing our devotion and they will make you welcome because I've been and at a great time so without any further ado, I want to introduce to you chaplain who really needs no introduction because he is our colleague representative Mac Jackson of the 128th House District Good morning thank you for that introduction thank you for visiting our church too and I want to invite everyone of you that you can feel welcome to come to Tenel Georgia a small town but great people there you always welcome to come and visit I remember representing Randy Nick said he was called at last minute one time to fill in I was called yesterday representing to fill in and it's an honor to be here for our representative Carol Bennett's presiding elder they had death in the family so we pray for them too but I want to just mention a few things this morning I remember when speaker Ross and brought Reverend Steve Jones here to be the past of the day and he sparked something in me some things I was going through and it just uplifted me I was told that I was told that I was going through 21 and 22 and it says then came Peter to him Jesus and said Lord how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him till seven times Jesus said to him I say not until you until seven times but until 70 times seven you see Peter was trying to find the excuse like most of us to hold on to unforgiveness someone once said that unforgiveness is like drinking poison and hoping the other person dies we find the story we find the story of Joseph in Genesis 37 and as many of you remember Joseph's brothers Joseph had a dream and Joseph brothers hated him because of the dream they sold him for twenty pieces of silver and later he was sold into the house of Potapher but because he held on to his integrity and he would not allow bitterness to enter into his heart so we find in Genesis 39 it says and the Lord was with Joseph and his master saw that the Lord was with him because of his heart what he had in his heart he wouldn't let bitterness enter in he would let unforgiveness enter in and the Lord honored what Joseph did even though he was sold he was hated the Lord stayed with Joseph because he held on to his integrity and through all of Joseph's trials and tribulations and he found that he interprets the dream of Pharaoh he was promoted to the position of ruler over Egypt he was in second command under Pharaoh in Egypt and when his brothers found out that Joseph controlled everything in Egypt they thought that Joseph would hate them so they came to Joseph and Joseph told them something that's very important he says fear not for am I in the place of God you meant evil against me but God turned it into good you see when you hold on to your integrity when you refuse to hate when you refuse to let envy and strife and malice and bitterness enter in God honors that and through the trials through the tribulations and they will come but God will bring you into your destiny if you just hold on to God's unchanging hand so Joseph had to forgive everyone who meant evil against him because Jesus said in Mark 1125 and when you stand praying and that's what we're getting ready to do he said when you stand praying you are all against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses ladies and gentlemen don't drink the poison of unforgiveness hoping the other person dies it will stop you from reaching your destiny because God has a plan for your life can bring that potential into fruition if you hold on to God's unchanging hand shall we pray Heavenly Father we thank you for this day Lord we thank you for your grace and mercy because without your mercy and your grace we would not have woke up this morning so because this is the day that you have made we will rejoice and we will be glad in it Father I choose to forgive beforehand even though trespasses might be done we choose to forgive beforehand in the name of Jesus Lord we thank you for your mercy we thank you for your grace we ask for your wisdom your leading your guardian bless the speak of this house Father let him know Lord God that you are still with him bless our governor bless the lieutenant governor bless this general assembly Father and let them know that the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts and we will be glad to see you in the name of Jesus Lord we thank you we praise you and we honor you in Jesus name Amen would you join me in the pledge a pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic of which is the

I'd like to ask all the real-tore members of the Georgia House of Representatives come down and join me in the well today. And the clerk's ticking. Today we are proud to recognize the Georgia Association of Real Tores that has 50,000 members in the state of Georgia. And also this week starting tomorrow we're going to have days at the dome here. And so there'll be about 700 realtors here so you can be looking for those. There'll be some from your local community. The preamble to the code of ethics of the National Association of Real Tores begins with these words, under all is the land. Ladies and gentlemen, you can't think of anything in American commerce. It doesn't involve real estate. It is residential, commercial, investment, or agricultural. And all of these people and our colleagues work very hard to represent buyers and sellers and landlords and tenants. So we represent our business interest here at the Capitol. But also we are always here to protect private property rights. And so this week when you see my colleagues down here around the Capitol, you greet them because they're all good citizens. They work hard and they're very active politically in your community. Thank you so much, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes Chairman Jasper's for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members on your desk, you have a little card. And what this will do for you. Take your phone, just like you do on the Super Bowl the other night. But this will give you access to the G.DOTs annual summary. They're required legislatively to report back to us what they're doing. This is the beautiful book that they put out, accessed by your phone. When you first open the app, skip the ads, and then you're on it. This takes a lot of work and I've got to meet some of these folks. Alba, McConaughey, Brook Pines, Safara Raymond, Scott Higgley, Katrina Lear. Put this together for us. So take time to look at it. There's some out here on the back. And if you need more, come see me. I'll fix you up. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes Representative Anoloids for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, everyone. Today is Junior League Day at the Capitol. We might see a lot of really motivated, informed, and indefatigable women roaming the halls of the Capitol today. Some of them might be wearing a scarf like this. They are here because they want to talk about their key priorities. They are equity, education, health, and aid and protection, particularly focused on women and children. Again, today is Junior League Day at the Capitol. I hope you will say hello to anyone you see. Don't forget, if you're newer around here, Junior League women have made an immeasurable impact on public policy here in Georgia. They are kind of like EF Hutton, and when they talk, I hope you will listen. Thank you. Chair recognizes Representative Pruitt for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We have a resolution today honoring Middle Georgia State University School of Aviation. We are recognizing February 15 as Aerospace Day at the State Capitol here. Aerospace is our state's largest international exports. We are ranked fifth in the nation with roughly $10 billion annually in exports that represents an economic impact of $68 billion. We have about 800 aerospace companies within the state, over 100,000 high paying jobs, average in around $83,000 each. We produce about $12 billion in direct salaries. We have three major imperative aspects of that aviation training within the state, aviation infrastructure within the state, and creating economic policies that foster and support economic growth. One last thing I want to leave you with is that if you and I wanted to start an airline together and wanted to go buy some jets to do that with, from Airbus or Boeing, we would have to wait 15 years in order to get those jets. The aerospace industry is completely backed up right now, which is a great market to invest in. Thank you. Chair recognizes Representative Hugley for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House. As we continue to celebrate Black History Month, I want to have us pause to remember those who with the slogan, I am a man, workers in Memphis, Tennessee, who sought financial justice in a strike that faithfully became Martin Luther King Jr.'s final cause. On February 12, 1968, 1,300 black sanitation workers in Memphis began a strike to the man better working conditions and higher pay. As part of the civil rights movement, the strike also drew Martin Luther King Jr. and it led to his famous speech where he talked about going to the mountain top. A couple of weeks before the strike, dissatisfaction reached new heights when two men, echo, cold, and Robert Walker, were gruesomely killed while on the job. So today, we pause to remember those who march under the slogan, I am a man. Chair recognizes Representative Jasmine Clark for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Going to the Department of Public Health report that we all get in our emails, all 159 Georgia counties remain at high transmission levels of COVID-19. We're still reporting four to 5,000 cases daily and we've had 129 outbreaks, a majority of them in our K through 12 schools. Our children depend on adults to make good decisions that will protect them. They are at our most vulnerable and at the mercy of the adults to make good sound policy. And that is why I'm concerned that we would allow politics to endanger children. We cannot take an individualistic approach to public health by allowing some to endanger others. It's like allowing a person to poop in the pool and assume that everyone else swimming in it will not be affected. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes Representative Holly for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm joined by my colleague, class of 1975. As I'm class of 1998 and we'd like to wish the thousands of men who call themselves more house men around this nation and the world a happy Founders week. Happy Founders Day. It was yesterday, but certainly you want to recognize for 155 years. This humble school on a red clay hill in Georgia has produced the legendary minds that have shaped movements and have become the kings of industry and in business and the arts and yes, even here in politics. We thank you, more house men who are unashamed, unabashed and undaunted in contrast of the stereotypes that decry that defame the best in our community. It's real quick. Is that like me? Shut up. Before you go to college, you go to high school. I just wanted to add to what was said, the St. Emma Military Academy, which is a all-black military school for young men that was in Virginia. It was on top of a mountain. On the other side of the mountain was a all-girl school, St. Francis and the James River ran between the two of them. The school which I graduated from before I went to more house is now part of this Smithsonian Institute and I wanted you to recognize St. Emma Military Academy. Thank you. We are now going on to the rules calendar. Going on to the rules calendar. Work will read the caption to House Bill 1021. House Bill 1021 by the Rumsden of the 12th and others to be in total and act to amend Code Section 33-283, the fiscal of Georgia, and to relate in the standard non-forfeiture provisions for individual deferred annuities. This bill ever for the Committee on Insurance, that committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes the chairman of the House Insurance Committee, Chairman Lumsden, to present the bill. Good morning, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, I bring...

The U House bill 1021, this is a bill that changes the minimum interest rate from 1% to 1.5% on early termination of insurance based deferred annuity contracts. This is an NAIC model legislation which addresses a nationwide problem with deferred annuity contracts caused by the extreme volatility that's taking place in the five and ten year treasury markets. The five and ten year U.S. treasuries are the underlying investment that makes the deferred annuity possible. The Federal Reserve does not see any improvement in this volatility in the foreseeable future. And with rates dropping on the five and ten year treasuries to less than two tenths of 1%, the deferred annuity products will not be available going forward unless a change has made in this code. NAICI is recognized as a problem and has crafted this model legislation to deal with the issue. And this only applies to the future annuities and does not impact any current contracts. Mr. Speaker, that's the bill and I appreciate your favourable consideration. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is now in the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favourable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is now in the report of the committee. As agreed to, shall this bill now pass all those in favour of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members now voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 1021. The eyes are 153. The nays are two. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1147. House Bill 1147 by Roads of the 120th and others to be entitled to amend Chapter 3 entitled 27th, the official go to George Antiter relating to wildlife generally so as to authorize the hunting and trapping of raccoons in a possum's year round. This bill lemma refer to the committee on game fishing parks that committee recommends it to bill do pass. Chair recognizes the chairman of the committee, chairman Roads to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Representative Williams, why you laughing? Ladies and gentlemen, I have before you this morning House Bill 1147. This is kind of a sister step in some moves that we're making to try to improve our ground nesting wildlife here in our state. Everyone is aware of the sea turtle and the danger has been in but our Bob White Quell and our turkeys, our populations are weighed down. We've taken this year will be the first year we have shortened our turkey season. We've lowered our bag limits and we've limited the one turkey a day so we're taking steps on that side and we think this is a step that we can take to try to help those populations. Florida and Alabama already have gone to no seasons and no limits on raccoons and South Carolina and Tennessee have done similar measures to have year round hunting. Mr. Speaker, that is the bill I'll be glad to take one question. Is this a pro raccoon bill or an anti raccoon bill? That is for each member to decide themselves. That's an excellent answer by the way. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Is that the only question I need to take? No, you have some questions. Okay, I'll take one more. Let's go to Chairman Hogan to your left for a question. So it would be good. You yield? Yes, sir, to my friend. Oh, I didn't know that. I do. Well, today you are anyway. The next bill you have is going to be year round shooting my ducks. I don't know what we're going to work on that. Well, you've already threatened me with killing over and killing my ducks and I've said that that your game warden is going to be attacked by looking you up. Well, you're not supposed to be reporting our private conversations. Mr. Speaker, I ask for your favor consideration. I yield the well. Gentlemen has yielded the well with many, many questions pending. We do have a member that wishes to speak on the bill. Chair recognizes representative Al Williams to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My distinguished chairman and author of this bill has probably just two people left in a state to defend these critters and that's me and the speaker. Some of it's a bum rap. A question was asked yesterday in committee about any good things that they might have done. Now, I admit that it's kind of tough because one is a thief and the other is a liar. Somebody who knows something about them will get that after a while. There are some good points. In Vakula, Florida, there is a monument to the opus. Now I'm a Gologichi and I was about grown before I knew it was an opus. It was just a possum when I was growing up. And for those who know nothing, I know when you don't know anything about raccoons because you call them raccoons. Again, they were coons the whole time I was coming up. And I beg the different with the chairman on a couple of points. One being the sea turtle piece. One a hard for a coon to find his way from Osula, Georgia to the beaches of Georgia. Very smart, but that's a long walk. And I've watched more sea birds eat more sea turtles in 30 minutes than any coon. And if you know a saltwater coon, you'll catch a fiddle of crap. Look at it. Wash it off in the water before he eats it. A chicken will literally eat anything that they can get their beacons. But those of you that are not familiar and I know the Millenniums would know anything about this and some of you won't admit it. But raccoons are quite a delicacy for many many generations. There's folk to eat them with the Indians, but they were taken to a new level of enjoyment with the African American community. Now some of you have never experienced a baked possum and some of you had problems even imagining a baked coon with sweet potatoes around it. Some of you have developed a bourgeois attitude after getting out of your former circumstances. There was a time and it was not a sporting animal but a subsistence animal. And I want you to know that my grandmother was one of the finest cookers of the raccoon in America. So I developed a taste for it. At first I used to tell folk there was an honor of my grandmother but the truth is I just liked the taste and I'm pretty good at cooking them too. Now I've said all that to say this. These are fine animals with few friends. They do eat a few turkey eggs but a lot of animals do too. They're good. Over in Alabama I remember there was a possum farm I saw was working on a job over there in this guy owned a farm where he grew possums that got up to 12 pounds. Why don't you tell your possums a lie? Because if you endanger him he'll lay down and play dead. Just stick his feet up in the air. You brought him with a stick and he just can't get you dead early. Why is the coon abandoned because he's born with a band on his eyes. It makes him look like some of you look this morning, no pun intended. Now folk in all reality, insincereity. I'm supporting this bill because the chairman begs so unmercifully and it has his good points and I'm going to vote for it. I certainly hope you do too. And whatever you do, if you fall off your pedestal and need a meal, I'll fix your coon. Thank you miss speaker. Almost lunchtime. Everybody's getting hungry after that. Okay, that's all the speakers. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here's none. The report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. The purpose does representative Bentley rise. Hall of Minerary Inquiry. State your inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that the chairman or the other representative acknowledged me? I would have asked the question of how is hunting raccoons year-round will affect the funeral home industry? Is that not true, Mr. Speaker? I know that is true. Unquestionably true. The purpose is chairman England rise. Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Is it not true that the gentleman was speaking as putting sweep potatoes in with a coon or the pass of me the one? Is it not true that when you do that after it comes out of the oven you throw the pass and you're the coon out and eat the sweep potatoes? You need to have a conversation with him offline over here about that. All right. We'll do one more parliamentary inquiry for what purpose does representative Hutchinson rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Is it not true that I'm wondering if this passes can I execute the thieves in my garage without a permit? Well, you got the expert up here on all things wildlife and closely related. Okay. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 1147. The eyes are 141. The nays are 17. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed.

Chair recognizes Chairman Gerald Green to present the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Also a legislative council, but mainly I want to thank the House Committee on State Properties.

Is it not true that we deeply appreciate all the hard work of the Chairman and the committee in taking care of these needed transactions? Well, thank you for that question. And you were certainly instrumental in helping us work through a very wanting Glen County, and we really appreciated your assistance there. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, there's no more. Do you do have one more if you care to yield? Yes, sir. Chair recognizes Representative Jasmine Clark to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman yield? I do. I'm looking at the sponsors of this bill, and I notice that there's a property in DeCab County that is listed in the bill, but there are no sponsors from DeCab County. Do the people in DeCab County also know that this bill will affect their county? Yes, if you were listening to me just a few moments, those individuals that are affected by the resolution were contacted into the Cab County. Does the gentleman further yield? Yes. Do you mind telling me who those individuals are because I just spoke to the leadership of the delegation? I'm sorry, I couldn't understand you. Could you tell me who those individuals are because it's my understanding that the individuals in the delegation weren't? It's the one in the district, in the area that is affected. Thank you. You're welcome. Mr. Speaker, yield the well and ask for your consideration for House Resolution 664. Yes, not yet. I'll move the objection to the previous question being ordered. The chair here is done. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution?

I do not know if that's in your district or not representative, to be honest with you. All purpose is representative Moore rise. Good morning. Is it not true that I too represent that particular area and I have not been spoken with? I am right there at Penoly Road in Rock Springs. Well, you heard the chairman talk about the notice that was given. So I'm not sure why you didn't get information about that. And I have not. All right. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Resolution 664. The eyes are 140. The nays are 18.

And Thomas Candace, to deliver this resolution I've been referred to the Committee on State Properties that committee recommends that this resolution be adopted. Chair recognizes Chairman Green to present the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Before I do this House Resolution 6683, for those that have some concerns about the previous resolution.

Ladies and gentlemen, last session in Senate Bill 6, in an effort to continue to watch tax payers funding, this section was sunset for June 30th of this year. This is a calendar year exemption and we need to align that date to a calendar year. So this bill simply on line 60 moves to the June 30th sunset to December 31st and it extends it for the minimum amount of time it can to still allow the exemption to function properly in a calendar year. Mr. Speaker, that's all the bill does. It's a House for their favorable support so we can align this exemption with the calendar year. I'll answer any questions. Do not appear to have questions.

This bill then referred to the Committee on Judiciary. That committee recommends the disbilled do pass by Committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Rich to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I bring to you House Bill 1275. This is a bill that was requested by the Council of Municipal Court Judges. That was negotiated with GMA. They are supportive of this bill. Municipalities typically contract with individuals to serve as municipal court judges. To better ensure that the judges remain as neutral and impartial as possible. In 2016, the municipal court judges and municipalities agreed that municipalities could terminate these judges for cause only and that these judges would be entitled to do process in that decision to terminate, meaning they needed to be provided with cause and a hearing and steps to ensure that the termination is valid. This bill simply updates our code to include the steps in the termination process and also clarifies that municipal court judges are required to be contracted for at least one year and that municipalities can appoint an individual to serve the unexpired term of a municipal court judge who cannot continue to serve out his term. That is in essence the bill. And Mr. Speaker, I will yield for any questions. You do not have any questions. Thank you. I request your favorable consideration. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute?

This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. What purpose does Representative Gamble rise? Make a motion. State your motion. I move that House Bill 1059 be recommitted to the rules committee. If Gamble has moved that House Bill 1059, which is on the rules calendar, they be recommitted to the rules committee. Mr. Clerk, would you read the caption? House Bill 1059, the 15th and others to be titled an act to avenge House 24, Title 33, the fish go to Georgia and it's generally to ensure and generally so as to provide for exclusions to unfair trade practices and unlawful inducements.

This bill then referred to the committee a natural resources environment that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Nicks to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, the House, this bill is probably one of the simplest ones you'll see this year. It just changed one date. The hazardous waste management fees and hazardous substance reporting fees are scheduled to sunset on July the 1st of this year, 2022. This bill would extend those to 2027, a five-year extension. The fees raised somewhere between $1 and $2 million a year that EPD uses to monitor and clean up hazardous waste. And I would ask your favor of consideration for House Bill 893. Mr. Speaker, I will yield if there are no questions. You have a question, one question. Do you? I will yield, yes, sir. Chair recognizes the minority caucus who have representative Wilkerson who is here left for a question. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, sir. Does this, is there going to be another bill that actually dedicates fees or has he deal with the dedication of fees? I understand that they're working on that bill now. There was some question and natural resources about that. That is something that Ways and Means should really take up rather than us. All we're doing is extending the fee here. Mr. Speaker, with that, I will yield the well and ask for a favorable consideration on House Bill 893. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute that the chair here is none? The committee substitute is adopted.

The eyes are 1 and this bill having received that requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1044. House Bill 1044 by a rep. Senator Perkwell, 155th and others being titled an act to amend the chapter 62, Title 36, the official to George Antony relating to development authorities. It's supposed to provide for the creation of regional development authorities. This bill having referred to the committee on economic development and tourism. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by rules committee substitute. The chair recognizes representative Perkwell to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The first meeting of the House Rule Development Council, we were introduced to a highly successful regional collaborative with four counties, those of being Morgan, Jasper, Newton, and Walton. They formed an intergovernmental agreement that provided for the sharing of expenses and equally important the sharing of the Anglo-MTACs revenues on a piece of 1500 acre parcel that they jointly owned. None of the counties could individually undertake such an ambitious plan, but together they found a regional effort could work, and it did. It was very, very successful. This mutually beneficial framework that we saw with these four counties is something that we on the rule of development council wanted to see replicated and other parts across the state. Hence, House Bill 1044. It incentivizes and not just preaches. So, economic developers often will preach regionalism. What is good for Lounds County is also good for Eccles County and Thomas County, but we often don't act that way. And this provides an incentive or a carrot to not just preach regionalism, but to act that way. The carrot comes in Section H of the bill, which allows for the quality jobs tax credit of the lowest tier county in the regional authority and is specific to the property which is jointly owned. It's a fairly simple bill, and I ask for your favourable consideration on the Rules Committee's Substitute of House Bill 1044. You did not appear to have any questions. Thank you. I'm sorry. I know you have a question. Do you yield? Yes, sir. I yield for one and no others want to speak on this bill. Chair recognizes representative Meeks. Do you write for a question? Thank you. Does Ditto menu? Yes, sir. I will yield for a question. We all know that the governor has been advocating for projects of regional significance. Will this not be another tool in the toolbox for those projects and particularly in rural Georgia? Well, thank you for the question. It absolutely is another tool. One more tool. It's not the end-all bill. It is one more tool that we can add to shine this right-light economic freedom across the state. I will yield now, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes Chairman Oliver to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I support 1044 and I will be happy to vote for it. I have spent a considerable amount of time in the last two years asking questions about development authorities. And I urge you to consider asking these questions to and your local communities. 1044 moves forward to assert some rules, some God rules on how development authorities, regional development authorities act. But I will tell you that we don't know how many development authorities there are in Georgia. Probably over 600. They're over 20 in DeCab County. And we have no idea about how much bond debt they have issued or who the recipients are. As a matter of law, as a member of the General Assembly or as a taxpayer in DeCab in the state of Georgia, I'm not entitled to know what the deal is that a development authority may have negotiated with a developer. Unless I'm the recipient of a legal notice in the newspaper that a bond validation hearing is going to happen in Superior Court. And then I don't have standing to object only the county does. The school board doesn't have an opportunity to object the city's don't. And in my fast developing county, there's an awful lot of conflict and litigation over competing development authorities. We're competing at a very high level, privately, in secret, and successfully. This is a tool that developers and economic development providers use successfully. It's a valid tool. It's something that enhances our opportunities economically. But I ask you to consider, please, what are the issues of transparency? What are the issues of participation in knowing the benefits or benefiting from the benefits? And I ask you to consider us have further discussion on this. I have several bills that are pending. We've had some successful hearings thus far. And I'm looking forward to more engagement and more discussion. How many development authorities are there in Georgia? How much debt have they issued? And how much tax abatements have they granted? Consider asking those questions at home. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to withdrawing the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is withdrawn. Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules? The chair here is none. The rules committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee? Which was favorable to the passage of the bill. The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye? Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does Representative McLaren rise? Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, if I were just a simple, friendly economic development bill, and I already had a floor letter from the Georgia Chamber, but I was trying to upgrade to a scorecard vote, do you think it would help to just throw in some new prosecutors and cops? I don't really think you're wanting an answer from that one. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines. On the passage of House Bill 1044, the eyes are 165, the nasors zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 969. House Bill 969, my reps and I have smith of the 18th and others to be entitled to amend. Chapter 13 and title 33, the fiscal to Georgia and Tate relayed an insurance holding company systems, so to update the regulation of insurance company holding systems for direction from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. This bill have referred to the committee on insurance. That committee recommends a disbile do pass. Chair recognizes Representative Tyler Paul Smith to present the bill. Thank you, Miss Speaker. Good morning. I bring to you today House Bill 969. This is the insurance department bill. To give you a little background, this concerns the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The NAIC is created and governed by insurance commissioners and all 50 states, District of Columbia and five U.S. territories. Insurance is essentially a state regulated industry and it's our preference to keep it that way as we're familiar with the needs of the citizens of the state. Georgia receives its accreditation from the NAIC. The NAIC develops model laws as an organization in each individual state passing them through its own legislature. Sometimes accreditation is dependent on one of these laws. Revision to this in 2020 the NAIC updated its insurance holding company system model act in response to the 2008 great recession. There are a number of very technical changes overall though it provides states with more information on an insurance group's financial profile and available capital. It essentially forces insurance holding companies to be more transparent with their finances to better allow our offices, their office to assist the risk to the industry. And avoid future financial disasters. Passing this model act this year is necessary for Georgia to maintain its NAIC accreditation. This will allow for the department insurance to allow domestic insurers based in Georgia to avoid being potentially subject additional requirements imposed by other states where they do business or by the federal government. Ms. Speaker that is an essence the bill and if there are no questions I'll yield well. There are no questions. Thank you, Ms. Speaker. I ask favorable consideration. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee has agreed to.

If so the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 969. The eyes are 163. The nails are zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed.

They will all be assigned to the Intergovernmental Coordination Committee. Is there any objection? Is there any objection Chair, here's none and it is so ordered.
