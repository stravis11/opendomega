time for religious studies off school premises and it falls in line with the 1952 Supreme

House Bill 101 is the third from the bottom
on the first page, House Bill 101.
And basically, this is a bipartisan transparency bill
that mandates all health insurance companies
and promising benefit managers of Georgia
report to the state of Georgia their findings.
So the state health care benefit plan
public school teachers health care plan and the public school employment
health plan. They say they take all our rebates and we don't know our premiums
keep going up and we just want them to account for the money that they say
we're saving on our rebates. That's about it. Okay don't see any questions
thanks sir. Thank you sir. This is House Bill 285 it reported out of GD
non-civil this morning, and what this bill does is provides a procedure for people who
are involuntarily committed to the hospital to be removed from the criminal background
checklist rather than a computer purging.
It would be a process.
Okay.
No questions.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay.
Okay, I'm going to call on the administration to speak to the rule substitute for House
Bill 521.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
So I present to you a proposed rule substitute, the HB521.
This was originally Chairman Anderson's bill and the language from Chairman Anderson's
bill remains in this legislation with respect to the annexation. There is a section that is added
in section 2 which would apply to Pauline County which includes the language captured in B which
would require any annexation that is to occur. Be by consent of the county and the city would
only apply to Pauling County, but ask for your favorable consideration.
And this comes with the support of Chairman Gullet.
Okay.
You've heard the explanation of entertain a motion, second motion, and second that do pass
any opposition.
