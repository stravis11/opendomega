loaded. If so, the clerk will lock the machines. Doorkeepers will please close the doors and keep them closed. We will begin our day-to-day with Scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the lady from the 73rd House District Chairman Karen Matthew Eck. Chairman Matthew Eck. Good morning, Mr. Speaker. And thank you. Good morning colleagues. It's my distinct pleasure to introduce not only a pastor of mine but a great friend. Ricky Shepherd was born and raised in Griffin, Georgia. Go Bears, right? And in light of what we heard yesterday with the Mental Health Parity Act, it's so fitting to have Pastor Shepherd here today. As a young teenager, young adult, Ricky became an alcoholic and battled it for many years until the age of 28. When he gave his life to Christ and began a new life that didn't involve alcohol. The past 18 years, Ricky has been involved in a full-time ministry and spends his days encouraging and helping people who are battling with addictions or just in need of help. Ricky has served on multiple school boards, including Monroe Academy and Rock Springs Christian Academy. He currently does leadership training for local churches and businesses as well as motivational speaking. Ricky is currently serving as executive pastor of Christ Chapel Community Church in Zebulin, Georgia and is the vice chairman for the Pike County Chamber of Commerce. Representative Kim. Ricky is proud to be the son of Harold and Phyllis Shepherd of Griffin, Georgia. And his dad, Harold, is 96 years old, a World War II veteran and still drives. But he's asking us to be real careful around breakfast and dinner on any given day. He has one teenage daughter, Riley, who is currently a ninth grade online Liberty University student. And his favorite saying is, love people where they are and don't leave them where you found them. Pastor Ricky. Thank you, Speaker Roslin and Representative Matthew Act for me being here today. I'm honored to be here today. It is an honor to come and to speak with you. I first of all, I want to say thank you to all of you for your service to our great state. It's a years ago I was actually approached. I love politics. And years ago I was actually approached by some people to want me to run for office. I told them I said, you know, I said, there's enough true stuff about me that I don't want my daughter to know. Let alone have folks make stuff up about me. So I kindly passed, but I appreciated I want to talk to you today about just having a great day. It's going to be a great day. I got out of bed at six o'clock this morning when my feet hit the floor headed to the gym and I said, it's going to be a great day. The scripture says in Psalms 1824 says, today is the day that the Lord has made. I will rejoice and be glad in it. And I believe there's four things that we can do today and every day to ensure that we're going to have a great day. The first thing we can do is just look. Start each day looking for the good in people. It seems that we live in a day now where we're so busy trying to find things in people or things in circumstances that divide us rather than unites us. I was raised and with my parents, they taught us that if you go looking for trouble, you'll find it. I believe the opposite is true as well. If you'll go looking for good, you'll find it. Take time each day just to get up and just look. Look for the good in people. Even in the worst of us, there's always something good that can be found in us. So not only should we look, the second thing is just listen. Helen Keller once said that the only thing worse than not having sight is to have sight with no vision. And to put a different spin on that, I'd say the only thing worse than having ears to hear is to listen without hearing. See, one thing that I know for sure is that everyone just wants someone to listen to them. It reminds me of a story of an elderly man in the nursing home and it was his birthday and the nurse come in to check on him and she said, happy birthday and he jumped up out of bed. He said, can you guess how old I am? And she looked at him. She said, I'm button your shirt. So he unbuttoned shirt and she just kept looking. She said, take your shirt off. So he took his shirt off and he kept looking and she said, take your t-shirt off. So he took his t-shirt off and then she looked at him again. She said, flex your muscles. He sat there and he flexed. She said, you're 88 years old. He said, how did you know that? She said, you told me yesterday. We need to listen. Larry King, the late CNN anchor, he once said, I've never learned anything while I was talking. We all need to listen. One thing I know for sure, it doesn't matter what race, it doesn't matter if you're rich, poor, Republican, Democrat, independent, that matter if you're born on the right side of the tracks or the wrong side of the tracks, we're all the same in this sense. We all want to know that someone is listening. If we've passed a good bill or we had a good day or we've had a bad day, we just want to know that someone is listening. See one thing I know about people, people don't know how they don't they don't care how much you know until they know how much you care. People just want someone to listen to them. So wake up every day and look. Wake up every day and listen. Wake up every day and learn. Just learn. See it's amazing how much we can learn if we'll just listen and if we'll just look. Every day that God blesses us is another opportunity for us to learn from something. One thing I've learned in my 18 years of being in full-time ministry is that even in the roughest criticism, in the roughest critics that I've had in my life, I've always found some little small nugget of truth or some little small nugget of something that I can learn from, even in the worst criticisms that I've had. Sometimes lack of humility keeps us from learning. You know, after all it's kind of hard to learn something when you know everything, right? How many of you know somebody that knows everything? How many of us that person sitting to the left or right? No, don't raise your hand on that. Don't do that. Like a humility keeps us from learning. Fear will keep us from learning. The fear of failure, the fear of making a mistake will keep us from learning. But you know one thing I would rather try and fail versus failing to try. It's okay to make a mistake. It's okay to fail. We learn from our mistakes. We learn from our failures. It's wise to learn from our mistakes, but it's wise or, if that's the word, to learn from the mistakes of others. So we need to look. We need to listen. We need to learn. And the last thing we need to do is we just need to laugh. We just need to laugh. Proverbs 17, 22 says this. It says laughter does the heart good like a medicine. I was raised with four brothers, just five of us boys and all. And as we've already heard, my dad's 96 years old, World War II veteran, I would highly advise you to stay off the streets of Griffin. He drives every day during breakfast time and dinner time. Just stay away from there. But I was raised. My mom used to teach us and taught us that through the Lord and laughter, you can get through anything. With the Lord and laughter, you can get through anything. This past year and a half for us has been the toughest year and a half that I've ever walked in my 51 years on this earth. My mom is in the last stages of dementia. And it's not real funny when you walk in her room and she don't even recognize you. It's kind of hard to smile when you're singing songs with her and she don't even, my mom was a singer. She traveled all over the country singing gospel songs, Southern gospel. And when you sing some of the old songs of the church and she can't even find the right note, it's kind of hard to smile during those times. But one thing that I've noticed is that even though she may not even realize what she's doing, even now she's finding ways to make us laugh. A great example of that is about three or four weeks ago, I got a phone call from her nurse. And she said, Mr. Shepherd, she said, I just want to update you with your mom. She says, she was having a bad day today. And I went to her room to try to calm her down. She was real emotional. And she said, Mr. Shepherd, she said, what's wrong? I keep in mind my dad's 96 years old. She said, well, she said, I'd be okay if at husband of mine would learn to just keep his bridges on. They've been married 56 years. He's 96 years. I mean, the first thing I want to do is find my dad to give him a fist pump. I'm like, you go dad 96 years old. You just have to laugh. It's okay to laugh. There's something that we can find humor in in everything. And in closing, everything that I've told you today, you may think, well, wait a minute, this has nothing to do with me. You said, what can I do for me to have a good day? Everything that you said is something that I do for others. That's exactly right. Your servants. I'm a servant. When we accepted that role, it didn't become about me anymore, it became about them. Zig Zigler, great speaker. He said this. He said, it was amazing that the day that I set out to live every day, making other people's dreams come true. He said, it was amazing that all of my dreams became true. So today, if you want to have a great day, learn to look, listen, learn, laugh, and do everything you can to make other people's dreams come true. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, I come to you today, thankful for you this day that the day that you have made. I thank you for each man in warmest sitting in this room, and I thank you for their service to our great state. And God, I ask you today to give wisdom and direction to each one of them as they govern this state and communities. I ask you God to protect our families, our children, and our grandchildren as we travel so many unknowns in this day that in this day-to-day walk. And God, I ask you to forgive us where we fell you, and God to heal our land, and heal our great nation, and our great and beautiful state. Thank you for all that you do, all that you have done, and for all that you're going to do. I pray this prayer today, Lord, respecting all faiths, but today I pray this prayer in the mighty name of your Son Jesus, the name of all names. Amen. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

This 18-year-old is the beloved son of Shamein and Denise Sparrow. Tyler was in the early county, Haskell reached scholar program. Now watch him from the grade, the eighth grade, to John the Reach program there. Taken too soon, Tyler was cherished by his peers for his strength and generous heart. And no matter what was asked of him, he carried himself with grace and humility. I ask that we stop a moment and reflect upon the family and the memory of Tyler. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Chair recognizes Representative Mack Jackson for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I ask Representative Brian Prince to join me this morning we come with a heavy heart. On yesterday we lost a good man in Jefferson County. Commissioner Tommy Neu served on the Board of Commissioners for over 42 years. He was a true friend and mentor. He always gave me good advice. When the words of James Taylor, I've seen fire and I've seen rain. I've seen sunny days when I could not find a friend but I always thought that I would see you again. So long my friend, would you join us in a moment of silence? Thank you, Mr. Speaker, we yield the well. The chair recognizes the minority leader of this house, leader Beverly for a morning order. Members of the gentleman, your respect and attention while he's in the well. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. At the beginning of this President's Day weekend, I am reminded of President Abraham Lincoln. Not necessarily my favorite president but he had some tremendous sayings that I think are worth repeating today given the current state of affairs in the General Assembly. To the people of this state, Mr. Speaker and colleagues, the leading principal, the chair anchor of American republicanism, has not been honored in this body. Therefore the result is wrong. This quote that Abraham Lincoln said is, stand with anybody that stands right. Stand with him while he is right and part with him when he is wrong. The process in which local redistricting has been handled under this gold dome is wrong. Mr. Speaker has been no less than what we can easily be termed as a hostile takeover by the majority party. And the Georgia House Democratic Party will not stand full with anyone because this is wrong. Second quote, no man is good enough to govern another man without the others consent. I say this is a leading principal, the chair anchor of American republicanism. Mr. Speaker, the Georgia House Democratic Party does not consent to this hostile takeover. We are each elected by the people of this great state to represent their interest in their districts, not mine, not yours, but the people of Georgia and their districts. So I feel compelled this morning responsible, this morning simply remind those of you and the majority party that continuously seek to justify wrong by using carve outs and exceptions, by changing the rules during the game by moving the goal post because you see that you are losing the game by wielding your political power to remind us in a minority party that your power politics supersedes principle, that your power politics supersedes the will of the people because you say so. The chair, anger, and frustration that we feel as a result of you not playing by the role is as true and as honest as any human being would feel given the expectation of fairness by receiving the whole, the whole hard truth of indifference. Third quote, I'll leave you with this morning, Mr. Speaker. We ask for just the same thing, fairness and fairness only. Mr. Speaker, you can determine that so far as within your power, you, I and all others will have one thing as we go through this general assembly, fairness. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield a well. Chair recognizes Chairman Stevens for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I rise today to recognize our World Champion, 2021 World Champion, Atlanta Braves. You know, today, normally, Major League Baseball Pitchers and Catchers would be reporting to Arizona and Florida to start spring training. They are not. They are not because Commissioner Maniford suggested a lockout in December and has stopped America's pastime. He has failed the fans of Arizona and Florida, the economies of Arizona and Florida, like he failed Georgia last year when he moved the All Star game. Commissioner, you can do better. You can do better. Coming back our national pastime, make good decisions so the fans of the game, America's pastime can enjoy that once again in 2022. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, you'll the well. Chair recognizes Representative McClain for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And I just want folks to know one thing before I do my moment in Black History. The players cannot, the players can only strike. The owners are the only one that can lock people out. The owners are the ones who will lock baseball out. No players, no union. So Mr. Speaker, I want to make sure that this body knows that players cannot, they only can strike. Players can only strike. Okay, I want to get it, man. But I want to go. My moment in Black History, me here at Spreachley is that I would not talk about the bombing in Tulsa, Oklahoma, known as Black Wall Street in May. I would not talk about what happened on April 4, 1968 in Memphis, South St. Dr. King. But I will talk about more so is me coming as a 22-year-young man. And I like to say that when you come here as a 22-year-young man, the people you meet, Reverend Jose of Williams taught us he was unbalt and unbalt. You also had, you know, Joe Larrie, who always said if he yelled, you must be mellow. If you're brown, you hang around. If you're red, you're dead, man. If you're white, you're right. And you're black, you get back. But then it was always his wife. Mrs. Evelyn Larrie, Gibson, my home girl, who always said one thing. She says, if you stay ready, you don't have to get ready. She taught me that. And then I want to thank Representative Huggley and Representative Bowdie for talking about I am a man and also doing something on Reverend James Orange who brought me into the movement in 1978 because he called everybody leader. He always thought that everybody could lead. And one of the things that I always thought about Congressman John Lewis, good trouble. He taught us good trouble. I never knew what that meant, but it was good trouble. And then his Reverend Jesse Jackson, where he always told me to keep and hope alive. And I didn't understand that at all. I'm a speaker. I want to, I'm going to year the well with Reverend Abel Love, told us. And when Robert Abel Love says, please, if we work together, it really works. Working together works. Working together always works. And so those people have made me who I am today. And I want to say to you all is this, that has brought me to right as right and wrong as wrong. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I year the well. Chair recognizes representative Derek Jackson for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 115 years ago, seven young men in Ithaca, New York, Cornell University, formed the very first black Greek lettered organization, Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, incorporated in which I'm a member of. Today, Mr. Speaker and ladies of gentlemen, is our 15th annual Alpha Day at the Capitol, where we get an opportunity to engage our legislators, because we continue to live by mentally deez, scholarship, and the love for mankind. I year the well. Chair recognizes representative McLeod for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, colleagues, and good morning. It's the real McCoy. Have you ever wondered what that scene, where that scene came from? Well, they're referring to Mr. Elijah McCoy, born in 1844 in Ontario, Canada. The parents, his parents escaped from slavery and can tuck it via the underground railroad. He was educated in Scotland in the field of engineering. Upon returning to the United States, he faced discrimination because he was black. He couldn't get a job in engineering because his white managers didn't think a black man could be an engineer. So they would put him to work in the boiler room. That's where he invented the automatic oil and device for moving parts and steam locomotives known as the oil drip cup in 1872. He has 60 patents for his lubrication devices because his inventions were so superior, all up to all others, people often describe anything that was really good as the real McCoy. So have you enjoyed a peanut butter sandwich today? You can thank Mr. Carver for inventing 300 ways to use peanut butter. Who is Madam CJ Walker? Well, she is the first self-made woman millionaire. Ladies, cosmetics and hair care was her claim to fame. Stop the traffic signal. That's Garrett Morgan. Garrett Morgan and the gas mass, 1944, 1914. I could go on all day telling you about these awesome inventions. But I will stop here. Let me just big up all the black scientists, engineers and inventors because my black is beautiful. 24-7, 365 days. I yield the well. Your recognizes Chairman Ballinger for a morning order. Hey, y'all. I don't come to the well very much. I think this is actually my first morning order. Maybe I did the Girl Scouts once, but that was a ballot. But I just, you know, something just rise to the level of needing a comment. And our minority leader, I felt like his comments were incendiary and I think they were uncalled for and I think above all, they were unfair. It's one thing to preach. It's another walk to walk. So, you know, before we get into, he did this, she said this, all of that. I think we need to look within ourselves and see how we're doing and what we're doing to cross it, to make it better and to make it more fair. For everybody in this house, everybody in this house wants the best Georgia can be and I truly believe that. Everybody wants the very best state and everybody works towards that. We need to all work and it takes all of us pulling together. And I do hope that we'll be able to do that with the true sense of fairness. Thank you, Miss Speaker. I yield the well. Chair recognizes representative Hutchinson for a morning order. Good morning, colleagues. Today I bring to you six-year-old Sean. Sean is a sensitive, loving and caring boy who enjoys watching Mickey Mouse, the word party, playing his tablet and with monster trucks and matching objects. We have hundreds of children that are available for adoption in Georgia. The most difficult children to play, so those with special needs. So I encourage you to look into children who are available for adoption, older children and children with special needs. Thank you, Miss Speaker. I yield the well. Chair recognizes Chairman Powell for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Welcome to the floor this morning to notify folks. A lot of you all have asked me about a repair bill to the cannabis medical cannabis situation we have. Three years ago, for those of you who were here, this house overwhelmingly passed the process to produce medical cannabis to those children and sick people in Georgia that sciences proved that cannabis oil is a benefit to. Three years later, it still hasn't happened. We had some hearings back in November during a special session and we analyzed some major problems. The problems that exist, quite frankly, is because of a problem they had in the evaluation process. And we have been working on it and it's not perfect, but it does fix the problem so that they can get on issuing licenses to get medical cannabis to the sick and the deserving folks in state of Georgia. I bring this to your attention. I've had this. There's been a lot of people that signed this and I'm going to lay it over on the side over here so anyone who wishes to sign is available before we drop it in. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Let's take that back to your desk to keep down congestion up here. It'll be on my desk. Chair recognizes Chairman Watson for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'll be brief. Today is one of my favorite days of the year. It's National Cabbage Day. Georgia produces over 30,000 acres of cabbage and most of those are grown in my district. And so appreciate Mr. Speaker. Thank you. And I want to ask members to please come to order. Have a special morning order. Please take your seats. Chair recognizes the Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Chairman England, for a special morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, everybody. Ladies and gentlemen, I've always had a plan. Just never really planned how to do this. Today I'm announcing I will not be seeking reelection for another term. You know, with age comes wisdom too and as a young man I always had a plan and I had a plan to be here one day. I'm very concerned and I feel like the Lord has told me now it's time to move on. 18 years in this body has been some of the most meaningful work in my entire life. I never dreamed that I would be here this long and have the opportunity to work with you to get to know you, to solve issues in this great state. You know I was fifth grader was the first time I ever come up here and it was a fifth grade field trip from Little Old County Line Elementary School. Being smiling I did the math this morning. You were in your second year of your first term when we were here. I got to thinking about that last night I said I need to go back and see his swearing in date and did the math and I'm like wow that's incredible. My hat's off to you sir. I know how hard it's been on me and my family and I just have an idea of how hard it's been on you and your family. And so many others of you in here, Chairman Parish, Chairman Green, so many others. I don't want to start naming names because I leave them out. But each and every one of you, whether you've been here for a year, six months, two years, ten years, twenty years. It takes a concerted effort of not only yourself but those back home that have faith in you and it's not just your family. It's those that love you and your community. It's those that love me and my community. Like Miss Beth Caldwell, who was the person that called me the morning that qualifying opened up for a vacant seat and said Terry now is your time. We lost her a couple of years ago. But she never failed to tell me. It's bad of health that she got into. She never failed to tell me every time I saw her how proud she was of me. I was proud of her. She'd been a leader in our community and someone that I treasure. I loved her. Now I've had opportunity to serve under two speakers and three different governors. And it's been a wild ride a lot of times. Many of you in here have served under many of the same people. But there's one thing I never doubted about those five individuals. And it was their love for this state and the love for the people that live here. Each and everyone had had their own way of going about showing that love. But there was no doubt in my mind that they love this state. There's no doubt in my mind that all 180 of us love this state and our people. Now we fight, we argue. We get mad at one another. But I've yet to have a meeting in my office or anywhere else in this building. In 18 years that someone was trying to do spiked to someone else because of anger. They might have been other meetings where that was going on, but I never was part of one of those. But it's always been a heated discussion or not always been heated discussion, but it's always been discussions of what is best. And how do we best serve these individuals that call Georgia home, that we call our constituents? The ones that send us down here to do this job. You know, 12 years is an appropriations chairman. It's an awful long time. And quite honestly, it takes about the first five or six to even know what you're doing. But the one great thing about that job and the hours it takes to do that job is the greatness that I get to see that we get to see in the state. And the state employees that are out there working every day from the defects worker on the coast to the state trooper and the mountains to the Department of Ag employee and deep Southwest Georgia checking on cabbages. But they love this state as well. They're very seldom lauded. And that's why you'll find me a lot of times when I get up here, call attention to them because they're out there every day. Just like we come here every day, their own their jobs every day as well. I had some incredible role models during this tenure and three in particular that I want to mention right now that are no longer with us. Johnny Metis, Jay Powell and Jack Hill. Johnny was in the class of 2005 with me and several others, majority leader and a few others in this room. And in many ways Johnny was our daddy. He was our big brother. He was our crazy little brother sometimes. He was a mentor. He could be a little sideways. I just want to make him a good rules chairman and they're right, then. You got to be a little sideways sometimes in that job. Jay was one of the most intelligent people I've ever had the chance in my life to work with. Jay would dive into topics and understand them better than I could ever fathom to understand. And then my buddy Jack. And many ways was my big brother.

Anyways, he was a father figure as well. And as someone that said yesterday, Jack was one of those people that had a big heart. He taught me a lot about having a big heart. As the gentleman sets in this chamber as well, that has had to put up with me in an apartment here in Atlanta for a cumulative total of a little over four years represented Benton. Tommy has been one of those. We get back to the apartment a lot of nights, eat the can of soup and just have some of the most wonderful discussions about history. Not just Georgia history, not just Jackson or Barrett County history, but about American history and the things that have happened and the great individuals of all walks of life that have had such a stamp on our state and on our country. Tommy thanks for putting up with me going to bed early a lot of night. He just saved me pretty hard about I was going to turn into a pumpkin when I walked to the bedroom at about 715. But when you get here, now or I get here and some others get here, you got to go to bed early. Our friends across the building in the Senate. I know we pick on each other and we say some crude things, some time about one another. But you know, there's 56 individuals over there that I count as my friends as well. And ones that I've worked with for many years on many different issues. And you know, one that kind of came into my life a couple years ago, and that's Chairman Blake Tillery. Blake and I have had the pleasure of working together. He may say it wasn't a pleasure working with me, but it was certainly a pleasure working with him over the last two years. He had big shoes to fill. He won't fill Jack's shoes, but he's going to size some out of his own. Incredible, you know, man. I've already talked a little bit about our state employees that covered the state and all of them. But you know, each person I've heard do one of these speeches has always made a point and I will to thank the staff here at the Capitol. From the clerk's office to everybody that the our doorkeepers, our messengers, all those folks that always have a smile on their face, they're always the ones making sure that whatever it is, what hair-brained idea we might have, they worked to help us see through either that it was hair-brained idea or that it had merit. Legislative Council bless their hearts. I can't imagine what they go through during session and they doing an incredible job. But the one staff that I'm most proud of that have done things for me that I could have never done for myself and prepared me in ways that I could never prepare myself as well. And that's our House Budget and Research Office. Martha and Christine are hiding over in the windowsill. The young people that we have working there are some of the most incredible in this country. And I say that because I can back it up. Their colleagues from around the country that do the same job they do on a yearly basis for us have recognized many of those in our office as being the best in the country. You know, ain't bragging when you can back it up. Come on, brag on them a little bit, but I can back it up too. Martha and Christine quite often are referred to as my count of wives. Quite honestly during session for the three months we're in session generally, I see a lot more of them than I do of Cindy. And they stay only about as much as Cindy does too. But they're two incredible people. And I'd be remiss if I didn't shout out to John Brown. John was the director of the office when I became chairman of the committee. And John was a very patient soul. It is a very patient soul. And John helped me immensely of trying to grow into the role. My friends in Barrett County, those folks that have voted to send me down here all these times. Many of them shaking their heads thinking, oh Lord, can't figure out what he'll mess up this time. But you know, they've had a faith in me that many times I didn't have it myself. Our speaker. I mentioned the fifth grader a while ago. This grader's dream about a lot of things. I dreamed about being an astronaut, being a firefighter, being an architect, doing all kinds of things. But also this was always in the back of my mind. And in those dreams that you get carried away with sometimes you dream, you know, if the speaker would just know my name, that would be cool. If the governor would just know my name, that would be cool. I mentioned a while ago, two speakers and three governors. I've been blessed. I got to know them. They knew my name. I count them friends. But I current speaker, I count my brother. We've been down some tough roads. We've been down some good roads. We've been on the mountain top. We've been in the valley. You know, it gets a little tangled up, but Nietzsche once said out of chaos comes order. And our house was in chaos at one point. There was one man that had the ability. I felt had the ability actually a year before we actually had the chance to name him our speaker. And that was David Ralston. His Johnny Metta's would refer to him sometimes the Chebby Ridge runner. That was Johnny speaking. That wasn't me. But we were a body. We were a family in disorder when speaker Ralston became our speaker. And out of that chaos came order. Just later, we don't always agree on how the order is done, but order is better than chaos any day. And that's what we've had. A steady hand, soft shoulder to cry on, or get through things with, but a steadfast belief in this state and an unquestionable love for this body. Not only to my love for this body. Family is one of those things that none of us can replace. We can make friends that are as close as family, and I have many friends that are family. If it were not for family, none of us could be here. None of us could do what we do. I owe an incredible debt of gratitude to my family, to my mom and my dad. My mom was the one that kind of pushed me over the edge to go on and do this. We lost her a little over five years ago. But my dad, he's been the one that keeps prodding me. Son, you're doing good. Keep on proud of him. My bride. Y'all, we were high school sweethearts. We started dating as juniors in high school. I looked around for a long time. When I locked in, I locked in. I think she locked in to me too. Cindy's been my rock. She's been my foundation for so many things. And as I said a minute ago, just like family, had it not been for her, it would have not been possible at all for me to be here. Your spouses, it would not be at all possible for you to be here without them. You know, every morning my phone goes off with a verse out of Esther that it was funny. A few years ago, it seemed like every preacher that got up in front of us there one year. I think I marked off it with 16 different preachers in our 40 days. Quoted the same verse, born for such a time as this. So my clock goes off every morning at 7.30 to remind me. And quite honestly, it was the words that I needed on many days to know that I'm supposed to be here and I'm supposed to be doing my job. But born for such a time as this, all of us that are in this building today were born for such a time of this as this. Those that have preceded us were that way, those that will follow us were that way because it's God or Dade, that they were born for such a time as this. The great philosopher, Jerry Klauer, those are you young ones in here that don't have a clue who that is. Go looking up on YouTube. Once said, love one another, L-O-V-E, love. God gave us no greater commandment than to love one another. I love you. You have shown your love to me. I'm going to finish the drill, but there will be someone else from the 116th District here next year to pick up the mantle and run on with it. Thank you for your friendship. Thank you for your love. God bless each and every one of you. I'm here for just a moment before we go to the rules calendar. I know many of you want to speak to Chairman England. The chair doesn't want to interrupt the tribute to Chairman England. We're going to go ahead and turn for lunch or recess for lunch and we'll come back in at 12.45.
