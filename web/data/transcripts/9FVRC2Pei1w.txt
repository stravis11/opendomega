TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good afternoon. Hope everybody had a nice lunch. I'm going to go to the meeting to order.
Senator Weiss, I'm going to come up.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Members of the committee, I bring to you a substitute to Senate Bill 59,
Better known to this body as the sovereign immunity municipal sovereign immunity act
It was language that came out of house bill 531. We're just putting it in Senate bill 59 and just providing some liability limits for municipal governments
I'm glad to take any questions if there are any
Okay, don't see any questions. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Chairman members of the committee
Chairman Anderson
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I'm asking for House resolution 885. It's not on the blue sheet. It's on the wall over here
But I understand it isn't eligible
House resolution 885 asked for a study committee looking at the elections procedures in the state of Georgia
Okay, thanks sir. Thank you
Yes, sir. It's got which guy thank mr. Chairman members of the committee. I was asked to present Senate bill 185
We have the author of the legislation here, so I'm going to yield to him if that's okay with you. Okay. Yes, sir.
Thank you chair committee
Senate bill 185 is a bill that requires the Georgia Department of Corrections to create a policy that would prohibit
The Department of Corrections to use state funding to fund transgender
Surgery to any person being held in the Georgia Department of Corrections
Okay, got a question quick part
Thank you, mr. Chairman Senator Roberts and is this really a priority for this body?
Well, based on I did a and I think that's for the body to determine. I think that's why we have the process we have but
Do in a study committee this past summer on the Georgia Department of Corrections and taking a deep dive into the health care costs
Believe me. There's many other areas will attempt to go to as we go through the process to try to make sure our funding and the
The Georgia Department of Corrections has spent more efficiently, not only in health care,
but in operations and other areas, I think that have led to the issues that we currently
have in the Georgia Department of Corrections.
Are you saying that the provision of gender, firm, and care when medically necessary is
causing our budget to explode with respect to public safety in our prisons?
Well, I'll try to narrow down my answer.
I said, it's one of the many areas where we have the issues and I was approached and asked
to do this from a policy standpoint.
And I figure we need to address every issue
within the Georgia Department of Corrections
as we do in other departments throughout the state
to make sure that we're using taxpayers dollars
in the way that they want us to use those dollars
just unfortunate.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, to the Chairman and the well.
As a result of the study committee on the health costs, or I guess it wasn't just the health costs, the study committee did the study committee report out or find the amount of money spent on the health care procedures that are in line 68 through 72 of the bill.
And I don't have the bill in front of me, ma'am, but I believe are you talking about the therapies and other things that are currently being done?
Yeah, how much money has been spent in this year or any summary of years that you all looked at on the procedures that this bill would prohibit?
No, ma'am. I don't have a specific cost what we did is with the RFP process and with the healthcare providers that currently address the RFP and the funding process related to all healthcare issues.
and discussing different ways and one of the issues when this subject matter came up was not
the issue in particular but the fact that there was no policy existing that would allow them to
opt out from doing these types of procedures with taxpayer dollars. Do we have any idea if these
procedures are even occurring? What we have right now is I think I was giving the information that
we currently have five individuals being housed in the Georgia Department of Corrections that
that are currently requesting these procedures.
Have any been performed?
Any of the procedures ever been performed
that the state's paid for?
No, ma'am, I believe that what currently the state
is challenging their responsibility
for providing these procedures.
And then one last question, I know you said
you don't have the bill in front of you,
so I'll read the line.
I've been provided.
You can go back to your plan.
On line 15, the definition of the term state inmate,
it says any inmate in the custody of the department
and for whom the department shall be responsible
for the payment of medical care.
And I was wondering, are there state inmates
in the custody of the department
for whom the department is not responsible
for the payment of medical care?
I think there's some ambiguity to a certain degree
that once an individual is sentenced,
they may be currently being housed in a county jail
or other type of detention system
until they're able to be transferred
into the prison proper.
And I believe that's who they're addressing right then.
because I know there's a, we as the state pay a daily fee
to the county jail or detaining officer
until that individual can be transferred in.
So my understanding was that would be applicable
to those individuals.
So the state wouldn't be responsible for the care
of folks that are in county care.
They're not responsible until they come in.
I think it's a billing issue as to if something is
it would be up to the local sheriff or whomever
to build back to the Department of Corrections
if they wanted to claim expenses were used for health care
that should have been the responsibility of the state.
Thank you.
Yes, ma'am, thank you.
Good afternoon, Miller.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Good afternoon, Senator.
Good afternoon.
To my friend.
So maybe you can help me out with this,
because I'm getting a lot of constituent calls
about the cost of health care, the unavailability of health
care, our high maternal mortality rate, our shortage of teachers, the fact that rent is
unaffordable, the fact that families can't afford to buy home, homes, the fact that
childcare is an accessible, the fact that pre-K hasn't been expanded, and we are sitting
here spending our time talking about sex change operations in prisons.
When you can you tell those working families in Georgia, those parents, those teachers,
police officer shortages, prison guard shortages, why it is that we would spend our precious
time down here charged with fixing big problems for all Georgians across the state while we're
wasting time talking about a problem that doesn't exist.
Well, ma'am, I think we agree that the problem does exist with the fact that we currently
have five individuals that have reached out and the Department of Corrections has reached
out and explained that they do not have a policy.
And I think it's the statement that you made at the beginning is a very clear and honest
bipartisan statement because I think we all get those calls and I agree with the constituents
to give me those calls, whether it's related to this body not putting enough money in to
to offer a fair enough salary to bring in
the Department of Corrections employees that we need
in order to make our prisons more safe.
I think that is a problem.
And all the other things that you mentioned,
I do believe those are problems.
And there's 180 of us on one side and 56 of us
on the other side and we are all tasked
and put ourselves up to attempt to solve those problems.
But I think we all being reasonable men and women
understand that we have to even know
if one bite at a time and that's what we're attempting
to do here.
And I hope we're able to do it all together.
but I do agree with you, I get those same calls.
I appreciate that.
Thank you.
Senator.
And you mentioned five.
And would these five include five folks
who are trying to get a sex change operation in prison,
or are these five folks who just want hormone therapy?
Like, do they just want a pill to take?
Like, who are these five that were?
The individuals, the cases are given.
I was not given the names of the individuals
for obvious reasons.
but they were wanting, once they had been incarcerated
in the Georgia Department of Corrections,
they had chosen to enter into the process of transition.
Okay, and so that could include just medication,
it doesn't necessarily include
like a full-blown sex change operation.
Is that what you're telling me,
or you don't know the actual data?
I'm a law enforcement public safety professional,
I'm certainly not a healthcare professional.
And so I would be, I would not be,
They would not be fair for me to attempt to describe what the multiple types of transitioning
that could be being asked for.
That's fair.
Final question, Mr. Chairman.
In comparison to the five questionable folks who we don't really know that much about,
have you considered the number of, let's say, children who we tried to, hungry children
who we tried to feed over the summer, the number of children who are without health care,
the number of families who are struggling to buy eggs and milk, have you, the number of
women who die trying to have babies in this country, the number of babies who die in the
process of childbirth, all of which we are at the top of the heap on, have you considered
those numbers in comparison to the ambiguous five?
Since the age of 22, in my entering in law enforcement, I considered those numbers each
every day because each and every day on my job I encountered the individuals that you're
talking about. Those that live in poverty, single moms who do not receive proper health care
and everything else and I certainly hope that all of my colleagues in the Senate and all of my
colleagues in the House take it as serious as I do and I hope we continue marching forward to
solve all those problems. Thank you. Okay, leader Heagley you had a question.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I wanted to ask regarding the five that you mentioned, have there
been any lawsuits or any lawsuits outstanding or what has happened specifically to bring
us to this point other than the study because you know the study had a multitude of concerns
regarding the corrections department.
Yes, ma'am, I think there have been court challenges, I have sat down and met with one
jurist pertaining to it but there's a lot of things they cannot discuss openly because of the fact that it is a case and
Those an individual I think you may recall several months back. I think it was an individual that attempted to or
did try to
Deliver an explosive device
Into the judicial system. I believe to the best of our recollection and the reason being because that individual was involved in a case
against the Georgia Department of Corrections,
to obtain this very incident.
So that is probably the most I know
about any of the single individuals,
and I believe the last individual has only recently
become a part of the population
in the Georgia Department of Corrections.
Thank you, sir.
I don't see any more questions.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, committee.
Chairman Clark, need you have a request?
Okay, okay.
All right, thank you.
Okay, any members of the committee are going to call on Chairman Jasper if you would to explain Senate Resolution 8 and Senate Resolution 231.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senate Resolution 8 is our Transportation Committee substitute to Senate Resolution 8.
First off, I've got to thank Abbey Day from the House Budget Research in Josh and Abbey
from G. helping us work these through.
There are 21 road naming resolutions within SR-8, 19 from the House and two from the Senate.
You know, if you take time, it's interesting to look and see what all these great Georgians
have done and made an impact on Georgia if you have time to do that.
and 231 is a little bit different.
It's a very tragic year for law enforcement
and this is our substitute to this.
And we took this bill and put five public safety people
who have fallen in our state.
We put these together, they'll be presented differently
than we normally do.
The individuals will be represented by the county
when they're from, they can be very moving,
very good moment for us to honor the lives
of these gentlemen.
Any questions?
Thank you, sir.
Okay.
