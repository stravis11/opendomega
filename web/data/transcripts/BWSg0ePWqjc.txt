you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you Reverend Freddie Castle from Mother Easter Baptist Church in Motri, Georgia. Both Reverend Castle and Mother Easter Baptist Church Abdistinguished backgrounds and histories. Mother Easter Baptist Church was founded in 1894 in Motri and will celebrate its 130th anniversary this summer. The church is named an honor of the woman, Mother Easter, who gave the founders of the church permission before the original site was built to hold worship services in her home. It's one of the most recognized locations in Cockle County. Reverend Castle was born and raised in Homa, Louisiana, I think I said that right, and received his Bachelor of Science degree from Grand Lake State University in Grandling, Louisiana. He later received a Master of Divinity degree from Morehouse School of Religion at ITC in Atlanta, Georgia. Before being named pastor at Mother Easter in 2009, Reverend Castle served as a youth pastor in Houston, Texas. He also led the congregation of Shiloh, Baptist Church, and Tifton, Georgia, and served as a chaplain for the Georgia Department of Corrections until he retired from that position in 2022. Reverend Castle was joined by the First Lady of Mother Easter, Miss Margie H. Castle. There we go. And they have been married for 30 years and are the proud parents of five children. Two sons, Lee and Ryan, three daughters, Aaron, Caden, and Lydia. And although I'm not a member of Mother Easter, I take pride in the work both the church and Reverend Castle are doing in Southwest Georgia to spread the word of the Lord. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Reverend Freddie Castle. Good to have you. Praise God for all the things that he has done. Good morning to you, my brothers and sisters. It is good to be with you on this special occasion. This is a wonderful invitation. I want to thank Representative Cannon for allowing me this opportunity. I want to thank my lovely wife for being with me. She has been blessed to be my wife for over 30 years now. I hear every night thanking God for me. Forgive me Lord. I am a Baptist preacher, but I have been told that there is a time restrained, so I'm going to shorten it a little bit. I'd like to call your attention to Joshua, chapter 1, verses 1 through 7. The reading of the Lord's words, it now came about after the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, that the Lord spoke to Joshua, the son of Nun, Moses, servant saying, Moses, my servant is dead. Now, therefore, arise. Cross this Jordan, you and all this people to the land which I am giving them to the sons of Israel, every place which the souls of your feet tried, I have given to you. Just as I spoke to Moses from the wilderness and his Lebanon, even as far as the Great River, the river you freightees, all the land of the hitites, and all as far as the Great Sea toward the setting of the sun will your territory be. No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life. Just as I have been with Moses, I will be with you. I will not fail you, nor forsake you. Be strong and courageous, for you shall give this people possession of the land which I swore to their fathers to give to them. Only be strong and very courageous. Be careful to do according to all the law which Moses, my servant, commanded you. Do not turn from it to the right or to the left so that you may have success wherever you go. If I was tottering this message, I would say, bless be the plodders, PLODDRS. Farting is a significant number in the Bible. It signals a state of waiting and preparation. In Genesis, we see Noah and his family shut up in the ark for 40 days. Exodus shows us Moses, 40 days and night without eating or drinking on a mountain standing in the presence of God. Numbers chapter 14 tells us that after God got tired of the Israelites grumbling, he commanded that they would spend 40 years wandering in the wilderness. Mark tells us that Jesus spent 40 days in the wilderness being tempted by Satan. The Christian calendar marks the occasion of Jesus' death and resurrection by observing 40 days of fasting known as Lent. And the Georgia Constitution has deemed that this body shall meet 40 days to do the business of the people of this great state. 40 is an important number. It is a number that has been assigned this chamber. This chamber are now all the Joshua's. The Bible says that Moses might serve it this day. Moses is there, but Israel still needs a leader. Leadership is necessary. So God who called Moses now called Joshua to lead his people into the Promised Land. In this chamber are the Joshua's of this day charged by God just as Joshua of O to lead the people unto new heights. You are elected by the people but chosen by God. Look after the affairs of God's people is a high calling from an almighty God. It is a call to do justice. Justice is a major thing in the Bible. Michael 6 and 8, but in this way he has told you, oh man, what is good and what does the Lord require of you? But to do justice, to love kindness and to walk humbly before your God. Justice is not a theoretical discourse to heat up philosophical, theological debates, but justice is a value to be express and practice in the life of the believing community in order to be reflected in their conduct, in their behavior, both of the leaders and those who are followers, corporations and citizens alike. Biblical justice is associated with truth telling, fairness, equity, doing what is right, giving right judgment, being impartial and being straightforward, upholding what is true and fair is the central thing of the idea of justice for justice underlies everything. As leaders, you are called to execute right judgment, that is justice. Leaders are made and given by God for the benefit of his people. Psalm 75 and 7 says, but God is the judge. He puts down one and exalts another. This chamber has been blessed with many great leaders in his history. You are all standing on the shoulders, reaping the fruit which you have not sown of some of the finest men and women to ever accept the call to lead the people of this great state. The current speaker is now in the seat and holding the gavill of the great speaker, the late David, Rosston, a giant in this chamber. It must be daunting to step in to such shoes. From the highs of election night where the talk is, we are going to do this and we are going to do that. To the moment of extreme anxiety when you realize there is no longer a week. It's just you. Good news is about it that you are never alone. The Bible teaches us that God gives us leaders. Both prepared and in preparation are according to his own heart. He gave the people Abraham, the friend of God. He gave him Moses, Israel's greatest liberator. He gave him Samuel, Israel's greatest judge, gave him David, Israel's greatest king, and now God has given us you. What an awesome privilege to be included in such company, such high company. And to know for certain that God will not favor you any less than he favored those who have come before you if you were trust in him, to whom much is given, much is required. Which such high honors and privilege comes great sacrifice. Many who would envy you do not know the cost of leadership. If you think about it, long hours, stress, frayed and strained and even lost relationships because leaders sometimes have to make hard choices. Often those choices will cause people to ridicule, to judge you unfairly, to think that you're not what you ought to be. Leadership can be very lonely at times. But with God, God's call will come his presence. When you feel like you can't go any further, God has this superscription in many of the Psalms, Cila. Cila, which means lift up. It is a call to the musician to stop, to pause, to take a breath. We stop as we are doing the work that God has called us to do because sometimes we get caught up in our own abilities and our own strength and believe that we can do it by ourselves. And every nine then you need to stop and recognize that this is not your plan, that this is God's plan. You are just a player in the plan. And every nine then you need to stop and ask God. What it is you want me to do at the end of the day when you finish your work, ask the Lord, Lord did I do my best? If I fail, did I at least try to do what you call me to do? God will lift you when you feel like you can't go any further. When you feel that all of your strength is gone, when you're when you're strength is almost gone and your courage is winning. God will step in. And revive you when the stress and strain overwhelms you when fear grips you when frustration and confusion are your only companion. Remember God will never put more on you than you can bear. When you feel like you can't go any more, God says yes you can. He knows you better than you know yourself. God allows problems to come to us because sometimes God just want to brag on you. Remember God chose you because you are one of his best. And God wants everybody to see you in the difficulty and facing the problem that others cannot deal because God especially equip you to deal with the problems of the people of the state of Georgia. And with every problem comes an opportunity for God to show himself strong in you. Other folks will look at you and say I know him. He ain't all of that. How can he be doing what he's doing? Just remind them that you're not by yourself. Remind them that there is a God who is standing in you and behind you and in front of you and around you and he is guiding and leading and blessing you in order for you to bring glory to his name. The presence of God represents many things. One of the things it represents is strength and renewal. Isaiah 4 and 31 say that yet those who wait for the Lord will gain new strength. They will mount up with wings like eagles. They will run and not get tired. They will walk and not become weary. We can never obey God's, God's will in our own strength. But we can always trust God to provide the strength that we need. Philippians 4 and 13 say I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me. If trust, if we trust ourselves we will fail and fall. But if we wait on the Lord, the Lord wait on the Lord by faith, we will receive the strength necessary to complete our journey. Now when the Bible talks about wait, it doesn't mean that you sit around doing nothing. But wait means to hope, to look to God with expectation that God is going to provide the answer that God will provide the resources that God is the one who is going to make up the difference. Whatever you don't have, God is able to make up the difference and so don't worry about what you don't have. Just remember who you really have. God said that he would supply all of your needs to wait on God is to meditate on the character and promise, Savagall, praying and seeking to glorify his name. It is asking God with the right attitude and with the right motive. If you do that God will enlighten

come and give you the answer. It also says that it will renew you. Renew means to exchange. It's like taking all clothes off and putting new clothes on. When you wait on God, God will give you strength. You will trade your weakness for his power. When you wait on God, you can soar in a crisis. When you wait on God, you can run when the challenges are many and you can walk faithfully day by day dealing with the issues of life. But you got to learn how to wait. William carried. William carried the modern founder of missions. It's quoted as saying this. It is much harder to walk in the ordinary pressures of life than to fly like an eagle in a time of crisis. He says, I can plod. That's my only genius. I can persevere in my definite pursuit to this I owe everything. In the quote, here it is, he's simply saying that the most effective leaders are not always the one who seemed to be soaring. Often it is those who are just patiently plodding alone. Bless all the plodders for the eventually will reach their destination. With God's presence, come God's guidance. Psalm 23 and 3 say, he guides me in the path of righteousness for his name. Say, General Assembly God has a stake in your success because he chose you. He called you. He has assigned you and God doesn't sponsor any flops. If you are flopping, it is not God. If you are flopping, if some God doesn't want you to do, but God has promised that he would be with you. Joshua 1 and 5 says, I will be with you. I will not fail you nor forsake you. Hope also comes with the presence of God for hope. Make it not a shame. Often time we can feel that things have gone too far. That there is no way back, that there is no hope. But with God, all things are possible. Oh, our God is so much God that one time he had time to go backwards. Another time he had time to stand still and give his soldiers a chance to fight. He called Lazard back from the dead after being dead for four days. And then one day Jesus and his disciples get on the ship. And Jesus said, we are going to cross the sea. Jesus is tired. He is exhausted. He has been preaching and teaching. So he goes down into the hall of the ship. And he goes to sleep and he is sleeping deep. Up on the top of the deck are these experienced commercial fishermen. They have been in the sea many times. But suddenly a storm come. And it is a storm like they have never seen before. They fear that they are going to die. The boat is filling with water. And somebody remembers that Jesus was on the boat. So they went down and they asked Jesus a question. Carus, not that we perish. As if Jesus is going to perish with them or that he would save himself and allow them to perish. Jesus did not answer them. He simply got up, walked on the deck of the ship and simply said, peace be still. Peace to the wind, be still. And he says, he says, be still to the wave. Now the word that is translated be still is the word. Is the word that a man would use to tell his dog to stop biting. Jesus says to the wave, stop biting the ship. Because as the waves were hitting the ship, they were putting holes in the ship. And the ship was filling with water. But when Jesus came, he told him to stop biting the ship. The winds of stop. The waves of stop. The disciples are no longer afraid during all of Jesus. But everything is not fixed because the ship still has holes in the ship. But this ship was still able to make it to his destination. All I want to say to his I leave is that in this chamber there may be some times when you have some cracks. Well, you have some fishes where you even have some holes in the ship. But if somebody remembers that Jesus is in the house and call on Jesus, he will step up and make sure that you're able to do what he has called you to do. You can make it if you know that Jesus is with you. Whatever you feel like you can't go anymore. Remember, he says I will never fail you. Nor forsake you. Remember, he says I will give you success. If you will just be courageous, be strong, do not be weak and wish you watch your, but stand up for that which is right. And watch God bless this great assembly. Please stand for the prayer. I'll go to my father. We thank you for this time of sharing. We thank you. We praise you for the call and claim you put on these men and women in this assembly. We lift them up to you now, father. Pray that you're pouring into them all that they poured out that you are blessed in and strengthen them and show them what you would have them to do for your people. Bless this chamber in Jesus name we pray. You play the pledge of allegiance. To the flag of the United States of America. For which it stands one mission. Individual with liberty and justice for our.

There are no questions. I yield well. General Manage, you all did the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered.

The Antonal NAC2 men chapter 4, titled 20. The official go to Georgia annotated relating the vocational, technical and adult education. This bill I refer to the committee on higher education. That committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative Stevens to present the bill. Thank you, Madam Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, the House House Bill 112 is a high school diploma for a dirt wound adult learners act. Ladies and gentlemen, we've got over a million folks in Georgia that do not have a high school diploma. Senate Bill 112 creates a five-year pilot program for adults over 21 years of age who dropped out of school to obtain a real high school diploma. Once they get the diploma, they will move into technical college system, apprenticeships, the military, and other high demand fields. Based on this highly successful program, and you've got a handout on your sheet on your table there. It's run by the Goodwill Agents' agencies and nine other states called the Excel Centers. This program has proven track record, used in education to lift people out of poverty and power them to change their life trajectory. Senate Bill 112 creates a public private partnership with TCSG and the workforce development programs. It is envisioned that three proposed sites would be around the state and Savannah, Macon and Columbus. The Excel Centers would be located in a dedicated community building where you can have a wraparound services which is a very key component for these folks 21 years of age to 45 for daycare, transportation, assistance, life coaches, and career counseling. These classes are offered year-round, daytime, and in the evening, and are provided at no cost to the student. Ladies and gentlemen, that's what the bill does. It is a pilot program. We already have successful programs, as you might remember, Senate Bill 204 is one that we did a few years ago that had to do with those up to age 21. We also have an amazing successful program down in Heinsville, Georgia with the Youth Challenge Program again for the youth. This is one that centers on those adults of 21 to 45 that will give them an opportunity to succeed. Madam Chairman, that's what the bill does. I'll accept any questions. You have a couple questions. The Chair recognizes Representative Kenard for a question. Kenard. Do you yield? Yes, sir. Is this also a dual enrollment possibility that can take the high school courses and college classes at the technical college at the same time? I'm sorry. Madam Chair. Is there also a possibility for dual enrollment while they're taking the high school classes to also go to college? You know, that's what Senate Bill 204 did in the way that it worked back when, but this one now would believe you're probably going to need to get your high school diploma first. Again, understands a lot of these folks can't read on a sixth grade level, so they're going to need intensive training before they can move on to that. Thank you. Chair recognizes Chairman Knight for a question. To my friend in the well, isn't it true that as we looked at original versions of the bill, that funding was to be used for all kind of things, including purchases of buildings, et cetera, but through our House Committee process, we've now produced a bill that only allows the dollars that you spend on the education of the person. That's my first poll in the area. Yes, sir. You're exactly right. That's probably the most important piece of this legislation. As you know, the wraparound services are provided by the Goodwill Industries already for the folks that work there. This bill, thanks to the Chairman of the Committee that got this very narrowly crafted so that only the education piece is to be funded. Thank you. Second. Yes, Madam Secretary, part of the area, I agree. But isn't it true that this bill is not necessarily specific, and this is the concern I have, there are several programs out there that wish to get involved in this. It is my understanding, and to my friend in the well, isn't it true that this is not necessarily geared towards one particular program? I'm not sure that this particular bill is geared towards the Excel program, which is primarily housed or will be housed within the Goodwill Industries. Okay. All right. Thank you, sir. The Chair recognizes Chairman Hatcher for a question. Thank you, Madam Proton. Mr. General, and you? Yes, sir. I can't see it in here. I may overlook it and you may have stated, when is the effective date? When does this program begin? The pilot program begin? We have, it's in our 2025 budget as you might recall. It should start, it's already in our budget matter of fact, so it should start right away as soon as we can get it funded. Well, the reason that you'll take another question, is it not true that I was asking because there are differences in what the Senate proposed funding and we proposed funding, so I was very interested in when this would actually begin. Just got a text from the Senate. We got, of course, the governor placed in his budget 5 million, and the Senate just put 2 million back in. It should start as soon as the governor signs the bill. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the questions and if there's no more questions, I'll yield the will and ask for your favorable consideration. The gentleman has yielded the will. The Chair recognizes Chairman Martin to speak to the bell. Thank you, Madam Speaker. I want to do, I do want to speak to Senate Bill 112. It's coming along in Argers Road and while I respect Chairman Stevens talk about the XL program, this bill was in higher education, created and contemplated so that multiple vendors, certainly the Excel program can work with TCSG and be part of that, but so can other vendors. Here in Georgia, with this bill and educating adults that fall into this position, we didn't pick three cities. We didn't pick a vendor. We gave the opportunity for all people that provide this service to provide and in fact, we provided for at least two people, at least two vendors could be more, but at least two vendors would get the opportunity to do this so that we could get a good idea of how the pilot program would work. I will say this as Chairman of Higher Education, we always have people coming to us for allocations of funding for education. The treasure that the state has both in terms of capital and money is limited to do that and this is quite frankly an expensive program. I think Chairman Hatchett, if I can invoke his name, mentioned that earlier with the allocation of resources. So I just wanted to state and be fair to the House that your Higher Education Committee on both sides of the aisle have agreed to focus this program on the people in need, but to focus it broadly on vendors and I would draw everyone's attention to the section of the bill 50 through line 60 that say how this can be offered and particularly in lines 59 through 61 that funds would be distributed to those vendors upon completion of courses toward the attainment of graduation. We're not interested in seat time, we're interested in results. So Madam Speaker, I just wanted to make those clarifying points that if this bill moves forward, there are some differences between the House position and the Senate position and I would ask the House to hold our position. It is focused on people not vendors and with this program we'll get a good idea after the pilot period, but I wanted to make that clear to you all that this is not focused on a particular vendor. This is focused on people in Georgia and I'd ask each and every member to take that consideration and vote your conscious in your district without out you'll the well. The gentleman is yielded the well, the chair recognizes representative Reese to speak to the bill. Thank you Madam Speaker. Thank you Chair Miss Stevens and Chairman Martin for your introduction of the bill. I want to speak to the bill and naturally I am in favor of this bill, but I'm not going to digest the bill itself. I'm going to focus more on the conditions that we have right here in the state of Georgia. Many of you know that I was born and raised in a very small town here in Georgia and Wilkinson County, town called board. And when I think back to my hometown, even right now as I go to visit my relatives that are still in that area, I see individuals that can have opportunities in life if they simply had a high school education. For most of us in here who are very well educated, having a high school education just seems like something that should be so basic should be so easy. But so for so many Georgians every day, something as simple as a high school education is hard to come across. I think it is without question and without doubt that we have one of the best technical college systems in the state of Georgia right here in the nation. And I'm convinced that with the partners that we will have with Senate bill 112, we have an opportunity to extend greater chances, greater opportunities for individuals to simply take care of their families, to feed their families, to raise their children. Because many of you know that an individual that grows up without a high school degree, their children are 50% likely to be high school drop out themselves. This is us ending a cycle of poverty right here with Senate bill 112. This is an opportunity for us to have an impact that would not only impact Metro Atlanta, but take those impacts into the rural parts of the state where we need the most help. And Columbus alone, we have 46,000 people over the age of 18 that do not have a high school degree. This program here will give us an opportunity to give those that are already intimately working in our community. Give them the tools that they need to help make our state better. As we look at maintaining our status here in this state as a great economic driver and engine driver, we have to think about the fact that we must have a qualified workforce to take us along the way. This bill here will go a long way in helping us increase that workforce so that we will have the individuals that we need to do the work right here in the state of Georgia, maintaining our competitiveness right here in the state of Georgia. I'm in full support of this bill and I asked that my colleague was joining us and sending a strong message that here we're not interested in leaving anybody behind in this state. You may have had some challenges early in your life and high school but we want to give you that second chance. We want to give you that second opportunity to pick yourself up by your bootstraps. We live on a premise in our society that if you work hard, if you believe, if you contribute, you too have the right to be successful. This bill here helps us even the playing field and allows everyone who wants the opportunity to be educated, to have that opportunity to be educated and be a productive part of our society. Madam Speaker, I yield the well. The gentleman has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopt in the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted.

Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the past of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. All in favor. Have all members voted? For what purpose does Chairman Dempsey rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not true that our House Committee process added a very important pay for performance component to this bill that was not in the original version that we received. And what this says is that you only get paid if you are advancing and ultimately graduating students with a high school diploma. Chair, the lady knows of which she speaks. The chair recognizes representative Gladney for what purpose does she rise? Parliamentary inquiry, Ms. State, you're inquiry. Is it not true that while there are limited opportunities for members to enter the military with a GED, this bill will afford more allowance for individuals to earn their high school equivalency and to join the military? The chair is certain that the lady knows that of which she speaks had all members voted. If so, the clerk will unlock the machine on the past of the bill. The A's were 143, the days were 23. The bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to Senate bill 520.

judicious here that committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute Clerk or the cap or the chair recognizes Representative Clark to present the bill Thank you madam chair Today I'm excited to be carrying 420 Passionmind I serve in the military as is vital to our security I currently serve in the military at the highest levels and we've discussed the threats to our Now security posed by foreign adversaries Who are tampering with our food supply by owning our agriculture land There are two things that are vital to every country's national security Our water supply and our food supply This bill simply protects our valuable agriculture land and produces That and produces our food supply It also this bill Protects all immigrants who come here to pursue the American dream for themselves While at the same time safeguarding every one of our communities I want to make it clear that I would not be up here supporting this bill if it discriminated against anyone I've received many emails from people who have been fed false information That is nowhere in this bill this bill is straightforward and its meaning and only prevents Foreign adversaries the governments with hostile intent against our nation communities From the own their agricultural lands this bill follows all guidelines of the fair housing law And I'm proud of the hard work that has been put in to this bill I fully believe that the bill were easily hold up and court a lot if it was challenged And and closing I just asked that this body set aside political rhetoric and vote for a bill that protects our national security And all of our people regardless of where they come from and with that I'll take any questions But we spend a lot of time on this bill You can read the bill. It's very simple very straightforward And just simply protects us from this foreign adversaries that threaten our country and our communities My name is speaker. I'd be glad to take any questions You have a couple questions the chair recognizes representative park for a question Thank you madam chair To the gentleman do you yield for two questions? I yield While I appreciate the intent of the bill Is it not true that this bill is providing an exception for foreign agents of foreign adversaries to purchase Agricultural land and military land here in Georgia on lines 59 to 64 In particular given the concerns that you've raised I don't know why we're being a bill to the floor that would allow Foreign agents of countries from foreign adversaries to again purchase agricultural land and military land With the exceptions that have been included here in this bill given the national security interests that you've raised I think what what what we have done on this bill very balanced because you have you have the fair housing So didn't have that balance to hold up in court of law and what Well about in this house is following the law having that balance. So if someone wants to come over here They could have been a past dictator In one of these countries and they're gonna come here live pursue the American dream and they're allowed entry into here Then they're living 12 month I mean six months out 12 months in the United States or two months out of 12 In Georgia We are a country that's wide arm, you know open arms saying hey come here and live But then is it balanced so we know you're coming here to live Not here to buy about our agriculture lands and So just to clarify again you are okay allowing foreign agents of Countries that are foreign adversaries to purchase Millic land their military bases in Georgia and in farms. Thank you one more question if I may Online 76 to lines 81 is it not true that this bill and the bill that y'all are proposing would allow a company such as China To lease land for purposes of agricultural research and development testing developing producing crops Can you help me understand why when multiple times throughout this committee process We've said that food security is one of our top priorities that we are now codifying an exception for a Chinese company or a company owned by one of these foreign adversaries To engage in the development and testing of agricultural products Well, I'll say this I mean we try to work with every country even a foreign adversaries having that balance because you have to Have a balance of what working together right because in the end we want to all be on the same page We do do some research together but When we do that it's always being overlooked keep an eye on what's going on So we've had that balance of we can do research they can come If they're working on studies and all that but we're working alongside them So you know do you able to keep an eye on that and I'll say when you say agents coming over here We have our departments who always keep an eye on a foreign adversaries what they're doing coming over here But the same time we want to be open arms to those who actually pursue in the American dream I just think for purposes of consistency when we're saying national security and particularly talking about protecting our food supply I'm confused as to why there are explicit exceptions in this bill That would allow foreign agents and foreign adversaries to continue to again engage in the testing of agricultural products And to purchase land near military bases here in the state of Georgia by appreciate your answers. Thank you Thank you Chair recognizes majority whip or shut for a question Thank you Madam protein To my friend in the world is Jim and you Are you very good. Thank you for bringing the bill Isn't it true that the intent of the bill is to go after bad actors that may be here conducting the various activity around our military bases? That is true very good Is it also true that currently in the state of Georgia we do have some Companies that are working in good faith With the state of Georgia and with the people of George in the citizens of Georgia To Further the American dream is that not true as absolutely true So isn't it true that while we're seeking to address issues where foreign adversaries are coming to the state of Georgia to conduct nefarious activities such as Surveillance on our military bases such as growing of marijuana like everybody seen in the news recently down in my part of the woods Isn't it true that we're after those folks and not after the folks that are actually here to seek out the American dream to partner with us So we've made an exception for for companies and people that are doing that Absolutely true. We've done do our absolute best with the constitution fair housing Because we are the country of freedom with the country that it's it's the melting pot of the world coming here Chasing freedom. So we want to make sure to follow every law But also have the teeth to protect our communities now nation. Thank you for the bill Which that ought yield the well madam chair and I ask you please vote Senate bill 420. Thank you Gentlemen is yielded the well Members and the wisdom as I say of the rules committee we have um house rule 33.3 Has been uh imposed on this bill so we'll have 30 minutes for those opposed 30 minutes for those in favor 20 minutes for the minority report and 20 minutes for the chair's time or any portion thereof Will begin with Rep. Seattle I was recognized to present to the bill Good morning Let me first say I'm very disappointed and dismayed that I have to speak against this bill today So I'd like to open by making two statements both of which can be true at the same time number one National security and defense against hostile foreign regimes is a vital goal that I and everyone in this body should prioritize Number two SB 420 is a bad bill that does not serve that goal Now before I get into details. Let me just acknowledge the elephant in the room When you're a legislator who looks like me And who has the cultural background that I do No amount of parsing the legal or the social nuance of such bills will prevent the suspicion that I Get and the accusations I will draw for being a legislator who looks like me speaking against it In my two terms in the Georgia General Assembly I personally have been accused of being an agent of the Chinese Communist Party a spy a plant Un-American and a foreign asset and that's just this week For the record I am none of those things in case you need that clarified for you But this reflexive florid reaction and the assumptions that people make about people who look like me My loyalty is my intent Because of what I look like because of the language I grew up speaking because of where my family is from Is in fact part of the phenomenon that makes SB 420 such a bad bill Because SB 420 and the other bills we've seen like it I want to note that this is actually just one of five bills that we've seen Introduce this term including HB 1093 HB 246 and HB 452 from last year These bills aim to weaponize racism xenophobia and anti-immigrant sentiment while wrapping itself in the cloak of national security and patriotism Bills like this Don't protect America Bills like this are on American So ironically the communities that these bills target may understand better Than any of us in this room the threats posed by the foreign adversaries cited in this bill Because some of those who may be targeted by this bill fled those very countries of origin Intentionally She was in set to come to the United States for the promise of freedom and a nation united not just by any one single race Or religion but by a system of democratic principles and the promise of a country we continue to build together In committee earlier this year The representative from Loganville noted that his parents fled and oppressive regime in Cuba In search of a better life for their children As Cuba is considered a foreign adversary on this list cited in this bill His family may well have found it more difficult to realize their brighter future under this law The representative from Norcross notes that he and his family were considered Non-resident aliens for a period of time when they first immigrated to this country from the Philippines And that over his childhood his parents left the state for months Or longer many times both for work and to care for alien family members back in the Philippines This type of behavior is considered essentially suspect in this bill The Representative from the 103rd district the governor's floor later is Korean-American But her last name is Hong Which is a

Chinese name. Under this bill, a real term might think a little harder, might ask a few more questions, might be more concerned about the risk before selling or leasing her property compared to another buyer. This prejudicial treatment of different categories of people, regardless of realized harm, is in fact the core of discrimination. Clumsy bills like this make the classic mistake of conflating immigrants with the countries that they are from. Some basic questions we should be asking here as we read through this bill. How are we to determine if someone is an agent of an adversarial government? Who's doing that investigation? What would trigger that suspicion? And would that suspicion be applied equally to everyone looking to buy or lease property? When we create a disparate impact on potential property owners based on their country of origin, we run into the possibility of violating the Federal Fair Housing Act, which protects people in this country from discrimination when buying or leasing a home. The point was made in an earlier committee hearing that bills like this actually do not target countries of origin, which is a protected class, rather they target alienage, which is not a protected class. So I ask them why this bill doesn't target all aliens. For example, aliens from Canada, from the Netherlands, Italy, United Kingdom, and Germany. And I name those five countries because those are the top five countries owning the largest portion of foreign owned agricultural land in the United States. When you write a bill potentially discriminating against individuals only from certain countries regardless of those individuals, immigration status, regardless of those individuals, criminality, or intent, and regardless of which countries you choose to restrict, you will be violating federal law. Moreover, if our goal is, in fact, national security, there's nothing in this bill that precludes US citizens or legal residents from any other background from taking money, from acting as agents of hostile foreign governments in order to buy property. Because this bill does not target intent, it restricts rights based on national origin, which is illegal. Legality aside, let's put that to the side for the moment. This bill, whether explicitly or not, paints a picture that residents from certain parts of this world cannot be trusted. They are essentially suspect and potentially trade risks simply by dent of their nationality. Think about the message this sends to the international community. Think about the message this sends to the business partners. We've been proud to welcome and cultivate in this state, bringing vehicle and battery, plants, manufacturing, huge technology, and export industries, and thousands of jobs that come with them. Think about what this tells our constituents who have come from all over the world. If this body votes to place restrictions on their friends, families, and neighbors from building the very American dream, the sponsors of this bill cite over and over and over again. I love this country. I love this state. And for that reason, I ask you to vote no on SB 420. There is a way to serve these goals of protecting our national security without writing blatantly discriminatory bills. And there's certainly a better way to serve that goal without trumpeting around the world that Georgia is the number one place to live, work, and raise a family, but then turns to certain Georgians from certain countries and backgrounds and says, except not for you. We can do better than this. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Lady has a question. You yielded the well. Ladies yielded the well. Representative Derek Jackson recognized the speak to the bill. Representative Jackson. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. So here we go again. This body wants to pass a bill that's going to tie up taxpayer dollars in litigation going against federal law state law. And as I listen to the presenter, I put my prepared notes back into my pocket. I just have the bill itself because there was a couple of things, Mr. Speaker, I realize that was mentioned during the presentation of this Senate bill for 20. And that was national security. Something I know something about. Not questioning no one else's military experience, but I served 22 years in a Navy. Seven deployments for combat missions, two special operations. And I served in the Pentagon. And I also served with our allies. And in the Pentagon and with our NATO allies, there are different countries, different ethnicities and races, serving to help the United States to bolster their posture around national security. But as the presenter was talking, I was asking myself, where is the national security risk? I do not see it in this bill. Do not see it in this bill. Lines 28 through 42 has nothing to do with national security. Several loopholes away to discriminate and violate the federal law. I see on page 3, lines 50 through 55. I see loopholes, nothing about national security in lines 50 to 55. And if I sent this bill to my former colleagues at the Pentagon, they would say this bill would do absolutely nothing to strengthen our national security. Lines 58 through 63. I see loopholes. We do not deal with loopholes when it comes to national security. We do not deal with loopholes. We strengthen our national security. It has nothing to do with if someone purchase a home within 10 miles of a military installation. That tells me you know nothing about cyber security. Our number one risk right now in national security is cyber security. That's our number one risk. But it explains to me you know nothing about national security. This bill will not address national security. I see loopholes. I see discrimination. I see something that's unconstitutional. Lines 82 through 91. I see discrimination. It has nothing to do with national security. Nothing. When we are at risk and when we are under attack, we do the right things to make sure we strengthen our security. In 2016, there was no gates around this building and where we serve right now in 2016. But there's a gate on the perimeter of this building. Why? Because January 6th occurred. We strengthen. We do the things that we need to do to strengthen our security. We don't discriminate. We don't discriminate. And we certainly do not say we're doing this towards patriotism. Spare me of that. There's nothing in this bill that's patriotic. Nothing. Nothing in this bill is patriotic. Our country is built around diversity. If you look at NATO, it's diverse. Nothing around security is in this bill. And I yield you all. If you want to talk about national security, you vote no on Senate bill 420. And let's have a real conversation around national security. I yield the well. General Masheed of the well, Representative Liam has recognized speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I want to start by saying that I too quite love America and Americans. Also, yes, national security is very important. Human rights are also very important. And the current governmental regimes in the countries targeted by this bill among them, China, North Korea, Russia, Iran, give rise to many obvious concerns of both. National security aside, with many of these countries being nuclear powers, I want to shine a light on the human rights issues. The Chinese governmental treatment of weagers, fallen-gong practitioners, the Russian governmental treatment of dissidents, LGBT people, among those. Myself, I am part Chinese, but my national origin is, as the representative from North Cross, actually of the Philippines. Now, this country is not targeted by this bill, but it's important that I was born abroad during a brutal dictatorship and lived through the first color revolution of the world that is the yellow, are people power revolution in 1986 to overthrow that dictatorship. And as I've learned, and as I've said, excuse me from this well before, I represent a population that is almost 50% foreign-born immigrants, many of whom have told me harrowing stories of their escape from brutal Soviet, Middle Eastern, African, Southeast Asian, Latin American, and other regimes in the 70s, 80s, 90s, and oughts, all coming to America for a better life and ultimately making substantial contributions to our society, including contributing substantially to our economy here in this state, which leads to my concerns about this bill. I am worried that because of its provisions, many of which are still unclear that it will root out people who are doing good, including for our economy, while doing nothing to help our national security. One of those provisions is stating that this bill does not apply to U.S. citizens and legal residents, but again, the phrase legal resident, as I've said in other bills, a similar to this in committee, has many possible definitions, including within the Georgia Code itself, I a title 49 on social services. Whether or not, as this bill does attempt to cover, there are people are going to be gone for two or more months, that is left unclear. Now in committee again on a similar bill, when I asked that question, whether legal resident could be defined as lawful permanent resident, I noted that in the flora legislation that has already been joined by the 11th Circuit, they at least did define that, but this bill does not. But that is just one problem of vagueness and lack of clarity in this bill. It is that these provisions are both under and over inclusive to meet the interest that it's stating to meet. You are not catching people you want to catch. It was stated in committee that even a foreign government official from one of these countries could by land so long as they are citizens or legal residents, or even if they're not so long as they aren't gone for those periods of time, which is certainly not impossible. I also believe, let's be real, that bad actors, spies, columns, agents, whatever you want to call them, will not be caught or afraid of this bill, who will be caught every day folks. Often again, people escaping from brutal governments of these countries already so traumatized by those experiences and fearful of government yet wanting to make a better life here in democratic America. And who often, more often than not agree with our prevailing opinion on the brutality of these regimes, but who are now under this bill going to be afraid of being suspected as an agent of that regime, a word that this bill provides little guidance even in the current version as to how that, if not be defined, be actually investigated. If you were here to take the term legal resident to mean lawful permanent resident as was stated by my colleague, you would be barring asylies and refugees from countries like Cuba who don't automatically to be clear become quote lawful permanent residents the moment they gain that status. You'd be preventing them from buying land. You're going to strike fear as well in people like my parents before they like myself and all of my family became lawful permanent residents. Before that, we will lawful non-resident aliens, even though we had every intention of staying in America indefinitely and for me obviously ended up doing so. My mom doesn't particularly believe in government. She has a hard time voting even for me because of her experiences in the Philippines and she has to overcome those tendencies every single time she goes to the ballot box. In fact, the first time our family even filled out the US census, my brother and I had to fill it out because my parents were scared of being tracked. Now both she and my dad before and after they bought property here, which is again part of that so-called American dream, would leave Georgia for long periods of time in my dad's case to work still in the United States but not Georgia while my family lived in Georgia. And in my mom's case to go home to the Philippines to take care of family 12 time zones away. We weren't rich so even now we stretch trips when we can do those trips that last few months or at least several weeks so our family can actually spend substantial time together. They would be fearful about this bill and about at least being suspected under it even though they're legitimate actors. Again, it's clear that this bill is specific to certain countries and I've already said I'm not originally from China but again let's be real. The perception from those who implement this bill and on whom this bill will be implemented will amalgamate certain groups together. My parents know this hate against Asian Pacific Americans as it is for other groups is real and so they would have valid reasons to think that this would have an impact on them and that they would be ensnared in the enforcement. You may also think well this bill attempts to exempt residential property and to apply only to residential land but what about homes on agricultural land? Unclear many foreign workers we know work in agricultural rural areas. In the end you might just say tough people like you will have to face some exclusions but we'll still have opportunities if you work hard. To that first I say let us not forget the original colonists who tilled our soil in America and became America's founding fathers were themselves escaping an oppressive British regime and able to claim here agricultural land. Second, I think this is ultimately disingenuous because human rights aside we know Georgia's economy is strong in no small part because of foreign investment in trade so moving away from individuals think of the economic impact at least that this uncertain law will have on businesses and the way that our higher ed institutions who have relationships with these countries for research will have to deal with. That uncertainty is not just from the unclear definitions in the language of this specific bill but also yes from the 11th Circuit litigation that has enjoined the similar Florida law. The law is not exactly the same but it is clear that that order states that the plaintiffs have a substantial likelihood of success based on the fact not on fair housing but on preemption by federal law specifically the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act. I am a securities attorney and have written anti-money laundering procedures for brokers and I will tell you they are extensive so not only are we creating an additional regulatory burden something that we say we don't want but we are doing so in ways that again create that uncertainty not only because this will be litigated but because without litigation even you will have scared legitimate businesses away and that was something that was testified to in committee. I will end by saying I actually do think we need to take a comprehensive look at what businesses were supporting and those who own the means of production. That can be a national security concern. It is just that this bill isn't practical to address that concern. Neal liberalism in no small part it was what has led us to this point and now we are reacting. Part of that is we ourselves Americans are demanding goods and services including certainly foreign goods made faster and cheaper and as I have said from this well before foreign labor is some of our most essential industries work in our most essential industries like agriculture temporary farm workers. So content are we to be suspicious of some of these countries perhaps rightfully so and yet readily in action if not word welcome their goods services parts and labor into our markets. On that point know this we know that the large already most robust businesses will certainly be affected by this. We heard testimony about a legitimate businesses in Florida pulling out and the challenges that was based to logistics in our part of where we would store parts. We know manufacturers are concerned that said even more affected by this bill will be small businesses who especially cannot afford that instability and uncertainty. We should look I agree at the companies we allow to buy our properties and assets are debt but whatever that analysis reveals it will show we need to that much more affirmatively do what we always say report small businesses which are often minority and yes immigrant owned. I would say that those businesses among businesses would be hurt the most those who's grit and entrepreneurship we say we most value. In the end in times of strife foreign wars that America has fought and the threats that we face now from pandemics bioethical challenges deep thanks all of the things we've discussing our ability to withstand challenges will depend on our ability to actually work together to collaborate with people different from ourselves and that is what in my opinion will show ourselves to be infinitely stronger on every possible level than the regimes that we're targeting. We are Americans and we as Americans I believe are better than that and we are better than this bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker I yield the well. Gentlemen as you do the well refer to Roberts recognize speak to the bill and I'm sorry for Roberts. Thank you Mr. Speaker hello colleagues let me start by saying that I firmly believe every single one of us in this chamber wants to keep our nation and state safe. I have heard the testimony of the sponsors of this bill and I understand the fear behind it I also heard a lot about the intent of the bill and I agree with it in concept but there are lots of ways to accomplish national security and frankly this just doesn't just doesn't do it and it's illegal on its face. I am keeping count Mr. Speaker and passing two bills in two days that y'all know are illegal on their face and will result in litigation to be paid for by the Georgia taxpayers is approaching fiscal malfeasance. First I know y'all have been made aware that Florida passed a very similar statute and is currently the subject of litigation challenging constitutional issues of the legislation just last month the 11th Circuit recently granted a partial preliminary injunction finding that there was a substantial likelihood that plaintiffs would prevail on their supremacy clause claims. They are you that Florida's law violates the supremacy clause because this area has been preempted by the federal government since it has created elaborate statutory and regulatory schemes to address this exact issue. It's moving forward in Florida on an accelerated schedule and the district court will hear arguments in just a few weeks. I still believe this law will violate fair housing 14th Amendment due process and equity issues I believe there are also constitutional issues with the law being applied exposed facto to require nonresident aliens who currently own land to sell it within three years all of the requirements requiring them to sell and they either own now or could own through inheriting it or for closing on alone could also lead to constitutional taking claims if the forced sale of those properties would result in a loss of property value. So is there a fiscal note on this bill for the litigation cost that we know will result from passing this bill and y'all I might have left this one slide from my count of illegal bills and expensive bills if I thought it would actually stop spies or foreign adversaries from breaching our national security but this bill will not stop those intent on causing harm. First according to the line 76 to 81 a foreign adversary that is a corporation partnership etc is exempt from being defined as a nonresident alien if they lease land and are using it for agricultural resource development or experimental purposes this confuses me because the testimony and judiciary from the sponsors was that they are concerned about the security of our food supply so how does a foreign adversary corporation leasing land for nefarious purposes versus buying it keep us safe if your answer is that the owner would provide oversight over the tenant maybe but we have lots of examples of absentee landlords in Georgia. Additionally because our laws that grant us to form corporations in Delaware it would be easy for a foreign adversary to circumvent the law without ever identifying here in Georgia they are owned by a foreign adversary. Again those intent on causing harm are not going to buy land with a foreign corporate corporation they will utilize an American citizen as a straw buyer and who is going to enforce these provisions where is the fiscal note on that. Of course we want to give law enforcement the tools to keep our safe state but this is not going to do it and in the meantime our colleagues are telling you that this is harmful to them and their communities this is not the America I'm proud to live in these lot bills do not represent the America I love and will not do what you intend so please stop wasting our time and taxpayers money on these performative bills I yield the well. Ladies you are the well representative Trey and is recognized to speak to the bill you have a couple minutes left representing. Thank you Mr. Speaker so I rise today against Senate Bill 420 and as much of my many of my colleagues have said I'm a proud American I believe in our national security and I do not want the Chinese Communist military or companies that are enemies to our country from having our agricultural farmland and yet this bill does not do that it does not protect us I have read the same National Security Reports that my colleagues have read so let's take a look at line 74 foreign adversary by the United States Secretary of Commerce why are we pointing to a list of countries by a department that promotes trade versus a list from the Department of Defense the Department of Defense has a very long list maybe my colleagues are afraid to name out companies like the China National Chemical Corporation or the China State Construction Corporation why would you point to a Department of Commerce versus the Department of Defense to protect our state to protect our country I think I know why a year ago we brought in China we want China to become our third largest trading partner we brought them through the Savannah ports military Chinese officials through our ports to our farmlands last year so let's take a look at line 76 77 78 oh oh experimental purposes where excluding we're allowing Chinese companies for experimental purposes including testing developing or producing crop production now let me go back to that list we're going to allow the China National Chemical Corporation that Department of Defense said they are an enemy company they are out to hurt us and we're going to give an exemption to come into our state and do experimental agriculture and then sell the fertilizer to our farmers does this make sense it makes zero sense to me this is a roadmap for our enemies the actual enemies not a country the actual entities and corporations to do business in Georgia to harm us just think about it we're turning to commerce to defend us to real estate agents to defend us versus the Department of Defense that lists exactly who our enemies are and with that Mr. Speaker I yield the well gentlemen's yielded the well that completes those that presented opposing the bill now we all hear from those of our in favor chairman parkle chairman Clay Parkles recognize speaking favor the bill you will have up to 30 minutes we have a couple of speakers that all you guys will do be up 30 minutes chairman's recognized thank you mr. Speaker so this bill ensures we're protecting the food supply here in Georgia and ensuring food security for our state by banning adversarial foreign nations from purchasing our farmland it's common sense legislation addresses growing threat to our foreign families our state and our nation's security if we can't grow the food fiber and shelter our citizens depend on here at home where less safe as a state and a nation now I am passionate about this subject I worked on it for two years and I hope to show you my support for it without yelling at you um I think the ones that spoke earlier oh thank you to those that spoke for earlier that would like this to be a stronger bill and I agree I would like to see it stronger but this is what we have this is a good step in in this in this measure let me first say that there's nothing there is nothing in this bill that impacts someone that looks like my friends who have spoken earlier nor does it impact anyone who is living here let me say it again because this does not impact anyone who is living here as long as they're not an agent of a country that is openly hostile to the United States this is also not Florida's bill I got to tell you I looked at Florida's bill not a fan this bill is narrowly drafted it is the best one in the country so the Bible says to be quick to listen and slow to speak and I've been trying to do that I'm not always successful I got to tell you but it's amazing things that you pick up on if you listen other day I was listening and I heard someone speak from this well and they use the phrase gilding the lily I got to tell you I never heard that one so I looked it up here's what it says spalling something that is already perfect by trying to improve it now I like that saying not sure I could use that back at the house but I learned something and I often learned by listening and observing and I got to tell you I love stories so one of my favorite television shows is Andy Griffith my wife and I watch it every night before we go to bed I know wild times at the Berkle House but it works for us at least we don't read Georgia code before we go to sleep and there's an episode where Thelma loose cousin Martha mere grace visits and Andy and Barney can't go to the

And so let's find a date for Mayor Grace, who is, let's just say, a little plain and appearance. Enter Gomer. Born in Andy Gomer to take her to the dance, and when Gomer asks if she's pretty, Andy says, she's real nice. She's real, real nice. What Andy's trying to do is to change the narrative. Sometimes up here we kind of get sidetracked. Our passions obfuscate. We've heard things today about this bill that are not accurate. I'm not going to speak long. My general observation that at this point I'm not going to convince you to vote for the bill if you already decided not to. I just want to point out some of the things that this bill actually does. It does not violate fear housing. Alienage, country of origin, has two separate things. To further this point, residential property is specifically excluded from being impacted by this bill. In fact, listen to this. A leader of a foreign country that is openly hostile to the United States can purchase a house directly beside a military base and this bill doesn't touch it unless we make it stronger. This bill is about protecting national security and our nation's food supply. Insures our farm community has ability to feed and close Georgians and the world. Insures those who wish to come here legally and pursue the American dream can do so. It ensures that the pastor who has experienced religious oppression in a country labeled as a foreign adversary can come to the great state of Georgia and work, farm, and raise their family just as I have chosen to. This bill only prohibits non-resident foreign adversaries that are agents. If you are a resident alien in this state, this bill does not apply to you unless you are an agent of a foreign government. This narrowly targets non-resonance businesses and countries that are openly hostile to the United States from requiring foreign land. There is an exception. We talked about the exception for residential properties and the other one is for the research and development for agricultural purposes. There are provisions for good actors in this bill. This bill is only about protecting our food supply that is a national security concern. We must ensure our number one industry has ability to produce food, fiber and shelter for the state, for the nation, and for the world. Twenty-four states, twenty-four have enacted similar legislation with another eleven having bills filed. I, as I have to tell you, I think it's the best. The bill you have before you is measured and fully vetted. I have been in countless meetings with many lawyers over two years in drafting this legislation. Now those of you who know my affinity for lawyers, you have to realize that Clay took one for the team on this one. Please vote for this bill that protects our nation and our state. So I will exit before I guild the lily and ask you to vote yes on what this bill actually does because black ink and white paper trumps what I or anyone else says. Thank you. Gentlemen, as you were at the well, Representative Chas Cannon has recognized the speak to the bill. Representative Cannon. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm not a very emotional guy and I won't give very emotional about my remarks on this bill. I'll just give you my perspective and let's you decide. I was lucky enough to be born and raised on the sixth generation family farm in South Georgia. And now I'm lucky enough to be raising my own two children there. But besides being lucky, I had the distinct privilege of serving our country in uniform for over 20 years. Now this does not give me some sort of special qualification on this topic, but I think it does give me some perspective, including having a top secret S.E.I. clearance. And that is why I rise today to support SB 420, a bill that addresses this critical issue concerning the ownership of land and proximity to military facilities. This legislation seeks to protect our national security interests by prohibiting non-resident aliens from certain adversarial countries, from acquiring agricultural land or any other land areas within a 10 mile radius of military installations. As you all know, our military installations play vital role in safeguarding and protecting the freedoms we cherish as a country. It's imperative that we take proactive measures to ensure the integrity and security of these installations and this bill is a crucial step in that direction. The purpose of the bill is simple to deter potential threats to our national security interests. This type of policy is not out of line with those of us who have been station on military bases are accustomed to. Like the gentleman from the 68th, I too spent nearly five years working at the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. And if my wife, sweet little Beth wanted to visit me at work on occasion, I had to sponsor her name for entry, register her name with the Pentagon Security Office. She had to submit to a background check, have valid government issued photo ID and pass through multiple layers of physical and arm security just to get inside to see me. If those requirements were not met, she would have been denied entry. Not based on her looks, not based on where she's from, she's not from China, she's not from Cuba, she's not from Iran, she's from Maltry. Now those of you that know Beth, little five foot to Beth, know that she wouldn't hurt a flea. But those entry requirements of the Pentagon were established for a reason. It's important to note that this bill exempts the acquisition of residential property from its provisions, as the speaker before me said, thereby ensuring that individuals have the opportunity to reside near military bases while still allowing us to address this broader issue of security. So in summary, SB 420 is both a prudent and necessary measure to protect the integrity of our military installations. I know these places. I spent nearly half my life living and working in and around them. They are critical components to our national security. And so I would simply ask, humbly ask, that we support this bill and demonstrate our commitment to the safety and security of our fellow Georgians and to the people of our nine states. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Gentlemen, as you do the well, Chairman Meeks has recognized the speech of the bill. Chairman Meeks. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to circle back around to what this bill is really about. And for those of you who know me and know me well, know that for the better part of 25 years, I've had the opportunity to be involved in agriculture policy at the highest levels in our country. And while I've never served in the military, I stand here today because of every single individual who has served and I greatly appreciate their service. And somewhere around 20 years ago, I was that in Henry County attending a foreign bureau dinner on behalf of the gentleman that I worked for. And most people know that when you're a staffer for a congressman or a senator, you really don't have an opinion because your opinion is the boss's opinion, right? That's why you're there. And during this meeting, I had a question that was asked of me of what is your personal opinion about agriculture in our country? And I said, well, the boss's opinion is this and they said, no, we don't want to know his opinion. We want to know yours because you're the one that talks to him every day. I said, well, sir, the way that I look at it is my generation and a couple of those before me in this country have never been hungry. And I said, that is the reason why I work every day like I do on agriculture policy. So that we don't go hungry. We have hunger in our country. But as a nation, we have the ability to produce the highest quality, cheapest, most affordable, most abundant food supply of anywhere in the world. And ladies and gentlemen, we can only do that on land. Land that we own. Land that we control. Now ladies and gentlemen, what this is about is our ability to continue to feed ourselves. Take a look around the world and look at those countries who have had blockades put in place where they can't get food in. I don't have to tell you what's happening. You know, this bill is simply about Americans being able to feed Americans in the story. Because if we can't feed ourselves, we can't defend ourselves in my opinion. That's why I'm supporting the bill and I want to ask for your favorable consideration of House Bill 420, Ms. Speaker, I'll yield the well. Gentlemen, is yielding the well? Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none of the previous questions ordered. We'll move on now into the minority report. We'll park up to 20 minutes. Chair is time. Chairman Gunther, up to 20 minutes, allocated UC Fit. We'll park as recognized to speak to SB420. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. First can I just say that as a Georgian and as an American, it is a shame that my Asian American colleagues have had to come to this well to defend their patriotism and try to speak against the bill that we fear will lead to discrimination against Asian Americans. Two, only one other state has passed a law like this and that is Florida and that has been enjoined temporarily by a federal court. Three, if you care about food, take out the exceptions in this bill that allow Chinese companies to experiment on agricultural policy here in Georgia. How much more contradictory can you get? Now I rise to oppose Senate Bill 420 because it is preempted by federal law. It is contradictory and because I fear it will lead to racial discrimination and irreparable harm against American citizens, aversion and Hispanic descent, along with immigrants and refugees who've escaped persecution to come here and pursuit of the American dream. I understand the intent behind this bill to protect Georgia agricultural land, along with military facilities from foreign adversaries. However, as part of this debate over the past two years, I have not seen and I do not believe the author or any supporter of this bill has presented any written information from any national security or state public safety apparatus detailing the threats, dangers and the extent to which foreign adversaries possess or have a possessory interest in land here in Georgia. All I have heard is fear mongering, politicking and how we need to get tough on China. Given the seriousness of this issue, what a shame that it appears a majority party is once again legislating based on fear and not the facts for political gain to the detriment of minority communities. While I appreciate efforts to mitigate harm and improve this bill by addressing the facially discriminatory aspects that would have blatantly violated the Fair Housing Act's prohibition against discrimination on the basis of national origin, unfortunately I think this bill will still cause great harm to Georgians and may likely be tied up in courts and litigated at the expense of Georgia taxpayers. Again, I understand the sensitivities around this issue that has national security implications and the balance that we must try to find between our liberties and our security. Personally, while it is difficult for me to stay angry or to hold a grudge, I do not forget very easily. I remember last year when I raised questions about the constitutionality of this bill and committee, I was asked by a Republican chairperson here in this body whether I was a member of the Chinese Communist Party. I am not. Now I am sure that comment was made in just, but unfortunately it is a comment I have heard my entire life growing up as an Asian American here in the state of Georgia. For those who may not know, I am born here, this is my home state and I am proud to be an American. I am the son of immigrants from Korea and the grandson of refugees from the Korean War. My grandparents and family lost everything when the Chinese Communist Party entered the war in October of 1950, crossing the border between China and North Korea and support of North Korea against South Korea, the United States and its allies from the United Nations. When my mother was just three years old, conflict had reached her doorstep. Grabbing what they could in the middle of the night, my grandparents, mother and two uncles headed towards a southernmost tip of the Korean peninsula. One of my uncles, whose name I never learned, did not make it. He passed away or remains alive in North Korea today. Like so many refugees of war, my family lost everything and had a start all over. They lived in a refugee camp. They slept on dirt floors. One of my uncles was born in a broken down ambulance on the side of the road. The Korean War devastated the Korean Peninsula and the imposition of the 38th parallel divided families that remained separated even today. Within the harm inflicted by the Chinese Communist Party on my family, I can assure you this is not an issue I take lightly. It would be easy for me to vote yes to look tough on China. That'd be good politics for me. However, as an American citizen, I've sworn to defend and uphold the Constitution of the United States of America. Unlike some members here in this body, I will not put political gain and self-imvision before the best interests of Georgians and the people and communities I serve and represent. I will not vote for legislation or take action that I believe undermines and defies the United States Constitution that I've sworn to uphold. As an American, I believe it is a duty of every generation to perfect our union, to live up to our highest values of freedom, equality, and justice, to maximize individual liberty for all, to ensure equal dignity and the protection and equal dignity and protection under the law, and to ensure justice for all. Unfortunately, unlike some of the Republican Party, I think our best days are ahead of us and that we do not need to go backwards to make America great. If we are to successfully do the hard work of perfecting our union, we must understand our shared history, the good and the bad. We must understand that the injustices and inequities we see today are inherited from the sins of the past. In knowing our history and being clear-eyed with the challenges we face today, we can move forward and ensure our nation remains the indispensable nation to the world and a model of a thriving, representative democracy that empowers we the people. Knowing our history and being driven by fear and political self-ambition, however, we will only end up repeating the mistakes and the sins of the past, just like this bill we have before us today. This bill and its many iterations are eerily similar to alien land laws. If y'all did not know, there were a series of laws enacted in the late 19th and early 20th centuries which prohibited non-citizens, especially specifically Asian immigrants from owning agricultural land or in some cases any real property. These laws were motivated by economic and racial factors and were widely considered to be discriminatory and racist, similar to redlining and racialized zoning laws that prevented African Americans from purchasing property and white neighborhoods. More than 50 years, more than 20 states codified some version of alien land laws like this bill. It was not until the 1948 landmark Supreme Court cases, Oyama, V. California and Takahashi V. Fish and Game Commission that these racially discriminatory laws were struck down as unconstitutional in violation of the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause which guarantees equal protection of the law to all persons, citizens and non-citizens within a state's jurisdiction. Today these unconstitutional alien land laws are no longer in effect in any state in the United States. The last remaining state to have an alien land law was Florida in 2018. How ironic that Florida under Republican leadership became the first and only state that has passed similar legislation like this in 2023. What happened with Florida's discriminatory law, some of my colleagues mentioned this earlier today? On February 1, 2024, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals stopped or enjoined pending appeal Florida's law as a two plaintiffs because of the substantial likelihood that it would be found to be preempted by federal law under the U.S. Constitution's supremacy clause, specifically 50 U.S.C. Section 4565, the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 or FURMA. FURMA expands the jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign Investment United States to address growing national security concerns over foreign exploitation of certain investment structures which traditionally have fallen outside their jurisdiction. In concurrence, Judge Abu Dhu of the 11th Circuit wrote that she would have granted a preliminary injunction based on the substantial likelihood of success that the Florida bill like this discriminatory bill violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. In that opinion, she wrote, the 14th Amendment protects citizens and non-citizens alike meaning both are entitled to equal protection of the law of the states within which they reside. Because the impact of the Florida bill served as a blanket, a blanket ban against Chinese non-citizens from purchasing land within the state, Judge Abu Dhu found that the new Florida law blatantly violates the 14th Amendment's protection against discrimination. Similarly, I'd argue this bill is clearly preempted by federal law. As previously mentioned, the Committee on Foreign Investment United States already scrutinizes real estate transactions that could jeopardize national security. The Supreme Court has already ruled that the federal power supersedes state attempts to legislate in traditional areas of federal domain, foreign relations and immigration. And certainly when it comes to matters of national security, the federal government is the primary and usually sole authority which would make state efforts to legislate in that area unconstitutional and violation of the supremacy clause. With respect to the equal protection clauses of protection of non-citizens against discrimination, I appreciate the efforts made to narrow the scope of this bill by defining non-resident alien as someone who is an agent of a foreign government designated as a foreign adversary. However, as I've mentioned earlier, I remain confused as to why there's a loophole, this temporal condition imposed on line 21 and 26 that allows foreign agents who live in Georgia year round to purchase agricultural land and land near military installations. Doesn't make sense to me. I remain equally perplexed in that multiple Republican legislators have stated that this bill is focused on Chinese nationals while at the same time China remains one of the top trading partners for Georgia's agricultural exports that exceeded $5.8 billion in 2023 according to the Georgia Department of Economic Development. Again, I've heard multiple times about how this bill is only about protecting the food supply, our food supply from foreign adversaries. And yet, online is 38 to 43 if that's the correct line bill numbers given how many iterations of this bill we've seen, including one that came out just a few hours ago. There is an exception here in this bill that you're voting on to allow corporations owned by foreign adversaries who lease land from its owner to use such land for agricultural research and development. If you all really believe all the rhetoric that China is coming after America would it not make sense for the state of Georgia to divest entirely and stop all trade with China or is that a step too far because it hurts your bottom line? Given the gaping holes in this bill and the perplexing contradictions of what is in the bill and what y'all have said, in my humble opinion, any potential security benefit this bill may bring is greatly outweighed by the potential irreparable harm and racial discrimination that may result again against American citizens of Asian and Hispanic descent. This bill imposes a mandatory duty on Georgia real estate agents or brokers to timely disclose the requirements of this bill to any prospective buyer or seller and makes the felony and a fine of $15,000 to anyone who intentionally violates his bill. With the threat of a felony hanging over them, why would a real estate agent, especially a commercial real estate agent, want to work with or engage with anyone who may look or appear Chinese or Asian or as if they are from a country on this foreign adversary list? Looking up here in the deep south, I can't tell y'all how many times I've been called Chinese. When people first meet me, they can see that I'm Asian, but they may not be able to distinguish whether I'm Chinese, Japanese or Korean, whether I'm a citizen or non-citizen, whether I'm an Asian of a foreign government or someone who loves his country here in America. Let's be honest now, how many of y'all on both sides of the aisle, how confused me with Representative Long-Tran and Representative Marvin Lim? It's okay, I can't tell the difference between half y'all anyways. It's okay, but it speaks to the point here in this bill. If a real estate agent finds out that a prospective client is Chinese, how do they determine whether or not they're a foreign agent? Is a realtor's obligation under this bill simply to disclose requirements of this bill? And if they find out someone is a Chinese national, do you think they proceed with such a transaction at the risk of a felony and a $15,000 fine? With respect to enforcement, will the legal counsel from a local government or attorney general independently verify all real estate transactions involving agricultural land or as suggested in committee pro-hypothetical will they rely on the tips of neighbors who have fears of some Chinese looking person moving into the neighborhood? Will it be the obligation of any Asian or Hispanic Georgian to demonstrate there not a foreign agent to purchase land here in the state of Georgia, just like my Asian American colleagues have had to come down here to this well to defend their patriotism? Passage of this bill will cast a shadow of suspicion on any Asian or Hispanic-looking person who may want to purchase agricultural land or land near a military installation, even if that person may be serving in our armed forces. That is a bill y'all are trying to push through. That is a bill that is emanating and coming out of your party today with a shame. The uncertainty and fear generated by this bill will likely lead to discrimination on the basis of race against Americans of Asian and Hispanic descent. We saw this with the rise of discrimination and violence against Asian Americans in the midst of the COVID pandemic when twice impeached Trump who wants to be a dictator and his mega- Republican supporters use terms like the China virus that fan the flames of xenophobia and anti-immigrant sentiment. This led to old elderly Asian Americans literally getting attacked and beaten and broad daylight. As an Asian American who has learned his history, I can see where this road leads. And I'm concerned, as I've repeatedly said, as to the direction of the Republican party today, because we've seen where that's led before just a few years ago. Asian American discrimination has a long and complex history, particularly during times of crisis and in moments of fear and uncertainty. From the Chinese Exclusion Act, that ban immigration from Asia and prevented all Americans of Asian descent from becoming citizens to the forced relocation and internment of more than 120,000 Japanese Americans to the rise and hate crimes and discrimination against Asian Americans fueled by racist rhetoric and disinformation amidst a COVID-19 pandemic. It seems we may not come as far as we thought, with respect to living up to our highest American principles and values of ensuring freedom, equality and justice for all. As a proud son of Georgia and as an American citizen, I will always stand and fight to defend and uphold the United States Constitution. And I will always stand and fight back against these dangerous bills that may lead to racial discrimination against the irreparable harm a bill like this may cause so many Georgians. And so for all these reasons, I hope each of you will join me in voting no to SB 420. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I will happily yield to any questions that members may have. And if there are no questions, I will yield the well. Chairman, I have no questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Are you the well? He's yielded the well. Well, now we've won a chairman's time. This bill came from the judiciary committee chairman Gutter is recognized, speak to the bill. Chairman Stan Gutter. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today to express my support for Senate Bill 420. The bill that addresses a critical issue raised concerning the ownership of land in proximity to military facilities. This legislation seeks to protect our national security interest by prohibiting non-resident aliens from acquiring agricultural land or any other land areas within a 10 mile radius of military installations. Our military facilities play a vital role in safeguarding our national security.

security and protecting the freedoms we hold dear. It is imperative that we take proactive measures to ensure the integrity and security of these installations in Senate Bill 420 represents a crucial step in that direction. Similarly our agriculture land plays a vital role in keeping our nation fed and supplied and must be protected from foreign adversaries. At least 25 24 states have an active legislation regulating foreign ownership of real property in the United States. 20 other states have introduced legislation regulating foreign ownership similar to this. This measure is not intended to discriminate against any particular group but rather to safeguard against potential threats to our national security interests. It is important to note that Senate Bill 420 exempts the acquisition of residential property from its provisions thereby ensuring that individuals have the opportunity to reside in the vicinity of military installations while still addressing the broader issue. Senate Bill 420 is a prudent and necessary measure to protect the integrity of our military installations and uphold the security of our nation. I urge my esteemed colleagues to support this bill and demonstrate our unwavering commitment to safeguarding the interests of the people of Georgia and the United States. And I want to point out one other thing is that we added House Bill 1247 to this bill, a bill that provides for transfer on death deeds and it passed this House 171 to 0. So for that reason I would ask you to please consider a positive vote on this bill. And I yield the rest of my time to my good friend Martin Montahan. Chairman is yielded this time, a portion of his time anyway to represent Martin Montahan. Representing Montahan. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I mean thank you Mr. Chairman and members of the House. Today I rise in support of this good measure. You know we've had a lot of folks stand up today and talk about their backgrounds and what they're from, what that means to them. And I think as someone who sits on the other side of the aisle, I'd do the same. You know my father came here in the 1970s on a plane from Iran, which was then an ally to this country. We had great leadership in that country. And just a few short years later we had an Islamic regime that toppled an existing government. And I don't want to bring freedom to its knees in that country. It brought every single citizen of that country to their knees. It made them bow to a tyrannical Islamic sharia law that has never been seen before. Totally destabilizing the Middle East. That has in the time since done nothing but tried to undermine the United States of America. It has spent its fortune on Ola, on building IEDs, delivering them to enemy states and killing our soldiers. That is what a foreign adversary is. That is what these countries that are listed in this document here today are doing to our country. And we should take heed. Let's talk about some other countries. According to the last three FBI directors in this country, the last three, including the current sitting FBI director, FBI director Chris Faray, he said that China was the number one national security threat to this country. That's my partisan. I don't care if you voted for red or you voted blue. I can tell you today that both agree that China is the number one threat. Let's talk about a congress who's moving too slow to protect states like ours. Committees like CIFIAS, those who regulate foreign investments, foreign money, technology in our country, who are so slow to act that the technology that are in their band list are half a decade old, too slow. That is the mandate for us to act. That is why we're here. In 2018, China passed a law that said that any company that is partially owned by the government of China must take any information and deliver it back to the Communist Chinese regime. They must do it. They're ordered to do it. Let's talk about the fact that if we went as American citizens to these countries and we said we want to buy your farm land, they would laugh in our faces. I don't think there's a single running official today that will allow you to buy thousands of acres of their farm land in the middle of Shi-Rais or Teirin. What a joke. Over the last two years, eight instances will be espionaged by the Chinese and their partners. Eight instances that have been found by RFBI by partisan to either undermine, embarrass, or extort elected officials, corporate partners, to steal proprietary information. These are foreign adversaries. That is who we're dealing with today. This bill is not about xenophobia or racism. These catch words that continue to be thrown around. I'm deeply offended. It's about taking action where Congress has failed our state. It's about taking action where they have failed our state. They certainly have. They certainly have. This is about foreign adversaries. Breathe the bill. I enjoy doing that. Breathe the bill. It's in there. Multiple times talking about foreign adversaries. These foreign adversaries that are acting against us. I heard from the wea that this was rhetoric. It's far from rhetoric. Confirmed instances of undermining us. Embarrassing us. Stealing our technology again and again. That's not rhetoric. That's the right action against our states. I mean states. I don't even mean federal government. I mean states. Stealing information. Stealing technology. Huawei phones. DJI drones. Lex Mark Brenners. Lenovo computers. All of these products have been confirmed to steal information and send it back to China. Why? Because they are Chinese owned. Some of you probably didn't know that did you. But they utilize that technology to send it right back to China to the mainland. I heard from this wea that there has been only one other state just forward to the House Passes bill. There have been countless including the long-star protection. Long-star infrastructure protection, they have been Texas. Were they found that Chinese nationals, Communist Party nationals, were actually mind the land close to military installations? And critical infrastructure to undermine this country's interests. Why? Because Congress has failed to act and last a problem. So here we are. We're the prudent step for the future. We're the way to remedy a portion of those problems. Instead of being congratulatory, which we should be on such a great piece of legislation, we get attacked for racism. I'm offended. At the end of the day, Lord, things that we have to come together in a bipartisan measure to support. And when it comes to the national security of this country, when it comes to the safety of our families, the business interests of our business community, we must stay. And with that, I give the rest of the time to or portion of the time to whip merchant. James merchant is recognized. Speak to the bill. The gentleman you ordered the well. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It was a little out of order. I thought I was coming next, but I'll do the best I can. Let me tell you a little story real quick. It won't be long. But let's see. August 2014. Two Chinese nationals, agents of Chinese Republic. In Rikki and Taiwan Huang purchased 44 acres of agricultural land in Pierce County, Georgia, which is my neck of the woods. So what's your, this is a real life example of what we're trying to fight against. Well, February of this year, come to find out these two gentlemen had set up a $22 million grow operation growing marijuana right there off the highway 84 right near town. That is what we're talking about folks. They're seeking to find innocuous places to purchase property and they're conducting the various activity. I mean, you're talking about a $22 million grow operation that I've driven by at least a hundred times this year, this year I've driven by it a hundred times. It's say, this is what we're after. We're not after and I can point you to the bill. We're not after anybody that's a United States citizen. We're not after anybody that has a legal resident of this country or state. One of the interesting arguments I heard was the argument about litigation costs. Now I can point you right back to December folks and we heard some very impassioned speeches up here talking about how, I mean, we, I can just cut to the chase. We're racist, Republicans are racist and we are drawing racist maps and these are unconstitutional. We were sworn to uphold the Constitution and you are out here drawing racist maps. I heard it from right here, so from my friends on the other side. I recall, I know it and that wasn't long ago. I feel like I've been in session for a year but I remember that and it's okay for us to disagree in here and I expect we're always going to disagree on some issues, particularly some like this. But what would we find? Those maps were upheld and so what I'm telling you is we, we've got to figure out a way to come together and find some middle ground here on issues that frankly for both of us are problematic, both parties I mean. Let's come together and find a solution to just poke holes. You know, it seems to be a defense attorney, right? You know, all you got to do is poke holes in the case. Let's offer solutions, offer solutions, let's address what we're after. We do that a lot of times but sometimes politics is too much and we must divert from a reasonable mindset. But I'll tell you what happened. The judges found not only that our maps weren't racist but they were constitutional. So I would say to you when you're talking about litigation costs, please, please, please stop bringing frivolous lawsuits, stop bringing them because you're pandering to your base as you're saying that we are doing, stop bringing lawsuits that are frivolous in nature, stop doing it and our citizens will stop having to pay or foot the bill to defend frivolous lawsuits. That's my perspective. I recognize there are times that you're right. You bring lawsuit you win. But it's unfair to characterize everything we do up here as something that's going to cause our taxpayers to have to pay for defense when clearly we won and we lost. So that's not fair. You got to be fair. To my friends, you point out racism. I'll stand right next to you and I'll fight racism. Right now, right now, currently this bill is not racist. Is it racist against Russia? Is it racist against Iran? China? No, it is not. There's nothing racist about it. And I'll point to you the fact that we're referencing 15 CFR 7.4, which is a Biden administration list that's coming from the Biden administration, the Biden Secretary of State, not the Republican Secretary of State. This is the federal government's list that has been dictated to us by the Biden administration. We're not saying this isn't the Trump administration list. This is the Biden administration list. So I'm asking you, folks, let's be straight down the middle. I'll call them balls and strikes. You can't just characterize anything we do as being racist and being, you know, attacking minorities. That is just, I'm at the point where it's falling on deaf ears because we continue to say that, but we continue to keep winning in court. We continue. If you look back to our maps, that is the closest example I can tell you where we've had multiple people come to this well and give really good speeches and you're just wrong. And that's the best I can say. I appreciate the opportunity to debate with each and every one of you. I appreciate that. This is the process and I think it's the best process we have. But I just implore you, let's push away from the ends of our parties and let's come to a space that we are predicating or crafting bipartisan legislation to get after the issues that we clearly see are happening in the state. And you said you couldn't point to anything and was fear mongering, but I just pointed to you one case, happening in my neighborhood. Happening in my neighborhood where you have a grow operation that I don't know how many folks that they've been supplying for how long, at least since 2014 they've been growing. They're now under arrest. That's what we're after, folks. We're not after anybody that's seeking to chase the American dream, that's a legal resident. And after anybody that's here to work with Georgia or here to work with the United States, we're after bad actors. I think we all know that, but I want to make sure that I say that because that's what we're after. If you see racism somewhere, I will stand in front of you and I'll fight it. But just to say everything's racist, that is just falling on deaf ears. I'm tired of it. I have been called that since I have been born, I feel like, and I am not that. I am not that. And the majority of the people that I know are not that. Let's get past that. Let's move forward and just be done with it. I'm done with it. Mr. Bigger, I yield the will and appreciate your favorable consideration for this bill. Let's get moving. Let's get some lunch and let's get out of here. Gentlemen, is yielded the will of that completes the chair's time? We're ready to go. Is there any objection to withdrawing the committee's substitute? Chair has none. The committee's substitute is withdrawn. Is any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules? Chair has none. The rules committee's substitute is adopted. Is any objection to agreeing to report the committee which is favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair has none. The committee is agreed to. The chair, this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no in the clerk. We'll unlock the machine. Have all members voted for what purposes represent even Roberts rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State inquiry. Isn't it true that the way the majority party drew the maps in 2021 was found by the federal courts to violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. So that litigation was because of how they were drawn in 2021 and then it required a special session to draw five majority black districts. Isn't that true? Sounds like that's some. I know we had a special session to draw those five maps. For what purpose does the deputy general rise? Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. State you inquiry. Isn't it true that I represent Henry County which holds the second largest amount of farmland that has been bought by Chinese entities in state of Georgia? I'm sure the lady knows what she speaks. I didn't know that. Further inquiry. State you inquiry. Isn't it also true that I have voted yes today on this measure? Because constituents of mine of all backgrounds and of both political parties have made it abundantly clear that they are sick and tired of foreign entities buying up our farmland and over developing our community. I'm sure that's the lady's opinion. For what purpose represents Sains rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State you inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that as the son of immigrants and more pertinent as the representative for Georgia's only nuclear submarine base that I strongly support this measure and urge all my colleagues to as this is not about national background or origin but about national security that all citizens of all backgrounds benefit from? I'm sure the gentleman believes the Woody State speaks because he lives there. For what purpose is rip I'm going to take two more. For what purpose is representative Holly rise? Parliament is we agree. State you inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that of the force said Henry County of which I am the chair that in that county we although we have land that may be purchased by those who are from China we are in no way through this initiative here making our military any safer. I'm sure the gentleman knows where the military is around Henry County. I don't. For what purpose is majority of the frustration rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State you inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that a Democrat U.S. Senator recently said that Congress needs to do more to protect American agricultural security and prevent our foreign adversaries from controlling our country's food supply while also gaining access to land near sensitive military sites and is it not further true that the Democrat Party here today are the ones who are making this political because this is simply an issue of national security and ensuring that Georgia's number one industry agriculture is protected. I'm sure the gentleman believes in what he speaks. Have all members voted. If so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of Senate Bill 420. The yeas are 97 the days are 67 this bill haven't received. The requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Okay, we're going to break for lunch. Recognize Chairman Parrish. First I'm going to recognize Representative Baysmore for an announcement. Representative Baysmore is recognized for an announcement. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Just a reminder that the South Folk Indelegation will be meeting in room 216 at 1 30 lunch is served. Members we need to attend to a piece of business just for a minute.
