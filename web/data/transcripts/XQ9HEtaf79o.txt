TRANSCRIPT
----------
We're going to get deeper insight into what to expect during this 2026 legislative session
from two leaders in the Senate. Here in the studio is the newly elected Senate President
Proto-Town, Republican Senator Larry Walker, the third of Perry. He has served in the Senate
since 2015 and is former chair of the Insurance and Labor Committee. So we're so glad he's here
also joining us is the Senate Minority Leader, Democratic Senator Harold Jones, the second
of Augusta. He's been in the Senate since 2014 and his committees include Judiciary.
Welcome to lawmakers, both of you, with your end of your names. The second, third.
Okay, all righty. Pro-Tim Walker, you led the Senate Caucus press conference today,
and the caucus calls for a focus that is says, re-ignite the American dream. You broke down
priorities into three areas, the cost of living, quality of life, and the next generation.
So let's start with cost of living, which looks at taxes.
Tell us a little bit about that.
Sure, Donna.
So everywhere we, all the constituents we hear from,
whether it's Blue Ridge, down to Bainbridge,
they're straining under the rising cost of living.
And we hear that, and we're going to focus on that.
It's cost of housing, cost of groceries, cost of childcare.
In the American dream, this is the 250th anniversary
of America and Georgia.
And sadly, the American dream seems
out of reach for too many people.
And so our focus is going to be on affordability.
Yeah, so I know one of them has to do
with the state income tax rate.
You mentioned that.
And then it says stop skyrocketing local property tax bills
by capping home valuations.
So I have the press, have your little flyer here.
Tell us about that.
So under Lieutenant Governor Jones' leadership,
we had a study committee over the interim
to look at our income tax situation.
And we have a plan to eliminate state income tax
on the first 50,000 of earnings for a single filer
or 100,000 for a married filing jointly.
So that will eliminate the state income tax
on two thirds of Georgians.
And we're very excited about that.
We also hear from our constituents on a regular basis
that they're skyrocketing property tax.
And we've already dropped a bill to address that,
which would be a floating homestead exemption
that would limit the increase on property tax
to the rate of, on your home, to the rate of inflation.
Okay, thank you.
Any comment on any of that?
I know you, the income tax, you've spoken out about that.
He's spoken out about the income tax,
but I think one of the things is affordability, of course,
is the buzzword of the year.
And one of the ways we're going to be attacking
that particular issue is through Medicaid expansion,
and also actually having tax credits
when people actually bring their premiums down
as far as the health insurance is concerned,
because that is a major crisis within Georgia,
health insurance.
And so number one, we'd have Medicaid expansion,
which can actually help get more people insured,
and over a million Georgians right now,
we're depending on those federal tax credits.
So at some states have done,
even before what's recently happened
is they created their own tax credits
so their people could actually afford
those premiums or deductibles.
And so what we've been proposing
we actually started it last year with SB192
and it will continue this year
to actually have our own tax credits
to address that particular issue.
So when we talk about affordability,
the question really becomes
what issues are you looking at?
And then secondly,
how do you actually make those things affordable?
The thing is you're both talking affordability.
That's the main thing.
I want to focus on you for a little bit
because I want to make sure we get,
You spoke at the press conference today about ICE and Democrats present three bills.
You have one that is SB 390 and it is to put limits on the National Guard.
Tell us about it.
Right.
What it basically says is out of a state on National Guard cannot come in unless it has
a permission of the governor.
And so other states have actually done this to South Carolina being one, Kansas being
another Washington, just to actually pass a similar law.
So it's not anything particularly unusual.
So what the press conference was day about was the one we were focusing on, I think we
saw that.
But then secondly, it's actually a larger issue.
And that issue is the fact that a lot of people are actually concerned and scared about
the overreach that this administration is doing.
And quite frankly, after the last event that we had in Minnesota, it almost seems like
death was actually normalized to some extent by this president, the way the callus where
they kind of looked at what it had taken place.
And so people are nervous and they're scared about what's going on and we wanted to address
those particular issues.
Okay.
I didn't know whether you want to comment on that or we can move on to quality of life.
Let's talk about quality.
God tell us what the quality of life, what you're talking about in terms of that.
Well we know we have to have safe communities and so we're going to continue to invest in
safe communities.
We also know that part of your quality of life is having opportunities to enjoy the
The Great Outdoors, George is a beautiful state and we're going to look at ways to further
protect lands.
Our state is growing because we've had strong leadership and our economy is attracting
a lot of industry and a lot of manufacturing which we're proud of, but we want to make
sure we do protect opportunities to protect lands and let people enjoy the Great Outdoors.
I was real proud to have carried, sponsored,
and carried the George Outdoor Stewardship Act
several years ago under Governor Deal.
And I hope we can maybe expand that.
And that's where a portion of the sales tax revenue
on outdoor recreation equipment goes to a acquiring land
to protect for the public use.
Okay.
Anything else you want to mention
in terms of democratic priorities in your caucus?
Absolutely, another issue you're gonna be housing,
which was also mentioned,
but the way you actually approach it is gonna be key.
So some of those issues you can deal with
from kind of like a regulatory level, such as zoning,
but also you wanna look at the fact
that private equity judges one of the worst offenders
as far as private equity buying so many homes.
Here's the problem with that.
What happens is they're not buying those homes
for people to live in as a home.
They're buying those homes that actually jack up
the rent store to speak,
and that becomes problematic.
And so we actually gonna have a bill to talk about
trying to limit private equity
buying up all of these homes in Georgia.
And as I said, in Atlanta,
actually is a victim of this quite frankly,
and other parts of Georgia are too.
So number one, we'll look at regulatory features,
and then number two, we'll look at private equity
to try to get people into their homes.
Okay, let's get to your next generation,
because part of it deals with something
we're gonna talk about later,
and that's protecting children when it comes to AI.
But you're really focusing on things
when it comes to schools and those kinds of things.
Yeah, so AI certainly has a lot of benefits to it.
We just want to make sure they're guardrails around it.
So that, for example, you don't want AI to be
imitating a child and be on social media
that would damage that child.
There just needs to be guardrails around it.
And I'm sure your next guest will know a lot more about it
than I do.
But it's an interesting topic, but it is a little,
As you said in the intro, a little scary to me
in my generation anyway.
Yeah, so you also absenteeism, you guys looked at
and literacy rates, so those are two things
you're gonna look at.
Yeah, we have a chronic absenteeism problem
and we're gonna address that this year.
I will say that I do agree with the leader,
minority leader on the private equity,
buying up and driving up the cost of housing.
That's something I think we can work together on
And I look forward to that.
Absolutely.
So one of the things I wanted to ask before you go is what we're hearing is that you,
from both sides, as you guys are agreeing on a lot, do you agree that that's true?
We're agreeing on a lot.
We just have to see the details.
Okay.
That's always going to be the key.
But I think one of the good things is that Senate approach and walker myself, I should
have great relationships.
So I think that would add to the possibility of getting things done.
So you agree that we may not see things as contentious as we see in this?
I hope we're going to just focus on putting Georgians first and look focus on kitchen table
issues that really matter not get caught up in all the political grandstanding this is
an election year and all the political posturing I think I hope we can keep the main thing
the main thing.
Okay.
Well I want to thank you both for coming on the show and maybe we'll have you on a little
bit later.
Thank you.
Alrighty.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
