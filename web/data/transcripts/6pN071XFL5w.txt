----------
You
We're going to need to call it order now.
Yeah, come with my order.
Yeah.
All right, we are, I don't know about the local law enforcement, that's it, I don't
If I bring it to the floor, you're going to throw it against the farm, I'm done with you.
You ain't going to try.
I know, man.
I'll be up.
Yeah.
We'll just go test them.
Yeah.
All right.
You all ready?
We're back.
Yeah.
We'll be back in court.
If anybody hadn't figured out, Russ Goodman is pretty passionate about farmers, so if
you hear anything, it's not, I am a farmer, 200 years.
All right, let's get this thing started.
We've talked, and the Senate talks amongst themselves, and we have had some discussion.
One of the things that we want to propose is that the radius be 120 miles.
something uh where we said 120 I don't want you order and state I don't want you
order and stakes for me you gonna get the smallest one the lean that's right
two-year sunset is what the Senate proposed the point of contention that we
We have, and James, the local law enforcement is something that a lot of people have, a lot
of heartburn with.
Yes.
What's your position on that?
Well, personally, now, we're a little bit of a split of opinion.
I wish it wasn't in there.
That's me.
That's my personal opinion.
But I'm also trying to give something
that's a lifeline to...
We've got to compromise on that.
I'm trying to give a lifeline to some folks.
Especially, y'all, this is different since COVID.
We're looking at $4.50 diesel and everything else.
Yeah, we need to move on.
So do you have anything you want to add, representative meets?
Yes, I'm sorry, but representative Bush it please so you want to keep it in there. Do you want to do you want to amend it in any sort of way?
Well
Senator Gooch has proposed making it where the law enforcement is in there, but it sunsets with the laws
So after two years the local law enforcement goes away, and if we can't come up with some kind of compromise in two years that the
basically the entire turn that you don't mind turn that might come yes basically the
two-year sunset would be for the entire piece of legislation applicable to
the I like that provision what do you think what do you say this what do you say
this senator Gucci what if we say we leave the local enforcement in there but
we ask that any penalties or fees be they would go to the state not to the
It's already under current law that way.
We do have an amendment that we had for the bill earlier
that would direct it to the locals,
but that never got added to the bill.
So as written, all the funds will go to the state treasury.
So if the locals were to enforce
then all the money would go to the state.
Yes, no fees going anywhere else.
Yes, but in the future I would suggest we reconsider that
and direct those funds to the jurisdiction
of which the fines are written just like if a state
I am concerned about policing for profits with that on the work of men.
And I can say that today it would go to the state treasury.
But just know that if a state trooper pulls you over in your county chairman, the fines
go to the local county or city where the ticket is written.
You understand that.
It doesn't go to the state.
If a state trooper pulls you over on your way home tonight to Forsyth County, yes,
we're speeding ticket.
find revenue goes to that county or that city where that ticket is written, it does not
come to the state. State police are writing tickets at state expense, but the revenue
goes to the local governments. A lot of people don't know that. But as this bill is written,
that fine revenue would come back to the state treasury. So there would not be an incentive
to set up speed traps for local revenues, which adds a bill is written today.
There's a lot of consternation amongst folks about that.
Well, this protects your concern on that.
I want to recognize Representative Meek's sister's bill.
Representative Meek's, I think you should have more to say than anybody about it.
Well, the 120 miles, the reason we'd recommend a hundred feet to keep it consistent with F-MAP,
among the commodities, which is the federal program that allows you to drive within 150 mile radius of your farm.
I don't know why we would go anything short of that.
We were looking at it three years instead of two, and again we can negotiate that.
But the limiting local law enforcement I think is important.
I get everybody's position if we're going to sunset this in two years to take a look at it,
then, you know, that's what we're going to do in, you know,
regardless.
So, you know, Mr. Chairman, however you want to proceed from there,
we did look at adding a provision that we had talked about amongst ourselves,
at least on the house side that would include those that are hauling agriculture
finished goods for distribution or for retail consumption.
It was in a previous version of a bill that we had drafted.
We'll put it out there for consideration as well.
The other thing that we eliminated from the 10% variance
was solid waste.
I know that was important.
So we eliminated that from the 10% variance.
So we would stay at the 5% variance, 84,000.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Chairman Jasper's number five.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I concur with the Chairman Meeks on Love Law Enforcement.
I'd like to see them eliminated.
they just letting MCG do that.
You know, did look at locking in the attainment area
to the current date with the bill signed,
just on the, you know, we talked to,
let's say, council to do that.
It looked very carefully at the current bill
to make sure none of the fines are stackable
and that was very important.
And it was correct, they're not stackable.
They're not stackable.
Chairman, I'm with them on the local law enforcement. I would love to reach a deal here.
And one of the concerns that the Chairman brought here, Chairman Dolezal, was that then
you have someone that's not fully trained to perform these way in there on the side
the road. I mean for the fact that that the locals have, you know, they've been asked
to do this and I think it would just we even had the sheriff's association said that they
were not keen about it. Can I respond to both of those comments? Please. Terry Norris is
in this building every day that we're in this building. He is neutral on that bill.
he's not supporting it or opposing it.
He did say, and I asked him to verify this,
he said that DPS does 24 weeks of training,
which includes weights and inspections.
They have no training for weights only,
just like trip or school.
There is a lot of added to the minimum.
Apparently it takes 40 hours to train the deputies
on the weight side.
And so if the local governments want to do
local law enforcement, they have to certify
these police officers or these deputies in order to be able to write those tickets through
this state required training. It's not something they're going to give
Marty five as we heard earlier. They have to be certified. They have to have
the equipment. There's a possibility that hardly any of these cities or counties
will do this in the next two years, but give them the opportunity to do that as
an option, not a mandate. I think it's the right thing to do. Otherwise, you're
You're looking into the camera and you're saying we don't want to enforce the law that
we're going to sit here tonight.
I don't know how you can go home and justify that to people.
If people are killed in truck wrecks, and they come down here and testify next year that
their daughter or certain sons got killed, and your response is we didn't want local
law enforcement to be enforcing overweight trucks.
That's going to be hard for us to be able to face those people and explain how we came
across that decision.
So I think we leave it in for an option for the locals to do it.
There may not be any that chews to for two years, after two years, we'll have a new bill.
We'll have a new comprehensive freight logistics plan, Chairman Jasper's, that will include
weights for all industries, not just ag and timber.
So I think it's a good compromise.
We met you guys in the middle and I think it's a fair compromise we should accept and
go get this printed tonight.
What do you think about, instead of the locals doing it, how do we beef up?
MCC, the motor care group, how can we do that until next year and propose a new budget
which kills another 12 months?
Nobody is in here saying that we don't want to enforce a law Senator Gooch it's a
where you're you're expanding the enforcement to local to local law enforcement when
we have a motor care group for just this specific purpose and so I would say
I would be in favor of somehow increasing that staff or we just pass a budget.
I know.
For which you didn't include.
We just pass a budget.
For which the Senate did include a pay raise for MCCD.
House did.
I understand it's not in the final budget.
Because our balance, our budget at the balance.
It lasts a two.
Here we go.
Guys, look, how do you stand here and say we don't want to enforce the laws that you're
agreeing to adopt?
You're afraid of either facing the reality or you're afraid that some copy is going
to go out there and start harassing truck drivers. Do you think your sheriff and your county commissioners
are going to be allowing that for very long.
You and I will all hear from it next year,
and we'll be back in here changing the law,
and we'll take this power away from it,
just like we can authorize them to give it tonight.
It's my understanding, Mr. Leader,
that that's been done over history,
and it didn't work so well, and it was changed.
And we've given one more chance to prove the throng.
Mr. Chair, we have a couple of those
that we reconvene in 20 minutes.
Is that going to give us some extra time?
We're running out of time.
Well, Mr. Later, it seems there's Senator Dulles, I wish your failings on the in order
to make in terms of the legal law enforcement.
I think that if you're concerned with policing for profit and the money goes to the state
I think that I'd keep coming back to what I said earlier and I think that the leader
just said it as well.
The law enforcement piece very much feels like we know we're under 95, 80% of the time
and we just don't want to have to be accountable for it.
And whether that's, we look at that from a safety perspective, a road degradation perspective,
I don't know how you pass a law and say don't enforce it and Chairman, maybe you have
information that I don't have but if there's one person running around this state on a
weekend and forcing we essentially have zero enforcement and so I don't I have
it I have a hard time accepting that as a solution a compromise to put this
out there could be the local law enforcement has one year where everything
else has two years and then that forces our hand on the budget next year I
haven't discussed that with anybody else but that's a thought that I have of
how you split the baby but I think that it's I think the hand of the industry is
being exposed when the industry fights against enforcement. At every angle, whether that's
reporting at the mill, whether that's being able to, you're essentially telling light
sheriff that if he sees a truck that is grossly overloaded, he can't do anything.
Well, what if we allow, in the bill, it allows for them to see it, if they see a truck
that's grossly overweight, they hold them. They say, hold fast, we'll get MCC here.
Chairman where do you live? I live in Millwood. How long would it take to get from
Millwood to Delininger? Six hours. You've made the trip this past year. You
want your truckers to be sitting on the side of the road for six hours for that
one inspector on that Saturday afternoon? I don't think that's practical.
Well but is it can we have the conversation with MCCD on that topic and see you
know is that the norm or is it not I don't know if it is it may not be that may
not and it may be it may not be a fair characterization they just came off
of a long weekend working the the I know there was a bunch of over in
Savannah St. Patrick's Day parade yeah they set up right outside of mills down
down south so they're catching the folks coming we see them frequently in my
part we see them all the time because you look at us one and when his
district and they're parked outside of the pellet mill it makes you made the
point earlier they're not enforcing them on back roads they're on four lane
highways. These two lane roads and counties and cities are their concern for the local
government. So we know they're not they don't have the resources to do it. Today we can't
give them the resources until next year at the earliest. But you want to hold the bill
hostage so you can get some resources whenever we knew this was coming. We want to make
the right policy so we can move this bill forward. I believe it's the right thing to do.
We're asking people to enforce the laws and then honor the laws. How can that be the
We're working under this assumption that the MCCD is not doing that, doing that.
But you're saying the MCCD is not capable of doing their job.
Sir, you are totally misrepresenting what I said.
Well, we're saying we're all agreeing that they don't have the resources to cover
110,000 miles of roads in the state.
So we have 100,000 miles of roads in the state.
They're covering the interstates, they're covering the state routes of four lanes.
They are not covering these local county roads.
but I don't mean to misrepresent what you're saying,
but where I see MCCD is on my local roads,
not on my state roads, I see them right there on,
well, I see them on 82, I see them on the bypass,
I see them in the US one, I see them on the state routes,
which are the routes where the meals are back home.
I don't know of the meals that are just off of,
off of like county districts.
I'm just gonna add this and I'm gonna go home,
and I'll be back as soon as this votes over.
Leader Grooch is committed to,
Because I will remind you guys the posture that I believe
that worry, which is that I don't know that you,
I think you lose senators when you radically change this bill.
The leader has committed to Russ that with what he's
proposed, he will speak in favor of the bill
and will work the caucus for it.
I believe your position is also the inverse if I would think
that let's take 10, 15 minutes, talk to you that reconvene.
What do you want to, can't we meet back here in 10 minutes?
I'll be back here as soon as this vote's done.
Can we get some clarity language in there to assure that those fees are going to the state?
You can ask Jenna Dole, she has already emailed me that, and I started to prepare the amendment.
That was a week or two ago.
So the bill hasn't changed, and it didn't change before it went to the floor.
So the way it passes in it, the revenues go to the state's treasury, but she can confirm that for me.
Okay, thank you, Ms.
We're going to stand to these 15 minutes.
You
