----------
you you you you you you you you you you you George you you you we and you we all of you to have and to use as you see fit. So please be seated. We will begin our day. Today was scripture reading in prayer by the Chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our Chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 138th House District Representative Mike Chokus. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, it's an honor and a privilege for me to introduce Pastor Bud Womack. But before I get started, he's accompanied today by his beautiful wife, Ms. Fay. And one of his two daughters is lovely daughter, Kelsey, and she's an educator. We'll be an educator. So if you two will stand up, we'd like to welcome you to Georgia's People's House. I met Reverend Bud several years ago. We did a road dedication for fallen hero in my part of the country. Victor Anderson, and we named a section of Highway 19 between America and Eleville in his memory. And Victor served not only courageously with the United States Army, but he also served in both Sheriff's Department, the Sheriff's Department in Sly County and in Sumter County. And I got to meet Bud and we talked and instantly we became friends. He serves as the chaplain, not only for the subject County Sheriff's Department, but also for the State Patrol. And he has to deal with some of the emotional issues and spiritual issues that are fine men and women in law enforcement are faced with on a daily basis. And I guess that's what prepared him for me. Anyway, we became great friends and have had him here last year. And not only is he a man of God, but he's also a man of the people. Last night we had dinner together and for an hour and a half nonstop, we kept talking and talking and talking and catching up and enjoying it. And I know you'll be inspired by today's message. So let me introduce you to my very close friend, Reverend Bud Womack. I just want to point out that we did spend an hour and a half at the restaurant, but Mike done most of the talking. I know you may have a hard time believing that. I do want to thank you, Mike, for inviting me back again. I hope that last time I was here almost a year ago today, I talked to you about living in a blessed field and I hope in the past 12 months you found yourself living in a blessed field. I want to thank you Speaker Ralston for letting me be here and also all of you for what you do in the state of Georgia and how you conduct business and make a change in who we are as a state. I want to start out by telling you a joke about a preacher. Young preacher first started out preaching. He got his first revival, 250 people in attendance. Little old lady walked up to him after church and said, son, you just something else. He smiled real big, shook her hand, hugged her neck, walked away. The next night he came back, there was only 150 people there. Same little old lady walked up to him, smiled at him real big and said, son, you something else. The next night, 50 people showed up for the revival and the young preacher was so depressed and let down. Done the best he could preaching after church. Same little old lady walked up to him and she said, son, you just something else. He said, wait a minute, man, you've told me that for three nights. We've dropped 100 people in attendance every night since then. Why do you keep saying that? She said because you ain't a preacher, you something else. You need to figure it out. I don't know if that fits me or not, but whatever it does, it does. I want to talk to you on this thought this morning just briefly that the backside may be the best side. Roman's 8 and 37 says and all these things were more than conquerors through him who loved us. I want to tell you about a man that I know. He was raised in a poor home that at best they barely got by. On the rare occasion that the family was allowed to go out and possibly treat themselves to a burger, they were allowed, he and his siblings to order a hamburger, but the family literally could not afford cheese. He knew what it was to have hand me downs. If you look around now, we pay good money for tore up pants. We didn't do that when I was growing up. That would have been a large embarrassment. So, but this guy knew what hand me downs were. School the other kids would get extra things. They could buy an extra milk, possibly even ice cream on ice cream day. This young man was often left out of that equation. Lafdeck because of his clothes, looked down on because of where he came from. At the age of 16, he moved to a new town. His family moved away and he started high school in that other town. A new beginning, but with the same clouded mind and wounded heart. Nothing seemed to work in his favor. So, we chose the wrong path. He began to experiment with drugs. He discovered the numbing effects of alcohol. He and his dad couldn't get along and so a quick stop by the local liquor store and a little drink to have the numbing effect. So, he could deal with the inevitable fighting and arguing that would ensue as soon as he got home with his dad. One day, he was invited to go to church. He was told about Jesus and he accepted Jesus Christ as a savior and boy it changed his life. He felt so much better. It's the first time he'd ever felt totally and 100% accepted. Graduated high school, met a young girl, a man he fell head over heels and love with her. After dating for nearly three years, they got married. About six years later, when they found out their first child was going to be born, all hell broke loose in his life. Everything he touched broke down. He just couldn't get anything right. Whatever he touched seemed to fall apart. Everywhere he turned, there was another attack. Somebody else saying something or doing something to bring him down. He found himself with the same feelings he had when he was a kid. Just not good enough. Rejected. Looked down on him and also talked about. One day, church for him really happened. There was an empty seat in front of him. When he sat down, he thought, well, I'll just dredge through another chance of going to church. It probably isn't going to work. Set right down in front of him was this man about six foot eight, probably 350 pounds. He sat there disgusted and aggravated and reluctantly, he stayed in church that day. He couldn't tell you what the preacher said. He couldn't tell you what songs were sung. With some 800 people in attendance that day, he got up from his seat and decided when the altar call was given, he'd give it one more shot because he even felt rejected by God. He went down to the altar, nearly a hundred people in that altar. He knelt down and this was what he prayed. God, if you still love me, let somebody come by and pray for me. I just need a touch. Nobody out of a hundred people in that altar even walked by and bumped his foot as he knelt still feeling rejected and let down. He got up to go back to his seat. Just before he got back to his seat, that big old tall, wide man that blocked just total view during church stepped out of the aisle, held his arms out and said, come here son, that young man fell into the chest of that big old guy and just whipped. This is what he said to him. He said, son, the arms you feel right now are not the arms of a man, but they're the arms of your heavenly Father and he wants you to know he still loves you. My friend, that changed his life forever. Now, you may ask, how do you know so much about this young man? It's simple, that young man was me. I lived that life. Here's what I want you to hear today, just because somebody else has made up in their mind that you're nothing. It doesn't mean God has made up his mind. He loves you unconditionally. Takes you just like you are and promises never to leave you that way. Isaiah 54 and 17 says this, no weapon formed against you will ever prosper. Now, want you to notice, it doesn't say that there won't be a weapon formed. It doesn't say that there won't be difficult times. It doesn't say we won't face hardships. It just says that they won't prosper. And I think that's good news. I want to close with this thought. I always thought I couldn't. I always thought I never would or never could until I found out I could as long as I've got him. And I'm remembering that he loves me. Philippians 4 and 13, I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength. So the backside, what we see is the backside, very well may be the best side. It's determined by what we choose to do with our life. Will you pray with me? Kind and gracious, Heavenly Father. Will it take a personal moment just to thank you for reminding me that you love me? Thank you, Lord, for every step that I took in life. God, today, there are representatives from all over the state of Georgia, leadership of this state. They need to be reminded that you love them. God, that you can guide their hands. You can guide their voice. God, every time they vote on legislation, I pray, God, that you would deliver it into their hearts that you love them. I pray, Lord, for strength in their lives, blessings on their homes, enjoyment in their job as a representative. I ask you God to walk with them. Bless this chamber in its leadership. We ask you God to bless the state of Georgia. And God, we ask you to continue to bless the United States of America. It's in the lovely and precious name of Jesus Christ that we pray. Amen. Amen. Plans you, Legion, to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Doorkeepers will unlock the doors. Chair recognizes Chairman Hogan, the chair of the Committee on Information and Audits. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Today is World Hearing Day at the Capitol. 466 million people worldwide have disabled hearing loss. 34 million of whom are children.

She has no idea I'm about to do this, but I'd like for my mother to please stand to be recognized. She's in the gallery. My mother, Vicki, has been deaf since early childhood. Technology is nothing like it, like it is today. She made her way through school and physical therapy school and became a well-accomplished physical therapist. The moment I'll never forget was 15 years ago. We were all sitting around the kitchen table, and she kept hearing this noise. This was right after she got her first cochlear implant. We all wonder what is she hearing, and she said, what is that noise? What is that noise? It was the first time in her life she had heard a bird chirp. That was the moment our whole family will never forget. So I'm extremely proud of my mom and she's an amazing woman. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you. Chair recognizes Chairman Hawkins for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I have the honor and privilege of recognizing the North Hall wrestling team who won their first triple-A state wrestling tournament last Saturday.

Coach David Nichols has been coaching for two years at North Hall, along with assistant coach Pat Hokem, who has been with the group for 20 years as a player and now a coach. And also a retired coach has come back, Coach White, who was coaching there when my kids were going to North Hall and is well known in the wrestling world in this state for taking kids to state tournaments over the many years. Coach Nichols and assistant coaches, not only coach wrestling, but also coach values of life. And these lessons in life go far for the rest of their lives. If you would stand and be recognized in the house, the house could recognize you there up there on the right hand side. Coach Nichols, wrestling team from North Hall. Thank you. Chair recognizes representative Holland for a morning order. I'm advised that we have three minutes left for morning orders. We have about 12 members left. Thank you. Somebody's going to get carried over. You know I can talk fast. In the heart of Buckhead in beautiful house district 54, there's a complex called Cathedral Towers that provides affordable housing and a safe environment that really emphasizes a strong sense of community. A civically engaged group of people from Cathedral Towers have come today to the Capitol to meet with their legislators and observe our democratic process. I want to recognize that group of Cathedral Towers residents who are joining us today. Thank you. Chair recognizes chairman Benton for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I want to call your attention to today being the 240th anniversary of the Revolutionary War Battle of Breyer Creek. It was a what we refer to in military terms, a major disaster for the American Army after having won the Battle of Kettle Creek several weeks previous. Want to point out that this was a battle in which the Americans actually had the upper hand and men, but were surprised in their attack. Later General William Motre who was from South Carolina proclaimed that Breyer Creek was so disastrous that it extended the war for another 12 months. And the governor's office today there is a print one-gallant stand depicting this battle. I would recommend you go by and take a look at it. It's quite nice. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes representative Larickia for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This morning we would like to recognize South Georgia State College, the president of South Georgia State College.

Thank you all so much for being here this morning. For the final 35 seconds of morning orders, this chair recognizes representative Scofield. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and House colleagues. I wanted to talk today about the significant value of natural hair textures and protective styles for women's history month. Culturally natural hair texture is a part of every person's DNA. Economically it stated that natural hair industry is $2.5 billion in industry. In the healthcare arena to know that chemical hair products lead to cancer and inflammatory diseases. Many people wear wigs, weaves, protective styles to protect and preserve the quality of life. While Georgia is known to be a great place to work, live and be educated. As this is women's history month, let's make Georgia an authentic and inclusive state by creating a... ...spirulastic. ...by creating a reciprocal and open world. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. That completes our time for morning orders today. If you want to be carried over to LaMaria, you need to see the messenger. House will remain at order. We have a rather lengthy rules calendar today, which is why the people sent us here. So I'm going to ask for your cooperation so that we can move through the invite resolutions in an expeditious manner. Get on to the rules calendar and handle our business because I sort of assume that some of our committees may meet today. Is that accurate? That's what I thought. Okay. Clerk will read the caption to House Resolution 1354. House Resolution 1354, my represent a Ballinger, the 23rd, a resolution recognizing and commending Victoria Hill, Ms. Georgia 2019, and for other purposes. Chair recognizes Chairman Cantrell for an invite resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I stand before you today to recognize when a Cherokee County is finest. Young lady, we're incredibly proud of Victoria Hill. Victoria was Missed Georgian last year. And she has with her today her mom Christine. Right here, let's welcome Christine, if you would. And then her two brothers and sisters in the gallery, Daniel Emily and Jonathan, grateful for them coming down today. Now Miss Victoria participated in the Miss America pageant last fall and she was first runner up. If you watch the pageant, as I did, you know that she got ripped off. She should have won. It was obvious to everybody from Georgia. So today happens to be the 89th anniversary of National Anthem Day, the day that our country adopted the National Anthem. So I'm going to ask Victoria to come, say a few brief words. She has been advocating for foster care. And then she's going to lead us in the National Anthem. Y'all welcome Miss Victoria Hill, Ms. Georgia. Thank you. Thank you. It is such an honor for me to be here. I am Miss Georgia Victoria Hill and I've been traveling across the state and many others advocating for the needs of children in the foster care system. And I've been involved in working in the foster care system long before I was involved with the Miss America organization. I currently work at a group home for teen girls. And I've been raising awareness of the needs in the foster care system, recruiting businesses and organizations to serve and creating mentorship programs across our state for youth aging out of the foster care program. Because I realize that when you work in the foster care program, you are helping reduce the numbers in the homeless population. You are reducing the numbers in prisons and you're helping people and generations and generations of success and resources and so much potential that is not currently being invested into. So I thank you for advocating for youth in the foster care system and for all that you all do. So please stand with me as I sing our National Anthem. Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming? Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight? Or the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming? And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air, give proof through the night that our flag was still there. Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave? Or the land of the free and the home of the brave? Clerk will read the caption to House Resolution 1113. House Resolution 1113, members, and I'm messing with the 50th expiry. Just a moment. This House will be at order. We still have other special guests to honor. Chair is going to ask that you take your seats and cease conversation. Gentlemen may proceed. House Resolution 1113, my represent, that's the 55th Myring, on 35th Williams, on 68th Thomas the 56th, Maiden, on 51st and others. A resolution recognizing and commending Barbara Pace Hunt, Myropane Elliott, and Iris May Welsh, and for other purposes. Chair recognizes representative Mitz for an invite resolution. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, for giving me this opportunity and trust me. Everybody is smiling. I have 30 seconds and I will live to that. I am so proud today to introduce Dr. Mari C. Daniels. Dr. Daniels researched and the book is called Ground Crew, and it's on your desk. So it'll tell you about the Ground Crew and also about Dr. Daniels. But a substantial written account of important historical information. And it tells us about three young ladies over 60 years ago who wanted to obtain a college degree. I now present Dr. Daniels. Thank you very much, Representative Mitz, to the Honorable Speaker and members of the House. I think I have one minute. Thank you for, thank this illustrious body for approving this resolution, recognizing Barbara Hunt, Myropane Elliott, and Iris May Welsh, and their lawyers for their contributions that set the stage for the desegregation of public colleges and universities in the state of Georgia. On December 10th, 1964, in his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said, every time I take a flight, I'm always mindful of the many people who make a successful journey possible. The known palettes and the unknown ground crew, we come today to celebrate this unknown ground crew who set the stage for the desegregation of public colleges and universities in the state of Georgia. Thank you very much. Mr. Speaker, and Mr. Speaker, I'd like to just briefly point out the daughters of one of the living legend. Here she is, the daughters, and they are also daughters up in the gallery. So we want to say thank you very much and welcome. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you. Good job. You can walk back for one minute. Yeah, I do understand they're doing a bad business. I'm sorry. Clerk, we'll read the caption to House Resolution 1293. House Resolution 1293 by President Bonner, the 72nd May the act, the 73rd Singleton, the 71st. Bays more of the 63rd Jackson, the 64th. A resolution commending the BOOM RUF, a licensed child welfare agency, and for other purposes. Chair recognizes Representative Bonner for an invite resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm joined by the members of the Fayette delegation this morning to recognize a great organization in Fayette County. BOOM is a private nonprofit foster care organization located in Fayetteville. They're celebrating their 30th anniversary. They recruit, support and train our foster families who give displaced children hope in a home life for the next phase of their lives. They believe as we do that every child deserves the chance to be the best person that they were meant to be. I'm joined today by board members, Norma Adams and Jack Middleton, a program director, Pam Talley, and their executive director, Becky Davenport, who's going to share a quick word. Good morning. It is such an honor to be here this morning. Thank you, Representative Bonner, and our illustrious speaker for this resolution to recognize our work for over 30 years of supporting and sheltering and strengthening the lives of foster children all across the state of Georgia. Last year at the Bloom closet, we served over 4,500 foster children from 90 Georgia counties. It has been quite a journey over the past 30 years, and we're just so excited to be sharing it here with you. Thank you so much.

Chair recognizes representative Wynn to introduce the doctor of the day. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I have the pleasure of introducing our doctor of the day, Dr. Stewart Seagerman. Dr. Stewart Seagerman attended medical school at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine and completed his residency at Emory. He has double board certified in emergency medicine and pediatrics and serves Georgia's people from young to old at St. Joseph's Hospital. He is a member of and has served on the board of Georgia College Emergency Physician since 1992. Welcome Dr. Stewart Seagerman. Good morning. Thank you for having me. I just want to say I'm available at the clinic or any other time. Anybody has questions about health care or anything else? As I told the Senate, I have opinions on everything. Thank you. We are going on to the rules calendar. Going on to the rules calendar, the clerk will read the caption to House Bill 829. House Bill 829, my resident of Stevens, the 64th and Harrell, the 166th to be titled an act to amend Code Section 485-7. The physical to Georgia annotated ruling the assessment of tangible property so as to provide for local referendum to authorize assessment of residential homesteaded property. This bill have referred to the committee on ways and means. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Stevens to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, today I bring you House Bill 829 and it does something historic. Every year we get bombarded with our local constituents asking us, pleading with us, begging with us to cut their school taxes. We do it. It is all across the board and we do that through a local bill. Sometimes it is good and it is odd to say the least. For the first time in Georgia's history, if you believe as I believe that this authority should lie within the school board, your local school system, if you will vote for this bill and the following resolution, if you become 65 years of age and you live in your home, you have one single homestead. The school board themselves will be allowed to offer by local referendum to tax you at one half the rate. Currently all property is taxed at 40% of your value. This bill, if they so choose not us, will be able to cut their taxes in half for senior citizens if they choose and if their budget allows it. Mr. Speaker, that is the essence of the bill and I will answer any questions if there are any. You do not appear to have any questions. Thank you. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of House Bill 829? Will vote aye, those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 829, the eyes are 157. The nays are six. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Resolution 962. House Resolution 962. By resident Stevens, the non-64th proposing amendments to the Constitution so as to authorize the general assembly to provide by general law for local referendum to authorize assessment of residential home-stated property. This resolution have been referred to the committee on ways and means. The committee recommends that this resolution be adopted by committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Stevens to present the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Every year we talk about local control, local control. Well, if you'll press your green button today, you'll give the authority of your local school system to have local control. I'll answer any questions if there are any. If not, I'll ask for your favorable support. Do not appear to have any questions. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this resolution now be adopted? All those in favor of the adoption of the resolution will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the adoption of House resolution 962. The eyes are 163. The nasor five. This resolution having been adopted by margin of more than two thirds is therefore adopted. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 888. House Bill 888 by Representative Hawkins of the 27th and others to be entitled to men. Title 33 of the official code of Georgia and its 80 related insurance so as to provide for certain consumer protections against surprise billing. This bill then refer to the committee, the special committee on quality health care. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Hawkins to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today to bring bill House Bill 888, the Surprise Billing Consumer Protection Act. You know, one of the most leading causes of bankruptcy in this state and this nation are unknown surprise medical bills. These occur typically when a patient selects an in-network provider going to an in-network facility but is later seen during that treatment by an out-of-network provider. Out-of-network provider means that you do not have contracts with an insurance company. They do not have payment arrangements. They may not be paid anything at all and the patient receives that surprise bill often being in the tens of thousands of dollars. This legislation addresses this problem and this body has addressed this problem for the last five years. This regulation begins by codifying certain terms like contracted amount as a medium-end network amount paid during the 2017 for a margin in non-emergent services. This will be adjusted annually by the COS which is the Commission of Insurance and will not include Medicaid and Medicare rates. Another definition of importance. Healthcare plans. These plans are qualified, high deductible plans, medical hospital plans, HMOs, managed care, subscriber contracts and the state health benefit plan. They do not include a recipe plans, CMO Medicaid plans, Medicare plans and any other plans not described in the section. This bill also defines the term surprise bill meaning a person that is covered and receives care from an out-of-network provider at an in-network facility. The bill is divided into sections and I will go through some of these briefly. The first section for is a margin care. This is when the provider or the facility is in network or out-of-network and they should be paid by the insurer without prior authorization or any retrospective payment denial for medically necessary services. The provider of the healthcare facility may only bill the patient that deductible, co-insurance or co-payments, co-insurance payments. The insurer will pay the greater amount of the verifiable contracted amount which I already mentioned. The most recent verifiable amount agreed to by a provider who was in network and is now out of network. Provider payments will be subject to the prompt pay laws of this state and insurers will notify the providers that this plan is an arrissa plan. The non-emergent section mirrors the emergent section with dealing with out-of-network providers. The next section is the patient freedom section and this is one I was particularly interested in. This is that a patient can go to any doctor anywhere in this state and where that doctor's in network or out-of-network is long as the patient understands that doctors out-of-network they may balance bill the patient. The patient can charge the patient beyond what the insurance company pays. This keeps the freedom of healthcare in the hands of the patient and is a very good way. I still think that medicine should be practiced. The second section is the care of the patient and the care of the patient. This section has an interest in being a dentist and that is if you go to an out-of-network provider and you have an emergency but a immediate care need like an abscess to. I can refer you to another provider in Ended Honest that day and not have pre-serts and all the other things that may occur if that provider is in network. So it clears up a lot of the end network and out-of-network obstacles for the patient. Now we have been working on this bill as you know for many, many years and some parts of this bill are very new compared to the last few years and some parts of this bill is different than the bill they passed on the Senate side. The conditions we have made is not include Medicaid and Medicare rates in the computation of the contracted amount that would reduce what our hospitals and what our physicians receive making it almost impossible for them to practice, especially in the rural areas. The additional change that we made is that if you go to an out-of-network hospital and often these are in our rural areas they may be in network with one insurance company but not another and you may be unlucky enough to be in the out-of-network category. The hospital for emergency care can also arbitrate the fee paid by the insurance company. That's very important because again on the rules of the arbitration those amounts are identified in place in code earlier in this section. Again we have been fighting or discussing this bill for five years and I want to recognize some folks and I'm going to begin with the folks that truly came to the plate for the very reason to protect patients and they are the insurers, the hospitals and the physicians. They actually agreed to this legislation but I also want to recognize some particular people that helped him work on this diligently for the last three months. I'm talking about on charities and Sundays, ride conversations will mean the folks I'm about to name. First I'd like to recognize Senator Chuck Kufstettler for all his work over the years. Ryan Locke with the governor's office, very intelligent young man who worked very hard arranging this legislation in a flowing manner. Regina Quick, one of our house members who has a brilliant legal mind and a compass all in line, Vincent Wigan and legislative counsel. I talked to Vincent every Saturday and Sunday I guess for the last two months and he did a wonderful job on this bill, wonderful patients. But the main person I want to mention today is Chairman Richard Smith. This bill came about because of him. This bill has been accomplished because of him and I'd like to personally thank him for this legislation. He's been a great friend to me and a great friend to all of you and a great friend of the patients of Georgia. And I hope that you all will vote for this bill. So when you go home you can look at your friends and your family and say we together saw this problem and you will no longer get a surprise bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker. There are no questions. I will resign the well. You've got a couple of questions if you care to you. Yes sir. I will. Chair recognizes representative Shannon to your right for a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Does the representative yield? I do. So I appreciate that in this bill you're dealing with the emergency room services where it clearly states that patients will not be balanced bill for that. But the question I have is around lines 254 through 257 where the bill also talks about how if a patient goes through a process where they end up having a provider that is out of network. Let's say for example if you get a colonoscopy and then the anesthesiologist that the hospital chooses or the doctor's office chooses is out of network. The patient would not be billed for more than what is their copay deductible which in some cases a deductible as you mentioned before with the high deductible plans could be like 7500. So on the one hand you're closing the door on people receiving really large bills like a hundred thousand dollars just being bill straight for whatever the anesthesiologist did but at the same time you're leaving the door open for people to get really high bills with you know being billed up to the total amount they're deductible. The question I have is around lines 254 through 257. The bill also says that if the provider decides that the deductible that they are going to bill the patient for is not enough for the work that was provided you could go into a situation of arbitration that could include the patient. Who pays the bill and this is a question sorry it took so long to get there but this is really important. Who pays the bill if a situation arises where the provider says hey the deductible amount is not enough the doctor needs to receive more payment for the work that he or she has done and so you go into a situation of arbitration whatever the result of that arbitration is who pays that amount. That arbitration is described in the arbitration piece later in this bill and that will be between the provider and the insurer and they will go through arbitration through the commissioner's office and it's baseball arbitration where one side puts in an amount the other side puts in an amount if they can agree within 30 days arbitrator steps in and one amounts chosen. Now you were early referring to section 9 section 9 was placed in the bill because of the out of network facility so it references through 30 20 e dash 4 that's the emergency section so for emergencies if you go to an out of network hospital you can go through arbitration for non emergencies you cannot do that. Typically when you go to a in network facility you have the ability to ask that provider is anyone else involved with this procedure so we cannot as far as providers you still you know will be covered they cannot bounce bill you for those behind them but the facility can and in network facility is in contract so they can bill you. And we cannot include in network facilities believe me that thought crossed my mind but that was enough to topple the whole bill. Does it represent a view for an additional question sure but again back on lines 254 through 257 it says that a patient could be involved in that arbitration I just don't see anything in the bill that says that whatever the result of the arbitration comes out of it the bill is not going to go back to that patient. No what that section speaking to is that the providers ability to request arbitration not the patient for a single patient in which they're going to ask for arbitration for single patient single procedure multiple patients is describing what the provider can ask arbitration for in none of those cases is the patient liable for any of this this is only between the provider and the insurer well then why does line 254 say that a patient may be in the middle of the bill. And I think that a patient may be involved I guess what I'm concerned about is that we're closing the door on surprise bills on one side but it feels like we're opening it on another side because you're saying that the patient could be dragged into arbitration if the doctor if the provider feels that they're not getting enough payment for their services and there's nothing in the bill that says the patient can't then receive that that bill which is the result of arbitration in addition to the fact that you've added that patients could be billed up to the amount of their deductible which for some people is $7,500. It's more is less than a hundred but it's also still enough to bankrupt somebody. I understand your question and the confusion is coming in you're in the section of arbitration this is before between the provider and the insurer that the word that you're referring to is only those cases that the provider is in arbitration with the insurer. Nor is the provider can can go into arbitration with one patient's you know challenging one patient's payment what they paid the insurance paid insurer paid for that patient for one procedure for multiple procedures multiple patients for multiple procedures. That's just delineating what the provider can bring arbitration that is to avoid arbitration for the same patient same procedure or multiple patients for the same procedure. And you end up with 200 arbitrations they're involving only a few codes this does not create a problem for the patient. So just one final question if I may. I understand what you're saying is that the lines 254 through 57 are talking about the events or their currencies of what may have happened with one patient so one patient situation. But what I'm asking is there's arbitration that's referenced a lot in this bill and it's a pretty long bill. Nowhere in the bill does it say that the results of any of these arbitrations would not go back to that individual patient. No it is referenced later in the bill the arbitration only between the insurer and the physician and it says later in the arbitration that when the arbitrator makes that decision lose her pays that is the insurer or the provider the patient's been taken out of this whole arbitration that they're not involved in the arbitration. Can you just tell me where in the bill it says that what lines. Well it says it multiple times but at the very end of the bill it says. Because I see where the loser pays I just don't see where there's a guard against that bill going back to the to the patient that's what I don't see. And it says again you know one other reference to it's on 342 once request for arbitration has been filed with the insurance commission by provider or you tilt or facility under this chapter. Needless such provider or facility nor the insurer in such a dispute will file a lawsuit in the court regarding the out of network claim over and over again it talks about the provider and the insurer. And it never goes back to the patient the arbitration. Yes but and I thank you for pointing out those lines I'm just saying that it doesn't say that that bill can't go back to the patient and I'm looking at what you just read but that doesn't say anything about who could be responsible for the final bill. Well I don't know way to put it to apologize but in many places in this it says that the arbitration is between the provider and the insurance and is regulated on the insurance commission of insurance and arbitration. Thank you I appreciate it. Do you further yield? Yes. Maybe one more time it's okay. I'm going to let you think on that for about five or 10 seconds. Okay then I'll sit down and let's vote. How's that? Sounds like a voluntary decision on your part. Gentlemen has yielded the well is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's none the previous question is ordered is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here's none the committee substitute is adopted is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill the chair here's none? The report of the committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of House bill eight eight eight will vote aye those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does repper chairman darling Taylor rise? Thank you Mr. Speaker though I really like this bill I feel like subject to the House will 133 I must ask to be excused lady has that right and the journal will so reflect. Have all members voted have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House bill eight eighty eight the eyes are one hundred and sixty four the nays are four this bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is there for past. Clerk agreed the caption to House bill seven eighty nine. House bill seventy nine whatever I said Newton of the hundred twenty third and others to be in title of act to men chapter twenty C in title thirty three the fish go to Georgia and it had. Relating accurate provider directories so survived for the creation of a surprise bill rating system based upon the number of certain physician specialty groups. This bill that refer to the committee the special committee on quality health care that committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes chairman Newton to present the bill. Mr. Speaker colleagues this is a continuing national conversation on surprise medical bills trying to prevent our citizens and our constituents from receiving those by definition the surprise medical bill is a surprise because someone often has picked an insurance plan because it covers the hospital that they are their family want it would like to use or maybe if you're if someone's purchasing for a group of employees for a company they pick one that their employees want to be able to use. The surprise when someone say with appendicitis goes to one of this this in network hospital with an in network surgeon and then a few weeks later after successful surgery finds themselves receiving an out of network ER bill or an out of network radiology bill for the CT scan that diagnosed them the out of network anesthesia bill for the person who. They're not going to put them to sleep but more importantly woke them up what what we're trying to prevent is the largest sources of surprise medical bills currently come from four specialties in our hospitals those are the ones where you can't look up our names you can't find out who's the pathologist that looks at that specimen after surgery or who's the anesthesiologist that's going to put you to sleep you don't get to pick them and you can't look up their name. They're not just employers and people who are trying to purchase an insurance plan at a disadvantage because when they purchased it they may be found their primary care doctor in the network but they and they found the hospital that they are their family would like to go to was in that insurance plans network but unbeknownst to them they didn't know the status of those four important specialties that are in a hospital and crucial to the care that's anesthesia emergency medicine pathology and radiology and so then they find themselves weeks after surgery receiving a surprise bill. And if any of you have chosen one of the HMO plans that we have ourselves if you chose one of the HMO plans and you look carefully out of network bills are covered at 0% the other plans are covered at 60 instead of 80% so you could be responsible for the entire out of network bill for any of those one two three or four of those providers and find yourself on the hook for thousands of dollars that you had no way and neither did your employer if they pick that plan for you that included that hospital. They had no way to tell that those four specialties were or were not in network what the surprise bill transp-

The Emergency Act does, House Bill 789, is it puts in place where the insurance department currently requires the insurance plans to list on their website, the hospital, the hospital name, the location, the telephone number, and any accreditation, it adds one thing called a surprise bill rating for this insurance plan in that hospital. That just means it's either four green checks or four red X's that would mean that all those four specialties that are hospital based that you can't pick your provider, that they're either all in network under this health plan at that hospital, or if there's four red X's, I'm sorry, four red X's, it would mean that none of those specialties were in network at your in network hospital. Basically, you're getting the building but none of the doctors that work in it. Obviously, there could be a combination of three and one or two and two, and that has to be explained. So this is a simple thing that adds to the current regulations that have to be updated every 30 days according to the current Department of Insurance. It adds a surprise bill rating, whenever you look up your insurance plan, you find a hospital in network, you can look and see whether those specialties are in there. But more importantly, when you're picking an insurance plan, and we get the blessing of being able to choose from several different insurers in our state health benefits plan, but so do a lot of other people, and frankly a lot of HR individuals at large corporations. They have the luxury of choosing who will cover their Arissa plan, which are the federally regulated plans that we can't control. We can control the 13 to 15% that Chairman Hawkins was talking about that are Georgians who have insurance plans that are controlled by the Department of Insurance here in Georgia. But over 60% of Georgians of the ones who get their insurance through their employer, over 60% of them are an employer self insurance plan. It's covered under Arissa at a federal level, and we can't tell that insurance company who to pay or how much to pay or who to have in network or who not to. But what we can do is utilize the fact that the network is almost always the same in the fully insured plans, and in the Arissa plans, which are 60% of Georgians with employer insurance. So by utilizing that, by shining a light on it, by adding this surprise bill rating, when people are out there choosing plans, whether for a family of six like me or for six or 60,000 employees, they can look and see that when this plan says it has these hospitals in network, it tells them kind of the rest of the story. It also has these hospitals, but also the hospital-based physicians that are the source of most surprise bills. So that's where we're looking forward to moving. We're trying in Georgia to influence, to control the ones that we have control over through the Department of Insurance in House Bill 888. But what we're also trying to do is strongly influenced by a bright spotlight transparency on these insurance plans that either you or your employer paying over $14,000 a year on average for a family plan. So we have the opportunity in this state house between these two bills, and Chairman Smith and I have worked on this along with Chairman Hawkins and many others. We have a chance to go back to our constituents as Chairman Hawkins said, and say that we did everything we could with the ones under our control, but not only that, we took a further step and did something for the ones that can only be controlled from Washington. We don't want to wait around on Washington to solve this. So we're going to go on and do everything that Georgia can do. And I hope you'll support the Surprise Bill Transparency Act. I'd be glad to answer any questions, Mr. Speaker. You have a few. Yes, sir. Do you yield? I do. Chair recognizes the Chairman of the Industry and Labor Committee. Chairman Warkhizer, to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mark, appreciate all your hard work on this. Didn't one of the benefits to this bill, the fact that now some of these providers who are hesitant to work with doctors and insurance companies are now going to be even more willing and actually aggressively coming to the table because everybody is going to want to have a four-star rating. It is a four-green check rating. Stars was earlier, but it is four-green checks. And yes, that is a feature of the bill, really, is that everybody involved, the insurance company who have the finances and the patients and then the hospital who wants the patients because they've built an infrastructure that's very valuable. And the providers that have these exclusive agreements at these hospitals, all of them are going to have an interest in being at the highest level rating to give the best care. And by doing so, we'll actually could eliminate the need for a complex agreement about what do you pay them when they're out of network. We can shine a good enough spotlight on it to where people are afraid to bring to the market an insurance plan that only includes the building and not the doctors in it. And the doctors are afraid to be working at a hospital that doesn't have all four specialties in network. They'll be pressure on all those people involved, all three. But the beauty is it takes the pressure off the patient. Thank you. Thank you. Do you further you? Yeah, yes, sir. Chair recognizes representative Jasmine Clark to your left for a question. Does the gentleman yield? Yes. So I have a question. If you mentioned emergency appendicitis earlier, so I'm just going to use that as an example. If I have emergency appendicitis and I call the ambulance and the ambulance takes me to the hospital, how exactly does this rating system help me since I don't really get much of a choice of what hospital I go to? And we can use any emergency. I just use emergency appendicitis to assess what you mentioned. Two things come into play. Number one, if you're in a fully insured plan that Georgia has control over, then House Bill 888 would take care of it for you. If you're in that 13 to 20% that this bill, we can't control the risk of plans that are federally regulated from this building. So we can influence them in what we hope is that your employer, or maybe you, if you were trying to decide which insurance plan amongst several to choose from, if you had that opportunity, you would be able to go before you purchase that insurance plan and find out, oh, look, it has these three hospitals. And this is the one I'd want to go to in an emergency. And look, it has four green checks or it has a green check under emergency medicine. So you would know you would be protected. It ideally would be done at the time of purchase or at the time an employer is purchasing for a large number. At the moment of the emergency and all, there's some federal ACA rules that come in, the Affordable Care Act rules that come into place that determine who can build what on a risk of plans. And then we've solved for the Georgia regulated plans. We've solved that with 888. So I hope that helps. Did you further yield? Sure. So that makes a little sense to me. But for example, not every employer offers choices when it comes to their insurance. And there are also people, such as small business owners and others who, when they're trying to make these choices, of course, they're going to probably want a four-check hospital, but you have to take into account costs. So I guess I'm wondering, how does this affect those people, those people who don't have choices, or those people who maybe these four-check providers are cost prohibitive? The two questions there. But on the provision, you're right. A lot of employers just say, this is the plan we have. But employers do listen to their employees. And they want to make sure you may have a strong opinion about what hospitals you want in network, either for OB care or joint care or pediatric care. You may have a strong preference. And a lot of employees, employee groups, communicate that to HR, especially if they didn't like last year's plan. They communicate and say, we want something better this year. And so they maybe they change plans. So it includes these three hospitals over here, and not just these two over there. So the employers are already getting feedback from their employees, because they want a plan that they're using it themselves often, like I do with my group's plan. But they want their employees to be happy. They want them to have a plan that includes the hospitals that they want to go to. This just takes that one little step further and says, not only are we going to make sure that the building that my employees want to go to, if it's an HR or CEO, making a decision, are the doctors and the providers inside that building also included? It gives them a little bit more information. As far as whether the price will go up or down, as we already mentioned, it's a three-way negotiation where the hospital is going to want everybody in network. The doctors are going to have pressure to be in network. The insurance wants to sell a plan that looks like the plan. We always thought we were getting. We always thought we got a hospital. We got the doctors who worked in it too. That's why I call it a surprise bill. It comes out of nowhere and nobody can anticipate it. So that's the problem we're looking to solve. I think it will take, as it goes into, this plan will go into effect, if signed by the governor, go into effect in October, which is right before open enrollment. We want to put a spotlight on the plans that are being offered. It gives some time for everybody to negotiate to where all the hospitals that are in a plan's network would be four green checks. Thank you. Thank you. Speaker, I'll yield the well at this time and let us get on with other important business. But I appreciate your support on the surprise bill Transparency Act. Gentlemen, has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question? Being ordered on House Bill 789. The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? Chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machines. The clerk will unlock the machines on the passage of House Bill 789. The eyes are 170. The knees are one. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. The clerk will read the caption to House Resolution. I'm sorry. House Bill 957. House Bill 957. My synopsis of Jones. The 47th jaspers of the 11th. Chalkers of the 38th and others. To be entitled back to a men in title 20. The fiscal to George Antony relating education generally. So as to provide that certain charter school employee, he shall be included in health insurance fund for public school teachers. This bill having referred to the committee on education. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes the speaker protein to present the bill. Well, thank you, Mr. Speaker. House Bill 957 contains five revisions to current charter school law that were brought to me by the Department of Audits, the State Charter School Commission, or locally approved charter schools. And it does not contain significant changes to current policy. The first one just clarifies that State Charter School teachers are eligible to participate in the state health benefit plan. They do currently, and the AG has continually affirmed that. As an aside, they do pay into the state teacher's retirement pension fund as well. But it adds article 31A to the section of a code that affirms that public school teachers that work at charter schools are eligible for the state health benefit plan. Section number two adds back into code a provision that was inadvertently omitted last year in other legislation that allows charter schools and is primarily locally approved charter schools to establish residency at the time of application. Section three extends the terms of the State Charter School Commission from two years to four years, and it staggers their terms. Section four makes it clear that student records are the property of a state charter school, and when they close those records eventually go back to the State Charter School Commission. And finally, section five shifts the deadline for a required virtual school performance audit from December 1 to April 1. So as to incorporate up to date academic data, that's what the bill does and I'd be happy to yield for questions. You have no questions. Well, thank you, and I would appreciate your favorable consideration of House Bill 957. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered to Chair Hearsenund? The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee Substitute? The Chair Hearsenund, the Committee Substitute, is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair Hearsenund, the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of House Bill 957 will vote aye. Those opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines. On the passage of House Bill 957, the eyes are 165. The nays are four. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. This House will come to order. It had been the Chair's intention to not call House Bill 966 until later in the calendar, but due to popular demand. In the curiosity that is killing the Chair, because I understand I missed one of the greatest committee meetings ever held in Capitol Hill. The clerk will read the caption to House Bill 966. House Bill 966 by Ruppson. I've participated in the 176 Corbord and 174th Berkland, 155th McCall, and the 33rd and others to be titled an act to amend Chapter 6 and Title 12, the official of Georgia, and Tate, relating to forest resources and other plant light. So it's to regulate the harvest and sale of palmetto berries. This bill I refer to the Committee on Agriculture Consumer Affairs. That committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes Representative Birchett to present the bill. Please members of the House will please give attention to the member in the well. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. esteemed colleagues, I've come to you today to talk about a very serious issue we face in South Georgia. The problem that we're trying to rectify with this bill is that we have a bush in South Georgia called a palmetto bush. And on these personal properties and state properties, what's happening is bus loads of harvesters are being dropped off under the cover of darkness and harvesting these berries to the tunes of hundreds of thousands of dollars and illegally selling them south of the border in Florida. So what this bill is intended to do is make it easier for law enforcement to do their job and enforce the law and crack down on some of this illegal harvest. What it does is it sets up a certificate of harvest and it's a very simple and low threshold. What a harvester would do would go to a landowner and say I'd like to harvest the berries on your property. And the certificate would essentially be the landowner given name, address, information and signing over the permission to the harvester to allow them to be on their property to harvest those berries. The harvester would keep this certificate throughout the process harvesting, transporting and selling these berries. Therefore allowing law enforcement, excuse me, law enforcement, the opportunity to in the event they stop some of these harvesters with berries to verify that these are legal berries and they can be sold here in the state of Georgia. The problem has been exacerbated most recently because Florida has passed some legislation to regulate this berry in South Georgia. Excuse me, North Florida. And so most of these folks are coming north of the border to come and collect these berries on both personal property and state property. Essentially, that's what the bill does and I will yield for questions. Well you have a few. But of course what you don't know is the chair had appointed a committee after committee to prepare this bill to come on the floor. So I'm going to recognize Representative Mom to hand for the first question. Representative Barchett, thank you Mr. Speaker. Representative Barchett, I understand this to be your first bill. Is that correct? Yes sir. Well congratulations on your first bill and taking on such a hard one. I do have a question. So after these criminals steal these berries, must they be used immediately or is there a point where they just get too old to be used anymore? That's a good question. I appreciate the gentleman bringing that question. I don't participate in the berry production myself so I don't know the answer to that. But it would just essentially allow them to pick those berries and give them that certificate so that they can legally have those berries in possession when they take them to sale. Okay, that answer question. Thank you. Chair recognizes Representative, I don't think this is a problem where he lives but Representative Ridley for a question to your right. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Come on friend in the well. I'm not even going to ask you to yield because I'm afraid you'll say no so I'm just going to go ahead with my question. Could you kind of describe why these berries are so valuable and what the medical use is for these? As I understand it these berries have a medicinal value for the male prostate. So one more question I guess going to lead now for that. Could you dictate to us the stiffness of the penalties that you put in this bill? Yes sir. If you're these penalties are they align with the rest of the criminal code and that if you get caught without this certificate then you will be charged with a misdemeanor unless the berries are in value greater than $1500 in which you'd be prosecuted for a felony. Excuse me. All right. I've lost all training thought. Yeah. That sort of happens sometimes when that happens. But anyway I don't have any other questions. I think there's a few others in here to take a poke at this. Chair recognizes the speaker protein to your right for a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes I do. It's not true that you solicited my strong support and sympathy for this issue and for not only yourself since you in fact grow these berries but for many of your constituents and other folks in South Georgia. Yes ma'am. And is it also true if the gentleman for the yield that not once in your rather long winded and thorough explanation of why this bill was so important did you ever once indicate the purpose of salt palmetto berries? I believe the gentleman lady knows what she speaks. Thank you. Chair recognizes this issue is spreading all across the state. Representative Al Williams to your left for a question. Gentlemen you. Yes sir. I'm very honest with you. I plead complete ignorance after talking to some people. I own a lot of palmetto and I often wonder then maybe you could help me. I thought there was supplementary sources of security why so many old men were picking my berries. I don't know but don't know the answer to that. Gentlemen further yield. Yes sir. I just did not expect someone as young and on his first bill to be so concerned about this issue. Fair point. I will conclude by saying, sir, when you come back, when you lose some of your hair like me and I'm still here and you agree I think you'll have a different feeling and you can take that down because folk will knock you out for that bottle. I yield the well. Representative I think that's more than yielding. I think that is running from the well. All right. House will be in order. What purpose does Chairman McCall rise? I told him I had no idea that palmata bushes had berries on. It was an interesting ad committee meeting but what seal the deal on importance of how we need to take care of palmata bear business in the state is when representative LaRique told me that his wife makes him a palmata bear smoothie about once a week. We farther more need a vote for this bill. Thank you sir. That purpose does representative cannon rise. Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not true that the sponsor did not speak to the process of getting the certificate before you're facing a misdemeanor or a felony? Could you repeat that? Is it not true that the bill sponsor did not speak to the process for getting the certificate before you're facing the misdemeanor? If the lady so states we have some others. What purpose does representative Henson rise? Thank you Mr. Speaker. Parliamentary inquiry. Is it true that if this can result in a felony and is it not true that that would remain on someone's record? Therefore it was someone young, a teen, ager. This could be on his record forever that he has a felony. And further is it not true that this is a pretty strict punishment for something like picking palmato berries? Well, I mean that's what everyone has to determine for themselves. You have the bill, you can read the bill, a felony unless it expuns in some fashion, would stay on one's record. What purpose does representative Jasmine Clark rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Is it not true that this bill does not outline how many berries have to be stolen in order for this to be a felony? Once again that every member can read the bill and answer those kind of questions without doing parliamentary inquiries. What purpose does representative mom to hand rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not true that the representative spoke and he rose upright to speak about this issue in full? If the gentleman believes that to be true, I'm sure it probably is. Thank you miss. Okay. This is a very serious matter. Chair is going to ask the clerk before we vote to read House Bill 133. House Rule 133, one of the question is put. The member within the chamber shall vote unless the member is immediately and particularly interested therein or unless the member is excused by the House. The motion by the member to be excused from voting must be made before the House divides or before the calls of the yeas and nays is commenced and it shall be decided without debate. The member making the motion may briefly state the reason why it should prevail and in every case where the seat of the member is being contested to sitting member of the contestant shall both retire from the House before the vote is taken. This House will avoid conflicts of interest at all measure. Now is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none of the previous question.

As ordered, is there any objection to adopting the Committee substitute? The Chair here's none. The Committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of House Bill 966. Will vote aye, those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines. On the passage of House Bill 966, the eyes are 125, the knees are 42. House Bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 830. House Bill 830, members, an event in the 31st of Utah in the act to amend Code Section 47, 2087, the fiscal to Georgia, and to the ruling eligible large retirement systems authorized to invest in certain alternative investments. This bill then referred to the Committee on Retirement. The Committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes Chairman Benton to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, the House, I come for you today to present House Bill 830. House Bill 830 is a bill that would allow eligible large retirement systems to increase their alternative investment from 5% to 10%. And I want to read to you what is considered to be a eligible large retirement system. Any retirement system created by this title which has an accumulated unfunded act swear or accrued value not greater than 25%. The Georgia Municipal Employee Benefits System, any public retirement system other than a retirement system defined in any of the other paragraphs, the retirement system has an accumulated unfunded act swear or liability not greater than 25% of the total assets of its assets. Any public retirement system which has more than 200 million in assets, this is a bill that would allow these retirement systems to up their investment and alternative investment. This is something that a lot of these retirement systems are asking for and this bill would do that. The eligible part of the bill at the time this bill was written, teacher retirement system was not part of an eligible retirement system. Employee retirement, firefighters pension fund, those were two of the larger ones that were able to do this. I do want to point out that the earnings from two of these have been very well. The firefighters pension fund has been able to do 10% since 2012. Right now they are funding that they are using is running at about 16% and has been a very good return. The employee retirement system although they have not been in it very long has is running better than their stock investments. Mr. Speaker that is the bill. I would be glad to answer any questions if anyone has one. You do not have any questions. One other statement I wanted to make is that right now teacher retirement is not part of this but the Senate passed a bill the other day that would allow them to do 5% with this bill. It would raise it to 10% we are in negotiations with teacher retirement on this but I would appreciate a yes vote on this bill so that we can move forward. Thank you. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered the chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill the chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of House bill 830 will vote aye those opposed to vote no in the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House bill 830 the eyes are 12 this bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House bill 932. House bill 932. The governor of the 17th Cooper the 43rd and others to be entitled to amend chapter 7 and 14 and chapter 35 and the official to Georgia and to the professional corporations and the Georgia podiatry practice act this bill had referred to the committee on health and human services that committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative gains to present the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker today I bring House bill 932 this legislation allows podiatrist and physicians to organize and jointly own a professional corporation as an example of podiatrist and a primary care doc may find that they could operate a professional corporation more efficiently together potentially encouraging their location rule Georgia and other places across the state. For podiatrists and doctors who use this opportunity to perform a professional corporation they will make their operations more convenient for patients patients will be able to follow up with especially care in the office just down the hall rather than being referred across town or otherwise and in the same respect diabetic patients visiting a podiatrist will be able to see and be diagnosed by a primary care physician. It's a win-win for patients and for the podiatrist and physicians. I'll close with this from Duke University study using a multi-disciplinary team approach most effectively prevents complications from diabetes and reduces the risk of amputations. This legislation provides one more opportunity for physicians and podiatrists to effectively treat patients and makes it easier on patients who when seeking their care. Mr. Speaker I'm happy to answer any questions. You have a question if you care to you. I will. Chair recognizes representative Jasmine Clark to your left for a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker does it generally you. I will. Similar to the question I asked about the chiropractor bill and since surprise billing has been the subject of the day how will this affect patients when it comes to being billed by their insurance since they would be effectively seeing two different types of people but in the same office visit. This would not have any changes as they're currently if they're going to podiatrist and a physician separately. It doesn't change scope of practice. All it allows is for the podiatrist and physician to organize jointly. Professor Corporation. Does the gentleman for the yield? Sure. Get two bills one from the doctor and one from the podiatrist. As I understand it. As I understand that's right. Thank you. Thank you Mr. Speaker I yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered the chair here is none. The previous question is ordered is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute to chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill the chair here is done the report of the committee. Is agreed to shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of House Bill 932 will vote aye those opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? If so the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 932 the eyes are 167 the nasor zero this bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 755. House Bill 755 I'm going to submit the 112th and others to be titled back to amend code section 22 20068.1 of the fiscal to Georgia and it related the Charter School funding says to provide that local boards of education shall provide local charter schools with itemized allotment sheets for the upcoming fiscal year. This bill I refer to committee on education that committee recommends a dis bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes chairman belt and to present the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker. This body should be very very proud that due to a law y'all passed a few years ago tech Georgia along with Texas are the two most fiscally transparent states in the union in terms of schools and school boards. So I appreciate y'all doing that. This bill just expands that in particular to charter schools as you know charter schools are different than traditional schools they need have a charter contract that includes a lot of financial accountability metrics that they have to deal with and then unfortunately they're not getting the information they need. This bill is not punitive to the school boards because the data is already there it doesn't cost me a thing we want them to post it. I also want to thank Representative Michael Smith for adding a section in this bill in order to not to burden the rules chairman too much is a lot of education bills. We add some language about school choice transfers within the district for schools as well. And I also want to thank a reputant stove all for the nice letter she wrote about this particularly the need for this particular bill and I yield for questions. You do not have any questions. Now you'll the will. Gentlemen as you'll the well the chair recognizes representative stove all to speak to the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Thanks for the appreciation the chairman built in for bringing this bill. Members are rise for your support of House bill 755 because it is the right thing to do. How many of you how many of you all find it difficult to stick with the budget. Just imagine what would happen if you did a budget not knowing your actual earnings. Some expenses would get paid while others would not. Can you like to have the peace of mind of the amount you will receive. This is the struggle many of our charter schools are facing across Georgia. The allowedment sheets give the schools an exact amount for funding for each student based on his or her category. Without those allowedment sheets the charter schools and our children are getting short change. The school districts have been funding the charter for the basic QBE which is a quality based education allocation and not actually what they're supposed to earn. The charter schools are already underfunded so not having the accurate funding amount as that's for rates to struggle even more. Many of you have heard me talk about seven pillars career academy in Clayton County. On your desk as chairman built in reference is a letter from Miss Christina Gain who's the head of school at seven pillars. Explain the school's personal experience and the unnecessary struggle. This school has over 20% of their population developmental disability and close to 50% have identified for the remediation program. Both populations gone on higher rate than the basic QBE that they're receiving now. Seven pillars is still expected to provide costly services for those students to meet their legal obligations, medical obligations and wraparound services. All line items in the budget are affected when the allowedment sheet is not obtained in a timely manner. For example none student services such as school nursing, nutrition, state health benefit contribution and other areas that the DOE funds. These constraints have resulted in the release of staff, a decrease in services and other cuts that weaken the culture and climate at the school. The schools can guarantee accuracy of their earned funds when they don't know what those funds are. The full time equivalency known as the FTE is calculated twice a year in October and March. The March count of all the students present at schools would have already been done in order to generate their allowedment sheet. The school districts are dispersed a dollar amount, equalling the number of students and categories which are the students that are enrolled. If that number of actual enrollment is lower and the districts receive the money on the higher estimate, the districts are not required to return their excess money. They are held harmless in other words. The districts which receive an overpayment would get to keep the money. But the charter schools receiving the amount higher than the regional projections, the districts takes that money from the charter and doesn't hold them harmless like the state DOE does to them. So I'm asking for your favorite consideration on House Bill 755 and I'll yield for any questions, Mr. Speaker. You do not have any questions. Thank you, I yield a will. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of House Bill 755? Will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 755. The eyes are 163. The nays are four. House Bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Chair recognizes Chairman Andy Wilch for a motion. Thank you, Mr. Vigor. I move that the House agreed to the Senate substitute of H.R. 164 as amended by the House. Chairman Wilch has moved that this House agree to the Senate substitute to House Resolution 164 as amended by the House. It is amendment AEM 340808. Clerk will read the caption. House Resolution 164 by resident of Powell, 171 Williamson 115. Well, so 110th and others proposing an amendment to the Constitution so as to authorize the general assembly to provide by general law for the dedication of revenues derived from fees or taxes to the public purpose. Chair recognizes Chairman Wilch to explain his motion. Thank you, Mr. Vigor. Members of the House, you were a call that last year you passed out House Resolution 164 presented to you by our dearly departed Chairman Jay Powell. This was his measure, his fee dedication, constitutional amendment, and it was passed by this House unanimously by partisan support both in the sponsorship of the measure and by your votes. That has gone to the Senate. The Senate has proposed a substitute which they have sent to you which is on your desk. The Senate substitute removed the core parts of the measure leaving it only to apply to the Solid Waste Trust Fund and the hazardous waste trust fund. The House amendment that you have before you restores the expanse of the amendment that you passed before that was Chairman Jay Powell's bill. This would allow for the dedication of taxes and fees for their intended purpose with a cap on the amount that can be done so at a 1% of the state budget. It does integrate a concept that the Senate did put in their substitute. As an offer of compromise in this process, we did include the executive branch's authority that under a physical emergency, the executive branch could suspend the dedication of those fees while we're not in session. When we return to session, however, the constitutional amendment would require us to act, either do nothing or agree with the executive branch's decision as to the reallocation of those fees. Remember this also sets a timeline. This is, I think, a true middle ground in terms of the appropriation process when we dedicate fees currently. If you want to dedicate fees or taxes, you have to pass a constitutional amendment. And the voters will vote on that. That money is then locked aside. It cannot be touched by the General Assembly. It cannot be reappropriated. This measure allows us as a General Assembly to act as appropriators with respect to the dedication and limit the duration in which those fees may be dedicated for a year or up to 10 years. It sets that cap that we've talked about before at a 1%. And it also recognizes that in cases of physical emergency of the state, either the executive branch or the General Assembly may take action to rededicate those fees or suspend the dedication of those fees so that we can get through a hard time should we have one. With that, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Speaker, I would like just to remind everyone that this measure has been one that we've worked on for many, many years. It would bring a level of accountability back to those fees and it would bring back truth in taxation and truth in fee dedication. And I would ask for your favorable support of that. I will say this that it was several years ago that Chairman Powell undertook this endeavor when he actually asked me to amend one of his bills while he was in the hospital with his daughter Jessica. And he asked me to make the same motion as to one of his bills and that bill was a fee rollback bill. And you may recall that I think it was back in 2012, 2013 where it actually rolled back the fee if we didn't appropriate it. And we amended the hazardous waste trust fund or the solid waste trust fund with that rollback. And we sent it back to the Senate. Since that time we've been working on this constitutional amendment and I would ask that you join me again in a favorable and unanimous adoption of this measure. One last point before I take questions, I'll note that today is March the 3rd. March the 3rd is a very important day to me and my family because it happens to be my birthday. So if you would do me the pleasure, I know you all can't light up candles for me. It burned the house down at my age. But if you could, I wouldn't mind it if you just bring out a blaze of green glory on the board over there and recognition of such a fine birthday. But I'll take questions in this time, Mr. Speaker. Shameless. You have a couple of questions. Do you yield? I do. Yes. I do. Yes, sir. Chair recognizes Representative Williamson to your ride for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Jim, I do. Yes, sir, I do. I appreciate your hard work on this measure and I have one simple question. Yes. Would Chairman Jay Powell approve of this amendment? I believe you would, yes, sir. And I know that he would because you as a co-sponsor, the second signer of the resolution, you have endorsed this as well and I appreciate that. Thank you for the good work. Thank you. Are you for the questions, Mr. Speaker? You have no further questions. With that, I ask for your favorable consideration and I hope you'll wish me a happy birthday. Chair will read the, I'm sorry, clerk will read the caption to the amendment. I'm in the Senate's substitute, H.R. 164, LC34 5570S by deleting all matters from lines one through the end and inserting and loo thereof the following. Is there any objection to the adoption of the House amendment AM340808? Chair, here's none in the House amendment is adopted on the gentleman's motion that the House agree to the Senate's substitute to House resolution 164 as amended by this House. All those in favor will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the gentleman's motion, the eyes are 164, the nays are four. This House has agreed to the Senate's substitute to House resolution 164 as amended by this House. Chair recognizes representative Reeves, the governor's four leader for a motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move that the House agree to the Senate's substitute to House bill 444. Representative Reeves has moved that the House agree to the Senate's substitute to House bill 444, the clerk will read the caption. The House bill 444 by Representative Reeves, the 34th law of the 120th second, Rogers the 10th and others to be a tunnel act to amend. Title 20, the fiscal to Georgia and the Teddy relating education, so as to revise the move on when ready act. Chair recognizes representative Reeves to explain the Senate's substitute. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The first thing that I want to say, I know there's a lot of confusion, but today and yesterday you have two bills that have been put on your desk and one of them has the 10 first page and this is the bill from last year and so we can disregard this. This is not what we're voting on here today. We're voting on the Senate's substitute. A lot of work has gone into this issue to refresh you last year. We passed a version of House bill 444 and when we got to the Senate we realized that we needed to take a step backwards and take a harder look at things.

bring this issue back up this year. And that's exactly what we did. And there was a tremendous amount of work that took place over the summer and fall with all the stakeholders and crafting the fairest way to resolve this issue in light of the fact of the budget item growing from $23 million to what could be between $125 and $145 million for next year. This came, you know, I'm holding in my hand an audit that was from January of 2018. So this is two years and two months old. This is an audit of the dual enrollment program. And this audit identified over two years ago that controls needed to be put in place in this program. As the program was amended in 2015, essentially the ceiling was, and the walls were taken off of it. And it's been the highest fastest growing budget item in our state since then. So this came out over two years ago. This was not, this was out before anybody was even, but before the parties had even nominated their, their nominee for governor through the primary. That's how long this conversation has been going. And since this came out, a lot of the warnings in here have manifested exactly as projected and the program has continued to grow. I want to talk, I want to walk through the bill, House Bill 444, which is the Senate sub, that is on your desk. So first thing I'm going to talk about, before I talk about grandfather's students is moving forward. So students who have yet to do a role in high school, or who have yet to be of the age of eligibility, moving forward, if they are do enrolling for purposes of university system courses, they will be subject to a 30 hour cap. The state is going to pay for 30 hours of credit. And beyond that, they are eligible to do a role, all they want either to pay for out of pocket, or if their school system so pleases, then the school system can use the FTE money they receive for that student to pay for them to do a role above 30 hours. There are going to be limited to core courses. And this was, frankly, I got very little push back on this. This is, there's over 2,500 core courses that are available. And I think this is just common sense. Our core courses are the courses that are most likely to transfer and be accepted, and to receive that college credit for. And the program is going to be limited to 11th and 12th graders moving forward. With the exception of if the student is a 10th grade student, and they've otherwise qualified for the Zill Miller Scholarship, which requires a certain ACT, SAT, and a score, and a GPA. And there are a significant number of students at our state that do qualify for that at the end of their freshman year. They would be eligible to do a role there 10th grade year. So now I'm going to talk about how this bill is going to treat technical students, TCSG, technical college system of Georgia students. So we're moving on from university to technical schools now. Technical skills are also going to be subject to the 30 hour cap. And their limitation in courses is going to be what we call the CTAE courses, which is Career Technology, Agriculture, and Education. There are over 4,500 CTAE courses. So again, no shortage there. For TCSG students will be allowed to do a role of 10th, 11th, and 12th grade years. There's something very important, a caveat that I need to talk about. I need to explain to you part of the rationale with the growth of the program from 2015 and the state's investment in that has been dedicated and related to our vocational and technical students. For the purpose of preparing Georgia students to be workforce ready by the time that they graduate high school, that was a major focus back in 2015. And this body has continued to make investments in that program. And in that concept, since then, and so what's very important to understand is that this bill does not stop or interfere with that idea. So as I mentioned, technical students will be allowed to take 30 hours of state pay dual enrollment. However, if they are what is referred to as an SB2 student or an option B student, which is a contractual agreement that a student makes with the state themselves in their high school that allows them to replace some of the high school credits that most students take in order to be eligible to graduate. They can take vocational technical classes instead. That's an SB2 student or students that are in the technical programs that are enrolled in one of what we call the 17 high demand career initiative programs. So there are 17 programs. In fact, here they are. Automotive, aviation. Certified engineer, assistant, commercial truck drive and computer program, computer technology, construction, diesel equipment, technology, early childhood care and education, electrical line worker, health science, industrial maintenance, logistics, movie production set design, practical nursing, precision manufacturing, and welding and joining technology. These are careers where we have a workforce deed in Georgia. And there are opportunities at our technical schools for students to take these programs, to engage in these programs and earn number one of certification, number two of diploma. And in some cases, number three in associate's degree in these 17 fields. And if they are in one of those 17 fields, which these are just umbrella fields, there's multiple programs underneath each of these 17 categories. If they are in one of those or if they are an SB2 student, then they will be eligible to use 30 hours of their hope grant to apply to that. So they will have 30 hours of dual enrollment state paid and then 30 hours of hope grant in one of these 17 programs. That's a total of 60 hours. And with that 60 hours, you can earn every certificate and every diploma in the state. And in most cases in associate's degree, this is a very key part of this bill, y'all. We are not abandoning our investment in workforce development this part of this program is what is so popular, especially in rural Georgia. And this effort will continue and students will have these opportunities under this new bill. We're continuing that investment. So now I'm gonna switch gears and talk about the grandfathered students, okay? And you've probably gotten a few emails. I think I've probably responded to emails from just about everybody's constituents in this room right now. Here is how the grandfathering process is going to work under the new bill. Right now, current in technical schools, if we're in a technical college system of Georgia, current SB2 students or students that are in the high demand career initiative programs receive unlimited hours. There is no cap, okay? The students that are in those programs now, they're not subject to the 30 hours of dual enrollment and then the 30 hours of hope grant. They are receiving unlimited hours. And then moving over to USG university students, if they have more than 18 hours, whether that number's 19 or whether it's 30 or 40 or 50 hours, no matter how many hours they have, they receive 12 more hours next year. So for a lot of, some of you have heard from constituents who have students right now who are juniors, who are current juniors and they have somewhere, they have more than 18 hours. They will receive essentially a semester of paid for dual enrollment by the state next year. But there's options. What about after that? Well, there's options here. Number one, if they're able to, they can pay out of pocket to finish, they want that one last semester to dual enrollment. They can also petition their school to pay for it. And there are school systems around the state that are going to do this. They're gonna take some of that money that they're receiving for what is in some cases an empty seat in their classrooms and in their schools and use some of that money to allow that student to finish their dual enrollment. And they also, many would have the option to graduate early. High school students graduate at the end of their fall semester often all the time. And if staying in the college level program is that it's that important, they can arrange to graduate high school early and then thus as a high school graduate, they're eligible for the hope scholarship that can enroll in the USG full time and become a college student. Let me talk really quick about some data. The average public school student in the state of Georgia that dual enrolls takes 17 hours as the average. So our bill, House Bill 444, is offering 30 hours of state paid for credit. That's almost twice what the average is. Of that average, of that 17 hours, 64% of the current 52,050 students that are in dual enrollment, 64% or 33,163 are taking below the 17 hours and only 36% or 18,887 are currently above 17 hours. Now let me go a little bit deeper, 30 hours of the 52,050 students right now, 6,397 are above 30 hours currently. And 4,709 of those are seniors, which essentially leaves the population of juniors which are the seniors won't be affected by this bill because they're about to graduate. So about 1,600 juniors are already above, junior sophomores and freshmen are above the 30 hours. They are going to receive 12 more hours of state paid for and then beyond that, there will be opportunities for the dual enrolls that are on their own or with the help from their school. But what's important, and I say this, do we understand when I say that the average is 17 hours, the majority of these students are on the lower end of that average. They take less than 17 hours. The mode, which is the most frequently occurring number of classes, most students take, most of its durol actually take two classes. Again, the numbers are on the lower end, which means that this bill of these changes are not going to impact the majority of the students that dual enroll. I know that a lot of you have discussed the hope scholarship and why can't we use the hope scholarship. And it's very simple. Here's a copy of the Georgia Constitution. There's language in the Constitution that says, we cannot use the hope scholarship to supplant current existing programs or replace. And so we cannot use hope scholarship money to pay for somebody's dual enrollment because it would be supplanting an existing state program called dual enrollment. The independent college's Marine Downey with the A.J.C. a few weeks ago wrote a story. She quoted Susanna Baxter who wrote about, and this is online about the Atlanta Georgia Constitution tuition wrote about how if this bill fails, essentially, the changes that this could bring to our independent colleges could be devastating. One of the likely things that may happen if the bill fails is that the student finance is going to cut the rates that it pays the schools, including our private independent schools, which are prevalent throughout, especially our rural communities. A lot of our rural students that dual enroll, they do it through your independent private schools. And if those rates are cut, then they, in all likelihood, may not be able to offer as much. And that opportunity goes away. There's been a lot of misinformation about this bill. In the Senate side, we heard about how there was no data. No data. We have no data on this. What we do, there's 61.8% of the students that dual enroll are female. 44% of the students that dual enroll are minority. In poverty, 27.8% of the students in dual enrollment are in high poverty. And 19.3% are what is considered low poverty by tamph, temporary assistance for needy families. And what's important about House Bill 444, y'all, and this is what I'm really getting at here, is that House Bill 444 is the plan, the way that we put this program together, we achieve what its goals are. And its goal was never to replace high school with college. It was never the goal of this program. The goal of this program was to allow students to get a jump start. And by doing this, and by what, the way we have constructed House Bill 444, it is inclusive. It allows all of our students across the state the opportunity to dual enroll. Everyone that wants to will have an opportunity to take those 30 hours. This is qualifying week, and it's symbolic of a lot of things because there's politics and there's governing. And there's a difference, as we all know, anybody who's sat in this room, some folks in this room, have only been here for a few weeks. There's politics and there's governing. And we can find easy political points at a whole lot of things we do up here. And we can vote no in protest, and take some easy political points here. We can do that. But I want to ask everybody in this room to recognize something. Will we press our green button or our red button? If you hit your green button, you're voting for a program that's inclusive. A program that's going to give every student the chance to take advantage of this program if they want to. And if you hit the red button, this program will be capped. This program will be capped around $100 million in student finance. The Office of Student Finance is going to have to figure out how to run this program in that capped budget. And what that means is that in all likelihood, a line's going to be drawn. And not every student's going to get to dual enroll. Now, whether that's by means testing, by lottery, or first come first serve, I don't know. But we will certainly lose control of that in this body. And it will be up to them. But what we can do in this body right now is by hitting our green button and voting yes, every single one of the kids in our district will get the chance to take those 30 hours of state paid dual enrollment. That is what this program was intended for. It was not intended to replace. So Mr. Speaker, I will certainly take questions. So you have, it's like about 13 to 14 questions. Whatever your pleasure is. No, it's yours. I mean, you can yield or not, you. Do you yield? I feel that I need to at least take a question or two, because in transparency and the magnitude of this and the work that's gone into this, I'm certainly not afraid. I'm willing to take a few questions. Chair recognizes Chairman Setsler to your right for a question. Mr. Jim and Neil, I do. I want to clarify a couple things. I want to ask a question for folks who are thinking maybe they should know on this. Did I hear you say that 68% of the people that are enrolled in dual enrollment right now are females in Georgia? 61.8. And 44% of minorities. That's right. As I think about this, this General Assembly acted a few years back to preserve hope's scholarship, to keep it so that it wouldn't become less accessible to students by making some smart, thoughtful controls on it, which is what I understand you're trying to do here. In it true, the dollars that fund this dual enrollment program come from our QBE funding formula? Yes. So the money we're talking about here is a QBE formula, which funds our entire statewide school system. Now, in it true under the current dual enrollment program versus say another program, if you take an AP class in your high school, the QBE formula fund you for one class. But in a dual enrollment, in it true that both the high school gets funded and the college gets funded for broad and the school is funded. Yes, and let me get back and correct something that I said. This is an appropriated program. The schools receive QBE funding, the colleges receive funding, but the money that is used to pay for the dual enrollment credit hours is an appropriated amount of money that we do in this body. Right. And I asked the question because the program is as popular as it's been in providing access to kids who may not have a lot of AP classes in their schools, we're funding an extra amount of money out of QBE to prop this program up and keep it going in an unlimited fashion, are we not? That's right. So what we're saying here is is that kids can take 30 hours of college credit in high school and can continue to in this double funded program, which is good for their school system and good for the college they're taking classes from. But we can't continue in an unlimited way to keep propping that up, isn't it true? Yes, and with the 30 hours plus the 127 hours of hope scholarship, state even under the bill is offering 157 hours of free college courses, which is one of the most generous programs in the country. So that, one last question for you. So that out of the 52,000 students, 45,000 of those are taking less than 30 hours. Is that not true by your numbers? I believe so, yes. Yes, sir. So I say this to our members. If they're thinking about voting no on this, this is a way to keep this great program functioning and not come unglued at the hinges with the runaway cost here so we can protect it, not hurt it. Is that not what you're doing with this? Absolutely. So I would just close. I appreciate your answer to my questions. I just would ask members to think about that because of what we're doing with this, if we support this program and support the recognition of how generous it is, a no vote will be turning our back on the long term viability program. That's right. Thank you, Chairman. And Mr. Speaker, I am aware of the vibe of the room right now. The eye is staring at me. And I'm willing to answer questions, but I believe that everybody in here is ready for me to yield the will. And I will do so. A smart man. On the gentleman's motion that this house agree to the Senate substitute to House Bill 444, all those in favor will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does representative Lopez Ramero rise? Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. They sure inquiry. Isn't it true that as a fiscal year 2020, dual enrollment represents less than 2% of our total K through 12 and higher education spending? So this is not a runaway program. If the lady so states an additional parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker, I've got others I'm going to have to move on if we're going to have any more. Thank you. What purpose does representative Jasmine Clark rise? Parliamentary inquiry. They sure inquiry. Isn't that true that the sponsor of this bill spoke about the average number of students only taking 17 hours? And therefore, if the majority of the students are not actually using up the funds, then this does not actually fix the problem of cost since only a small percentage of people are actually looking for the dollar. I'm sure she believes that to be true. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. All right. All those in favor of the bill are voting aye. Those opposed are voting no. If all members voted have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the gentleman's motion. The eyes are 103. The nays are 67. This House has agreed to the Senate substitute to House Bill 444.
