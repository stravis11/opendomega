TRANSCRIPT
----------
We're good, we're good afternoon. How y'all doing?
Well, there's been a lot of people in the capitol today and of course there's still a lot of people in the capitol now.
I just want to thank y'all for being here. This is kind of a moldy purpose of press conference today.
We're going to talk about literacy and we're going to talk about literacy and we're going to talk about literacy.
Okay, and so first of all, I would like to like to introduce to the
representative, Bethy Ballard, who is the mother, the mother of House Bill
538, the Georgia Early Literacy Act, and she's going to talk a little bit
about that, and then I'm going to turn it over to Senator Clint Dixon to talk
about Senate Bill 464, and then I'm going to talk about our amendment to that
Bill, and then Mr. Scott Johnson, who was chairman of Georgia Council of
Literacy, will talk about the Council's involvement in this. So, Representative
Ballard. Thank you. In the last legislative session, I was proud to sponsor
House Bill 538, the Georgia Early Literacy Act, which mandates that schools
use a literacy curriculum that's aligned with the science of reading and
and structured literacy.
And this requires a return to the foundational principles
of literacy that are evidence based
and have been proven to work,
to teach our kids to read.
To do this, one of the things we need to do
is be able to identify these struggling readers
early in their school careers
so that they can get intensive instruction
in order to be proficient by the end of third grade
because by the end of third grade statistics tell us
that that is when students need to be proficient
so that they have success in later life.
If they don't have proficiency
by third grade statistics show,
they will not be successful.
What this means is we have to have quality assessment tools.
We have to have assessment tools that measure
what we want them to measure
and that tools that give us accurate data
for comparison within our districts and across our districts,
to make sure our children are learning what they need to learn.
Our state's teachers are very excited about House Bill 538.
I hear them.
They come up to me at home.
They're so excited.
But what they need is our support.
They deserve the very best tools to help them
serve their students well.
And I look forward to working with all
of our literacy partners across the state
to make sure this happens for our children.
Thank you.
Good afternoon, everyone.
Thank you all for coming.
Today, my message is that status quo in education
is no longer acceptable.
All of us should be concerned when we look at the recent
published CC RPI data that was provided
by the Georgia Policy Foundation.
Our scores here in Georgia on an average,
elementary schools are scoring at 75.9%,
which is a 5% decline since 2019.
Furthermore, middle schools are scoring at 70.8%,
which is an 8% decline since that same year.
High schools are scoring at an average of 73.5%,
which is a 6.8% decline since 2019.
Looking at all the scores, only 26.6% of our schools
are scoring above and 80% average.
Meanwhile, spending per pupil is increased by 27.5%
since that same year.
When my children come home with a grade that's a C or below,
I'm concerned, my wife is very concerned,
and we make sure that we do things differently.
Today, we're continuing to send a message
that we expect the Department of Education
and our school systems to do things differently.
We continue.
Literacy is one of the Georgia General Assembly's
primary priorities and has been for two years now.
Before I hand it over to Senator Hickman,
I want to speak directly to the importance
of K through three screeners.
And let me express why I think this is critical
to have the best quality screeners
that we can possibly have here in Georgia.
If you look at House Bill 538,
the most important purpose is the screeners,
providing the information to parents,
starting in kindergarten because we all know
early detection with literacy issues
or any learning issue with a child.
The earlier we catch it, the quicker and easier
we can have that child recover from that issue.
And we must not forget the important role of parents
and this empowers parents to understand
where their kids are.
I believe in school choice, as many of you know,
and our parents need to be informed
if their children are getting the support that they need
and make sure that they're staying on grade level
with reading.
And with that, I'd like to call my dear friend
Senator Hickman up next.
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator Dixon.
After Senator Dixon passed the House Bill
excuse me, Senate Bill 464 or before he passed it, I went to him with a friendly amendment
concerning the screeners.
We felt like it was very important that we are able to measure Chatham County against
Winnett County against Fulton County against Versailles County all across the state.
Very important to have one universal screener that all schools in the state of Georgia
used.
They can use other screeners in addition to that, but it's very important that every school
get measured against every school.
So we took this thing very seriously.
The President of Council, Scott Johnson, I talked about this a good bit.
He and I got an amendment drafted and we'll go over that in a minute too.
But before we did that, I went and talked to several of our senators.
Senator Tillery was one of my talk too.
I didn't read them, but he was satisfied with it.
Senator Dixon, I let him read it.
He was satisfied with it.
I went to Lieutenant Governor's office
and let them read it, and they were satisfied with it.
I don't think we can forget that in 2010,
our children were reading on a higher grade level in 2010
than in the world in 2019,
and then we had the pandemic.
We can't take this stuff lightly, people.
This is not a marathon.
This is a 100-yard dash,
and we got to take a serious, and we got to move fast.
As representatives of the ballroom said,
many times, this is a matter of national security.
If our students and children can't read,
they can't protect us.
That's why Senate Bill 211 came about
and House Bill 538 came about.
We want every school to use the same free streamer.
So let me talk a little bit about how we did this.
So this amendment that I sponsored, Senator Dickson signed it, Senator Hillary signed it,
Senator well the members of the Senate signed it.
This amendment addressed the issues that have arisen around universal screeners.
Now keep in mind if you don't know what a screener is, a screener is based a test.
So don't get a screener confused in something like that's a test.
Having multiple universal screeners makes it impossible to compare data from school system to school system.
This amendment remedies this problem
by requiring that all school system
use the free, free of charge, universal screener.
Systems, as I stated earlier,
systems may use a different screener
for other reasons, but we want every school system
to use the same universal screener.
We noted DOE is developing a free screener.
However, the screener will not be operational
if we have told until all of us in 2024,
And it's ripped into battle until you,
that's basically with school starts.
And her bill requires children to be tested
about that time.
We also do not know the reliability
if a stringer is being developed right now,
we don't know the reliability of that stringer.
We don't know it's gonna be beta tested, all that kind of stuff.
You know, you know, I'm an accountant, CPA.
We never develop our own software in today's world.
We depend on other people that have developed software
that had been tested and retested before we use it.
We also know that the free streamer has been developed
by a company by the name of CRDRC.
And from my understanding, our understanding,
DRC has never developed a streamer in the past.
So as the background of 538 required
to state board education to publish a list
of qualified streamers, the nation of board
provided 16 streamers.
And then we have to deal with the council,
have to deal center to do us to do a psychometric analysis of these
stringer 16 stringers and they basically graded these stringers from best
to worst.
So that's going to be after that the State Department of Education came in
eliminated three of those stringers, so now it's down to 13.
So what we've got if we don't drop this amendment and get this thing
through the house and then Governor signs it, there'll be 13 different
stringers used in the state of Georgia by all these different schools. There's nowhere,
no way of comparability when you're doing this. So, so the state board dropped it down
to three. House Bill 538 required the DOE to provide a free stringer by August 1. That's
in the bill. August 1, 2024. The same day that schools and districts must begin stringing
Institute. Our great governor, Brian Kemp,
provided over $5 million in the budget.
I've seen it in the budget.
$5 million in the budget is recommended for the DOE
to provide a free universal strainer.
The free strainer is not guaranteed to be available
until August 1, 24 by the DOE.
And it's not tested.
Additionally, this strainer of being developed
has not been evaluated for effectiveness.
I have taught in the Senate, we've got Senator Tillery's on the Council, Senator Dixon's
on the Council, Senate Estimates on the Council, Senate Sims is on the Council myself, and
I've taught all these senators on this before I drop this amendment.
And they believe that the state should invest in a known commodity, a cleaner that has
been analyzed for effectiveness, and one that is on the state contract winds up being
cheaper. We've got to announce on it that the
stringers that the deal center of analyze is actually
could be very much cheaper than what the deal we
is having to build. We believe the early estimates of the
top five stringers analyze the deal center will produce a
contract that is definitely less than a one being
developed by DRC. You know we always look at other
states as y'all we're doing and you know I hate to say
that but I shouldn't say that but you all y'all know we
We are now looking at how Mississippi did their literacy program.
Mississippi initiated literacy program years ago, we just did it last year.
But along with that, we know that North Carolina, a citrus state, thought this way from us,
uses one screener for all schools to test all children, one screener.
And I think some people have told me Florida does the same thing.
So let me tell you a little bit about the memo.
The memo is not very long, so it has the definitions or
including the standard deal center and the council leaders.
By May 15, 2024, the state board of education shall approve
the memorandum of agreement between the council and the Georgia
DOE for a free universal reading streamer, for use by public
schools and local school system, and part of their comprehensive
literacy programs, which meet the criteria of House Bill 538, by June 1, 24, now keep
in mind some people kind of got kind of freaky on this, but we're talking about
screeners that have already been developed and tested. So by June 1, 24, the DOE
shall publish on his public website, the Free Universal Reading Screener,
provided by the Georgia Department of Education, that each public school and
and local schools system shall adopt the Ministry in order to comply with the requirements
earlier this year.
Please remember that I said one universal screener for all the schools and then if schools
want to use another screener they can do that.
But it's one universal screener for all the schools.
In also the council in collaboration, collaboration, collaboration, the council in collaboration
with the Deal Center, the Office of Planning and Budget,
shall identify a universal reading streamer
that meets the criteria established by the State Board
of Education as provided by the Georgia
Early Leadership.
The Council, and that's the Georgia Council
literacy shall enter into a Memorandum Agreement
with a DOE to make such universal reading streamer available
for each free of charge to public schools
and local schools system.
So in this bill, it's got a provision, it's an amendment
that the stringer that would be recommended
will be a collaboration with the Deal Center,
OPB and the Georgia Council of Literacy.
And this amendment would be effective
upon the Governor's signature.
So I'm gonna now turn it over to Mr. Scott Johnson,
who is our chairman of our Georgia Council of Literacy.
Thank you, Senator Hickman.
And thank you, Senator Dexon,
for Senate Bill 464, which an important part of that says,
we're gonna support our teachers.
And the dollars they spend to support their classroom,
we're not expected to for them to suck it up out of their own pocket,
but the state is gonna support them for that.
And thank you for that.
We should do nothing less as Georgians and supporting teachers.
When I had the honor of chairing the State Board of Education,
I opened my meetings by saying two things.
One, teachers are my heroes, and I mean that.
And none of us would be doing what we're doing today
if it weren't for great teachers in our lives.
But also said one more thing, it's all about the kids.
It's all about the students.
That's why we're doing, that's why teachers
are in the classrooms.
That's why you're gathered here today.
And that's why last year, the General Assembly passed
to Bill, Senate Bill 211, and House Bill 538,
the Georgia Early Literacy Act, that ensure
that we're not going to keep doing what we've been doing
on literacy because we haven't changed
our trajectory in a decade.
So I have the honor of chairing the Georgia Council
on literacy with 30, a total of 30 outstanding people
on that council and a whole lot more folks giving input
to the work that we do.
Now, when it comes to House Bill 46,
me the Senate Bill 464 and the amendment that addresses the screeners, here's why I think
is important.
One, it doesn't supplant local control because districts can still use other screeners.
If you want to use multiple screeners, that's fine.
If a district has a contractor, wants to create a contract, they can continue to do that.
But it would provide one free screener statewide for portability, for comparison.
So we'll know.
So the General Assembly can know if what they gave us the Georgians the ball to do is being
effective.
That's very important.
It's our tax dollars.
And secondly, it's for informing parents.
Parents need to know where their child is.
You know, it's no longer, we've all heard the stories about,
you know, Johnny or Jane is not reading on,
it's not reading like they should be,
but don't worry, we think they'll pick it up.
We get data to inform those decisions.
That's what we need, and that's what we will have.
So, let me, so, and another important part of it
is the fact that this free screener would be available
to every district in the state,
and would be uniformly used throughout the state.
So if a child is in one district this year
and another district next year,
we can compare those results.
We can compare progress.
And that's important information for parents to be aware of.
And that free screener that would be determined, now under this amendment, by the Georgia Council
on Literacy in conjunction with a deal center on literacy on early learning and OPB would
be formative, it would address dyslexia and literacy.
would be universally applicable.
We need that.
And let me tell you a story about,
just before I walked up here,
a testing director for a school district in Georgia.
Call me and said,
Scott, we're worried because we got a train folks on,
if there's a new, if there's a screener
we're required to use or if it's available,
And we need to be able to train our people.
We need to be able to do that.
And I said, if this amendment passes, and we're able to see this, then we're not going
to wait until August, because there, you know, another option appears to be, or the plan
currently appears to be, we're going to, we're going to do this from what we're told.
We'll deliver the free screener in August.
And it's not tested.
not try it, we don't know what the psychometrics of this test is. That's not a good decision
when you've got other options. We have other options. We have screeners that are deliverable,
immediately. They have been through psychometric testing. They have existed so they've been
perfected and Georgia can provide those at a cost. I believe even less than the $5.2 million
that is allotted for them. We need to make good decisions. We need to support our teachers
with an early delivery of that so they can be trained and support our districts. I'm
about supporting our teachers and our districts. I am about, but I'm not about bureaucrats making
decisions that aren't in the best interest of our teachers and our districts and our citizens.
And I'm serious about the fact that we need to, we need to pass this amendment as part
of this bill.
I support it, and I hope you will too.
Thank you, and Senator, it's yours.
Well, I thank y'all for understanding our passion, and I thank y'all for understanding
our concern, and we appreciate y'all being here, and we will end the press conference.
Thank you.
You
