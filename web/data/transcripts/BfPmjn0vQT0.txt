TRANSCRIPT
----------
In the heart of Atlanta, a biennium of legislative work draws to an end.
The Georgia Legislative session, a whirlwind of 40 days, with a destination of a state hangs
in the bounds.
Here, 56 committed state senators come together to discuss a range of measures equipped with
the Georgia Code and an array of legislator proposals.
They have bark on their mission,
and the brick have gone to the fall of dusk,
pivotal moments shaped the trajectory of the peach state.
From Blue Ridge to Bainbridge,
from Mercedes-Benz stadium to the Oak of the Nocus One,
from the farm to the courtroom.
The impact of our decisions,
ripple, of course, 11 million residents
called Georgia Home.
In this arena of governance, ideas
I've put to the test and laws refine.
Don't only have our differences,
our shared commitment, the United States,
all to serve the people of Georgia.
For beneath this revered dome, we bear a duty
to protect the aspirations of every Georgia.
As the curtains close on this session, let us remember that our collective efforts shaped
the destiny of a whole state and the lives of its people.
