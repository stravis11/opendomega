TRANSCRIPT
----------
you I'm the subcommittee on law superform. I'm chairing the committee. I'll be conducting the proceeding today. We've got quite a few people signed up to speak today. We're focusing on the last two substantive sections of Senate Bill 68. I've got 18 people signed up to oppose and about eight signed up in support. I also do want to allow questions by members of the committee. So to avoid this going on quite as long as we did last nine, I'd like to limit each of you to about three minutes for your testimony. That's fairly short but just given the number of people we have to speak today. I think we need to impose that so we don't stay here forever. So we'll get started in just a second. Now, here in follow we thank you for this day. We thank the opportunity of us together here as we discuss important issues to everyone in this state. We'd ask for your guidance and directions as we move forward. It helps us all to do better. I mean. All right. Representative Evans, the Jewish to be our host. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just wanted to ask you to clarify for the folks that have joined us today that just like yesterday we're focusing on certain sections but we'll hear anything folks want to do. Thank you. All right. So let's go ahead and get started. I'm going to allow those in opposition to go first again. The first person who signed in is Kenneth Beseal. I'm pronouncing the last name correctly. Yeah. I'm going to ask you to clarify. Is it court? Crueville, you'll be next, sir. If you want to be just your own deck. All right. All right. Good afternoon. I want to thank you all for the opportunity to get up here and speak on behalf of myself. My colleagues. I'd be in practice as a chiropractor originally 25 years ago and currently served as chief financial officer for medical practice management company that oversees the daily operations of a large orthopedic group with nearly a hundred providers covering 18 locations throughout Metro Atlanta and further parts of South. South is making. I'm going to ask you to clarify. I'm going to ask you to clarify. Yep. Got you. So I showed this back on the emphasize that I see firsthand the challenges Georgia's face on a daily basis seeking out a health care for their injuries. Senator Kennedy has made it very clear in section 7c, Ains to promote transparency and medical billing so that of a plate of health insurance whether it be private or public to cover their medical bills the jury should be informed about those payments. At first glance this seems simple and straightforward. The problem arises because I believe the current language of Senate Bill 68 extends beyond with Senator Kennedy's original intent was. Specifically it reads regardless of whether that health insurance has been used or will be used to satisfy such charges. The language that left unchanged could lead to significant and unintended consequences. Let me explain why this is problematic. After an accident many injured individuals may choose not to use their insurance. The rebound is reasons for this. High deductibles and copays the need for out of network specialists who don't accept their insurance or simply the inability to find in network providers willing to see them. In many cases, especially individuals with public insurance, they face significant difficulty finding providers who will even accept them for care after an accident. Because of these barriers patients are often will exercise their federal right under HIPAA to not file with their insurance carrier. Instead they choose to seek treatment under what's called the letter of protection which allows them to receive care without a front payment with reimbursements coming later through a settlement from the app vault insurance party. This process often takes years. If it passes with the current language, it could force patients to disclose information about their insurance even if they consciously choose not to. This not only infringes on their federal right to privacy but also raises the question, how could the actual payments made by insurance carriers be accurately determined if no claim was ever actually filed? This will disproportionately impact George in his most vulnerable population. That includes the low income patients on Medicaid, the elderly, minorities who are opting for an Medicaid benefits children on peach care, veterans with their tribe care, and disability individuals that are utilizing Medicare as their primary source. These patients will likely find it more difficult to access medical care as providers will no longer be willing to see them under the financial constraints and they'll be left with no place to go to seek care for the musculoskeletal injuries and such but area hospitals. I don't think area emergency rooms can go ahead and tolerate that burden that will be inflicted upon them. If you're going as close for me. The simple proposed revision to the language striking the regardless clause, I think this will be the actual payments are recognized and it will ensure transparency in building without compromising the parents and access to health care for Georgians. In final conclusion, this revision I believe will preserve the integrity of Georgia's longstanding commitment to putting patients first and protecting their right to make informed decisions about their health care. This new legislation should not strip these rights away and then in an effort to go ahead and achieve civil litigation. Thank you for your time. Thank you, sir. You don't have any questions for this wouldn't? I'll see you in question. Thank you very much for your testimony. I appreciate it. I'm sorry, Kervilla. And then Dr. Robert Allen, your own deck. When you're ready, sir, go ahead. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, committee members for holding this chair. My name is John Kervilla. Can everyone hear me okay? Okay. Okay, thank you. Much better. All right, I had this great speech typed up but considering that we only had three minutes, let me just touch on the highlights. Okay. All right, so I've been practicing law for over 25 years and my practice includes plaintiffs work, it includes business litigation, some subrogation work, and believe it or not, some defense work. Currently, I see the practice of law from all angles. And considering this statute or this bill proposed by the Senate, that we are debating right now, considering this bill from all angles, it's not a good bill for Georgia. A couple of the highlights. One, the reason offered for this bill is that it will reduce insurance premiums. However, this bill is currently written, interferes with the work that's compensation subrogation lean. Part of my practice, when money is pulled into an insurance company, insurance companies use that money to offset the loss. However, the way section, the way section seven is currently drafted, collateral sources is admissible in a personal interaction. Work as compensation benefits are admissible in a personal interaction. And the way that affects recovery on the work as compensation subrogation lean is a jury is going to be much less likely to award work as compensation benefits as part of the plaintiffs' damages. And if that's the case, then the work as compensation and insurance companies are not going to have any remedy in climate-unfortance subrogation lean in the personal entry recovery. Again, unintended effect of the bill. But it is something that will happen, and that will cause insurance premiums to go up, not down. Further, because of the admission of collateral source, juries will be much less likely to award the full amount of the hospital's bill. What that means is that if the plaintiffs does not recover the full amount of the hospital bill, the hospital will end up not recovering as much of the bill. We don't want that here in Georgia. We want hospitals, particularly rural hospitals, to recover as much of the bill as they possibly can. And this will really affect settlement discussions, because when the plaintiff engages in settlement discussions with the hospital, what they're going to look at is not the full amount of the hospital's bill, but the amount that insurance will pay on the bill. And so if the hospital's bill is 100,000, and the insurance is counteract rate is 5,000, the plaintiff is going to say, you know what, hospital? You're only going to get 5,000 at trial. I'll give you 3,500. How is that good for hospitals? It's not. So the way that that language is currently drafted is not good for Georgia's. And I had a lot more to go over, but I will cut it short and just tell you a little story about one of the businesses I represent. I represent a trucking company, okay? And this is an example of how the bill that's currently written is not going to protect businesses here in Georgia. Currently, the way insurance defense works is the insurance company hires an attorney to go ahead and defend the interests of the insurance company. In this case, excuse me, will hire an attorney to defend the interests of the insured. In this case, the insured with a trucking company, my client, and it involved a death claim. My client had a lot of very good defenses to the case. Okay, I'm running out of time here, so I'll be quick. We found out that the plaintiff was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the injury, 0.06 blood alcohol level. And the plaintiff was cited at the scene of the accident. But the insurance company at the advice of the insurance defense attorney, when they had intended $2 million in policy limits over the insured's objection. What we need to do is give businesses an insured some control over how the defense of the case is handled, and as a result of the tendering of the $2 million in policy limits, by client almost went out of business through the increase in rates. But the way the bill is currently grafted that does not address this problem. That's all I have for now. Thank you. Thank you very much. Yes, Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for your work and bringing up both sides of the defense as well as plaintiff work. You mentioned that the hospitals would get less money, so if the hospital bill is, I think maybe in the example, we had $100,000. The insurance maximum allowables, $25,000. The patient paid five out of pocket. The insurance paid the other 20. Are you saying that after the trial is over, how often does the attorney group go back and give the other 75,000 to the hospital? Is that something you do all the time or just rarely are worth? Well, we're the vertical, we're the virtual hospitals. There is a special verdict and the damages are allocated by the jury. And let's say $100,000 is allocated to the hospital or the medical bills. Then the hospital can go ahead and say, okay, plan to be recovered to $100,000. You need to pay back, you know, $75,000 to the hospital, the $20,000 to be in the $20,000 to be recovered. So that's something you do regularly is to pay the hospital the rest of their amount over what insurance covered between that and their list price. That's something that would happen, would be much more likely to happen if the plan never recovered the full amount of the hospital bill or a full amount of the hospital bill. Well, right now that's the only number the jury is told, right? Right now the only number the jury is told for special damages is the list price today. Correct. That's why I understand it. And collateral force is an investment. And so you're saying that you always go and pay the amount over what insurance allowed up to the list price after the verdict if you win the verdict. Well, it's all negotiated at the end of the day, but my understanding is that the hospital has a much stronger bargaining position if the plan to recover more of the hospital bill than less. If you ever paid the whole amount, the full amount to the hospital. Well, I can tell you when I represented insurance companies, we have recovered the full amount. But you have recovered the full amount of the lane. I don't represent hospitals, but that is a flaw in the bill. And I do think that it just makes sense that the hospitals would recover more of their bill when the plaintiff recovered more of the bill. Maybe they can tell us later. Thank you. Thank you, sir. You don't have any further questions. I appreciate you coming this afternoon. Thank you. Thank you so much. Dr. Allen. And next up is Gordon Terry. You want to be ready to spring up here. Dr. Go ahead. Hello, everyone. I appreciate the opportunity to speak today. I will be brief. I am an audiologist and I work in a multi-specialty clinic where we see and treat mild traumatic brain injury. We are, as far as we know, one of the only groups in the Southeast that does this in the manner that we do. Obviously, as part of what we do with our business, we see motor vehicle accidents and other legal cases. For us as a very, very small business, less than 20 individuals in our practice, we cannot wait the time that it takes to have medical lean settled. On average, it's 18 to 24 months from what we've seen and been told. I cannot support the staff to be able to keep those cases in mind and have someone dedicated to managing that case. I wish I had the money to be able to do that out of the gate, but I can't. So we use funding. We use collateral source to be able to keep our lights on, to be able to keep treating Georgians, and to offer the highest level of care that we can. I also believe that with collateral source and the ability to have funding in Georgia, it allows me to be impartial. It allows me as a provider to do my job and have zero care how a case settles. In my opinion, with medical leans, if I have to hold onto a medical lean, you know, there is always going to be some concern that I have done my job differently to make sure that a case settle so that I can actually get paid for my work that is done. As a practice, we began, and actually today is our four year anniversary of when we opened our doors. It took us 19 months to get credentialed with medical insurances. We have to have a location, we have to have providers, and we have to be able to see patients. That was a long time, and we use collateral source. We use funding to be able to see these individuals while we got our credentialing taken care of and keep the lights on. At this point, we are happy to see all patients, regardless of how the injury occurred. We just want to be able to take care of them, but we also want to keep our lights on so we can continue to do the job that we have been doing. Thank you. I don't see that you have any questions. I know you're very busy and appreciate your time. I appreciate the opportunity. Thank you. Gordon Terry. Is it Shevin Polydora's next? That's from Terry. I'm Mr. Terry. Are you ready? Good afternoon, chair and members of committee. My name is Gordon Terry, and I'm the chief executive officer of integrity spine in the orthopedic and Jacksonville, Florida. I'm also a UGA grad. I had a privilege of playing for dogs in late 70s, and a team captain, and the 79 dogs in the Couch Dolly. So while I'm out here, I've seen this show. Two years ago in Florida, we went through the same thing that you guys are going through with Senate Bill 68. What was intended was lower insurance premiums, lower legislation. What really happened two years later is lawsuits haven't decreased. Insurance premiums continued to increase. It's been a complete nightmare and a disaster quite frankly. The only one or was big insurance who continues to raise the premiums. I see mine going up every year. Those that suffered the most were over 10 million under insured and uninsured citizens of Florida who lost total access to health care. The reason why they lost access is because medical providers were limited on what they could be paid in personal injury cases. And so therefore like us, we're out. It doesn't make financial sense for us to continue treating these patients. We'd love to. Don't get me wrong. The last week, House Speaker, Florida speaker Daniel Perez launched an investigation in potential deception by insurance companies. And I quote, he says a couple of years ago when this tort reform was coming around, the insurance industry came to the legislator and said without sweeping reforms, companies could not compete in Florida. We have since learned of reports not disclosed to the legislator that may suggest some insurance companies were using accounting tricks to hide substantial profits by telling us they were in a crisis. Please don't get wrapped up in big insurance. Self-pitch. You can't limit positions on what they get paid. Section seven as drafted will have a devastating impact on potential access to critical care providers in Georgia who treat these patients. And forces medical providers to wait one to two years to get paid if they get paid at all. They get paid typically at Medicare rates or some health insurance rates. And that just doesn't make financial sense for medical providers in and Georgia. It's not sustainable. It's not financially viable for any position. The impact of patients in Florida is lost access to specialized care. This is discrimination in its worst form. Here's what the resolution is real quick and I'll wrap up. Please strike lines 359 through 375. I'm going to say that again strike lines 359 through 375 in its entirety. What this will do, it will allow providers to be paid a fair fee, a fair fee. And it will show the jury the true amount of the satisfy the providers bill for what the patient owes. That's the resolution to this year. Thank you very much. Thank you, Dr. I think your fellow member of the profession has a question for you. Thank you for being here in the work that you got us do. I'm looking on there trying to find out where it actually tells a hospital or a health care provider how much they can and can't charge in this bill. I think that maybe Florida was different and I've heard of some other states that did put a limit of either Medicare plus 50% or some number of workments, comp or something. I don't see that we put that in here. Maybe I'm missing it. The way to read your bill is that it allows the defense to talk to a jury and say to the jury, well this patient who doesn't have health insurance, if they would have used health insurance, it would have paid X, Y and Z. Well, they don't have health insurance so there is no payment. There's no payment. Well, don't they also get told the total bill amount? Sure, sure they get it. Yeah, they get absolutely get told the total bill amount. And I look, I'll tell you that there are some there's some in Florida, there's some in Georgia to take advantage of that. And there's laws against that and those people need to be run out of town. I support that. Thank you very much. We appreciate your testimony. Is this this poli door? Yeah. Brand and peak if you'll be ready for the next. Is an ask witness. Go ahead, please. All right. My name is Shem and Pauli door. I'm the owner of Revive orthopedics. And I'm here today to represent countless patients in Georgia who stand on the edge of a precipice caused by SB 68. And really what SB 68 changes is is is really there is a there's a bait and switch that's going on here. Even when a patient never uses insurance SB 68 forces the court to act as if they did which can reduce their their their medical costs or the medical reimbursement to an artificially lower number than what they actually owed. So for example, let's say a patient has a hundred and fifty thousand dollar bill did spinal fusion surgery in an outpatient surgery center like mine and maybe they have some other ens鎚 treatment. So maybe Blue Cross would have paid fifty thousand on it. Medicare Medicaid doesn't cover that particular surgery in an outpatient surgery center. So they would have paid zero. So when you convert it to Medicare Medicaid it was it would be zeroed out. And then maybe the rest of the bills that they have maybe that gets converted to maybe two thousand dollars. So that's what the jury here. If the jury picks that lower number. Yes, you're right. The full bill can still get presented but now the jury has a two thousand and a hundred and fifty thousand which are they going to pick they picked a low number then then it puts that patient into a really bad state. People have come after their their home their their property. But worse what it also does is there are a lot of doctors will look at that and say well I'm not going to take that risk. It's spinal fusion surgery my surgery center cost me you know I got to pay for implants I got to pay an estate I have to pay this that maybe people have Medicare Medicaid I'm not even going to provide that service at all. People have insurance maybe on some of them I will and if they have assets with if the jury if they don't get enough recovery then then then their assets people could go after their their their assets. So this could cause financial ruin for patients who do get seen but it could also cause a lot of other patients who won't get seen. So I just did a quick survey of some other groups in town and I came up just in my limited survey about a hundred and fifty thousand patients who will lose access to care. But they are the people who do get care we're exposing them to medical bankruptcy and and and and other things if they do happen to have some assets. So those who use letters of protection who are construction company owners who are college professors that who may have assets and people could go after their assets. That's what this bill does and so really you know the other the other thing that I should mention is there are a lot of these people currently getting care who won't get care. So we have to fill up our hospitals. Grady are the hospitals going to be overrun. So so Senator Kennedy said in this bill that it fights fiction and the you know when he presented this bill but it just replaces one friction with another. A bill you know he replaces you know one fiction which he says is the is the doctors bill but another fiction which is what Medicaid would have paid when Medicaid wasn't used. So there are lots of treatment that Medicaid doesn't cover. So what does when I've showed a surgery PRP injection what's Medicaid reimbursed for that zero. Car practice zero all of those things will get zeroed out when this when this gets presented to a jury and I did my own informal survey of doctors in who provide this care. And not a single one of them saying it will provide it to Medicare Medicaid patients car practice and they will not. So this bill overtly said that we would take away care for you know non catastrophic care for Medicare Medicaid patients it would be cause a political of the evil so all I'm asking really is this don't let's not do covertly that which we would never dare do overtly unless preserve access to patient care and that's and that requires just a simple fix whatever is old is what's presented let's eliminate all the picture not just one fiction replacing with another. Thank you sir and to I'm assuming you're joining Dr. Dr Gordon with the fix he was proposing that which is yes yes and I think the fix is really very simple is this you know. Senator can be rightfully points out but it's a little bored that if a patient has a hundred thousand dollar bill but twenty five thousand is what they owe blue cross the hundred thousand is fiction they should be able to present fact but when no insurance was used he also want to impose a new fiction what insurance would have paid but that's fiction that's not what the patients owe and and and if for anybody who's ever been involved in collecting on this legal action to collect on on what a patient actually and I've been involved in the case where patient would make a decision. They're patient would make money they sell their case and they decided tell their attorney not to pay me you're going to court it's extremely simple the judge asked the patient did you sign this the saying that you were going to pay yes did you incur these bills yes did you pay these bills no judgment for the point easily so so you're you have a patient who owes a hundred thousand dollars but but may get reimbursed two thousand for Medicaid or twenty five thousand for blue cross and they still owe the difference you leaving them upside down that is what this bill does and it will result in two things. One is access to patient care you know so there's no money to go after a patient who has Medicaid so you're not going to provide that care but out of people you know could could be upside down I brought a patient to the senate named Betty who had and better insurance and she got eight years of treatment she couldn't find anybody to take her and better and so she ended up using a third party funding company got eight years of treatment and even though she waited for seven hours to to testify we had we you know asked her if she wanted to fix it and she got three. She said no, this is too important. And she didn't have any food or anything to eat. But she thought it was important because she would not have gotten that care. Under SB 68, she would be harmed. Senator Kennedy says nobody will be harmed. Well, actually, brought a patient in a wheelchair to the Senate who would have been harmed by this bill as currently constructed. But the fix is very simple. If Betty O's, how many ever hundreds of thousands, that would get presented. Don't present some fiction about Ambetter which was never used. Why do we want to, you know, talk about eliminating fiction and introducing fiction at the same time? That's all we're saying. Thank you, sir. I don't see you having any questions. Thank you for your testimony. Brandon Peake and then Josh Carroll was next. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon. My name is Brandon Peake. I'm a partner at Peake, Luton, McDaniel, and Caldwell, Alperman, and Columbus, Georgia. I'm here to speak in opposition of Section 8 of the SB 68, which is the portion of the bill that deals with mandatory bifurcation or tri-focation. In all civil cases, involving personal injury and wrongful death upon the election of a single party. Before addressing some of the practical problems with the bill, I think it's important to say this. Mandatory bifurcation or tri-focation in this bill only deals with personal injury and wrongful death cases. Doesn't deal with business tort cases. Doesn't deal with commercial disputes. Doesn't deal with land disputes. You're singling out a certain class of Georgia citizens. Those have been injured and the family of those have been killed. If this was good public policy, it would apply to all such civil cases. There are some significant equal protection concerns with this portion of the bill that we believe may not pass constitutional muster. But there are a lot of other practical problems with the bill. First and foremost, it's unnecessary. Under Rule 42, right now, a trial judge can grant bifurcation or tri-focation upon a motion of a party if there's a good reason to do it.

The only thing this bill would do is force trial judges to grant bifurcation or tri-focation when there's no good reason to do it. I'm glad Chairman Gunner is here. He's a trial judge, formal trial judge. He will tell you we have excellent trial judges in the state of Georgia. And one of the things that they are concerned about is saving citizens' time and preventing duplicative testimony. Y'all heard some duplicative testimony in this committee. And what judges are focused on doing is ensuring that citizens' time is not waste and you don't create unnecessary bureaucracy in trial. What this bill will do is strip the judges' discretion to run their own courtroom and force them to do what one party wants them to do because that party elects it. Third, this bill is going to inconvenience witnesses, which are your constituents, Georgia citizens. Take a garden variety car at case. I see the wreck occur. I see the person that's injured and go to their vehicle to ask how they're doing. And when I do that, I happen to smell. Then I go to the other vehicle to check on the defendant as well and smell alcohol on their bed. Under this bill, if one party elects bifurcation or tri-focation, that one Georgia citizen is going to have to testify three separate times in the same trial. Once about who ran the red light, once about the extent of the plaintiff's injuries and another time about potential evidential lighting deputative damages. In a trial right now, that witness can testify in 15 or 20 minutes, go home and be done with their life. So there are lots of other problems with this bill that I would like to address, but I would just finally ask that you consider what it does to both plaintiffs and defendants by forcing them also to testify multiple times. That's a traumatic experience, not only for plaintiffs, but also for defendants. Think about requiring a mother who has been in a wreck and lost her child who died in the backseat to come testify twice. Once about the wreck and another time about the effect that the loss of the child has had on that family in terms of damages, that's a very real reality of this bill. No trial judge with a heart in my experience would require that, but if it's mandated, that's exactly what's going to happen here. Thank you. I think you've got a couple of questions. I did not check. So you came up first. I think the chair lady Miller was first. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for your testimony today. I guess my question, and I think you touched on it a little bit, about singling out a class of Georgians to be treated differently under our code. As a lawyer who has practiced in various areas of the law, can you think of any justification for such a, I won't say it, but extreme overhaul of one area of the law without touching on the other areas. For example, jurors who show up for jury duty don't know what kind of case they're going to get. They may get a business litigation case, they may get a car accident case, they may get a capital homicide case. Why is a jury, why is a juror qualified to do and decide complex things in other areas, but somehow when it comes to car accidents, they are so confused that judges don't know what to do. They don't know how to instruct the law. They can't manage their own courtroom. Can you just tell us your experience in that regard? Yes, jurors are very smart. And before any testimony is presented to jurors, both the plaintiff and the defense have an opportunity to give an opening statement to tell them what the issues will be. The defense gets an opportunity to tell the jury before any evidence is presented. We're going to request a defense verdict because we didn't do anything wrong. And the jury thereafter views the evidence in light of that. After that, judges can also give a pre-charge to a jury, which says, you're not taking to consideration anything with respect to damages and lessen until you believe that the defendant has committed negligence. In business tort cases, those jurors would be able to hear evidence both about the tort that led to the damages and the damages that the businesses suffered in the same case without unnecessary delay. Jurors are smart enough to understand that I'm not going to award damages unless I found liability. They do that all the time now. There are lots of defense verdicts in cases where people are very grievously injured. And that damages testimony, I think, for non-lawyers, this is important. Damages testimony is often very brief. I mean, you're not going to put somebody up there for a long period of time to talk about the plaintiff's injuries or the loss. If you do that, the jury is going to punish you for what I call cross in the Baldwin line. So, you know, the idea that this is going to save time and efficiency is just a fallacy. But there's no good reason to treat them, definitely. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, something I want to ask you about a concern I've been having with this bifurcation and see if it's a concern for you and kind of if it is explained how we might deal with it. If we're going to bifurcate and we're going to have liability and then we're going to have damages, a simple view of the law is that you don't have a liability unless you have a completed tort. And from law school, I learned from Professor Sintel, Section T, that inside lawyer jokes, sorry everybody, here he didn't go to the University of Georgia. I'm glad he's not your question. Yes, it would be hard. But you don't have a completed tort, so you don't have liability until you have damages. And if you can't talk about damages until the second trial, how do you ever get to liability in the first trial? Do you have any thoughts on that? Well, I do and I've been looking at this bill a lot, obviously. And if you look at lines 394 through 398, which is the first phase of this mandatory bifurcation and trifacation, there's still a requirement that each defendant be at fault for the plaintiff's injuries or wrongful death. So we're still going to have to prove in phase one that the tort calls a specific plaintiff's injuries. So that evidence is going to have to come in in that phase in order to prove that this specific tort calls this specific injuries. And then you have to say, all right, everybody stop. Don't say the next thing, which is the effect of that. And we talk about doctors for doctors' depositions. This is going to be a nightmare. I mean, we all try to take doctors' depositions outside of the courtroom so we don't have to compel them to come and testify. So we're going to have to ask the doctor first in your professional opinion, did this particular tort called the plaintiff injuries? And then you have to stop and figure out how to present evidence next, which is what the effect of those injuries are moving forward. And so, you know, it just, it makes absolutely no sense to do that when the same thing could be done logically in a short amount of time. And for nonlawyers also think it's important for them to understand, after every phase of this trial, there's going to have to be closing arguments, jury instructions, and deliberations, which all take significant amount of time. Then you're going to bring the jury back for 30 minutes for the same doctor to give, you know, five minutes of testimony and two more people to give testimony. It's just, it's entirely inefficient. And the entire problem could really be fixed by, in line 392, removing the words, let by written demand and replacing those with file emotion. If you got a good reason to bifurcate or trifurcate a trial, you can file a motion and the judge can rule on that. All right, thank you. Thank you, Dr. Newton. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yes, on that, I mean, I guess that's the case right now, as you can ask, and be turned down. Right. You can ask for bifurcation and the judge can say no. Correct. Just say if you, if you request it just like a voluntary dismissal, we talked about it in an earlier section of this, if you request a voluntary dismissal without prejudice, then the judge, I guess, has to do it. And you're saying that's what would happen in this case is that if somebody requested bifurcation, the judge, after this law, if this law goes into effect, would be required. They'd have to do it. Yeah, it's bureaucracy in the courtroom. Two other things you mentioned, you did mention something about how you appreciate juries and how smart they are. I hope that applies to section seven of this bill, their ability to see the list price for services and the full price, paid in full amount that an insurance company or other arrangement might have gotten that talk. I appreciate that about juries. You did say to something about defense verdicts. Tell me in the defense verdicts, if we had bifurcation, wouldn't the trial be a little shorter? Not on how often a defense verdict happens at half the time, 10 percent? Well, in medical negligence cases, it's much more than that. So all those cases would be shorter for the jury, for the judge, for the court, for the doctor, for everybody would be shorter because you would never get to damages because nothing had been done wrong. Is that correct? In theory, yes, in practice, no. Damages evidence is often very, very short because you're not going to want to put anybody through talking about that over and over again. I'm only here to talk about section eight of the bill and not section seven as it relates because only had three minutes. So I'll let somebody else address that question for you. But in practice, honestly, it's not going to, it's going to, the difference, if you're trying to save time, the amount of de minimus time that may be saved if this bill is passed versus prolonging a ton of other trials. If it's passed, you're going to be creating much more inefficiencies in the system. Trials are going to take much, much longer. There are going to be less cases that get to trial because the trials that do exist are going to take longer to get through. I guess I don't quite understand if they, if we don't even get to the damage phase, then there's really not a whole, the patient doesn't have to testify about damages, long term, you know, whatever. But nothing really comes up. It seems like it for all that time and putting the patient through that, you know, the prosecution, but in your party for every one of those cases where you may save some time, there's going to be 20 other cases that are prolonged significantly. And the net effect is you're going to create much more inefficiencies in the system. And I just, trust me on this, but please check and ask a trial judge. And I believe they'll tell you the same thing. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And just to speak so that I'm clear in your years of practicing, is there any other place in the law where we have such a distrust of judges and their ability to run their own courtroom as you understand it right now? Not that I'm currently aware of, but you know, that may be a better question for the judges, but not personally, I'm aware of. I mean, think for instance, it's typical for witnesses to be taken out of turn. For instance, in a case where somebody has a death or a disability or an expert has to get back to wherever they're from, the judge has a discretion to take that witness totally out of turn and allow them to testify earlier in the case. I mean, situations come up in life. And this is just removing the judge's ability to independently run his or her courtroom. And typically, if you're talking about a business toward or a complex business litigation, wouldn't the argument be stronger in those cases than in these cases, which are oftentimes, you know, duty, injury, breach damages to do the same thing across the board in every single trial we have? Could we, I guess, is that can you see the logic of why a judge who can preside over a complex rico case or a complex business dispute or a complex business toward can run his courtroom, his or her courtroom efficiently without three trials, but something magically happens to a judge when it comes down to an injured party that they can't do the same thing there. And the logic, any logic that would support that? Not personally, in those cases are going to take longer to present the underlying liability, which if you're going to be really interested in time saving, you'd be focused on those rather than the garden variety road that case that can be tried in a day or two. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just a really quick follow up on Chairman, Dr. Newton's question about any savings we're going to have when you have a defense verdict. I just want to make sure you agree with me. The ones that we are going to drag out, the ones where we are going to make people come back and talk twice, maybe three times. Those are going to be the ones where the jury found fault with the defendant and that we found that there was liability, there was a legitimate cause of action that led to damages of those plaintiffs are going to be the ones that were dragging in and making them prolong their life to get justice. You agree with that? Correct. And the witnesses. Thank you. All right. I see no further questions. Thank you very much for your testimony. Josh Carroll and Jason Brant, you're up next. Good afternoon, sir. Good afternoon. Thank you for having us here. My name is Josh Carroll. I'm a lawyer in Macon and I'm going to be talking to the committee about how the collateral source rule would be applied under Senate Bill 68. I'm going to give you a hypothetical to put this language into action so I want you all to kind of listen along with this hypothetical. So let's assume that in January of 2023, my wife's t-bone by a drunk driver on her way from dropping our kids off at soccer practice. She's taken to the hospital in an ambulance. They run CT scans, discharge her with a concussion and some neck pain. Over the next two years, she gets just conservative treatment. She doesn't want to get a surgery and ends up she has a herniated disc internet. Okay. In early 2025, so we're two years later, her surgeon tells her her only remaining option is to have a surgery. She can't deal with the pain, so she schedules the surgery for the summer while the kids are out of school. In the meantime, her lawyer is preparing this case for trial because they feel that the drunk driver's auto-insurer is handling the case properly. What I think we're losing in the process of considering this bill is that over the past three years, hypothetically, we've gotten our insurance through my law firm's plan. Right through my law firm's self-funded heritip plan. In 2023, her portion of the premiums, just her portion is $6,708. 2024, her portion is $6,980. 2025, her portion is $8,000 and $2. So that's over $22,000 in premiums just for her portion from 2023, 2024, and 2025. Now, during that same time period for my entire family, we have paid over $62,000 in health insurance premiums. $62,000 in health insurance premiums. And like I said, this is a hypothetical woman. Thank God this isn't my wife and that she wasn't the victim. But these premiums that we're paying are not hypothetical. They're real. These numbers are pulled directly from my firm's insurance statements. I have the privilege of doing that for the firm, which is so much fun, but I did have access to this information pretty easily. So what I want to show you, and I'm going to do this as quickly as I can, using my good friend, Senator Kennedy's example, he's my neighbor and making his prior example of $100,000 in medical charges for the services that my wife would have hypothetically received here. Let's look at a really realistic breakdown of those charges, how they're paid, what's written down, and how all this would be used in court under Senate Bill 68. With our health insurance, our per person deductibles $2,500 per year. So over three years, that's $7,500. That's the pink portion at the very bottom. That does include copays or deductible or extra out of pocket max items. And I've seen what our insurance pays on larger bills, which is usually around 35 to 40% of the entire bill. So this green portion in the middle is what health insurance is actually paid for those services. And under federal law, because my plan is a federal or a risk of plan, we have to pay that entire amount back straight to United Health Care for those services. The last thing that I want to show you is that this top portion in blue here is what I've heard a lot of people refer to as phantom damages or trumped up damages. And that's just a misnomer, plain and simple. That $55,000 that's listed there is a contractual adjustment that I paid for. To have the right for United Health Care to give me that rate in that my hospitals and doctors I go to will charge me that rate and charge United Health Care that rate. That's the benefit of the bargain that I get for the contract I've entered into. One person who's not a part of my contract is the drunk driver, right? But Senate Bill 68 would give the drunk driver who caused this wreck the benefit of my health insurance contract. The last thing that I'll say is this spot on the very far right here. This is an uninsured victim. That's the person who doesn't have any health insurance. Under Senate Bill 68, that person is maybe in a legal immigrant. We're giving them more rights under this bill than people like my wife and I who pay our health insurance premiums and spend $62,000 over three years to have the right to have these prices. Thank you for your time. Thank you, sir. I don't know. I do see a question. I say to go ahead, Charlie. I'm faster than rep. I just want to make sure I understand that because this is an important point in my mind in the bar chart. The so-called MADA or fake portion of the damages, which is the benefit, which we get because you and your wife are actually paying for that benefit. That's what you have bargained for as the person who is paying for health insurance, correct? Yes, that's correct. That's the contractual right down. Correct. Correct. Why should, and I guess this is your point, why should anybody else who didn't pay for that get that benefit? Why is it that a tortfeezer or a person who has done harm get the benefit of you and your wife's responsible behavior and payment for it? That's sort of why folks in our camp refer to that as premium theft, right? We're allowing the person who committed the wrong to get the benefit of the bargain and the contract. The purpose of the collateral source rule when it was instituted was if there's going to be a windfall, the windfall shouldn't go to the wrong do it, right? It shouldn't go to the person who calls the harm. And that's what we're losing side of as we discuss essentially aggregating the collateral source rule in this context. We still don't allow the jury to hear how much out of insurance or how much liability insurance the defense has. Maybe if we did that, everybody would be satisfied. But that's not the conversation we're having. Thank you, Ruffian Mevins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for being here. Two quick points I want to follow up on. First, just insurance is a little confusing to me. I think I understand the charts. Under your example, you and your family have paid about $62,000. Like you said, for the benefit of insurance, you paid the premiums. And under the way that Senate Bill 68 is written, you have no chance to get that back. No, no chance to get that back. I think there was one draft that had some kind of premium reimbursement provisions. Some states have. I think including even Alabama, they have a premium reimbursement provision in theirs. I'm not saying we should model our laws after Alabama, but that is something some states do is they do allow you to recruit how much you have paid out over time. And then the second question I have is, and you started to allude to it there at the end. And it is currently the law and will remain the law even if Senate Bill 68 passes in its current form. That the jury, while now they're going to get to know that a plaintiff has insurance, they're still not going to get to know that the defendant doctor or person that calls the wreck that they have insurance. Is that accurate and can you tell me your thoughts on the fairness of that? I mean, I think if you're allowing the victim's insurance to come in, then certainly the defendant's insurance should come in. That's part of the reason that a similar bill to this was struck down in 1992 is unconstitutional. It reads very similar to the language that we have in this bill. And it was a question of, well, it's not fair to want to be able to put in the insurance. The other side, the jury's just sitting there and guess whether this person that's sitting in the defendant's chair has anybody there that's going to pay for what they are. So, yeah, I guess I don't think that's very fair. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I guess I don't quite understand one thing because the jury, my understanding under Senate Bill 68, they would see the numbers you just described, which is what your out of pocket was, what insurance paid, and what the total amount was. I talked about, I think it's in light and conscious of the jury. Aren't they able to look at that? And there's no prohibition that I know of. I can't find it on awarding you the 100%. If the jury sees fit to do that, all we've done is given them information. We've heard about how smart the juries are and they got wise defense lawyers and plaintiff lawyers helping them. So, if they decide somewhere in between there, if they won't, can't they decide to give the whole amount if your attorney makes a good case? Aren't they still free under House 68? Well, my question to that would be what in the language of this bill allows my attorney to make a good case for that, right? My attorney is not allowed by the language in that statute to argue that I should get the premiums I've paid that the defendant should have to come back and reimburse me for that. The other thing is that the defense lawyers are going to stand there and say, this is all their out of pocket. This is all their out of pocket. This is all they, that you should give them. Don't give them this amount. And if you're sitting there as the juror, what are you going to do, right? You're going to say, well, there's no way for me to pay their health insurance premiums back to them, right? So, I'm just going to give them what's there, what's out of pocket, because that's the argument that the defense is going to make. Everybody thinks that the plaintiff's lawyers are real clever and come up with these clever tactics. The insurance defense lawyers do that just as much. They come up with clever ways to pardon me, but screw people out of money. So, it just depends on what the jury buys that day. Yeah, but the bill doesn't give me the tools I need to explain to the jury. Why that margins there? You know, why is it there? Is there something in the bill that prohibits you from saying that to the jury? The collateral source rule that's still in the evidentiary code. I can't talk about the fact there's health insurance. The way the bill reads is we can put in the amount that's bill and the defense can put in the amount that was actually paid. There's no provision in there that says that there could be a breakdown of how all that's handled. In other words, that it was United Health Care or that it was med pay from the guy co auto insurance. All this does the way that this bill reads, all it allows is for us to put in the amount that's billed and then the charges necessary to satisfy that charge. So, the rest of that, that green part right there is the blue part. That's all lost in the shuffle. It's up to the jury's translation at that point because in that spot design, okay, I mean that's just the purpose of this is to save auto insurance money. I mean, that's it. They're the ones that are going to benefit from that, not the people in the order. Thank you. Jason Branch and Dan Snipe, your own deck. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and distinguished members of this committee. I appreciate the opportunity to be before you today and speak. I'm going to piggyback a little bit on what Mr. Carroll just talked about in section seven. And for me, the kind of the conversation was started and for me, the fundamental question presented by this bill is this. Is it fair for the defendant, tort-feezer, wrong-doer, the person that calls as an injury to somebody? Is it fair for them to get the benefit of the innocent victim's insurance coverage? Is it fair to give the benefit to the wrong-doer that calls the injury in the first place? And I think the answer to that question is a resounding no. I don't think that's fair and I don't think it makes sense. And for the last 150 years in the state of Georgia, Georgia law has said that is not fair, that does not make sense. In the majority of the states around us, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Mississippi, they have similar laws that we have now in existence and they say no, that is not fair. That's not the way it should be. I'll give you just a brief example to put this into context without the convoluted medical insurance. If I get in a wreck driving home to Columbus this afternoon and drunk driver crosses the center line and hits me and a trial of the case of trying to establish what's the full value of the life of Jason Branch, the jury comes back and says it's $2 million. I also say I'm a responsible hopefully father of three children and for my life I've gone out and gotten life insurance for myself and say it's $1 million. So the jury takes the value of my life, the signs of value, $2 million. The question is should a defendant should be able to come into that case and say well, there's the laws that's two million. Now the plaintiff went out and bought insurance for his wife and it potentially paid a million so your actual law is only a million. So therefore the drunk driver should only pay a million dollars. Does anybody here think that's fair? I don't think so. I think the answer would be it's a resounding note. So the very same principle applies to any form of insurance that an injured person goes out to procure for themselves to be responsible, protect and provide for their family and the events something happens to them whether it be life insurance, disability insurance, accidental insurance, burial or funeral expense insurance or in this case, health insurance. But this bill does allow a defendant wrongdoer to get the benefit of an injured party's health insurance that he or she is paid a lot of money for for the protection of themselves and their family and it allows them to do it for free. So the problem with this bill just briefly is we start treating plaintiffs differently based on the insurance that they provide. And most disturbingly and ironically the person who punish the most is the most responsible Georgian that goes out like Mr. Carroll and provides that plan for himself. The people who don't have insurance or choose not to have insurance are treated the best, which is a perverse incentive. We ought to be encouraging people to have health care one for themselves but to take that burden off the government and the state for having to fund those. The last thing and I'll just say this quickly and it's not talked about in the example that you get when you have $25,000 and actually post my benefit of my insurance, the does $25,000. So what isn't talked about is...

Well, what did it take to get there? And part of what it took to get there is hiring an attorney to fight an insurance company to get them to award that in the first place. So if there's $25,000 we're talking about, they're going to pay their attorney a third, so you're going to reduce that by $8,333. So that's left. What do you going to do next? Like Mr. Phillips playing. The playing is going to pay that $25,000 back to the United Health Care. So where are they? Now they're in the hole with a negative $8,000. And then you take the premiums they pay, that Mr. Carol's explained about for one year, two years, three years, you're going to further their outback. So they're in the hole. So now you're taking an injured victim who is mining their own business, who's injured by the wrongful conduct of somebody else. You're going to say go to court, get medical bills, and then they're going to end up upside down and in the hole. There is no windfall for the playing system at speculation. There is no incentive for them to even pursue medical bills. The only person getting the windfall is the injured. I mean, the negligent wrongdoers who called the whole injured in first class. Thank you for the talk to the one I put in. No, no problem. Thank you, sir. Appreciate your testimony. I don't see you having any questions. Mr. Snacks. And is it Denise Hoey? You're up next. Well, you're ready, sir. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman. I'm Dan Snipes. I'm an attorney in state for Georgia. I was president of Georgia trial art association five years ago. I want to start by thanking the committee. By my count, this is about the 11th hour of testimony that y'all have heard on this bill. And on behalf of GTA, we appreciate the seriousness of which the house has addressed in it. No 68. One thing that's being clear from the testimony, there's two things that are very clear to me from the testimony of her, these wet mouths. First of all, there's many businesses that are named as the Financing cases that are not very meritories. And those business have legitimate concern and any changes. And likewise, this testimony has shown that there's many people that have been harmed by the acts or the inactions of others. And those persons have meritories claimed and they deserve access to the court. Georgia's civil justice system and the justice administered by our judges in our jury is fair and balanced. And that's borne out by the fact that more businesses are locating Georgia than ever in our history. And if our court system was inherently out of whack, we would not have the massive economic development that we've seen since Governor Kimthing Governor. He's done a great job. One other thing. And that's low pass, which is a retired state court judge in the CAHD County Hamey Testified. And I'm sure Chairman Gunner will tell you the same thing. Our jury's get it right almost all the time. The same people that elect the members of this general assembly serve on jury. And just as our citizens make good decisions at the ballot box, they make good decisions when they were good at jury moves. Now, that in mean though that our court system cannot be improved. GTA remains committed. Punished persons and lawyers that bring clear wealth or who's trying to manipulate the system by using a plated medical bill. But likewise, as we just talked about, when a citizen does the right thing and purchases insurance, they shouldn't be treated differently than some of who doesn't purchase insurance when they present medical evidence. Businesses and property owners deserve clarity for when they're responsible for injuries for people that they invite under premises. But likewise, these same businesses deserve to be held accountable when they're aware of a risk of harm and they fail to take reasonable steps to protect their inviteees and customers from those risk of harm. F.D. 68 is going to change how 140 is going to change. If the evidence they bring is the four of those claims, how law is preventing these claims? F.D. 68 is not going to change or lower insurance premiums for any type of coverage, whether it's automobile, private or commercial, commercial general liability, often how the profit is going to change. What they try to use is the word stabilize. But a challenge. Do your own research. Google why are insurance premiums high or rising in Georgia? And you'll find out this inflation, it's storm damage, it's crime. No where is someone going to say that the insurance premium crisis in Georgia is a result of litigation. And then there's a private thing we'll look at what Florida does. Florida is one of the few states in the South East that has significantly higher insurance in Georgia. And I think you'll hear later, Georgia has more accidents than every state that touches us as it looks on the bill insurance. Florida's insurance rates continue to go up. If they stabilize it all, it's just been recently and it's not the result just of anything that has been reported. G.T.L.A. remains committed to working within the foreign work of F.D. 68 within each section of F.D. 58. I've got great respect for Governor Kim. I have great respect for President Procantinity. Many of the people that have testified in favor of this bill are friends of mine. They will remain friends of mine. We may have differences of opinion as to about what best for our court system. But we are committed to work within this system and within the legislative process to try to find common ground. And that's good for both sides of this and that will be well and we will continue working on that. Thank you so much. I see you have more of your questions. Back to you if you want to go ahead. Thank you Chairman. Just kind of a question. I think I may have asked earlier, Judge, too. Do you believe that jury can understand, especially with the assistance of a skilled attorney and a judge, they can understand two numbers when given information about medical bills? Do you believe that when they decide damages for an injured party? Do you believe they can be given information and that with the assistance of counsel can understand and make an informed judge? I'll lay that smart. I certainly think jurors are smart but I think your questions based on a false imprimous. And the premise gets into who should get the benefit of the health insurance that an injured party paid for. Who should get the benefit of the contract, who does the contract to adjust the bill, and should the injured party get the benefit of that or should the party that calls for harm? And we believe that the party that calls for harm should not be the one to benefit from that. If you can, is there a line you can get back with me on this bill that prohibits attorney from saying exactly what you just said? Because I can't find a prohibition on you making a very articulate argument or the earlier one in front of a jury and once again it's an enlightened jury. I hope they can understand you're making a very profound case. The collateral source rule has applied has been the common law and Georgia since 18 years. In any time a legislative body starts to overcome something that's worked for the citizens of Georgia for now going well over 150 years. I think you have to be very concerned about what are the unintended consequences of overturning the law to deserve our citizens so well. And I don't know exactly how this plays out but I'll throw back to this. In 2005 the last time the governor said Georgia addressed major changes in civil justice. But what's left from that is a portion of the family. And I would tell you that the changes of elimination of joint civil liability to create a portion of it is a big reason why we're having to address negligence security today. And that is an unintended consequence of what this body did in 2005. Likewise the change in 9.11.68 is something that was created to deal with people bringing cases in bad faith into punishing. But the reason section that we get right by this in the bill is because the plan for it is to use the 9.11.68 to the detriment of the finance. And that's another unintended consequence of what happened in 2005. But I would call to you to change the status of your law that works because you don't know what your election. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Schneibs just to quick question. So you talked about how long the collateral source doctrine has been a part of our jurisprudence in Georgia. Have you seen any data or specific information in analysis of how our court system is actually operating? That would in your mind point to the collateral source doctrine as it exists as problematic. Who's at a bad question? Let me fix it. Let me fix it. My question is why are we, why all of a sudden in 2025 is the collateral source doctrine so much of a problem in the way that we handle our judgment? I don't know if the specific problem that this is meant to address. I think within the concept of I think the governor is trying to address the problems that everyday do not proceed with increasing interest rates. That's what they're trying to address. My concern as this provision does not do anything to help average this. Mr. Schneibs. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I've been thinking a lot about this premium cost since the other witness and then Chairman Dr. Newton got up here or was asking a question about what keeps you from asking the jury about the premiums or asking them for the premiums. I think there's probably some issues with some of the other sections of the bill that might prevent that. One thing that I think is a reason it would be hard for a lawyer to make that argument. I want to see if you agree with me. When could the lawyer, when could the plaintiff ever prove that the insurance premiums were a result of the injury, which is what the case is limited to? They would have bought the insurance anyway. I think that's a problem in recovery. I was wondering if you would agree with me in answer to Chairman Newton's question. I'll first go back to what Mr. Carroll said. I'm not good at math, but I wouldn't have been able to handle the numbers part of this. But beyond that, I don't know that the jury would ever, I don't believe, would know what someone's been. I think what we're looking for is, though, there is a benefit that someone who has helped insurance pay for. That's a contractual adjustment. What generally this would do is allow a jury to give the benefit of that contractual adjustment to the party that calls the hall. That's the concern I have. What's good for the goose is good for the gander, kind of theory. Nothing in this bill. I think we've established nothing in this bill. Excuse me. It's going to let the jury know that the defendant doctor, that the defendant driver is not coming out of pocket. They've got insurance. Do you think that we have that in our law because we're worried that the jury would say, oh, well, this guy's not going to lose him. Let's give him more. Why does that not go both ways? I guess this is my question. The collateral source rule in my opinion is sound public policy. Jurors don't need to know the amount of liability insurance that's available because it suggests something. Just as they don't need to know what health insurance pay. Generally, the relative wealth of the parties are lack of wealth of the parties. It's not something that jurors need to know. They need to decide cases based on the evidence of liability and the amount of damage. That's what they need on the side. Thank you. Drilla, question. Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Stifes, thank you for your testimony. I would agree with you. I hope that there is an opportunity to find common ground on both sides of this issue. I'm going back to Chairman Newton's question. On lines 348 and on lines 355, it notes that damages would be limited to reasonable value. Specifically, I'm sorry, it's lines 351 and then again on lines 355. My understanding is that essentially if we're talking actual hospital, this would essentially allow insurance companies to pay out less than what actual hospital expenses would be. At least that's what this would permit. Is that not true? Well, I mean, even now, though, if a planet introduces a bill, a defendant can challenge the reasonness of the bill as not being either the incurring dispense not being reasonably necessary, or the fact that the bill is not similar to a bill or the same type of services in the same community. So there's already an ability to challenge that. I don't think that changes. It may codify it in a different way, but I don't think that abstain from changes what the law will. Thank you. Thank you. I don't believe you have any further questions. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for establishing with you and I share in common the trait that unlike Jethro Boedin, we're not very good at our side frame. Ms. Hoang, Melanie Manus is up on deck next, Ms. Manus. Ms. Hoang, please, when you're ready. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, committee members for having me today. My name is Denise Hoang. I'm an attorney in the state of Georgia. I've had a little bit of a different background than most of everybody else that's been up here. I am a Vanderbilt Educator Chemical Engineer. I worked in industry for a number of years. I then became a state home mom for a number of years. And then I went to law school at Georgia State at night program, so I could be home with my children during the day. Excuse me. And I've been a practicing attorney for the last 15 years. First on the defense side. Now on the point of side, I work with Pete Law and Mike Moran. You heard from Mike yesterday. I have two daughters. They are 22 and 23. They are one of them, a 2L at University of Georgia. So we've lived here for a very long time. We're ingrained in this community. And I watched the testimony yesterday all the way. You all had to be here. I watched it because that's just who I am. And I'm here today to take you back, throw back to Mr. Masterson. He testified he was your last witness last night. I know Mr. Masterson. He is a very skilled, very smart, experienced trial lawyer. He is probably the best negligent security trial lawyer, defense lawyer in this state. He came down here to give you an example of a negligent security case that survives this bill. That was his task. He had all the time in the world to come up with whatever example he wanted. He has defended hundreds of these. And the example Mr. Masterson gave you was, and I went back and I watched it again this morning, make sure I got it right. If somebody at Waffle House goes into the stall and is sitting in there every day, and repeating that conduct every day, and Waffle House knows about it and doesn't do anything, they can recover under this statute. First of all, this is not a real fact pattern. If it would never happen, the facts are, and the folks, the plan of attorneys who have spoken, have said, give us a real world example. No real world example survives this. That's not a real world example. Nobody, Waffle House is a small. Nobody goes in the bathroom every day and shoots or sexually assault somebody repeatedly, day after day after day, and nobody does anything. That doesn't happen. But even if it did happen, that fact pattern 100% does not work under this statute. And I, engineer, I want to go through the words on the page to describe for you how that is. You've got to start online 203, and owner or occupier here, Waffle House, shall be liable, and then it goes on for negligence security. If the plan of proof is online 207, the wrongful conduct by the third person that caused the injury sustained by the invitee was reasonably foreseeable, because the owner or occupier here, Waffle House, and it gives a couple of different ways, and in this, in Mr. Masterson's circumstance, you've got to go to line 218. Prior occurrences of substantially similar wrongful conduct by the third person whose conduct caused this injury. If the owner or occupier knew the person, the third person was or would be on the premises, and knew of such prior occurrences of substantially similar wrongful conduct. Okay, well, what does prior occurrences of substantially similar wrongful conduct mean? Now you've got to go to line 183 to figure out what that means. And when you go to line 183, it tells you that that means prior occurrences of wrongful conduct, and they give you some descriptions of that wrongful conduct. And then there's some conditions, and I want to focus on the third condition. They are and conditions. Means you have to meet them all, but in the interest of time, we're going to focus on the third condition. Lines 189 to 192. The wrong, the reasonable person, the position of the owner or occupier, must understand that a specific and known physical condition of the premises has created a risk of such wrongful conduct on the premises that substantially greater than the general risk of wrongful conduct in the vicinity. That means the bathrooms at Waffle House, standing alone, must create a risk of wrongful conduct. The bathrooms just are not a physical condition that creates a risk of wrongful conduct, and certainly not a greater risk than the other bathrooms in the vicinity of the premises. That cert that example just doesn't work. There are, as you go further through the bill, two other conditions you must meet. They're all and conditions to or three others. It doesn't make it under those either. There's more physical condition things in the rest of the conditions. You just don't get there. So even after spending a lot of time, and careful thought, this defense attorney who's done hundreds of these cases, could not come up with one single case to present to you that survives this bill. And as the other plaintiffs lawyers have said, that's because no negligence security case survives this bill. This bill needs amendments so that businesses who do not take reasonable precautions are held accountable to protect or to citizens. Thank you. Thank you for your testimony. I don't see any questions. All right. Let's see. We had Melanie Manis. John, tell me how, for not your last name again? Tange. Hopefully I can remember in 10 minutes or eight minutes to get her right. But, let's go ahead. I'm not giving you 10 minutes. I want you to. I don't need 10 minutes. I've probably been before the buzzer. My name is Melanie Manis. I am 40 years old, and I am a survivor of human trafficking. Last summer, I was in the Red Root trial case. You guys have done a lot in the past few years to try and help women such as myself and women who are still out there with no voice. In 2020, you guys passed the Debbie Vance Act, which I was the first survivor of Metro Atlanta area to have my record vacated, restricted, and sealed. And I never got to actually thank you, gentlemen, but thank you. Since then, it has completely changed my life. I become a business owner, a home owner, and to the best of my ability, a upstanding citizen. When I was in this Red Root trial, it was so hard to testify every single bit of it from beginning to end, because I didn't go searching for this. It was just kind of like it was judgment day, and it was my, and it was, and it was time for me to be given back what I had been stolen from me, and most of that was a voice. The time, a little bit of time that I had to get up on the stand and testify was really hard. I don't know if I would have been able to do it one, two, three more times. I think it's very, very hard because women have in the sex industry don't have a voice as it is. They're told what to do, when to do, how to do it, and if you do it any way, there are severe consequences. And to have to repeat that, one, two, three times. I was in a case with 10 or 11 other girls. Some of our girls couldn't even hold it together on the stand. Right is right and wrong is wrong, but for people who, again, don't have a voice, it takes every bit of courage inside of us to come up just one time and say, this is what happened to me. So how do you guys expect us to be able to do it two, three times, and to then to find anybody to be able to help anyone. It doesn't help anybody at all. The things you guys have done like the Debbie Vance Act have helped a whole lot. I really pray that you guys don't pass this because girls need a chance to be able to get it out once. Give them one chance to get it out. Two, three times. That's what I go to therapy for. That's what I use the blessing of my settlement for. I go to therapy. I go and seek out people who are able to help me to heal through the rest of this process. Thank you for letting me share. Thank you. You don't have any questions. Thank you for your testimony. Mr. Tonge. And is it Joanne Dorsh Shaw? You're going to get the name right? Yep, you're known deck, ma'am. Thank you. Please proceed. Thank you. I'm going to apologize in advance. This is difficult, but these are some questions that my clients have been asked to testify about. And all my clients are survivors of sex trafficking. Have you ever been defecated on? Have you ever defecated on someone else? Excuse me. Have you had anal sex? Have you had group sex with multiple men? If so, how many? Have you ever stomped on a man's genitals? What is the grossest sex act that you have ever committed? How did that feel? Doesn't feel good, does it? What if you had to answer yes to any of those questions? And what if the next question was, Well, tell me about that. Because that's what my clients have to be. And a lot of people have talked about, it's hard to testify twice. What about sexual abuse survivors? That's what we're talking about. And what if you had to do that two, three, four times? With the deposition, three phases of trial? I did the Red Roof trial. I examined Melanie. I examined other witnesses in that trial. Four of my clients. I had no idea the amount of preparation that takes. And it's not fact preparation. It's emotional support building people up to believe they can do it, providing them the tools. It's having a support system when they get off the stand. I've seen my clients testify in that trial last July. There's only 10 women that have ever testified in Georgia in a civil case about sex trafficking. And I've seen them walk out of the courtroom like this room, take a left down the hallway, turn the corner to where nobody can see them, and fall on the floor. And every single one of them is extremely proud of what they did. And they feel a great sense of relief. But the last thing you want to see when you climb the mountain is to look up and see there's another mountain right behind it. And another one right behind that. And so it, another important point is to talk yesterday about this exception that is already in there. That applies to a different article. So it does not apply to this biopircation thing at all. And so, you know, there is no exception for this for any kind of sexual abuse or sex trafficking victim. But there should be. And that's, I came back today because there's so much in this bill that interacts in different ways with my clients and my clients' claims. And this one would be particularly damaging to any sex trafficking survivor in the state of Georgia. Finally, I know we have short time. I watched yesterday also. I left a watch some of the video. The businesses that support this bill yesterday said that they don't want to protect bad businesses like hotels that allow sex trafficking. Everybody seems to agree on that. But that's what this bill does. And if the bill is not amended, it protects hotels that allow children to be sold for sex. And so if you're against that, then you need to amend this bill. Thank you. Thank you. One question, Mr. Evans. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for being here again. We talked to Mr. Masterson and some others yesterday about, you know, tell me a claim that survives. And we had plenty of claims lawyers telling us that no claim survive. The flip side we haven't talked about as much. Could you provide any insight on how all these conditions that now would, the defendant, the plaintiff would have to meet all these conditions. So the defendant knew this, the defendant had to do that. There had to be all these conditions. I think there's over 10 of them. Can you explain in a real world how having to have all those conditions benefit these motels that are allowing the sex trafficking to go on in our state? Sure. And I think I may have done a poor job yesterday, but when I say, you know, in this one section of a definition of particularized warning, there's 10 types of knowledge you have to have. For people who aren't lawyers, I mean, that means you have to have evidence that meets every single one of those. And so if you have evidence of nine of those things and you don't have evidence of the 10th thing, you lose your case and you're gone. Right? And so one of those is, you know, you have to know the identity, the location, and the time of what's going to happen. Right? So you have to know a hotel would have to know the identity of the trafficker, the location of the trafficking, and the time of the trafficking. And I'll just tell you, like I said yesterday, a lot of these hotels know a lot and they are criminally involved with the traffickers. But I mean, that means that if a trafficker came into the front office with a 12 year old, and he said, I'm going to traffic this 12 year old on Monday out of room 210. Well, if he decides, you know what, let's work the weekend. I'm going to do it on Saturday instead. That hotel doesn't have any liability because they didn't know he's going to do it on Saturday. So they don't know the specific time. What if he sees a buddy down the way because a lot of the not usually the only trafficker in these kind of hotels. What if he takes him to room 310? The hotel's probably off the hook because that's not the same specific location that they knew about. I mean, these are the, these are ridiculous outcomes that could come from this bill. And then the hotel could have all the knowledge in the world and if the date changes, if the location changes in the hotel, there's no liability for these businesses that it seems like everyone agrees we want to get rid of and wants to allow people to sue for that. But nobody's going to be able to do that if the bill passes as is. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This has been bothering actually a lot because I also prosecuted crimes against women and children sex crimes. And I know exactly what you're talking about and how hard it is emotionally even on the lawyers who do these cases. So first off.

I want to thank you for this work. The second thing I want to talk about a little bit, because I want your perspective on it. And I'm going to go a little bit to sort of the arguments that you all are able to make about damages and what you can say and what you can't say. For a crime like a sexual assault or sexual abuse, many people have a challenge really understanding all of the dynamics of the injury to the victim. What it does to them, we talked about it in the DA's office as holes in the soul. That's what we would say. What impact do you think it has on restricting an attorney from arguing within the facts and the evidence, which the judge is going to require you to do anyway? But making that presentation to a jury about what kind of justice or what justice should look like for a person who has been silenced with no voice. How important is it for an attorney to be able to do that? I mean, it's usually important because here, we're talking about something intangible. I had a client who testified in a criminal case, actually. And she testified very eloquent that what happened to her was the loss of her childhood. And a 14-year-old's going to have a very hard time explaining an economic number that her childhood was worth. And that's what happened to her. And that's what your lawyer is for. She's not supposed to sit down and do some math and come up with a number and be able to testify. I actually think it was 1.25 million would be right. That's what your advocate is for. That's what I'm here for. When she gets asked those questions, she doesn't have to object. I object. I'm the one that needs to defend her and say that. These are children that never got to grow up. And they need their advocates to be able to explain the process to the jury and to guide them through this. And sex traffic survivors need all the tools they can get. They don't need to be hindered or hampered at all. And that's what we're doing. I mean, that's everything that limits the ability of their advocate to speak for them is a harm to them. And it's only going to make it more difficult. I mean, the point of those questions and some of this stuff is, I mean, the point is to chill lawsuits. The point so somebody hears about that and they say, put, I don't want to do that. There's no way I'm not going to do that. And the point of some of those questions was in hopes that our clients would just drop their lawsuit because they don't want to go testify. That was bad. The deposition was so bad, so painful, seven hours. And when they all go seven hours, they take every minute they can take to abuse my clients and the deposition. And they just hope that they'll stop because it's too hard. And we shouldn't make it hard. We shouldn't make it any harder than it obviously already is. Thank you. I don't believe you have any further questions. Thank you for coming back and justifying today. All right, man. I'm sorry. Is it Doris? Doris show? All right. Come on forward. And Alex, whether be your own deck, when you're ready, man. All right. Thank you. Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to speak. It's really an honor to be here in Georgia. I'm from New York. And just a word about me. I am the executive director of the Center for Justice and Democracy at New York Law School. I am also the co-founder of a consumer coalition called Americans for Insurance Reform, which I founded along with Bob Hunter, who was an actuary and actually the federal insurance administrator under President Carter and Ford. We've done a lot of reports about the insurance industry and its relationship to tort reform beginning in the late 1990s. And what we have found in our work for over two decades on this is that when it comes to reducing insurance rates, tort reform has been a colossal failure. These studies, which are based on ISO data, which was an insurance data that was mentioned in the hearing yesterday, shows that there is no correlation between enactment of tort reform and insurance rates. States with few or no tort restrictions have experienced approximately the same type of rate changes as states that enacted severe restrictions on victims' rights. And what has the insurance industry's response been to our reports when we started to do it? Well, the American Insurance Association put out a press release saying, we never said tort reform was going to reduce insurance rates. And they are not the only entity in the insurance industry that has said this. Now, I know I have very limited time to explain why that's true. I'm happy to answer questions about it. But I also do want to talk about the jury system as well, because several of the provisions of SB-60 are direct attacks on the power and the authority of juries, sections dealing with bifurcation, and so-called anchoring, the premise of which is that Georgia citizens who sit on juries can't be trusted with information to assess damages by listening to both sides of a case. And then there's the repeal of the collateral source role, many have talked about already, which really completely undermines what the jury's decision, but the jury decides a wrongdoers liability should be. And by the way, in 2003, Texas repealed their collateral source role. Well, rates have been going up to this day. But one of the things that I always find kind of upsetting about discussions like this, and what I think it's lost is that the civil jury system, which is to be let alone without interference from anybody from the outside, it's one of the greatest achievements of American democracy. We fought the Revolutionary War in part over protecting the right to jury trial, whether you're right left blue red. It is one of the most popular institutions in the country. Decades of objective studies by researchers show them to be capable, effective, and fair decision makers who weigh evidence fairly both sides and reach decisions similar to how judges or juries would rule. So I know I need to wrap up. I will just say that you cannot solve insurance problems on the back of sick and injured children. By stripping away their rights, it's not only cruel, it doesn't work. I'm happy to answer any questions. Thank you. You have a question from Charlie Miller. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. There is one thing. And I've read several of the reports that you guys have issued over decades. And it really does seem to be deja vu all over again in every place where these campaigns are run. And a crisis comes to be with lawsuits, and then we have to enact or reform. One of the things that has been said by many people in this conversation is that Georgia is a judicial hellhole. I personally, as a lawyer who has practiced in this system and who has appeared in front of many judges and tried cases in front of many juries and seen justice served in many cases, most of them I agree with, even the ones I lost. Can you tell us a little bit about where this moniker, judicial hellhole comes from? Who has insulted this state by giving us that name? Can you describe that organization? Have you studied it? The term, it's a PR term that was developed by a Washington DC based lobby group called Americans for Torture Reform, which was formed in 1986 to represent the interests of large corporations who have a financial stake in restricting lawsuits. So they have put these out. There is no empirical basis whatsoever to this report. It has been debunked and criticized endlessly by academics, by experts, by journalists. And they just, they continue like the US Chamber of Commerce, put out bogus reports like this in order to pit states against one another to attack the independence of judiciary and to attack juries. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you so much for being here. I think you mentioned there in your remarks that you've studied this a lot and you've seen states in act, tort reform, and premiums don't go down. Why is there not a correlation to that if you know? And then more importantly, because I don't want our companies to have these skyrocketing insurance costs. And so I am interested in ways that would actually bring them down. So you could, could you speak to why bills like Senate Bill 68 don't work if you know? And then what, what should we be doing? If that's actually our goal? Well, one thing I want to point out is that insurers, as has been discussed here, they mostly make their money by investing the premiums that they get. There's a particularly true in the commercial lines where they can hang on to money for five to 10 years. And as a result of the way they make money, the profit cycle of cyclical rates will go up. They'll stabilize for 10, 12 years then they'll go up again. It's a lot to do with the side of the Byzantine way, the counting works with the insurance industry, which gets a little complicated. But in any event, it is not driven by lawsuits and claims. And what we always find is that the claims have never spiked particularly. When you have to consider inflation, then those sorts of things, but claims themselves are never spiking. So what's causing it is this profit cycle. This is something, it's a type of market that the entire nation experiences. Not just the state of Georgia. We are in what's called a hard market right now, which is characterized by high rates. Every state is experiencing this. It's got nothing to do with a state's legal system. The states that have been, a few states have tried to get control over this. I recall back in 2005, Illinois passed a very strong law, which was based on transparency, opening books, forcing the companies to report more information, and getting some kind of better control over rates. And during the years that that law was in place, and eventually it was voided out because of another law that was connected to that got severed. Anyway, it's complicated. But in any way, there were a number of years when this law was in place. What the insurance department found is that rates went down. Companies came into the state. Competition was increased. So all these great things happened just because the industry was forced to be more transparent and was forced to be more accountable. And that's, I think, the way to do it. That was because the legislature or the governor, someone had said, or the insurance commissioner, perhaps, it said we want insurance to be transparent, not because of tort reform, that the rates went down. Exactly. They said not because of tort reform, it was because of this insurance regulatory law. And one more question. We've heard in this committee, I think it was last week, or a couple of witnesses talked about this US Chamber report about the tort costs in Georgia, or just so much higher than everybody else. And could you shed some light on that? What's actually included in tort costs? And is Georgia actually really out of whack with any other state? If you could tell us about that. Here's another example of completely fabricated data. Yeah, they use inflammatory words like tort cost or tort tax to get people upset. If you read that report, what you find is that all they are looking at is insurance costs. So they are including in this all the multi-million dollar salaries of insurance executives, all their bonuses, all their jet planes, all the advertising that you see. They are trying to convince people that that's a tort cost. In addition, they're including things like repairing scratched up cars that these claims don't come anywhere near a court. So it's a complete fabrication. And again, just like with the Hellholes report, this report has been widely debunked. And unfortunately, they have a lot of money, so they keep doing it. And hopefully people don't pay attention to it. Revs and more. Thank you. This is helpful. And this sparked a question for me. So we hear about, we have been hearing about malpractice claims and malpractice insurance going up and all of these things. And we know that in Texas, at least my understanding is, and you can tell me if I'm incorrect. And if you know, that sweeping sort of tort reform that was supposed to deal with all of the issues that a lot of the hospitals and doctors and folks are saying now, and the tort reformers are saying now, what happened in Texas as it relates to claims or premiums in medical malpractice after the sweeping legislation was passed there? Right. So in Texas, the tort reform groups and the insurance industry got voters to vote, to strip their own rights away in their constitution, because this was not even allowed to be passed prior to 2003. They convinced their voters that if they passed tort reform there, that doctors would come back to Texas. They were fleeing Texas. And insurance rates would start coming down, et cetera. I mean, it was completely made up and fabricated public relations that was done. And they gave up their constitutional rights the legislature's past a whole bunch of tort reforms, including repealing the collateral source role, but others as well, in order to bring down insurance rates for doctors and bring them back and what this studies. And there has been a lot of academic work done to look at what happened in Texas. And what they found is the rates continued to go up. It had no effect really on rates. It had no effect on doctors. Actually, doctors were never leaving to begin with. It was fabricated. And to the extent that there's been any impact on physician shortages, the law of that law had no effect on it at all. I mean, there are a lot of reasons why we have physician shortages in this country. And I'm assuming the same in Georgia. It's got nothing to do with malpractice. It has to do with the burdens, the burnout, the difficulties of dealing with the healthcare system. There's countless articles that you see about doctors writing. I can't take it anymore. I'm leaving the profession. They're leaving younger than they used to. Or also a lot of retirement, there's a lot of retirement not being replaced. There's so many reasons. And if you look at the surveys of doctors that are done, they actually list malpractice at the very bottom of the list. If it's even on the list, it is not, we have plenty of studies and surveys about this, which I'm happy to supply. But basically, with regard to Texas, people lost their rights. They were completely taken away from them and had no effect whatsoever on the medical malpractice market. What mark? Thank you, Mr. Chair. What's happening in Florida? I know there's prior testimony given that after a tour of four past two years ago or so that truck insurance rates went down. And then now of course, here's a current investigation by the Republican speaker. Could you enlighten us a little bit more there? Yeah, I mean, we all know about the scandal in Florida. We've heard about this. How the industry hid data. They hide data on all kinds of ways, which is as another, an additional conversation. I think what's happening that the state is under enormous political pressure right now that insurance industry is, there's a microscope on them. And they're going to slightly reduce rates perhaps. But what we know will happen is the student is nobody's looking. Those rates are going to go way back up again. And we're already hearing insurance. Auto insurance is talking about how the tariffs are already causing them to raise rates. There are a lot of other factors happening. It's not, there's no connection to the tour reform law. And I think you have to sort of step back and look at what has actually happened around the country to every state that is. And I will say one more thing about Florida. We have a very short memory. In this country, back in the early 2000s, Florida passed a bunch tour of forms that were later found unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. And if you read that decision, the Supreme Court went after the insurance industry for misleading, basically, the lawmakers as to what would happen if these laws were passed. And in fact, at one point, I know that a lot of representatives in Florida were put under oath at the time. And if I could just quote from one of the excerpts from the Supreme Court decision, quoting Robert White, the president of first professionals insurance company, testified during Senate Judiciary Committee meeting that tour reform would achieve virtually nothing with regard to stabilizing medical malpractice insurance rates. And the entire Supreme Court decision was quoting people like this. And as a result, they struck it down. They struck the tour reform down as having no rational relationship to the arguments that were being made in favor of it. Thank you, ma'am. You know how many further questions? Mr. Weatherby? And David Steele is on deck. All right. My name is Alex Weatherby. I'm an attorney in Atlanta. For 14 years, I was an insurance defense lawyer until last year. So now that I've come to the dark side, I can actually tell you a little bit about what the defense side was. So for 14 years, we defended the largest companies in the world. And what we called nuclear verdicts were actually called outlier verdicts. That's how we would talk about them. Because when you graphed them out, they were an outlier. The reason why they were an outliers, because they were uncommon. They didn't happen very often. At my law firm, we defended 7,000 of these cases. I know because we started at file number one and kept going. Out of those 7,000 cases, we had zero outlier verdicts. We had two settlements over $1 million. One was to a man who was on the way to his child's baby shower with a present next to him. We pulled out in front of him and killed him. The second was a person who we pulled out in front of again and was paralyzed completely on the right side of his body. No way would anybody in this room exchange the amount of money for what these folks went through. The outlier verdicts are uncommon. They're also often uncollectable. The vast majority of what you see out there posted on attorney's websites are uncollectable. I know because I have one on my own site. OK, it's a $27 million verdict I got at the Fulton County Courthouse. What happened in that case is Tom's wife, Pam, was picking up their son, Christian, from a soccer field about half a mile away. And a drunk driver who was underage had been getting drunk at a bar. A bar we later found out made their money on serving underage people and not ID in them at the door. T-bone, the car, Pam dies instantly. Christian crawls over his mom, kicks out the door, and survives. So they awarded us $27 million. Now, even though it was uncollectable, that doesn't mean it didn't matter. That bar is no longer in existence. And everybody here is better off. Many of the folks in this room will actually drive right by where the accident happened. I mean, it was literally half a mile down the road, and they were continually putting drunk drivers. So mad, mothers against drunk drivers, is right. If we didn't have, if we had this law, that judgment would not have happened. And why? Well, one of the main reasons is that you can't argue pain and suffering until the end. Well, in Pam's case, she died on the scene. I mean, I think the medical bill was about $1,500 to take her to the corner. So there was no real special damage. It was all about what Tom's life were, the fact that he's still not married 10 years later. What's that worth? The final thing is my final thing here is that it's explainable. When you look under the results of any of these outlier verdicts, and we've heard a lot about them today, and yesterday, these are not my dad's plumbing company. They're not employing 10 good old guys who are going out and doing good work. There are people who are doing shady things, and they do it in the courtroom and out. And that's why I understand you have a judge, a former judge up here. That's one reason I wanted to bring up, which hasn't been mentioned today, the motion to dismiss component, the folks that are most likely to take advantage of the fact that our state courts are overworked, are these bad acting defendants like that bar that killed Tom's wife. They'll file a motion to dismiss. It will be pending for years. We already have a requirement that all motions be ruled on within 90 days. It's OCJA 15621. It doesn't happen. As the judge will tell you guys, it doesn't not because they're not good judges, but because they aren't able to get to it. They just have way too much to do. You'll have cases pending families that are trying to get over a loss for a year. Thank you. I don't see any questions. Thank you for your testimony. David Stiegel. And then next up is Ginger. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. And David Stiegel, I'm principal consultant at the risk management in RCS, risk consulting and in risk management. We're an insurance consulting firm. Started this firm in 2007. After 30 years, I was originally trained as an ethno-casual insuredy underwriter, went on to be an agency owner, and a reinsurer in an insurance company executive. After all these jobs, although not a very good resume to get hired again, it was an excellent resume to become an expert, an insurance expert. I was called by the Florida, I mean the Georgia Triall Lawyers Association several months ago to do a report on to study the Georgia insurance market and come to findings based on a lot of empirical data that we gathered through the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which is the body by which the insurance commissioners offices of all of the states send to this organization to do analytical studies. Georgia's commissioner office sends this information along with all the others. So there's no question of what facts I'm using, we're all using, should be using the same facts and that's what we're coming from. The highlights of my findings were that the Georgia insurance market is stable, competitive and profitable to the insurance industry. Attorney involvement is not the cause of high premiums. The number one cause of high premiums is that Georgia has almost two times as many accidents as the average of the United States, actually 190% to be exact. Inflation and the increased auto part prices are the other contributing factors. Carriers are not fleeing the Georgia insurance market as some have said. In the report from 2017 to 2023 markets did leave the market, but 21 carriers came into the market too. So that wouldn't call that a mass fleeing of the market. Georgia also has a profitable insurance market, believe it or not, all the insurance industry sources simply give you underwriting information called loss ratios, which is basically losses divided by premiums. And only four years out of the last 40 had they had a profitable underwriting period. So that is obviously not where the insurance companies make their money. It's from investment income. Prince, that's in 2023, the total insurance industry in the US had a 102% loss ratio. So they spent $2 more at a very hundred, if they collected 100 in premium, they spent 102 in losses, which doesn't sound good, but they made 90 billion in investment income. So that has to be taken into consideration and it is by insurance company executives when they're determining rates and market share and other things that they determine about how they're gonna operate in a particular market. I think my time is up. Your time is up, but I'll get you as close. Pardon? I was just, also Commissioner King issued a report that I was asked to rebut on. He used a lot of information that he said was proprietary and didn't say exactly where it came from. I didn't know that insurance company dated with the proprietary, but what it's apparently came said was policyholders seldom recover full indemnity on physical damage claims without an attorney involvement. Also there was people were saying that attorney advertising increased print in premiums. Well, when asking a survey, only 13% of the survey, people said that that was why they called an attorney. 87% had several, eight, nine different reasons why they did. The other thing is that the King report also mentioned numerous times nuclear verdicts. I couldn't, I didn't find one from 2014 to 2023. Thank you very much. I don't see you have any questions. I appreciate your testimony. All right, Senator Jordan and late more is next. Good afternoon, I'm gonna be quick, gentlemen. My name is Jen Jordan. I'm a former state senator. I've served with some of y'all, but more significantly I'm a lawyer. I have practiced for, unfortunately, about 25 years. I've represented both defendants and plaintiffs and I still do.

and let me tell you something with respect to this bill, the only people who benefit are insurance companies and insurance defense lawyers. And let me tell you why. Specifically, when you are a business or if you are a defendant in a case, let's talk to take a medical malpractice case. You're a doctor, you've been sued, it is stressful, right? It is incredibly stressful, you want to get it done. All this does is it delays the process by years, okay? So I come in here, I'm looking at this, I'm like, well this isn't just a pro-defendant bill, right? Or a pro-plane of bill because it hurts both. Who the heck is benefiting here in terms of the delay that this puts into the process, right? It's the insurance companies. And specifically when we look at with respect to the evidence and the testimony that's been given, that what about this whole profit cycle that they're in? Look, insurance companies want to hold on to their money as long as possible, right? They put it into the markets, it's a five-year, 10-year kind of horizon. They don't care if the defendant doctor is sitting there and wants to settle, right? The process is completely shut down, completely delayed. And at the end of the day, the only people that get hurt are actually the parties, the judge, who are taking away a lot of power from, right? And the jury's in this state. And let's be clear, the jury system is so incredibly important. It is a conservative concept in that we don't want the government coming in and telling us what to do. We don't want regulation. What we do want is we want the people in our communities to be able to say this is right or this is wrong. And as between the innocent person who's been injured and the wrongdoer, who should have to pay for that? It absolutely should be the wrongdoer. This is a travesty and this is being pushed by an industry that sees record profits and the only people again that are going to be hurt are the people that elected you to be here. Thank you very much. Thank you. I'll see who's next. I'll lay more and then Morgan knows is next. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, with honorable members. I'm going to speak to Section 7 and specifically to the application of that section to future damages. Current law permits a plaintiff to prove and recover the face amount of the medical bill. Evidence of whether they have health insurance, but what amount that insurance will pay, is excluded just like the evidence of a defendant's liability insurance is excluded. And there are good reasons for that. On the defense side, the worry is the jury will award more if they think the insurance company is going to pay it. On the plaintiff side, the concern is, one concern is, the jury is going to award less if it believes the plaintiff's insurance company will pay for future pay. This bill changes that in a way that only benefits tortfeezers and their insurance company. The supporters of the bill refer to the difference between the face amount and the discounted portion as phantom damages, but it's not. When the plaintiff has to go collect those damages in a lawsuit, they have to hire a lawyer to do that. And most people can't pay a lawyer by the hour of the way an insurance company can. They have to pay a contingency fee. So that comes out of the amount that's awarded. If the amount that's awarded is only the cost of care, minus what it's being referred to as phantom damages, then the attorney's fees come out of that cost of care and the money's not enough. But without the attorney, the money would never have been awarded in the first place. And then many plaintiffs have to pay their insurance companies back. And as Mr. Carroll pointed to this, especially if they are ensured by Medicaid, if they're a service member ensured by try care, if there's a self-funded or risk of plan, like Mr. Carroll's plan. And for future care, there can be Medicare's set-asides and Medicaid's set-asides that are mandated by federal law. Some insurers don't have the right to get paid back. They're subject to what Georgia law calls the Made Whole Rule. The rules that govern this repayment are very complex. And many lawyers don't understand them. Rules like subrogation or the enforceability of hospital limbs. And the legal system is the most complex federal statute there is. Secondary payer acts for Medicaid, try care, Medicare. Lawyers like myself hire specialized attorneys to address these issues. Because we frankly don't understand all the ins and outs. And for future medical care, we hire specialized lawyers to set-up special needs trusts for permanently injured plaintiffs who are going to need medical care for the rest of their life. The facts that are necessary to determine whether the insurance company will need to get paid back aren't always known at the time of trial. Often there's separate declaratory judgment actions or because the care hasn't been provided yet, the facts aren't fully developed. If the awards too low, the plaintiff can't come back to the jury a second time. The plaintiff can't come back. So the money runs out and what happens then when a plaintiff is permanently injured to no longer work and still needs medical care, taxpayers take that money out. Taxpayers start paying for it through Medicare and Medicaid. The facts, the only practicable thing to do, I'm cutting to the chase, is to let the jury determine how much the needed medical care costs and not try to speculate on how it will get paid for. That's current law and that's the right fix, especially as to pay. We can't predict if the plaintiff is even going to have health insurance in the future. Whether Obamacare will get repealed, whether Medicaid will get cut, reimbart the reimbursement rates will be. There's no way to predict that from the standpoint of 12 people in the jury cost. So section 7 is not good for any case, but if anything like it is going to pass, it should be amended and restricted to past medical costs and not future. Thank you. Have a question from Rick and Miller. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for that. That was actually a good point and I just want to make sure I understand what you're saying. If the, is the fear that if a jury hears about health insurance, that an injured person may have, that they will diminish the value of future care because they will be, they will be led to believe that insurance will cover it. Is that what you're saying? So my understanding of the way section 7 works is that if the plaintiff has health insurance, the charges for medically necessary care treatment or services shall be the amount the insurance company pays. And you don't know what that's going to be in the future. There's absolutely no way to predict that. If the plaintiff has Medicaid, you don't know what Medicaid reimbursement rates are going to be. If the, if the plaintiff has private insurance, you don't know if they're still going to have it. You don't know if the pre-existing condition exclusion from a bomb of care is going to get changed. And so what are we supposed to do as trial lawyers? Are we supposed to hire political scientists and historians to come in there and predict the future course of the law? Or health policy experts to say what, what insurance rates are going to be 50 years from now when a baby's got a brain injury and you're trying to provide for them for the rest of their life. And on the day when that money runs out for that baby, that's when taxpayers start taking over in the tort fees or stops paying. And so that's what we're trying to prevent. In fact, you have no further questions. Thank you. All right. Morgan Knowles. And those of you who are the last opposed to witness and after you will take a quick break for about five minutes and come back in and take up those in support. Please go right ahead. Thank you for taking the time to hear me out. My name is Morgan Knowles. In 2018, I was seriously injured in a really bad car wreck on 285 after I was re-rended by two different individuals. This happened just four months after I lost my fiance to suicide. I was a newly-single parent trying to navigate a world that I struggled to navigate. And then I was thrown into the world of lawsuits and tort. It was an incredibly difficult journey. I learned very quickly that I was not allowed to even talk about my insurance company when it came to being a trial. So both of the two individuals who had hit me, their insurance carriers, that actually paid out their limits. So it was up to my insurance company to cover the cost for the remaining medical bills that I had, which was an excess of $35,000. My insurance company told me no, that they would offer me $0. So I had to file a suit. I could not name my insurance company in that suit. They basically got the hide behind a veil. But in fairness, my health insurance wasn't to be disclosed there, but Senate Bill 68 takes that away even. So the skills were already tipped in favor of tort-peasers. And what Senate Bill 68 does is allows these tort-peasers and their insurance companies to now introduce other insurance information while still hiding behind that same veil that they hid behind with me. And that just doesn't sit right with me. I was a Jordan just going to work. I'm just like all of you. There's nothing special there, but it was hard enough for me then. I cannot even imagine trying to navigate it after Senate Bill 68. So I kindly ask you to please look at the bill. Please look at the implications for the regular just normal Georgians like I am. Thank you. Thank you. I don't see you. Do you have any questions? Thank you for your testimony. All right, ladies and gentlemen, we'll take a five-minute break and then we'll get back here and try to get wrapped up. Thank you. You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You From My Son From His Son From My Son From His Son From His Son From He All right. All right. Brett Johnson in the room. Mr. Johnson, want you to go ahead and get us started. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Committee. Thank you, Bruce, for doing the day. For Senate Bill 68, as well as what I'll do every day. For the citizens of George to make this place a better state to live and work. I'm Brett Johnson, a founder and CEO of Vertical, who are civil and construction, transportation construction company, and a fitted business for 28 years. I reside in Forsyth County. We have about 600 plus employees in both Forsyth and Effingham counties and also Dan and Florida. In the spring of 2023, one of our low-boy trucks and trailers was transporting equipment across the top in the 285 near the intersection of George to 400. If you remember back at that time, that intersection was under construction. And the traffic that day, like most days, moved more like a fast food drive in than actually an interstate. So our truck was easing along through that area. Another car merged in front of our truck at the low speeds. From the dashed-cam footage, it's hard to tell that there actually was a collision. We don't know exactly when it was, but apparently those two vehicles touched my truck and that other car. The driver of the other car flagged down our truck and I motioned over to the side. They called the police. Police wrote up a report. No injuries at the scene. Both cars drove off and that was the end of it that day. In the coming weeks, we received a damage estimate for the car for $4,589. Relatively spalled by today's standards. And our carrier processed the claim. Six months afterwards, we received a demand letter at our office. I was surprised to read that the attorney demanded we immediately paid $540 million. Nine figures, for an instant, that didn't involve any injuries at the time of the collision and the car could be driven away. It could possibly argue the collision was actually caused by the other car, and this is 120,000 times X of what the actual damages were to the car. For whatever reason, our societies would come to be since these large numbers and they're very commonplace. We don't operate a billion dollar company and we cannot purchase excess coverage anywhere near these limits at any price nor we should really need to. With this type of risk, we're forced to make this decisions about which counties we work in, which type of projects to pursue and whether it even attempt expand services to our clients because these increased risk. And this type of minor action could be the end of our, entire company, it loves the careers of all 600-bar employees. Regardless of how this claims actually resolved, the fact that it was ever levied in any amount has caused hundreds of hours of our time and our staff over the two years it's already lingered here. Placed increased reserves on our insurance policies and cost my insurance policies to increase in value, which I then have to pass along to our customers, one of which is the Georgia Department of Transportation. I agree and appreciate the need to allow everyone access to justice. Unfortunately, the scales of tip to point these outrageous demands are not billified by commonplace and actually celebrated on billboards and websites. And instead, a danger to the careers of all of our employees and our entire company. I urge you to pass Senate Bill 68 is currently written and also provide justice for all of our hardworking employees and their families. And just pretty good timing. Well, you timed your comments perfectly. Thank you, you have no questions. Thank you, sir. And you've got these materials for us to hand up to committee members. Right, Deborah Moses and Zach Matthews, your own deck. Good evening, Mrs. Moses, when you're ready. Thank you so much. I appreciate the opportunity to be here. I am Deborah Moses. I'm the Chief Risk Officer for Feedmont Healthcare. And my comments today will really be focused primarily on professional liability, both claims litigation and the insurance implications arising from that. I will tell you while I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, won't spend time talking a lot about Feedmont. I'll hope that you'll, you'll have some appreciation for our status in the state, but we do employ over 40,000 Georgians and approximately 80% of Georgians get some degree of care from Feedmont Healthcare. So what's good for Georgians? Georgians is important to us. We take a lot of pride in our, the quality of the care that we provide, having said that, we recognize that from time to time errors occur. And they're in the risk area, I think we have two jobs to do whenever that occurs. First, we need to learn from it. We need to understand why it happened. And we need to take steps to prevent future harm. And then the second thing we need to do is make it right with the patient and or their family. And we're committed to that. And that's why I've spent over half of my professional career with Feedmont Healthcare because of that commitment to do the right thing. We remain committed to do that, but I will tell you, it's harder and harder to do the right thing because of the unfair litigation process that we have in Georgia. And I want to explore that just a little bit. I'm here specifically to talk about phantom damages. I think that's a key to the unfair situation we find ourselves in. It's been pretty well discussed today, and but I'll repeat that under current Georgia law, patients can put a medical bill in front of a jury and act as if the full bill was paid even when that is a fallacy. And it is always, frankly, a fallacy. And we've heard a lot about collateral source and getting the benefit of the medical insurance that maybe some Georgians purchase. But I'll tell you, this is coming into play even when there is no insurance purchased. We're still being put on the hook for our own bill, which we weren't reimbursed for at all, but it will be put in front of a jury as though 100% was paid. It's a very unlevel playing field. And we've heard a lot today about how smart jurors are, and I certainly agree with that. I also think they're trying really hard to do a good job.

but they need the accurate information to do that with. I think is ironic that every single witness that takes the stand in a trial has to swear to tell the truth. And the trials are very fact driven, but this is one area where a medical bill is submitted into evidence and it goes back into the jury room and everyone in that courtroom except the jurors know that that bill is not accurate. But yet we can don that and we base damages on that. If I could have just a couple more minutes please. You know what impact does this have on on Georgians? It is driving up insurance premiums. I can tell you that while Piedmont has a great experience from a claims perspective, our insurance, our professional liability commercial purchase insurance has increased by 270% since 2018. And how does that impact Georgians? Well you know we do serve 80% of the state and as a not-for-profit we are investing back into those communities and Georgians are much better off with us rather than increasing spending those that money on increased insurance premiums and insurance claim costs. They are much better off with us putting in MRIs, expanding emergency room access, buying state of the art, the ventry robots, recruiting and employing more physicians and nurses to provide that health care. So I think it is a fallacy to suggest that Georgians aren't experiencing this and that this is a bill that is really focused on insurance alone. What we want is a fair playing field and the first way to get that is to eliminate fandom damages. Thank you. You have a question from look park. Thank you Mr. Chairman. I know you are here to talk about fandom damages. I have read some studies saying that at least for analysis of Texas adoption of caps on non-inconomic damages does not reduce but may actually increase health care costs. I would love to see if you have any studies or analysis that would otherwise rebut that claim. I am concerned especially as we are focusing on section 7 today of some of the claims as well as some of the information I have received that patients especially those who are uninsured, those who are on Medicare or Medicaid would only be able to receive catastrophic care under this legislation. Can you better help me understand section 7 and the impact that this legislation would have especially on our under insured and uninsured population? Well the first thing I would say is we employ thousands of providers who are providing that uninsured care, who are providing care for Medicare and Medicaid patients and it is not going to impact the care that they receive. I don't understand that argument. I may not be the best person to address that but I see no evidence that that would be the case. In regards to your question about Texas, I don't have studies, what I have is real life experience. We live this every day and we are trying to resolve cases for a fair amount every day. We did hear some comments that the reason they should be able to put the full bill in is because they have to hire a lawyer to get a recovery. That is also a fallacy. I can speak for Piedmont health care and say if we owe you, we are going to pay you whether you have a lawyer or not and we are going to pay you a fair amount. We have a long experience with doing that and we have patients that leave happy because we have treated them fairly. So I don't have studies. I know we heard from the law professor from New York and that this has no impact on the court reform. The only thing I can tell you is severity and professional liability claims. I think we have heard some testimony today that there is no increase in severity or Georgia is no worse than any other state. There is independent actuarial analysis showing that in professional liability claims Georgia outpaces the rest of the nation two to one in the severity of claims in the last decade in the professional liability space. And it would be naive I think for any of us to believe that that is not driving up insurance premiums. If you could share that study with us I think that would be greatly appreciated. Now, again, especially for those who support this bill, I am very concerned in terms of the potential impact this may have. Again, on Medicare, Medicaid and otherwise uninsured patients. And so certainly appreciate your testimony and not the good work that Piedmont Health Care does. So I'll leave it there. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You have no further questions. Thank you. Oh, wait, I'm sorry. My fellow Dr. Prakash. Thank you. And thank you to all your team and the 40,000 who are doing great work across the large part of Georgia. I just kind of quick at points. You mentioned insured and uninsured. Do you know if you'll have a discount program for people who are uninsured and if so do you know a ballpark about how much that would be? Across the top, uninsured get 30% discount and then they are often it's written off more. And the same goes for self pay. Well, let me say it's the same thing. But for us, it's two different. There's self pay who have the ability to pay and they're they are uninsured that don't. So self pay immediately get 30% written off and then they're maybe further negotiation. Uninsured more times than not. That's going to be right off. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. Zach Matthews and then Charles Tarbotton your own day. Good afternoon. My name is Zach Matthews. I'm Michael Curry and Branch. I have a little presentation here. I'll just bring this up. We primarily defend truck-rect cases with the occasional catastrophic injury case in the negligent security space. Yes sir. What I did was yesterday I reached out to one of our clients to get a quote on the commercial auto rates for one truck or commercial auto in Alabama versus Georgia. As of yesterday insurance in Georgia is 32 to 40% more expensive than in Alabama. I actually had a conversation with my eye doctor on the way here. I had to go by the eye doctor and asked her do you have a commercial auto for this eye clinic? She said yes for our employees to drive. It's not just big trucks. Why are insurance bills higher in Georgia? Where is my insurance money going? One of the things we do is litigate a lot with litigation-based medical clinics. There are specialty clinics we call lean clinics that basically just do lawsuits. In discovery we have been able to get information from them about how many of those cases they are doing. This is one example from a North Georgia lean clinic that in three years took in 29,340 patients from lawyers. The lawyers are on this list. They're redacted right there for their courtesy. But practically every law firm that does personal injury work in Georgia participates in this space. That clinic billed those 29,231 million dollars in three years. They collected 51 million dollars. Ewers and 0.001% of those charges were routed through health insurance for those plaintiffs. This is real data. This is not hypothetical. It's right there that's from inside the house. This is data on how many Georgians have insurance by category. 11.4% of Georgians are uninsured. I would challenge you to walk around and find 29,340 people who don't have insurance out of the 11% of this population walking around these streets. It's impossible. They are convincing people not to use their insurance. That's driving them out of the healthcare system and out of the structures the healthcare system has to govern these procedures. One of the things that one of the doctors testified to earlier was that Medicare Medicaid doesn't pay reimbursement for certain procedures. So there's nothing to compare to it. That is true. Medicare Medicaid doesn't reimburse for snake oil either. They don't reimburse for procedures. They don't believe they're medically necessary. So part of the problem is when you take people out of health insurance, you take the referees out of the game. No one is checking to see if these procedures are necessary or medically indicated. The same liability insurer that gave me that rate quote is currently losing 28.9% per year in Georgia and out of those of you that run businesses know if you lose almost the third of your money a year, you're not going to stay in business for a long. They do make money in other spaces, but this is a space that they're not going to be able to turn a profit in in this state. These are real pictures of real injuries that we've seen almost done. Million dollar demands, no damage, million dollar demand, bumper tap, million dollar demand, no damage, million dollar demand, $800,000 in medical expenses with no damage. We have testimony from citizens of Georgia saying that they have been convinced to go off of their insurance and accept injections to drive up the value of their lawsuit. And we have emails from inside the house between members of the Georgia Trailers Association and Lincoln saying quote, there is a $1 million policy on the other side and all caps. I gave this info earlier. She wants to end treatment and I want her to continue. The end of the day, this is about money. The policy premiums that people are paying in Georgia are going to line the pockets of people that are specializing in this space and it's an easily correctable problem. This bill will correct that problem and it should be passed. Thank you. Rose, I have evidence. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, could we have these slides and any of the background information? You kind of flip through that really quick and said there's all these medical damages, but we don't have any. Show me which slide you like. It's anecdotal, so we don't have any. We don't know, right? We don't know any details about what actually happened in these cases. You want us to hear me in? Well, I wish I could, but do you have some actual data that you can share with us other than this summary PowerPoint? This data was produced to us in discovering an actual case. Can you give us the production? I certainly can. I don't know that I want to do that. I don't think it would be very, very good. But you gave us the summary, so we can't have the background facts. If you want to send an email to my office, I'll see if that can be arranged. I will. And you can leave it to me before you leave. I want to go back to where we started though. You showed this quote from a Georgia carrier and an Alabama carrier. Were you aware that drivers on the street in Georgia are, were the twice as likely to be an accident than they are in Alabama? Did you think that might have something to do with the rate? Yes, man, that's a fair point. You're pointing out that Georgia's got a lot of people. Just got a lot of traffic. We've just got a lot of rats. And that's true. A lot of highways. That's true. But this is by percentage. This is by percentage. No, but it's a big dollar. So why should it be a big difference? It's been Georgia by percentage than it is in Alabama. It doesn't make any sense. Because your choice is likely to get into an accident here. And the rate, the difference of what Georgians pay is not that much more than they pay in Alabama considering their twice as likely. That should probably be double. If we were going on percentages, right? I don't know that I follow that math, but even if that were true, it still doesn't make sense that an insurance company would be losing this amount of money in a year. Well, and that was my next question. Where's that information? Who is this liability insurer? And where is the data that we can look at to say that they're losing 28.9% a year? They were generous enough to share this with me, but they asked me not to use their name. I'm going to respect that. So there's no way we can fact check anything you just told us. We don't know who it is. We don't know what 28.9% where that comes from. We have no idea, right? That's true. You can accuse me of lying. You don't know what they told you. They didn't want to give you their name. They don't want to give any background. No, they showed me the background. I put them out together for you. Can you share it with us? No, ma'am. Thank you. I'm sorry. I just had a thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just had a question about your 11% that can you go back there? Okay. So you're saying that 11% of Georgians are uninsured? This is not me saying this. This is probably the available data, but that's my understanding, yes, ma'am. Okay. And so I guess my question is, what is that number and who composes that number? Like, what is the actual number of it? And then who's in that number? Those would be people who are not being provided with insurance by an employer? By a federal government program like Medicaid or Medicare, which is split out in the charge, like military, there's a small percentage of military insurance and the non-group insurance, which is kind of a catch-all category. Those would be people who don't have health insurance. Yeah, but I mean, I guess my question is, the percentage is smaller than, I guess, other folks, but like, what is the number and then what is the correlation of that to the folks who saw this, who went to this clinic? I mean, it's not the number of it. I guess, who went to this clinic? I mean, it seems like you're trying to make a point with that and I didn't get it. Yeah, okay, I'm sorry. There are 11% of people walking around who don't have health insurance. So if you go out in the room and you count 100 people, you should find 11 of them who are uninsured from the population of Georgia. This clinic managed to gather up 29,340 people for a three-year period to treat, and none of them had health insurance. I don't buy that. That's not possible. Is it that they don't have health insurance or they elect not to use their health insurance? It's the last one. Or is it that? So that's what you're saying? Yes, they are electing not to use their health insurance. And you know that for 29,000 people, that's what you're representing? That's not what I'm representing. That's what the data shows I could show it to you. And out of $230 million charge, the insurance receipts total was $27,000. That is 0.01%. Okay. And so I guess my question, I'll say this. There are some people who have car accidents who are not at fault, who don't want to make a claim on their own insurance. If a person pays for insurance, isn't there right to use it or not use like what? I'm just trying to follow your point on this. No, I think you make a very good point. I think if that same person was willing to come into a jury and tell them the truth about what their damages are really worth, on the open market, then it would be okay for them to say, I don't want my insurance to have to pay that. And they elect not to use their insurance, and then they try to use that as a lever to get the full 100% charge master in trial, in order to inflate their own damages, and to inflate the damages of the people that have treated them on a lean. I do have a problem with that. I don't think that's right. All right. Thank you, you have no further questions. All right. It's a tar button. And Vicky Lewis, your own deck, man. Turn this off for yourself. I think that's all right. All right. Hold on, Mr. Matthews, can you give me like one second? I was just going to find your email on the bar website, but I typed, Zach Matthews, and I didn't see you. Could you just tell me your email address? Cmcmcblawfirm.com. Two H's, I mean, two T's. Cmcblawfirm.com. Cmcblawfirm.com. Cmcblawfirm.com. Thank you. All right, Mr. Charvon. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee. And thank you for the opportunity to come here today. And thank you for your service. My name is Charles Tarbotton. I am the president of BH Transfer Company based in Sandersville, Georgia. BH is a 54-year-old family-owned trucking company that primarily serves customers in the Southeast United States and internationally through the ports of Savannah and Charleston. We provide good jobs and financial security to 325 families across about two dozen counties in middle in Southeast Georgia. In addition, I currently serve as the chair of the Georgia Motor Trucking Association. There are over 335 Georgians employed in trucking 1 in 12 jobs statewide. We are as diverse as any industry in America. We live in every in every house district and we both. Let me be clear. Our industry's top priority is safety and compliance. There are bad actors in every industry. That is why regulatory oversight exists. There are injured parties connected with every industry. They deserve to be made whole. Our industry is committed to do the right thing by those injured by a commercial vehicle. But our industry is overwhelmed by frivolous lawsuits with claimants that have no demonstrable or verifiable injury with collisions from collisions in which physical damage to vehicles is minor if it exists at all. I am here today in support of SB 68 and specifically in favor of changes to the so-called phantom damages. Phantom damages are inflated economic damages calculated using the dollar of amount of patient is billed for medical services instead of the amount actually paid. In fact, very few patients actually pay the full bill to mount as you have heard from others this afternoon. And actual payments to providers generally range from one quarter to one third of the full bill to mount. Claimants should be made whole and recover economic damages equal to their actual cost but not an inflated artificial amount that they have not actually paid. General or non-economic damages are typically a multiple of special or economic damages. We have a current case where claimant alleges $50,000 in medical cost and has demanded $400,000 to settle the claim. The total demand is eight times the asserted economic damages. Let's assume for a moment the plaintiff actually paid 50% or 25% of the full bill to mount instead of the significantly lower range that I referred to earlier. Still, the eight times actual economic damages would yield a demand of $200,000 versus the full hundred, this difference, excuse me, having computer problems at the same time. The total demand is eight times the asserted economic, excuse me, the difference between the billed amounts drives up the cost of the non-economic damages. Yes, sir. I would just say that phantom damages are an artifice and all we are asking for in this, in what we support in Senate Bill 68 and the phantom damages section is the admissibility of the actual paid damage that sets a floor and the full billed amounts that's a ceiling for the jury. But the jury to consider is laid at term and damages. Thank you very much. Thank you. I don't see you having any questions. Ms. Lewis, and Dr. Patrice Walker is on deck. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. I'm Vicki Lewis. I'm the president and CEO of Coffee Regional Medical Center in Douglas, Georgia. I'm here today to encourage your support for healthcare liability reform. This reform is essential to our hospital. We are a 98-bed acute care hospital in South Georgia. In addition to serving our county of 44,000, we serve six nearby counties, some of which have critical access hospitals and some of which have no inpatient services. We provide obstetrics, cardiology, oncology, and general surgery. We have a very, very busy emergency department and bring patients again from a pretty wide geographical area. We're about the polar opposite of Piedmont. But we care for all patients regardless of their insurance status or their ability to pay. In 2024, we delivered 1,000 babies. We saw 52,000 people in our emergency department and our walk-in. We cared for over 8,500 oncology patients and we performed 4,000 surgical procedures. Again, pretty remarkable for accounting of 44,000 residents. Our services are essential and foundational to our county and our surrounding communities. We know that a strong hospital is part of the economy and we take that responsibility very seriously. There are two primary challenges coffee regional faces every day. The recruitment and retention of talented physicians and staff and operating with a positive bottom line. The toward environment in Georgia is a challenge to both of those. Certainly our payermix and our rural location bear on these challenges but the continuing increase in costs for medical malpractice, including defense and insurance and premiums, bring a significant challenge. We believe like other hospitals it's our responsibility to have appropriate insurance and we have a deep understanding of patient care. None of our caregivers or physicians come to work every day to harm anybody. Our care is to we want to do what's expected and we believe in a patient's right to file a lawsuit if something unexpected happens. But we also support hospitals and physicians ability to care for their patients in a safe and calm way and we do everything we can to support our physicians. Several years ago we pivoted to self insurance because we couldn't afford our premiums and we also established a self insurance pool. Despite our efforts to control our costs by doing this, we have experienced dramatically increasing costs of defending the hospital in our physicians. Since 2024 coffee regionals excess coverage costs has increased by $3.5 million and just have a couple of more things if that's okay. So this is not our insurance premium. This is the excess coverage that we have to buy that sits on top of our self insurance fund. This is multiples of the bottom line that coffee regional medical center is able to earn each year and experience. Our excess coverage carriers tell us the reason for the increase is as you've heard before not related to the experience in coffee county but rather the verdicts and settlements throughout Georgia including the number of cases exceeding $10 million. It's challenging to avoid passing these costs on to our patients. Last year we had a physician who after a long career in a high risk specialty decided along with his lawyers to take a case to trial. They had tried very very hard to settle the case for a fair and reasonable amount. They were not able to do that. They decided to take the case to trial and unfortunately several things happened in that trial that have been described today as well. The jury was prevented from knowing how much plaintiff and plaintiff's insurer actually paid for medical costs and what the balance to the patient was. Leaving the jury with a very inflated impression of the cost and the jury was also presented with an artificial dollar amount for pain and suffering completely unrelated to the patient's care. The jury awarded a very inflated amount to plaintiff and unfortunately after that our physician made a difficult decision to step away from medicine. It was very deflating for him and discouraging. That jury decision also impacted other physicians on our staff and their decisions about whether to settle a case or to go to trial. I think that their confidence too in their own medical care was impacted. We have attempted to recruit and replace this physician for 18 months and not be able to do that. Our mission at Coffee Regional is to provide exceptional care and wellness close to home. It is a challenge for many South Georgia residents to travel outside South Georgia to receive care. We don't want to stop providing specialized services, especially when significant numbers of our community need it. But we certainly contemplate that every day. I believe with the legislative support of Governor Kim's reform package and Senator Kennedy's Senate Bill 68, healthcare liability costs will indeed be reduced. I am confident that Coffee Regional Medical Center and our colleagues at other hospitals will be provided with the opportunity to continue to operate as full service hospitals serving our patients and communities. I urge your support of this important legislation. Thank you. You have a few questions. What part? Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mrs. Lewis, first and foremost, thank you so much for all of your incredibly important work, especially in serving the patients of South Georgia. Again, with respect to Section 7, I am trying to get a better understanding. If Section 7 resulted in Medicare, Medicaid and uninsured patients receiving only catastrophic care and being forced to only go to emergency rooms, would you want to see amendments to Section 7 of this legislation? I can't speak specifically to Section 7. Again, our mission is to care for all patients regardless of their ability of pay, regardless of how they enter our system. So we provide care on an ambulatory basis and obviously an emergency department. We also staff and underinsured and uninsured clinic in our community. Our patients can come for care. Thank you. I would greatly appreciate that as a one-dimensional question. Would you be able to share how much an uncompensated healthcare costs you currently have and how that can trust to your insurance costs? Can you ask the question a different way? So we have uncompensated healthcare costs, right? And certainly, you know, it sounds like you all are serving a lot of those patients who have no health insurance whatsoever. At least with respect to paid monthly, simply write them off. I'm trying to get a better understanding of how much for the hospital associations but for y'all is, well, how much are your uncompensated healthcare costs? For every dollar we bill, we collect 22.5 cents. Okay. So we have a significant amount of uncompensated care. Again, that's directly related to the number of patients we care for that are uninsured and those that are underinsured. So it is a significant amount of money. We are about a $600 million operation from a gross standpoint and a $170 million operation from a net standpoint. So we can see the impact of what we're doing is very difficult. So our uncompensated care is significant. Absolutely. And I've certainly worked on various proposals to cover our uninsured population to help address this uncompensated healthcare cost. How does that then come?

to the right y'all's rising insurance costs. I think there's a direct correlation. You know, I think that the rising insurance costs are a function of, unfortunately, the cost that we have to pass on to our patients. We allow for that because we care for patients no matter their ability to pay. You know, so it's every commercial contract we have as a discount off-build charges or we have a contractual rate that is a small percentage of our charges. We work very hard not to inflate our charges because we know that our community cannot pay those. But I think the 22 and a half cents speaks for itself. Thank you. Good luck. Thank you, report. Chair Lady Miller. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm just, I want to ask a question because I'm still struggling to understand some of this billing stuff. I'm not an expert in it at all. But if a patient has a procedure in the hospital, it's $100,000. In the facility, it's $100,000. But they don't use their insurance. Do they owe $100,000 or do they owe only what their insurance would have paid? So, let's say for example, $25,000. Any other questions confusing? Does the patient have insurance or not? The patient has it, but let's say they don't use it in my hypothetical. So the insurance is not billed. Patient has a procedure. The procedure costs $100,000. But if the patient had used their Blue Cross Blue Shield or whatever, it would have been essentially a $25,000 bill. What number of that would the patient owe? Would they owe you what they, the actual $100,000 or would they owe you the $25,000 that you would have gotten if the, if the patient had used his insurance? Does that make sense? Not exactly, but I'll try to address the question. Okay. First of all, if a patient has paid for insurance and has insurance, what our financial counselors would do is to encourage that patient to use their insurance. It's a premium they paid. They have a, they qualify for it. So we would encourage them to do that. If a patient doesn't have insurance, they do receive a discount as a cash. If they pay cash over time or an alum's sum. But again, we write off a significant amount of our care because of patients who don't have insurance. I'm, I'm really struggled sometimes and I know there have been some examples here with patients not using coverage that they have. If the premiums have been paid, impart by them and impart by an employer. Obviously it's coverage they have and so they typically use it. Balance bills are often also written off. So again, if a patient's insurance company has a discounted off-build charges kind of summary and the insurance pays a portion of that. We try to work out, you know, payment plans with patients and oftentimes those are written off. Is there ever a situation in this may, this may not happen, but I just want to understand. Is there ever a situation where a patient shows up, patient goes to ER for example or is admitted. Patients insurance is not built. Patient then is involved in litigation over their injury and it's a $100,000 bill. Does a hospital benefit more, guess what I'm trying to ask, are there situations or you're aware of situations where hospitals do not build the insurance because getting a settlement from the lawsuit will actually be more money than building the insurance? Never. Okay. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, thank you. Ms. Lewis for being here. A couple of questions. One, you were telling us that the excess coverage costs went up by 3.5 million since 2024. What's the total that you all paid for excess coverage since 2024? Oh, gee. I don't know if I can add that up. I can't give you that number. I can get it for you. Again, it's gone up from $550,000 in 2014 to $4 million in 2025. But I can give you the total cost there. So this is over a, okay, I wrote down since 2024. So we're talking about a 10-year... 2014, 2014. It's a 10-year period. That's the increase. Okay. So $550,000 in the forecast. And again, that is excess coverage. Sure. That's over and above premiums we pay or money that we set aside in our self insurance fund. Right. And you mentioned that one of the reasons... I can't remember if you said the carrier told you or you assumed that one of the reasons for the increased increases has been litigation costs. Was that something you assumed or was that something the carrier told you? That's what the carrier told you. And the carrier told you any other reasons why insurance rates were going up. I think that Georgia environment, the total number of lawsuits that have been filed. I mean, our own experiences that over the past 10 years... And I'm using a 10-year time print because that's the length of time I've been at Coffee Regional. Over the past 10 years, the number of increases... Lawsuits filed annually has increased steadily. And do you have those numbers for us that increase number of filing? I think the carrier provided to you. So then, lawsuits filed? Yes. I can get those. Okay. That would be great. And then... But my question, I want to go back to it, was did the carrier give you any other reasons for the increase? Are you saying that the carrier said the increased costs were just because the number of lawsuits filed were going up? Or was there any other reasons that they gave? Yes, there were other reasons that were given. What was it? You know, I mean, I think they're varied a little bit. One of the reasons is the attachment points in the policy because of our exposure and the number of lawsuits filed. We paid an extra premium to bring those attachment points down. Anything not related to lawsuit? Lawsuits that the carrier said was part of the reason for the insurance increase. No. That just lawsuits. Not given to us again. I'm not saying that there might not be other reasons, but those were not shared with us at the time that we were renewing our policy. And who is the carrier? Meg. And you also... I think you were saying, I want to make sure I heard this right. You believe uncompensated care is probably part of the increase as well. Did I hear that right? Maybe I didn't. No, I don't think you heard that correctly. I don't think uncompensated care is related to it. Again, I think the number of lawsuits, the amount of the settlements, the risk. I mean, the actuaries are obviously the ones that run the math on what the premiums are going to be for us. But it's not just our experience that drives those premiums. And we've been given pretty clear information about that. That is a Georgia-related. And we can get that data that you have that's pretty clear. You could share that with us. Again, I only have that for our premiums. Right, but that's fine. You also said that someone had told you the number of cases exceeding $10 million with part of this reason. Do you have that data that you can share with us as well? We do. Okay. Do you believe that... Well, I know recently you all have done a great job having to deal with the aftermath of Haleen. And the extra care I'm sure that was required for that. I know you all had problems with power and water and other things. We did. And that was not the first storm that you all had to deal with. It was done. How many would you say over the last ten years, major storms where you've had similar sort of... I mean, this one was a pretty bad one. But how many do you think? I mean, three. I mean, it's not every year by any stretch. Three. I think that any of those storms had anything to do with the increase in coverage. In medical malpractice? The excess coverage, anything. Any of your insurance costs? You know, I'm not sure that I can really comment on that. I don't think I have the information to comment on that. I'm not sure that's a line I could connect. Okay. Let me just make sure I've written some notes and I can't read mine on handwriting. Well, I think if you could just follow up with us and let us have the same data that you have, that would be appreciated if we need to get it from Mag. We can do that too because I'm assuming that they provided it to you. Maybe they provided it to others. Again, they provided to our hospital like they do others, particularly to our experience. The number of cases over ten million is available to us through our self-insured captive. Okay. I'm sure wherever it comes from, if you could get that to us, maybe this week, that would be really appreciated. I'm happy to share that. I'm assuming that the GHA has your contact information. Yes. Oh, yeah. Thank you. You're welcome. The term new. Thank you. And just one more thank you for coming up here all that way from Coffee County and Coffee Regional. Thank you for doing that. Do you think that this bill, you know, mind you, if this bill does succeed in slowing the increase in that excess coverage and premiums and everything else? Do you think that will help you care for patients better in South Georgia? Absolutely. Well, thank you for being here and thank you to your team. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for testing, Bonnie. Dr. Walker and Dr. Cannon is next. Good evening. Good evening. I am Patrice Walker. I am the Chief Medical Officer for Atrium Health Navisant, where we have our flagship hospital located in Macon, Georgia, but we also have a critical access hospital and a small acute care rural hospital. Not only am I chief medical officer, but I'm also an OBGYN. And certainly in that specialty, we have been getting sued long before. It was the sexy thing for everyone else. So my perspective comes from both hats. At the end of the day, the current medical legal climate in Georgia is causing physicians to change their practice patterns. And I see that every single day in my facility. And what I mean by that is there are some things that are more subtle than others. For example, I may have a physician who orders low-value testing. Just to be on the safe side, I may have a physician who keeps a patient for an additional day, just to be on the safe side, when all other evidence-based practices say the test is not necessary or the patient can go home. Yet we have physicians who feel the pressure of needing to do these additional things based off of their risk-versiveness. And those are just a couple of examples of what we see every day. And ultimately, these things are affecting access to care for patients. Because if we're keeping patients longer for a test or a study, then that means right now, one of the patients in our emergency room is waiting for a bed that I don't have to give them because there's a patient already in that bed. And so, in essence, when there is a decrease in access, people present with advanced disease or advanced disease states for things that really are preventable and could be treated earlier, that means for OB patients, they may show up with limited or no prenatal care, so that fetal anomalies or complications of pregnancy are missed. And we cannot expect to improve our maternal morbidity or mortality numbers without solving access to care in rural or underserved areas. In addition, our flagship hospital is a teaching hospital. And so, my lived experience, as opposed to some of the opposition testimony that you heard today, is certainly that our medical students and our residents are including the malpractice climate in Georgia as part of their rationale for whether they will or will not practice here in the state of Georgia. Is it the only reason? No, it's certainly not. But I think it's on the list and we really cannot ignore it. And as far as the people in this room, that's one thing that you have control over. You may not have control over the fact that they're also looking for competitive pay because they have a lot of debt. They're looking for lifestyle flexibility. They're looking for the ability to practice the full scope of medicine. But you can and do have the ability to impact their risk as far as the possible. The out of pocket costs to them and their employers like our health system. And so, I really want us to make sure we don't get distracted and focus on what you do have the ability to control here. And that is, I fully support this bill and I think that this bill will help retain positions to practice here in the state of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Dr. Walker, for being here. I think you said, and if you didn't say this, just let me know if you agree, that people sometimes present late for, like if they delay care, they're going to be more sick. That's a word, sicker. And do you agree that sometimes people delay care because they don't have insurance? That is one reason, but really my point here is that their, so access is already an issue. And yes, it may be because they don't have insurance. But also, I think it has to do with whether they have insurance or not. Are there physicians in their community that can provide them care? So it's one thing to have insurance. That's something. But if you have to travel a long distance, if you have to miss work, you know, if transportation is a barrier, that insurance is just one piece of what you need. So my point here is that it's more than just having insurance that affects someone's access to care. They need to have access to a physician and a clinic to get that care at. Sure, but that's a big part of it, and we've got a lot of uninsured people in Georgia. Have you been down here advocating for increased coverage, expansion of Medicaid, things like that? Yes, you know, expansion of Medicaid is certainly controversial. I would like for there to be access to, you know, coverage in whatever form. I think that can look a lot of different ways. But again, you know, I would reflect back on having that coverage is one piece. There have to be physicians and providers to utilize that insurance. I'm just trying to think of some of the things that are within our control and helping people get coverage is one of those. My last question is, right there in my brain, let me see if I can get it back in my brain. Oh, yes. So let's go to an example where someone has health insurance. They come for treatment. You've been a doctor. It sounds like for a long time. Insurance doesn't always approve what the doctor and the patient decide is the right care. Is that accurate? That is accurate. And sometimes that's not super predictable, is it? Sometimes. And so under this bill, we're setting up the scenario where a patient is, when they're, we're predicting future care, there, if they, if they have insurance and it's possible that they use in the future, that's going to be used to sort of calculate the damage for that future coverage. And that's not really predictable, is it? Whether it's going to be covered in the future, and if it is at what rate it's going to be covered, and whether that patient would even have the same insurance, would you agree that that's a, that's a lot of hypotheticals. If I follow you, that is, that is a lot of hypotheticals. I don't, I want to make sure I understand what, what you're asking, I've got one more time. I'm sorry. Sure, yeah, and it's confusing. Under this framework that we've set up here in this proposed in a bill 68, not only is a plaintiff, these alleged fan of damages, you and other proponents of the bill are asking that, the amount that gets claimed for past medical damages, is the amount actually paid, not the amount bill. That also is under the framework of Senate Bill 68, supposed to apply to future medical expenses. And so they're asked, this bill would require a plaintiff and their lawyer to talk about, okay, this is what we think the care should be, and this is what the cost will be if the person has insurance. And we can't really know that, can we? We can't know if it's going to be covered, we can't know at what rate it's going to be covered in the future, or even if that person's going to have the same health insurance in the future, right? Those are all hypotheticals. Yes. Correct. Okay, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Dr. For coming. I just wanted to clarify, I think, I thought I heard you say that it's the legal environment or lawsuit that is creating a shortage of doctors, is that, is that what you said, or did I get that wrong? So I think there is a link there. No, it is not the sole reason, but particularly I can speak to OBGYN as a specialty. And our specialty, you can actually divide your practice into obstetric care and gynecologic care. And so you can choose to do both. One, either or. So what generally happens is most people start off practicing both. You're trying to build your practice. You need to get patients in, so you're seeing OB and GYN patients. Over the course of the career, as particularly as you get towards the end of your career and their lifestyle, you know, is challenging. A lot of physicians choose to stop doing obstetrics. And so they are able to continue just doing GYN. I think the current climate is allowing people to make those decisions or forcing, I would say. Some people to make those decisions sooner rather than later, if they can financially, you know, afford that. And your malpractice insurance goes down once you stop obstetrics because the bulk of the risk, not all, but the bulk of the risk comes from obstetric practice. So if you can decrease your obstetric practice or stop your obstetric practice and still practice your GYN side, you can still, you know, make a profit. In most cases and have decreased, you know, malpractice risk. So those are the types of things that influence access to care because if you have less OB providers, then those same OB patients have to go further out to get that OB care. Okay. I think you and I think that's what you're saying is that based on your experience because my understanding of studies and if you're familiar with them, you can tell me you're familiar or not. Is that the rationale or the reason why these shortages are occurring is it's based on a very complex number of factors. One to include an aging population and increased demand for healthcare, increasing older adults require more healthcare, greater demand for physicians, baby boomer retirement, increased lifespan, position burnout, health care workforce issues, limited training capacity, residency caps as it relates to Medicare and Medicaid, specialization, many medical doctors choose to specialize, which can exacerbate shortages in other essential areas, rural areas, many positions prefer to work in urban areas leading to shortages and rural areas. Cost of medical education student loan debt. Would you agree that those are the things that the studies have found, which are the rationale or the basis why we are across the nation experiencing doctor shortages? So I'm not familiar with that exact study that you're talking about nor do I disagree that it is a multifactorial issue. I don't think anyone's claiming this is the sole reason. I think it is a contributing factor and depending on the perspective or the specialty, it may be a larger contributing factor for some than others. So those things on your list are real things but also this and again this is my lived experience and in terms of my lived experience and the size, we're bigger than coffee, smaller than peedmont, but we're there and so we train over 120 residents and fellows every year. So I don't have that study but I have what I do every single day that proves those numbers out. Thank you, thank you and I appreciate your experience and value it very much. My second question, which is my last question that's specific to OBGYNs, we have heard and seen reporting and actually heard from doctors who have come down here and testified OBGYNs who have testified that Georgia, one of the reasons, another reason in the complex factor for OBGYNs is that the six-week abortion ban, which criminalizes doctors for providing abortion care and health care has influenced the number of OBGYNs who want to come down here and practice, residents who want to do their residency here. Would you agree that with some OBGYNs and in that profession places that are hostile to or who have these sort of criminalization of practicing medicine, statutes also contribute to a shortage of doctors? Yes, I do, in fact, and I think I mentioned most physicians are going to want to practice at the top of their license and that means that everything that we get trained for, we want the ability to try and incorporate that in our practice as we see fit. So when there are practice environments that limitations or external limitations on that, that can certainly influence someone's decision about whether or not they want to practice there. In addition to that, though, I would also add that if you do choose to practice in an environment like we have currently here in Georgia that doesn't stop the patients from coming in. So having the additional risk of a patient who has maybe attempted an illegal abortion or who falls into that gray area, I'll say it, where the rules are very not clear, places the burden on the position to, I want to take care of the patient that's in front of me, I want to do the right thing for the patient. And yet I'm at risk if I intervene because of some of these laws that I have to practice under. So that too also affects their decisions about where to practice and what environment they feel that risk is worth taking. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Especially as a hospital kind of between the size of Piedmont and Cochlear Regional. Could you speak to again the impact of uncompensated healthcare costs versus your insurance costs, which places a greater strain on your hospital? I don't know that I can say which places a greater strain on the hospital. In terms of our uncompensated care, I can tell you that for our system, we have about $248.3 million per year in uncompensated care and other community benefits. There's an other bucket, but that breaks down to about $680,000 per day. And so what I don't have on hand is that number compared to our, you know, the other insurance costs. The insurance costs. So I can't tell you the balance of that between the two, but certainly it is impacted. And again, thank you for your testimony. Again, I've also been trying to get a better understanding of Section 7. I know there's a lot of legal ease in here, but you know, if Section 7 said that Medicare and Medicaid patients could only get catastrophic care or healthcare in emergency rooms, would you still support this bill? Would you want to see an amendment? I mean, like others, I don't know that I can speak specifically to Section 7. I feel like we all need to go home and study Section 7 a little bit more. Again, like my colleague has said, we want to provide care to everyone and we will. We're not going to turn patients away. I would go back to the statement that I have already made in terms of someone simply having insurance coverage is not the end all. What we see is that that is, you know, having some is better, something is better than nothing, but ultimately there is a, what is the quality of that, you know, of that insurance coverage? So to say, if all they have is catastrophic insurance, is that good enough? I mean, I think that really undervalues or it really minimizes the totality of, it's part of a bigger conversation. I guess it's what I'm trying to say. Without a doubt, I think any access to healthcare is better than including with respect to emergency room services, but of course, you know, it's also a matter of preventative care and the health outcomes of patients, in which unfortunately given having one of the highest insurance rates in the country, based on decisions that this body has made that we otherwise had control over. I'm again, you know, something to certainly address more and again, hopefully we'll have some more information about that section. Thank you. Thank you. Dr. Thank you so much for your testimony. Appreciate your time. Thank you very much. Dr. Brett Cannon, and then Brett Johnson is next. So we're finishing up with the two breads. All right. Absolutely appreciated. Mr. Chairman and committee members, let me thank you for the time to address. Senate Bill 68 on behalf of medical association of Georgia and Brett Cannon, I'm a physician, I'm a Georgia in 1997, the complete residency and emergency medicine. I've been on medical stats and treated patients across the state and currently residing practice in the metro area. I also have a law degree in admitted to the state bar, I'm a current president of Georgia College of Emergency Physicians and also the chair of mags, lawsuit report task force. That a bit better. Thank you. More than a decade, we've been experiencing widespread and fundamental disparity in the civil justice system that has a significant role in creating a crisis and delivery of healthcare, but related to access. This is substantially increased costs of care. The cost has been related, at least in part to hire a malpractice premiums than found in neighboring states and recently hire recruitment and retention cost of physicians related to the reputation Georgia has in the medical community, regarding medical malpractice environment. The reforms proposed in Senate Bill 68 would have a very real impact in addressing this crisis not only in healthcare, but for businesses and industries across the state. Over the past few months, Mag is studied what neighboring states have done, talked with physicians, hospitals, insurers and legislators with the law finding common sense and balanced solutions. We feel that Senate Bill 68 achieves those goals and moves this closure of the parity with nearby states on the issues of civil justice and still protects patients' access to the courts and to be clear patients and plaintiffs should have that access. There's a necessary balance though between adequately compensating patients in a system that is so punitive and unfair that it destroys its physicians from practicing or seeing complex patients or going into high risk specialties or moving to rural areas with scarce backup or even moving into the field of medicine and making it less attractive for our best and brightest students to pursue. I believe these bills will improve access and quality by making Georgia a more attractive place to practice medicine than it is currently. Regarding the health of the insurance market, I can only tell you my group's experience and that is we have a captive with a large established respected national insurer based on the review of the claims history was determined this past December that the captive was underfunded by millions, 13 million for 2023 and 28 million for 2024. This is an accessible was collected from policy and truly effects and threatens my practices ability to remain viable. This is not ensure doing well and it's not due to investment cycles. Regarding the sections being focused.

On the day I would note that medical malpractice trials are increasingly complex, often in employing battle of experts and complicated medical issues. Our experience in North Carolina based on feedback from attorneys and jurors is that there's a significant benefit to such complex cases and separating issues of negligence and damages. And truth and damages is particularly relevant for any trials dealing with medical bills. We all know that build amounts and paid amounts will oddly differ and there are discounts applied for insured and uninsured light. There's no logic to using the amount that everyone knows is artificially inflated and rarely if ever collected is being the true measure of damages. I'd also like to touch briefly on anchoring, having witnessed it in trials and seeing its effectiveness. It's a powerful, manipulative tool and easy, very difficult for a defense system to rebut, is there's a risk in confusing your fending the jury when suggesting low values to counter the high. I'd like to, if I can, 30 seconds, just to touch on two antidotes. And that is, as the previous speaker noted, that for years we've had physicians that I'd interview and they would ask about MRIs and CTXS and cardiac caths and nursing staffing. But several years ago that switched. And the questions are not only about, do we just not practice environment in general, but specific cases. The SSRI case that was worth 20 million, the tooth that was worth 50, the cast case that was worth 9. And just yesterday when the appellate court confirmed a $75 million verdict against the radiologist and emergency physician, it wasn't two hours until I got a call. It was a potential higher that was concerned about that. The second final point is that as damaging as the trouble retaining and recruiting physicians, it's also the attrition of our mirror senior experience positions, including doctors like myself who would love to continue to see patients for at least another 10 years, but who struggled with that decision given the ever present risks. Dr. A is one such physician, one of my prior partners who took very good care of a patient six years ago on a week in night shift, collected relevant information, examined, performed tests including CT scans, consulted neurology and admitted her to the ICU. Her total length of care lasted approximately three hours. The patient did have a bad outcome, unrelated to the care. And despite the fact that the doctor delivered ex-up care for six years through her attorneys, she received letters suggesting that she would end up, what the quote for a second, having to declare bankruptcy, suck up personal and professional pain and embarrassment in such public wording, and prepare to sell her house, pass out a retirement fund and declare bankruptcy. Thank you. You have a question. Really? Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. It was Dr. Cannon, right? Yes. I want to give you the credit of that doctor. Sure. I think one of the great tragedies in life is that we don't even though lawyers have a jurist doctor, we're not all doctor. Maybe we can pass a law. But Dr. Cannon, thank you for being here. You were talking about your carrier having this underfunded, not in a good financial situation. Is that MAG? No. Who is it? It's Curie. I'm sorry. Curie. Curie. Curie. Curie. Curie. Curie. Curie. Curie. Curie. Curie. I'm not sure if you're here other states. They're a national carrier. Recently, they emerged with Constellation, which was another large carrier out last. So they are, I believe, an off-air state. So they're going to be affected by things that are going on in other states, not just Georgia. But specifically, referring to the captive that we have with them in that cell that is only Georgia policies. Captive meaning. That means a self-insured fund for insurance. Okay. And if we wanted to follow up and get some more, because I'm not as familiar with them as I am MAG, we could follow up with your office. I'd be glad to. Okay. Thank you. It went partly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As a lawyer and a doctor, can you help me understand Section 7? I mean, it's in the bill. And so, you know, the concern, I'm... Is there a specific question, I guess, would be my... Will Section 7 result in Medicare and Medicaid patients receiving only catastrophic care or having care only in emergency rooms? I don't believe that Section 7 would offer those federal fundally programs, those patients, their access or what they've currently received now. I say that again. So I don't believe Section 7 fundamentally changes the access to care that patients with those federal funds programs, CMS and the state, currently have access to. Certainly. You know, with respect to compliance with federal law, but I think the effect of Section 7, the concern I'm raising is that it pushes more of these individuals based on how this payment is structured with respect to plaintiffs' insurance policy being provided as opposed to the defendants, with respect to how costs would otherwise be provided for. That's the understanding that I've been provided and so I'm just trying to get as much clarification, especially if this is going to harm the most vulnerable among us. Again, the patients with Medicare and Medicaid have a certain amount of... They have coverage, they have access to positions that participate in those programs. I don't see how Section 7 changes that. So, you know, throughout this hearing, I'm not a trial lawyer, but, you know, I've been hearing and learning that there's no causal link between tort reform and low insurance rates. But in fact, of course, we've seen in states, Medicaid expansion states versus non-Medicaid expansion states, lower health insurance premiums for citizens in those states that have expanded their Medicaid population, whether through public or private health insurance. Is it not also true that medical malpractice insurance rates are lower in states that have lower uninsured rates than in states like Georgia that has not taken action to cover its uninsured population? I haven't run that raid and I haven't seen that so I don't know. I would say that my experience in my groups experience and we practice with partner hospitals in the 17 different states is that states that have passed tort reform and that's in North Carolina, that's in Florida, that's in Texas, that was in our experience in Georgia back in 2005. Those states have more premiums. Well, I know Georgia has passed many different tort reform type pieces of legislation. I think what we have before in SB 68 is a whole nother ball game. But to take all that aside, again, you know, if you could provide additional information as to what is the primary driver or one of the larger contributing factors to hire medical malpractice insurance rates, that would be helpful for my own understanding in which a lot of the studies that I'm reading is that it's the uninsured population in which, you know, defensive medicine is more practiced where you have larger uninsured folks at your serving. Things of that nature as opposed to again, you know, this tort reform notion very broad term in which ultimately a lot of studies are saying there's no causal link. I would just again, from my personal experience in this ER position, patients come to see us 24 hours a day, seven days a week. I truly don't know what their insurance status is. It's not on the EMR, I guess I could go look it up or ask them. But to me, I'm truly agnostic in terms of what they have for insurance. I'm going to take care of them the same way every time. And so that doesn't factor in in terms of the care they receive, the defensive medicine or anything like that. You know, I will also say that, you know, from the Georgia experience that our group has and someone who sits on the claim committees and having, you know, the new information, again, as a December to look at how far behind those captives are, it's the trials. It's the cases, it's the verdicts. There's not, I mean, I'm sure you can come up and there's some percentage or some small amount. But weekend and week out, we are faced with cases where the decision to settle is not motivated by feeling that care is delivered well or poorly, but it's truly on the outcome and it's the math. And the math is such that if you look at the maximum verdict or the scary verdicts that are out there, the extinction verdicts that truly would interrupt our ability to practice and you multiply it by the percentage that the plaintiff wins, even if you think it's a very defensible case, at least 20 and 30 million dollar verdicts by a 10 percent is just, it's too risky. And those settlements have gone higher and higher over the last five years to the point where it is, it is certainly affecting our captive and other insurers' ability to keep up. So last comment, at least per the math and the information that I've been provided, payout per physicians had been roughly flat since 1992 to 2003. So again, I'm trying to get a better understanding as to how best we as a legislature, what actions we could take to address some of these really significant challenges in which I think more than anything, it is our large uninsured population that continues to drive a lot of these challenges. If I could just briefly respond, I would say number one, our experience with our group is that they haven't been flat, that we have seen increases. The second thing, and this gets back to kind of our difficulty with recruiting and retaining Georgia as a net exporter of medical students, it's a net exporter of residents, and it's certainly not the only issue, but more often than not, it is an issue. And even if they're rare and even if they're not in common, like we've had some other speakers say, you know, your weatherman says, look, it's lightning, but lightning only strikes a person one in a million, you still have to pay attention to the lightning, and it's still can scare people. This is scaring the doctors that will no longer practice, that will retire early, that will not move to the state and leave the state after medical school or residency, that we otherwise could have here taking care of Georgia's. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to the Google machine on my phone, I was able to find a little bit of information about Curry from Curry.com. And you were mentioning that there is this bad financial situation, but they're advertising on their website. Our financial success allows us to give these member distributions, and those have been since 2008, it says on their website, 51.7 million, and the most recent data available looks to be 2022, is 2.5 million, were you aware of that? And if things are so bad, why are we paying out distributions? I don't debate the fact that if Curry and other insurers, again, we've heard evidence are doing well, our captive in Georgia, who is only in Georgia, and covering Georgia positions, is not doing well. Well, but they're paying out these distributions to everybody. But it must not be so bad that they cover losses here. They don't say losses. I apologize for that. It's not so bad in North Carolina, maybe. Of course, not so bad in Texas, or other states that have passed before them, but here in Georgia, our captive is significantly in the whole, and it's not because of investment, it's because of the loss run rate, and the expected losses over the next five years. But they're not limiting distributions. I mean, they're giving those to everybody. They're not saying if you're in Georgia, you don't get it, right? Again, none of our Georgia positions that are covered are getting any sort of distributions or money back. None of them. No. Okay, we'll check on that. My last question you inspired, I didn't catch before that you were an emergency room doctor. An emergency room standard of negligence is gross negligence, right? In certain cases, yes. It's a pretty good liability protection, right? There's not any better standard on the doctor side than gross negligence is there? You would think in yet certain cases would bring that into question. But that's not going to change in this bill. That negligence standard. That's not addressed in this bill at all, no? In OBDYN's have that same standard, generally speaking. OBDYN's have that same standard. If the care is, I will just kind of say adjacent to someone who presents with an emergency whether it's in the emergency department, or perhaps an LND unit, again, that is unscheduled care, but not every LND patient would follow. And that's not going to change under this bill either. We're still providing that pretty good liability protection to doctors, true? That's great. Thank you. I think Representative Evans, thank you, Mr. Chairman, still my thunder a little bit about that question. But generally speaking, for a doctor to be sued, they're really not like many other tort feezers in the state of Georgia. They do get certain extra levels of protection when you agree with that. The ER standard, again, in certain cases is a different level of protection, yeah? Can you sue a doctor for simple negligence? Well, being negligent, yeah. It has to be below the standard of care, correct? Right. Right. And in order to sue a doctor, you have to get another doctor to give the opinion that that doctor performed below the standard of care. Is that also correct? And I would say that the numbers in these lawsuits and the verdicts that are being given out have created a situation where plaintiffs attorneys have a cadre of doctors who will say anything for money. Hmm. Okay, but I guess the question is in order for you to even sue a doctor, unlike any other person. Is that a competitive merit for the lawsuit? Correct. And so is it just plaintiffs' lawyers who are using experts that are, or is this like, is there data to support that plaintiffs' lawyers are using, I guess, experts that are not credible at a higher rate than defense lawyers? You seem to poo poo in another doctor's opinion. I've read a lot of affidavits, so that's all I can tell you about that. Okay. All right, you have no further questions. Thank you. Thank you. All right, that's the last of our witnesses. And so that will conclude tonight's hearing. And once I make a decision about what we're doing next, I will let everybody know. Until then, everyone, have a good evening.
