TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good afternoon, and hello to my Democratic colleagues who have taken the time out of their
busy schedule to join us today, to observe the anniversary of Roe versus Wade.
Fifty-one years ago, on January 22nd, 1973, the Supreme Court issued a landmark decision
in Roe versus Wade protecting a woman's constitutional right to choose.
The case reaffirmed basic principles of equality reinforced the fundamental right to privacy
and enabled women in this country to make deeply personal decisions, free from political
interference.
Since Roe was overturned by the Supreme Court justices that were handpicked by Republican politicians,
we've seen countless horrifying stories of women across this country, denied life-saving
care and doctors threatened with prosecution for simply doing their job.
This should not be happening, not here in Georgia, not anywhere in this nation.
Who would have thought that our granddaughters would be worst off than their grandmothers?
The state of reproductive freedom in Georgia at this particular time is untenable.
This is about our freedom to decide when, where and with whom to have a family.
I for one believe that a woman has a right to make that decision for herself.
Republicans believe politicians have the right to make our most personal decisions based
on their values.
We believe in a freedom to make our own decisions based on our faith and our values.
A woman forced to deliver a baby is over 10 times more likely to die.
One in 50 pregnant women who have an ectopic pregnancy could die because the fetus has
implanted itself somewhere where it doesn't belong.
Look, call me pro-life, pro-choice or pro-commonsense.
I just believe the government should not be telling a woman or a couple when they should
or shouldn't start a family based on someone else's interpretation of the scripture.
They believe fertilized eggs are people and they call themselves pro-life, but vote against
the lives of real babies and children.
Always voting against help for families to cover child care calls.
Always blocking laws preventing gunmen from killing children in our schools.
Make that make sense.
Democrats believe that life is more than a slogan and we will stop.
We will stop at nothing to restore reproductive freedom.
Now, while Republicans are running their anti-freedom agenda and taking away rights and dictating
women's private health care decisions, Georgia Democrats are committed to making sure
people have more rights, not fewer.
That's what will be on the ballot this November, and we're going to continue to make sure
that every single Georgian knows the states, I'll bring to the microphone our treasurer
She wrote.
Thank you, Leader Beverly.
Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us this afternoon.
Today, we commemorate what would have been the 51st anniversary
of the Roe v. Wade decision, a decision that correctly
recognized the right to abortion as a fundamental liberty.
It is still jarring as we stand here today
to realize that Georgia women no longer
enjoy the same reproductive freedom we did
for almost five decades.
We are going backwards and Republicans
under the gold dome are too blame.
Republican politicians in our state
enacted a near total abortion ban
completely stripping Georgia women of the right
to make their own health care decisions.
This issue is personal for so many Georgians.
It's really personal for me.
When I made my decision to terminate a pregnancy
for medical reasons, I was 37 years old.
My husband and I were thrilled when we found out
we were pregnant, but a little apprehensive
with the extra caution required when you're over 35.
After a 12-week ultrasound, we received a call
from our doctor, a blood test indicated
that the fetus had triced me 18, a chromosomal disorder,
my physicians classified as incompatible with life.
After receiving all the facts from my physicians,
they explained that essentially,
my pregnancy would end with the death of our child.
My husband and I had to decide what to do
with this devastating news.
What would the non-viable pregnancy do to my body
if we did not take medical action?
Is it worth risking my own life
and possibly leaving my children without a mother
only to delay the inevitable.
I knew what I had to do and scheduled the abortion.
I have absolutely no doubt in my mind
that it was the right decision for me
and my family, including my unborn child.
An impossible decision, I pray my daughters,
never have to make.
It is absolutely devastating to think
that the freedom to make these exact same healthcare decisions
has been revoked in the state of Georgia.
Had this happened to my family in 2024,
if I, like many Georgia women,
couldn't afford the costs of seeking care
in a state with reproductive freedom,
I would have been forced to stay pregnant,
forced to give birth against my own will
and at great risk to my own life.
I would have had to endure forced birth,
despite trained physicians recommending the contrary.
Georgia's near total abortion ban interferes
with a doctor's care, period full stop.
And even worse, many Republican politicians
serving under this gold dome right now
don't think Georgia's near total abortion ban is enough.
They will stop at nothing to ban all abortions
without exceptions for rape,
incess or to save the mother's life.
This is a five alarm fire and we will not remain silent.
I refuse for my daughter's generation
to be the first with fewer rights than their mothers.
And Georgians agree.
Most Georgians believe women should be able
to make their own health care decisions.
In fact, 77% of Georgia voters support reproductive freedom.
Time and time, again, it is clear that Republicans
around the wrong side of this, but they still dig their heels in.
And Republican politicians are who are competent to make health care decisions for Georgia women.
They will pay at the ballot box in November.
Meanwhile, Georgia Democrats will continue to fight to ensure we can all make our own
health care decisions.
Stay tuned for this legislative session.
We will stop it nothing to restore reproductive freedom.
That means using every tool in our toolbox, including enshrining fundamental protections
for reproductive freedom into Georgia law, repealing harmful abortion restrictions that create
barriers to care and making it easier for all Georgians to get the care they need.
Last session, the House and Senate filed HB 75 and SB 15 the Reproductive Freedom Act
that does all of those things and more, yet Republicans still refuse to give it a hearing
This is part of a pattern with Republicans under this gold dome.
America was founded as a representative democracy, but they are not representing the people.
My Republican colleagues are ignoring the facts and silencing the Georgia citizens who elected them.
Since they won't let the people speak on this issue, Georgia House Democrats will hold its own hearing on Wednesday at 2pm across the street of the Presbyterian Church.
Yes, you heard that correctly.
Republican leadership will not allow us to use
a committee hearing room in this house,
the people's house, even when no one else is using it.
Again, Republican politicians are doing everything
they can to silence the people,
and they were elected to represent them.
So my call to action today on this anniversary of row
is please contact the House Public Health Committee chair
and members, the speaker, the lieutenant governor,
Governor Kemp and demand they stop silencing the citizens of Georgia and give HB 75 a hearing.
Thank you all for standing with Georgia legislators today, and thank you for fighting with us
tomorrow to protect and restore reproductive freedom for Georgia for good.
Good afternoon, I am Representative Carl Gail Yara, the chairman of the Georgia Legislative
Black Caucus.
As my colleague said, it is an issue in this defining moment for we to people.
It's a constitution that says we to people in order to form a more perfect union, what
better union than to give a woman the right to choose.
Establish justice, ensure the message tranquillity,
where would justice have we gotten
when the people have spoken up
that they have a right to choose over their own bodies,
ensure the blessings of liberty to our self,
to our prosperity, do ordain and establish
this constitution of the United States of America.
And if America and Georgia establishes
something for the people, then it should be the right
to choose and not the right to abuse.
The woman that is standing in her position
of either choosing whether to or not to,
so many times we've been under these gold domes.
And as we represent over three million constituents
across Georgia with over 74 senators
and state representatives,
it isn't all that our colleagues must listen
to the voice and the will of the people.
Remove party lines and focus on human lines.
Those are human beings of those women
who should have the choice and the right to decide
over their own body.
As a father of daughters, they have a right to choose.
And as a husband to my wife, it is always essential
that we don't go through what they go through.
And so on today, the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus
stands in unity with our caucuses in the Senate
and in the House.
And today, we represent we, the people.
Good afternoon, I'm Senator Gloria Butler, I'm the leader of the Georgia Senate Democratic
caucus. Today, we gather to recognize the anniversary of Roe v. Wade. Not so long ago,
our gathering would have been a celebration. We would celebrate the decision that allowed
women to make choices about their own bodies and to determine the direction of their own
lives. We would celebrate the hard work that granted the honor of leaving our children,
our grandchildren, and our great-grandchildren with more freedoms and greater opportunities
than we had. Two years ago, the dogs overturned rope. It was a dark day for women in Georgia
and around the country.
All of us, from great grandmothers to great granddaughters,
felt anger at this loss.
The loss of our agency, our body, autonomy, our choice.
We could no longer tell future generations
that we're leaving behind a better world
than we've been given.
It was heartbreaking, but in days following
dog's decision, women did something amazing.
They turned their anger, their grief, their sadness
into action.
They continued fighting.
They continued organizing and demanding the fundamental
rights to which women are entitled.
If the Supreme Court says that the states are capable
of making these decisions for themselves,
we, women in Georgia, and in every state in the U.S.,
we are never going to stay silent to paraphrase.
Over the last two years, we have persisted,
and we have protected our rights to reproductive freedom.
all over the country, in Michigan, Ohio, and Kansas.
We put abortion rights on the ballot,
and let those who are deprived of their rights
have their voices be heard.
And we want, every time, this year, voters in New York
and Maryland would do the same in other states, including Georgia,
Republican governments have spent millions of taxpayer dollars defending unpopular and
overly restricted abortion laws and courts.
Last year we joined this fight to elevate the voices of the people and do whatever we
can to ensure our voices are heard and honored.
That is why I introduced Senate Resolution 136, which will allow Georgians to decide
whether we want to protect reproductive freedom
by enshrining in our state's constitution.
This fall of a long tradition of protecting our patients
rights in Georgia.
In 1876, we were the very first state in the union
to recognize the right to privacy in one's own medical
decision-making.
We seek to uphold that legacy of respect and dignity
in health care by allowing women and their families
to decide what is best for themselves.
That is why we are proud to hold heartedly
support the measure of putting reproductive rights
on the ballot, to let the people and women decide
what they want for themselves.
Because we actually trust the people of Georgia
to do what is best for themselves and their families.
Unfortunately and unsurprisingly,
Republicans ignore Senate Resolution 136.
They silence Georgians and allow this resolution
to sit untouched, unheard, and unconcited for one for a year.
Why?
Because Republicans don't want the people to make the rules.
Republicans want everyone to live by their rules,
by their moral codes, to acquire you to walk the path
that they think is best for you.
It is Democrats, not Republicans, who defend
that most cherished and American ideal of freedom.
This afternoon, let us celebrate all women across our country
who continue demanding the rights owed to them
under the Constitution.
In honor of the women who fought so hard to make
role possible, let this be the legacy it leaves behind.
Then when those in positions of authority
deny women the power of their own bodies,
lives and our futures they ignite a discipline and energy and a fury in our
spirits that has for centuries guided women to do what we do best get the job
done to all those who have stood beside us and fought to restore the
freedoms guaranteed by roll to those who have spoken up and demanded the
the voices of the people be heard,
I want to say sincerely to you, thank you.
God bless the women of this state who keep fighting
and God bless the women of this country that keep fighting.
Thank you.
I stand before you with the heavy heart yet fiercely determined.
I am proud to be the youngest woman to serve in the Georgia Senate.
This has often afforded me a unique perspective, not just on reproductive rights, but on all
issues facing Georgia families.
I am speaking out to ensure that women's stories and relived experiences remain at the
center of this conversation.
Today should have been a day of celebration, the 51st anniversary of GroVee Wade, a landmark
decision that empowered millions of women and families across our nation.
And instead, we find ourselves in throws of a relentless war on women and families waged
by our governor and a Republican-led legislature, Helbet, on turning back the clock on our rights.
We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the real consequences that are unfolding across this
state. Many of my GOP colleagues are comfortable turning a blind eye to these issues of reproductive
freedom because they are out of sight and out of mind. But let me tell you that these
issues are front and center if you're a woman in Georgia right now. Over the last two
years, women and girls, my peers, my constituents and friends across the state have shared their
stories with me. The woman who came to Georgia for vacation from out of state and started
to miscarry at eight weeks, she flew home bleeding rather than seeking care here. The woman
who found out she was pregnant at six weeks and one day because it took her so long to
get her health insurance.
The woman who miscarried and started to become septic at Atlanta hospital while doctors
debated when and if they were legally allowed to intervene to help her.
The teenage girl, not a woman, a girl who had to figure out how to apply for a grant
to be able to afford to get on a plane for the first time so she could end a pregnancy
she could not have.
Three over a century ago, the first woman was elected to the Georgia State Legislature,
and since then, women have fought tirelessly in these halls for the rights and well-being
of women and families.
Yet, today, we are under siege, access to safe abortion care, family planning, sex
education, and even basic medical facilities is being systemically dismantled.
Georgia now bears the shameful burden of having one of the nation's worst infant and
maternal mortality rates.
Our counties are devoid of essential OBGYN care,
and doctors are fleeing our state,
fear and criminal prosecution,
for providing necessary medical services.
This is not absurd.
It's a crisis.
This must stop.
I love Georgia, and I refuse to sit by and raise my family
in a state that does not value the women, girls,
and families that form its backbone.
We are on the brink of change.
Since adopts decision every time the people have been given a vote on abortion rights, it has led to expansion, not restriction.
Politicians have been ousted, bans blocked, all by the will of people.
The majority in Georgia believe in safe legal abortions.
They believe in a family's right to make decisions without government interference.
What the GOP has done in Georgia is a step too far, and we will not stand idly by.
We stand on the shoulders of those who fought for Roe v. Wade, women who believed in the
sanctity of personal privacy in the control of their own bodies.
And we will not let their fight be vain.
We will not let our medical infrastructure be frozen in the 19th century, and we will
not stand by as extreme laws but women's lives at risk.
This is our call to action.
This is our moment to stand up, to fight back, to ensure voices are heard.
We will not be silenced.
We will not be sidelined.
We will fight for our rights, for health, and for our freedom.
We must protect our democracy, our rights, and our bodies.
And the GOP may have won a battle, but they cannot win this war.
We are resilient, we are powerful, and we are many.
We will persist, and we will prevail.
Thank you.
We have a couple of questions, do you have a question?
Yes, sir.
Give our legislation and resolutions a hearing.
Let the people actually come and speak in the people's house
house and tell them how they want to be represented.
Thank you.
