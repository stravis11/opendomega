TRANSCRIPT
----------
As you all know, this is my final time speaking to you in the state of the State of Dress as your governor.
Some of you may be more happy about that than others.
But I hope you know that it has been an incredible honor for Marty, the girls, and me to serve
as your first family.
Governor Brian Kemp delivered his final state of the state address today, a speech that
mixed policy, personal reflection, and emotion from his family in the gallery.
Good evening and welcome to this special one-hour edition of lawmakers.
Thank you for joining us.
I'm Donna Lowry in Atlanta.
His remarks, the governor looked back at his two terms, leading the state, highlighting
accomplishments, and laying out key budget priorities for the year ahead.
Tonight will break down what the governor said and what it means.
Two political analysts will join us to put the speech into context.
We'll also hear the Democratic response.
But first, a look at how the day unfolded under the gold dome.
Our correspondent, Sarah Callis, has the overview from the Capitol.
It was a wild day at the Capitol today, Donna.
It wasn't just a frenetic activity that usually surrounds the governor's state of the state
address, but also the keep Georgia wild event this morning, which brought its own bit
of wild to the Gold Dome.
Lawmakers brought in a variety of wildlife and outdoor conservation groups today, including
the state's Department of Natural Resources, all sharing with lawmakers and those gathered
at the Capitol, the importance of enjoying and protecting Georgia's wild spaces.
I want them to learn about new animals that they've never seen before.
We like a lot of people have never seen a broadwing this close before.
I want them to learn about the native wildlife that's around them.
And I also just want them to be happy.
I want them to enjoy what's around them.
Animal ambassadors were on hand as well.
A snake, turtle and alligator as well as the broadwing hawk.
Ron display for educational and enjoyment purposes.
It was then on to the day's main event,
the Senate joined House members together in the House
to hear Governor Brian Kemp's final state of the state.
A head of Governor Kemp's swan song, he received a cheerful welcome in the House chamber.
The annual speech gives lawmakers a clear view of the governor's priorities for the legislative
session. This year, Kemp also looked back on his successes.
lower taxes, pay raises for state workers and teachers, economic development and
public safety were all touched on as accomplishments during his tenure.
There is no question the state of our state is stronger, more prosperous, and
safer today than it was in January of 2019.
Thank you all.
But also I want to be clear, this success, this good news isn't guaranteed.
It doesn't happen by default or accident.
There's more work to be done and more wood to chop, to make sure Georgia continues to
be the best place to live, work and raise a family for generations to come.
Kemp announced a first of its kind need-based scholarship in his speech,
garnering cheers from the audience.
My amended budget proposal invests $325 million in the university system of
Georgia's Dream Scholarship Program. The first need-based scholarship of
its kind in Georgia history. He also touted another state tax rebate.
his fourth during his two terms as governor, which would give back taxpayers
between $250 to $500. He rounded out his speech by centering on his faith,
which he says has guided his decisions well in office by reciting an excerpt from the him
little is much when God is in it. Does the place you're called to labor seems so small and little
known? Well, it is great if God is in it and he will not forsake his own.
the speech marked the beginning of Kemp's goodbye to the governorship.
While he said he expects his term to be a small part of Georgia history, his colleagues
disagreed.
He said you may not be remembered in history.
I think you will.
And we're going to help tell the story.
After the address, Democrats gave their perspective.
While they praised some aspects of the speech, such as the need-based scholarship, they say
other areas were ignored.
Did you hear anything about health care?
We have been talking about expanding Medicaid year after year.
And we know that the ACA subsidies have expired.
There are cuts to Medicaid coming down to us from the federal government.
That's a real challenge and I'm surprised that it was not mentioned.
Later in the afternoon, more wildlife of a sort
as the winners of the High School Georgia State Parks and Historic Sites
art contest were announced on the South Steps. Works from the students were on
display and covered a wide variety of outdoor subjects. Over 230 students
submitted their work for this year's contest. Tomorrow lawmakers will be back
at the Capitol for day five. They will honor Dr. Martin Luther King at their
annual MLK Day ceremony. That's my capital report. Back to you, Donna.
Thanks Sarah. Governor Brian Kimms, 2026 State of the State address highlighted everything
from Georgia's strong fiscal position to significant investments in education, workforce
development, and public safety. Joining me to listen to portions of his roughly 45-minute
speech and to offer analysis are two political consultants.
Bureau Amber is a senior vice president and is part of the Georgia government relations
team with McGuire Woods Consulting.
He previously served as chief of staff to the late house speaker David Roelston and
to current speaker John Burns.
And Anne Trel Tyson is a senior policy advisor at Paramount Consulting.
He previously served as a regional director with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
under the Biden administration.
Thank you both for being here.
Appreciate this.
So let's start with each of you giving me a brief idea
of overall what you thought of the speech.
Spiro?
Yeah, confident, optimistic, I think a vision
for finishing his term and finishing the race strong.
Okay, what about you?
Yeah, I agree.
Definitely it was a strong message.
I felt like it was definitely a swan song
where you kind of went over some of his accomplishments.
And then it was also a few pieces of it
where you could say that he was established in his legacy.
Yeah, he's focused a lot on his legacy, I think.
Okay, well, let's listen to one of the topics
the governor addressed early in his remarks, taxes.
Since 2021, working together with this General Assembly,
we have provided one time tax relief to the tune
of over $3.2 billion.
Property tax relief, nearly $1 billion.
Over 2.2 billion in motor fuel tax suspensions
and a permanent income tax savings of nearly $3.4 billion.
That's almost $9.7 billion that have helped hard work
in Georgia and fight through the record-high inflation,
forced upon all of us by the previous administration in DC
and a Congress that couldn't put down the nation's credit card.
These are historic investments in families.
Recent college graduates looking to start a career.
Our seniors on fixed income and single parents
just trying to make ends meet.
But these investments were possible
because we rejected the idea that just because government
takes in more money, it shouldn't turn right around
and spend it on more government.
California may think that way.
New York may think that way.
But in Georgia, we do things differently.
We keep your tax burden low.
We budget conservatively and responsibly.
And we ensure that state government is efficient
with the dollars that you trust us with.
And at the end of the day, if we have more than we need, we give it back to the people
who actually earned it.
As Marty, the girls in our travel all across our state, we hear from Georgians in all walks
of life, hard-working people trying to put food on the table for themselves and their families.
And the reality is that too many of our citizens are still struggling to make ends meet each
and every day because costs are still too high.
Groceries, rent, insurance, clothes for the kids, it all adds up to more than it used
to.
That's why my budget proposal will include a fourth, one-time, $1 billion tax rebate
this year that will return or save the average file or $250 in a married couple up to 500.
With this rebate, my administration and this General Assembly will have returned over
for $7.5 billion in surplus revenue
to the taxpayers of our state over the last four years.
We also know that one time relief is a short-term solution
that recognizes the state has collected more
of your tax dollars than it needs
to fund our priorities and save
for whatever the future may bring.
We must continue doing everything in our power
to allow the hard work in men of our state
to keep more of their hard-earned money
their pocket in the years to come. Because as I've said before, that's your money, not
the governments. That's why my administration will also be proposing a further 20 basis
point reduction in our state's personal and corporate income tax rate, bringing it down
to just 4.99%. This will fulfill a promise to the people of the state that I made during
my reelection campaign to lower our state income tax rate to under 5%. And with the
The General Assembly's passage in my signature, it will come a full three years ahead of schedule.
This tax cut doesn't promise to pay for itself years down the road, or create future budget
holes with today's one-time money.
Our plan fulfills my promise to the voters of this state in a responsible way, and most
importantly, this plan puts all the hardworking people of our state first.
The reason that we've been able to do this and through it three years ahead of schedule
is because of our fiscal discipline.
It's also worth noting a few other important accomplishments that the last few years may
not have made headlines or please some of those that constantly advocate for bigger government.
Even with the rebate and tax cuts that my office will propose this legislative session,
Our state's rainy day fund and strategic reserves will still stand at over $10 billion.
These reserves are four time higher than any administration will leave behind in our
history, and enough to run state government for three full months.
When the storms of tomorrow come, it is my hope that we will share in a commitment to
keeping the state we all love on that firm foundation.
Our state reserves are just one area that we have made historic strides in to set Georgia
up for future success and prosperity.
From the 2024 budget through the proposed amended 26 budget, $4.1 billion in capital projects
have been funded through cash instead of debt.
This strategic investment will save Georgia taxpayers and future state appropriators $3.3
billion in interest payments over the next 20 years.
The cash funding of capital projects we began in fiscal year 2024 has allowed us to reduce
outstanding debt by over 20 percent in just three years.
And the ratio of our state's debt service to revenues is just 3 percent.
The lowest since the state began issuing debt bonds in the 1970s.
These savings were all made while implementing historic tax cuts, returning billions to
tax payers and investing over $6 billion in water, sewer and transportation projects across
the state. Refusing to grow government, budgeting conservatively and paying off debt aren't
flashy. They don't get you on the cable news, make you famous on social media or fit on
a bumper sticker. And that might be the reason Washington has been so allergic to them.
But I learned a long time ago building houses that it's better to be a workhorse than a
show horse. Because workhorse's deliver results ahead of schedule under budget and do right
by the customer. And that's exactly what we have been doing together for the people of
our state.
So a lot of things there that will make a lot of people happy. Another tax rebate and
$7.5 billion in rebates over the last four years. What did you think? What do you
have to say?
So I think it's a good thing that we started to see more of our elected officials talking
about the issue of affordability.
But I think the difference is how do we get there?
How do we provide relief to Georgians?
And it was cleared through the governor's statements
that he believes in giving back more money that we earn.
And I don't have a problem with that.
But then there's a tradeoff.
Then are there other things that we could be funding
to help some of those people who, if you give back their whole
check, it still won't be enough when it comes to affordability?
So I think that while it is great,
We will not turn away the money that he's gonna offer,
but I think we should also consider
what other things could we be paying for,
like childcare, health care to also help Georgians.
Okay, another tax rebate,
another tax rate cut that's ahead of schedule,
what he expected to do.
Yeah, these truly are historic times.
Georgia's been blessed with a healthy economy
due to sound physical policies now
for the last decade, really two decades.
And Governor Kemp, you know,
thank the General Assembly for their help
on his initiatives.
And, you know, by reducing the income tax even more,
it's gonna continue to make Georgia a competitive.
That was an initiative that was started
in the house many years ago.
It's a promise that Governor Kemp made.
And I think as he articulated today,
these are promises that he has made
and that he's delivering on.
and that's another thing where he's looking back
at how he did over the years.
Yeah, and the other thing is affordability.
It's something both sides of the aisle
are talking about.
Talk about that a little bit.
Yeah, I mean, I think anytime you can cut taxes,
as Governor Kim said,
and not increase the size of government,
I think that helps everyone.
It makes, you know, it keeps allows folks
to keep more money in their pockets
to spend in the economy,
which stimulates the economy.
and I think there have been investments
that have been made, whether it be transportation,
infrastructure, mental health care.
There have been investments that the state has made
while at the same time cutting taxes.
Okay, affordability, everybody has their own idea
it seems of what that means.
Yeah, and I think, you know, the good thing about it
is that we have 37 more days to figure it out.
I think Republicans have their proposal,
and I know Democrats will become to the table
with their proposals, and we hope
that at the end of this 40-day session,
that there's some agreement that could be made
to help the citizens in Georgia out.
Yeah, it's an election year,
it seems to be interesting that.
Okay, now let's hear what the governor had to say
about workforce issues.
During my administration,
we have reduced our state employee turnover rate
by over 25%.
All while keeping the size of our full-time state workforce
at 2019 levels.
We've invested in a vital workforce,
saved taxpayer dollars in training
and equipping new employees,
and utilized innovative and innovation and technology
to better deliver state services.
Our state employees have done an incredible job
and unprecedented times,
and are one of the driving forces behind Georgia's success.
That is why today I'm proposing a one-time
$2,000 pace supplement for all state employees,
including our educators and state public safety officers.
This is just another reminder on top of the pay raises and supplements we have provided
in years past that their hard work does not go unnoticed and that we are truly thankful.
Over the last seven years, Georgia has seen over 219,219,700 new jobs in more than $118
billion in investment from projects worked by the state economic development team.
64% of those jobs, in 75% of those investment dollars,
are going to communities outside the Metro Atlanta region.
Since 2019, we've welcomed the three largest
economic development projects in state history,
and continued Georgia's streak as an unborn state for business
for an unprecedented 12 years in a row.
But here in the best state for business,
We don't just welcome big companies.
We also champion small businesses
that have a big impact on local communities.
A great example of that is La Regina,
an Italian food production company
with a facility in Alma, Georgia
that employs 110 hardworking men and women.
This facility also happens to be a former bakery
that went out of business years ago.
To that community of less than 4,000 people,
the loss of an employer like that can be devastating.
But because we prioritize economic development
in rural Georgia, Laursy and it came in
and revitalized that facility
and created 110 jobs that are making a real
and lasting difference with more on the way.
The impact of this small business extends far beyond
Alma's borders.
In addition to moving plenty of goods
through the ports of Savannah.
La Rosina also purchases local produce
from over 100 Georgia farmers,
including more than 40,000 pounds of onions per week.
With touch points throughout that region of our state,
that one small employer produced a record
25 million jars of pasta sauce last year alone.
When Marty and I went to Southern Italy in 2024, we visited the headquarters of this
family-owned and operated business.
We talked to the men and women who had preserved their family's recipes for over 100 years.
And we saw how similar their values were to the very family-owned farms and businesses
here in Georgia that La Rosina supports.
That company, a full ocean away from our state, has the same values that we do.
Family, community, and a strong belief in a hard day's work.
Today we're joined by two La Rosina company leaders who represent how small town Georgia
and international markets truly connect, all to the benefit of our workers.
And the gallery is a mediae Renaldi, chief operating officer of Law Resina who has moved
his entire family to our great state.
He is joined by Jerry Lady, the plant manager, an employee one for Law Resina at Georgia's
facility.
You'll be glad to know that Jerry was the former bakery manager for the company that closed
down.
Well, both of you please stand and let us thank you for your investment in our state.
So a lot of talk about economic development, certainly in his term, he has done a lot in
that area.
So let's talk about that a little bit.
But first, this $2,000 supplement to all state employees one time, supplement.
Yeah, that's big.
I think that shows, you know, that Governor Kemp is prioritizing our state employees.
He made promises to raise teacher pay, which he's done every year.
And in addition to that, all state employees, we've had a problem with retention in some
areas in state governments.
So I think this is an effort to make sure that those state government workers are recognized
for the hard work that they do and incentivize them
to stay on the job.
Yeah, corrections is a big area
where there is a need for this money, yeah.
I'm not sure how much they may need
a little bit more in that area,
but we'll see.
We'll get all these a little more.
Next week, next week is budget week,
so we'll see if they talk about that.
Your thoughts on some of what he talked about,
let's starting with this pace up a little bit.
Yeah, I agree.
State employees, they definitely deserve it.
However, I do agree with you as well
the day probably need a little more. As a former government official, I can understand the
sacrifices that you make when you decide to become a civil servant and work for the government.
And so, yeah, they should definitely be paid for their sacrifice. And I think that, you
know, while $2,000 is good, I think they're probably, we circular back and ask for a little
more.
One of the things he's done, and he talked about it, 65% of the jobs that have come in have
been outside of Georgia, and really needed another parts of Georgia.
Yeah, I mean, I think what he's talking about.
Metro Atlanta, I'm sorry.
I said.
Sure.
People want to be safe.
They want to have a good job.
It's debatable.
Which order those are in.
They want to have good schools.
And it shouldn't matter what zip code you live in.
And I think the investments that he's talking about show that he's committed to not
just the Metro regions of the state, but also the rural areas.
Have you been down there around the Hyundai Meta Plan?
I have.
It's incredible.
It's enormous.
Yeah.
Absolutely. And I think that's one thing that both sides of the aisle can and can agree on that Georgia has been a great place for businesses to come and bring their
Opportunities to Georgia. I just you know want to also hope I just hope that the there's a plan to make sure that we're training up Georgians to be able to fill those jobs when those
Companies come and not allow those companies to continue to ship in their workforce as well. Yeah, you wonder after the speech how many people are going to look for a
for a loragina sauce around the state.
And those probably by daily unknowns that are in there.
Okay.
As the governor had talked about the past five, eight years,
he put a focus, a strong focus on the largest part
of the state budget, and that is the education budget.
Here's what he had to say about that today.
And one of the biggest reasons these job creators
of all sizes, cheese Georgia, is our highly skilled
and reliable workforce.
Over the last seven years,
We put more money toward education and workforce training programs than ever before in the history of our state.
In fact, as of this current fiscal year, we have not only fully funded QBE seven times,
but added $368 million to programs and initiatives that directly prepare workers for good jobs.
We also set new precedents when it comes to school safety.
Starting with the first year of my administration, we began with three campus
security grants totaling $184.5 million, and then added $109 million into the
base budget. So every school system can plan for how to best keep our classrooms
and all of the children in them safe. We will again fulfill that commitment in
this year's budget, bringing the total amount that we have allocated to school
safety during my time in office to over five hundred and eleven million dollars.
Thank y'all.
I also want to take a moment to also congratulate and thank the members of this
body, both past and present, who joined my administration in achieving something that
not many people thought was possible when I was sworn in as governor seven years ago.
In fact, when I pledged in 2018 to raise a teacher pay by $5,000, I remember a former
opponent of mine claiming I was making false promises to our educators across the state.
Well, in a way, the media and the doubters were right.
We didn't raise the teacher paid by $5,000.
We raised it by $9,500.
This historic investment in our educators increased the starting salary for a
Georgia teacher by almost 28%. And you don't have to get an A in math to know
that that's an impressive jump. In addition to K through 12, we've also made
historic investments in our post-secondary education institutions and
programs while reducing costs for students and families. Over the last several
years, we have worked together to return the hope scholarship to 100% of its promise.
All while the border regents has held tuition, cost, and check across the system, so greater
opportunity in Georgia can remain affordable.
Contrast that with other states that have again and again raised cost of higher education.
All while in place and reached 40-year highs under the prior administration.
The University of California, for instance, raised tuition by roughly 19% between 2019 and
the current academic year.
But here in Georgia, tuition is increased by just 5% in that same period.
And your partnership in eliminating the special institution fee helped us lessen the impact
on those increases on hardworking families and students.
In fact, data from the National Center for Educational Statistics shows that Georgia is
one of the top states in the country for four-year public university affordability.
All while we've kept the cost of higher education and check, and college within the reach of
Georgia families, we've also invested more in post-secondary
education than ever before. We're now putting 2 billion additional dollars toward higher education
in Georgia than when I first took office. That includes 40.7 million dollars in this year's budget
proposal, a loan for healthcare education facilities and medical workforce training programs.
And since I first took office, we spent over 26 million dollars for medical residency slots in
our state, adding 897 positions for a grand total of 2,523 residency slots as of this fiscal
year. This year my budget proposal adds another $2.1 million to further this upward trend
in such a critical workforce need. Along with these unprecedented investments, Georgia
is truly the national leader in merit-based aid for higher education between the Hope Scholarship
and grant programs. But in this era of high prices and new challenges for those graduating
from high school, we also recognize the advantage that need-based financial assistance can give
to those who would not otherwise be able to access higher education. Like there appears
who have the means to attend college. These students have great dreams for rewarding
careers in impactful lives, but they don't always have hope that those dreams can become
a reality. Dreams without the benefit of hope remain dreams deferred perhaps for entire
generations. How much richer would the lives of those and their families be if they could
to obtain the type of education that leads to a high paying job with great benefits.
And how much would communities across our state benefit from these young people getting
a degree that opens their door or starts a rewarding career?
I believe we owe it to every child to ensure they start out on a level playing field,
no matter their zip code.
Therefore my amended budget proposal invests $325 million in the University System of
Georgia's Dream Scholarship Program.
The first need-based scholarship of this kind, in Georgia history.
In future years, this one-time endowment will create opportunities for generational
economic advancement for thousands of students. And down the road it will allow them to complete
college and begin meaningful careers without the burden of crippling death. The dream scholarship
will build on the incredible unmatched legacy of the Hope Scholarship and leave no stone unturned
when it comes to student achievement in our state. From now on throughout the country,
Americans will know that hopes and dreams are alive right here in the great state of Georgia.
This unprecedented initiative, sorry, this unprecedented initiative will also complement
the Georgia Match program we launched in 2023.
In just the first two years of match,
we've seen a 5.9% rise in USG enrollment,
and a 7.1% increase in TCSG enrollment.
Meanwhile, other states around the country
have seen decreases in public university enrollment,
and 17 states are still well below pre-pandemic levels.
Lots about education there.
Let's start where he left off and that was higher education.
Now we have the hope and dream scholarship for students
who have needs-based, they need to go to college,
but they cannot afford it.
Absolutely.
I think this was actually the strongest part of his speech.
I think he got several bipartisan applaud
about the investment that he's making in higher education
and in the education system generally.
But yeah, I think for years, Democrats have been asking
for a needs-based scholarship program.
And it's great to see that the governor has decided
that this is something that is worth investing in.
And so I know that there are a lot of talent here in Georgia
that can stay in Georgia if they're given an opportunity
to pay for college based on a demonstrated need.
Yeah, they definitely have the skills,
the knowledge that they should be in college,
but they just can't get there.
Yeah, it's nice to see the governor taking the lead on this.
Commend him forward.
It certainly is a bipartisan issue and it shouldn't matter, you know, what party affiliation,
what ethnic background you are, what have you, everyone should have that opportunity
to get that, you know, higher education, whether it be technical colleges and a skilled
trade or, you know, a traditional four-year degree.
Yeah.
And then when it comes to K-12, he talked about all the money that has really gone into
teacher pay, it's really helped that amp safety in the schools.
Absolutely.
And as a child of an educator, I always applaud any pay raises that goes to teachers.
And as a matter of fact, I think teachers should be some of the highest paid professionals
that they are because our futures are literally in their hands.
So definitely applaud the governor for making that investment as well.
And safety is absolutely important when we're talking about keeping our kids safe.
And that's really a big part of his legacy,
what he's done in education, higher end, and K-12.
Absolutely, and as a parent of a student who's
in the university system, I'm particularly appreciative
of, you know, the investments, I mean,
the hope scholarship, and certainly the school's safety issue
in recent years has been at the forefront
in these investments, I think, or critical
in this time period.
OK, well, we're going to keep going,
but coming up, we'll have the democratic response
to the state of the state message.

We are continuing with our special one-hour edition of lawmakers focused on the state-of-the-state
address. Joining me again for analysis are Spiro Amburn, a senior vice president with McGuire
Woods consulting, Georgia government relations team, and Andrew Tyson, a senior policy adviser
at Paramount Consulting. So we're rolling along, but now we're going to switch gears a
little bit. And as always, Georgia Public Library casting live streamed both the governor's
address and the democratic response. Here now is the Democratic take from House Majority
leader, I'm sorry, House Minority Leader Caroline Hugley of Columbus.
Good afternoon Georgia. Today we heard Governor Kim's vision for our state. We heard about
tax cuts and infrastructure. We heard about Georgia's business climate and economic growth.
We heard the language of success. But here's what we didn't hear. How much of it is making
your life more affordable.
Because while the governor celebrates his record,
Georgia families will sit at their kitchen tables tonight,
doing math that doesn't add up,
working more hours, but failing, falling further behind.
Choosing between prescriptions and groceries.
Wondering if they'll ever be able to afford a home
in the communities where they grew up.
After more than two decades of Republican control
in the state.
It's time for an honest accounting.
Not of what they've done for their donors
and the well-connected, but of what they fail to do for you.
Let me be direct.
Georgia families are in an affordability crisis.
And Republican leadership refuses to even name it.
The Alice Essentials Index, which
tracks the real cost of survival, not luxuries,
shows that in Georgia, the cost of basic necessities
has grown at 7.3% annually.
That's faster than the national inflation rate,
and it's far faster than wages for working Georgians.
Housing costs are crushing young families and seniors alike.
Healthcare premiums keep rising.
Childcare calls more than college tuition.
groceries that used to cost $100 now cost $250.
And prescription drugs force impossible choices
every single month.
Governor Kim will tell you the economy is strong.
And for some Georgians, it is.
But strength is not measured by how well the top is doing.
It's measured by whether the middle can hold
and whether the bottom has a ladder up.
By that measure, after 20 years of Republican rule,
Georgia is failing working families.
Now, Republicans want you to believe
they have the answer, more tax cuts.
The governor will tout his income tax cuts
as a whim for everyday Georgians.
But let's follow the money.
The wealthiest Georgians got the biggest benefits.
Meanwhile, working families got a few dollars a month.
not enough to cover the rising cost of rent,
not enough to pay for child care,
not enough to matter when everything else is more expensive.
And here's what they don't tell you.
Every dollar they could in taxes is a dollar they can't invest
in public schools, in health care, in child protection,
or in keeping your community safe.
They're trading Georgia's future
for political talking points today.
When the next recession comes, and it will come, we will have fewer resources to respond,
fewer tools to protect families, fewer options to keep Georgia strong.
That's not fiscal responsibility, that's fiscal malpractice.
But it gets worse.
After years of income tax cuts that primarily benefited the wealthy, Republicans are now
floating property tax cuts that shift the burden on to local communities. Let me be clear
about what this means. While they cut taxes for the top, they're increasing the pressure on
homeowners, renters, and local governments to make up the difference. This is not tax relief.
This is cost shifting and working Georgians always end up holding the bag. They claim these
These solutions, but solutions don't leave families worth off.
Solutions don't protect the wealthy while squeezing the middle class.
Solutions don't promise relief while raising your costs somewhere else.
After 20 years in power, if their tax policies were working, Georgia's families wouldn't
be struggling to afford the basics.
they are, because Republican priorities are not your priorities.
No where is this disconnect more evident than in health care.
Right now hundreds of thousands of working Georgians are trapped in the coverage gap, earning
too much from Medicaid but too little to afford private insurance.
These are caregivers, service workers, rule Georgians doing everything right and still
left behind. Governor Kemp's alternative, Georgia Pathways, has been an unmitigated disaster.
After 18 months, only 6,500 people enrolled. 75 percent below projections and three quarters
of the spending went to consultants, not here. Meanwhile, 18 rural hospitals have closed
since 2013. Mothers are traveling hours to deliver babies. Emergency rooms are shutting
down and Georgia ranks near the bottom nationally in maternal mortality, with women dying from
preventable causes.
This didn't happen by accident.
This is the result of policy choices.
Choices Republicans made.
Choices they defend.
The federal ACA subsidies that help hundreds of thousands of Georgia's afford insurance
are expired.
This administration has offered no plan, none.
If you lose your coverage, if your premium's double,
if your local hospital closes, that's not an act of God.
That's the consequence of leadership
that prioritizes ideology over people.
Let's talk about Georgia's children,
because if we cannot protect and invest in them,
We have no claim to leadership.
Our foster care system is in crisis.
The Department of Human Services faces an $85 million deficit.
The Kemp administration has stopped providing services to foster children.
Children who are ready to reunite with their families are being forced to stay separated.
Medical appointments are being delayed, canceled or left unpaid.
and why cost overruns.
Instead of coming to legislative partners,
instead of making the tough budgeting choices,
leadership requires, he tried to hide the problem.
He swept it under the rug and hope, no one would notice.
But children notice.
Children notice when they can't go home,
when they can't see a doctor,
when their adults who are supposed to protect them fail.
Because of this incompetence,
children will languish in care longer than necessary.
They will suffer emotional harm that could have been prevented.
Case plans will stall.
Families working to regain stability will lose momentum.
Long standing providers who serve these vulnerable children
will go under and defects workers already overwhelmed
will buckle under impossible caseloads.
This problem should have been solved months ago,
but it wasn't, so now we have to clean up their mess
and Georgia's children are paying the price.
The challenges don't end there.
In the past seven years,
childcare costs have skyrocketed.
Parents most often mothers are being forced
to lead the workforce entirely,
just to care for their children.
That means loss income today and lower wages for life.
Georgia families need clean, safe, certified child care
with well-played staff.
They can actually afford and depend on.
At the same time, too many Georgia children
are not reading on grade level by third grade,
a known predictor of poverty, incarceration,
and loss potential.
And instead of strengthening the public schools
that educate 90% of Georgia's children,
This administration is diverting public dollars
to private school vouchers.
This is not school choice.
This is abandonment.
Rule schools lose funding.
Urban schools face overcrowding.
Special education services are strained,
and the students left behind,
overwhelmingly low income, black and brown,
are told to make do with less.
You cannot claim to care about Georgia's children
while undermining the very systems
meant to protect and educate them.
And we must talk about democracy itself.
Since Republicans took control,
they have systematically made it harder to vote.
Longer lines, fewer drop boxes, more barriers,
more intimidation.
A government that fears its own voters
is a government that has lost its way.
They say it's about security,
but we all know what it's about, control.
When you can't win on ideas, you change the rules.
When you can't persuade, you suppress.
Georgia's strength has always been in its people,
but if you solace the people, you hollow out the state.
Here's what the 20-plus years of Republican control and seven years of Governor Brian Kemp
has given us.
Working families falling further behind while the wealthy get tax cuts, hundreds of thousands
of Georgia's trapped without health care, 18 rural hospitals closed with more at risk,
a foster care system in collapse, public schools stripped of funding while private schools
get subsidies, maternal mortality rates that shame a state this wealthy, voting rights under
constant attack, immigrant communities targeted even as they fuel our economy.
Gun violence, rising while solutions are dismissed. This is not a record to run on. This is a record
to run from.
Georgians have had enough.
And now, as Carl Spiral and Family Struggle,
their answer is the same as it's always been.
More tax cuts for the top, more burden on the middle,
and more excuses for why government can't help.
Democrats have a different vision.
One rooted in the reality Georgia families live every day.
We believe affordability must be the standard
by which we measure every policy.
If it doesn't make life more affordable
for working families, we don't support it.
That means lowering the cost of healthcare
by fully expanding Medicaid,
capping prescription drug costs,
and investing in state funded programs
to reduce insurance costs.
It means keeping rural hospitals open
and addressing maternal mortality
as the crisis that it is.
Making housing affordable by increasing supply,
protecting renters from exploitation
and ensuring that home ownership is within reach
for young families and working Georgians,
not just investors and out-of-state buyers.
Investing in public education,
because strong schools make parents
don't have to pay for private alternatives,
because educated workers earn higher wages
and because no child should be left behind
based on their zip code.
Making child care affordable and accessible,
so parents can work without spending half their paycheck
on care, and so every child gets a strong start.
Ensuring working Georgians keep more of what they earn
through a tax system that is fair,
not one that cuts rates for the wealthy
while shifting burdens onto home wars and ridders.
protecting democracy.
So every Georgia's voice is heard,
every vote is counted,
and government remains accountable
to the people, not special interests.
This is not radical.
This is responsible.
This is what leadership looks like
when it serves the people, not the powerful.
The question is not whether Georgia has potential.
We all know it does.
The question is whether we will finally realize
that potential for all Georgians
or continue down a path that leaves working families behind.
Governor Kemp and Republican legislators
will tell you they've done enough that Georgia is strong,
that Georgia is the number one place to do business,
but I ask you this, if Georgia is so strong,
why are you struggling?
If the economy is booming, why can't you afford red?
If their policies are working, why does everything
cost more?
The truth is simple.
Their policies work for some Georgians, just not most Georgians.
After 20 years of the same priorities,
the same tax cut promises, the same refusal
to invest in health care, education, and in our children,
the results speak for themselves.
Georgia's families are doing their part.
They're working harder than ever.
They deserve a government that works just as hard for them.
House Democrats stand ready to lead on affordability, to make the investments Republicans refuse
to make, to protect the services they're trying to cut, to fight for the Georgia that works
for everyone, not just the well-connected.
We are fighting for affordable healthcare options.
We are fighting to fund public schools.
We are fighting to make housing and childcare affordable.
We are fighting to protect democracy and voting rights.
We are fighting to keep your calls down, not shift them around.
Because Georgia families and your children deserve nothing less.
This is not about partisan politics.
This is about priorities.
It's about who government serves, it's about whether we will finally meet this moment
with the courage and the honesty it demands.
20 years is long enough to judge a record.
And the record is clear.
It's time for new direction.
It's time to actually put Georgians first.
It's time for a government to work for you.
Thank you.
Minority Leader, Hugo Lee, focused not just on the governor's two terms, but on more
than two decades of Republican control of the state government.
Talk about that a little bit, and not just on these last seven years.
Yeah, and I think it's clear, you know, this is an election year.
She's making the case for leadership change, you know, if Democrats are in power, these
are the things that we will focus on, the how, you know, she did focus on affordability,
like we mentioned at the top of the show, but then she's making the case as to what
But what would be the issues Democrats focus on come November if elected and given the
seat of power?
Okay.
Your take?
Yeah.
You're exactly right.
Must be an election year.
I took some notes on that one.
You know, yeah.
The minority leader and the Democrats are trying to find some traction on education, health
care.
She talked a little bit about the foster care system.
But as Governor Kim articulated in his speech, talking about not just his term and the minority
leader reference, you know, the last 20 years, I mean, we've had record unemployment.
Higher education enrollment is up.
Unfortunately, we're going to have to leave it there.
Unfortunately, we're going to have to leave it there.
Yeah, maybe you guys can come back.
Thanks so much for coming on this show, because that does it for lawmakers today.
We don't have a show on Fridays, but the General Assembly will be in session tomorrow and
And look for alumnaker's capital report from Sarah Callis at the end of the PBS News
Hour about 6.55 p.m.
Have a good evening.
