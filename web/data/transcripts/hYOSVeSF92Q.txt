Our chapel in this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the one hundred and
tenth House District Representative Clint Crowe, Representative Crowe.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, good morning, colleagues.
I have the distinct pleasure today to welcome Dr. Benny Tate.
Dr. Tate has served for over 30 years as a senior pastor
of Rock Springs Church in Milner, Georgia.
The church has grown from 80 and attendance
to more than 8,000 under his leadership
and has seven campuses.
The following ministries are part of Rock Springs Church.
Rock Springs Medical Clinic.
Rock Springs Christian Academy.
The Potter's House for Women and Impact Street Ministry
to care for the homeless.
Dr. Tate serves as president of the Congregational Methodist
Denomination, and has served many times as chaplain
for the United States Senate.
The United States House of Representatives
of Washington, DC, here at the Georgia Senate
and here in this house.
Dr. Tate is authored five books most recently
to file the odds, which hopefully you all
have gotten a copy of.
If you haven't, please let us know.
Vinny and his wife Barbara have been married for over 35 years
and have one daughter, Savannah Abigail,
and they currently reside in Versailles.
And I cannot overstate how much he means personally to me
and my family.
Please welcome my pastor and my friend, Dr. Benitez.
Good morning.
Thank you so much for giving me this opportunity.
I have been coming to the Capitol for decades in speaking.
Perhaps you'd say, Pastor Benny, I've never heard you.
If you've never heard me, would you just slip your hand up?
Say, I've never heard you, yes.
I say to this group, what Elizabeth Taylor said
to her eighth husband, I'm not going to keep you long.
Amen?
But I would like to share a scripture that I think
is appropriate during this season.
It's in 1 Thessalonians, 1 Thessalonians chapter 5, verse 18.
It simply says this, in everything, give thanks.
Certainly not for everything,
but in everything, give thanks
for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus,
concerning you.
In everything, give thanks.
I just wanna take a few moments
and I wanna talk to you about thanksgiving day every day.
day. Thanksgiving day, every day. I want to say three quick things. First of all, it's
the will of God. It's the will of God. The Scripture says in everything, give things.
That means the good, the bad, the winds, the losses. In everything, give things. Sometimes
I think we're kind of like Snoopy. Snoopy the dog gets up on Thanksgiving day and he
looks in the window and he sees the family having Thanksgiving.
He looks in there and he sees Turkey and he sees dress and he sees pumpkin pie.
Snoopy's outside the window and he says, my goodness, here I am outside the window eating
dog food. They're inside having turkey and dress and pumpkin pie. He said, this is terrible.
Then he thought for a moment and he said, you know, it could be worse. I could have been born a turkey.
And Speaker Ralston, this is what I've come to realize. From the day of your birth to the ride
in the hearse, things are never so bad that they couldn't be worse. Amen? So when everything
give thanks because this is the will of God. But I'll tell you, ladies and gentlemen,
I appreciate you so much. It's not only the will of God, but it's, it's the wish of God.
It's the wish of God. There were 10 men in the Bible that were healed of leprosy. It's
a terrible skin disease that the fingers and toes would literally rot off. It was terrible
disease and I want to elaborate much on the story but Jesus healed 10 men and one
man turned around and said thank you and Jesus said this he said where are the
nine where are the nine all I want to say is apparently this omnipotent
omniscient, I'm not present, God notices when we're not
thankful. Apparently, this God who didn't begin when the
beginning began, but the one who began the beginning notices
when we're not thankful. It's the wish of God. 73 times, the
Bible says, to meditate, Clint Crowe in this wonderful
delegation to give thanks. I really want to be like that
lady that got up one morning and she had three hairs on her head. And she said,
you know, I believe I'll braid my hair today. Beth, she got up the second morning
and she had two hairs on her head and she said, you know, I believe I'll
part my hair in the middle today. She got up the next morning, she had one hair
on her head and she said, you know, I believe I'll wear my hair in a ponytail
today. She got up the next morning and she had no hair on her head and she said,
thank God I don't have to do my hair today. There's always something to thank
God for, but if we're not careful folks, we'll be grumbly hateful instead of
humbly grateful. See, it's it's the will of God. It's the wish of God, but I'll tell
you something else. It's the wisdom of God. Let me give you something to think
about. Ten men were healed and one man gave thanks and Jesus said to that one
man, go thy way, thy faith had made thee whole. Now wait, ten more healed but
only one was whole. And we're only whole when we live lives of gratitude. And it's in our
best interest. It's a proven fact. Medical field tells us we'll sleep better if we're grateful.
We'll live longer if we're grateful. We'll have better relationships if we're grateful.
Albert Einstein said there's only two ways to live life. He said one way you can
live life is nothing is a miracle and the second way you can live life is
everything is a miracle. Everything is a miracle. The Bible says but thanks be
unto God which giveeth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. So
So during this season, perhaps we could just say, thank God for dirty dishes, for they
have a tale to tale, while others are going hungry, we're all doing pretty well.
With home health and happiness, we should not make a fuss by the stack of evidence
before us.
God's been very good to us.
Let's pray.
Lord, I want to thank you for this day.
I want to thank you for this delegation.
I thank you for Speaker Ralston,
and I pray God that you're blessing
and leadership and wisdom upon this special man.
I pray for every one of these men and women.
They're good people.
They sacrifice for people like me.
They sacrifice to serve this wonderful state
state that we live in. And whether it be the leaders, whether it be brother
Burns or God, all through the delegation, I just pray that you would help
every one of them that you would just give them your guidance and your wisdom
give them a wonderful, wonderful thanks given season. Would you bless them and
keep them, make your face to shine upon them, be gracious and to them, lift your
count at Sponum, may they experience your peace. And I pray this in Christ's name. Amen.
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which
it stands. One nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.
The doorkeepers will unlock the doors.

Chair recognizes Chairman Hogan, the chair of the Committee on Information and Audits.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
The Committee on Information and Audits has read the journal of a previous legislative
day and found it to be correct.
And furthermore, Mr. Speaker, with all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams, it's still
a beautiful world. Be cheerful and strive to be happy. Representative Stephen Sains.
Oh my goodness. Is there any objection? I'm sorry, Chairman Hogan, the Chair of the Committee
on information and audits, reports that the journal of the previous legislative day has
been read and found to be correct.
Is there any objection to the confirmation of the journal that Chair here is done and
the journal is confirmed?
The clerk will read the resolution establishing the order of business for the day.
Mr. Burns, only 159 moves.
Follow me.
Establishes the order of business that are first part of the period unanimous consent in
Introduction to bills and resolutions, first reading and reference of Senate bills and resolutions.
Morning orders.
Is there any objection to the adoption of the resolution establishing the order of business for the day?
The chair here is none in the resolution is adopted.
We're going on now to morning orders.
Morning orders.
I know we have several that are waiting to greet Benny Tate, and I don't want to interrupt
that, but if you just kind of keep the volume down a little bit, we're going to move forward
here a little bit. All other members will give attention and respect to the
member in the well. The chair recognizes the dean of this house, Dean Smirey, for
a morning order. Two minutes each for morning orders today.
Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House, I wanted to come this morning and you all
know that I've been under consideration and one of the gentlemen that has been so helpful
to me with the Secret Service, I got a call on a text and I mentioned it to Chairman Smith
that he had passed away and I remember when he called me and I asked the speaker if he
He would do an interview for me and this gentleman was so good to me.
I didn't know him, I just met him.
He came to see me for five times and assisted me through on charter waters, areas where I
never been.
And you're always grateful when you meet people and they're good people.
You don't even know them.
And that's just a blessing.
And I pray for Mr. Gita, Thomas Manning Gita's family.
I never met him, but I am going to, and I just wanted to, as you all do, keep his family
in your prayers, and, oh, he just said when he so much, it gave me so much wisdom, and
I just want to come, this morning, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, the house, just to say,
thank you to him, and I said, he is a rest in peace, so thank you, Mr. Speaker, for
giving me this moment to come and just said thank you. Always believe in the
fact that in life we ought to plant seeds to trees for the shade we may never
see and that's what he did. He planted a seed in me for the shade that he may
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Almost exactly half a year ago on May 21, 2021, we lost Marissa McCall Dodson.
She died unexpectedly at the age of 37 while playing basketball with her son.
She was the public policy director for the Southern Center for Human Rights.
She worked in this building with us.
The newspaper will tell you that she was instrumental in passing the first citizens
arrest repeal in the country and we're proud of that and that's true, but she was and
she is so much more than that to us.
Heartbroken does not begin to describe the effect of her passing on the community of people
who suggests this in this building.
She was a mother to AJ, a basketball coach, a daughter.
Her mother is here today, came to call Perry
with her husband, Paul.
She was a sister and a friend of many,
and I miss her dearly.
I know y'all understand this.
She had a love-hate relationship with this building.
I think we all do.
She saw its ugly side.
And she carried that ugliness for us.
and the CLOB in the halls of the capital when we were not able to,
because she believed that the work that she was doing was worth it.
You know, we often think of making an impact in here in terms of passing bills,
big old floor speeches, but I think the place where public policy is transformed
is in the heart of people like Marissa Dotson.
Because it's holding that tension of a broken and unjust world that is the real work,
and it's the work we all have to do
if we want to see progress on any public policy
as she we care about.
She went to meetings and listened to us,
acted fool and not know what we were talking about
and she sat there and she smiled,
but she gave it right back to us
and she told us when we were wrong.
We didn't deserve her.
Georgia did not deserve her.
So I'll end my comments before Representative Nguyen
speaks to her as well by just saying,
she would want me to say this up here today.
That we need to end cash bail.
We don't need to have a wealth-based system of detention.
We need to end the death penalty.
It's expensive.
It's arbitrary.
And it's applied in a racially discriminatory way.
These were her wishes that she gave her life for in this
building, because she believed in them deeply.
She touched my heart.
I hope she touched yours.
We will remember her forever.
Thank you for your time.
Chair recognizes representative Wynne for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Just a few weeks before we lost Marissa, my family took a vacation
for the first time, post-pandemic.
And I had just returned from the beach.
And my sister said she had a phone call with Marissa.
The Fountain County District Attorney
had just made a decision to seek the death penalty
in the Atlanta sponsored shooting case.
And my younger sister shared with me
that Marissa wanted to get some guidance
on how she could voice her opposition to the death penalty,
but she also wanted to respect the varied viewpoints
within the Asian-American community.
And especially when it came to those
who were directly impacted by the tragedy.
And I think of this moment often
because it captures so well this delicate ballot
and stat we hold, which is the human instinct
to rely on the criminal justice system for closure,
but also recognizing that same criminal legal system
is also used as a weapon,
especially when it comes to black and brown communities
and to poor people.
Marissa had moral clarity on this.
She never ever confused accountability for justice,
and she dedicated her life to guiding us
to that same moral clarity.
And she called upon us to have the grace, courage,
and audacity.
She reminded us that justice isn't measured by incarceration, and that true liberation
can only be achieved through eradicating poverty, dismantling systemic racism, and leading
with humanity first.
My sister told me that Marissa ended the call by asking if we could all get together for
a celebration, because the work that she did in this building and outside of this building
was so emotionally heavy.
She did have a love-hate relationship with us here, but she always knew what the assignment
was, which is she put aside herself and her feelings and she carried that burden for
a greater cause.
But she was eternally optimistic because she believed we could build a Georgia where
her little boy could play basketball and grow up and live in his own greatness.
We never had a chance to find some time to celebrate because shortly after that, Marissa was
called home.
So in honor of Marissa, let's all find a little time for celebration, even in our moments
of darkness and grief.
And as we celebrate Marissa, let's also recommit ourselves to building a better Georgia for her
son, AJ, and for all of the people that she fought for, and if we could just have a moment
of silence in honor of Marissa McAuliffe-Dotson.
Thank you, I yield the well.
Chair recognizes representative Wade
for a morning order.
Good morning colleagues, I appreciate the opportunity, it's a beautiful day, nothing like
a good Friday.
And often we have the opportunity to hear folks recognize those very worthy citizens that
have already gone on.
And I think that's an important thing.
But today I'm actually here and I believe there is nothing that doesn't happen for a purpose.
In the message we heard today, you heard a discussion of thanks in America and I want
to share with you a story of my county and the county that Speaker Ralston represents
Dawson County. There is a miracle story going on in my community that you won't probably
not see from a Hollywood movie or see on the channel two news. But there's a young man
named Rodney Castleberry. On August 6th, Rodney was admitted to the hospital with COVID.
He has a wife named Jessica, who is a paraprofessional in our schools.
He happens to be a cattle and poultry farmer, but we refer to that as he raises cows and
chickens.
They've got two beautiful daughters.
His journey has been nothing but miracle after miracle.
He fought to stay off the ventilator, and these are many of the words of his wife she
shared with me.
On August 18th, he took a term for the worst and they said we have to put him on a ventilator.
Rodney is in his mid-40s like myself.
Then they had to sedate him and he started running a high fever.
He became septic.
His chances continued to decline.
They couldn't keep his blood pressure.
Throughout the day, didn't even have an improvement because folks in Dawson County are fighters.
He wants to raise those girls.
This continued on, but then they were told we've got to get him on an ECMO machine and
they didn't have any.
You guys know that we've had trouble with supplies.
They get a last minute call before she had to make the decision no wife wants to ever
make, we have one, another miracle. While all this was going on, my community, now everyone
in here has utilized signage for your campaign, right? Well, we have rally for Rodney signs
in my community. Folks that don't know Rodney put them in their yard. There's an amount
of money that has to be raised when you get to the stage
that Mr. Castleberry is in because he now is fighting
to go through PT.
He's here in Emory, in Atlanta.
And this is why we're all connected.
The nurses that cared for him to get him to the place
where he is now in consideration of having a double lung
transplant.
But he had to raise a little over $15,000 to qualify.
She shared with me the miracle of when a stranger
reached out and said, I want to help you.
I want to sell these signs for you to raise money.
The first fundraiser that they had after they got every sign
that they printed sold that probably
should have only yielded about $5,500.
The lady called Jessica and said, we've raised $15,030.
another miracle.
I'm very proud of my community.
Speaker Ralston, I know you're proud as well.
Dawson County are people that love their neighbor.
As they're my believe, we're all called to do.
And the miracle is, and the lesson for us is to never,
ever, ever give up.
This young man has two daughters and a wife
who are going to be served, and I believe
that he will receive those two lung transplants.
His journey is not over, but I ask you, if you would,
because I believe in miracles,
all that would say, hallelujah with me,
and then I will be done.
Hallelujah.
Watching out for your Rodney, thank you, sir.
Appreciate it.
Chair recognizes representative Burt now
for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Today, Representative Davis, Johnson, Jackson, we would like to welcome the ladies of Delta
Sigma Theta Sorority Incorporated.
We are starting our 55th Annual Convention here in Atlanta at the World Congress Center,
which means that they're going to spend a lot of money and we just want to welcome them
here and hope that we have an outstanding convention. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes Chairman Hogan, the Chair of the Committee on Information and Audits
for a Morning Order.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the House. I'm announcing today that
And our PGA tournament, our SM started just today on St.
Simon's at C. Island golf courses.
And we have 11 bullet oaks competing in that tournament.
So go bullet oaks.
to recognize his representative Seba for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good morning, colleagues.
It's my first time in the well.
I'm Devin Sebaugh, the proud new representative from District 34, and today I bring greetings
from Cobb County, Georgia.
As many of you know, I was sworn into office in July of this year to take the seat of buzz
the Georgia Tech mascot and his alter ego, but it reaves for whom I have great aberration
and respect.
With that being said, I think it is important for the record the following be noted.
Since my swearing in, Kenosal Mountain High School in District 34, under the leadership
of a principal, Nathan Stark, Athletic Director, Philip Matthews, and Coach Caleb Carmine,
made it to the region tournament in football, and they won the region, and they've advanced
to the second round of the state football championship.
And for the first time in school history, they've made history in that school.
It's been 20 years, and Coach Carmine played on the first football team at Kennesall Mountain
high school, so I want to congratulate Principal Stark,
AD Matthews, Coach Carmine, and the entire Mustang Nation
on their success this season.
Also since my swearing in, our Atlanta Braves
that now call Cobb County Home has won the National League
Championship and been crowned the MLB World Series Champions.
Also since my swearing in to replace Buzz
in this general assembly, sports
Illustrated has recognized UGA 10 as the number one mascot in all of NCAA football.
And finally, since my swearing in, our beloved Bulldog football program, hailing from the
great University of Georgia and Athens, are undefeated at 10 and 0.
Mr. Speaker, it could all be just a coincidence.
And I yield the will.
Well, I don't know.
Your predecessor now is employed by a school who's football team is what, three and eight.
One winner, one not so much.
recognizes Chairman Chokas for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good morning, everyone.
Today is a great day, and this weekend is a great weekend.
I have two daughters and a son, and after this weekend, I will have two daughters and
two sons.
My oldest daughter is getting married this weekend, and I will be an instant grandfather.
My future son-in-law has two daughters, Savannah and Tegan.
And so they will be welcome members of our family.
So I'm really excited.
I just wanted to share that with you.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Clark will read the caption to a group of privilege resolutions.
Honoring the Life and Memory of Sam Thomas, Honoring the Life and Memory of Uteen,
Eloise Schuman, Recognizing and Commending Kimberly Ballard, Washington, commemorating
the 25th anniversary of the National Museum of the Mighty Eighth Air Force, Commending
and congratulating Darryl Peter on her A, acknowledging Mrs. Matthews who coax him for her work
in public education, recognizing commending Mrs. Karen P. Jones, recognizing November 30th,
2021 as Monroe by Centennial Celebration Day, commending all Vietnam error and Vietnam
more veterans and their families,
recognizing commanding Timothy C.
Resard and for other purposes
I can please the reading of the privilege resolutions.
Is there any objection to adopting
the privilege resolutions that Chair here's done
and the resolutions are adopted?
Chair recognizes the majority leader of the House
for to speak to a resolution.
Mr. Clerk, would you read the resolution?
Senate resolution number 48EX by Senator Dugan of the 30th,
a resolution relative to meetings and
adjournments of the General Assembly.
Chair recognizes the majority leader to speak to the resolution.
Thank you, Ms. Speaker.
As Representative Bentley would say, happy Friday, yes.
We passed a scheduling resolution earlier, and we need to make some adjustments here, so
I'll go into what those are, Mr. Clerk,
could you put the resolution on the board?
Maybe not, I'll explain it then.
It's on your desk.
Under this resolution, on Saturday, tomorrow,
November 20th, the speaker will gable this house
in the session for a special session day 14.
We will be convening for procedural purposes.
Roe call will be dispensed with, and members are neither required or expected to attend tomorrow.
This simply follows the President set by this House that's been in place for any number
of years as we tend to the business of this House.
On Sunday, November 21st, this House will be in adjournment.
November the 22nd. Monday we will have special session day 15. And on Monday I
am hopeful this house will be able to complete some ported business we've been
about for the last few days. Of course if we are unable to complete that
business on Monday we will return the following day. I believe that
thoroughly explains about what our posture is and what our process here is in
in the House as we tend to the important business
for the people of this state.
Ms. Speaker, I'll be very glad to answer any questions
if there are any.
If not, I would ask for this body's favorable consideration
of SR-48EX.
We could adopt it.
You don't appear to have any questions.
Thank you, Ms. Speaker.
Are you the well?
The procedure tomorrow, the reason we neither expect
require people to be here will be much the same as we did on day 29 of the 2020
session after the pandemic suspension when we convened to do first readers of
bills coming over from the Senate and then we also did that in 2018 with the
Hurricane Michael special session and on a Saturday so that members could get
out and attend the funeral former rules chair Meadows, so there is precedent for what we're
going to do.
I will be here.
You don't have to be tomorrow.
So I think that's about as clear as I can put it, hope you have a good weekend.
I'm hopeful that we will finish Monday.
But that requires some fair dealing on both sides of this building.
We have some announcements.
Is there any objection to the adoption of Senate Resolution 48EX?
Hearing no objection, that resolution is adopted.
recognizes the Minority Caucus Chair,
Representative Mitchell for an announcement.
Thank you for your patience, Mr. Speaker.
The Democratic Caucus will have a very quick meeting at 11.15 in room 216 here in the Capitol.
Thank you so very much.
Chair recognizes Chairman Cooper for an announcement.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Ladies and gentlemen of the House, outside the chamber, both chambers, some upstairs
outside the balcony.
I have left packets of cards about the pharmacy that I talked to you about yesterday.
The one that we passed the bill in 2016 to create, they take good, in-date, excess medicines
from drug companies and other places, and then people in our state who are low income
or having trouble paying for their medicines can access those medicines and they will be
to them. They have been very successful, but they can do a lot more, and we have a lot
of people in this state that can use help with paying for their medications. The cards tell
you how to do it. When I let the chamber yesterday and went up to my office, I'd already had
a call from the Cobb County School Board and somebody listening to our proceedings and
said that she had sent out the information to all the social workers in the Cobb County
school district. Miriam told me in my seat one of my close seat mates that she's
gonna give it out tomorrow when she gives out turkeys to the needy. Someone else
has a diabetes walk. Please pick up a packet if you haven't already done it
they're outside the chamber in a box and get the word out about this wonderful
resource we have that you helped create. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes
Chairman Darlene Taylor for an announcement.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
The legislative and congressional reapportionment committee will meet tomorrow Saturday, November
20th.
This is a virtual or in-person meeting and it will meet at 9 a.m. to 11.
That's the congressional and legislative reapportionment tomorrow at 9.
And it's going to be in room 406.
Thank you.
completes our announcements. This house will be in recess till 6 p.m. this evening. You can
leave immediately when we leave here. We're staying open for the chair to come back in and
first read any bill that is passed out of the Senate by the Senate today. So that's the only
reason for keeping it open. House will be in recess to 6 p.m.
