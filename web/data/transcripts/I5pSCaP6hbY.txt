TRANSCRIPT
----------
A Georgia Senate bill would recognize
gold and silver as legal tender and
create a state approved bullion
depository. You would be allowed to make
payments through a system much like a
debit card. Joining me is the sponsor of
the bill, Republican Senator Marty
Harbin of Tyrone. He is chair of the
insurance and labor committee committee
and vice chair of retirement. And his
other committees include finance and
ethics. Also here is one of the bill's
many co-sponsors, Democratic Senator
Sonia Halpurn. She is Senate Minority
Caucus Vice Chair. She is vice chairman
of the Urban Affairs Committee in the
Senate and her other committees include
finance, appropriations, education, and
youth. Welcome to lawmakers for this
year. Good to have you both here. Now,
let's talk about this. What problem does
the bill solve?
Why should we should the average person
care about gold right now?
>> Well, gold is a commodity that has been
around for six 6,000 years.
>> Yeah.
>> If you look at it, where we we look at
the power of what we're doing is through
the US Constitution. Our founding
fathers had a lot of wisdom back in
those days. And article one section 10
says that states cannot create currency
but they can have gold and silver
depositories that are regulated by the
state. Therefore, if you want to put
gold and and back in the 1800s that was
done, you would have money that was
placed there under state supervision and
you and I I could write a check to you
for a gold check. You could go to the
bank and get your gold. And gold has
been recognized for years. It's also
been a hedge against inflation and it's
a it's it's a commodity if you will and
uh here you know another part is that
for banks it's a tier one asset for
banks. Banks buy gold for a reason and
that is it is a stabilizing force if you
will in their portfolio. Now it goes up
and down just like any other commodity
but the average person does not have the
ability to
transact business that way. Okay,
>> here's here's a here's a coin.
>> That's a gold coin, huh?
>> That's a gold coin. That coin's per
worth right at5,000 $5,000 today. The
average person can't come up with $5,000
in that respect. And so what we're
looking at is you can buy this via a
fintech technology. You can buy $100 or
$50, hold it in your gold account, and
then through a fintech transaction,
which would be a like a debit card,
which is here. This technology is
available today. I can swipe my card,
buy my Chick-fil-A or my Coca-Cola, and
then it fractionally
takes my money from my gold coin.
>> And when you look at that, this is gives
the how do I say any investor the
ability to invest in something that he
couldn't get to before. And really, it's
just another way to pay. We have someone
asked me, he says, "Well, how about um
Bitcoin?" I said, 'But Bitcoin is not
constitutional. And that was the issue
that I I look at is is it
constitutional? We have five states that
have already passed legislation. Texas
has its own depository. They were the
first to have a depository where gold
could be stored. Florida, Arkansas, and
Louis uh Louisiana, those states have
already passed legislation to do that.
So, they see that. And like I said, it's
another way to pay, but it's a way for
you to have something that's a hard
currency just like this. Someone once
said, land by land because they're not
making any more of it. And gold has held
its value again up and down. But
inflationary, as we've seen inflation
occur, and a lot of that is because
this, they can tax you, tax me, print
money they don't have that makes your
money and my my money worth less. But
gold has been a great hedge for
inflation. And what this does for the
citizens of Georgia is it gives every
person the opportunity to invest in
something they could not otherwise
invest. The bill number is SB424.
I'll say this, it's for Georgia and it's
24 karat.
>> I see. I had a feeling there was
something to that. I love that. I love
when the when the bill numbers have
something cool. You you have signed on
to this. I have. Tell tell us why.
>> Well, you know, I just like so many of
my colleagues uh continue to hear from
families about affordability and uh
inflation is pressure against their
money. There are so many Georgians that
are doing the right thing, saving money.
Think about a family that is saving $50
a month. Well, that money, you know,
with the cost of groceries going up and
gas going up and rent going up, that
savings actually is not growing at the
same pace. But the ability to
fractionally buy gold, which has held
its ve its value steady over the years,
is really an interesting way for people
to be able to protect their money that
they've worked so hard to earn and save
and still have the ability to spend it
if they need to.
>> Yeah. and it doesn't fall apart like
money does like tear or anything.
>> And don't get me started on pennies not
being around anymore. So let's talk a
little bit about what the depository
would be about and how that would work.
>> What we have looked at is we don't
believe that Georgia needs to spend the
money to build a depository per se. And
what we would do is there would uh under
the bill we would have a committee led
by the treasurer of the state of
Georgia, an appointment by the governor,
one two members by the house and two
members by the senate. And they would be
the regulatory authority that would
overlook the the depositories. The
depository could be Brinks. Brinkx is
one of the ones we've talked to. They
could do that instantly. So we don't
have to spend any capital for the
depository. And then the state would be
responsible to do the audits to make
sure that they're handling that money.
But your money would be your money.
Unlike a a bank today, your money is on
deposit and you are a creditor. This is
your money that if you wanted to do it,
you could go to the depository, take
that money out because it's yours and
you would pay a fee for storage and
therefore it's not going to cost anybody
anything except the initial startup cost
we see from that standpoint.
>> Yeah. So that's what I was going to ask
you. Is there a fiscal note on this?
>> Yes, we've ordered one for it. What we
think will happen, you'll need maybe one
person to help get it started up that
would work for the treasury or for the
treasur. And basically, they would do
the RFP uh for the storage and the RFPs
for the fintech technology to do the
transactional goal from that standpoint.
And it's up and running right now. Um,
one of the companies that's up and
running and does a really good job thus
far has been uh um Glint and they are in
England and that's where my money
currently I have gold there and I can go
in and swipe my card and buy Chick-fil-A
with gold. What a what a novel idea.
>> So it it wouldn't be a different card or
or anything. No special card similar to
what we're used to using.
>> Yeah, it's I mean this is an actual card
right here,
>> right? and I could take that and buy
what I want to buy and then fractionally
they take it off of my gold account
>> and they charge that. I believe that
that's something that can be negotiated
where the fee should actually be less
for this possibly because it's backed by
gold. It's not a credit card. It's
backed automatic. So I think that's a we
we would do this. We we'll do an RFP
from the state to say who who what are
the prices and we could have multiple
storage facilities but what we want is
you want to be constitutional. We need
that to be regulated by our treasur and
the and the board there and then have
vendors that we could do to do do our
transactions with from that standpoint.
>> Okay.
>> It's just another way to pay.
>> I I see that. So So some places have
said this is kind of symbol symbolic.
What do you say?
>> I say it's not symbolic at all. I mean
at the end of the day people are feeling
the pressure. Their money is not going
as far. And really think of this as like
the piggy bank for the modern economy.
Um and gold holds its value. So over
time, gold has steadily held its value.
If I were to have saved $400 in um the
20s and could buy a suit, a belt, a
shirt, boots, and a hat. Well, that same
$400 today can't do that. But if I had
that same $400 in the whatever the
ounces of gold would have been at that
time, I could still in fact buy all
those things today because the gold
holds its value. And even though it can
fluctuate, it holds its value over time
against inflation.
>> Yeah. So we talked, let's talk about the
fluctuation the other day. It made the
news because it dropped dramatically.
>> Yes. I said this, if you bought it last
week, you're sad. If you bought it last
year, you're happy because it has
maintained its value. I mean, if you go
back a year ago, it was in the 28 $2,800
an ounce. Uh, it closed today in the
4,900s. So, I mean, it's it's still been
there. And if you look at it, it's uh
it's still a stable value that you hold
that has a value that's uh not like a a
company can go bankrupt, a stock can go
bankrupt. It's something that's there.
And it's like I said, 6,000 years of
history is backing up that people desire
gold and it's a value.
>> So, do you expect like a a gold rush?
Like people are just like gonna grab
goamn like you know.
>> How about this? There there's gold on
the gold dome. There's 80 oh 80 plus
ounces there. So I say if the dome
should be covered with gold, the people
of Georgia should have their own gold.
>> Okay. That's the slogan going there. You
agree with that? That's the slogan going
forward for all of this. So yeah, you
guys you get you got a lot of interest
here.
>> We want to make Georgia gold. We believe
that it's a good thing and that's that's
what's happening. It gives and it's like
this this is not this is not for rich or
poor. It opens the door to people that
couldn't get in otherwise. And I think
it's just good economic sense to be able
to have diversification.
