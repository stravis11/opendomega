TRANSCRIPT
----------
the joint study committee on dual enrollment for highly skilled talent at younger ages based off
as Senate resolution 175. Got my chairman Matt Dubnik here. And we've got multiple members on
line. We got Dr. Art recesso here with this line line and Derek DeBrowie at it. Thank you.
So glad everyone's here. We are going to get a little out of order on the agenda and keep in mind
we've only got 30 minutes in this room. So we're actually going to do public comment first and then
we're going to go over the report. When we go over the report for committee members, if you'll
just go straight to page 18, that's where our findings are. And so we will go through those
findings. If you have any additions or subtractions, we'll do that and actually Chairman Dupnick,
do you want to kind of cover that process and what that'll look like?
Like Mr. Chairman, so members of the committee will treat this like we are in session,
And so we will, I will walk through this with Chairman Brass, we will review this and at the appropriate time, I will entertain a motion.
And should that motion be that this do pass, then we, at that time, we would discuss any changes as he said anything that needs to come out amendments, etc.
So just procedurally for what it's worth, that's how we'll tackle this today.
and we'll kind of walk air by through that as we get to it.
So first, let's kick off with our public comments.
Did we have anybody sign up Mercedes?
All right, is there anybody online, public, from the public?
Okay, good, we'll jump right into the report.
All right, again, let's go to page 18 on your report.
And we'll give you all the cliff note version because that's how I got through college essentially what we've come up with in this report and what we've learned through this process through these four study committees that we've done.
And there's really three things that we feel like we need to tackle.
And they are, simplify, educate, and invest.
And so when you dig into the simplify, we'll start there.
And y'all can all read, so I'm not going to read, but I'll just kind of hit the highlights.
We kind of determined that there's really no clear definition
in statute for high demand career.
It is mentioned in statute on multiple occasions,
but again, we never actually define it anywhere.
So that is one of the first recommendations
is that we need to clearly define high demand career.
We need to add that in the statute.
And I'll add to one thing that's not in this report
but that was discussed was when we're talking about
simplifying and we're talking about, you know,
high demand careers and defining it,
we did determine that there's two lists out there.
And we think in order to simplify,
it would be good to go down to one list.
And so I think, in my humble opinion,
that would be a good little sub bullet point
under a clearly defined Honda Bay and career.
Next, we've got the next bullet point
you got ensure information regarding dual enrollment,
CTAE courses and accelerated career pathways
is more accessible to parents and students.
Again, I think that one's pretty self-explanatory
if anyone from the committee wants to touch on that more
or add more to it.
certainly make those, we can take those suggestions now, or when we get to the appropriate time for the amendment, you can certainly do it there.
So is there anybody wants to comment on that?
All right, next we need to streamline and encourage more articulation agreements between our local school systems, the technical college system of Georgia and the university system of Georgia.
This would create strategically designed two plus two arrangements in high demand career fields.
Again, we discussed this really in our last study committee.
You know, we found that a lot of these arrangements were done more locally.
they're doing and regionally and I think it would be in the best interest of our of our students
and our future workforce if if there was a little more uniformity across our state and
is there anybody else wants to comment on that saying none we'll move on and last but point
The artificial remnants on the program by removing the sunset provision in Senate Bill 86.
Quick refresher, of course, we did have a three year sunset on Senate Bill 86.
And as a student, as a parent, as a counselor, it is difficult to recommend this path if there's no clarity that this path is going to be available in three years.
think that one's pretty self-explanatory.
All right, Mr. Chairman, you want to cover educate?
Absolutely.
So I think, again, I'm a chairman brass.
We don't need to read every word here.
And I do want to just kind of echo his last point.
I think when it comes to a time frame, we want continuity
and we want this to exist.
I will actually pull a line from above.
when we talk about educating,
I think this is about promotion,
both to parents and students.
No parents and students,
some are gonna, I believe, see action
by getting to the parents, some better to the students,
but they're both gonna talk at home,
but I also think, and it talks about,
down in here, high school counselors,
but I love what we put in here, middle school counselors.
We heard it when we went, you can't just start
when they're 18 or 16 or, you know,
we have to go back earlier and earlier.
And so I really think the crux of the message here
about educating is to get the word out.
I'm a marketer by trade,
so I'm a little partial to talking about education
and I really think that that's marketing.
But if we come down here to the bottom
and look at these bullet points,
I don't think it can be stressed enough
that there has to be a way centered around data
for us to define high demand careers.
It's one thing of Chairman Brass and I get together
at right, and are shooting marbles
and trying to figure out which way the wind's blowing today,
but this needs to be based on data
that can be quantified, that we contract
and we can monitor, and it's not at the whim's
right of any elected official or board
with no disrespect to any of those people,
but I think that needs to stand on its own.
We already talked about getting the word out
and I think really these other bullet points
kind of illustrate what I was talking about.
I am a data junkie,
so the more that we have good data,
we can make good decisions,
but as the old saying goes, garbage in, garbage out.
So I think it's gonna be incumbent
and I know I stress this before
I'll stress it again and be on my soapbox and I'll shut up after this.
This is going to take everybody.
This is going to take anything from the governor's office and all the entities that fall under
his purview to the legislature and what we can do to TCSG, to USG, to student finance,
the independence.
If we're all not at the table working to make this better, we're just going to be back
here in a few more years with a few more gray hairs having another study committee talking
about the same thing, back in Mr. Amin.
Anybody want to comment or discuss that online? Okay.
All right. And so our third and final little section here on page 19 is invest.
And so part of that was we discussed more funding for technical college system of Georgia instructors.
We discussed provide more funding for high school counselor positions.
We discussed conducting and we've got on here an annual return.
I would like to see that change to an ongoing return.
A lot of times when you're conducting investment analysis,
you really may not get a good analysis over one year.
So I don't know that we need to lock ourselves
into an annual return.
So we could just kind of change that at the appropriate time
to ongoing return on investment analysis
to ensure that existing CTAE programs of study
are aligned with workforce needs,
informed by labor market demand,
link to occupations that are middle school, middle to high wage and vertically aligned to post
secondary programs, and to determine where high demand high school high wage CTAE programs are
offered across all recognized local education agencies. And then third, understand student access,
participation in completion data by student groups to determine potential inequities.
And again, I think that kind of sum all that up and basically the legislature needs to determine who needs to evaluate our list and then come up with a way to either add or remove programs as needed.
So that is not in there, but we might put that in there for a point of clarity.
All right.
Is there any discussion?
Did we, does he might feel like we missed anything or would like to see something added?
I think now would be a good time to discuss that.
And then we can discuss further as we get into the, the motion for the actual report.
Anybody online?
Yeah, just a quick question. I don't know if there was a DOE rep that was there they could
talk about if they've looked at the recommendations anything they can do
before legislative action something that just would be more policy from DOE instead of
in the regulations state law.
I would need more clarification from the question.
I guess if you've had time, I'm not sure if you have had enough time to look at the similar recommendations.
Are there areas where DOE could would consider enacting some of these recommendations.
You know that wouldn't require state action official legal action. It'd be more DOE policy
So we have a look at the recommendations
I'm
Again, not sure exactly where
DOE would be able to make adjustments on the on our end
But I mean again, I'd have to I think that would have to be a deeper discussion around what specifically
folks would be looking for for DOE to make me just, for all of the recommendations that
are provided.
We took about defining high demand careers.
That doesn't happen on our end.
I mean, we are, like I said, providing information and, you know, use this to systems on like
you accelerated career diplomas as a matter of fact our state board already adjusted our board rules
to change the name from option B to accelerated career diploma and that happened this past year.
So we had already begun taking steps there. The educating the systems and counselors on the
importance of dual enrollment and the accelerated career pathways. We've already gone down that
Lastly, we have a dual enrollment coordinator that, again, works with our school counselors
and provides them some of this information.
You know, similarly, we will, you know, continue to make adjustments and share this information
with middle school counselors as well.
We, you know, I've already been doing that, but we will, you know, improve our efforts in that area.
Outside of that, I think that, you know, the other areas here, most of it, like, you know, providing more funding, I mean, we don't have, we don't have the capacity to do that.
So, like I said, I've looked at it and finally came out yesterday, but I think, you know, just offhand, I share some of the efforts that we've done.
obviously we will continue to look at the the study committee report you know now that it's
out and once it's finalized as you know we do with all of them and on iron we'll redo what we can.
Now I think you've done a good job in the past I'm trying to get the information out sometimes
if you get it out it's not always hurt or accepted broadly I didn't know if there were other ways
of getting the message out or making sure, you know, like start from the top, like superintendents
or boards. If you guys are active with GSSA or George School Board Association to try to get
help to get their support to get it through the ranks of all the schools, I'm going to make sure
everybody buys into it. Absolutely, and we just should information with, with, uh,
and coordinate with all of our various education partners with this G.S.S.A. or G.S.B.A.
So we certainly, like I said, share that information through both their conferences
and through their various mediums including our recess. So, you know, we will continue to do that
as well. Absolutely. Great. Thank you. Well, and I'll add two
represent towns and this this report doesn't lock the legislature into really anything. We're only
making recommendations and we're not even necessarily recommending the legislature specifically,
although I did say it in the last comment I made, but we aren't necessarily locking the legislature
into anything. We're just saying we're recommending these changes take place. We're not necessarily
we're recommending how they take place.
You know, a lot of times, as you know, we just, sometimes it's just getting, getting all
the players of the three-legged stool together and working out a solution.
And you know, we've got representatives from each on this, on this committee.
And I'm confident that, that we're all going to be able to sit down and figure something
out, moving forward.
Whether it be legislatively or not through rules and regs, there's multiple ways to skin
a cat, if you will, and we're going to keep the idea here is to build a, build on a West
Hardier, great program and keep it sustainable and whether that's, whether we need to do that
legislatively or not, you know, we can, we'll figure that out.
So, but great question.
Thank you.
Great question.
Any other questions from anyone online
or all two of you here with us?
You're a gold star for being here.
Yeah, that's right.
Okay.
All right, well, I guess if there's nothing else
to add at this time, we can certainly discuss things.
Should we have a motion to move this report out of this committee?
And again, there would be time after that motion to discuss any changes or additions.
So seeing no other discussion, I see representative towns and you've already hit the hot mic button.
So I'll recognize you.
No, I'd like to make that motion for the committee to go with the recommendations.
All right, so we have a motion that this how do we officially say it the findings and recommend recommendations do pass is there a second?
Second.
All right, we have a motion in a second. So now would be the time for any further discussion.
Miss Taylor.
Okay, got it.
So if we have any amendments or changes that are needed,
Chairman Brass, do you have some already?
Well, I'm a chairman.
I mean, as a chairman, I can't make an amendment,
but since we're discussing it,
I'd love to add a little language if someone will do it for me.
But up under that first bullet point,
or really wherever is appropriate,
I would like some clarifying language
to where we're gonna recommend
that we take the high demand career list
from two lists down to one.
So, if anybody wants another brownie point.
What would you specifically say that language would be
and where would we insert it just to be clear?
I think after bullet point one,
So I inserted a second bullet under the first set of recommendations and it says create
a singular high demand career list that is regularly maintained to reflect workforce
needs. That's captures exactly what I was thinking. So would anyone like to make a motion
to amend with the, well, again, we won't call it the brass amendment, but we have some
language to insert. Anyone like to move that that be adopted?
This is Scott Steiner. I'd make that motion to adopt that language.
Thank you, Scott. Do we have a second?
Don't I'll speak at once now. Second.
Any further discussion on amendment number one?
All right, you give to that, Mr. Chairman. Yes, sir. All right. Well, then we won't take a vote. I also say then we'll call that for a vote.
All those in favor of men number one, please say aye. Aye. Aye. Aye.
Okay, I'll do any opposed. Same side. All right. Motion carries amendment one is adopted.
Mr. Chairman, you have some other items. Well, actually, I've got a question for Bayley. So that
last little tidbit, I said, well, you know, we need to kind of determine who should evaluate list
and update it. Is that kind of captured in that final bullet point under three?
Three three you mean? Three three yes correct. On page 19 the very last bullet point.
Would you say that's captured there or would we need some? Would this be more clarifying language?
I feel like it's captured, but if you want clarity, we can add something. I also,
based on what you said earlier, I changed it from conduct and
conduct an annual return on investment analysis to conduct an ongoing return.
Okay, I'll be fine with that.
That ledge counts back here too.
Well, I mean, it's a report just in case you wanted it.
Thank you.
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
No, that's fine. I don't even know that we need a motion on that.
Okay.
Senator parent, did you have a comment or question? I see you're unmuted.
Oh, no, I did not. I just unmuted to vote. Yeah, sorry about that.
No, I'm good job, Mr. Chairman and Mr. Chairman.
Excellent. And you wanted to make sure that you were heard today and that we got all your input at it.
Thank you so much. I just want to say I'm shocked that you don't have. I know, right? That's
I figured that's exactly what I'm feeling great to have a speaking engagement, you know,
that I'm holding on to. I appreciate you. All right. Anything else?
Does anyone else online have anything else they would like to add before we proceed forward?
All right, anyone in the room? Hearing none, we have a motion and a second that the findings
and recommendations do pass as amended once. Is there any further discussion? Hearing none.
All in favor of this passing as amended say aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Any opposed same sign?
Let's chairman that motion do pass does carry.
All right.
Well, good deal.
Well, good work everyone.
It's been a pleasure working with each and every one of you.
Appreciate your attention and and good hard work on this.
It's we appreciate all the speakers that have come forward everyone through public comment or whether they were only agenda.
We certainly appreciate it. Thank you to Albany for opening up your doors for us.
Just doing great work down there. Scott, you guys, you guys are doing a great job.
Thank you to noon in CEC mark. Thank you for opening your doors to us.
And then, of course, the people's health.
And just been, again, been a pleasure.
Bayroom, thank you for all your hard work on this.
This is a great report.
And, you know, I think it's very easy to read
for people like me, so that's good.
And again, all our staff, thank you so much
for all your hard work, Mr. Chairman.
Been an honor and a pleasure working with you, as always.
And again, we'll look forward to seeing each and every one
of you look forward to working with you
on moving this plan forward and these recommendations
and seeing them through.
And just looking forward to provide an opportunity
for these kids to walk into the workforce prepared
and ready and making good money.
So with that, we'll call this meeting adjourn.
And see my hand raised.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I did not where you got Madam later.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I just wanted to give a thanks
for a late arriving presentation from the cab county.
They really appreciate the ability to come
and present before the committee.
And we have so many talented young people in the cab
across the state so they really did appreciate the opportunity to present their
school as well. So thank you very much.
Absolutely well said thank you for that. Okay, everyone have a great day.
