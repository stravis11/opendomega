----------
Good afternoon, or maybe it's still good morning. We're pretty close. Thank you so
much for coming today to our very own Lieutenant Governor Berk Jones
Consituent Services Day for both the Cabin Foam County. The Lieutenant
Governor's position here in Georgia is so important and no one has let the
charge to be in with constituents to help them from their jobs to their
home life and their families more than Berk Jones. We're so thrilled that he has
made this a top priority for his office and we're here today with all these
wonderful resources to help all those live in this community. So without further
ado I'd like to introduce you to the Lieutenant Governor for the State of
Georgia, Fertzhugs.
Good morning! I appreciate everyone being here today. This is an exciting day and I'm
I'm also very appreciative of all the senators and house members that we have here today.
We started something when I first got elected, Lieutenant Governor, I thought I always said
I wanted our office to have a Chick-fil-A mentality, you know, with the constituent services
and we wanted to be, because that's what we are.
We're elected by the people and we're supposed to be servants for the people.
So we started a constituent service program where we've got some great individuals, T.J.
Hudson, who is here as well as Ben Garcia and I don't know if Luke's here or not, but we've
got three out there that are covering the state and the governor's state and letting
local officials know that they're coming to town to address issues, you know, every
day constituent issues that a lot of people have.
So we're very proud of that.
You know, also when you're out on the campaign trail, you always make the one thing that's
always a constant when you hear a politician is education.
You know, education is going to be at the forefront of whatever that individual is running
for.
But a lot of times an education should be at the forefront because it's the largest portion
of our budget.
It represents almost 60% of our budget, about 32 billion dollars a budget.
I'm from, that's a lot of money, I don't know about children, but you know we said education
was going to be a priority, children were going to be a priority to us and helping parents
and guardians and educators have the best tools to be successful and I am proud to have
the Georgia Leadership Council and this is our inaugural event here where we're doing
a book drive for those individuals who aren't, you know, as fortunate as some others.
We want to give them opportunities because I think reading comprehension is, I think that's
the key to success with anything, quite frankly.
If a child growing up, if they know how to read, write, and do arithmetic, they're way ahead
of the game, you know.
And I will tell you that I've always hear that, you know, that third grade, you know,
majority of your kids can't read to the third grade level, you know, by the time they
reach that.
I want that to change, you know, I want that to change, and I'm proud to have Scott Johnson
here with the council, proud to have Dr. Woods here, and I can't, you know, I still call
represented, right? But I know you have had a lot of good roles and done a lot of good things,
Dr. Wood. I appreciate you being here and you know because all this takes partnerships and you've
got to have partnerships with house members, senate members and as well as people who are over
divisions as forward as Dr. Wood and Riley and also Johnson. So we're excited that we have
have been successful. Our goal was to have a thousand books, and we've got a little over
2,000 books. So give yourself a round of applause.
You know, and he's not here today, but I tell you if you got this on the, on the, the,
the really got, brought it home to me. It's been a good friend, Malcolm Mitchell,
Here from Valdosta, Georgia. He he's he's better known for his football play days at University of Georgia
Always telling me you'd be very glad you didn't play same time. I did mouth. I
Would just been one more person you may look back
but
Malcom is something he's obviously played universe Georgia went and went on to the NFL and played for the New England Patriots had a very good career there
And what was so impressive about Malcolm is his story, you know, quite frankly.
Obviously, athletics was a reason why his abilities and athletics and him as an individual
was a reason why he got to the University of Georgia, but it took some real maturity and
foresight on his part to realize that while he was there, even though he, he and I'm not
he didn't say himself, he said, you know, I couldn't read well, you know, I was not good
in school, but he made it his mission to turn that around and then once he was done
in the NFL, he wanted to make it his mission again to reach out and contact people in
similar situations because he understands the value and he's doing great things with
his foundation and every time I try to get a chance to highlight his efforts and everything
I try to do that so you know he's out of town right now I would be remiss if I didn't
bring him up here so we're you know this is nothing more than to show our appreciation
to folks up here and here in the crowd and like I said if you want I think if you have
you want to be serious about education you got to be doing things to show that
you're serious about education and and that's all forms that's that's public that's
private and and at the university level that's you're from your technical
colleges to your university systems we want we want to be a partner with the
education outlets and and we're proud to do that so thank you all very much for
being here and really appreciate this and and we will the goal next year will be
Thank you all very much, we appreciate it.
