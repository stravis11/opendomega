House Bill 54 as passed in the House, it allowed PAs to sign home health services. And this, the Senate included allowing APRNs, which I totally support. A few reasons one, during COVID, it was allowed for three years by executive order. And it really expanded health care, health speed up the home health services, helping those who needed it, and also where the last state to allow it. So I fully support it, it's going to really help rule Georgia and just help health care in general. We're glad to take any questions. There are no questions. Thank you, and I ask for your favorable consideration of House Bill 54. Thank you. Is there any objection to the adoption of the House amendment? Chair, here's none.

The fish go to George Antony really and the juvenile code and general business relative to child custody. Chair recognizes Representative Clark to explain the Senate substitute and the House amendment. Thank you, Madam Speaker. House bill 23, as we passed, unanimously had to stop in the sitting kids out of state to these reunification camps and the House amendment. Gentlemen will suspend. Please proceed. I've attached the language from House Bill 350. It made it two rules. Didn't have enough time to get out on crossover. Has a special place in my heart. Back end, if it was 2018, it helps rescue new born babies. So, women are so being set drafted or going through, they fight the lives on danger and then need to get the baby to safety and it expanded to fire stations, police stations, hospitals and all that. Well, what this allows is a baby box to where they can place the baby in it. And then the alone will go off and the newborn baby is placed in the box and then the baby is transported to a medical facility. And after the baby checks out, de-fat comes within six hours and takes hold of the baby. Also, the primary alarm has to be checked once a month. Twice a day, the box has to be physically checked to make sure the baby is not in the box. On top of it, they're already having the alarm and all that. And I'll say, you might have seen it was in front page in the news and Tennessee. They allow the same thing and they'd rescue the baby. But an amazing program and they would allow the same thing here. So, seven baby just being left, say, on the ground, you know, at a police station and the mom goes, so it just allows the box, the technology is there, multiple states allow it. And we'd love to have your support. I'll take any questions on this. You have a question. Chair recognizes representative Cannon for a question. Thank you, Madam Speaker. Do you? Are you? One of first, thank you for the subject. It's something very near and dear to my heart as well as a labor doula. But I do have some questions for you after discussing with some national organizations about the different ways to do this same type of program. My first question is online 66. It says provided that the newborn child is no more than 30 days old. Has you considered making that up to 60 days old, which is typical around the country? I know. I remember carrying the bill from home back when I carried the bill while we had the 30 days. A lot of times past 30 days has to do with law and kind of child abandonment or something like that. And I remember it last. When I came into my team, we had that 30 days because this is that time where usually if a woman is in fear for a life, sex trafficking, you know, she has the baby and she needs to get the baby to safety. And there's something from what I remember is why we have that 30 days. But I mean, I'm open if you wanted to carry something down the road and change it to 60 days. But I mean, I think 30 days is enough time to where the mother has a child and she can drop it off at one of these locations. But thank you for your question. Thank you, G. Further Hill? How are you feeling for one more? Okay. And so the way that this is written, there's an opportunity for someone to surrender a newborn at multiple locations, not just at a fire station, but there's other locations. Someone consider it to be best practice that those surrenders happened at a hospital, specifically at an ER, which is what most of the national or no, no, the states do. And so there's no need for the ambulance service. So my question is, why are we including multiple different agencies creating multiple places of possible liability instead of just key. Keeping it with that hospital, whereas here it says medical facility, what's a medical facility versus a hospital. I'll say, I mean, I passed and again, I think I'll pull up my bill, but it expanded to the locations that's being allowed. And we've had the data, I mean, I've not seen anything negative come from these different places of letting the baby be dropped off there, more places and these places have to be a 24-7 facility. So and since the bill that I passed years ago, it's helped rescue babies and all that. So I feel very comfortable with the language in there and that it's going to protect babies and keep them safe. Thank you. Chair recognizes Chairman Cooper for a question. Thank you, Madam Chair. Will the gentleman heal? Yes, ma'am. Okay, isn't it true that sometimes usually at hospitals and at the fire station all the person when they're leaving the child actually comes in contact with either the fireman or the nurse or someone. And many of these mothers do not want to be identified. And so what the boxes do is give them a chance to put the baby in a safe place instead of leaving them in the woods to the elements. Give them a chance to live and to be safe. But the mother doesn't have to identify themselves. Is that not true? It is definitely true. Thank you. Chair recognizes leader of frustration for a question. Madam Speaker, please. The gentleman healed. So is it not true that this legislation which allows for the protection of babies for them to be put into care in a controlled environment as legislation was worked on by representative Cameron. Very hard was considered here in this house. And it's just simply part of your bill here at this late stage of session. Exactly. Right in line with my bill and just protecting the babies, protecting the mothers. And yeah, thank you so much. Thank you for bringing this bill. Thank you. With that, I yield the well and ask you a favourable consideration of House bill 233. Thank you. The gentleman is yielded. The well is there any objection to the adoption of the House of Memant? The chair here is now in the House of Memant is adopted. On the gentleman's motion, the House agreed to the Senate substitute to House bill 253. All those in favour will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machines. The have all members voted? For what purpose does representative Cameron rise? Pardon me, the inquiry. State your inquiry. Is it true? I'm a speaker that during the process of this bill a baby was surrendered at a box just over the border for me in Tennessee and it was successful in a fire hall and the baby went through the hospital and in the foster care successfully. The gentleman knows of which he speaks. What purpose does representative Clark rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Is it not true that I had a question for the speaker and if he doesn't mind doing a parliamentary inquiry? I'm really curious. I had a town hall and this issue of Ethan's law came up and there were some family law people that were concerned about this outlawing the ability to have families reunite in any type of way and so I just wanted to get clarification on that. Is that not true Madam Speaker? I'm sure the lady knows of which she speaks and encourage her to speak with the original author about that. Have all members voted? If so the clerk will lock the machine on the gentleman's motion. The yeas were 146th and the nays were 15 and the house has agreed to the Senate substitute to house bill 253. Members, we have a special guest. Welcome and join us here in the house. Emma asks Mr. Doorkeeper would you uh Mr. Sir the governor of the great state of Georgia the honorable Brian P. Camp awaits interest to the chamber. Mr. Doorkeeper please admit that governor of the great state of Georgia Governor Brian P. Camp and give him an admitted to this Georgia House of Representatives. Welcome Governor camp Thank you. Thank you. Members and guests, if you'll give me your attention please. We're certainly blessed here in our state to have a first family. I want to recognize, I know you're going to do it again, at least one of them. But I want to recognize the best third daughter in the state, Amy Porter Camp. Thank you for being here. Thank you. I better find this family. And the first lady for our state blessed us earlier with her presence in this chamber. First Lady Marty Camp, you're appreciated in so many different ways by this house and by the people of this state. Thank you for being so proactive in so many issues that imported the Georgians. And thank you for supporting our governor. Let's give a wonderful round of applause to that first lady. The gentleman certainly needs no introduction in these parts. He's led this state through thick and thin. And he's done an outstanding job of bringing good, old-fashioned, common sense back to the job. He said it's a pretty good predecessor. I'll say that as well, who excites those same great qualities. He certainly has done the same. We've got a little bit of work for you governor. We've insinued some bills. We hope you'll keep that pin sharp. At least sign the bills that came out of the house. It's my great honor, y'all. I know it is y'all's will to have the governor of this state in this house chamber, the people's house, a people's governor. The 83rd governor of the great state of Georgia, Governor Brian P. Camp. Thank y'all. Thank y'all so much. Happy signing, everybody. Thank you so much. I just think when the speaker is talking about keeping the pins, sharpening the pins up, I was thinking to myself, they're sharp, or it's just a matter of which color we're going to use. Just kidding, just kidding. Speaker Burns, thank you so much for having me. Speaker Pro Tem Jones, majority leader, Eftration. Our leader, hewly, members of the people's house. I, like you all, are honored to have our great First Lady Marty Camp with us, and Amy Porter. Thank y'all for welcoming them so much this evening. We are very thankful that you have yet again delivered a historic session for the people of our state. Since you gavled the session in just 81 days ago, you have secured another one-time tax refund for Georgia families fighting through the high prices they've experienced over the last four years. They've passed a second tax cut acceleration, which will further help hard work in Georgia and job creators, and save them at least another $725 million a year. I know we are all proud of the work and the much needed relief for those that have been devastated by Hurricane Helene. We also supported legislation to strengthen our workforce, and not only to keep us the number one state for business, but also make us the top state for talent. And together, we have achieved something no other general assembly has done in over a generation, and that has passed meaningful toward reform. Now, I know you all know that fight was hard, and the debates were fierce, but it's my belief at the end of the day we have a common sense, comprehensive piece of legislation that will keep our state moving in the right direction. And while tort reform may have been controversial, and some people may have been for it, and others may have been against it. One thing we all agree on, there's nobody wanted a special session. I also want to thank you for your work on getting FY 2026 budget passed. Chairman Hatchett, thank you for your leadership, and I know it's a lot of hard work this year especially. Included in that budget, there's strategic investments that make our state stronger and further develop our infrastructure. Through those investments, the state is doing what we can to keep people working in all parts of our state no matter your zip code. And they're doing this while returning taxpayer dollars to where they belong to our people. Appreciate the strong support in the back of the chamber. Other states are raising taxes on their citizens just to make ends meet. Think about California, New York, and Maryland, just to name a few. But not here in Georgia, here in the best state for business and opportunity we budget conservatively. And that's why we're able to make historic investments without increasing debt, and are able to give Georgians a third tax rebate, and cut taxes while we're at it. Thankfully, much like years passed throughout my second term, the partnership and thoughtful coordination between the House, the Senate, and my office has benefited the people of our state. And put Georgia on a path to continue prosperity and opportunity. My hope is that we continue that successful streak, which will benefit hard work in Georgians most of all. And as this seventh session during my time in office draws to a close, I want to thank you all for your contributions and your hard work. Marty, the girls and I are grateful for your service to our fellow Georgians. Thank you all, have a great rest of the night, and God bless you. Thank you. Governor Kippin, first family, all at will, come any time in the people's house, can guarantee it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All right, House, the House will come to order. House will come to order. Members, please take your seats. Are we going to move on to a little bit more business for the people?

Okay, members, give the member in the way of your attention. Chairman LeHood is recognized to explain the Senate substitute. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members. This is House Bill 513, sub that the Senate sent back to us and what they did was just add further clarification to help cities and counties avoid conflict and keep their citizens safe as they negotiate their service delivery strategy.

The nasa zero, and the House has agreed to the Senate amendment to House Bill 645. Who will represent the talents that is recognized for a motion? Mr. Speaker, I'll be asking the House for an agreeable on House Bill T33, that was amended in the Senate. Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption? House Bill number 233 to be entitled, an act to amend Article 3, Chapter 3, entitled 50, the official code of Georgia and it's ended relating to other state symbols. So it's the designated bronze muc stews, the official state stew. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to agree with the Senate's up to House Bill T33. The gentleman moves that the House agreed to the Senate's substitute, to House Bill 233. The gentleman's recognized to explain the Senate's substitute. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Section 1. This is the original Brunswick stew bill. It is added in the ingredients to the Brunswick stew. And the extra ingredients include, it makes the 4th Friday, November, National Sugarcane, Serup Day, or Serup Day in Georgia. Section 2 is the original Brunswick stew bill, making the official states of Georgia. We have some great stew downstairs tonight. I call it the North Georgia stew, and they're definitely welcome down there and help us out down in Brunswick. Section 3 is cornbread, it's designated as official bread of Georgia. And Section 4, who was added also by the Senate, will basically it's the four country concerns such as China. This closes the gap of the 3rd party seller with the state agency for goods or services, included a non-limit to contract procurement or purchase of computers, printers, and other types of video conference services and connection of office environments. This was approved unanimously by a partisan effort in the Economic Development Committee in the Senate. Also approved by a partisan effort in the Senate as a body where I think we had one no vote as it is with the standing bill as it's read now. So again, thank you for your favorable consideration. Mr. Speaker, I'll be glad to answer any questions about the Brunswick stew House Bill 233. Gentlemen, has a couple of questions. Yes, sir. Excuse me, leader Heavily has recognized for a question. Give the leader your attention, police. Yes, a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does it gentlemen yield? Yes, ma'am. I understand about these agreements in the stew you got, but this last thing you put on here about these bids for goods and services. Yes, ma'am. Help me understand how that goes with this. This is basically St. Tadalca. This also helps close a loophole where a third party vendor possibly could have gotten a contract from a foreign adversary. Would you agree it might be the same code but a different subject matters? The way we looked at it in the Senate approached it and we approached Letch Council. It seemed to all fit together, ma'am. Gentlemen, take another question. Representative Sanchez. Yes, sir. I can ask for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would like to invoke rule 111 to ask for the germane of this amendment. I don't know how cornbread and Brunswick stew have to do with foreign adversaries. So, we have a question on the germane this on the last section he discussed. And I'm going to chair is going to rule this in this for two reasons. Number one, learned council, Letch Letch Council who will rely on has advised that it is germane. He said in the right place because it's in the right code section so the chair is ruling that it is germane. Gentlemen, has new further questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And I ask for your favorable consideration. Thank you. All in the gentleman's motion that the House agree to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 233. All those in favor will vote yes.

Marshburn and Harrison Edwards for doing a great job. JT was just elected office with the National Republicans and so we're proud of him.

So again JT Harrison thanks for being at the Capitol and you're the future of Georgia. Thank you very much Mr. Speaker. Representative Reeves and members of the Gwinnettin delegation. Gwinnettin delegation. If you'll come down for it. Thank you Speaker Burns. Get them with the spin. Give them a minute. Get down. Gwinnett delegation. Happy bunch. You got one more coming over here. Representative Corrie. Thank you. Gentlemen recognized. Thank you Speaker Burns. Members of the House I have two resolutions from our Gwinnett delegation. The first is Oligar University of India. They have an Alumni Association in Atlanta. They're having a picnic tomorrow in Gwinnett County. To wrap up Ramadhan we have a resolution honoring them. They do interfaith medical missions along with Mercy University and a lot of good cultural things around Georgia. So join us in commending Oligar University Alumni of Atlanta. And then secondly we have a resolution for the Pain Corley House in Duluth. This is a historic preservation that was done by five business women. Judy Borrell, Jane Wilson, Margie Ross, Emma Devers, and then Annette Summer Hour. It's been a wedding venue for years. It's now under ownership of Jen and Alex Kim. Andy Kim works with them and they are doing a great job. There's a florist that is sprung out of that house but it is a perfect example of business women doing historic preservation and doing great business in Georgia. So let's commend the Pain Corley House in Gwinnett County as well. Thank you. I yield well. You got some friends with you too don't you? Representative Derek Jackson and some friends. Gentlemen, hold on just for a minute. Let's get some folks up here and kind of clear out for you. Members, if you're standing in front of the podium there you need to move. You want to split up on each side? Yes. Representative Jackson. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I know earlier we recognize Dr. King but we wanted to come up again because we want to give a moment of silence. Dr. King was not just one who lived his life long he was assassinated and so we like to do a moment of silence because Dr. King made it profound. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Dr. King made a profound contribution to the Civil Rights Movement from 1955 to 1968 advocating for racial equality justice and for the right to vote through nonviolent protests. His leadership in events like the Montgomery bus boycott the March on Washington helped lead to significant legislative victories such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Wondering Rights Act of 1965 which dismantled institutional segregation and secure voting rights for all including African Americans. Today his work continues to serve as a foundation for defending the rights he fought so hard to secure in the face of current challenges including attacks on voting rights and civil liberties and so we want to offer up this moment of silence. Some of us myself and representative I'm going to say Teddy. Teddy Reese we are members of the same fraternity that Dr. King was and that's Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity incorporated so just a moment of silence on our late beloved brother. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Thank you Representative Jackson. Representative Matthew Eck. Chairman Bonner are you on the floor? I don't think he's on the floor do you need to hold up or can you go ahead? The lady's recognized she thinks there there he is. Give the lady your attention please. Representative Matthew Eck. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Chairman Bonner and I this evening would like to honor somebody from Fayetteville who was a constituent of mine but a long time resident of Fayetteville. We're honoring Miss Nancy Nell Spier's Terlano and tonight for other purposes as well she was born May 1937 to her parents Harold and Gertrude Spier's. Nancy was born and had to wear glasses as a baby so this helped her be shape her studious personality. She graduated from Julian Catholic High School in Dayton Ohio and was recognized for her scholastic abilities becoming the second female to graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree in from their prestigious chemistry department. Whereas well at the University of Dayton she was selected by her mentors to be one of the two students in the cutting edge development research department with rare earth metals a groundbreaking process of which you can imagine back then how important that was. She met her husband John also at Dayton University and he was a bat he earned his Bachelor of Science in Physics before attending the Ohio State University. Nancy is one she was one of the first stay at home moms in 1960 and she helped form chemical abstract services which was an applied chemistry degree nomenclature and chemistry. Whereas she was raising her daughters Marilyn and Sharon she contributed to those chemical compounds and later her third daughter is our own Karen Pope one of our great lobbyists here at the at the house.

Members, we have a little procedural situation we will take care of here. We have a number of bills that need to be first read and assigned to committee.

Members, all of those bills have been read and assigned to committee, they'll be up on the website. Members, welcome a former member of this House, back to the House, my friend Doug Stoner, who's now serving Georgia on Georgia Department of Transportation Board. Okay, members, we can take a break in a few minutes. Quite a few minutes. Right now, we're going to take up our, let's see, this looks like a, it's like emotional on House Bill 360. Okay, members, we have some folks who want to hear what's going on. Folks on the wall, everyone needs to be quiet. We have, let's see, it's a, it's a long time to midnight. The bewitching hour is not even close. And we have a lot of work to get done. A lot of hard work to be put in and we're going to finish it up. Our area of frustration is recognized for motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move that this House agreed to House Bill 360 as amended in the Senate. Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption? House Bill 360 be tile and act to amend Article 2 of Chapter 7 of Title 48. Mr. Secretary of State of Related, income tax, imposition rate, computation, exemptions and credits. Conversations need to exit to the any room. Members, I know we have a lot of guests in here, but we will conduct the business of this House. The area of frustration recognized to explain the Senate amendment. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The Senate amendment is really limited. It only operates in three specific areas. The first is that for historic tax credits where participants are already in the queue to receive them. Originally, the bill passed in the House allowed those folks in line for 27, 28 and 29 to be available to come to the front of the line, not replace anyone. Now it's just limited to 27 and 28, so 2029 is out. The second thing is previously this applied only to a limited area, 10 mile radius, which would include the city of Atlanta. That part is also out now, so it would have statewide applicability. And third, for tax credits utilized for 2027 and 28, first, the certificate of occupancy must be by July 1st of 26, not the end of the year. And it would be 90% or 90 cents on the dollar for tax credits utilized in 27 and 85 cents on the dollar for tax credits utilized, wind in line for the 28. Mr. Speaker, I'm happy to answer any questions. The gentleman has no questions. I yield the well. The only gentleman's motion to the House agree to the Senate amendment to House Bill 360.

Good work, sir. Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption to Senate? Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption to Senate Bill 148? Senate Bill 148 by Senator Hatch in the 50th to be entitled an act to amend Article 11 of Chapter 2 of Title 20 of the Fitch go to Georgia and Senator relating to public school property and facility so as to provide for an outdoor learning spaceflight program. This bill, I'm for the committee on education that committee recommends that this bill do pass by rules committee substitute. Representing HONG is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. SB 148 has several components. I'll go pretty quick. Section 2 will establish a pilot program for the development and study of outdoor learning spaces on elementary and secondary school property. Section 1 was Representative Chas Cannons bill, HB 451, which gave authority to local board of education to provide instructions in hunting safety for grades 6 through 12. That was passed out of the floor. Section 3 is Chairman Hawkins, HB 629, which was passed out of committee and that will that requires at least one functional automated external defibrillator on site at K through 12 schools. And then the last section is HB 127 of Representative Brent Cox's bill, which was passed out of the house floor and that will allow teachers from using their sick leave and it extends it from three to five days of their sick leave for personal and professional reasons. I'll take any questions. Mr. Speaker. There's a couple. No, there's one and then we do have a couple of speakers. I'm going to recognize Representative Jasmine Clark. Members, I want to down just a little bit. Representative Clark. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Just a gentle lady yield. I do. Thank you for the bill. I'm just curious. What LC number are you? It's LC 61 0264 s. Is this in our folders or was it put on our desk? It should be on your desk. I did. I don't think. Some of the other rows check and see if that bill is on your desk. You have it? No, it's not in here. Is some of you on my right have the bill? Some of them have it on the front rows. That Representative Holland, do you have it back that far? I have it. I have LC 33 something in our folders. I don't have any. Because I was trying to follow along and I wasn't seeing it. I think what happened the committee subs are being passed out now. The uncontested resolutions kind of slow things down a little bit on getting information passed out. So we'll pause as anyone that needs a copy needs to let us know you need a copy. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Couple copies. These copies down front.

senator All right folks, you clear that scenario and we'll allow the lady to come back to the well. Suspending just for moment. Reptile call this kind of get a little bit of order in here. In fact, let's get a lot of order in here. Okay members. All right members, let's take your seats. We continue to have and legislations that is very important to some audience. Is everyone now have a copy? Okay, Rimsling Hall. Ladies recognize you have no further questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'll take one more question. You have no further questions. I'll come up with one. I don't have one right now. Then I ask for your favorable consideration. I yield well. We do have a couple of speakers. I'm going to allow you three to five minutes. Three sounds really good to me. We're going to start with a teacher. Representative McQueen is recognized. Speak to the bill. Give the lady your attention please. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today in strong support or this evening in strong support of the House substitute to Senate bill 148. A thoughtful and forward looking piece of legislation that takes meaningful steps to support student health and rich classroom experiences and give educators a little more of the flexibility and respect they deserve. This substitute does three important things and every one of them moves us closer to a healthier, more supportive and more effective school environment. First, this bill creates a pilot program for outdoor learning. This is more than a nice idea. It's backed by research. Outdoor learning has been shown to improve student focus, mental health, physical activity, and engagement, especially for younger learners and students who don't thrive in traditional settings. In the wake of the pandemic, we learn just how valuable fresh air and flexible environments can be. This pilot gives Georgia a chance to explore outdoor learning as a practical, scalable tool, not just a trend. We're not mandating. We're learning. We're piloting a program evaluating outcomes and giving districts the ability to innovate in ways that support both academic achievement and student well-being. Second, this bill makes a smart change to our AED requirements. Currently, Georgia law requires a licensed physician to be part of an automated external defibrillator AED program. This substitute removes that requirement, aligning us with best practices in other states. Why? Because AEDs are designed to be used by lay persons in emergencies. They're accessible, automated, and intuitive. By removing unnecessary red tape, we make it easier for schools, athletic programs, and community spaces to expand life-saving access without waiting on paperwork or costly oversight. Third, and I want to speak directly to my fellow educators and school leaders here. This bill increases from three to five. The number of accumulated sick leave days that teachers and school staff can take each year for personal or professional reasons, what teachers normally call personal days. This is small on paper, but it's big and practice. Huge. Our teachers are juggling more than ever. Over crowded classrooms, emotional strengths, second jobs, and family responsibilities, giving them two additional days to take care of themselves, their families, or their professional growth is not just about time, it's about trust. It says, we see you, we value you, we know you need space to be your best. It says we want to retain great teachers, not just recruit them. So what do we have here in SB 148? A pilot that supports students mental and physical health, a common sense health policy that could save lives, a practical change that tells teachers their time matters too. These are smart, modest, bipartisan changes that collectively make a meaningful difference. I commend the Health Education Committee for their work on this substitute, and I urge my colleagues to vote yes for student well-being, for educator dignity, and for a future of thoughtful innovation in Georgia schools. Thank you, and I yield the well. The ladies yield the well, represents a remun, three to five. Please, ladies recognize. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I rise in support of Senate Bill 148. There are incredible sections in this bill, but I wanted to focus particularly on section three, which deals with defibrillators, which I will not have a prop today. I want to talk about why defibrillators in schools are so important, because this is a life-saving measure, and I want to just go through some statistics with you all about what this can actually do. So it's hard to think about a child having a cardiac emergency, but the reality of the situation is that sudden cardiac arrests actually strike 7,000 children and teenagers every single year. While sudden cardiac death among student athletes has prompted a drive to equip athletic facilities with AEDs, research has found that sudden cardiac arrest occurs more often with school-aged non-athletes. So you would think, oh, it's just athletes, but in reality, and just put on the field or with sports or whatever, but the reality situation is that it's actually the non-athletic kids. The other reason this is so important is because about 70% of students survive sudden cardiac arrests, which is more than seven times the overall survival rate for school-aged children. And that's specifically because a child survival rate is estimated to decrease by 10% every passing minute until a shock from a defibrillator is applied. The reality situation is that time is crucial during these emergencies. And when it comes to a child, sometimes waiting for an ambulance, waiting for the emergency medical personnel to get there takes way too long. Not only that, but we're also talking about the teachers that work in those buildings, right? So in addition to saving students' lives, we're also talking about staff that work there, admin, teachers, you name it. The reality is that out of hospitals, sudden cardiac arrests is a leading cause of death in the United States to the point that it claims the lives of approximately 356,000 people per year. That's awful. And so today, I mean, I know this is a great bill. It's a Christmas tree bill. It's got some requirements in here. But the reality situation is this is actually one of my favorite types of legislation because it literally will and can save lives. And I'm incredibly grateful to the authors for bringing this forward and making sure that we are doing all that we can to keep our kids safe and healthy. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the one. The reality has yielded the well leader frustration. Leader frustration is recognized to speak to the bill. Three to five, please sir. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I just want to commend the legislators that worked on the language that ultimately is reflected here in SB 148 bills that are providing this comprehensive piece of legislation underscoring our commitment to enhance educational experiences and ensure the well-being of our students. I would like to thank the members of the committee for the opportunity to represent the members of the chamber who made contributions to this terrific bill. Mr. Speaker, I'd ask the body's favorable consideration. I yield the well. Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in none the previous questions ordered is there any objection with drawing to withdrawing the committee's substitute? Here in none the committee's substitute is withdrawn. Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules? Here in none the rules committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none the report the committee's agreed to shall. This bill now passed all in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? All members voted. All members voted this so, Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? On the passage of Senate bill 148, the yeas, on 165, the nasa zero, the bill head and see the requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. The bill is passed. The bill is passed. The bill is passed. The chairman Powell is recognized for a motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I ask the House agree to the Senate's substitute as amended by the House. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? The House will 651 to be entitled. NACTO MEN, Article 2, Chapter 14, and Title 40, the fiscal code of Georgia, and tentative related speech detection devices. So as we revise provisions relative to the use of automated traffic enforcement, safety devices, and schools others. Chairman Powell is recognized to explain this substitute and the House amendment. Chairman Powell. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen. You got before you a couple of documents. First, I want you to look at the first document I'd like you to look at is the Senate's substitute to House Bill 651. You know, back several weeks ago we were trying to share this problem on these school zone cameras that seemed to have been getting so far out of hand over the last several years. They became quite frank, but I'm going to be very blunt. They became a got you to. They had ceased being a public safety tool, and it was a revenue generator in most people's opinions for those local jurisdictions. We sent a good bill over to the Senate, and I guess I need to tell you a little bit about the process. We sent two bills over. 651 that did a thorough cleanup of this whole actions. Representative Washburn sent over one that basically banned them. There had been a lot of things that transpired the public safety committee in the Senate wouldn't hear the bills. It costed, there was some blood on the floor over there from that. And then these things got amended. Representative Washburn's bill, they basically did a long time extension to do all of them three years, which doesn't cure the problem. They took House Bill 651. I'm just going to go through the changes that they made, and then I will go through the changes we put back in. Section one, they took out the speed indicators. You may remember that I talked about the flashing signs with those speed indicators like radar so that people would know how fast it was driving, and it was slow them down. They took that out. Section two, well the good thing they left in section two was a 10 mile variance that we now have that that's treated the same way as radar with a 10 mile variance. Section three, section three they added language that dealt with the violations and complaints to the Department of Public Safety and G-DOT, especially on intentional violations. In section four, this was a hearing process for those governments. Section five was the appeal process. Section six was the opt out by the officials if they were violating, but also they changed the time. If you remember when this bill left the House, it was two hours in the morning, an hour before an hour after school took in, and an hour before an hour after it let out in the afternoon. And what the Senate did was that they did it from one o'clock from an hour before until hour after, and the local governments could run these all through the day. If they wanted to opt out of any time, they had to opt out. Now we'll get back to that, the changes that we made in the amendment in just a second. One of the things they did was they dropped the fine, where we had dropped it from the extra 25, we dropped it to 125. They had dropped the fine, total fine to 75 dollars, where they 5% surcharge, and that was done suspecting their idea that was to mail out the notice on these. So that's a 75 dollar fine and a $3.75 cents, 5% surcharge for sending out the notices. Where we had taken out the Department of Revenue Lean, they put the lean back in. Those were a lot of the changes that they made and took it out. Now what I'm proposing, and I want to thank a few folks, I want to thank the Speaker's Office for mediating this. Quite frankly, the Lieutenant Governor was adamant that they wanted to be able to run school cameras from before school until afternoon at the behest of the local officials what they thought was needed. If you look on the first amendment that starts on line 14, what we have done is that we have said that they will put those speed indicators back on these signs. So what you'll see, we go back to their original language with the flashing signs, but they'll have those radar indicators that says how fast you're running. So that's in there, and they read that tentatively. Then we get into the hours that starts on line 22 to 41. It defines only on the school day. That's not weekends, and that's not any other time. And the way this is construed, it's kind of difficult to read. But what we have done is we have said that the cities will have to opt in. If they don't pass an ordinance, our resolution of the City Council to opt into the extended day, then it would be from the two hours in the morning and the two hours in the afternoon. If they want to carry through those other hours, they've got to stand up and look at their citizens in passing ordinance to say we want to do this throughout the day. If you look on lines 42 through 47, this deals with the four lanes that they had taken out. And that's quite simple that if they're going to run, if it's going to be allowed to run these devices on a four lane, it has to be where there's a crosswalk. So more of this stuff like up at Tallula Falls, where you got a four lane running out in the middle of nowhere, and there's no crosswalk. So on a four lane, there's got to be a crosswalk before these things would be eligible. If you get on line 48 to 53, this is a notice of a citation. They did leave that in. And the citation just says, failure to pay this, say that's this final test of liability and court, a result in the inability to renew your motor vehicle registration. You go down to the next line. And since they put it back into the department of revenue for a lane, and what we have said in here that they'll send out a second notice to notify the public in bold letters, failure to pay this final contest liability and court within 30 days, a result in the inability to renew your motor vehicle registration line 67 through 76 is the language we change. And their version, they had all the money going to the local police, they could do that for whatever their purposes. We have put the language back in that any of that money needs to go to school safety within that district. And to be used for school safety purposes. Those are the changes. This is the amendment. I would tell you that it is not the best thing that we were hoping for. But I will tell you that when we leave here an hour or two, if we don't pass something that it remains the same, it's still just a wide open. Go at it. This is a, I think with those flashing speed indicators, I think with the 10, with the 10 mile an hour of variance. I think that with all the proper due diligence of notice, I think that this is going to be a workable solution. And then when we come back, if things are still not that way, then we'll be able to deal with it again. But I continue to tell you that this is a path to putting this back as a tool for school safety. Mr. Speaker, I'll be glad to answer any questions if that wasn't clear enough. That's pretty clear. As mud as they say, no, that was good. You did a nice job of informing the members. And if they're a little bit quiet, there's a couple of questions that the questions they want to ask. I'll recognize some members for some questions, but I want you to be able to hear them. Gentlemen, you need to vote for a question. Yes, sir. We're absolutely based more. Just recognize for a question to your left. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Yes, ma'am. Does the chairman yield? Yes, ma'am. Thank you. On page two, line 25. Are you on the amendment? Yes, ma'am. Is this AM 390495? Yes, that's the amendment. Yes, ma'am. Line 25. Should it actually say of 10 miles per hour over the post it, says post it, the speed limit? What we have done is that we have synchronized all of this language with a 10 mile an hour variance. So if it's a post it, 20 miles, and that means 30 miles. Where it says over post it, not should it say over the post it? Ma'am, I didn't write it. That's legislative council, and they certainly write different than we do. Okay. It's put an error that needs to be corrected. I don't think it's an error. Legislative council wrote this language. I know. It was put in the list. Thank you, ma'am. Gentlemen, do you owe for another question? I certainly will. To your left, representative Niel? Do you recognize for a question? Does it determine you? Do you want to determine you? Yes, ma'am. Line 48. 353. 48. I know it. Line 48. 53. So one major issue that my citizens had, one, was the issue of the tax, motor vehicles being, the inability to renew your motor vehicle registration. The second issue we were having is the fact that we have so many erroneous tickets being issued, that there is actually no recourse. You can't hear me. Okay. The issue that I'm having is what 49 to 53 have been put back in is the fact that it feels like we're going back to creating and sitting in the same problem we were trying to alleviate. Because by the time you get the ticket, whether it's erroneous or not, by the time it hits your vehicle registration, when you try to call those numbers, you have no recourse in the courts. You're still forced to just pay your ticket and a lot of people in my communities, they just have to pay all the tickets, whether they get a recourse or not, just because they need their car. That's what we're trying to fix. I think that's your question to General A. Yes, go ahead. As I understand, this was a language that was in the first bill that has been changed in lines, but it says the failure to pay. And this is that first, what you're talking about on those lines, that's the notice that you get when there's been a violation. This says failure to pay this fine or contests the liability in court shows off and inability to renew your motor vehicle. That is the notice that you have received the citation. Then below that is the next notice that if you have not paid the citation, and then before it started over to the revenue department, that's the next notice that you'll notice if you don't pay. If it's erroneous, you don't have a right to cure it because you don't get the option of having the court process because of the way you're specifically structured. Have you ever remedied that? I feel like we have not remedied that problem. This is what was hammered out with these folks when you look at the other language in there that this is the notices on that. When you have it, and I remember when we brought this bill before, but I brought this bill before, that people who contested once they called the court if there was something that was not right like the powers or the speed, then they contested it most of the times they were dismissed. Okay, thank you. Okay, members. We still have some work to do. The other chamber doesn't have any work to do. We're working for the people of Georgia. You can go home if you want to, but I'm going to stay here and ask the members of this chamber to take care of the people's business. We were all elected by the people of this state to come to this place and take care of issues that sometimes we disagree on and those that we agree on. But always with what's in those folks hearts as what's best for Georgians. And I trust that for each and every member in this body. Now, if you're on this floor and you're not a member, you need to tone it down because this house has some work to do. And hopefully we can agree on the work we have left if we don't. That's what this house does. But we're going to move forward. So members, give the gentleman into well your attention. Give the folks asking questions to understand the proposition before respect they deserve. The other side can adjourn and go about their business, but this house is going to tend to the people's business because this is what the people's house. Representative Bennett is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. With the gentleman you all. Yes, ma'am. I just need clarification. Thank you for your thorough explanation. It was kind of challenging to read and listen at the same time. Isn't that true that this bill started out being about cameras and school zones? Is that now removed? And school safety. Yes, ma'am. So the cameras have been removed online 24 where it says using photo graphically and photo graphically has been stricken. Recorded images. What other kind of recorded images will there be? They have not been removed. They have not been removed. They have not been removed. Okay, thank you, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Representative Petrie, chairman Petrie to your left has recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Chairman, do you yield? Yes, sir. Chairman, I just want to make sure I'm clear. Obviously this measure is not what we wanted and it worked.

for several years. I appreciate the great work you've done. But am I correct in on line 78 so all these funds are only now to be used for school safety purposes within schools. Is that correct sir? That is correct. Thank you Mr. Chairman for all your efforts. Thank you. Chairman Dickie has recognized for a question. Does Jim and you? I certainly well. I like Chairman Petry. I appreciate your work and I know it's I'm all for compromise with our friends across the way but isn't it true that this bill really doesn't solve our problem with these cause-owned cameras and I think they're in all of my counties all five of my counties and this is one of the number one issues I hear and this bill just does not change things in my opinion but I appreciate your work on it I appreciate that. Mr. Washman's work on this but I intend to vote against this amendment I just think it does not do the job it needs to be doing and thank you though for the way it worked. Well I thank you and as I said there's a lot of things in here that will tell me these bad to being a tool instead of the gaxi tool that's been used and it's all we've got now I might be this maybe a fitting time to say this and I want to tell the people in this house how proud I am. I understand that the Senate. Continue. I want to tell the members of this house how proud I am that you're still sitting in here and I understand that the Senate has already signed he died. I want to thank Leg Counsel I want to thank Haley and the governor in the Speaker's office. I want to thank the Speaker Chris Riley and all those folks who intermediated a compromise with the Senate. A lot of y'all have heard my opinion over the years about the Senate and how I think so much that you told us to head it right when they had a unit camera by the of the legislature. But we're here doing the people's business as the Speaker had said this was a solution that wasn't a perfect solution by any means but it moved us forward to take the gacha out of safety only in regard to these schools on. Now if this house votes in favor of this but I certainly hope you will it'll probably have no meaning since the Senate's already took off but I want you to know how proud I am of everyone in here for standing by to pass something even when there's a holla suit across the hall. General Yeopard one or two more I certainly will. A gentleman has spent a lot of time working on this proposition recognizing RIPs if you wash print for question give the gentleman your attention please. Thank you Mr. Baker does the chairman you. I certainly will. Mr. Chairman is it not true that you have devoted many hours of time and energy along with the Speaker staff to try to come up with a bill that would rain in and correct many of the abuses that have occurred with the school's own cameras across the state. Is that not true? The gentleman is correct and I thank you for that. Another question will you yield for another question? I certainly will. Is it not true that this has been a joint effort along with me with another bill to try to do something to correct these abuses in the state? It certainly has and as I said earlier I appreciate you because of the position you've been in in the Macon Beb County area where this has probably been one of the most prevalent abuses in the world. So I thank you for your motivation to get involved into this. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Gentlemen you yield for another question. May glad to you. Representative Evans to your left. Representative Evans recognize for a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield over here? Yes ma'am. Since the Senate has decided to go home and you you just mentioned since we're amending what they did I guess it sits and I know he worked on this so hard as has have so many others and this is a problem I mean is there any interest in at least taking what they did so that we could have final passage of something? No ma'am. I do not think that the substitute that they passed has my good friend from Ford Valley had said that this isn't getting it far enough but this gets it far enough to correct a lot of the misuses but this did nothing. This did nothing except make it that much worse. Understood I'm just afraid we're going to end up doing nothing too and I hate it but thank you for your work. Thank you. Mr. Speaker I think that everybody knows the posture. I can tell you that I'd almost say this is the first time in 30 some odd years that I tried to pass a bill when it wasn't anybody to receive it so I felt like I said another historic move but I do want to thank every member of this house for staying in your seats to vote on this so that when the press asks questions it wasn't us. We found a solution ladies and gentlemen. Mr. Speaker I would appreciate the members vote on this last issue and I'll step aside. Gentlemen as you're to the well. Members before I go through the remainder of this bill here's going to be our posture. We have privileged resolutions that import it to the members of this house. We're going to take them up for a few minutes. We're going to figure out exactly what we can do but I think there's some bills that have come across I guess they'll continue working the staff and get them over here too. I said we'll we'll be able to take final action on. So we're going to ask you to stay patient. Stay with us as we move through this bill and then we'll finish our night up and we'll adjourn to this thing and go side and die and come back for next year so with that is there any objection to the adoption of the House Amendment? Here in the House Amendment is adopted. I want to gentlemen's motion that the House agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 651 as amended by the House. All those in favor will vote yes. Those opposed will vote no and Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machines. Morning. All members voted for what purpose is representing Neal rise? The rule 133. The lady has that right and the record will so reflect. Have all members voted. So, Mr. Clerk, were you locked the machine? On the gentleman's motion, the A's are 140 and A's are 29. And the House has agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 651 as amended by the House. The House has agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 651 as amended by the House. The House has agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 651 as amended by the House. The House has agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 651 as amended by the House. The House has agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 651 as amended by the House. So, members, if I can have your attention, let's see if I can convey this information. We have it on the authority of legislative council. That anything we pass, the remainder of this evening, will be in the Senate for action on day one of the session in 2026. My opinion is, we continue to pass legislation that's imported to Georgia's impactful for to Georgians. So, let's just do our work. And I think that's what we should do. I hope you'll agree with me. We're going to conclude with some thank yous a little bit, but I'll go ahead and let you know this. You know, it appears that the Senate has checked all their priorities, all of their political priorities, and decided to end their night early, to set a finish in their work on behalf of the people that we represent. Of course, they're free to do as they please, but this chamber puts policy over politics. And they're still plenty of good, common sense policy left on this House as agenda. And we're going to take it up. And we're going to continue to work for the people of Georgia just a little bit longer. I'm going to ask you to stand in these for about 15 minutes. Let us make sure we get a few pieces of information back from the clerk of the Senate, the Secretary of the Senate. And then we'll move on with the business of this House for the good of the people of Georgia. Thank you members. This House will stand at these until 10 minutes until 10.
