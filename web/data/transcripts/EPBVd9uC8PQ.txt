TRANSCRIPT
----------
Thank you. Thank you everybody for being here. Let's bring the Senate Health and Human Services Committee meeting to order. And apologize for being late. That was on the Senate Rules Committee. But we're here. And if we can open up in prayer, Senator Jackson, floor is yours. Let us pray. We pray for the workers and for those who serve. Give us wisdom as we seek to make laws that will help better us all. Amen. Thank you, Senator Jackson. Certainly appreciate that. We certainly all need that on these final days of the session. Senator Lucas. Let me make sure everybody is on the same page. We're doing today. We're going to do hearings only today. We still have tomorrow morning, or unless we change the rules to get this done. We're doing House Bill 520 today. We're going to do hearing only. And we're going to House Bill 343 hearing only. So let me repeat. We're not going to take a vote today. We're going, we still have the possibility of calling a meeting in the morning. And we still have possibility of suspending the rules if we so choose and change Senate rules. So that's always a possibility. But that is the stance and the position that we're in today. House Bill 520 has been a work since last year. It is the companion bill of House Bill 1013. We have had multiple discussions, multiple different versions of this bill. In your folder that everyone has had this bill in their office since this morning about 9 a.m. We've had several different versions. We're on LC-339522S. And we, or what we're going to do today relating to this bill is that I'm going to present the bill as we did last year with 1013. And we're going to go through the changes that have happened since then. And then we're going to hear pro and con on this bill. And we'll take a hint from the person who is carrying the bill. Senator Chairman Strickland as he did in judiciary the other night. And I thought that was a good idea. We're going to have con go first and then pro. And we're going to have 20 minutes of on each side. And the person who gets up there first is if they take up all 20 minutes that shame on you. But that's where we're going to be. We're going to be 20 minutes on each side. And we'll be respectful. I hope you're respectful of all the other members who may be forward or against it. I would ask you to listen carefully to the changes that we have done. And then after the pro and con on that with the testimony that we'll have, we're going to have questions from our committee for further any delineation relating to this. And that's the stance that we're in. So having said that, let's get started. So again, substitute the house bill 520 LC 339522S. The preamble obviously by the first two pages. We're getting to the bill in section one has having to do with the DCH and conducting a study. We had no changes related to that. That has to do with the psychiatric treatment, residential facilities. We've heard a lot about PTRFs and the relationship to the funding and appropriations relating to that. I apologize. Let me be clear on where we are. Last time we didn't have a Capitol police, a Georgia state patrol. We do this time. I just want to be, let's keep this respectful. Please know clapping or cheering or outbursts relating to that. Let's just let's be civil to each other and respectful to each other. So thank you very much. I apologize for having to say that. So the old moving on with the bill, the old session section 2 has been completely removed. That was the step therapy. We felt that it was premature relating to the definition and that I'll discuss that in just a minute that is still pending. Department of insurance issues, existing legislation relating to step therapy and so forth. The new section 2, which you see in your folders committee, line 63, made changes mainly about the definition. As Senator Setsler had pointed out earlier, the agency was making the definition and going with that. That left out the legislature. We were doing, let me digress, I'm sorry, the definition that we're talking about is for a serious mental illness. So we want all the agencies to be using the same definition for all serious mental illnesses. And that's the definition will be proposed and will come back to the general assembly for its recommendation. And you'll see that on line 80. She'll be proposed and it's to the general assembly no later than December 1, 2023. In 37132, line 100, there's been no change in that section except relating to line 120. The clearinghouse shall provide annual reports to the general assembly rather than may or authorize that. Again, it's involving the general assembly is the legislative branch versus the agency and executive branch and involves us. And mainly for communication because you'll see some part of this theme is a communication issue that we all want to have addressed and I want to keep on the same page. Lines 131 in the next section. Apologize continuing on with the same section. One of the major differences we did in the bill that was previously left undefined also was the familiar faces. And what we did was we continued on with what is defined in code section already and continued with the definition that we use from that section including frequently cycle through jails. And this is familiar faces homeless shelters emergency departments and other crisis services. So we define that and refer to the code that is already defined with that. 37133 this was a pilot program to help with the health behavior commission and especially judge box who is in charge of the jails and the judicial branch and has needs to know who is in jail. And the mental health issues involved in those folks in jail to reduce recidivism and that's the main issue relating to that reducing recidivism. He needed the information and we're going to continue to allow that in a pilot program and see if we can get that started again relating to familiar faces. And that's in line 159 again that we did define. 163 section 3. We made no changes. We added in improved in the commission the behavior health reform and innovation commission is composed was composed of 24 were proposing it to be changed to 26 and adding to peer support specialist. So we're going to be appointed by the president senate one to be appointed by the speaker the house. That's the only changes in that section. Section 4 lines 198 again. We do with the proposed definition of serious mental illness and these were minimum changes in that section for mostly scripted as a era is actually if you look on line 222 community base should need a hyphen and in online 226 it was a scripted as a programatical era that it was it's obviously not a forensic peer monitor but a forensic peer mentor and so that was just the wrong word in there so that we that we change that let me I'm going to digress here a little bit and separate out. And looking at the changes where we are with this we've been working with the house we've worked with our lieutenant governor's office we work with our majority leaders office we've worked with legislative council senator Kirkpatrick has spent many many hours on this as have I chairman chairman's trickling is also been right there along with us we we've had many many meetings on this many hours and I will tell you just looking I'm digressing and getting off off of script here but if you look at the last page we're on page last page is 31 it was 44 pages when we started there were 11 lines in the original section and now there's 775 so I want to be clear because I'm even I'm off script here a little bit I want to be clear in what we have tried to do we've loo we have done we've reduced a lot of redundancies we have tried to make it clear we have left things out when we did not feel as if we needed to tackle that at this particular moment and and that's sort of the first thing we do is we have to do that. So we have to do that in the first part of the thought process where we are. On line 232 back to section 5 this is the bed study for psychiatric beds this has been an issue if you following along in appropriations that the psychiatric beds for both child and adolescent folks has has been a major issue and that has to do with end state versus out of state. We to define that and find that how to pay for that and to define how many end state versus out of state private versus public and getting a whole picture relating to that so we did take a lot of the language of this particular section out removed cleaned up redundancy but we did do the same intent. On line 254 this has to do with competency evaluation restoration services so that we heard many times in appropriations how back logs we're holding up the care for people sometimes mental health issues and people that were arrested for minor health minor misdemeanor changes in that they would say in their longer than their actual sentence. So that was what we listened to and that's what the formal review getting that done. Another theme that we have throughout the legislation is that the Department of Justice settlement that we are still under that goes back about 15 years before all of us here were on we're in the legislature. So we all but maybe I'm sorry when we apologize senator or rock maybe senator settler and senator butler you know I hate singling you out apologize about that and Lucas may I senator Lucas may have been in the house but for most of us this Department of Justice 15 years of settlement and it's not a secret that commissioner Tanner Department of Behavior Health and Developmental Disabilities is working. With the Department of Justice and we'll be working with them and meeting with them and actually in August I think it's when that is scheduled. The intent that we have in some of these some of the language in here in the tent that we have with some of these studies is for that explicit purpose to help Kevin Tanner and his team is not just him and his team help get us out from under the Department of Justice settlement. So that's that's part of that and that's part of this what this next part relating to line 265 relating to the homeless population. That's part of that answer it's not the whole part the only reason that we're convening a task force to study the homeless population but it is part of it. So lines on section 6 there are no changes but we did clean up the and left in the language relating to assisted outpatient treatment and that basically struck out most of that language we did not take out any of the strikes or any relationships that that is clean up language and takes out much of that law. Okay 283 282 283 section 6. So no changes on that but those were mostly strikes and completely clean up language. Section 7 340 this is a section that allows or delegates folks and on the behavior coordinating council someone to stand in their place and be counted for the quorum that is sort of that is routine language it authorizes to be represented by delegate and it lists the from 358 down to 363 section 8 repeals and reserves that section that there are no changes there section 9 and 10 go together. And we listened I think to a lot of folks and went back and forth try to refine the language but basically removed the redacted aspect of the affidavits completely. Let me let me be clear on that. We we strengthen existing law that's the only section to that bill that we left in there and let me read that section to you so if a physician certificate or affidavit. I'm reading online 388 we strengthen that to make sure that that follows that person to court and the same thing in section 10. But let me be clear and we repeat this I hate hate it when people repeat things but I think for for everybody to understand we removed the section relating to the redaction or removal of the names when it came to the 10 13 form we took that out completely. That was section 10 9 and 10. If anybody's following along from an old bill gone as a whole section concerning the requirement of the licensing study we completely removed that because we are doing a study committee my vice chair and chair that's a committee reminds me to make sure we're clear on that section 11 allows the licensure of LPCs license professional and the counselor social workers and marriage and therapist. And what we did there is this is a workforce issue DB HDD is have is struggling hiring those I mentioned and what this did would allow someone who's maintained their license. And this will allow them with two full years of experience in another state to be accepted into our state it is a workforce and a red tape issue and that's what we did. So we're going to be clear on that own line 438 section 12 and actually section 12 and 13 go together again we're dealing with mental health workers. The license professional counselor social workers marriage and family therapist and section 13 related to nursing this has to do with what's been going on in the physicians dental veterinarians for decades now. We this is the professional health programs of the php's relating to impaired physicians dentist and veterinarians that we have applied that and that has been working very successfully and this is going to apply to these therapists LPC social workers marriage family therapist and nurses that section 12 and section 13. So what we did was we actually lifted that language from those codes that have been in law since the 1970s. So let me be clear on this also monitoring and rehabilitation has nothing to do with ankle monitors has nothing to do with any devices worn here. And I will tell you what it does do it has to do with substance abuse and disorder or substance abuse disorder it has to do with P in a cup. And that's what we do when physicians veterinarians or dentists have a substance abuse disorder that is part of the monitoring program. And personally as a physician I've taken care of people in the php program and that's what they do sometimes they do it daily sometimes they do it weekly usually is over a five year period and then they may graduate out of it or they may not. If they don't do the five years generally remember it takes about a year or so for people's brains to get closer to normal after you've been in a substance abuse disorder. So monitored very closely no ankle monitors no devices nothing like that been going on since the 1970s. And then let me line 485 there were issues relating to the contracts and the immunity the contracts are explicit does not release liability does not give them immunity it is in those contracts. That's where we are with the standard of care relating to that. So that's section 12 and 13 line 539 section 14 or the new section 14 is 14 the is this can be old after we discuss it today but that has been simplified and restricted that had to do with it that has to do with the Georgia data analytics center. And these basically we colloquially call this on multiple sessions the agencies please communicate with each other that's what we did we didn't use the police term but we did this agencies communicate and that's what that is that was 10 pages it is now three pages. And what we did basically is substituted last year a bill by Senator Tillery SB 347 in 2022 and we put that in that particular section those three pages and that's what it is. So it basically requires them to communicate. Let me be clear on this on lines 587 in or agency and intra agency data sharing under this part does not constitute a disclosure or release under any statutory administrative law that governs the government information and no events shall government information be access received obtained which is protected by any form of confidentiality or privilege. And call such information to be subject to disclosure including but not limited to disclosure to the codes and basically what that means is that all state and federal privacy laws will be followed. Hippas what I operate under all the time and all the federal and other federal and privacy laws are done that we also helped with communication and constitutionality took this away from the from GDAQ and gave it to the office of planning and budget so that we would have the authority and they OPB would report to the chairpersons of the Senate and House appropriations committee. So again tying that back from a legislative overview. Oh and by the way again all aggregated data is de-identified no names no personal information nothing. It is and is also we added and reinforced that the state auditor can continue to review that and make sure that that's appropriate. Section 16 is basically DCH technical and regulatory changes we've supported this section we added extra time but let me discuss the money and the issues that have been raised. Line 616 a lot of information has been out there and we'll try to clear some of that up the psychological diagnostic assessments and treatment that will access a state plan. Number two line 620 reimbursement for services provided by LPCs marriage family therapist at federally health qualified centers no calls to the state. Psychiatric hospitals is eligible facility type for providing inpatient psychiatric facilities that is a re procurement of the request for proposals relating to the CMOs that have gone out they did request for qualifications and now they're doing requests for proposals which will be followed that will be handled under that. Reavage numbers line 626 number four reavage reavaluation updating and Medicaid reimbursement rates for autism spectrum disorder disorder again another rate study spurred by hoteling the hearing that we held on hoteling especially with Dr. Zena's testimony. 634 line five reimbursements for Elevel Justice and Bob use 18 to 21 again that's the that's the youth in jail 18 to 21 considered an adult those will be of course when the ACA waiver not a Medicaid waiver and ACA waiver those will be rolled on to that particular plan. Number six 635 foster children they did try to separate those out initially that was rejected by CMS that will be done also in the procurement and include foster children in the procurement aspect of that. Section 17 no changes in that that's three or four lines section 647 no change but we did note that the again personal data is all taken out we need we do certainly need to get the complete picture when it comes to license health care professionals whether they're retired a part time they're listed on those pages. 2627 and again in the law line 690 is non identifying descriptive data of these individuals and the reason is so there are no names no personal information is given a related to that we need the numbers to see how many people we have to get an accurate picture of that that's what we're looking for information data so we can make some appropriate decisions. Okay. On line 715 what we're doing 49 10 7 how many to do with the loan changes we did make changes relating to this section relating to capping how much can be forgiven. We wanted to point out that the what this actually is and this has been audited by the Department of Audits and this if you'll stand with me in rural areas physicians and PAs and AA's they this program has been going on for quite some time it has been a very successful program so one of the most successful programs we have. And what happens is when that physician PA or AA or I'm sorry PA and nurse practitioner or physician serves a year of service then one year or 10% of their loan is forgiven so it is after you have done the service. So that's where we are with that so after the service 10% we changed the amount there but it is for services rendered. Very successful is helped out our rural areas tremendously and I hope we'll continue to help out when it's relating to mental health workforce. We did add in there that the recipients must be in professional good standing relating to that relating to their license I think that's sort of self explanatory. Section 20 relating to housing we took that out completely again on emphasize that we've gone from 44 pages to 31 we've gone from 11 lines now down to 775. Did I say did I mistake them one time? 1,100 and 11 I say it right this time thank you. All right so that's the bill we're going to do a con first and as I stated earlier Senator Strickland had a good thing the other night now we did go to little after nine o'clock in the judiciary I don't plan on being here that long but we're going to do that. But we're going to give 20 minutes of testimony against in 20 minutes of testimony with I would hope that you would take the things that we made the changes in consideration and be considered of other folks who may have signed up both pro and con. Okay.

Malary staples and then Hank Sullivan is in that. In the if you can go ahead we obviously need to get theirs. So Miss Staples and Hank Sullivan and Shannon Weimer. Well that is a little bit like drinking from a fire hose for those of us out here trying to keep up. So if our thoughts are not completely organized please understand. I know a lot of the legislators comment on having one day to read a bill and we didn't even get to read it and it was very difficult to even mentally process what y'all are being said. So if we lack accuracy or granularity in our arguments please take that into consideration. I was able to speak at the subcommittee hearing previously and my arguments would be the same. We look to you guys as our leaders around that table for your leadership, for your ingenuity, for your efficiency, for your good stewardship of our money. And I would ask that you give the private sector an opportunity to address the needs of the people. And there are needs and by your admission we're not sure exactly what those are. We don't have the data. We can't actually present that type of numbers and beds and cases and root cause which I mentioned before. We're not even sure. It hasn't been analyzed why there's a spike in mental health issues, why we're seeing what we're seeing since COVID. But we are wholly confident. I was in a hearing at two o'clock where they made a joke about a stat that showed that the government had actually outperformed the private sector in one instance and everybody died laughing because that never happens. And we would like to see the private sector meet the needs of the people, meet them with compassion, with ingenuity, with efficiency. What we're asking of you, we would ask you to please move outside of government as the answer. We want the people that need help to get it and get it excellently. And we want to free up the backs of the taxpayers. There's no reason those things cannot happen at the exact same time. And despite representative Oliver's depiction on lawmakers last night of those of us that oppose this bill and our numbers are massive, we are not French. We do not call for no government. We are compassionate group of people that respect our government, but would like to see it limited and would like to see citizens get the care the best care that they need without overtaxing the voters and the taxpayers. So thank you so much for your time. And I wish I had more opportunity to to read Chairman Watson what you just shared with us, but that was not available. So it's the best we can do. Thank you so much. And this is a hearing we're not voting so it is available. Yes, moving forward. We'll look at that. Certainly. Thank you. So we stopped her time. So we got 17 minutes and 26 seconds. She's very efficient. So Hank Sullivan and Shannon Weimer. And then Paul Hershey after that. I appreciate the opportunity before I start. I wonder if the chairman would read me the definition of the term monitor from the bill. You know, this is again taken from the 1970s is what we're doing for that. Well, I'm asking for the term to be defined here in this bill. This bill is not defined. It is practiced in law since 1970. Well, I'm not going to argue with you, but you can. I don't see that any of this has changed because the bill only uses a loose term that we're supposed to interpret. And if we don't interpret and you don't interpret, then that's going to leave Mr. Tanner's department to do the interpreting. So we don't know what that really means. And I suggest that it would be a good thing for the board to interpret that for us in writing in the law. Because unless you do, it can mean anything that the department in charge of administering this can interpret to mean. So that said, I don't see that anything that I've come to say here is changed. So here's some questions that I want to pose before the board. Does HP 520 require GPS and biometric monitoring of possibly thousands of individuals across the state of Georgia? I say that it can. Does HP 520 sponsor own a patent on GPS and biometric monitoring? Yes. Does HP 520 sponsor operate a company whose sole business is to market and service his patented device? Yes. Does HP 520 sponsor have equity partners in his company? Yes. I got you. I see where you're going with this. And I'd be honest with you. I didn't really appreciate what you were saying about the sponsor. I did explain that the monitor, what we did, what impaired physicians, dentists and veterinarians do with their monitoring. There is no monitoring of devices at all. It's never been going on. And there's no definition. It's not being done. Why would be the objection to defining the term in the bill? Listen, I got it. I understand that. We'll consider it. I appreciate that. I don't want a misinterpretation of the sponsor of the bill to think that what is going on now with substance abuse, drug disorder and what we call, you know, peeing in a cup. And there has never been any monitoring from that perspective when it comes to impaired physicians, veterinarians, dentists and so forth. Does the law preclude the word monitoring to mean that? You know, it can be interpreted. That's my point. I guess it can be interpreted to mean anything is not being done. And we're we plan to the plan is the same kind of program that's being done now. With respect. Okay. All right. But if you don't mind, just please don't use the author in this because that the intent is not there by any means. I see what you're in 10. Thank you. You're welcome. All right. So we got we've stopped it in 16 minutes 15 seconds is next. Hi. Thank you, Chairman, for the opportunity to speak. I'm going to do the best I can because we were firehosed with a lot of changes. So I apologize if some of this isn't exactly what we're looking for. I too am looking for a definition on what some of these these terms are. Would you mind identifying yourself? I'm sorry. I'm Shannon Weimer and Cherokee County. I represent myself. I'm spending. I'm sorry. Listening to the SB 140 hearing yesterday. I heard countless members of the General Assembly speak about the need to keep government out of medical decisions. Yet when it comes to the subject of mental health, we encourage government to not only interfere, but also have explicit control over the data collected. And it sounds like we don't even know how to fund it yet. Which means government our tax dollars. I quote house speaker burns mental health issues are not one one size fits all issue. I couldn't agree more. A loss should not be passed to create a one size fits all regulation over every Georgian. I am going to bring up representative Todd Jones. He is the sponsor of this bill. He yesterday said it's about data sharing and making sure we get better predictions and understanding what our infrastructure is to serve mental health. His words. Let's talk about that infrastructure and the cost that's attached to it. Patton number one one five zero seven nine zero nine was filed in May of 2021 by Teletrix Holdings LLC. And it was invented by Todd Jones. Who also authors this bill. This does raise flags to the intent behind this bill. Who will be paying the epox approximately 71 million dollars in Medicaid expansion. We the taxpayers if you don't have another solution. I haven't seen any any recording or record of that yet. And who stands to receive money is for that. The not a Georgians but the infrastructure that supports it. Currently there are several private sector mental health agencies that have already been mentioned in prior hearings making headway in the mental health fight. Has there been any assessment on the benefits if even a fraction of that 71 million dollars of our tax dollars went to those existing private mental health facilities. What does it look like for the churches I see outside with long lines having access to some of that mental health fund to better communities to better the communities where it's needed most. I'm understanding that when a bill is introduced before it can be passed it must have a fiscal explanation I've learned a little bit that you explain so. But how it's going to be funded impacts whether or not it will. The and has the impact on the existed proposed budget. I haven't seen an explanation on how this bill will be funded and many of us are concerned with that 71 million dollars is a lot of money. Nor have I seen a path of execution that will pose a greater benefit for the majority of the citizens in Georgia just that small percentage I keep hearing representative speak about. I see yet another opportunity for our private constitutionally protected data to be harvested and it makes me sick. Where does this stop we are proposing to allow mental health data a client patient privilege protected by due process to be shared to an independent agency and grant access to the government. What is then to stop the sharing of data from an attorney client privilege of a mental if mental health is involved mental health support is needed I agree 100% and in the 90s the private sector agencies were leading the charge I watch the majority of those private agencies. They were converted to government agencies and now we have a greater mental health issue than we ever have before. This is we are asking the government to fix a growing plague of this issue this is not a government issue it's a personal deeply intimate issue that the government cannot realistically execute for better benefit of the citizens. The level of increase of government control of data taxpayer money being spent without due diligence of fiscal approval and over 20 points of law changes being slammed into a single bill tells us that this bill is nowhere near ready for a vote on the floor I urge you to not allow this bill out of committee thank you for time. Paul Hershey and Bill Quinn is on deck Michelle Sargussen is after that. Good afternoon my name is Paul Hershey 11 Cherokee County. The thing that I'd like to dress is why this bill. I'm saying that is how many of the youth senators have rather report one of the OJ and stated Georgia from 16 18 20 and the one is coming out in 22. Because everything that you're addressing right now is being done by Kevin Tanner's department. You do not need a bill to have committees because under I think it's five dash two of the house. The speaker of the house can can institute any committees to do the study. But my question is is this why why do we have the studies when if you look at the 16 18 20 and 22 report to the DOJ. You're right we have got some shortfalls but that's all being done by a 1.4 billion dollar budget that you've given Kevin Turner. So why do you need any additional money for the study the bed count that you're looking for was in the 2020 study. Does anybody realize that? My point is is this is that this bill needs to be researched more. We need to do a fiduciary responsibility for the spinning of money. And it's not billed in by anybody that's voting yes on this bill. And I challenge you to find fault when anything like you said. Because all we've got to do is read those read those reports. This bill is not needed. Yes we have problems in the mental health facilities. But let's talk about that. The state of Georgia created their own quagmire when they agreed to the 2010 agreement when you released a lot of people out of the program. And given get out of jail cards and then they turned into the familiar faces. And then they're trying to fix a program that we messed up. And again read the study read the results from the DOJ settlement. We need to fix the mental health side but this is not the way to do it. Thank you. Thank you miss Hershey. We have a 9 minutes 52 seconds left. Bill Quinn and then Michelle and then Brett Kromy. Good afternoon. Bill Quinn. I'm representing myself. So the chairman's comments on the changes that have been made were welcome. We see progress in some of those. There remains some serious deep questions though based on some of the things. If I understood correctly are still in the bill. The first and probably foremost is this notion of the definition of what is serious mental illness. It is absolutely central to most of the work that will go on in this bill. And yet remains according to what I understand undefined until December of this year. That's two weeks before the next session. How is progress supposed to be made and how are folks supposed to have confidence in something where we're plowing forward. And we don't know where we're headed. We don't have the ability to have confidence in that. The other thing is if you look through the bill. And again unless I misunderstood your comments, Mr. Chairman. There still seems to be some areas of question that I would have. So for example, what used to be section 14 defines entity as an organization or medical professional association which conducts professional health programs fairly broad. Further in that section it says, Andy Entity, the contracts with the board pursuant to this code section shall be immune from any liability, civil or criminal that might otherwise be incurred or imposed for the performance of any functions or duties under the contract if performed in accordance with the terms of the contract and the provisions of the code section. So to me, let me be a devil's advocate. An association, an organization makes a mistake, harms people, hopefully not by design. But this would give them complete immunity, would it not? Concerning to me. So I will close with a quote that is just about a year old. But it seems to be very appropriate for today. I would like everybody to just take one moment to consider the pain filirony of us in this body. Working to find a government solution that implements greater government control in order to solve a problem that is largely the result of government control and policies. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Quinn. Michelle Sarkerson. I think I missed the pronounce. It's close enough. And Brett Kromy is next and then Jamie Tucker and we're at seven minutes and 24 seconds. I'll try to go fast. Hi, my name is Michelle Sarkesian and I am not paid to support or oppose anything. I along with masses of constituents, I know and speak with adamantly opposed HB520, not at all because we are against government and certainly not because we do not have concern for the seriously mental ill. It is because it is outrageous government overreach for problems not yet defined. This bill does not solve for families and certainly not for children struggling with mental illness. I watched the recent law makers session where the sponsors of 520 described the target of the bill is a fraction of a percent of Georgians called familiar faces who use way to many resources. You mentioned that today. While I recently met with Todd Jones, I suggested this bill based on that defined audience is the equivalent of boiling the ocean to cook a shrimp. You are all likely good people with good intentions and I even know one senator who is conflicted on this bill because they are a great friend of one of the sponsors. Of course, that's not a reason to support bad legislation, but I get it. However, because those familiar faces use too many resources, the demands taxpayers fix the workforce shortage by paying for student loans and think about that. It's not going to go over well with the 60 percent of Georgians that did not attend college. It sets a terrible bad precedent for any other essential career that might seek the same downstream. Additionally, the bill infringes on freedoms and rights by allowing affidavits of two persons to deem and detain another is mentally ill. I don't know where you are in the subsidized housing. It sounds like that's being addressed. And I don't know where you are exactly on monitoring, but the bill is very vague about what monitoring is. It's not described as paying in a cup. There is more, of course, but the real issue your constituents of horror is the overreach. A little creativity on many topics you have designed solutions for would serve taxpayers and maybe even the problems better. For example, take workforce needs. You could easily implement the portability and state-to-state reciprocity described and see how better it works to solve for the workforce problem. You could encourage signing bonus that are temporary rather than taxpayer-funded student loans. That is more of a marketplace solution. You could accelerate apprenticeship programs all far less overreach than student loan payments. You get the idea. Along with thousands of others, Georgians ask you to do far more research and studies to properly define needs before you consider the overreach here. By the way, anyone truly interested in the skyrocketing mental illness in Georgia would do all families a great service by looking at the root causes of mental illness. And the impaired judgment that goes along with it. There are many resources that can provide helpful information. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Archonson. Brett, Kromy, and Jamie Tucker can share the four minutes and 17 seconds. Thank you. Not a lobbyist or a member of a special-in-this group, but rather a spokesperson for We The People. This is not a good bill. This is not a simple bill. I and others have had many discussions and good faith to help fix the bill and assuage our concerns about it. Unfortunately, this is not stopped the runaway train of government overreach trying to fix a real problem of mental health. However, we need to balance individual liberty as we do this. Many of the problems I have already been spoken to, but I'll mention two that I've not yet talked about. So most of these fixes are Democrat party ideas. If it was a Democrat majority in the Senate, I would see those ideas made sense. Medicaid expansion and loan forgiveness. These are not part of the Republican party platform, at least when I checked. Why not incentivize the industry with signing bonuses, for example? That was already mentioned. This bill goes directly against the Georgia Code, Article 3, Section 5, Paragraph 3. No bill shall pass that refers to more than one subject matter. And it's pretty clear that there's about 50 subject matters in this bill. So there's insufficient guardrails protecting individual liberty throughout this bill. Most of these have already been mentioned. We, the people are committed to help fix this bill. What we need to table it until next year and break it into one idea per bill. Thank you. Jamie Tucker, there's three minutes and one second left. You can take it up if anybody else wants to sign up. Oh, I'm sorry. We do have more. So, okay. We'll three minutes or less. One second. Thank you. My name is Jamie Tucker. You'll see that in this room, half of it are people like me who are not being paid to be here. Instead, we're taking time off of our work to protect our freedoms. And we are literally begging you to stop the government expansion. This is Obama era expansion of Medicare. And as Mr. Keision said, it's not addressing the root cause. You keep throwing our money at it. And it doesn't get fixed. And instead you've created yet another government quagmire. And now you've convoluted it with special interests. In fact, Mr. Barrett is in here. He is also a shareholder in talletrix, the monitoring company. And again, we're going to get back to that definition because words and terms are important. Many lawyers are in this room. The other half of the room is filled with lobbyists, former drug addicts like Mr. Breedlove who are begging the rest of us in this community to pay for all the things that he did wrong. These are big issues. You need to define your terms. You cannot legislate unless you want to be Nancy Pelosi and pass the bill first so that you can later on see what's in the bill. I want a definition of serious mental illness before anyone signs this bill. I would never do that to anyone else. And it's disgusting that you would even consider signing something without that definition. All the other issues I had were brought up the immunity to contractors providing quote unquote mental health services. It's a joke. The conflicts of interest also with Senator Dolezal, another person who has a monetary conflict of interest with the monitoring. I don't know what you said about the felons who are allowed to have their criminal history hidden from their landlords after four years if you remove that section wasn't clear to me because yet again you gave us two seconds to digest the 1100 words down to 700 words or however many pages it now is sharing data across multiple state agencies is extremely dangerous and very risky. I don't care how good you are trying to protect it you as a physician should know that hippas been violated in so many ways already and this is just yet another opportunity to violate and steal personal data whether you say it's de identified or not there's always a key to link that person. That is all I have to say I pray that you will do the right thing here and remember that you are supposed to be beholden to republican tenants and you're not Democrats although you sure act like them. So we do have about 30 seconds left. Marie Sparowski Marie I'm sorry Marie Barowski and Jody Robinson if this time left. Thank you for your time neighbors and your educated eloquent speech. That's not me. I hear these words and a lot of it doesn't really make sense. However, the overall tone definitely feels like this bill needs more research this bill needs to be reduced maybe it needs to be separate pieces. But first I would implore you and I would fully support funding for private organizations I would support the government with their little committee talking to private organizations in order to solve the problem. The public can solve it better than government. Thank you for your time. Thank you. So now would do 20 minutes for the next one. Those in favor will start off with Mr. Jeff Breedlove. Mr. Breedlove. Before we begin can I ask how many have signed up for the process? One two three four. Eight. Thank you. My name is Jeff Breedlove. I'm a person in long term recovery from 30 years of active addiction. It is my great privilege to be here today on behalf of the Georgia Council for recovery and for two coalitions representing over 60 organizations active in communities across our state, the mental health policy partnership and the substance use this order policy partnership. I say many times behind this podium that I worked for the state Senate for seven years and today is one of the days and I'm very proud to say that. I want to begin by saying thank you. First and foremost to the chairman and into the senator from the 30 second in particular in the 17th in particular who have worked tirelessly in a positive way seeking positive solutions to very serious problems. And we've met with most of the members on this committee and we thank each of you for your time. This bill is not just needed. It is essential to save lives. I'm a sinner. You see, I'm a follower of Jesus Christ and I'm saved by his blood and his sacrifice from the cross. But let me tell you this. I'm no doctor and I didn't stay at a holiday and express last night. But I know one thing. Having a medical issue, having a disease is not a sin. There are some 24 million people in the United States, some 800,000 in communities across Georgia who have been blessed to be survivors of what someone just said was mistakes. Last year, the CDC tells us, I'm sure some people don't trust the CDC, but they tell us that some 108,000 people died from opioid overdoses alone. That's not even getting into alcohol and all the other substances. Let me tell you what that means to you. If the Braves filled up, tourist filled, if the Falcons sold out Mercedes-Benz and the Hulk sold out state farm arena on the same day, you'd be right at about 108,000 people. This is not about politics. This is not about emails that contain misinformation. About things alluded in federal and state law, which simply are not true. Now, I don't talk about my professional background in politics and that would be improper. But you know it. This is not a Republican issue or a Democrat issue. This is a life and death issue. You've gotten the emails. You know what's true and not true. You know who is working positively to save lives in your districts and you know who's playing politics. It's a time for choosing in the Senate. Are we going to advance a bill to save lives? Are we going to listen to conspiracy theories, insults, in allegations, in inaccuracies, in character assassinations? I know the Senate will do the right thing.

Because at the core of this, when you go to a funeral of a constituent in your district, nobody is going to ask if they voted Republican or Democrat. Do we need the private sector to help you bet we do? George, it's the number one state to do business in the nation. There's good businesses doing good work in the private sector today, and they desperately need the state to do more. There's good people in the faith community. At places of houses of worship, of all denominations, breaking stigma every day to do good work in this area of behavioral health, mental health and addiction, but they need the government to help. I'm not fearful of the government. I don't distrust the government. And the people that I represent today, the survivors of this disease, we beg you for your help. We thank you for your help. We ask you to do more. We're taxpayers too. We like our civil liberties too. We like our constitutional rights. We love our families and are loved by our families. It's not over, it's not overreaching. Let me conclude by saying this. House Bill 520 is not overreaching. It's pro family, it's pro faith, it's pro peer, it's pro medicine, it's pro law enforcement, and it's pro Georgia. And on behalf of my brothers and sisters and our families, I beg you to do the right thing for the people of Georgia. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Breedlow. It's 14 minutes, 20 seconds. Kim Jones. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, committee, I appreciate the time to hear both sides today. I am Kim Jones, Executive Director of NAMI, Georgia. I am a member of the Behavior Health Reform and Innovation Commission that brought this bill forward, representing the advocates, and I'm also the mother of a child with the mental health condition. I want to thank you for the number of hours and time and attacks that you took to represent this bill and to work on this bill. We know that it was a lot of hard work for each and every one of you, and we appreciate all of that time and effort that you took in looking at this bill and perfecting it. I'm saying this not so much for you as the Senate committee, but for others in the room, so that they understand and are informed that the Behavior Health Reform and Innovation Commission was started by the governor with both the House and the Senate approval in 2019. There are 24 experts that sit on that commission, many of which, over half of which, come from the private sector. There were five committees attached to that Behavior Health Reform and Innovation Commission. Many of them meeting monthly and having public held meetings that everyone in this room could have, should have, and I invite to in the future participate in. And that's where they define the problems and found solutions for the problems that you see before you today. I just wanted to make sure that everyone in the room knew that this is not something that you guys or that the House came up with overnight. It comes after a year, two years, three years worth of work of spending hours looking into this issue on Behavior Health to see what we can do best for the people here in Georgia. Also, to all of those here I've offered many times to meet with the leaders of the people opposed to this bill, many times this year, many times last year to know a veil. And I am still here willing to work with anybody who truly wants to improve Behavior Health. With that, I thank you for your favorable consideration of this bill and for all that you're doing. Thank you. We have 12 minutes left. Heather Breeden. Good afternoon, Chairman Watson and members of the committee. I'm Heather Breeden. I am the paid lobbyist for the National MS Society here in Georgia and the Carolinas. The committee members, many times have heard me talk about what MS is and how it affects someone's nervous system, their brain, their spinal cord, and the implications of that. Today, I want to thank the committee for their hard work. We are pleased to be part of the Georgia Mental Health Policy Partnership with NAMI and with my friend Jeff Breeden at the Georgia Council on Recovery. We ask that a strong version of HP 520 come out of this committee. I have asked some committee members that step therapy be put back in. We also need a study of workforce. I encourage you to continue looking at those loan forgiveness provisions. We know that it's critical to having an adequate number of providers in our state. Once again, I thank the Senate for their hard work on this bill and we look forward to seeing it move forward. Thank you. There's 11 minutes, one second left. Darleen Lynch and then Dr. Isard. Thank you, committee. My name is Darleen Lynch. I'm from the Center for Victims of Torture. We have been a long time member of the Georgia Mental Health Policy Partnership and I'm proud to stand with our colleagues who spoke in earlier today in support of this bill and to recognize the hard work that you've all put into it. I do want to flag a couple of things. As Kim Jones pointed out, this bill is the result of many, many hours of work over a year, over years, by many different people, myself included. One thing we did over that time was educate the Behavioral Health Reform Commission about Georgia's changing population. Today, one in ten Georgians is foreign-born, that number is going up. 500,000 of those folks are eligible voters but who have trouble accessing mental health care without cultural and linguistic responsive approaches. We were thrilled to see the data collection and the licensure provisions that were starting to carve a path forward to building a stronger workforce that could meet the needs of all Georgians. So I would suggest, I would hope, that you would revisit section two that removed the workforce study that would have assessed, what are those cultural competencies in our existing workforce and are they sufficient for Georgia? I would also suggest looking at section 11 that removed a licensure study that would have come up with some innovative approaches to bringing new trained clinicians into the workforce, including those who trained overseas. So thank you very much. I appreciate all that you've done and I hope you will consider those suggestions. Thank you. We're at 9 minutes, 10 seconds. Dr. Isard and then Callan Wells and Ruth Naomi. I'll be quick chairman. Great afternoon to our esteemed legislators. I know this has been a long day for you all but I am Dr. LeCliccia Isard. I am a resident of Newton County, Georgia and I am a licensed professional counselor. I have served in the mental health counseling field here in the great state of Georgia for close to 20 years, in settings such as our community service boards, as well as our Georgia prison system. I also serve on the board of directors for the national lines of mental illness here and I come today just to thank you for your diligence and your hard work and already what you've done as it relates to HB520 and I would like to ask you to continue to move forward with HB520 with sincere gratitude and looking forward to it passing our great legislation. Thank you. Thank you. We're at 8 minutes, 18 seconds. Callan Wells, Ruth Naomi's in the shoot and Elizabeth aptly after that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We are here to talk about children's issues in this bill. My name's Callan Wells. I'm with Gears, the Georgia Early Education Alliance for Ready Students. And I'm Pauli McKinney, advocacy director of Voices for Georgia's Children. HB520 recognizes the important role that parents and other caregivers play in their children's health. There are several provisions in HB520 that support family and parent involvement in their children's mental health care. Parents, caregivers and families can and should be included in their children's mental health care and HB520 supports this premise. Unfortunately, children experience traumatic events and have mental health challenges. We know that mental health clinicians who are licensed by the state of Georgia and their professional boards can help support children and their families when it's necessary. These services save lives. Thank you and I'll be brief as well. You have a couple of fact sheets in your folders, I believe. And I'm speaking as an employee of Voices for Georgia's Children, but also as a mom of children who have wrestled with mental health issues as well, who thank goodness did find help and are doing quite well now. Suicide was the third leading cause of death for children ages 5 to 17 in 2021. In 2022, 73,000 students reported having seriously considered harming themselves in grade 6 through 12 on the student survey that goes through all public schools in Georgia and almost 44,000 reported actually having harmed themselves. The number of children in Georgia who visit emergency rooms for reasons related to suicide nearly tripled between 2008 and 2021. And then just to pile on one more statistic, approximately 70% of youth in the Department of Juvenile Justice long term facilities have a mental health diagnosis severe enough to require ongoing treatment. And if that doesn't illustrate why we need to beef up our workforce and to help our kids have the most the best potential for a great life, I don't know what does. So I want to thank you for your work all of you on this legislation and know that we are in full support. Thank you. We're at six minutes and one second Ruth Naomi and Elizabeth Applier last two. My name is Ruth Naomi. I just want to first thank you all for this platform and this opportunity. I'm a certified peer specialist for adult mental health forensic peer mentor at Georgia Regional Hospital Insecator. I provide peer mentor services to forensics as well as adult mental health in the hospital and in the community as I myself am a peer. But I am also a wife, a mother, a friend, a geo-su-panther and before anything I appear. What this means to me is that I'm a person who improves in success and long-term recovery. I'm an over-comer living with mental health triumphs. I have been in and out of mental health facilities and Georgia State prison systems. But with the strength, hope and support resources that Georgia and the health field has provided alongside with family things and peers, we have stood alongside of me to empower me, our universe for self-advocacy, living in a self-directed life. I can return to those experiences, to the facilities, places and streets where I've been through and instill the same hope and extend a supportive hand to share mind-lived experience, fight through the fears of overcome and recovery together, empower connective peers to prosper through past choices, and build a toolbox for a healthy mind, spirit and soul. Employment, education, housing, and most important recovery. I stand here as a testimony of a peer support membership in eradicating the barriers of any percentages or statistics or visitivism and recovery. I believe that together we all can break down barriers, here we cover for giving growth. Together we can win no matter what. I am no longer a statistic, but a proven success rate. But leaving together that we can choose to build an empire of hope and make a difference for all that share a legacy here in Georgia. I want to ask you today, I don't know if anyone here familiarizes with it, takes a village to raise a family. But I want to ask you, what do you do when a community is ill-equipped to do so? As a person in long-term recovery, we empower, we educate, and bring awareness to the community, to the tools and resources that are keeping our families and communities in most important, our future generations safe, out of jails, out of hospitals and away from drugs. Please, I urge you to make a stance on House Bill 520 and be the change by Georgia needs. The stakes are way too high. We have already lost so many to a community that is not equipped to bring forth a change that we need to turn the ship up right to stand with us, but live recovery every day out loud and are igniting the fire in others to believe that hope in a community makes recovery possible. Why do we need you today? I heard Senator Jones in her prayer. She said that she was praying for those who walk alone. That impacted me and I know she heard me saying, man, because it hit me in my soul. I looked to my family and one day the door was shut on me. I looked to people that thought they knew what mental health recovery was. It was important for me to get the right medication, to be in a hospital setting, to be in a place where I could sit down and see when understood what I was going through. Because of that, today, I walk alone. I walk empowered and I stand up for those. I stand up for those that when they walked alone to know that they are no longer alone, a number we all have risk for recovery. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Naomi. Two minutes, 28 seconds. Elizabeth Aplie. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is Elizabeth Aplie. I'm here representing Presbyterians for a better Georgia. The Georgia Academy for Marriage and Family Therapy, the Georgia Supportive Housing Association and the Price Community Partners and Georgia Advancing Communities together. I would add that personally, I have been a student and attorney and advocate for those struggling with disabilities to increase access to mental health care and to health care for over 50 years. I want to thank this committee. We support the legislation and the hours and years of hard work that went into crafting this, seeking to address barriers to mental health workforce so that we can address the needs of Georgians who are in despair, who are desperate, and whose lives are at risk for lack of access to mental health care services. And we appreciate your efforts to address the particular challenges of those people with mental illness who are homeless, who are cycling through the criminal justice system, the emergency rooms, and the hospitals. Their need for housing, for supportive housing, for mental health care is incredibly important and we appreciate your efforts to address these issues in the legislation. We support the bill. We want to continue to work with you, to listen to you and to listen to the voices of the advocates seeking to increase access to care in Georgia. Thank you. Thank you. We had 49 seconds to spare. I won't recognize a center, a settler. You wanted to talk earlier and the floor is yours. I just wanted to speak to this. This is the time of the committee. We're going to have committee member comments. I want to share my perspective on this, Mr. Chairman. First of all, I want to thank everybody who's been involved. There's a spectrum of positions and opinions in the slides. I happen to be sort of fall more on the side of a constitutionalist. I think that every bill we look at, we need a approach from the perspective of how are our founding fathers, their review of order and liberty, how they look at something like this. How does a proposition uphold every person being an image bearer? Right? An image bearer of God. You approach things that way. Let's kind of look at things. First of all, thanks for the folks who came here to speak against the bill, for the bill folks that read this bill and had concerns about it and raised concerns because I've raised a number of concerns. That's why I'd like to thank the chairman and others for listening to a lot of those. That's really what the genesis of my talk, the things that I've asked for to be changed from that 100-page bill that got us down to 725 pages. So, where we stand in 2010, and this may sound a little partisan to some, but in 2010, we did have a mental health issue in this state. I mean, just being planned about the Obama Justice Department, with Eric Holder, the Attorney General, got their Sunk Thirtieth into Georgia and said, you got to fix your mental health issues. Anybody on both sides of the question in 2010 would recognize we had issues. Now, those teeth are still in Georgia. You know, through 2017, there was an administration change. The Trump Justice Department was in place for four years and still had their teeth in Georgia because we didn't fix our stuff. We're sent by citizens to come down here and run government that works. That's accountable. We talked about a billion dollars or more that's spent by agencies. The public expects the agencies not to work like Keystone cops and not be able to talk and work with each other. I mean, everyone recognizes, even if you want small government, government's supposed to do its job and not be dysfunctional. What this bill's been largely whittled down, is making the agencies work together in a way that the public would expect that we should anyway. We've got to get our act together if we want to get the Justice Department's teeth out of Georgia. And I believe power should be in the states and then with local governments and people, not the feds. Right now, we are being dictated by the feds. The Biden Justice Department has their teeth in the state of Georgia and they're calling the shots. And until we can get out from underneath it, they're going to continue to call the shots. So what's left in this bill is largely to get the Justice Department's teeth out of Georgia so we can go and be a state that's got, that runs its affairs. We've got, again, we talked about the billion dollars of agency spending, you would expect agencies to run things well and not be dysfunctional and can't even talk to each other and use the same language. That's what this bill really is left to do. I treasure the criticism. I've invited and appreciated all the folks that hate HB-20 or 520 sending emails. I took a lot of that stuff and talked to folks, did some homework and I went to the chair and there's four things that I asked for. And Chairman Watson and Vice-Chair Patrick and others that worked on this listened and gave me the four things I asked for. Now, there may be other people that have different opinions on this. The first thing I raised a concern on, which I thought was the biggest thing of all. Now, I got emails about other stuff. But the things I had the biggest concern about was the civil liberty issue of involuntary civil committal. Now, we've got a process today that if people file affidavits and you can get committed against your will, that's existing law. That's an ugly thing, but there's a place for that in where it circumstances. What the original version of 520 that came out of the house said, it made changes and maybe they're more subtle than others, but essentially it made it where people could be civil committal committed and the people who filed the affidavit, their names would be redacted. It created a little bit of a shift towards, yeah, I've made it affidavit to have someone committed and my name can be veiled. It's this idea of sort of being able to sort of have some secrecy to be able to have some commit. That's out of the bill. That was that was something I asked the chair to chair. Listen, there's a process today. The process is fine. Let's just take that out of this bill and they did it. So thank you. That was to me the biggest liberty issue in the bill was that it was even a tweak to the process of civil committal. That's been taken out of the bill. So if you came today because you didn't like HP 520 because of that, the process worked. You were engaged, you were heard. That's out of the bill. Second thing, I had big concerns with this issue of serious mental health, the definition not being set by the legislature and being delegated to organizations to work together and come up with the definition. It's not what we do. I mean, the senator's not and we're in the shall business. The general assembly determines things and sets law. We don't delegate to other people to set law. That was an issue. It was structurally wrong. It shouldn't have been in the bill. It's complicated. What we've done, though, and the direction of the chair and vice chair is that we've taken that out. What we've said is agencies work together, do your job, figure out what a good definition is, come back and recommend something to us by the end of the year. And we, the general assembly, will be the general assembly. We will act to definition if we need to, but the lawmakers will make the law. We're not going to delegate that. So if you came down today because you hated that in 520, thank you for being involved. That's been changed. I'd like to thank the chair for that. Third thing I asked for was data sharing. I thought the data sharing that came across in 520 was too loose. We can talk about intentions. I don't describe wrong intentions to people, but it was I think too ill-defined and too expansive. I'd like to thank the vice chair and the chair and the others. Rain that in, brought that down. So what we've got now is we've really limited the data sharing to non-personal information. And it makes the agencies work together like they need to. So they're not keystone cops and wasting the billion dollars we give them. Okay? Fix that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And fourth thing, wouldn't a huge thing, am I? But I've heard other people say it was this loan forgiveness thing. That's been narrowed down some. But we've got, we have a need for mental health in all parts of the state. Now I would ask you this. I would not, as much as I love George and I love to live in the country someday, I would not be willing to take my family and move to any part of the state that someone, if you know, draw a, draw a county out of the state so you're going to move there, same pay, same jobs, same everything. You're going to move there against your will. You're going to go live there and do your job. You got to have inducements to induce some folks to live some places. Now if I can live on Representative Goop, Senator Goopman's farm, I'd go do it. But I'd love to be a farmer. But everybody who provides medical services will not live in any part of the state without some inducements. The loan forgiveness induces trained doctors, trained medical providers to live in parts of the state they would not otherwise. It's an important part of this bill. It's not a giveaway. It's not a boondoggle. I'm a rapper. I know Senator Orack's point into her watch. I appreciate my friend. I'm speaking to people that had major problems with this bill who were like-minded. The issues I have with this bill have been fixed. I'd like to thank the chair. Read the version that came out. I know you guys have a chance to read this. Read it. And the things that I was concerned about were many of your concerns. They've been fixed. Read the bill. Appreciate you guys being here. Thanks for standing for liberty. Take a look at this. Thank you. Thank you Senator. Appreciate that. Thanks so much. And I mean we got the latest was today. So we have other questions from the committee. That's where we are. Senator Orack. Thank you so much. This I think has been time well spent invaluable to walk through this bill. I did not hear an explanation of why the step therapy was struck a struck in the Senate version because those of us in the health policy have long understood that particularly with mental health drugs, mental illness drugs, that moving from drug to drug and failing on a drug before you are eligible to get the drug that your doctor is recommending. I think the vice chair- My chair can answer that. I was just going to say there were a lot of concerns coming from a lot of different angles on this. One, how is it going to mess up the step therapy program that we passed in the law? I forget how many years ago, maybe three years ago. It also had the same definition problem that we've been talking about the whole time about the serious mental illness defined by the department of the department in this case being the department of insurance. And I don't I've got all the concerns in a pile in my folder here that I can share with you later. But we thought that section needed some work and decided that that would be better to work on over the summer. Well I think I can put some attention to it and possibly get it. You know get it we get a common ground between the House and Senate on that because it has such a negative effect when it's when it's the insurance industry. Thanks Senator. Thank you so much. You questions only you might it's not flashing up here so if we have any raised hands or questions happy to do that. All right vice chair does. This is this is not a question this is just something that I wanted to share that the chief justice of the Supreme Court shared with us in his day that judiciary a couple weeks ago. And this these numbers really took me by surprise and I just want to be sure everybody knew that in Georgia one out of every 33 Georgians is incarcerated. One out of 13 Georgians is under if they're not in carcerate they're under some sort of correctional supervision and 25% of those people have mental health issues and that is why our justice department our judicial system is begging for help in figuring out best practices and ways to get the people that are in the correctional system evaluated and assessed and out of the cycle that they're in. And so that was kind of the thought process on the whole familiar faces and chief justice bogs had a lot to do with developing some of the language in that bill. Senator Jackson. Thank you Mr. Chairman. I think you mentioned this briefly in your overview but can you help me understand why we've taken out the session the section that really dealt with coming up with other ways to make sure that people who come with experience from another country perhaps and licensed why that was taken out because it's still in there but it made sure that the numbers are like it's everything moves so much it's hard to numbers are different yeah so can you show me where that still is so I know there is for people who are coming from state to state that's in lines well really is in the next to the this in the last page and next to last page it starts with the against workforce no I was wrong different section I was pointing to I was wondering why I couldn't put my hands on it

Lines 435, 436, 437. I don't know if you're going to be the line number. 435, 436, 437. And so with that include I'm particularly, I represent an extraordinarily diverse district in which many of the people who I serve are foreign-born. And so with this include coming up with measures to make sure that if someone say we're trained in another country that they would be able to have access to licensure here as well, would this be included here? That's the intent, is the board would make that decision. But that's the intent of the language. The board would be able to look at someone licenced elsewhere inside of that would qualify to have a license in Georgia. That's my understanding. I think the previous version of the bill, we had some more clear language. But I'll keep looking. Thank you. You know the questions from the committee? Senator Warren. Thank you. Senator, Mr. Chairman for indulging me. Just briefly, we didn't delve into the housing. That was struck and understanding that there'd be such a component of stability versus instability for people struggling with mental illness. And we heard some testimony about that. That was one of those. It was voluminous. It was frankly very difficult to tackle. And we can circle back on that in the future. But right now, I think this is a little bit too much for this bill where we were. And that's sort of where we were with that. You know the questions from the committee. All right. If not, thank you very much for your patience. We still have Representative Newton's Bill House Bill 343, and Lauren Richardson Drug and the Colors for Patient Act. Is Representative Newton still here? He is. As he walks in the side stage, stage right. Representative Newton, as you make your way to the podium, why don't we give like a couple minutes just before you start. So we can just give a little transition here. I don't want to. I'll have a little transition here if you don't mind. All right. Let's come back to order. We're sure appreciate everybody's patience. I know that Representative Newton does appreciate the patience. And we're at House Bill 343, LC33, 94, 67S. It has not changed since we last heard it. And we have some things in your folder that are part of the paper clip. And we have people to testify also. Representative Newton, the floor is yours. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. It's an honor to be with you today. Thank you for your commitment to health care. Thank you for giving my bill a chance to be heard. I know you've done some thorough work and I look forward to working together further. Just a real quick. I know this is the second hearing we've had on House Bill 343, which is lowering prescription prices for patients. It I'll go real quick over what the bill does. It did pass last year unanimously in the House and then again this year. We are looking forward to working with you on it. Very simply what the bill does, it saves patients money on their needed prescriptions or medications that their doctor prescribes. It does this by making those more affordable by allowing the price calculated to be calculated after the rebate or discount. We did discuss this together in the first hearing on the legislation how PBMs are pharmacy benefit managers negotiate discounts with the pharmaceutical makers and negotiate those discounts in the form of rebates that are then sent to the PBM. Unfortunately, oftentimes the PBM keeps much, much are all of that rebate rather than passing the discount or the benefit of the discount through to the patient. House Bill 343 accomplishes a goal of affordability for the patient. Does this by requiring that insurer or PBM, which is the one who tells the dispensing pharmacy how much money to collect from the patient, that out of pocket cost at the point of sale, that PBM we require them to, when they calculate the price, that they tell the dispensing pharmacy to collect from the patient that they reduce the patients out of pocket cost share and accounting for a minimum of 50% of the rebate or the discount that's received by that PBM or insurer. It's pretty straightforward bill from that point of view. This bill has been in various iterations. I know the chairman had a bill that used 80% as a target for how much of the rebate would be passed through to the patient. This is a very modest bill. I think it's a cautious step to improve affordability for patients by being cautious not having 80 or 100%, but only a minimum of 50% passed through to the patient. Once again, it does exclude a risk of plans which are governed, which are exclusively under federal regulation. Also out of an abundance of caution, it allows for some end of the year reporting and transparency to the Department of Insurance. It allows a careful review of any effect on premiums or potential effect on premiums. So real quick, I want to tell you what you're probably here or what I've heard on what the opponents are saying and why I think you should look carefully at this. You're going to hear from insurance companies and their PBMs. You possibly might hear from some businesses that typically would never like mandates of any sort. This would be a mandate that this benefit be included in an insurance plan in Georgia. Certainly the most aggressive opponents are lobbyists and special interests working for large insurers and the PBM companies that either own or own by the PBMs. Just a reminder, the top three PBMs control 80% of the drug choices that all Americans have. Three PBMs do that. You're probably going to hear from some of them. One example is CareMark CVS Etna. That's a combination that all has a common ownership. We don't have any problem with most people don't have any problem with the company making a reasonable profit. As a matter of fact, the Affordable Care Act, the ACA, actually baked in profit for an insurance company at about 15% for profit and overhead. It required a medical loss ratio or 85% of the money actually be spent on health care, whether it's prescriptions, medical services, hospital services or whatever. So there's a guaranteed profit margin in an insurance company. As I mentioned, CareMark CVS and Etna are all owned by the same common ownership. Once again, Etna gets a guaranteed profit through the ACA of approximately 15%. There's also 9800 CVS stores approximately around the country. But those three entities, there's more profit that comes from the PBM than from both the guaranteed insurance profit and the 9800 CVS stores together. And I've never been one to be against a company making a profit. Usually that's a way to prove that you're bringing some value, maybe some innovation, new products, things like that. What we do have is when a corporate desire for excess profits starts to harm patients. I think that's when we as legislators ought to step in and protect patients. So you've got these highly profitable corporations. You'll hear from some very skilled lobbyists in town, out of town. They certainly is a very highly profitable industry, so you'll hear from them. You'll hear a couple of things. They'll make the premiums go up. Or this only helps some patients while making a lot of people pay more for their premiums. Well, they are partially correct, but in my opinion in a very confusing way. Realistically, every insurance benefit, every insurance benefit causes everybody to pay a little bit more. Maybe several dollars a month. And while only helping a few that might need that precipice of benefit in a particular year, leaves aside the fact that premiums seem to go up even without the benefit we're talking about now. But naturally when some new and say new and better joint replacements come into play, or a new minimally invasive, devinci-surgery is offered procedure or chemotherapy treatment that's groundbreaking. All those advances may cause everybody's premiums to rise a little bit, but only a small minority will ever need those. The comfort is knowing that we are a family member who's faced with that situation, and we have insurance. We know that the insurance will cover it. It's frankly, it's why we have insurance. Even though we know that any particular thing, be it prescription drug benefit or anything else, is pretty rare for any of us or our families to need. But we have the comfort of knowing because we have insurance that if I need a joint replacement, I can get it. If I need expensive medication for my child, it will be available and affordable. On the premium increase thing that I said that the PBMs will probably accuse this bill of causing, once again they're right, but I think they're a little bit confusing in this too. The insurers probably won't tell you that multiple studies and physical note calculations estimate that this premium increase for HB343 is likely to be 65 to 75 cents a month for a member. We voted on biomarkers not long ago. That was estimated at a dollar a month, increase in premiums. So they're right when they say it will increase premiums. They will. It will. 65 to 75 cents a month. They're right when they say it only helps a few while making everybody pay a little bit more. That's the nature of insurance. One other group that has said that it prevents us from selling a legal product that our customers want. That also goes into the second group that I've said that kind of opposes this bill or at least appears to now is that sort of along the line that small businesses don't want any mandates. They don't want a mandate to cover making prescriptions more affordable for patients either. Now if I be, I see a sign up to talk on this. They never spoke against the bill in two hearings in the House or on the House floor. They did try to kill the bill quietly on crossover day. I know that never happens in the Senate, but it does sometimes happen on the House side. Unfortunately, unsuccessful. So we have a chance to get a hearing before this. I have tried numerous times to meet with and review with their executive director and their board individuals and they've all been declined for the last two weeks since that. I was kind of puzzled why too. Arkansas apparently just signed into law, I believe yesterday or day before a bill that passes 100% of the rebate benefit to the patient. Passed the House, passed the Senate and now has actually been signed by the governor. I look over there and there was no evidence that small business opposed it in Arkansas. I don't think we're really that different. And if I be, never took a position or spoke against it, a stronger version of this. I'm not sure why there's an effort to say small business won't like that. If we had had a chance to meet, well, I do know. I do expect the insurance industry to be against this. It is taking what some might consider excess profit and giving the benefit to the patient. So I can understand why someone in the insurance business and I believe we'll find out that some of the people within FIB are associated with the insurance industry also. But if we admit though, I think we could have talked a little bit more on why this bill is actually a win for small and medium businesses and I'll explain. The bill has two parts. The first part does help the patient by giving them the benefit of the pass through of the rebate. It lowers their cost at their cost share at the time of purchase. But there's some end of the year transparency requiring to the Department of Insurance. And what this will actually do is the Department of Insurance who oversee a lot of these policies that small and medium businesses have, not like the Arissa plans that large businesses have. Those large businesses like Coca-Cola, UPS and state health benefits actually have the bandwidth to insist on transparency. And for the first time, we're going to have some transparency that's available through the Department of Insurance, all carefully protected from trade secrets and all. But it'll be carefully protected. But small businesses will actually have the opportunity to get the same benefit that large companies, SHBP, a lot of our insurance, insurance is through them. They'll actually have some of this. We never got a chance to talk about that because we never had a chance to meet together with their board and some of their decision-makers. So I look forward to continuing that discussion. I will say small business groups like NFIB have always said that we don't support any new mandates. And that's, I think that's probably consistent. But in Georgia we have numerous state and mandates. And all of them, frankly, slightly increased cost. Some much more than the bill we're talking about today. So even though it might be cheaper, you can't sell a policy in Georgia with no annual mammogram coverage. You're just not allowed to do it. It might be cheaper. Half the people don't use it, maybe more. You can't sell a policy with a preexisting, preexisting condition exclusion. We just don't allow that to be sold in Georgia. I actually have a list, the Department of Insurance sent me of several pages of all the mandates that we think are important so that when someone purchases insurance, they actually get what they think they're paying for. And when they're sick, they don't all of a sudden find out they don't have the coverage, as I mentioned. Remember, I talked briefly about the three different studies study design that expect the premium increase to be 65 to 75 cents, one set around 90 cents, but under a dollar a month. But then patients will know, just like they know now when they have different surgery or medical treatments that are needed, they'll know that they are their loved ones, can access medication therapy that their doctor prescribes and that they'll be able to do it affordably. Several years ago, this body and our health committee across the way, we had a problem called surprise billing. It seemed to be an intractable problem with tremendous challenges. You had large health systems and hospitals on one side, yet even larger insurance companies on the other side. And we looked around and who was getting crushed, it was the patients. It took several years. Matter of fact, I've been here seven years now. I think that was going on when I first came seven years ago. All right, we're going to wrap this up. Sure. Please. We did finally come together and fixed surprise billing. I think that's what we ought to do today to make the prescriptions affordable. We've worked on this for years. This is not a rush through bill. So just where we are is that we do have a quorum and we're going to change this from hearing only. We're going to have a vote. And I just want to make sure that's okay with you. And if there's anything else you need to add. If you don't mind, we did make sure this is. I think we have an opportunity. I know Senator Jackson referenced the gift of life in her opening prayer for here. I do think we have a chance to, and you'll hear from some of some patients whose conditions really need the benefit of medications. If we can work together to make them more affordable, I'm confident that we can make a difference in their lives. I look forward to working with you on it and answering any questions. Thank you. Thank you, Chairman. The odds, I don't want to lose a quorum that we have. And if we're going to vote on this, we have to have a quorum. So we're going to do, we're going to do similar to what we did before. We're going to do those who oppose and those who are in favor. We're going to give each side 15 minutes. If you don't want to use up all the 15 minutes, I'm sure it wouldn't hurt anybody's feelings. But that's where we're going to do it. So 15 minutes for opposition. We have Jesse Weydington, Michael Powers on deck. Good afternoon. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, thank you. I'm Jesse Weydington. I'm the president and CEO of the George Association of Health Plans, which is the commercial trade group representing George's health insurance industry, as Chairman Newton described. We do have several issues with this bill. I'm here to tell you about some of them today. My members are in opposition. Just briefly, because you've had a long afternoon and heard a lot of information already today. The primary reason that our members are having an issue with this bill is that it's completely unnecessary. You can buy a point of sale rebate plan on the market in Georgia today, four out of our eight members offered those, or you can buy a more traditional plan where the gross amount of rebates is netted against the aggregate premiums. So everybody gets a little bit less out of pocket every month on their premium payment. And if you're a plan sponsor, you can purchase a plan like that right now. One of our members, the large national company, their 2500 national customers, 25 have chosen to do this. Several of them happen to be in West Virginia, which is the only state to date that's actually enacted this. I would call attention to the fiscal note from California that was presented in the previous hearing where this was heard, because it's really illustrative as to what the actual impact of this does. So ignore the top line number, but get down into the actual analysis. So the impact of a legislation like this is that of 13.9 million people in California who had been subject to this mandate, approximately 839,000 of them would have benefited from it. That's about the 15% odds, so percent of people that typically take a brand name prescription drug. And let's be clear, those are the people who would benefit from a point of sale rebate plan. The 13.9 million people who would be paying $200 million in increased premiums, 839,000 people would benefit to the tune of $70 million of rebates. That's what this bill is about. But again, it's not necessary because you can buy both of these products in the state today. I would suggest that the General Assembly would not pass a bill to help clutch manufacturers by mandating that car dealers only sell stick shifts, but that's what this amounts to. So the necessary, we would ask you to reject this, leave the market the way it is. If a plan sponsor wants to purchase a point of sale rebate plan, then you do so today. Thank you. Thank you. Michael Power and then we have 100 logins. Good afternoon, committee, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Sorry, excuse me. My name is Michael Power and I'm with the Farm and School Care Management Association. We are the National Trade Organization that represents PVMs. There are 70 PVMs that do operate across this country and there are new market entrants all the time. Recently, Mark Cuban and Amazon have decided to get into this business showing that competition does still exist in this space. We are here today respectfully opposed to House Bill 343 for a number of reasons that Mr. Weythington or restated. This is an option that our plans offer to plan sponsors today. Plan sponsors are those people that could be small employers, large employers. They are the entities with the state-owned benefit plan, paying a large portion of that plan. And so they have flexibility in their plan design today on how they choose to use those rebates. Our plan sponsors have access to rebate reports. They can get those annually, quarterly, however they see fit. Additionally, the ending provisions of this bill related to the reporting back to the Department of Insurance, Senate Bill 313 from 2022, Section 6 already created a rebate report that went into effect July 1st of last year. So we've already provided one round of rebate reports back to the department as well as two plan sponsors. The same report that the department gets, the plan sponsors get, and the next round of reports are due here pretty soon. So we already have a reporting requirement in place that provides this information to the state. So I'll yield my time because I appreciate your on-deck analogy and my son plays baseball at 530 in Cobb County. And I got to get over there. His bag is in my car. Thank you. You had better go. So, and then we have Alan Haines, his on-deck. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Hunter Loggins. I represent the National Federation of Independent Business here in Georgia. And we're here to voice our concerns on House Bill 343. In if I be, is a member driven organization with over 6,500 members and all of them independently owned and operated and almost all of them mom and pops with 10 or fewer employees. And after the exemptions in this bill for larger businesses in the risk program and the exemptions by all state employees, small businesses and individuals in the exchange or now the only ones that this will impact. While we appreciate Chairman Newton and what he's trying to do to address here, we understand that health care is an issue in the state. We don't believe this is the right way to go about it. And to address the comments made earlier, we in fact removed all of our opposition on crossover day in order to for this bill to move and open up a continued discussion with the sponsor, but that didn't happen before an attempt to have this bill on the very next day without it being on the agenda. Small businesses need relief from death by a thousand paper cuts, as we like to say. Supply chain issues, rampant inflation, labor shortages, and of course, rising premiums. We already know that this bill will raise premiums. We have seen the data from the bill sponsor on the study from California by the way who did not pass this bill. We know for a fact that the biggest problem facing small businesses behind rising premiums is finding qualified workers. And if our small businesses can't offer competitive benefits because of rising premiums, workers will go to the larger blockchains to find work. Small businesses could stop offering insurance altogether, and employees will be forced back to the exchange where rates will be even higher. As mentioned earlier, the point of sale option already exists. Our small business owners care about their employees. I don't know if a single small business who would not choose this option should an employee or multiple employees need it for relief. However, this bill wouldn't mandate a small group employer, use this option even if they have all healthy employees, thus the rebate going to waste and not being able to use the rebate to lower premiums for everyone. At the very least, please mandate the insurers offered this point of sale, but please don't take away other options. And don't take my word for it. I have with me our leadership council chairman, Michael Walker, who will be able to definitely speak to it a little bit better. Thank you so much. Mr. Loggins, we can go with Alan Hayes and then Ali Sarsak. Mr. Chairman, is Alan Hayes, can I have you on my time, Mr. Walker? Sure. That means we're not coming back to you. That's all right. Okay. Yes, I think. Yeah. Well, thank you. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I am the aforementioned Michael Walker and I'm the leadership chair of NFIB in Georgia. I'm also a licensed health insurance agent and broker, past president of the Georgia Association of Health Underwriters and a member of the National Board of Trustees. And if you have the opportunity to speak in opposition to House Bill 343, the first thing is the fact that with small business group insurance, it's community rated and it's based on the overall health of everybody in the group. And if you passed Bill 343, then those purple that are just the sickest of the small group, other ones that are going to get the benefit of the rebate at point of sale, the other members of the group will not realize any of the benefits in that. Also a lot of small businesses in order to be competitive with larger companies, they are paid for the entire group health plan. I have a colleague that has about 25 employees. He pays 100% of it. But he's also trying to make sure that there's a plan that's designed that will fit the entire group. If House Bill 343 passes, then that limits and restricts the flexibility of designing plans that will fit the overall group. In addition to that, the owner will not be able to use those benefits overall in order to lower the costs. In addition to that, it will also raise the premiums, as has been mentioned before. And every little bit helps with a small business in order to remain competitive and to be able to provide benefits to his employees so that they can attract and keep talented people. I won't belabor the point. I will just ask that you carefully consider the opposition and the reason being and ask that you vote against 343. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Walker. Alley Sarsak and Stacey Minsky. Probably maybe one of that baseball game. So neither one of those are here. So Mr. Haynes, did you want to say a word that cuts you off there? Okay. We got six minutes, 59 seconds, but if you don't want to take it all, we'll be. I'll go real quick. My name is Alan Hayes. I represent A. HIPP, which is the National Association of Health Insurance and just echo what Jesse and Michael Powers has said. I would like to add that I like to point out when I testify about pharmaceutical issues that usually what you're dealing with in your position is people's difficulty in affording drugs. And I'd like to remind people that the price of the drugs are set by the pharmaceutical companies. So big pharmacists, that's the price. If big pharma wanted to give rebates to individuals at the point of sale, they could do it today. You don't need a bill to do that. The rebates that are discussed in this bill are, I would say, more volume discounts. No individual would qualify them. They're usually aggregate for volume based on the whole plan and then they're paid later in maybe even the next plan year. So under that scenario, the way these are negotiating, the way they're in these contracts, no individual qualifies for it. So again, we would ask you to oppose this bill for that in the fact that again, in the California study that was pointed out that maybe only since it was not passed by the legislature in California because the physical note on it was $200 million for its constituents. Thank you. Thank you, NSO. Everybody, this signed up in opposition. So we got five minutes, 33 seconds left.

And we have, so, yeah, so Dorothy Leoni Glasser and Melissa Raeball. And then, Kayon Amami. Kayon, okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank you committee for today hearing our testimony. I am Dorothy Leoni Glasser. I am the executive director of the advocates for responsible care. We are a non-profit advocacy organization and we're urging you to pass. HB343. I'm also the lead on the Rx and Reach Georgia Coalition. We are a 42 member health-centered partner organization, including physicians, doctors, patient advocacy groups and patients who are working to expand affordable access to prescription drugs and treatment in Georgia. I'm a nurse specialist for over 40 years and a lupus patient with severe organ damage as well as a twice cancer survivor. I have focused all my work on voicing for the patients. I'm challenged by chronic illness and all of these patients today who are affected by this bill are challenged by severe chronic illness. I know they're plight and they're tired of navigating the circus of rebates that has been going on since 2019 when we tried to pass. This provision in the step therapy bill and it was omitted. So since then we came to an agreement. I also want to state that I refute most of the statements that have been made in that this will all charge an increase for premiums. We have not seen an increase in premiums because of anything like patient savings. We have never seen premiums balance out and not go up or go down because of a bill like HB343. In 2021 rebate discounts total $236 billion. So what happens is that the rebate had been created for patients by the pharmaceutical industry in order to ease the burden of these patient specific medications that patients for chronic illness must have. In order to live these drugs take them from wheelchair to walking from bed to working. So this bill is critical to all of these patients. The pharmaceutical benefit managers and the insurance companies get enough in profits to be able to sustain themselves without taking savings that were exactly created for the patient's benefit. We have provided this committee with an evidence-based data sheet that I hope you received. And we want you to know that they're critical in us having these rebates. The patients have been had private business hospitals and everyone else thrown at us that prevents us from getting the rebates that were intended for us. We have been voicing this appeal for four years and despite the scares that have been circulated we know from a CVS white paper. It states that reduction measures such as passing rebates to patients actually resulted in overall planned savings. And we know that patients can adhere to their medications if they can get their medications and afford them. These drugs are cutting edge drugs that patients need. Patients were first told that you cannot have 100% rebate and then we negotiated and compromised to 80%. At the beginning of March the insurers came to us and said no now we will not agree on 80%. We want 50%. Where does this end for the patient? Here we are today once again in good faith trying to compromise to just get the agreed and honored 50% that we were told we would have. Patient of being held hostage rather than getting the rebates that they need. So we turn to you our legislators urging you to pass three, four, three giving the patients the 50% point of sale rebate that was agreed on in all our negotiating. To keep them active and working and reducing their flares and improving their quality of life. We are just patients. We are not lobbyists. We are just patients lifting up their voices and asking you to please pass this bill. Insurers and PBMs are in this fight for their profits. Patients are in this fight to save our lives. Thank you. Melissa Raybold and Keon Amami. Hi. I'm Melissa Raybold. I am the vice. Sorry, I missed pronouncing your name. I'm not sure if anybody does it. I'm used to it. I'm the vice president of public policy for the Georgia Pharmacy Association. And we represent pharmacists and most of our members are community store owners, independent owners. And a lot of you have them in your districts. And what this bill does, I'm glad that Dorothy was up here because this is a patient bill. This is not a make money for the pharmacy bill or you know it might make money, it might not make money for the insurance. And that's what they look at. But you know we're not talking about patients getting the benefit that others haven't been talking about. But we're talking about the six subsidizing alleged premiums for the healthy by overcharging patients, copays and deductibles based on fake prices via denying patients the benefit of the discount. So this increases transparency and it lowers prices at the counter. And I thank Chairman Newton for bringing this bill because like Dorothy said, when you lower prices at the counter, it increases adherence. And I think that that helps patients take their medicine and it helps pharmacies with medication adherence and reconciliation. So we support this bill fully. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Rob all. And I'm mispronounced your name too. Can you help us with that? You said that the second time was perfect. Keon imami. All righty. Good to know. Thank you. And your testimony I think is actually in the. Yes, you should all have a copy of my testimony. Keon, thank you. My name is Boit Pettits next in Kim Jones. And we have eight minutes, 54 seconds. All right. My name is Keon imami. I grew up in Gwyneth County, I currently live in Marietta. During my first semester of college in 2014, I was diagnosed with relapsing, remitting multiple sclerosis. I had a 20 of 2015. I had my last relaps, thank God. I lost complete sensation, mobility and proprioception of my left arm. I went from dumbbell pressing 75 pounds in each hand to not being able to hold the paper clip or to tie my own shoes. MS is the number one non-traumatic cause of permanent disability for young adults. And thankfully, after months of intensive rehabilitation, I am now normal. I thrive. And I feel normal. And I want to continue to feel that way. I'm now pursuing my dream of becoming a neurologist to continue my fight against these diseases that affect so many people. And after turning 26, I became ineligible for my parents insurance, which my mother receives from her employer. I'm the general manager of my father's restaurant in Buckhead, Sufie's Kitchen. And like many Americans, I purchase a marketplace plan through the ACA Exchange. My fiance is a self-improved business owner. We expect to continue buying our health insurance from the exchange. We would rather pay a couple of cents more, a couple of dollars more on our premium than hundreds of dollars for medications. Okay? My ability to afford those medications to manage my disease has been imperative to my future success and my happiness. In fact, without these medications, my disease would likely evolve to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, a more severe form of the disease that can cause rapid development of disabilities. The rising cost of drugs and changing insurance coverage disproportionately affects people with MS. It causes delays in disruptions in their treatment and a study done by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, 40% of patients reported. Altering or stopping their treatment due to the cost. When people must make decisions between putting food on the table for their families, we are failing them. That is not okay. The reality is that insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers, many of whom are one in the same, make undisclosed agreements about drug pricing and rebate discounts. When Jalenia, my original disease modifying therapy, came onto the market, it costed $50,000. Today, it's $108,000 annually. A couple of those with the pharmacy benefit managers raising cost-sharing prescription drugs at this price, PBMs are profiting by making consumers overpay for those prescriptions. HB3P3 requires insurance plans to share the financial benefit of rebates and negotiated discounts directly to the consumer at the pharmacy counter or rebate at the point of sale. Also, the bill requires PBMs to annually report the aggregate amounts of rebates passed through to the insureds at the point of sale for the previous calendar year. This creates a nutrient-spawn and honest system. In patients who have these diseases, compliance is everything. For them to get these medications, it keeps them healthy. It keeps me healthy. It lets me be a productive member of society. That's important. I implore you to pass this bill. Require increased transparency for prescription drug benefit managers and ensure a portion of those rebates are shared with hardworking surgeons. Thank you for the opportunity to provide my testimony and to share what it's like to live with this condition. Thank you, Mr. Pettit. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Pharma was mentioned a few minutes ago. For almost 20 years now, I've had the pleasure of representing the pharmaceutical research manufacturers association of America here in Georgia. I want to say a real word of appreciation to Representative Newton for bringing this. We honor doctors and doctors, prescriptions and adherents to their plans. Anything that we can do as an association to see that those doctors and the adherents of patients, you've been hearing from patient and patient groups. We've got many members of Pharma here today, but what's most important are the patient groups and the fact that they're here today to tell you how important this is. It's kind of a drop in the bucket in terms of being able to return something to patients at the counter. We hope today on behalf of Pharma, but more importantly on behalf of the patients that you will evoke this out. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for changing this from hearing only to a vote today. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Pettit. Why don't we let Ms. Jones go and then we'll do questions. So, Kim Jones from NAMI recommends voting yes. All right, there we go. A question. I was going to ask Boy Pettit. It's been said that Pharma would benefit from these measures and from passing this bill. I've not been able to connect the dots on that. What would you say is a representative of Pharma? We have Zach Poss here who may be able to answer that question better than me, but I don't know that there's a benefit pharma other than the relationship with patients and again being an advocate on behalf of patient and patient groups. I know my pharmacist is in favor of this measure. Thank you. Appreciate your support. All right, got another question. Thank you very much. I think this actually may be for Mr. Hayes. Mr. Hayes, do you mind jumping back up? Thank you for returning to the podium. I just mentioned a $200 million number that was something from California. Can you just clear that up? What did that come from? How does that relate to this? During the House, debate in the House Committee over this bill, or the presentation made by the sponsor, he referenced a report released and he talked about it today from California. That California had a bill very similar to this that was moving through its process. He extrapolated from that report that this was only going to cost a couple cents per person. Yet California's fiscal note on that bill, California rejected the bill. They didn't pass it because if you add up all those pennies in California, it's $200 million. Okay, so since I'm not sure why there would be a fiscal note, I'm trying to understand that if the state health benefit plan Medicaid, Medicare, or other health benefits, we're talking about the term a new reference to the California bill. Yeah, understood, but I don't know why California is this going to be. That's apples and oranges, the way I'm reading this bill, if it excludes all the state-funded programs, then how's that relevant to it? It would be the cost of the NFI-B representatives testify, and the sponsor to testify. There will be cost increase if this bill passes. These rebates currently are taking in aggregate and distributed over the entire plan, and all members benefit from these rebates. Again, that's the way they're negotiated. These are rebates based generally on volume and are attributed to the plan. These are not rebates for individuals to get it. Many of the companies that provide coupons and other ways for individuals to get point of sale rebates. As I said, there's nothing preventing them today. Any big pharma company. I would urge you to compare what health insurance companies margins are to a pharma company. Any pharma company today could pass on rebates or just lower the price. I don't know if you read the paper today, but Moderna for COVID vaccine. Moderna is the government, which we paid to develop this. We paid $10 billion from Moderna to develop a vaccine. Thank you. I appreciate that. Chairman Satslick. I don't know who to ask this question, too. One of the folks that spoke that's opposed to the bill, Chairman Newton talked about this being a $60 cent to a month increase per person. I just want someone to, you know, I like to get clarity, but sometimes for you can get agreement. If there's somebody that's opposed to the bill, can they confirm that's a real number? And we're going to give Chairman Newton a few minutes to wrap it up. Yes, so Senator Satslick, to your question. One large carrier did rerun an analysis of this bill with a 50% rebate in it as presented today. There's a large carrier of all heart of them and one of the leaders in the market. It was a $12 per member per month increase as well as their projected this pass. No, again, I don't know that it changes my opinion, but I do think we ought to have some clarity on numbers. I'm not saying this caused me to drag my feet. I just want to, if we're arguing different sets of facts or different realities, I just want to get that on the table and maybe let the gentleman address that. Any other questions from the committee? Senator Jackson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I don't know who can answer this. It may have already been answered, but I had to be an ag. It seems to me that the problem is that the prices of these drugs are extraordinarily high. And I don't, I'm having a hard time understanding how this changes that. So what would prevent a drug company from just continuing to increase the price while offering a rebate? I'm just, I'm unclear about how this fixes the problem. Any other questions, and we can get them off their dance or that. Any other questions from the committee? All right. Dr. Newton. Yes, sir. Thank you. That is a good question, and I appreciate it. The two different things, your desire for facts. There are three studies. No one's really refuted it. You got to run it on your calculator real quick, but a $200 million cost for 13.9 million people comes out to $14 a year per person. It's about $1.19 a month if you did it per member per month. That was at a plan to pass 90% of the rebate through to everyone. We're down to 80, now down to 50. So the estimates, the studies estimates are now not $1.19 a month is what it might have been. So the agree with their statistic, they made it to sound like it's costing $200 million, but when you really look at it, the desire to help these patients who need it at $0.65, maybe $0.75 a month. And that's assuming you don't get what CVS themselves have said is a healthcare benefit, not on the pharmacy spending, but on the complication and lack of adherence to medicine. So you can actually lower premiums as what they propose in one of their own white papers. I think you answered the question. Senator Halburn has another question. Just a question. So small businesses for the most part are the ones that we're talking about here, right? Correct. And right now they have flexibility to use the rebates in one of multiple ways, correct? No, that's not correct. So we have the transparency that we have with state health benefits where we can hire a third party auditor and look at the $1 billion a year that's spent for the healthcare for $660,000 Georgians. We have that transparency available for a large plan. You don't have the transparency. There is no transparency report on how much of the rebate goes, but remember those profit numbers I told you about Etna and 9800 CVS stores and the PBM section makes more profit than those two put together. Making that profit and a lot of what they're making it off of is not passing it through to reduce premiums but passing it through to their shareholders, which normally I don't mind until it becomes excessive. And when excessive profit desire hurts patients, I think that's our obligation to step in at that point and defend the patient. Just to clarify though, if I'm a small business and I have rebates and they equalize my business, I'm not going to be able to do that. I think equal however many dollars based on my plan. Those dollars are what is being like booked against me as an employer, right? So I've got this many dollars in rebates and I'm now saying, okay, I'm applying these dollars towards either my premiums or I'm applying them towards pharmacy, point to sale or rebates or I'm applying them to a combination. So when I said before about flexibility, right now employers have the choice based on what they believe are the needs of their own employee based the most. Is that right? That's partially correct and thank you for that. I think the key thing about it though is that those one partner in this selling decision has all the data and you don't. Actually, if the hospital 343 passes with the reports to the Department of Insurance for the first time state regulated plans will actually have the benefit. They'll have the benefit of knowing the numbers that the large plans can insist on. It is not true that the employer of a small group gets a report on how much the rebates were and how much of them went to premium reduction. Remember much of it, vast majority of it went to profit for the PBM. You don't get access to that right now. That's one of the goals. One of the reasons I mentioned that small business should be in favor of this is because for the first time they'll have some of the ability to get transparency that you're describing. They'll have a chance to see exactly what those rebates are and whether or not there be in use to lower premiums or to go to some other entity. That's the reason we think this bill is a strong first step on two fronts. One to immediately help patients at least some a first step but secondly to give small employers the option, the information that they need that their large employers fill us to this thing too long. Chairman Walker, you got a question? Vice Senator Tube, you know what mine? Mr. Chairman. Yes. Did you? Senator Halmings. Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Node. Sorry, my back's to you. So we've worked on it. We did a PBM bill and Senate came through Senate insurance. I think it was in 2020 or 2021 to try to get to this issue of transparency which I fully support the transparency piece. What I do have concerns with is, is it not true that the state health benefit plan uses a PBM? Yes. All right. And is it not true that a lot of the larger corporations and ariths of plans use the PBM? Certainly. 80% of Americans are covered have their medicine choices dictated by PBMs who get the rebates. And are they using PBMs because it costs their members more in premium or they use a PBM because it saves the plan money? They have the plans you describe are actually correct. They actually can insist on seeing the, actually for a billion in medicine costs, there's 350 million in rebates. And they get to insist we, through state health benefits, get to insist to see that and see that it's passed through. I guess my point is, if it's saving money for the larger employers and the larger plans, why would you want to take that option away from the medium and small businesses? And we passed, if I don't, you don't mind, Mr. Chairman. We did pass a house bill out of insurance today for Senator Williams and all Williams where it will, it will bring down to, to 20 or more employees a requirement for the insurance companies to provide claim data, claim experience to even the smaller employers. Right now, they provide claim experience data for 100 and up. So the employer is getting the claims experience. Now they don't spell out necessarily what the rebate is but they know what the net drug cost is for their plans. So that is already being provided to the employer currently and they are able to then take that and make a decision how they want to structure a plan that they can afford and pay for and provide that benefit to their employees. If we keep restricting options and flexibility for small businesses, they're going to end up saying we can no longer afford to provide health benefits. We're just going to give a 50 cent of our raise and cancel our group plan altogether. That kind of thing, that's my concern with the bill. I think you are. He expressed his concern so I got it. Thank you. We have another question and then I will give you 30 seconds to wrap it up. My question is about the reporting because I can't remember who said it but somebody said that there's already reporting on this to the Department of Insurance and I'm trying to understand what the difference is between what we're asking and what's already required. This is a more robust reporting. It does allow special requirements to make sure that proprietary data that wants to be protected between the PBM and the rebate that's being paid that they can keep individual ones down. This one makes it more similar to what we do at the state health benefit level to where there's almost a third party confidential audit and you can actually see the total of rebates. You don't find about an individual drug or not but you can find the total of the rebates and those will be available to see to determine what the level of rebate is. Thank you. You're new and that's not part of your 30 seconds but it starts now. Well, I think we've heard several things. We've heard from patient groups. We've heard from large insurance companies. I do think we have an honest figure on 65 to 75 cents a month to give this benefit to patients who desperately need it. Just like requiring mammograms annually or other things, every benefit does have a cost. I recognize that. This one I think has the potential advantage to even lower cost by better medication adherents. I hope you'll help improve lives and possibly even save money or at the very worst 65 cents a month. I hope it's something you can support for these patients. You finished it right on time. They're 30 seconds. Good deal. Any further questions discussion? If not, would love to take a vote here. The proposal on the bill is for 50% level which would seem to me to be a fair place to start this. I'm encouraged by the fact that other states in the south are passing similar legislation. Thank you, Senator. Thank you. Anybody else with comments? It is chairman of insurance. I just want to make a motion at the appropriate time. Motion's appropriate is I make a motion do not pass. I didn't expect that one but that is what's on the floor. So no, we got a motion to do not pass and then we have a second. All right, so seeing that happen before and so we have discussion now. I like the motion to pass. That's the motion on the floor is do not pass. But I'm making a substitute motion. She can do this. All right. We'll go check with legal counsel and send a research. Substitute motion. Table takes the precedent. Yes, right. Okay, so that's I think Senator Settler is absolutely correct. I think legal counsel is we're going to have to do the substitute motion. She has motion to do pass and it's needed second on that and then we're going to vote on the motion correct. But this is do I vote? I think it's going to pass. So I want to make sure that's what I thought is that this vote is made clear with the committee. This vote is whether or not we're going to hear the amendment on her. This is not a vote on the bill. Now let's let's be clear on this. This is a not a vote on the bill. This is a vote on the substitute motion to accept your substitute motion. So let's make sure we're clear with the committee.

We're voting on. Senator Aright made a motion to do pass. Is a substitute motion to Chairman Walker. And so what we're going to do is we're voting on the motion. This is a not a vote on the bill. We'll be clear on that. OK. Do you have a discussion? I was of the impression that a substitute motion of do pass has the effect of final pass. Is that not the case? Because I think that's accurate. I don't want to add a judge. Yeah, I mean, it doesn't really. I don't want to get in all intense purposes. That would be the same. Because I don't want to get a procedural melee with each other on this. Yeah. We could vote the first one down. I think we have it that. I think that's I think that's that vote. Yeah. Right. OK. So let's be clear. This is a vote whether or not we're going to take up this motion to do pass. All those in favor of Senator Orrox motion raise your hand. That's six. Let's just make we're clear on that, right? Six. OK. Six, four, and all those against. Six to five. OK. So that's the motion to do pass. That is the motion that we hear. All right. So we had the motion that's on the floor is due pass. It has been seconded. And I'd like to hear if there's any further discussion. I'd like to be recognized for a motion at table. All right. So we have a motion to table. I'll second that. Yeah. So that's there's no discussion on that one. And is there a second to motion to table? There's a second to motion to table. Make sure we got a vote on that. OK. All right. So this is a motion to table. That's what's on the floor. And that's what we're voting on a motion to table. All those in favor of voting to table this raise your hand. Five. OK. And all those opposed to tableing it. One, two, three, four, five, six. OK. The motion fails. OK. So now we're in the posture of back to the motion on the floor is the motion to do pass. OK. Any further discussion on this? We already know we didn't. That's why you said it was six, five, two, three, four. No. So five. Not six. Five, six, five, six. Did I say? Yeah. I may have said it inappropriately, but I think everybody at the table knew that. I'm sorry. The motion to table failed five to six. OK. So now we're in the position of voting on the motion of do pass. May by Senator Oronk, second by Senator Setsler. Any further discussion? All those in favor of do pass. And we're on House Bill LC339467S. All those in favor raise your hand. Do pass. One, two, three, four, five. Five is do pass. OK. All those in favor, all those not in favor of do pass, raise your hand. One, two, three, four, five. Six. The motion fails. Well, I went back and forth on that one then. OK. So I think that that did not pass five to six. We're all clear on that. Correct. OK. All right. All right, Senator Setsler. At the end of the day, Senator, the bill still before us. The bill is still before us. The motion, the only motion that kills the bill permanently is the motion do not pass. That's correct. What's the chairs? Do we need is there a? What's so if we have another meeting, it could come back up. And that's going to be suspending the roles. Thank you. All righty. If there's no further businesses, the meeting adjourned. Thank you.
