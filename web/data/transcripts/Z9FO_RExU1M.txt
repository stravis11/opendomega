All members, please come to the floor.
All members, all members come to the floor, please.
The hour for convening having arrived, all members will please come to the floor and take
their seats, Mr. Clerk, will you ring the bell?
We're going to have the morning roll call, all members present will please vote green
to signify their presence in the chamber and Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machines.
have all members voted not quite but we're getting close all members we got you
Now, if all members voted, if so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machines?
Doorkeepers, will you please close the doors and keep them closed?
As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain,
which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain today is brought
to us by the gentleman from the 22nd House District, Representative Jordan Ridley, spoke
to Reverend Ben Day a few moments ago. I'm not going to ask you to stand now, but on
our mind, I know it is on all of our minds there about the tragedy that occurred in Washington
And last night, Pastor Day will have some thoughts.
And those folks and their families will be remembered in his prayer.
And we appreciate that.
Representative Ridley, if you'll come up and introduce our chaplain of the day.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I have Father Ben from Christ of his school church in Kineshaw.
Father Ben graduated from Seminary, from Emory University here in Atlanta. He's originally from
South Carolina. And before his time in Seminary, he actually worked in Capitol Hill in DC,
so he shared a lot of similarities with us here today. Father Ben, and it's time running
Christ of his school church has doubled the congregation size from 40 to 120
members if I'm correct and he's also the chaplain for the city of Kineshaw
police department and his ministry at the church helps those with abuse
substance abuse disorders and law enforcement and one thing about father all
of amazing accomplishments I think the one that's the most amazing is he
actually makes it really want to go to church on Sundays and with that father
Thank you very much.
Speaker Burns, Representative Ridley and Honourable Members of the Georgia House of Representatives,
it is my privilege to stand before you as your chaplain of the day and to bring you just
a quick and brief word about the concept of duty, that ancient and sometimes inconvenient
calling that rest is a mantle upon those who are called to lead as you are.
Before I began, as you heard, I confessed that yes in my 20s, I worked in political
management on several legislative staffs running campaigns across the Southeast.
And as should be obvious by the collar around my neck, I have now dedicated my life to
eternal repentance for those years in politics. But looking back on that season, I feel as though I
know a little something about what I'm going to say to you this morning. If there's one thing I
learned during my time, it is that public service for all of its noble intentions has a way of putting
you in situations that you never expected to encounter. Some of those situations are inspiring,
some frustrating and some wonder make you wonder if you accidentally signed up for reality TV rather
than elected office. But duty from a Judeo-Christian standpoint is not a burden upon you but as a gift
and a blessing, even if it lacks the shiny wrapping paper and bow. The duty of leadership,
particularly that of elected leadership, can often feel more like the prophet Jonah calling the
people of Nineveh. Unexpected and uncomfortable and prone to detours.
Jonah, as you may recall from the Hebrew scriptures, had a very clear instruction from God to go
to the people of Nineveh and to teach them a better way. Instead, he took a boat in the opposite
direction, only to end up in the belly of a fish, likely reconsidering his career options and
choices that put him there.
Legislators, I dare say that you may relate
to the story in ways big and small.
You have been called to serve and many of you
had a vision, a passion, and a deep love for your communities.
But duty often puts before you tasks that are difficult
and that you never really considered when you signed up
to run long committee meetings, difficult votes,
patiently waiting through the phone calls and emails from all hours and times from constituent to
let's just say are very passionate in their opinions. Maybe you wonder at times if you've
accidentally boarded the ship with Jonah at the Tarsius hoping for smooth sailing only to find yourself
in stormy waters and yet duty when embraced has a way of bringing transformation and miracles
not just in the lives of those who you serve,
but in your own hearts as well.
The Apostle Paul wrote to the people of Galatia,
let us not grow weary in doing what is right
for we will reap at harvest time if we do not give up.
Paul wrote this from a place of deep experience
through beatings, persecutions, and prisonments.
He surely knew that he was doing what is right,
but it was exhausting.
It was easier to do what was expedient, what was popular,
and what keeps the peace.
Yet duty calls us to something higher,
and in the end Paul could say with confidence,
I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race,
I have kept the faith.
Forfilling his duty to God was not easy,
nor was his path smooth, but he remained steadfast
in his calling, trusting that his labors were not in vain,
and his journey reminds us today that perseverance
in the face of hardship is not only worthwhile.
It is, in fact, holy and good.
Moses too, when leading the Israelites,
certainly had moments when he wanted to turn in
his resignation.
The people complained about the food,
questioned his leadership, and at one point,
even suggested they return to enslavement in Egypt.
apparently slavery with a side of onions and leeks
sounded better than freedom with a bit of uncertainty.
And yet Moses remained faithful to his calling,
even though it cost him purely.
Your duty here is not just the bills you pass
or the debates you win, but the people you serve
and lift up, the widow, the orphan, and the stranger,
and the protection you give to the God-given freedoms
and liberties of this land.
In fact, the Hebrew and Christian scriptures are quite clear
that the duty of leadership is not about power or authority,
but it is about service.
Jesus himself, the greatest leader I know of,
demonstrated this when he knelt to wash the feet
of his disciples, a task reserved
for only the lolliest of servants in the household.
If the Son of God could stoop so low to serve,
then surely we who are called to public office,
to public service, can find it without ourselves
to sermon the common good with humility,
wisdom, and grace, when duty calls us
to the work of governing.
So today as you take up the works
that before you may you find strength in knowing
that the duty you have been endowed with,
that often demanding is always worth the sacrifices
and the humility it demands,
for God truly blesses duty faithfully executed.
And if you ever feel like Jonah, just remember,
Nine of us turns out all right in the end.
So may God bless you in your service
and may wisdom and grace guide your every decision
for the remainder of this session.
Would you stand to pray with me?
Almighty God, you have blessed this land
and entrusted us with its care.
Help the people who always remember
your blessing to seek and to do your will. Bless our nation and our state with meaningful work,
wise education and virtuous behavior. Protect us from violence, division, pride and falsehood.
Defend our freedoms and bring unity to all the diverse peoples you have brought together.
Grant wisdom to those who govern so that they may seek justice, ensure peace, and lead with integrity.
In times of prosperity, fill our hearts with gratitude.
And in times of trouble, give the faith and strength for all of us to endure.
We ask all of this in the name of Jesus Christ.
And today, as we remember those who have been lost to the tragedy in the District of Columbia,
we ask a blessing upon all who are grieving, all who have been lost to life eternal,
and all who are working to preserve the common good and peace.
We ask a blessing upon those who grieve and mourn this day,
and we ask that we would remember them in our hearts
and be faithful to the work that has been set before us,
and we ask your mercy and grace and peace
upon all who are serving in the recovery efforts
even at this hour, in the name of Christ our Lord.
Amen.
Would you join me in the pledge?
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for the 10th Foundation.
I'm not going to do that.
The Bush flag.
You like to have that?
I don't go anywhere, I'm going to get things started.
The doorkeepers you may open the doors.
members you may join Father Ben in the south any room if you would like to greet
him and thank him for his message and get a photo with him. Thank you for that
message. We really really appreciate the thoughts and prayers that we all will
be offering up for that terrible tragedy. Thank you again and thanks for
pasturing. Representative Ridley's church and being so successful there in
community and your service to the police department as well. Thank you.

War. He served two terms in the Georgia House from 1967 to 1970. And three terms as the
chairman of the Calcutta County Board of Commissioners, including one as president of ACCG.
It was also on the Georgia Board of Industry and Trade, the inaugural Georgia World Congress
Center Authority, the inaugural State Quality Basic Education Initiative, and was in the

Aside from this extraordinary life of achievement, perhaps as greatest accomplishment was marrying
the love of his life.
His beautiful bride of 67 years, Miss Barbara Fallon.
Together they had three wonderful children, Leah, Bill, and Laura.
Leah joins us this morning in the gallery.
For 92 years, Billy lived a life of purpose, passion, and meaning through his commitment

Members, will you please excuse me, sir?

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
We rise today to honor the life of Bryce Johnson.
Bryce was the Tipton Judicial Circuit DA who passed away
on December 2, 2024.
Bryce was first elected DA in 2020,
and just last year he ran on a pose
and was about to start his second term.
Bryce was a loving husband to Erica
and proud father to wheel and son to Terry.
Bryce was a resident of Tifton,
but he grew up in Worc County,
and I can tell you Worc County was very proud of Bryce
and all his accomplishments.
Bryce was an example to all of us about integrity, leadership, and how to treat people.
He was hardworking, extremely bright, and most importantly, he had a great sense of humor
and I can tell you, that's a rare combination, but Bryce had it and a lot of you knew it
here.
Bryce loved politics, some have referred to Bryce as having an encyclopedic knowledge
of politics, especially Georgia politics.
Bryce would often come by the store and talk politics,
didn't matter what I'd work to do,
but we always love talking to Bryce.
We could spend hours talking politics,
and you know, that knowledge,
I could retain about 10% of what he knew,
so, as a matter of fact, Bryce knew more about
some of my elections than I recalls.
Bryce also loves sports.
He's a big work, County Rams fan,
love the braze, FSU, and I think Erica even taught him
and being a Georgia fan from time to time.
Bryce, as you all know, was involved
in the Republican leadership of Georgia.
He met many friends up here in this body
from that experience.
Bryce was really no stranger to the Capitol.
Just last year he attended judicial hearings
or an additional judge to the Tipton Judicial Circuit
and his attendance was very valued to me
and others in our district
that helped push that legislation through
and he was there for the bill signing as well.
You know, I wouldn't be surprised if Bryce
sitting up and having long political discussions
with former governors and even presidents
and I tell you, Bryce leaves a big hole
in Southwest Georgia and all over the state
And there's a free and I'm going to deeply miss Bryce.
And it's just something that I value his friendship forever.
I think I can speak on behalf of a lot of us up here
when we say we wouldn't be here without the encouragement
and political wisdom from our dear friend, Bryce Johnson.
If you'd allow me, I'd like to share with you
this resolution honoring the law at the memory
of Bryce Allen Johnson, whereas the state of Georgia
mourns the loss of one of its most distinguished citizens
with a passing of District Attorney Bryce Allen Johnson
on December 2, 2024, whereas Bryce Allen Johnson
was born on January 6, 1972 in Sylvester, Georgia.
I believe son of Donnie Lee Johnson and Terry Reigns
could.
Whereas Bryce Allen Johnson showed an infinity for politics
from a young age and his commitment to his beliefs,
as well as his ability to debate
the most divisive political topics
with respect and good humor
where inspirational to those around him.
And whereas in his adult life,
he served in various capacities
in local district and state republican organizations
as the Lister General for several towns
and as a district attorney
of the Tipton Judicial Circuit,
whereas outside of politics,
Bryce Johnson found joy in watching
his favorite teams play,
coaching his son sports endeavors
and serving as the professor to the Chick-fil-A Friday night football radio show.
Whereas a man of deep and abiding faith, Bryce Allen Johnson was an active member of the
first Methodist Church of Titton, where he served as president of the Church Council and
was a member of several committees.
And whereas he was united in love and marriage to his wife Erica Stribling Johnson and was
blessed with a remarkable child, William Allen Johnson.
whereas we will, he will be remembered for his encyclopedic knowledge of facts both important
and trivial.
Bryce Allen Johnson could always recite a team roster, a school's mascot, a county seat, or
even a school's most famous player.
And whereas a compassionate and generous man, Bryce Allen Johnson will long be remembered
for his love of family, friendship, and community, and will be missed by all who had the great
fortune of knowing him.
the family of Bryce Johnson, please stand.
And may we have a moment of silence
as we honor Bryce for a life well-lived
that will not seem to be forgotten.
Thank you.
Thank you, members.
And thank you all of the representatives.
A great remembrance.
Thank y'all for making the trip up
from South Georgia to be with us as a great day of remembrance.
And we appreciate Bryce's contributions to his family,
the community, and to this state.
Thank you all so much for being here.
God bless you all.

Representative McDonald and friends.
Miss Bigger, Lays and Jill in the House.
Last night, at approximately 2,100 hours, a tragic mid-air collision occurred just north
of runway 33 at Reagan International Airport.
American Airlines Flight 5342 and the United States Army UH-60 Blackhawk Helicopter.
As over 300 emergency responders arrived on the scene, they worked hard to see an effort
to rescue any survivors.
However, as time passed, their mission shifted from rescue to recovery.
Today I asked this General Assembly and all of Georgia to join me in praying for these
souls, lost this devastating incident, and for the families who now face unimaginable
grief. To those members of our assembly, including our speaker in Washington DC, we're grateful
for your safe return last night. Please be with all our nation's transportation partners
that move our loved ones around this globe. We pray for them as safety of its passengers
is paramount for their mission.
As I close,
as we also keep in our prayers the first responders
who have worked through the night in recovery effort,
their difficult task of identifying
and returning loved ones to their families is just beginning.
May we pause on a moment of silence as a body
and support of all these affected by this heartbreaking tragedy.
Thank you, Ms. Speaker, you're well.
Thank you, Representative, and members, I hope that you will not only with this moment
of silence in our prayers today, but prayers for these families in the days that come as
they deal with this tragic situation, tragic situation.

and everyone affected by cardiovascular disease.

hosted by State Representative Doreen Carter,
it'll be here at the Capitol at noon.
Go Red, I just wanna say a quick, in 2020,
I was standing here as we were doing the Go Red recognition
and all of the symptoms she kept saying,
I kept saying to one of my colleagues,
I got sent for those symptoms going on right now.
And we got back up, because we were in COVID,
I got back up there, and all of a sudden,
nurse, representative Viola Davis, started taking my blood,
she started checking my pulse, and she said something's wrong.
Then, representative Doreen gave me
and slipped something under my tongue.
I went down to the nurses station,
they're about to call the ambulance.
I actually drove myself to the hospital,
and they told me if I had not gotten me,
I would have stroked out.
So when we're telling symptoms here,
we're saving lives that we don't even know being saved.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I'll see you.
My be your own.

Thank you.
I rise on the sad occasion of what happened in Washington, D.C. area last night.
But those of you who don't know my background, I am a combat helicopter pilot in Vietnam.
I also served in a VIP unit in the Washington D.C. area where my unit flew VIPs around the
Washington D.C. area.
I flown into Reagan National a number of times.
I flown into Gullis a number of times,
Pentagon and so forth.
That area up there is when I, at least my co-pilot and I,
and other people flying choppers had to be on best alert
because it is a dangerous flying in that area.
So I don't know what happened last night,
But I know that anytime we lose anyone, especially in this case,
our military pilots, really we call ourselves aviators.
So I saw a lot of soldiers in Vietnam lose their lives in Champus when they were shot down
of other reasons.
So I didn't see that last night, this morning when I came in I looked at my cell phone
And that's the first thing popped up to me.
And it hit me like a turn of risk.
So I also were preyed for the families
of the military families and the families of the civilians
that was lost in that tragic situation.
