TRANSCRIPT
----------
you you so So if you please bow your heads. Lord, thank you for this beautiful day in Savannah. We ask that you bless these conversations and fellowship we'll have during this meeting. Lord, we just ask that the work we do, you will guide and you put your abundant blessings and support behind. We do all these things, your most holy name, amen. Amen. If you please rise and join me for the Pledge of Allegiance. Hi, Pledge of Allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Thank you. No George Flagler? No, you know what, they may not know it Senator, I appreciate it. But we do actually do a pledge to the Georgia flag in the Georgia State Senate. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank each and every one of you for being here today. We're going to go through a little bit of a process of doing quick introductions for people. We have a couple committee members that unfortunately could not be with us today through travel and unfortunately a loss of a family member. So we'll keep them in our prayers. Senator Beech's father passed away and he's the fear and so if you keep him and his family and your prayers, I would greatly appreciate that. Senate Resolution 275 was the culmination of a priority and initiative by Lieutenant Governor Bert Jones. Lieutenant Governor met with me earlier this year and talked about what his vision was and the work we needed to do and asked if I would work with him on that and I was glad to do so. So together we authored this resolution which passed through the Senate and then committee members were selected by the Lieutenant Governor's Office to serve. And this is the second of what will be six meetings for this committee. We are meeting all over the state. We are certainly excited to be here in Georgia's first city as it is a huge economic powerhouse and engine in all sorts of ways. And as we go around and do introductions the committee today, I'm very excited to have Senator Derek Malwell with us today. Last night we also had Senator Ben Watson, both who serve you extraordinarily well. Senator Watson and I actually came in together about 13 years ago when he was in the house of representatives and then he got a promotion up to the Senate. We're proud of him. Does well and former background, current background is being a doctor. And I want to take a minute to really brag on Senator Malwell as well who is newer to the Senate but has just came in done incredible work, has enormous respect and does just a great job supporting this area of the state. So we're very thrilled to have you here with us today Senator. Thank you so much for being here. This time we're gonna go around the table real quick and just do a very brief introduction. So you know who the committee members are and I'll ask Senator Halper to begin. I'm Senator. So Halper and I represent District of the United, which is in Atlanta. I'm from a neighborhood in Boston, city of the Atlanta, California, and so on. All of the building county, and the vice chair of the Senate, and I'm really glad to be part of this committee talking about these issues as they are the one thing and all of us here about this. Jason Asimeth, a proud state senator, who said in 2006, which is the mayor, whose parts of the full Senate County, discuss these Fried mix πaccballs. They said these screens. And happy good. 시간, Eden has the Me too. You keep addressing the problem. Show the reason he's percentages in those schools. Thank you very much, Adrian. Thank you, I'm a Federal Energy and Provincial Service, or Senior Vice President. I'm a Federal Energy and Provincial Service, or Senior Vice President, or a Federal Policy and Channel. All right. Great, Dozier. I'm Commissioner of the Technical College System of Georgia. Champ Bailey, Prof. Baha'i, Hall of Famer, College Football Hall of Famer, Philanthropist, Entrepreneur, Glad to be here. And by far the most popular person in this room. I'm just here to thank you for all the memories. Trip to us, and I work for the Savannah Economic Development Authority. I'm not on the committee, but we had to stay here because we're out of seats. Hey, I'm burnt brandly with the Savannah Area Chamber of Commerce. Senator Malu, you want to say a few words? I want to welcome you all to the second Senator Audistric, and John, you did exactly what I paid you for. I'm an excellent introduction, but I do want to take a little bit off because you forgot a couple things, so I'm going to take like 10 bucks off. Okay, fair enough. Thank you. We do have a couple of microphones here, so when we do speak, we've got this meeting will be recorded, and we'll make sure that it gets out to everyone. In a minute, I'm going to ask Lexi with our Senate Press Office to tell you about all the good things we're working on. We want this process to be extremely transparent and inclusive to everybody who has ideas and thoughts to bring to the table. We have a packed agenda today, so we've got those folks that are already scheduled to talk. We are not going to have time for outside folks to talk who are not on the agenda today. If you do want to speak at a future meeting, if you would please send a note to myself and specifically Haley, who leads our soon-to-be Senate research slash legislative analysis and policy group, we are going to continue to look at that and do our best to get as much speakers as possible. However, we want any Georgian who has a good idea to go onto this website and submit testimony written to us. We're going to get all of that disseminated to all the committee members, and as we go through the process of meeting and then pulling together a series of recommendations and a final report, we will take all of that into account. So please take some time, and if you didn't think of something today while you were talking, you can certainly follow that up through the website or through email, whatever your preferred method of communication happens to be. As we have speakers today, the one thing I'm going to ask is we're going to try and stay on time after we leave here. We've got another event we're going to be attending to. So in your speaking time, if you would really focus more on workforce, we know there's a lot of great things to celebrate, a lot of the good things about your organizations, but we really want to focus today more on workforce. With that, I'm going to ask Alexi, if you would mind coming over and giving us a very quick overview of the technology we have in place and the other things we've got set forth. Please. Good morning, everyone. Like Chairman Albers said, my name is Lexi Giuliani. I'm the interim director of the Georgia Senate Press Office. And so I wanted to give you all just a quick update. I know that at our last meeting, we announced the launch of our microsite for the study committee. So if you guys haven't had the chance to check it out, if you go to www.expandingjorgesworkforcestudy.com, that's a website that our office has put together in order to collect information about the committee, make sure that there's information out there to the public, we'll be updating all of the meeting locations on the meeting schedule as we go through. There's also a portal on this website where people can submit testimony directly to the committee. So this spreadsheet is something that we'll share with the committee as we start collecting testimony from people. I think we've had one person submit written testimony. So if you'd like a chance to do that, if you come to one of these meetings or don't have a chance to make it, and would like to submit comments, this is an excellent resource for you to be able to do so. We also have our video archives. So like I said, this meeting is being livestreamed to the Senate website, ledges.ga.gov. We're on the Senate schedule. We've got a couple of people watching. But once this meeting is concluded, we'll have an archive of the video here. So I just want to give you all a quick tour of how that works. There's a little drop down menu in the top left corner. All study committee recordings will live here. So if you ever want to go back and listen to comments that one of your colleagues offered, or if there was something particularly poignant that someone shared in a presentation, all of that will be available here. We're also working on making all of the presentations that people give during these meetings available. And so that will be available in news and documents. We've had some issues with our hosting site, but I think we've worked them out. So if anyone has any questions, let me know. My email is on the Senate website, and it's also down here on the bottom of the page on our microsite. And that concludes this morning's presentation. Thank you, Lexi. Great job. We appreciate everything you're doing. Lexi is part of a working group that assists this committee. And that's representative from obviously our press office, research, the Lieutenant Governor's office, our budget office, legislative counsel, and others. So we've got a great team of people who are working on this. And the last person I want to take a moment to recognize is most everybody in this room will know Miss Ali Farmer, who has really been the project manager quarterback of this study committee. And we're here to give a send-off and thank you, because Friday will be her last day with state government, and she has taken a wonderful position in government affairs with the PACE Academy. Is that right? PACE Center for Girls. PACE Center for Girls. So we're very excited for her. It's a bittersweet because she's done a phenomenal job working together with me for the last several years. But we're excited about her new position. So I say that, one, to thank Ali for extraordinary work. And number two, if you email Ali after Friday or call her, you probably will get a kickback from that number or email. We are working through the hiring process, and we'll have some updated contact information out right away. In the meantime, please feel free to email me directly if it's her presentations. Haley is spearheading that for us. And then certainly anything press will be lexied. All right, we're going to start getting into the meat of the presentation here. And I want to begin with somebody who's no stranger to any of us. We've known him in lots of different roles, and excited about his, well, I guess it's not so new position anymore. We're going to ask a bird if you come up and give us an update and hello from the chamber. All right, well, good morning. Thank you, Chairman, for that warm introduction. I'm going to give most of my time back to the folks who are going to present. The agenda is really strong, and you guys have really a lot to go over today. But I wanted to just tell you, I moved down here in February to take over as President CEO of the San Area Chamber of Commerce. And the reason I did that is because we are entering an exciting time here in our community. When you've been to city for 290 years, it's hard to say this is the most exciting time, or because a lot of stuff's happened over almost three centuries. But this is an incredibly interesting and engaging time right now for our community. Our ports, which you're going to hear, are growing like crazy. We've got a convention center that's doubling. You probably saw inside. You probably saw across the river. You guys heard from our tourism industry this morning about their workforce challenges. And then we've got an incredible manufacturing sector that has been very strong here for a number of years, but is about to even be stronger and play even more important role in our economy. And then in the logistics sector, as well, continues to be incredibly strong. So all that's very exciting. And there are a lot of folks here that are looking forward to that. But they're also concerned about what's going to happen from a workforce standpoint, from a housing standpoint, from a child care standpoint, all the things that come in transportation with this incredible growth. So what I would love to tell you today is that we're working on it. We're all working together, whether it's our education partners at the school system, the technical college, and our public and private institutions to our workforce development partners, or economic development partners, we're all pulling together and making sure that we're doing everything we can to help prepare our community for this incredible wave of growth that's coming. And so we're very excited about it. We're very excited that you guys are here and you recognize the challenge that is not just here, not just in Atlanta, but really all over the state. We're with record low unemployment, which is, again, great. And a great part, dude, that the policies that you guys have put in place, that creates these needs. And so it really demands that we take a really hard look at what our delivery systems are, what we can do better. And I would submit to you today, I think you're going to hear from a couple of folks here in our community that we are doing some non-traditional workforce development here as well. And I would just encourage this community to this committee to really look at that and see how we can expand those and enhance them and also maybe duplicate those in some areas of the state that may not have some of the same issues with military spouses, for example, or with our folks that are coming out and re-entering from our correctional facilities or our development disabled adults who can participate in our workforce. And so we've got all the above approach here. We're not, it's not a rifle, it's a shotgun. We're really trying to address this from every different angle that we can. We're really thrilled that you guys are here, thrilled to have this opportunity to really shepherd our community and to our community to a new era of growth and prosperity. And we need your help. We need your help. You guys have been very helpful to Savannah. We're probably be asking for more things as we come. But it's all towards making sure our community and our citizens have every opportunity to raise their quality of life, and be more involved in our community, be more engaged in their child's education, and then a better part of making us a really special place to live and work and grow. So again, thanks for being here. We'll seed my time back to the rest of the agenda. Really appreciate y'all's focus on this. So there's anything that we can do at the Savannah Chamber or any of our affiliated groups and partners, please let us know. Thanks for being here, and look forward to today's discussion. Thank you so much, Bert, for not just leading the chamber, but the incredible work you did for over two decades for the state of Georgia and all those many positions. We really appreciate it. Okay, next, I first want to thank Savannah Economic Development Authority, CEDA for hosting us in this beautiful room and building today. And I think we're going to hear from Trip first, and then also we're going to have from the joint development authority here in Savannah, Maria. So if you all would make your way up to the front, we would love to hear from you next. Good morning, everybody. Good morning. Thank y'all for being here. Mr. Chairman, thanks for selecting Savannah. I think this is y'all's second meeting. Glad that we're able to host. So today, as we all know, this issue is so critical to the state and of course our region. On April the 25th, 2022, Benji and Anna are here. I saw Anna somewhere. Okay, back there. Anna is with the Bryan County Development Authority, and Benji is with the Bullock County Development Authority. And then with Brent and Effingham County, on April the 25th, we found out we won the Hyundai Project, and we celebrated and went to bed late. So that's a fun story to tell. The next day we got out and went holy beep, where we would get all these workers. And so that's been a constant conversation in a lot of activity that's been going on since the project was awarded. And then of course on May 20th, 2022, the governor and company executive has made the announcement, but we have been working very hard on trying to address the workforce issues here locally. We did an assessment and then of course, Gulf Streams here and they're going to talk today as well. But we did an assessment based on what we think. We need to hire just in the manufacturing sector over the next eight years and it's pretty alarming. 18,000 jobs that we're going to have to fill. And that includes obviously Hyundai, their suppliers, the other manufacturing corporations in the community. And so it's a big lift and we decided the best thing to do was bring on somebody within the JDA that has a lot of workforce experience, HR experience in the manufacturing sector. So that person is Maria who's going to talk in just a moment. But we have been asking for so much stuff out of Atlanta that every time I would show up at the governor's office, the governor's role is eyes at me and what do you want now. And then of course, all of our local folks where we've been really put in a pickle as we've had a lot of great economic success in the region. But I think you'll be impressed with what Maria's doing and what we're trying to do locally as it relates to workforce. And maybe this could add to something as a whole with the state. I will tell you that what Maria's doing is fantastic. We're in the middle of a study that she's going to talk about, a workforce study, that several corporations in the JDA got together to fund. And again, taking kind of matters in our own hands. And the study will be ready in the middle of August or late August. But what I'm excited most about is that this study takes it even further. And what we're doing is with DCI, which is a public affairs kind of firm that does a lot of research, communications firm. And we're going to go out and target probably 10 to 15 different markets in the United States to recruit workers. And that's going to be a big plus for us. And that's what I'm looking forward to because we know we can't fill all these jobs within 60 miles of interstate 16 and 95. But I'm stealing some of Maria's thunder. So I apologize. But I think you'll enjoy what she's doing and what we're trying to accomplish. Any questions before I introduce Maria? Any questions to committee members? Again, thank you all for being here today. Sorry I couldn't make supper last night. But hopefully we'll have a good afternoon and when we tour the site. So Maria, please come forward. Thank you, Trip. Good morning, everyone. All right. Hang on just a second. All right. As Trip mentioned, I am, all right, let's see. I'm Maria Whitfield. I have been working in human resources for the past 27 years. But I have been working in this local area for the past 20 years in manufacturing as an HR director. I have worked at companies in chemical manufacturing basically to help startup companies. One of the companies I worked for in Liberty County was SNF Holding Company, which when I started had 200 employees and when I left, had 5,000 employees. So I have a little bit of experience building workforces. The second position after 10 years, I was hired to become the director of HR for DRT America. I was the very first employee hired. And it was very interesting because I was able to build a company from the ground up to include going to France multiple times to help to just learn the culture. Again, another chemical manufacturing company. A few years later, we purchased Pinnova Incorporated, which is down in Brunswick. And we were acquired by a larger company called Firmeneesh, which actually has 20,000 employees globally. So I did have a lot of access to tools within the chemical manufacturing field. Right before my son actually was playing basketball and I decided I wanted to move closer to the Savannah area. So I looked for a position that was closer and was able to start working for Norma Precision, which is an ammunition manufacturer located here in Chatham County, but was going to actually build a plant right across from the Hyundai site. So I knew firsthand what it felt like to fill the impact of Hyundai. So I'd like to tell you today just a little bit about what I've been working on. As Trip mentioned, we are working on a workforce study. So this is really the first order of business in my new role. And I would say I'm quarterbacking the study. This workforce study is local to the area. So Brian, Effingham, Chatham, and Bullock counties. It's being conducted by Wadley, Donovan, Gutschock, consulting, which we call WDGC. And many folks in the room have actually talked to them because they were a part of the workforce study. They are actually going to help us. And we hired them to complete a strategic, comprehensive workforce plan. So the study of course is designed to identify labor and supply challenges facing existing employers within the region. And of course, future employers in the region. All right. So the first thing that we did was actually do a market analysis. This was step one or task one of the workforce study. And this is to identify geographic parameters within the four county region, which is really basically within a one hour commute of the Hyundai site. And those 16 primary counties are listed, as you can see, a couple of them are in South Carolina. The second step of or the second part of step one was of course to define the market analysis. So we define the market's critical labor demands and supply shortfalls. We've identified stakeholders that have resources to efficiently address the needs and challenges and specifically the positive and negative market indicators of population statistics, workforce profiles, education, industry and occupational profiles, market wages, and of course, high school graduate pipeline. The second step of the workforce study was to define the immediate needs and challenges. And so this was actually kind of my first project. We created 93 questions in electronic form and actually had 26 companies volunteer to be a part of the focus group. Of those 26 companies, we had 22 companies that actually completed the workforce study and also completed one-on-one interviews with WDGC. We also decided that it wasn't fair for just those companies to be a part of the workforce study. So we sent out the workforce study to 140 companies within the region to include a few companies that were outside of the JDA, where we had 18 companies volunteer to take on the electronic survey. So in total, we had 40 companies complete the electronic survey. Some of the questions were related to, of course, workforce statistics, location, nature of business, pre-employment requirements, recruitment sources, training, of course, time off, engagement, and competitive demand outlook. The second part of task two was, of course, completing the round table sector interviews. And really, this took the longest. We actually had one-on-one interviews with some of our partners that are within the region, which would be staffing agencies, workforce development partners, high schools, higher education, transportation sector, economic development professionals outside the JDA, because we know the Hyundai effect is going to go beyond the local area. We also had political round tables by county and spoke to military groups to include spouse groups within the USO, or spouse groups, the USO, and also a group called hiring our heroes. Where are we at today? This is the current phase of the study, and as Trip mentioned, our workforce study should be completed sometime before the end of August. So task three is actually creating the workforce plan. So the scope, of course, is to combine tasks one and two, plus research into three other mega industrial projects outside the area that are similar in size to share best practices. And of course, when the study is complete, we will have a full definition of skill sets, demand, talent deficiencies, and of course, we'll also do a deep dive into the workforce development plan and share best practices. At this point, we will have the framework to execute the plan and we'll share with all of our stakeholders locally for buy-in. Again, as Trip mentioned, this should be toward the end of August. All right, task four is Trip mentioned. We also have a marketing company that is a partner of WDGCs, and they're actually what we would consider an external group, and they have worked with many companies around the world, Tourism, Economic Development Companies, Baton Rouge, Birmingham, Chattanooga, Cincinnati, and Colorado Springs to name a few. They're going to help us identify best-bip markets and marketing communication to help the JDA attract workers to this particular region. DCI, of course, will use tasks one and two to identify the best-bip markets to recruit from. And they will also use analytics and an attraction index to attract and identify locations. So in the end, the JDA will receive 6-A actionable marketing items and recommendation based on DCI's experience and, of course, data around their talent research. All right, next, so that's related to the workforce study. One of the things that I work on is, of course, working with existing industries. And I'd like to share just a little bit about that. So I am working with many companies around the region, existing industry primarily, to talk to them about how they can create recruiting efforts, very creative recruiting efforts, employing engagement and lots of retention tools. All right, workforce needs. This is the numbers that everybody has kind of been waiting for. So Hyundai will have 8,100 jobs and everybody knows and has seen that number. Hyundai also anticipates hiring 500 employees before the end of this year. The majority of those employees will be people from the US. I think it's important for everyone to know there seems to be a stigma within the community that they're only going to bring folks from their corporate office, and that's just not true. Right now, they have hired their technical talent and their startup teams, and many of them are Korean that are here in the area. However, they will be hiring the majority of the people from the US. In addition to that, to date, we have 5,000 new jobs announced from Tier 1 suppliers. I'd like to point out that not all suppliers are from this area, some are going to other areas. In addition to that, we know that there's a need for existing industries, for example, Gulf Stream just recently announced an expansion, and there's others that have announced expansions. So we know that, of course, the workforce is a major initiative and would like to share those numbers. So next, we have a snapshot of hiring needs. And again, this is estimates and projections, and I want to make sure that you guys are clear on that, specifically because it may have been flow, depending on demand, right? So right now, between 2023 and 2031, we will hire 17,750 people. That's the estimate and the projection. Now, while there's an immediate need for employees around the region, I'd like to point out that in a lot of cases, it's a nine-year ramp up. So those 17,000 people aren't needed tomorrow. We are going to basically divide them between now and 2031, and some companies will hire more, some companies will hire less. For example, one company's ramp up within the JDA is 87 employees this year, 260 and 2024, 130 and 2025, 130 and 2026. However, it also depends on the plan, and the plan being built, and making sure that they have all of the needs that they need to be able to hire the employees. All right, next. I'd like to share a little bit about what existing industries are telling me. So of course, as I mentioned, I'm currently working with many existing industries around the region. I've had about 50 workforce meetings with various companies around the region, and this is what I'm hearing. So what are you doing to keep your employees? They're offering more money and promotional opportunities. They're getting faster and response time to job applications. This is critical because they literally are all competing for talent. They're offering flexible working arrangements where I've never seen before, especially in manufacturing. They're offering professional development, quarterly bonuses, attendance bonuses, health and wellness programs, and I've even heard of a company that's offering flexible day where you choose the day that you would like to get paid, just to try to attract talent. Recently, I heard of a company building an on-site childcare facility and another company that's offering free childcare to all of their employees. Of course, free lunches. Some companies are building cafes and...

cafeteria is within their facility to help to just engage and retain talent. In addition to that, many are changing their weight times for benefits or compensation for not taking the benefits. For example, military folks, especially around the region. More recognition programs, of course, larger referral bonuses, wellness and mental health benefits, and of course, fun at work. I'm seeing lots of that, lots of competitions, lots of things that are going on within the community. So I thought that was very interesting to share. One of my other missions is, of course, youth workforce development. And one of my personal missions, because I've worked in manufacturing so long, is to help break the myth that trades in manufacturing jobs are dirty or dead in jobs. I know how much they pay. I know some of those jack trucks in the parking lot, and it's amazing to see some of, you know, 18 and 19-year-olds that are making $70,000 to $80,000 a year. So that's one of my missions. I've been working with all the CTAE professionals around the region to help them figure out how they can tap into this market and identify those students that should go straight to work. In addition to that, we've had job fairs, information sessions, career discussions, and next week we're actually taking all the CTAE professionals from around the region to the key of plant so that they can get a snapshot of what that looks like and what future jobs will look like. All right. And of course, the last part of my position is building connections. So of course, I am trying to make sure that I'm a resource for industry and of course connecting them in any way with resources around the region to include local technical colleges, military installations, various associations, staffing agencies, executive recruiters. There's even an AI company that recently came to me and talked about their new efforts and recruiting, which I think is very interesting. All right. Does anybody have any questions? Maria, thank you for that great presentation. Are there questions from our committee members? That was such a comprehensive presentation. I think you've proactively answered a lot of questions. I know we've already had some preliminary conversations, but I think it would be really important for us to continue to follow up with you for the important lessons you have already learned along the way, but also what you continue to see evolving throughout this process. So we as a state can make sure that we're doing our part of that job. Thank you to CEDA and the great work that you're doing with the joint development authority. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Next up, we will have Mark and Jay from Gulf Stream, one of our crown jewels here in the state of Georgia. Come on down, Jay. We'll look forward to hearing from you. Thank you for having us. Workforce development is top of mind at Gulf Stream these days to say the very least. And I want to walk you through some things that we've done here recently in some of the challenges that we're facing, high class problem that challenges we're facing with the current workforce needs that we have. So the topics I want to cover break down roughly into early career programs that we've supported, technical schools and some apprenticeship programs. Key theme through all of this really is we have to start with the kids early. If you're waiting till junior year, goodness sake, senior year, way too long. We need to be hitting these kids in junior high so that when they go into ninth grade, they have a plan. Plans can change, right? But they need to go into ninth grade, starting ninth grade with an idea and a plan. And to get that done, that's got to be a focus with teachers, with parents, educating them on opportunities, what's out there at the junior high level. And especially emphasizing or undoing the greatest disservice we've done to last several generations in that is telling the kids and the parents that if you don't go straight to high school, I'm sorry to college out of high school, then you're a failure. That's just not true. I could share lots of examples that we don't have time for on that front, but rest assured there are some excellent careers. There are people turning riches on airplanes that go upstream today making more money than I graduated and colleagues that graduate from Georgia Law School with are today. So take that home with you. A great was high school program. We are particularly proud of this program, Mark Bennett and Kyle Redner who would be here and have done tremendous work with that program. In short, the way it works, we partnered with the Chattam County, Savannah Chattam County school systems in Savannah Tech to create, again, an aviation pathway program that takes advantage of the dual enrollment opportunities that we have in Georgia. I want to emphasize that although it is an aviation pathway program, the skills that the kids are learning through this program are equally applicable to any advanced manufacturing jobs so they can go out of that program, walk straight to Hyundai and be very well equipped to do work there. The way their program works is we recruit out of eighth grade. Kids enter grades, they come from all over Chattam County. This program is set up to accommodate up to 75 students per grade and we just graduated our first cohort or a class, if you will, and hard to bend to Gulfstream. So the way it works in short is, again, we partnered with the Savannah Chattam County school system, Savannah Tech. We invested, we Gulfstream invested, well over a million dollars, half million dollars of that was to buy equipment for the labs so that the kids are training on the same equipment that they would work with at Gulfstream and other half being to support the program. Kids choose a sub pathway depending on what their particular interests are. There are two years there in Groves High School classrooms, Groves High School labs taught by Groves High School teachers. Last two years, junior and senior year, same classrooms, same labs, but now they're being taught by Savannah Tech professors and of course getting to do enrollment credit. So that's a, I think a great example of a business leading proactively into the workforce challenge in getting some real results out of it. We did a leadership program. This has been around since 2008, born by Gulfstream and as a mentorship program, a getting partnership with the Savannah Chattam County school system. When originally envisioned, the primary focus of the program was to get kids to stay in school. We had a bad retention problem. The Savannah Chattam County school system has tackled that and the focus has now shifted more tightly on educating kids on what their career opportunities are and then getting them to mentoring them to plan for how they're going to jump into that career opportunity immediately after graduation. We've invested about $10 million in this program since the beginning. Youth apprenticeships, we actually have two types of youth apprenticeships that I'll talk about. This one, internally referred to as just a high school apprenticeship program. We hire a junior and senior high school students to come in as apprentices in all parts of the company, from technical jobs to accounting to customer support you name it. We have about 100 students that are in this program. They get paid while they're working. During the school year, of course, they're working the afternoon and the summers. They work full time. They get exposure to working in a real business and exposure to things that they hopefully will like and choose that for their career. Span attack can't say enough about how great this relationship has been. It goes back to 1967 when it was going by a different name when we first opened up here in Georgia. The first 100 employees were of Gulfstream. We're trained by Savannah Tech's predecessor and in the sort of two primary categories of work that we do with Span attack are first in no particular order, but first the fantastic A&P school that Span attack has, airframe and power plant. That's the name for the FAA license to be able to work on our mechanical airplanes. We partnered with them since day one and again can't say enough about how quality operation that is. The other category are filling out skill sets on the primarily the manufacturing side. I won't read to you what's on the slide, but I give you one quick example. Building the cabinetry in a Gulfstream airplane or a high end yacht. That's a craftsmanship job. You don't hire somebody off the street and have them doing that work in a couple of weeks. That's a real craftsmanship job. A number of years ago we were having challenges finding people to come into that part of our business and that's a really important part of the business because customers kind of like things to be perfect to our airplanes and we want them to be happy that they're perfect. The way we partnered in that example with Span attack although we've done the same thing many times, we picked one of our master craftsmen in the cabinetry shop and then put him over at Span attack while still on our payroll to teach the classes and then to teach the teachers. That worked out, we've done the same thing with the poultry and a number of others. That worked out very, very well. The students loved it. They're talking to somebody who actually does it and we loved it because the class is however long the class is. Interview. You get to see work ethic and the like and of course the professors at Span attack love it because they're about in their own skill set. Just an example. With Span attack, again we put our money where I'm out there, we invested over five million with them and that's trust me that has been a fantastic investment. Return on invested capital there is fantastic. I mentioned we have two flavors of apprenticeships. The second one is more of a direct apprenticeship to a specific job program than the first one. The first one is exposure to Gulfstream, not necessarily or not as focused on the kids graduating out of the quote graduating out of that apprenticeship program to come to a specific job at Gulfstream. This program is very different. We bring kids in currently with the three categories you see here. Completion's paintings of painting in the Gulfstream airplane is harder than you might think. Pollstream and equipment technicians. A lot of a lot of for lack of a better term robots and the like in the manufacturing process and we need people to know how to work on those. That's what that means. With all three of these programs we bring, we identify kids, we bring them on the payroll and they're on our payroll while they're learning the job. Most of that they're in class at Span attack. Making classes, full time classes, we're paying for the classes if there's a charge for it. It's not part of the grant program. Then they come out with that basic skill set and they go into that job category and as they earn certificates in additional skill sets their pay goes up accordingly. They have a clear milestone path to say I'm starting at this pay rate but if I do X and then Y and Z my pay goes up and up and up and I've got a career in the Gulfstream beyond that. That's some of what we've been doing and what do we ask you to do is the committee or suggest that where we can put some resources. A lot of it is keep doing more of what we have been doing. The hope program, the hope grant program is fantastic. Our experience with the technical colleges has been fantastic but we just need more of it as the old saying goes. We remiss if I didn't mention our excellent relationships with Midterd Georgia State University which has a world class and I'm not exaggerating world class aviation program from pilots to mechanics to even air traffic controllers and then the engineering schools across the state. That's a little bit beyond this conversation so I'll just leave it to say we have, we think the states do a great job there. This slide last but not least where we've been recently in the challenges we're facing. Over 20,000 employees, system wide at Gulfstream over 13,000 of those in Georgia 1.2 billion in payroll in Georgia. We've added well over since in the last 18 months we've added, I'm sorry, these numbers below the hiring numbers, these are system wide about 60% of those will be Georgia just to apply the secret to Codering, the Rosetta Stone. Round numbers are the last 18 months, close to 3,000 hired, net new numbers in Georgia. The next 18 months, over 2,200 net new jobs is a target in the next 18 months. So a lot of work to do, appreciate your help, thank you for your time, entertain any questions Senator if we have time. Thank you Jay and appreciate all the work that you and Mark and the rest of the Gulfstream team not just does for creating jobs but the tremendous impact of the community here for so many decades. And I want to take a moment too to personally thank you for your additional service you do for the state of Georgia as a chairman of the Georgia Department of Economic Development which obviously is the main point of contact for us to woo and all these great jobs stay wide. So thank you for your service there. So questions from the committee members, questions from Senator Estevez. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Chairman. Thank you for having me. Thank you for having me. You have all the programs you have going on. How have you been able to, two questions, quick questions. Have you been able to tie how effective these programs have been to providing Gulfstream with employees long term. And then the second is how do you market these particular programs to the students? So the second category of a apprenticeship program that we talked about is the direct apprenticeship into a direct specific job that's brand new or relatively new just a few years old. The capture rate has been fantastic. I don't know the exact percentage. And I'll call it a lifeline to Mark or Kyle to answer the first, the other question because these are the guys who have the boots on the ground. Senator, on the recruitment, we partner. Senator on the recruitment, we partner with the Savannah Chanem County Public School System Effingham in Bryan County as well as our friends at TCSG. Savannah Tech, we typically recruit jointly at the high schools that way they'll see the Gulfstream job but realize how they can work with TCSG and Savannah Tech to access the hope career grants. So we work really well together. Question from Senator Halper? Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I also really focused on the apprenticeships that you're doing because I think it's just wonderful. My question is this. We know that there has been a real push towards getting kids to four-year colleges. I think apprenticeships and what you're doing here is a great way to introduce people to different career tracks and then employ them. You've spent a lot of money on this. I am wondering this question. Would you have, how many more students do you think you would have to participate in these programs if you had more, you know, if you had unlimited funds to actually invest in these? Would you find more kids who are willing to do them? I guess my question is really asking, are you seeing a difference from year to year to year in the growth of interest from students themselves in moving down this track versus what we have generally pushed as a more traditional track? Yeah. One comment that I'm going to call on Mark again to answer the question but the one comment I would make is we've had students come in through the high school apprenticeship program working in technical jobs that are technical jobs that don't need a college degree who have gone on and said, you know what, this is great but I want to be an engineer. And then we've had others that said, you know what, this is great. I don't want to go to college right now. I want to go do this. But then down the road, they do it at college. So a quick example, I won't give the whole story that the Goldstream has more business aviation maintenance technicians working for it than any other company on earth. The guy that runs all of our service centers, he has more business aviation maintenance technicians working for him than anybody on earth except his bosses of course. He's the product of a dual enrollment program came out. We got his A&P, went in work, turned the wrenches on airplanes for a number of years, then went back to college and now is at that position. So that's a story to tell, Mark, I'll defer to you for the rest. Yeah, we are seeing some big improvements in awareness. So Kyle just shared with me that of the 100 high school youth apprentice we hired, we had over 400 students apply for those jobs. So we are seeing movement there. I think the biggest opportunity we have is with our friends at TCSG. I want the kid in Southwest Georgia or Northwest Georgia to hear about aerospace opportunities in Savannah and Brunswick or in Atlanta. I want the kid in Southeast Georgia to hear about the incredible film and TV certificate they have in Atlanta. So I think the opportunities, how do we support our friends at TCSG to make certain every kid, especially in rural Georgia that might not be aware of these opportunities, how do we make certain they have access and awareness to these programs at TCSG? And hitting that awareness that no longer than the junior high level, so they've got time to do something about it. Are there questions, champ? I do. Great job, by the way. Kind of want to pick up on where the center started with the marketing aspect of it. How are you targeting these kids? Because you mentioned eighth grade. I mean, that's young, but I do believe you have to start young. How are you targeting these kids? And for my own sake, what's fuel in this growth? It's two part question. What's fuel in the growth in your company? In the company? I'll answer that question and turn to the expert market answer in the first part. So our business is moving. We've got, I think the short version is we've got the best workforce in the country in the world, I should say, do in this. We've got the best products because of the investment we've made, our parent company has made an R&D. Our products are at least half generation technology wise ahead of everybody else. And we have the best customer support organization in the world. Even our competitors don't argue with that. Our airplanes come out, high quality, all mechanical things break, but when they break, we're Johnny on the spot to take care of the airplane and get it right back in the air. That drives sales. We're taking market share from our, we're taking market share from our competitors every day. And in the business has been me 20, the last couple of years, it's been some of the strongest years in the company and our, literally our high class problem is we can't get the production right up fast enough to match the demand we're seeing. So that's the short answer. You build a good product with a good people or the right people and they will come. Mark, do you for the rest? Yeah, thank you. Our goal is to have every eighth grader come through the facility. We haven't hit 100% of that. There's just a lot of eighth graders. But anytime you come out to the plant, you will see a group of students touring the plant, seeing it, touching it, smelling what a facility looks like. That's the best way to create awareness. For those students outside of the area that may not get to come and kick the tires on an airplane, we have created a website and it's in various stages right now where a teacher in rural Georgia can download some airspace curriculum. We can even send them some, a little bit of swag to inspire those kids to consider airspace. So to Bert's comment, it's really a shotgun approach. We encourage our employees to go talk to their kids classroom even earlier than eighth grade. So it's a process that we can talk about. They call Kyle, a parent calls Kyle, we have swag. We send swag with the parent to the classroom to create that awareness. One of the cool things we should have brought, but we created baseball cards for the various jobs at Gulf Stream. So it hits some of the other questions around what is an engineer pay, how much do you have to put into a four-year degree, what does an opposed-ery technician make, and how much schooling do you acquire for that. So those baseball cards are creating a lot of energy, especially with the fourth, fifth, and sixth graders. So there's no magic bullet. We're just throwing everything we can at these kids to create some interest. We are seeing movement, especially the high school counselor's encouraging kids to look at technical education if it fits them. Mr. Chairman, I just have a quick statement. First and foremost, we have some incredible industries in this state, and Gulf Stream is one of them, and really appreciate Jay and Mark's partnership and really investment into the economic prosperity of each citizen in this state. They're doing that even beyond this area. They're reaching out into the coastal ponds area and starting up things in that area. But when you look at specifically the apprenticeships, as you were asking earlier, I just want to thank you guys and also the governor for the investment. For years, TCSG received some federal title one money that helps us with apprenticeships, the USDAOL apprenticeships, but in recent legislative cycles, this body and the governor provided the state funds in the amount of about 1.2 million to help with apprenticeships for industry to actually be paid to go into apprenticeships. So it's changing the mindset of those that haven't dipped their toes into it yet. And then the governor, through the grants that came down, gave an additional $4 million on top for additional training for those that are going into apprenticeships. So I believe we are changing that perception of apprenticeships, the perception of which pathways are out there and it's truly making a difference from the governor support industry supporting specifically y'all support in the appropriations process. So thank you. Thank you, Commissioner. Other questions for Jay or Mark? Seeing none, gentlemen, thank you again for your great work and service. Thank you for the opportunity. Okay, next from our George Port's authority, Lee and Stacey, you want to come on down? We always get to brag on all the wonderful activity and things coming through our ports and we're looking forward to hearing from you this morning. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, committee. My name is Stacey Watson. I'm the Director of Economic and Industrial Development for the George Port's authority. And I've been with the George Port for over 30 years. So I've been there to witness the incredible growth that we've had over that time period. We are actually the fastest growing port in the nation over the past 15 years and workforce from a commercial standpoint. If we're going to continue that growth, if we're going to continue to be a successful port. It's one of the most important aspects that actually feeds our growth at the George Port's. Won't get into all these numbers. I'm sure you've seen them before. But the economic impact of the George Port statewide is significant. And these are third party numbers that were done for us by the Terry College of Business, Go Dogs, 561,000 jobs and 3.3 billion in state and local taxes. So what I'm going to talk about for a minute is just the continued growth that we see, the continued investment that we're going to make into our port and relate that back to workforce development and job creation. All right. This particular slide shows us our world ranking in 2006 through the number 46 port in the world. So definitely a world class player as well as a national player. And as of calendar year 22, we are the number 27 port in the world. There are only three ports that are in the top 30 worldwide ports as far as container throughput, container throughput through our facilities. And it is New York, New Jersey, L.A. Long Beach and Savannah. So we are actually in a good company with those two gateways. We're actually growing our market share as well. Not only do we watch the number of containers that we move through our facilities, but what is that percentage and how is it growing according to our competitors, according to in comparison to other ports around the country. And you can see FY 14, we were 7.8% of all the market share of all U.S. ports. And today we're about 11.5%. So again, the fastest growing port in the nation over the past 15 years and we plan to grow. Right now our capacity at the Garden City Terminal is about 7 million T.E.U.s, 20 foot containers. And by the end of this year, we have a capacity of about 7.5 million containers. And we're doing just under 6 million 20 foot containers right now. So through all of these plans, you know, we've got ocean terminal, which we're converting to 100% container facility. We've got some additional property that we bought in Garden City to add to our Garden City Terminal capacity. We actually building a transload facility on the terminals. So we plan to take that capacity up to about 10 million T.E.U.s or 20 foot containers by our fiscal year, 2026. And that's an important number because as of today, New York, New Jersey, that port gateways doing about 9.5 million containers. The LA Long Beach facility separately, they're doing about 9.5 million containers on an annual basis. So we plan to grow and be into that class of terminal, that class of port authority, along with the top two. Actually that number three gateway. Okay. And again, this is just a repeat of what I just said, current capacity. Actually a little more than 6.5 million T.E.U.s by the end of 2026, 7.5, and by the end of fiscal year, 26, about 10 million T.E.U.s. This is our spend. This is the Georgia Port Authority spend as far as how we're going to increase that capacity. These are the costs right now with current spending, with our current budget under construction right now is about 1.8 billion dollars that we're investing into our facilities. Okay. Over the next 12 years, we're going to invest about 4.5 billion in our facilities. Outside the terminal gates, very important for us. Again, workforce, not just for the Georgia Port Authority, but for the entire logistics industry in the local area, very, very important. If a warehouse cannot staff their distribution center adequately, if they cannot have three shifts, if they can only have one shift, that affects their routing decisions. They may not put that freight, all the freight that they can through the Savannah Gateway. They may go to a Charleston or they may go to a Jacksonville, and then that threatens our standing as far as increasing our market share around the country. And outside the terminal gates, as you know, the warehouse industry is hot right now. We're actually seeing a lot of construction. There's actually a little over 40 million square feet that's under construction right now. And not only are we the fastest growing port over the last 15 years, but we're the fastest growing industrial...

market of our size over the past two to three years. So we're about a hundred and five hundred and ten million square foot market in the Savannah area. And again, there's more demand. It continues to grow. Vacancy has been fairly low over the past few years. We're seeing a slight rise in the vacancy of warehouse distribution center space outside the gate. Right now it's about 3.6 percent, but I can tell you with what I do on the economic development side, there is a lot in the pipeline. That's coming our way. This is a quick statistic on our import volume, our import containers and warehouse occupancy. And you can see it is a one to one correlation. So as the port grows, so does the need for warehouse distribution center space outside of our terminal gates. And that translates into more positions, more jobs that are going to be needed to fill those warehouses. So definitely a direct correlation. One of the things that I wanted to mention is that we've looked at some of the issues, especially on the warehouse distribution center side and what we need to address and how we need to grow. We've mentioned attracting kids, junior high school, elementary school, definitely a focus for us. And Leah's going to talk about that just after I speak, but we've also looked into what's called externships, actually working with parents, working with teachers, making them more aware of the logistics industry and the opportunities that exist for young people to get involved. We have to promote the logistics industry as a career, not just a job. Yes, you may start in a warehouse, but you can get into a forklift. You can become a supervisor. You can actually get an electronics degree on electronics deployment, work on the equipment. So that promotion of logistics as a career path, very, very important for us, as well as getting the parents involved and getting the actual local community and those teachers involved and helping us with that effort. So Leah, you had a few things to add? So several folks have mentioned some alternative ways of finding new employees. The Georgia Port Authority started a program a few years ago called the Yes program where we're hiring kids straight out of high school. They have to be 18 years old. And at 18, we have them for an entire year. We train them on how to operate a forklift, how to drive a truck on terminal. They get a mentor. They're taught all of the soft skills that we expect. We train them for an entire year. Today's Yes program employees. They start off at $21 an hour, full benefits. And then after about a year, they're set free to work on their own. They of course already have that mentorship relationship. And they get about a 50% bump on their hourly pay. And then of course, that doesn't include all the overtime that they're going to be getting as well. One of those participants started with us in the first class. His name is Jamel. He's currently a crane operator, making about $100,000 a year. He is 22 or 23 years old. His purchases on home has no student loan debt. And if he wants to go back to college, we have a tuition reimbursement program prepared for him. So trying to think outside the box, we have a longstanding tradition at the port of finding new ways to do things better. Stacy didn't mention this, but he actually started as an intern at the port of 331 years ago. So hiring outside the box and obviously it's paid off pretty well for us. So we have a lot of demand for our to operate our own facilities. So we're trying to find unique ways to bring in employees. But it's also our success is built upon our customers. And we've got to make sure in our community that we're able to find employees for folks that we're bringing in. And if they can't find employees to their warehouses or their manufacturing facilities, then that hurts us and our credibility as well. So what Y'all are doing is key to our success, our continued success. And so we just really appreciate you. Thank you. Stacy, we want to follow up on a question with you. You told me I'm promoting logistics, which I think is an excellent idea. And starting obviously in whatever position it is, I think we have to tell those stories. Just a few months ago we lost Oz Nelson, who actually relocated UPS two, Atlanta years ago. He's a good friend of mine, a fraternity brother. And I started washing trucks for UPS, right? And became the chairman and CEO of one of the largest companies on the planet. I think we have to tell those stories. So the story is about yourself, who started as an intern in the work that you do today. And I think it was brought up by Jay and Mark with Gulfstream. I think we even start younger than that. I think we need to bring third graders through more tours of the poor understanding. And I guess the question also comes to promoting, are you, even though I dislike a lot of what comes out of social media, are you doing any advertising or telling stories to target the young folks through social media and other means? Yes. We are, we've actually hired this last year a workforce development manager, Tonya Chisholm. And that is her job. And this is the job that we have never had at the port to work with the school systems, to work with our corporate communications team, to work with any stakeholder that may be able to help us attract employment within the Georgia Ports Authority. So yes, we look at all avenues as well. Yeah, you know, I know a lot of the younger folks, especially, you know, YouTube is one of their main sources of watching things. And I think we have to get some of the stories and excitement out there. Obviously, it's a treasure work that you all are doing with the ports and it's always exciting to see them ever growing. Are there questions from the committee members for either Stacey Orley? Yes. Danielle, please. I have a question. Yeah, CDL drivers is, you know, constant demand, you know, for not just our industry, but, you know, agricultural industry. So it's spread throughout the state, throughout several different sectors. We work real closely here locally, particularly with our local technical colleges, both here in Savannah and in Brunswick. Recently, we supported an initiative to get some funding to expand the CDL training with the Neffingham Inn in Chatham County. Understand that they've got the funding, so we're excited about that. But there's a constant demand for that. Nationally, there is a truck driver shortage. And so, you know, we've got to find a way to beat our peers at getting, you know, those folks in place and, you know, trade up. There are a number of other initiatives that kind of hurt some of some federal issues with allowing folks to drive across state lines. You know, we've heard, certainly, voice that in Washington with our delegation. Yep. And one of the things is lowering the age. I think the age for a CDL is 20 or 21. Drive across the state lines is 21. Yes. So someone comes straight out of high school and they want to be a truck driver. You miss the opportunity. They have to wait three years before they can drive their state. And with us being so close to St. of South Carolina, St. of Florida, there's a lot of demand for cargo to go from Savannah, certainly to those states and, you know, further inland as well. That's an excellent point. Haley, as we're continuing to take some copious notes on what will be future recommendations, I think we need to capture that as well as how we're going to continue. Not just what you're doing with the ports, but as a state to get to more messaging to our youth, I think that's important. One last thing that has been brought up a couple of times in discussions throughout this year has been, you know, during the pandemic, the younger age bracket of the baby boomers kind of retired in mass. So the time the stock market was high, inflation was low, life was seeming a little bit too short at that time. And we lost what was really probably the most experienced and certainly more the most accountable and responsible part of the workforce at one time. And a lot of those folks took Social Security early at 62. And what most of us know is if you take Social Security early, you will get penalized if you make more money than what the cap happens to be. And although we cannot control that as a state, hopefully through sway through our federal counterparts, I have asked them to try and look at suspending that for maybe the next five years for anybody who's great at early Social Security because we want and need them to come back to workforce with its full time or even part time, we could certainly use them. And I think with the markets, not quite what it was a couple years ago, and inflation has put a burden on many people, they probably need that opportunity to come back to work. Yes. Okay, other questions from the committee members. Thank you for your great presentation. I think, and we're going to continue to move on. We'll hear from the Georgia Restaurant Authority. Are we going to have Scott and Jamie come on down? While you're walking down here, one of our committee members, Ryan Perneese, who is a restaurant tour himself, unfortunately, could not make this committee meeting today, but I know he's going to be following up with us online and obviously has an active interest and works closely with the GRA. Morning. Thank you all for having us here today. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for having us out. You know, this is an important topic for the restaurant industry. I'm Scott Behrman, the VP of Government Affairs at Georgia Restaurant Association. And with me today is Jamie Dernes, he's sitting back next to the chairman. He's the managing partner of Daniel Reed Hospitality here in Savannah. I'm going to go a few data points regarding the industry and kind of from the workforce development items. We're working on as an association and then Jamie's going to come up and talk about some things, kind of an operator level. Our industry was hit hard during COVID. We lost a lot of great restaurants. Folks had to shut down. No, we are bouncing back, those. You can see here we have about 20,000 eating and drinking places in Georgia coming around over $30 billion in sales. Closer to 22,000, 23,000, but that's much. Just can bounce around a little bit based on openings and closing, just way the economy works out. In those 20,000 locations, we employ over 500,000 Georgians, which is about 10% of the total employment in the state. And this is an include, you know, includes obviously dishwashers and buskers and chefs and sous chefs, but also includes folks like food safety experts, food scientists, real state developers, marketing staff. The list is long. When Jamie gets up here, he can talk about some of the folks in his organization that wouldn't fit the traditional mold as you think of a restaurant employee and Ryan probably can do the same if you were here. The next slide here points out some of the breakdowns by congressional district. You can see obviously the fifth congressional district being downtown Atlanta having the highest concentration, but even here in Savannah, they're being quite a big number. You can see here how much is added to the economy. When folks have been money in restaurants, as you know, when things are being developed, you know, putting a new building developments, new town center type areas, they won't restaurants come in and serve as the foundation of those because those attract people in and adds money into the economy. A little bit of background about our workforce and our ownership. This is an interesting, these are a couple interesting numbers. I really want you guys to remember as we talk about this a little bit more. 80% of our restaurant owners and 90% of our managers started out in a tree level positions, like dishwasher, busers, greaders, just the first jobs. This is where they started out. So you can see a clear path here of folks coming into the industry, young, sticking around and making something of their own. I also want to point out here at the bond and the podium might be in the way. Across the country, the wage for a full service wage staff member is about $27 an hour. That's just the median number. I mean, we've seen folks make $50, $60 an hour at some of the finer dining establishments. You can make a really good living as a wage staff. And again, those are the paths that we see folks getting in, moving up to become owner's managers and things along the way. In Georgia, we're really proud of our diversity in the industry. 55% of our restaurants are minority owned, which puts us at number four in the nation. 31% are African-American owned, which puts us number two only to Mississippi. We are 46% of our restaurants are majority owned by women, which actually puts us tied at the top again with Mississippi and those numbers obviously fluctuate. We take the lead, they'll bound, they'll take the lead. So we go back and forth. But that 46%'s number compared to the nationwide average of 34%. We stand out above the rest of the country. Really quickly on a national level, and this kind of trickles down to the state, we are still seeing a staffing shortage. We're about 80,000 jobs short of where we were before COVID, and over a million job openings across the country. You know, some that will come down here. We're one of the bigger states when it comes to the restaurant industry. 62% of the operators. So here, 62% of the operators don't have enough staff. I'm sure you've all been in. You may have done it this week. You've walked into a restaurant and said, hey, there's an hour away, but you can see tables in the back. We hear from our restaurant tours across the state who go, we just don't have enough staff. We don't, we want to fill these tables. We want to have people in. We just don't have enough staff to do it. And 87% of those people say, if we can find good staff, we are going to hire more. We're going to add on to what we already have. We're going to bring all that. The Georgia Restaurant Association through our foundation and partnership with the Georgia or the National Restaurant Association found out the nation and we're trying to find a path to bring qualified folks into the industry. And we target high school folks through our pro-start program. It's a two year culinary arts program. It does a lot. It teaches kids about what the basis of being in a kitchen, what that's like. Go to some of the serve safe training. Hey, how do you get food? What's the safe way to handle food? How do you look out for unconscious bias? How do you prevent instances of sexual harassment in the workplace? Kids, things that these kids need to know. But we also teach them about professionalism. We talk to you about time management. Teach them about ways to come into an industry. Be it the restaurant industry or some other industry and take those principles across. We also go, you see a little bit more here of kind of what's been doing on. I think the serve safe is a big point there. We want our folks who go into the kitchens. We're very passionate about food safety. We want our kids to know when they go from high school into the kitchen. They know how to handle food safely. And so we drill that into them to make sure that they're going to come in prepared. We take it a step further and one thing that we really work on is a program called Fulton Connect. It's partnership through the Fulton Education Foundation and the United Way. It's a series of boot camps. So we're asking these kids to come on a Saturday. And so we're grabbing the kids who are really passionate about being in the industry. Again, we build on what they've learned on in the pro-start program in their day-to-day classroom. We talk about knife skills. We talk about how to prep a proper meal, things along those lines. But we go a little step further. We try to really grab onto those soft skills. We talk about showing up on time. How do you get your social security card? How do you fill out a tax form when you get there? How do you fill out a job application? These things that you're learning the technical side of being in a kitchen, which are also learning the things you need to be successful at career. Because we don't want our kids to do all this work, get a job, show up, day one, and they can't start because they can't fill out the paperwork. We want them to know exactly what they need to get into the classroom and get into the workforce right away. But I think the most important part of all of this is we talk to our high school students. It's just giving them the confidence and knowledge they need to step into the industry. I know the kitchen can be intimidating. It can be all the fire and the knives everywhere. It can be intimidating stepping in there. We want to give them the confidence that they can step in and know I belong in this place and I can step in. With 500,000 jobs across the state, we are a large industry, one of the biggest in the state. Ag is at the top, but we take their food. We take their product and we cook it up and give it to you. We have a place for these folks to come. And we want to point to them. We want to go back to the 80, 90% numbers. 80% owners, 90% managers have their start in the restaurant industry. This shows them you can make a good living and you can make something on your own through this industry and through what we can provide. So that's from a big picture area. I'm going to turn to Jamie to come up and talk about some of the local operator level stuff and then I'll close this out. How's everybody doing today? A little younger than, but don't count on that. So first, 22 and a half years of my life was spent in the farming. I grew up working for about an hour from here. So farming agriculture being the number one employment in the state that drives employment in the state. I've got a log experience on that side and the other 22 and a half years of my life have been the restaurant business. I want to just sort of touch on what the restaurant business is. I know there's a lot of emotional things that come up when you think about a restaurant, maybe anniversary or birthday or just having a wonderful night out with your friends. But to me, a restaurant is a manufacturing business. We are the largest manufacturing business in the state. We are the second largest employer in the state. So when you walk into the halls of our restaurant in the morning at the public at 8 o'clock in the morning, there was just boxes and boxes of raw material stacked up the ceiling. And it's incredible to watch the team come in and start putting away those things and making that work for us during the day. We bring in raw materials every morning. We break them down. We sell them for a profit. We start over the next day. So think about restaurants as a manufacturing business. On the agricultural side of it, having spent so many years of my life driving a mile an hour down at tobacco field or picking up dead chickens and chicken houses, we are an industry that is just tied to so many other things in the community. Farming obviously is very close to me. And I think that as a state, we've got to be very careful also about our rhetoric and the way that we attract other people to move to the state. It needs to be a welcoming state. We need people to move out of town. And we need farmers. In fact, my nephew just quit farming. He's 22 years old. And it's only one to be who is a farmer. But he had to actually sell of his farming equipment last year and go work at an HVAC company to make money because he cannot make a living as a farmer as a small farmer anymore. And a lot of that is tied to his tied to employment. If you live on a farm or you work in a restaurant or own a restaurant, which I never say I own a restaurant, they own me. Somebody asked me on my restaurant, so I don't want to say they own me. I never tell them how many. But things break constantly. And on the farm, you don't hire an electrician or a plumber or an HVAC person. You do it all yourself. I knew how to wire electric when I was seven years old, you know, as the soft skills I learned on a farm. But even when every ridge went out to go get a tractor tire fixed or something that he needed that he couldn't do, the parts weren't available because of drivers. And get the parts from the ports to, you know, to St. Petersburg. So it's a big problem all the way around. Lastly, I just want to sort of be the voice also for the small business. I mean, obviously ports, love it, Gulf Stream Plains, who doesn't love that? I guess I would ask anyone on the committee does anyone have any idea of what percent of small business in Georgia employing under less than 300 people? Does anybody know that statistic? So if you don't know that statistic, I think that's an important one to know. I would probably wager to say that if you look at businesses that are 300 or less, which is considered what some consider small business, I would probably say 95% or more of the state of Georgia small business. So while you're doing your work, trying to figure out how we're going to retain and get employees to move to our state, you also need to focus on the big things, but really you need to focus on the small things. How does an operator like me or a mom and pop restaurant bring talent to your restaurant and then retain it? I'll tell you that keeping up with a small business, if anybody here is owned a business, it's tough and it's hard work. And if you're a single operator or maybe have one or two locations in the restaurant business, you are pulled in so many different directions all the time. And I know that many of you probably know indeed, I'm not going to run out of time, I'll be quick here. But my partner was screaming at the TV the other day and I ran him and I'm like, what hell's going on in here? And he was so angry because indeed was talking about how to find that purpose off from home. We don't need to be sending messages to people to work from home, we need people out and our community is working. So that needs to be a huge message for the state of Georgia. I don't know if Georgia has a, I didn't look before I came and the fact that I don't know tells me that probably 99.9% of any future employee doesn't know. But Georgia needs a state run indeed that is free to all employers of the state of Georgia are free for all of the employees of the state of Georgia to use. It needs to be market, it needs to be known about, it needs to be robust. I'm spending $500 per week, per week now, to run one sponsored indeed ad at one of my restaurants. I'm spending $26,000 a year that's coming straight off the bottom line just to get people to come to the door. And even then you have to do that in several different capacities and keeping up with that as somebody that's working in the business as a self employed person is very, very, very taxing. And a lot of times we just miss the opportunities because we didn't have the time to do it. So my ask for you is to really get down to the nitty gritty and think about what really is going to work at the baseline level for everyone. So any questions or comments? Jamie, thank you and Scott as well. I couldn't agree more with you. Our small businesses are the lifeblood of our state. And while we do certainly love all of our large crown jewels as far as our big companies, we need to make sure we're giving the equal if not more attention to those that maybe don't have that large staff or a capital outlet to do things they need to do each and every day. And it's a real good point in working with economic development, certainly tying inter-technical colleges and universities. I think it's an excellent idea. Are there questions from the committee members for either of these gents? Good. Got a microphone right there? I actually like to make a comment. So certainly I love talking about airplanes. So Gulf Stream was awesome and you know talk about the ports, logistics is big and what we do. You had a point on your slide and you didn't comment on it but I noticed it and said 63% of folks work in a restaurant industry at some point in their lifetime. And I imagine that percentage is getting the less as time goes on. But you think you basically made the point that you said that's the training ground. And right now as we're higher in staff, I get people that Delta Airlines is their first job. And it's not a great experience honestly. It's an employer that breaks somebody in with, have to teach in professionalism and the soft skills and the customer service and the commitment and the work I think. So thank you for what you do and I think we'd all be better served if we found a way to encourage kids. Start a little earlier, right? And not get that first job after college but get that first job while you're still in high school. Right. And I don't know. I think we see a lot of our youth, the first job is in a restaurant where you know be a Chick-fil-A, be it their parents restaurant, be it one of the bigger brands. We see it as a perfect training ground. Maybe not perfect. I'll take that back. Well, it's a great training ground to learn some of those things. If you want people to come in and spend money in your restaurants and you want to continue to have folks come in, you need to be hospitable. You need to have people who have a smile on you. There's a reason that Chick-fil-A has high quality standards and have year after year, those customer surveys are always ranked high. And I think the industry is a whole, can model off of that. And a lot of them do. I think Jamie's folks do. And a lot of our restaurant tours, they take that to heart. You don't get into this industry to make a ton of money. The profit margins are not astronomical. You get in because you like to serve people. You like to be hospitable. And I think that's the common thread throughout our industry. And by showing that to our young folks who've come in, going either staying in the industry and moving the other industries, I think that's just apparent. And it can just something we can all build on. Wonderful. We're going to continue with our agenda. But before we do, raise your hand if you've ever worked in a restaurant in the food services industry. And there you have it, gentlemen. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Thank you all so much. Thank you. Thank you all so much. Okay. Next step, Daniel Defense. Bart, would you come on down and speak to us here? Great job, guys. Thank you. We really want to raise your hand. All right. Thanks for having us, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Bart. Appreciate to be here. I'd like to introduce a couple folks I've got with me. Sean Poler, who is our Director of Youth. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We're going to look through a kind of a different lens, a smaller business, kind of give you an update on where we are. Just want to show you kind of a head count here. Last year, kind of year to date this year. We've seen from first part of 2022 to last lighter part of 2022. We've upped about 60 plus heads. We're down about 20. So this year it will be a flat year for us. We use about three temp services. That's typically how we, you know, enroll our folks. We'll have them as a temp anywhere from three to six months. And then hire them on this full time based on attendance and performance and business need. So we'll usually carry about 40 to 50 temps around the year just for that purpose. We can only usually see out in our business as you can imagine it is a very volatile business depending on what's happening in the world. So about six months, we can have a pretty good idea of what's going to happen after that. It's who knows. We've got about 32 positions open now that typically ranges anywhere from probably 30 to 50. And it takes us a long time like I'm sure everybody else in the room is to hire 30 people you're talking about not days but several weeks and months depending on the role. So and we're scheduled if we look at about three years from now, we're scheduled to probably double our early head count. So we've got about 2.25 or so early. So we're expecting to double that. And then if we look five and 10 years out, we'll continue that trend. And we're going to have a lot of automation going on right now in our business. And that's not obviously to take the place of our employees. That's just how we get better and not be so dependent on labor. I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time on this but you know, you ask us kind of talk and take a look at a little bit about turnover and retention. You know, prior to COVID, we were sitting right around that 10, 11% turnover mark. We're about 15% overall. We hit about 15% last year. We're on target to hit another about 15% this year. So as you guys know, folks will move from one job to the other for 50 cents or less. And it's, you know, we've got the same issues and challenges as everyone else in the room. It's the shining new penny across the road is with the competitive wages. So we're constantly trying to figure out how we how we retain talent. We've got one of our.

organizational goals I'll mention is become employer of choice. That can mean a lot of things and a lot of different to a lot of different people. But you know, a lot of that is just focused on what are we doing internally, what type of programs, what type of engagement, what type of interaction somebody mentioned, you know, have fun in the workplace. We've got a number of initiatives going on at Daniel Defense now that will hopefully pay dividends later. This just kind of shows you a little bit about what we've been doing over the last two or three years. A lot of it is repetitive as to what I've heard from other employers. The things in green you'll see is probably the things that we've had the best luck with. And I think, you know, if you ask the folks that's been in the grit of it, we've tried most everything that we know to try and we're not ashamed to still ideas from others. So I'll kind of talk a little bit about radio. It's probably been by far the best ticket in terms of recruiting talent. Done a lot with our marketing social media. We've done a lot with the school systems, Effingham, Metter, Brian County. We've got a lot of good relationships throughout Brian County in high schools. We did a lot of what many of you said probably two years ago. We did it for the last actually couple three years is getting our grade school, middle school, high school students along with their parents to come in and take a tour of the plant. Let us talk to them about education, about career paths within Daniel Defense. Let them know and let the parents know more importantly that, you know, manufacturing is not this dark, dingy, bad place to work. We've got a showcase plant. It shows well to potential employees. It shows well to our customers. It's a state of the art facility that we're very proud of. And I think that's one way that we have gained a lot of traction there. We've done a lot of work-based learning programs. We've got referral programs in place and we've got a really good relationship with Georgia Southern. We've got a head of the Paulson program. We actually partnered with Georgia Southern and started that program a couple years ago. And what that is is these are high school students that are earmarked. They're going to enroll in Georgia. So they have enrolled to Georgia Southern and earmarked toward the engineering program. So we get them before we begin them as a co-op. We've got a really good co-op program with them as well. So that kind of stair steps them away through the process. They start out on the plant floor as a high school student. Gets into the Georgia Southern engineering program. And then we do three years typically with that co-op to just run them through the process. So that's been a really good program, really good partnership. We've also had with Savannah Tech. Appreciate you guys support. We just formulated partnership with the Gitchi Tech with a lot of our automation initiatives that Sean and his team is working through. So a lot of things, but again, just labor shortages continues to be a challenge. So recruiting challenges. Again, a lot of what you guys have said, so we have, we'll call it's almost like speed dating. We'll work through our staffing agencies and we'll have a speed dating event if you will and have 20, 25 folks to show up for that event. And we can count probably, you know, eight, ten of those will just no show. We've got folks that unfortunately have a difficulty passing drug screens and background checks. You know, height and wage competition I mentioned early. Generation challenges. We got shift patterns. We run 24 or 7. We got weekend shifts. So, you know, not everybody is set out to work a 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. type shift on a weekend. So, but our folks run pretty much 24 or 7 and, you know, most all of us, they're no different than us. They like a day shift that they can come in and work 7 to 3, you know, 8 to 5 and be home with their families. So we've got a number of initiatives going on beginning next year to try to figure out how we, how we structure our shifts to become more family friendly and flexible options. And then remote work. Somebody mentioned that as well. We've during COVID was almost forced to get in type remote work situations and we finally got most of our folks back. And, but, you know, especially when we're hiring professional positions. One of the first things out of their mouth is, is that a remote job. So that's going to be, I think, a challenge going forward. Some of the training issues I mentioned with the Gichi Tech, Georgia Southern. We've got in-house training that we do online, especially with our skill trades folks. Savannah Tech, Georgia Tech. We've partnered with them as well. I think one of the requests, I think this has been mentioned as well. One of the requests, and I've been in various parts of Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Texas. And in each one of those states struggle and continue to struggle with the same issues we're talking today, especially in, is it relates to skill trades when you talk about maintenance, welding, CNC operators, tool makers, programmers. Those are the type of skills that we're setting here saying that we need. We understand how to get them early, develop them. So if we can figure out a feeder pool, I guess, if you will, to just continue having the structures in place and the curriculum in place to bring those kids through, I think that would serve us all well. So I think that's all I've got. Wonderful. Thank you so much for that presentation. Very helpful in your commitment to the community and hiring people and giving them good jobs. We have questions from the committee members. Senator Halpern, if we can just grab a microphone and send a rest of us. Thank you. Thank you very much. Just a question. We've talked a lot already today about folks coming out and having that lack of basic soft skills. I noticed on your graph though that you also said that there was a lack of ability to pass a basic skills assessment. Would you just elaborate a little bit more on what it is exactly that's missing there? Someone called on Donna or Shawn either one they could probably talk through that. It's basically just a very short. So we take a look at a skill set. If I leave anything out here, you guys can add to it. But we give them a basic skill set and that skill test and that test is based on kind of mirror what we're going to be asking them to do on the shop floor. So basic math skills, measurements, reading comprehension, following directions, etc. And we basically are looking for a certain grade on that. So that is a knockout if they don't get a certain score on that. So what really triggered the basic skills which was about five years ago we ran a pilot program. What triggered that is that we hired an individual that couldn't read. And so Daniel, if you've got work orders and things to read, it really feeds the manufacturing process. So we had got a labor attorney involved. We talked about what are the different topics and subjects and the basic skills assessment that we would need. So reading comprehension, basic math, they're given a calculator and there's some quality instrumentation. And so we utilized existing workforce. We started with the workers and the leaders. And then we had them take this basic skills test is 10-12 questions based at about the eighth grade level. And we took all the results and then we had our labor attorney examine what those results were. And we looked for any adverse impact per se. We adjusted that a little bit and we did around two. And so we finally came to a good basic skills test that we felt was good for anybody walking through the door that was going to take on a manufacturing job. That there was kind of a key indicator for us whether or not we move forward with the interview or not. And then that was the first year. Every year we've taken all of the results year after year. We've had that analyzed with a labor attorney that we hire and we were in communication with each and every year. And to see if we need to adjust, make sure there's no adverse reaction or impact. And so it's worked very well for us. Other questions? Bart, thank you so much for your presentation and time today. We look forward to following up with you. Okay, next step with our military council, Patrick and Emma one. Good morning everyone. I am Emily and Hastings from the Army Community Service Employment Readiness Program. What we like to focus at the employment readiness program is about mostly our military spouses. We do also service our veterans, our retirees, other family members and also our transitioning members. Well right now what we do is we focus on our over 9,000 spouses within the Fort Stewart Hunter Army airfield area. That being said, excuse me, a lot of our spouses are considered what we would say under recognized. Due to the fact that a lot of our spouses come back to me and say well I couldn't get a job because they say we have a job gap. Well to understand a lot of the job gap or they also say that if you're a military spouse you won't be staying in our area very long. However that's pretty much a misnomer. When we talk about military spouses, their average state in an area is three to four, sorry not three to four, four to five years in an area. In addition, a lot of our spouses also have degrees, about 34% of them have bachelor's degrees and about 15% have master's degrees. So to not be able to get a job is a little disheartening for a lot of them. There are also spouses out there who are extremely eager to go ahead and work for the local companies. I have seen that I have actually seen have been able to get jobs within say Gulf Stream, the Chatham County Sheriff's Office and also with our local hospitals. But that's again a small amount. What we're looking at, what we do at Army Community Services to assist these spouses and the family members and the veterans is to go ahead and provide one on one resume writing, resume writing reviews, resume writing skills. We also provide classes on interview skills. We do addressing for success. We also go over career goal setting. Many of our spouses after so many years of traveling and working in just one industry from the past, they're also looking to go ahead and change their careers. So in that respect, if they're saying they were prior, they were prior military and they were doing logistics, they would like to go into the HR field. So we go into how do they get to the HR field now. What we also provide for them is a chance to go ahead and meet with the employers. We have a new system, a new event that we call Ion Employment. Now Ion Employment itself is very unique to this area. I have not really seen it too many in other bases I've been at. With Ion Employment, it's basically a weekly mini job fair. This provides not just the spouses, not just the veterans, but also our transitioning members to meet with the local companies and see the kind of talent that's out there that the military is providing. We also have different webinars and also hybrid events where they'll be online and in person that they can go and either meet with the veterans. We also have classes in regards to resume, writing, interview skills and so on. We also conduct military spouse fairs, which some of the companies in this room have actually been at and we do thank you for that. The companies that are getting to meet some of this talent and to be honest, military spouses, if they have taken, let's say, about a year sabbatical to go ahead and travel to the US. They have never lost those skills. It's important to understand they don't lose the skills they are there. They are resources that need to be utilized by local companies wherever they go. We make sure that they get to meet the companies that are out there. In addition, we actually partner with our transition assistance program with the US, so and so on. In the transition assistance program, which Mr. Dean will go ahead and review, is they have a program called Teams, which stands for transition employment assistance military spouses. With that, they provide modules, same as what we provide in person over at Army Community Service. They provide modules on resume writing, job search skills, interviewing and so on. But for more of that and more about the transition assistance program, I have Mr. Dean. So first of all, good morning to everybody. Good afternoon, right now. So before we get started, on behalf of General Norrie, the Garrison Commanders, the Force of the Humour Afear, we appreciate the time coming up. Discuss what you guys and offer you guys some opportunities to understand how we can meet your workforce needs. First of all, and we're saying that I'll be remiss to say this and I got to get it out the way. I'm a big football fan, so it is a pleasure to honor to see you, Mr. Chad, I'm all with you, right? So I got it out the way, I'm feeling better now. Very few times you get opportunities to be in the presence of a whole family, so it's definitely close to me. So, what that being said, hey, first of all, my name is Patrick Bean. I rent an Army transition program located for the Humour Afear. I retired after 26 years of the military. I was a time-fill artillery commander, so I understand targeting. So my offer to each one of you is understanding precision targeting what we're talking about employment. Who are we targeting, but more importantly, how are you targeting? So I offer this question up to everybody. How are you communicating your employment needs, your employment demands to military service members and spouses? How are you doing? I don't need to ask a butt. I want you to think about it. You're not including the tap social media. You're not including connecting with the tap program. The program's the one here, a hundred, for Stuart, as well as for bidding, for Gordon and Kings Bay, Georgia. I think you're doing yourself for this service. Here's why. We have in Georgia, we have over 700,000 veterans residing right here in Georgia. Veterans. Okay, 700,000 residing right here in Georgia. In the next few years, we're going to have a half million service members that's going to separate out military forces. Georgia is one of the top 10 states that we recruit service members from. Top 10. So what does that mean to you? That means to you that the population, the employment demand that you're seeking, the supply is there. Your challenge becomes, again, how are you communicating? How are you communicating? What are we missing? What are you missing? How are we meeting in the middle to solve this workforce issue we have it? Okay, so offer that challenge up to you first and foremost. So I appreciate you for taking the world of homework, glad short time you're right to the point. I'm going to offer you some numbers. What we do it across the tap program is this. We're starting our soldiers to transition out 18 months prior. Most of them starting within a year time window. We're starting to inoculate that process of what transition look like. What are you going to be when you grow up? What's next for you? That's what we're engaging our soldiers on. We're engaging our soldiers on what they current careers are. How did that career to end? How it translates to the next career to going? For those of you that didn't know, 50% of our soldiers, but their specific military occupation, especially, they are not going to that particular, that particular specialty when they separate. Okay, one of the biggest misperceptions out there are use law enforcement not to pick on law enforcement. Most of our military personnel law enforcement, they're not going to military law enforcement. They're not going for various reasons. A lot of our soldiers come in other different particular moenses, but they're going out for other opportunities. They're seeking other opportunities as well. I've listened to a lot of people communicate of who we're attracting. The kids in high school and all that stuff is great. Again, I offer you how are we reaching and communicating to our service members as transitioning since 2020, since 2020, in on average, for Stewart is transitioning $3,000 service members. 100 on average is transitioning five to 600 service members each year. Each year, since 2020, Georgia gets approximately $2,000 service members from other installations that's coming back to Georgia to make it home. Okay, so the numbers, the demand, the supply, the numbers is being supplied. My challenge is how we get my supply to meet your demand, but I need your help in making it happen. Okay, we have career skills programs. I left most, if I didn't get everybody's information, please feel free to send me email. I passed information on to you, but I left most of the panel members folder. A lot of information is in there. The brochures are a program. I want to highlight our career skills programs. I heard a lot of people talk about the apprenticeship programs and also the great stuff. We have what's called career skills programs. We have what's called skill bridge programs. Our career skills programs is organic to force to the hunter. We have 11, 12 platforms is there. We have platforms right now that are training soldiers, 18, excuse me, 180 days prior to them separating to go into different career fields. A lot of career fields in here right now. We have soldiers training logistics. We have soldiers training at CDL. We have soldiers training skill trades. We have soldiers training at IT. We have soldiers training at the veteran service representatives. We have soldiers training in the ray of career skills fields right now. So once they separate, they're ready to go to work. I offered it up to you because here's where I challenged my team to tell all employees. You want to hire soldiers? We want you to sponsor our career skills programs. Okay. We got a logistic demand. We have a logistic platform. We're training soldiers on logistics right now. We're training soldiers on forkle and certification. We're training soldiers on logistics supply chain. We're training soldiers on that right now throughout career skills platforms. Here's the big one. What does it cost you? It costs you zero dollars. It costs you zero dollars. You know how much more can it cost you to communicate to soldier zero dollars. You know how much hiring events cost you to come engage our soldiers zero dollars. Because we're doing it all for you. We are setting this platform up because we want our soldiers to be successful when they transition. So that's why we're doing what we're doing. But we're continuing to meet. We're continuing to have the gaps there. Now if it's talking to Maria, we have a lot of conversations. We go back and forth in great ways. And I always said I always use the conversation that it seems like the BMW mechanic. Every time we have events, I always use the BMW mechanic. I hate to pick on the guy. But I told the BMW mechanic one time. I said, stay around for four hours. It gains a lot of soldiers. I said, so how many soldiers you think you might be in a heart? He said, well, Mr. Bean, I got to try to figure something out. Down the road he told me not to meet nobody. He could finally look for basically. So basically your problem is this. So the BMW employee trying to hire BMW mechanic. What you just missed is that we don't have BMW mechanics. We have light wheel vehicle mechanics. They work on us costs. They work with BMW mechanics. So what you have to understand is that you get an army, a C certified mechanic that can be translated and converted to BMW mechanic. So I say that to say, when you go back to your HR team, have your HR team look at things that we're teaching our soldiers inside your folder right now. We have things that's called industrial competency models, right? So we thought her soft skills. I heard a lot of stuff that's being said today. I will tell you when you look at the industrial models, right? Our soldiers bring to you five of them to your competencies already. Okay. They're coming with soft skills. They're coming with technical skills. They're coming with advanced skills. They're coming with training. They're coming with certifications. There's no soldier in our formation. That's not certified by the United States Army right now. For every plumber we have in our army, the Army has certified. For every just a specialist, the Army has certified. For every particular in-laws or occupation you can think about, our army has certified that individual. So the challenge to you becomes how do I meet this employment gap, this workforce gap, how do I make it happen? How do I get the soldiers I'm looking for? How do I get the people I'm looking for? What do I need? Is it within our formations? Yes it is. How do I connect to it? I have to reach out. Who do I reach out to? Who's my point of contact? What else are my offering the TAP program? What is the TAP program missing? What are we missing? We have some internal studies. We kind of know some things we're missing. We have to work better at the CGS working with the Zorn, Geras, Command and Sforgin with the Zorn. We understand that. That's our dynamics we can control. The things we can't control is the dynamic of how we get more than 35% of our soldiers to stay in Georgia. That's what we need you guys help out right there. We want to keep the soldiers transitioning. We want to keep most of them here because the jobs are here. The jobs are here. I'm only one person. I'm only one person. That's only so much I can do. We're reaching out to you guys to help us meet the men. Sir, I'm 17. Questions? First thank you for your incredible work and passion. Both of you. I don't think there's anything we can do that's more important than to help out our greatest heroes and thank you for your service. We have as a general assembly the last many years helped to work on translating certifications and other training that people have had from other states that they've moved in the Georgia for both our active duty military as well as their spouses. And hopefully that's helping some as well as I just want to remind everyone here we also exempted up to thirty seven thousand five hundred hours of retirement income from those who have served us in the military. So hopefully those are our two little pieces that are helping but it sounds like to me that you've got an extraordinary program with tap here. We need to make sure we're connecting the dots for you more than we have in the past because we've got a lot of folks that need help and you've got some of the best workers that could possibly want. And I think it's going to be our task to figure out as a state how can we facilitate making those connections better and supporting the great work that you and your team are doing. Are there questions from the committee members? Question from Senator Halpern? We'll pass you on microphone. I have a question that I'm trying to figure out exactly how to ask but we've talked a lot today about kind of getting kids started early and how do we enter people into careers kind of from high school. We've talked our day about our baby boomers who've retired and that I'm wondering if there is a unspoken perception about our military members service members as they transition. And so I don't I'm just going to have to ask this question like this. I don't know how to phrase it differently. What is just out of curiosity the average age of a person who is transitioning out of the military back into the workforce. So you got to you got two populations of let's say our soldiers that do not retire on average the average way 18 and 25. And then we got our souls at our retirement. So we're talking 35 to 45. So we got two ranges of individuals that are separated. But all young people. But all young right. I mean all in multiple different stages of their career path as it relates to the trajectory of an entire career. Would the need to be able to move on to the next stage. Your career. Yes, ma'am. But with each stage of that career service, the development process is happening as well as advanced learning as well as advanced skills as well as a whole lot of things as well as let's make it a career. Because that's in the day to our warm as institution that's seeking to employ them as well too. So at the end of the day we have that that wide range of people that are separating a various ages. But I wouldn't I wouldn't allow the perception and or what we may perceive as perception. Straits away from how we meet the challenges. I think we have to identify what the perceptions are. But more importantly, how we make the perceptions we take them from being rumours and make them facts. And I think that's where we all win it right there. Other questions. Thank you so much for your presentation today. We appreciate it. So we have a full. Yes. We have a full. I feel appreciate the time. So it's for like. Thank you. Okay, and our final presenter of the day will be from Goodwill, Michael Meredith and Bill if you would come on down. Okay. Good morning. I'm Michael Winkler, president and CEO for Goodwill of Southeast Georgia. And with me today I have Meredith Champagne, our vice president of strategy and Bill Kelso, our vice president of mission advancement. And they're the really smart folks in the room so they'll be helping me stay on point here. So it's a real pleasure to be here. We are one of 155 local and autonomous Goodwill from around the country. Our Goodwill is responsible for 29 counties here in Southeast Georgia from Savannah down to Camden County out to where county. Vidalia and up to Scriven County. So we cover a wide catchment area and our organization operates with three other Goodwills within the state. We define ourselves as a social enterprise and the reason that we refer to ourselves as a social enterprise is because we're 98.5% self sufficient. Our programs, most of you are probably familiar with a little thing called our Goodwill Thrift stores. I'm here today to talk about the story behind the stores, but between our stores are manufacturing operations and our business service operations. We provide jobs to over 600, 80 individuals currently by the end of the year we expect to be at near 750 associates in Southeast Georgia and our operating budget this year will exceed $44 million. So we are fairly complex, fairly large workforce development organization. I'm going to repeat that because everybody knows our stores. We are a workforce development organization since our founding in 1902 in Boston, Massachusetts. We have always been a workforce development organization. What we do is we help individuals with challenges and obstacles to sustainable employment achieve their career goals, achieve their work and employment goals and hopefully achieve the American dream. So how do we do that? We do that with three pillars of operation. We do that with support services that we provide to all of these individuals. Most of the individuals that we serve have multiple barriers to sustainable employment. We also provide educational opportunities.

a wonderful partnership that we have with the TCSG locally here with Savannah Technical College, a Geechy Technical College, and Coastal Pines Technical College. In fact, to date, we've already awarded $31,000 in scholarships to individuals that we serve in Southeast Georgia to attend the technical colleges for credentialing. And then the final piece of it is we are a labor exchange organization. So not only do we hire individuals with challenges and obstacles to work within our three programs, but we also help place the majority, frankly 75% of the individuals that we place or placed in the community with local area businesses that we partner with. So who are the people that we serve? I'm going to turn it over to Meredith. We've served many people through different contracts. So within Southeast Georgia we are a provider to serve a Georgia vocational. We also work with the Veterans Administration, their employment and training divisions. We also work with the Department of Family and Children Services helping individuals receive public assistance to gain employment and skills training to help break that cycle of poverty. And the majority of those individuals that we see through what we call our opportunity centers are self-reformals, or coming in through our community partners, whether that's through the housing authority or other social service agencies. And so some of the trends that we are seeing with individuals is they're not just unemployed, 50%, they're under employed. So the 65% that we're looking at there is the federal poverty level for a house of one that's roughly 14,500 or less in income into their house annually. And so we're looking at how we can break that. So as we're looking at educational opportunities and ways to break that cycle, we're looking at this 15% that do not have a whole school diploma. What we do know is those who have a high school diploma versus those who don't earn 37% more annually just from gaining that. If they gain stackable credentials from a technical college system, they can earn up to 56% more annually within the environment. And as some of these individuals we are serving are also parents. We know that 50% of our students are more likely of parents who dropped out to be 50% more likely to drop out themselves. So we're definitely looking for ways to serve the community in very meaningful ways, not just to get them employed but get them that sustainable wage to help them move out of poverty and be able to thrive. So we're not only workforce development, but we're workforce development with the purpose of breaking generational poverty and helping individuals through to a better pathway to success. So what are the challenges? You all are here to hear about the state of workforce development and what the challenges are ahead. When I'm asked in the community by community leaders what keeps me up at night, this is what keeps me up at night. The challenge that we have in our community and the fact of the matter is we have thousands of individuals here in Southeast Georgia that although we are seeing an unprecedented economic boom in our community, there will be thousands of individuals that currently subsist in our community and the truth of the matter is should we not be able to provide education in a pathway forward for those individuals to take advantage of this economic boom, they will be left behind. That's what keeps me up at night and that's what we're really focused in on today as the modern goodwill if you will. We're really focused on helping individuals with challenges and obstacles that really involve educational deficits, remediation, there's a number of different ways you can define it, but these are individuals that lack a high school diploma or have barely graduated from high school and really lack the academic prowess to be successful at not only the technical college or a four-year institution but going to work as an apprentice in a job directly. So here to talk about what we're doing about that is Bill Kelsow. So two slides to bring it home and then I turn it back to you. Senator Mallow, your timing is perfect. As he came in I was thinking where is the center so I could point him out we are goodwill was asked to participate through the senator who is the community quarterback. For these Savannah United purpose-built community initiative off Wheaton Street model after East Lake and we know the success of East Lake. East Lake foundation was actually right then years ago by some visionary folks to work with this community to really focus on this Wheaton Street corridor. And so goodwill is prepared to join the YMSA and a joint venture focused on this property right here. That's 40,000 square feet through a joint venture with the YMCA and the vision is goodwill would be upstairs not with the store but with adult ed our opportunity centers all the services that we currently provide and more down the road. All of this is happening again because of leaders like Senator Mallow who with the work with the county found some splos dollars to build an early learning center and that's what his focus is going to be on as well as the grounds, a library and other development around. Sandwiched in between, brand new elementary school just up the road. You've got East Broad which is still providing educational services and continued look at what housing looks like in this area. We're excited to be a part also because Randy's Barbeque is still there and probably will remain there. The point being is being a part of this project is fits beautifully with our mission which is serving a community, particularly 31404 zip code which has needs and is a community that is desperate but more so deserving for this kind of redevelopment and we simply want to be a part. My understanding and as I read the task of this committees I wrap this up is you know so what do solutions look like this isn't new. I want to thank the Senate for your support and my comments are not about last year's Senate Bill 112 but I do thank the Senate for their support. When we look at solutions we heard a lot throughout all the presentations and well done everybody but about youth and getting youth through the pipeline and into the kind of post-secondary opportunities apprenticeship programs particularly through the technical college. Absolutely spent 30 years in higher ed certainly understand that but it is our adult learners many who Commissioner frankly would never come to Armstrong back in the day or come to you now that Michael just talked about that need a pathway and so the model that comes out of Indianapolis Indiana the Excel Center which we've talked about at length is focused on an in-person adult high school concept publicly funded with the RAP services to help remove those key barriers that are keeping them from being successful in the classroom but most importantly feeding them into those stackable programs and they're regionally speaking those kinds of apprenticeships or other opportunities armed with that high school diploma that'll allow them to be economically successful and so with the Excel Center as an example there are other examples out there the challenges is from a public policy standpoint working with business and corporations but also looking for philanthropic solutions there's real opportunity to also help the older adult rise in a time when there's lots of opportunities out there see into my comments. Well thank you that was both inspiring and enlightening I will count myself as one of those people that only knew that was where I got to drop off and donate some good things and there was the store so clearly there's some incredible work that you're doing not just here but I'm sure across the state and nation again I think to some of the area we've got to connect the dots because the programs you have are truly extraordinary and I think that's where we can really help people with what I like to call a hand up versus a hand out long term because we want to help teach people to fish and be sustainable and then hopefully go back and help others so Michael you and your team are doing a phenomenal job here and obviously the work with Senator Mallow as well are there questions from the committee members oh it was so good you don't even have any questions well done thank you chairman thank you committee we appreciate your time today thank you all right we're going to begin closing out the meeting here first thing I want to do those I want to take a special thank you or say a special thank you to Lee Hughes his wife Amy and their son Jensen worked together with Hughes Public Affairs I will tell you nobody has been a bigger champion for Savannah and the coast of Georgia then Lee and Amy and what they do a really unmatched for serving all of us so thank you for everything you did to put this together we could have done it without you I want to remind people that our next meeting will be coming up will be meeting at the key a plant out in West Point in Georgia that is going to be on August the 22nd we will have more information and specifics available on the website if you again interested in being a speaker we are filling those slots up quickly please reach out on us know or submit us your testimony by the website or by email this was a great meeting we have learned a lot I'm going to ask the committee members that if you have any specific thoughts or ideas for the report to please that there's over to Haley sooner than later and what I've found in doing these over the many years is we hear lots of good ideas and then we get to the fourth or fifth meeting and you're trying to remember what we did in those first couple meetings the quicker we get those over to her to capture will make it that much better and informative as we come up with that final report here later in the year are there any final questions or comments from the committee members before we adjourn seeing none thank you so much this meeting is hereby adjourned
