Well good morning, happy Friday, happy brave parade day, a great day.
We will begin our day with Scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain after which we will
pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the lady from the 54th House District
Representative Betsy Holland, Representative Holland.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I could not be more delighted today to bring my pastor, the Reverend Katie Omen, to speak
with you today.
She comes from my church Morningside Presbyterian, which is right down the road for any of you
who might like to join us while we're in session.
I started attending that church in 2004
and was drawn to it because of its commitment
to welcome everyone and its commitment
to service outside its four walls
to do good in our community.
I've served there as a deacon,
as a Sunday school leader, as a volunteer.
The Reverend Katie Oman has not been there as long as I have.
She was called to our pulpit as the senior pastor
and head of staff in March of 2020.
You heard that correctly?
She started with us in March of 2020,
kicking off one of the first meetings
in the Presbyteria to call a pastor
that had to be done over Zoom.
She faced the tremendous challenge
of having to unite a congregation
that she could not meet with and person
and preaching to a sanctuary where no one was in the pews.
And I cannot say enough about the way
that she created genuine fellowship and community outreach
and worship and pastoral care during an unprecedented time.
In our congregation, the greatest thing to come out of 2020
with Pastor Katie.
She's a graduate of Duke University
and graduated seminary at our own Columbia Seminary here
in Georgia.
One of the greatest things about being back in church in person
is getting to know her husband,
Wait, who's a pediatric oncologist at Children's Healthcare
and getting to see her two small children Molly and Jack
running around the playground.
I hope you'll join me in welcoming
our Pastor Katie today.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, thank you, Representative Holland.
It is an honor to be with you this morning and to pray blessing upon your work, because
the work that you do here is holy work.
I invite you to hear these words of scripture from Paul's letter to the Ephesians the
fourth chapter, a passage that we use at Morningside Presbyterian to begin everyone of our
leadership meetings as a session.
I therefore, prisoner of the Lord, beg you to lead a life worthy of the calling to which
you have been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one
another in love, making every effort to maintain the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace.
You know, as a Presbyterian, I am reminded that one of my denominations founding theologians,
John Calvin, believed that the work of civil servants, civil magistrates, as he called them
in the 15th century, was among the highest callings by God, even above preachers like
myself much to our chagrin.
The calling was of the highest authority because you are entrusted with the well-being
of society, with the peace and prosperity of those under your care.
Calvin believed that both the work of religious leaders and of civil leaders was work ordained
by God, and in that way elected leaders like yourselves and faith leaders of all religious
traditions like myself enter into our work with a sense of calling.
My suspicion is that each of you, if you thought back to the first election, the first time
that you ran for office, that there was something about you that was called to make your
community and your state a better place.
Whether that calling came from within or from concerns you saw within the community or
from God, God's self, I have to believe that there was something in you that ignited
call to lead. So now think about where that call began and where you are today to
continue to follow that call requires that you are able to hear. The Dutch
Catholic theologian Henry Nguyen once commented that there is just so much
noise in the world. Emails and tweets and town halls and message boards and
voicemails, so much noise that our lives have become in his words absurd. Because in the word absurd
is the Latin word certis, which means death. With so much noise we become unable to hear what it is
that we are called to do. To filter out all of the noise back to that central purpose. On the other
hand now and says the word obedient comes from the Latin word
adirae which means to listen. He says therefore a spiritual life is a
pilgrimage from absurdity to obedience, from deafness to listening.
So as those entrusted with the best interest of Georgians, perhaps
you're calling in the work that you do here is to filter out the
noise even down to the crowds cheering for the World Series Champion
braves outside and to listen to one another to your heart and to God as you
in Paul's words lead a life worthy of the calling to which you have been
called. I thank you for your leadership and for the call placed on each of
your life and invite you to stand that we might join in prayer.
So let us pray.
Holy God, we begin our days aware of blessings beyond our control.
The beauty of a new day as the sun rises each morning.
The possibility for community and connection.
The capacity for meaningful work and love of neighbor
our very breath for these things we are grateful.
We also begin each day aware of the possibility
to make your world a better place.
We give thanks for the call placed upon each of these leaders
to guide the state toward a place of flourishing for all.
Grant them listening ears to one another
and to those they are called to serve.
Bless them with discerning minds and understanding hearts
instill in them both the patience and the imagination necessary to work toward a
sense of beloved community for all entrusted to their care. As these leaders go
about their work let the aisle be something that they traverse rather than a
line of division unite their goals and hopes around the betterment of all
Georgians. Help us to see that there is more that unites us than divides us so
that we might set aside animosity and work together with hope.
We pray blessing upon Georgia and all who live and labor within its bounds, fill the land
with peace as its leaders work toward justice, inspire neighborliness and a sense of responsibility
to one another.
Watch over the least of these whom you have called your children.
opportunities for growth not just economically but in our spirits, that kindness, compassion,
mercy and joy might define this state's character. And then above all grant us a sense of humility
that all we are able to do is but a slice of a greater story that ends in Shalom, your abiding
peace. And it's in your many names that we pray. Amen.
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America
and to the Republic for which it stands when nation under God
indivisible with liberty and justice for all.
You

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Your Committee on Information and Audits has read the journal of a previous legislative day and found it to be correct.
And it was only about six pages in it, but it didn't take long.
And furthermore, Mr. Speaker, when government is big enough to give you everything you
want, it's big enough to take everything you have, Thomas Jefferson.
Of course, now, Representative Williams would probably take a long time reading those six
pages.
Is there any objection to the confirmation of the journal?
Chair here is none, and the journal is confirmed.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Colleagues, over the last couple of weeks, I've had a lot of communication with constituents,
online in-person, text, phone calls.
What do you guess they wanted to talk about?
series? Nope. Build back better? No. Ed's lost in Cherokee County? No. Reapportionment? No.
They wanted to know if they were going to have to change their clocks this weekend. That's
what they want to talk about. Do we have to change our clocks this weekend? And unfortunately,
The answer is yes.
I want to encourage each of you to go online.
Senator Patty Murray from Washington
gave an impassioned speech on the Senate floor yesterday
trying to get our senators to get off their rear ends
and support a bipartisan bill in the Senate
which would accomplish the end of time change.
There's also a bipartisan bill in the House
which would accomplish the same thing.
When we passed this bill out of this chamber
And out of the other chamber and the governor signed it,
we let them know what we wanted.
And that was bipartisan in both chambers.
So I would encourage you to reach out to your congressmen.
I reached out to all of our delegation and our senators.
And three of our congressmen have co-sponsored the legislation.
But I would encourage Senator Ossoff and Senator Warnock
to join in and co-sponsored the legislation the Senate.
Please reach out to your congressmen and encourage
them to do the same thing on the house side. Next week we'll begin what I call the double
dark commute. Many Georgians will get up in the dark, they'll leave home in the dark,
and they'll come home from work in the dark, and people are tired of it. It's an antiquated
system, we need to fix it, so I encourage you to get involved. Thank you.
