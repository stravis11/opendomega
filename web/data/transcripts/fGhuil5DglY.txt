TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good morning everyone, good to have everyone here today. I think I want to thank the members
of the media who are attendance today. I also want to thank members of the business community
that are here today. We have a representation from the Georgia Chamber as well as the Atlanta
Metro Chamber and the NFIB and the Americans for Prosperity is here as well. I also like
to thank our members of the Senate, both a majority leader, Gooch and leadership leader
Dugan and Dolezal, Walker, Strickland, Payne and Hustettler, and cannot forget Mr. Beech
as well.
So, one of my favorites, but today we are here to highlight some initiatives that we're
going to have as a Senate, this upcoming legislative session, for years I've always talked
about during the second, in my times in the Senate, during the second portion of a biennial,
we ought to be looking at ways to help businesses reduce burdens in regulations and eliminate
as much red tape as possible through the legislative process.
And that's why I'm excited that our Senate members for the majority caucus are very
engaged and energetic about doing that.
upcoming legislature session, we are proud to, we're going to call it the red tape rollback
and it is going to be a champion of small businesses by trying to eliminate unneeded, like
I said, burdens of red tape and bureaucratic hurdles that a lot of small businesses have
to undertake in order to get either expand or either get started in communities around
the state, so we want to be, we want to be, to take on that initiative and be the ones
to lead the charge on being the small business friendly state.
And one of those pieces of legislation is Senate Bill 157 that our good friend, Senator
Strickland, authored last year, which actually passed the Senate unanimously 55-0.
He would think something so overwhelmingly popular in the Senate would have no problem
in the House.
But unfortunately it was held up a little bit and I wanted to call on Senator Strickland
and then after that call on Senator Larry Walker who's going to talk about some of the work
that he had done during the offseason to address these issues that I think are important
to small businesses, important to Georgians, families and I think they won't make a lot
big headlines but they will be very beneficial to small and businesses around our
state. So Senator Strickland. Good morning. Great to be with you all this
morning. Thank you Lieutenant Governor Jones and members of the my caucus
here with us and some of our friends in the business community as well. As
Lieutenant Governor Jones mentioned one of our great initiatives this past
session we continue to work on and the outcome in 24 session is Senate Bill 157.
As he mentioned, everybody standing up here, either supported that bill or voted for that
bill.
When it passed the Senate last year, now we look to getting this bill done in the house
and it is consistent with the initiative being highlighted today by Lieutenant Governor
Jones.
Senate Bill 157 reduces barriers to employment, specifically for those who have criminal
records in our state.
With all the Georgians we have 4.5 million of us have something on our record, some sort
of criminal record in our state.
And while we've worked to reform our criminal justice system over the past decade, we still
have barriers in place that prevent these individuals that have proven they're ready to move
past, mistakes they've made in the past and enter their workforce.
One in seven jobs at the same time in our state, we call it Occupational License.
that are looking to move past our criminal justice system and our workforce as productive
members of the society are finding a system so complicated that may choose not to even
try to navigate it.
Senate Bill 157 creates a uniform process for how criminal records are considered by licensing
boards, making certain that only those past offenses that directly relate to the field
of employment and the safety of the public are used against an applicant.
It also streamlines the appeal process for those that are not a license to make sure they
can actually navigate the system without having a skilled attorney, nothing against skilled
attorneys that can be very expensive.
Finally, Senate Bill 157 provides a way for those with criminal records to learn exactly
how pass offenses will impact their ability to work prior to making an investment in getting
trained to work in a particular area.
Boards will start publishing online.
offenses that disqualify someone from working in certain industries.
And also individuals can now go with this bill through a pre-approval process and learn
how their past offenses will impact their ability to work in certain areas before they pay
for training.
There are a lot of statistics that we hear about what makes someone more likely to reoffend
after committing a crime.
And what factors increase the likelihood that someone will spend his or her life in and
out of our criminal justice system.
With all these factors, though, the ability to work, to gain a skill, and
support of family is one of the most obvious things that can allow someone to become a productive member of society.
With Senate Bill 157 becomes law, it will directly help individuals stop the cycle of entering the criminal justice system for providing employment opportunities that will lead to generational change for our families in our state.
We will also directly address the workforce needs for employers in our state, rate of
higher workers and high demand areas.
With small businesses around the state struggling to find employees, and with a continued need
to give a hand up to individuals that are ready to leave our criminal justice system behind
and become tax paying citizens.
The passage of Senate Bill 157 is critical.
I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House to get this bill out this next
session on to the desk of Governor Kim.
And so with that, speaking of occupational licensing,
I'm going to turn it over to our chairman of our industry,
who actually is called our insurance and labor committee,
and the Senate who's also chairing a committee
I'm serving on this session, a study committee
to look at occupational licensing in our state.
So I'll turn it over to my friend, Larry Walker.
Thank you for giving me your name.
Well, good morning.
Good to be with you all this morning.
I certainly appreciate Senator Strickland's work
on that important piece of legislation.
And I'm confident we're going to get that pass
in the 24 session.
The lieutenant governor is a, he likes to say a small business
owner.
I'll just say a business owner, himself,
and he understands better than anybody.
The problems we have with over regulation and bureaucracy
and red tape.
So I'm proud to play a small role in trying to make Georgia a better place to work and
give people the right to work without having to pay the state a tax basically to do that.
And I appreciate Lieutenant Governor's support in this endeavor and I look forward to what
we're going to be able to accomplish.
I recently attended an announcement.
of you were there, where we, for the 10th consecutive year in the road, announced that site selection
magazine named Georgia, the number one place in the nation to do business. We're very, very
proud of that, and that's because we've had great governors and great lieutenant governors
and great conservative leadership for the last decade, and I'm particularly proud that we're
seeing a lot of economic growth in rural parts of the state, but because of all this economic
development success and the pro-business environment that we have here in Georgia, we are facing
a lot of workforce shortages. I hear that everywhere I go no matter what industry speak
to as challenges with workforce, and this challenge is going to impede our economic growth
if we don't address some of the barriers to that and it's going to impact our public welfare.
The burdensome licensing requirements that we have in this state contributed to this
workforce shortage and also impede entrepreneurship and upward mobility for our citizens.
I introduced and with the Lieutenant Governor's support past Senate Resolution 85, which is
a study committee on occupational licensing and the lieutenant governor appointed this
bipartisan committee and we've been working diligently in the interim on this issue and
I want to recognize the members of the committee senator Jason out of a tardy senator Mike
Dougan who's here with us senator Sonja Halper and senator Brian Strickland and myself
that chairs it. According to the Institute for Justice, Georgia ranks 12th in the nation
for burdensome licensing requirements. This disproportionately impacts lower income
professions and drives up consumer cost. Research has shown that licensing impediments
may result in 3 million fewer jobs nationwide. And most empirical evidence does not find that
stricter licensing requirements improve quality, public safety, or health. In Georgia we have
over 40 licenses under the Secretary of State's Professional Licensing Board Administration.
And our study committee has been working hard to see where we can reduce the licensing burden
on hard work in Georgians and protect our citizens' freedom to work.
We're looking through the lens that our state constitution protects the right to work
in one's chosen profession free from unreasonable government interference.
Our constitution tells us that as Georgians, we've got the right to work without the government
intervening and that's been upheld recently by a Georgia spring court ruling so the government
has to have a compelling reason to require a license and it has to be surrounding public
safety or consumer protection. And if the license does not involve those or does not arise
to the level that confelling reason, we shouldn't have it. And that's the lens we're looking
at all of these licenses. So we're reviewing the licensing that we have, the existing
and any proposed new licensing to see if it meets that standard.
We're looking at a potential of repealing licenses that don't meet that standard, and
the licenses that do meet that standard, we're looking at trying to pair back the cost
and the hurdles of entry into that, the cost and dollars for training and schooling and
testing and all of that and the cost in time and we are also looking at trying to go to
a more universal recognition of licenses. We've got a lot of people moving to Georgia because
we are a pro-business and we're a great place to live work and raise a family. So we want
to recognize folks that are licensed and doing similar things in other states and not require
them to start back over from scratch. And this includes our military, people exiting
the military and military spouses. And another aspect we're looking at is some of our
licensing boards are really woefully under resourced, particularly I think the nursing board.
So we want to look at where we need to allocate more resources to get. We have a huge healthcare
work for shortage. And part of it is, is it so cumbersome to try to get licensed as a nurse.
Some small examples and again we've got one more meeting and we haven't finalized our
recommendations and our report. So I don't want to get ahead of myself too much but some examples are
makeup artists, a makeup professional working in a retail environment is not required to have a
license. If they're working on a film set, they're not required to have a license. But
if they're working just, if they wanted to open their own business and be a makeup artist
for the general public, they are required to get a cosmetology license. So that really
doesn't make sense to me. We have some licenses that no other, very few other states have,
like low voltage, low voltage electrical contractors. I don't know that that makes sense.
I'm not sure why a librarian needs to be licensed, frankly.
Maybe there is a compelling public safety reason, but I haven't heard it.
Music therapist, it's another example.
And then finally, I want to speak to the calls I get, the constituent service calls I get,
overwhelming majority really are related to licensing in all different fields.
And so it's a problem no matter what industry you're in.
But I get a lot of calls from APRians, advanced registered nurses that have to get a license
through the State Nursing Board, but they have to get their protocol agreement approved
by the Composite Medical Board.
And it is, I've heard of cases where it's taken over a year to get those protocol agreements
approved.
So my idea is that they submit their protocol agreement to the Composite Medical Board
for them to have on file and it's deemed approved and they can go to work.
That's just some examples of the kind of stuff we're working on and again, I appreciate
the Lieutenant Governor supporting this endeavor and as a business owner he understands
that he gets it and I'm confident with his backing that we're going to make some good
headway on this issue.
Thank you very much and I'll turn it back over to Lieutenant Governor.
Thank you, Senator Walker and thank you, Senator Strickland, appreciate that and like
Like I said, these are issues I think that need addressing, that are important to the
individuals who affect every day, businesses and small entrepreneurs.
It might not grab a lot of headlines, but I can assure you it's meaningful, especially
to the people that it's costing them time and money because they are unable to get their
inability to get proper licensing or permits and things of that nature.
So this will conclude our press conference today.
Yeah, I know, Raul, you got a question, I believe.
I was wondering, one of the questions I had is,
see that the more certain plus that you guys are going
into this sector, is there a goal in using that,
whether it is the licensing force, the nursing force?
Right.
Because we've got the more certain plus the work.
Yeah, we do have a large surplus and we're very fortunate,
and it goes to, you know, how fiscally responsible
been as a state as a legislative body and as well as our governor. Obviously he's led the charge
on allowing us to have such a good surplus to work with. The whole legislative process
are one constitutional obligation is the balance of budget and and figure out what is the best use
for dollars. Both you know the regular appropriation money but also the surplus that we'll have as well.
So all those things will be discussed and we'll tackle some of those issues and you're right
There are some agencies that could probably
That need a little more help from a personnel standpoint
The surplus money might be a might be a good means to get there
You know, we'll look at all of them
Yes, sir
and in broadening the definition of small business under the administrative
C-directed businesses as 300 employees.
Can you or somebody talk about that?
Well, you know, I mean, obviously, you know, small businesses right now that are, I
guess, the definition on file is that it represents 100 employees.
I tend to look at it differently.
I'm objective on how I look at small businesses.
Some people think it's ten or under, some people think it's a thousand or under, you know, but this right here
will allow perming processes to be done at a faster pace, at some agencies, by putting them in this category of 300 or less.
So, any other questions? Yes, sir?
Looking at the more globalized level of municipalities and counties
are allowed to be understated law. There's a really small business
and we're allowed to see this one. Sure.
One person who companies are under the business is
and global jurisdictions are allowed to put regulations in the business license
department. That's definitely something that we've looked at before in the past.
I know Senator Dugan was being in the contractor himself.
That's the great thing about having a citizen-legislative body.
body is a lot of people are involved in our day-to-day businesses or something
outside of this chamber or this building here which gives us a unique
perspective on things and I will say that yeah we've looked at looked at
because a lot of the times the things that contractors run into or small
businesses or whatever run into is the process the slow process it can take at
the local level so whatever we can do to try to alleviate some of those burdens
we're going to look at those two, so all right. Thank you all very much. Appreciate you all being here.
