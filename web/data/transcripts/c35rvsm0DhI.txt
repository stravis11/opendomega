The resolutions are adopted.
Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate Bill 448-448?
Senate Bill 448, Senator Hatchett, the 50th Strickland, the 17th Kennedy, the 18th and
Goods, the 51st to be entitled and act to amend the official code of Georgia, and
it's a rise modernized correct errors or emissions in and reenact the statutory portion of said code.
This bill ever referred to the Committee on Code Revision, the committee recommends this bill do pass.
Chairman Yorta is recognized to present the bill, the gentleman from Silvester, Georgia.
Chairman Yorta.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I bring you Senate Bill 448.
This is the annual Code Revision Bill.
These are Georgia code edits to the code revision commission has recommended.
This is to correct grammatical errors, typos, and actually other acts that have become
obsolete or unsconstitutional.
And most importantly, this bill re-enacts a statutory provisions of our official code
of Georgia.
So our laws will stay on the books.
So it's a very important bill and I appreciate your support on this bill.
You have no questions.
I yield the well, sir.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered that Chair, here is none.
The previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable
to the passage of the bill?
Chair, here is none.
The report of the committee is agreed to.
out this bill now pass all in favor of past year the bill will vote yes all
those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine
We have all members voted.
All members vote of this, so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of Senate
bill 448, the yeas are 138, the nays are zero, this bill hasn't received a requisite
Constitutional majority is therefore passed.
Members, we all know that the summer of our family
that is moving on, that we will not return in 2025.
One of those is a dear friend of mine
that we've served together over a number of years.
He had some different capacities,
and but we've always remained friends
and had to have had great respect
for the gentleman from House District 40, Doug Stoner.
Representative Stoner, you'll recognize, come speak
to your family, Representative Stoner.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
As the speaker said,
As many of you are aware, I will not be returning to this chamber next year.
Once it was clear that Representative Noel Woods is Terry, and I would be in the same
new district, I made the decision not to run for re-election.
And for more than 20 years, Terry and I have been friends, political allies, and colleagues
both in this house and on the Smirt City Council.
So in spite of what one may think, this was not a hard decision due to our friendship.
I know Terry well, and I know she will represent my hometown of Smurna and Cobb County with
integrity.
But for those who may not know, this was not my first time serving as a freshman in this
house.
It's been interesting because the freshman class I've come in with in the 2022 election
learned that I was not really a freshman, they kind of figured that out real quick.
And so they were very nice, they gave me the title of Dean of the freshman class, which
I thought was really nice.
No offense to Gerald Green, representative Green as Dean of this house, but they gave me
a dean of the freshman class, which I really appreciated that.
But to give you a little back, I was elected in the 2002 election and served as a member
of the majority under Speaker Terry Coleman in 2003 and 2004, which I know for some of
my colleagues on my side of the aisle, that's something they're not used to.
Obviously, I was very fortunate to serve in the majority and yes, I do miss being in
the majority.
I will not lie.
I do miss being the majority.
no offense, Mr. Speaker, or my colleagues across the aisle.
None, take it.
In fact, if I've got to serve in the minority,
I would serve a speaker of Burns, definitely,
is who I would want to serve within the majority,
and the minority.
In fact, several members of my first freshman class
are still serving this chamber today.
And Ralph, that speaker, Pro Tem Jan Jones,
we were freshmen.
Chairman Billy Mitchell, who's I don't think here,
but Billy Mitchell was also a Pete Marin,
a representative Debbie Buckner,
representative Al Williams,
representative Mary Margaret Oliver,
representative Roger Bruce,
representative Chuck Martin was a freshman with me.
And until recently,
representative Barry Fleming, now Judge Fleming.
And one other member who I was looking for
deserving with again,
and unfortunately could not,
and that was Speaker David Ralston,
who was a freshman with me in 2002.
Now, this is not the first time
Redistricting has impacted my service
in this legislature.
In fact, the Redistricting session of 2001
created a multi-member house district.
Some of you may remember those.
Multi-member house district
allowed me to run for the house in the first place.
Then at the beginning of the 2004 session,
I know members of my freshman class
definitely remember this.
The courts throughout our maps and drew new ones.
Those maps drew me into a house seat
with former representative of Rich Goldock.
A lot of y'all knew Rich.
And instead of running against my fellow house member,
I ran for the Senate against an incumbent senator
who I defeated in 2004.
Now, just to be honest, I'm a Democrat.
She was a Republican.
So I mean, I took out a Republican senator.
But hey, at least it was a senator.
It wasn't a house member.
So I looked at it.
I thought that was something.
And so I served for about another eight years in the Senate,
eventually becoming chairman of the Democratic Caucus
over in the Senate.
But again, redistricting in the 2011
redistricting session impacted my service
in this legislature.
And I was drawn into a 62% Republican performing
Senate district due to the courtesy of my friends
on the other side.
None of my friends here on the other side.
This was my friends over in the other chamber
on the other side.
And I will tell you, I always like a challenge.
Anybody knows me?
I like a challenge.
And yes, I did lose the contest in 2012,
but I'm a little proud only lost by four points.
52, 48, considering I was drawn
into a 62% Republican forming district.
But, you know, during my absence from this body,
I served on the Smarter City Council,
within my colleagues, Senator Council member,
I know it's.
And then in 2021, this body again drew new maps.
And I was fortunate enough to have an opportunity to return back to this chamber in the 2002
election.
Obviously, I'm here today giving this speech to the outcome of the latest redishting,
which by the way is the fifth one I have gone through in the last quarter century.
And I have to be honest, three have benefited me, two have not, so I'm just being honest
here and everything.
Now, you think by now I have to take a hint after all that's happened, which obviously
I can't take a hint, or that would either be bitter or cynical about my circumstances.
And I assure you I'm neither.
I'm neither one of those.
The reason I'm not is that I've always enjoyed public service in spite of all the challenges,
and we all know what the challenges are, everybody serves in this body.
And I get a deep satisfaction in helping my fellow Georgians while also improving in my
community improving my community and my state. Those who have worked with me over the years
no matter their political affiliation know that I enjoy building coalitions to solve problems.
This desire to be involved civically was both drilled into me and demonstrated at an early age
by my grandparents and parents. And why I say that is when your family owns a dairy queen in town,
which we still do own dairy queens, you have no choice but to be involved in your community,
because everybody wants to come to your dairy queen,
wants you to sponsor their sports team, or whatever it is.
I can tell you, I was very popular as a child in school
due to us owning the local dairy queen.
I can tell you that.
Everybody wanted to know, could I bring ice cream
to every school party or everything like that?
Oh, by the way, just not trying to.
Today's pie day, if y'all know, is 314, right?
And some of you may have noticed I had some pies over in the
cooler over here.
I had a son that said, do not touch, those were for some of the pages that we had that
were type one today.
Of course, they didn't need all the pie, so there's plenty of pie, by the way, if y'all
like, courtesy of Representative Stoner today, sitting over there in the anti-room, kind
of brings about my days of the dairy queen.
Not surprisingly, this background led me pursuing a political science degree in college, so I actually
did use my degree, which is not something everybody can say.
But my public service did not begin with elective office like many of you in this body.
I served as a local appointed public official first, which I did in a number of capacities
for 32 straight years from 1991 to 2023, while concurrently serving in elective office.
I was a vice chair of a development authority for 25 years, chairman of another authority,
and I was even chairman of the cop transit system at one time.
In the same time, I was also serving in public office, an elective office.
So no one needs to feel sorry for me and I don't think anybody here is without respect.
But as those of you who have known me over the years, I will continue public service in
another forum.
In fact, this morning when the governors were here, who I served with all three of those
governors, Senator, excuse me, a representative of Governor Campus, excuse me, mentioned
He mentioned, he says, I hear you're leaving, representative.
And I said, yeah, he says, I'm not worried.
You'll be back eventually.
I know you dug, which I appreciated that.
But I would conclude this farewell address,
or as I like to call it a farewell for now address, OK?
With a famous quote attributed to Hubert Humphrey,
former vice president of the United States,
that sums up how I kind of view my years of service.
I quote, once you get politics in the blood,
The only cure for it is in bombing fluid.
And I think a lot of us know folks, and I'll admit to be one of those folks, and my first
bullet campaign occurred when I was 13 years old, actually I worked on a campaign when
I was 13.
So at early age, and hopefully that cure is not any time soon, is the way I look at it.
And I want to thank Mr. Speaker and my colleagues here in the house.
I've enjoyed many years of service in both chambers
and have built a lot of friendships with a lot of individuals
who are serving now or served in the past.
But if my legislative service has to end now,
which again, I'm not saying it will, hopefully not.
But if it has to end now, I find it very appropriate
that I finish it in this house where I started
over 20 years ago.
And again, I thank y'all.
I know it's Thursday afternoon.
I'm not going to keep y'all here and everything,
but I just want to come and let you know my thoughts on this
and leaving.
And as I say, my farewell for now address and everything.
Thank y'all very much.
You've been a friend as I said for years, and I don't take that friendship lightly.
We've also been a fierce, fierce advocate for your district, and I can tell you as a
Georgian, I appreciate that.
We wish you the best, and somehow I think we'll see you again in some capacity.
You're quite resilient, and I think the reason you have that success is you care about
the people of Georgia, and you're a good man, and we appreciate you.
We're going to miss you.

House will come back to order we have one one more bill on the calendar.
One more bill.
Mr. Clerk will you read a caption to Senate bill 450 450 Senate bill 450 by Senator Kennedy
the 18th Strickland of the 17th tillery of the 19th Gutes of the 51st and
others. The title of an act of men, title of five, 15, 44 and 53 of the
fish quota, George Antady, relaying the PLAIR Courts property, Wilson Trust and
administration of the States. Miss Bill, I refer to the Committee on Judiciary.
That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute.
Members, if you'll please take your seats.
Chairman of Reapportionment, you'll look around us who's standing up so when things down that we'll could have a special session on Reapportionment
Members will please take your seats, give the gentleman in the will your attention
Representative Rob Leveritt is recognized to present the bill, Representative Leveritt
Thank you Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, I've been told by Chairman Collins that when
I get up to present some of my bills, it's so boring his heart rate slows to such a
level he can't hardly maintain consciousness so in the interest of public health I'll
try to be brief.
This bill amends the state and spirit court appellate practice act that we passed about
two years ago.
It made some changes in the way you appeal from like probate, magistrate, lower courts
up to a superior court.
They are normally a trial court, but they do have an appellate court function in that
case.
And we did that by doing away with the old petitioners there sure are in replacing it
with a petition for review, which is a much cleaner, simpler method of appeal.
Well, as often happens, there were some issues raised about really exciting things, like
standards of review, how you dismiss a petition when mutual consent is needed.
There were some changes also made to some of the condemnation statutes, which I don't
I think Vice Chairman Reeves, unfortunately he got chewed on pretty hard at the condemnation
seminar earlier this summer and we don't want that to happen to him again.
So we're trying just to clean up those issues, address some of those technical issues that
the bill raised.
I want to thank Vice Chairman Reeves again for bringing those provisions to my attention
and also so much thank the President of the Senate for allowing me to put those condemnation
provisions into Senate Bill 450.
And that, Mr. Speaker, is basically the bill.
Gentlemen, has no questions.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
I ask your favor, consideration, Senate Bill 450.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
The chair here is none, the previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute?
Chair here is none, the committee's substitute is adopted.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable
to the passage of the bill?
The chair here is none, and the report of the committee is agreed to.
Now this bill now pass, all in favor of the passage of the bill, we'll vote yes, all
those opposed, we'll vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine.
All members voted if so, the clerk will lock the machine.
On the passage of Senate Bill 450, the yeas are 150, the nays are zero.
Bill haven't received a requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed.
That completes the rules calendar.
We will move on to afternoon orders, Representative Tran.
If you will, give the gentleman in the way or your attention, Representative Tran.
He has some friends.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I rise today to remember what happened three years ago
on 316, but I'd actually would like to yield the well
to my colleague to say a few words about it.
You may.
Yes.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good afternoon.
Today marks the solemn remembrance of the third.
Member will stand, please.
Today marks the third anniversary of the devastating Asian spa shootings.
Three years ago, lives were tragically cut short, family shattered, and communities left
grieving in the wake of senseless violence.
We must remember the victims.
They had hopes, dreams, and loved ones who cherished them dearly.
Their lives mattered and their absence continues to leave an indelible void and the hearts
of many.
We also honor the survivors whose resilience in the face of unimaginable horror is a testament
to the strength of the human spirit.
Their stories remind us to support those in times of adversity.
As we reflect on this somber anniversary, let us recommit ourselves to combating the
deeply rooted prejudices and injustices that perpetuate violence against our communities.
We must stand united against hatred, bigotry, and discrimination.
Let this day serve as a reminder of the work that still lies ahead in creating a world
where every individual is valued, respected, and safe from harm.
May the memory of those lost inspire us to strive for a future filled with compassion and understanding.
Together, let us honor the victims, support the survivors, and work towards a brighter tomorrow.
Thank you.
I yield this well, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you, members.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen.
Good afternoon.
I want to come in some reading to you for over the weekend.
Perhaps on your drive home, this can be downloaded in an audio book, which is how I read
it.
But the zenith man written by a former member of this house, McCracken Poston, he represented
wringled Georgia when I was growing up, had an infamous race for Congress against then
Congressman Nathan Diel.
But this book is about a murder trial that took place in my hometown by an eccentric
of an eccentric television repair man, which is why this is called the zenith man.
But it's a great story of how we can misunderstand people that are different from us.
the story of redemption and the justice system working, and also there's some great stories
for anyone who's lost a political race. You'll enjoy reading this, but I commend to you,
the zenith man. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representative Evans. That completes
