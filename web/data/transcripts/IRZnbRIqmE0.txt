We're already a minute late, we'll have an invocation first and I'm going to ask our
Senator Billy Hickman to do that for us if you could, your mic 6 I believe there.
Yeah, thank you.
Let us pray.
Lord God, what a great day you're giving us.
Lord, you're giving us another day too.
Todd, are you lowering your vote?
You're giving us another day to work for the great citizen of Georgia.
Lord, we just ask you to guide us and direct us through our thoughts and your son's name
Sunday, Muppery. Amen. Alright, we've got a bill that had passed out last year that
died on the floor and the Honorable House member has come back to represent it to the
committee again. We've got some date changes we need to make on it if the committee does
decide to pass it out again. The fiscal note from last year is in the folder as well.
And we had some copies that got left on stairs, but I think they're arriving now.
And we've got a couple of new people, too.
We should probably introduce.
We've got a new-ledged council, lost our wake forest lawyer, Blake Travis, to private industry,
as so happens with several that we've had if you want to stand up and introduce yourself.
if you can come to the mic here where I can hear you.
Hello, I am Christy Farhudi,
and I will be helping out this session.
All right.
And then I interned this year
if you want to come and introduce yourself.
Hey, how's it going guys?
My name is Pedro Simano.
I'll be working with Senator Houghseller this upcoming session.
I'd tell him your major is at Georgia State.
Georgia State, senior, and I am majoring in finance
with a minor in computer information systems.
So I think all the other players are from here before last year, so that's all new players.
So with that, if you want to give us a brief presentation of your bill, or if the committee
needs to hear it again asking questions, go ahead with us your mic's up now.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and to members of the committee, thank you for allowing me the
chance to come back before you for Senate substitute on House Bill 82.
As you can remember, this bill was passed out of this committee on last session and it
got to the floor but did not get a hearing on the floor before the clock ran out on us.
This is a rural physician tax credit bill that will allow us to incentivize recruitment
of medical students to our rural communities and also to keep physicians in our rural communities.
It also includes dentuses in rural communities as well as positions.
This bill was worked on through your committee last year.
Some changes were made and we were in agreement with those changes that were made through this
committee but we just didn't get enough time to get it across the finish line before the
clock struck 12 on Sandy die of 2023.
But it's the same bill that you worked on.
We believe that you did some good changes on this bill and made it so that it's a really
good beat.
But thank you for all the work that you did on it.
All right.
And I will add that a few years ago we did a few bills after the clock struck 12.
So that doesn't always mean anything around here depending on the rules.
All right.
from the committee on the bill again this was passed out before, the fiscal impact is fairly minimal, Senator Bates.
Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
On the rural county, I guess it says on the line 16 through 19 talking about 65 persons per square mile.
And that's from the census of 1990?
Yes, sir.
Okay, because I mean, some of these communities
with all the economic development projects we've announced
are not going to be rural forever.
I mean, they're going to be growing
with the Hyundai plant, all these plants
that are being built, all Rivian and so on.
But this is all based on 1990 data.
Does it get updated to 20 data or anything?
Are we going to just still stay at 1990 data?
Well, when we talked about change,
the changes that wasn't included in it,
it was stealing just a 1990 data.
Yeah, I'm fully supportive because we need
to have doctors in rural Georgia.
Yes, sir.
But I just want to make sure that if they grow,
they can continue to get that tax credit.
Even if they go over 100 beds, if they get CON
and want to add to the hospital,
I still want them to get their tax credit.
Sure, we'll be agreeable to that if the committee sees fit.
Okay, thank you.
Last chair, Albers.
Yeah, Senator Beach, I think brings up a good point.
It does say, in any future such census,
but it does make sense.
Why would we not be at the 2020 census not 30 years old?
It seems like a logical amendment,
if the author were to be amenable to it.
I'm very much agreeable to it, Senator.
Thank you.
Okay, well, we've got, don't see any other questions.
We've got some amendments related white.
There's a, I believe that's our chair of appropriations.
Senator Mike.
Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman.
I think it does say that.
If you're looking at line 50, it says
any future census. So tell me if I'm wrong on there. And then if you also look back at line
17, not the, this, this the end, I can't even say that word, 1990 or any future census.
So you'll tell me if you still think it's needed. My question, I have two of them. One, I do see the
standard repeal section in 2028, which will be a five year four year sunset on line 39.
But that's only as the section one, the policy of this committee has been to set a sunset
on all tax credits.
I don't know that we have one on this one, which while we may be okay with this policy,
I do think having that sunset allows us to revisit things like Senator Beach brought
up today if we did not have that future census language.
It's a reason to come back to the table and look at those things.
The second is, that's my first question, the sunset.
The second is why I don't know that I completely right now, I'm asking for someone who can
read faster than me, to tell me I understand we're adding dentists, but I don't understand
how this changes the tax credit that was already in code in section one.
Does anybody, because if you're in section one start like line 25, it's $5,000 tax credit
for five years, it can't be used against,
can't exceed the taxpayers income liability.
If I flip the section two, well, first of all,
at the bottom of that, section one's repealed in 2028.
In section two, we add Dennis's physician.
Looks like they're named the same.
Maybe there's a change in definition there.
And it's a $5,000 credit for every 12-month period,
not to exceed five years.
So I'm just wondering, is this all that's doing
is adding dentist, or is there something more to it
than I'm missing?
Let you answer that.
The only two occupations we talked about
with Dennis and the doctors, the physicians.
So the question is, is this just adding dentist
or to this, or have we done something else?
Just adding dentists, too.
Okay.
All right, and I think it is a good point that we do we routinely put
sunsets on everything just because they may be great. We still like to look at
them on a periodic basis and make sure that the world hadn't changed. Okay, so we
we do want to do that. I think it's a committee process.
Mr. Chairman cannot say something else. It looks like the definition of rural
county at spans, including military bases and installations, which I don't
that's necessarily a problem, but I'm just wondering why if it was as easy as adding
dentists, why would we write a new code section, why would we not just come in in what was
old section one and add dentist. Okay well we're in the what was that you
want to add this uh well we were the discussion of the committee was about the
sunset of adding that but I'll leave that to the committee so we we've got the
sunset we've got some dates that need changing okay and I'm not sure if our
chair of appropriations had another thing you wanted to change in there as well okay okay all right
um do you have a okay go ahead see the rest of us I did miss German um and just to piggyback off
the appropriations job is I'm curious just because it does seem like it's two different programs
and I just wanted to make sure that my understanding of of the bill was correct is this two different
tax credits? No it was never meant to be two different tax credits just the same
tax credit and we added dentists in there. Okay because there are some
differences between the two the two sections the new section has not only
redefines rural county but it also adds a cap of $2 million to the to the
tax credit which I did not see in section one and then there's some other
restrictions here. I mean I generally okay with it I just pointing it it
seems like two different programs. Okay yeah. I've got some concerns from
several people we may have to bring you back I apologize for that but we want
to ask this out with alleged counsel make sure everybody's good on this this
is what we passed out last year but there's some concern that maybe we
We shouldn't have passed it out in this form last year, so we'll visit on this again on that.
Thank you, Ms. Chairman.
So the second bill we have today, I'm the sponsor of, so I'm going to go get in the hot
seat and let Vice Chairman Albers take over here.
And I will say this is a hearing only today on this bill.
we're just starting the process.
All right, Mr. Chairman, we've got Senate Bill 349.
Make sure we have the right LC, 432939.
Is that correct?
All right.
Hold my notes up here, yet.
And that's correct.
Wonderful.
All right.
Take it away.
All right.
Well, we've probably all heard more about property taxes and any other issue in the last
year and it's been an issue for many years.
I know I dealt with it on the County Commission for eight years and had actually put in for
the county in 2002 a homestead property freeze which is still in effect and the county
has still survived and thrived with it.
I believe our chairman appropriations did the same when he was on the County Commission.
And in fact, there are 39 Georgia counties, 35 cities, and 27 school systems that have
some sort of a local all-limiting assess value.
So what this bill does is it addresses several issues.
One is the escalating value.
We've seen property tax increases due to just solely assess value on homeowners of 25,
even 40% on the bill and so this addresses this by saying there can only be a
3% cap on this assessment increase by floating homestead same as we've done
on the freezes it can only go up by 3%. Some other things it does for the local
governments is as long as you don't increase above that cap your
millage rate and you stay within that cap, you don't have to
advertise the tax increase anymore that they advertise so
that these can be very confusing to people to have these
advertised. Another issue is the estimated tax number on the
bill. It quite often does not contain, for instance, the $500
the state put in there. Many of the exemptions that are in there, it's never a right number.
It's always wrong and it really stores people up. And so this wrong number would not be
on there anymore because it's totally incorrect number. And then a third issue has to do
with appeals. We've had many people that in my opinion have gained the system. They have
a tax appeal that puts their value at 85% and then they don't show up for the hearings
and it just stays frozen at 85% and it stays frozen and they just never show up for the appeals
so this can go over years and so what this says is you do still go to the 85% if you appeal
but if you don't show up for a hearing you don't get to keep the 85%.
The advantage to the tax assessors in this is the tax assessors quite often are in a
catch-22, I guess you might say.
They can raise the value of what they should put it at, the most accurate number, and
the whole community is mad at them.
They can not raise it up, and they don't meet the digest.
We tax on 40% of the value.
If you don't hit 36 to 44% the Department of Revenue says you're out of compliance and
as a matter of fact, 33 counties right now are out of compliance according to the report.
I received on Saturday from the Department of Revenue and so you either pay a penalty
for not being in compliance or you make everybody mad.
That's the tax assessor's life.
This would say you can raise it what you think is accurate but the taxes are only going
to go up for the homeowners on that 3% maximum level that you could do. That is the essence
of the bill. There's some other things that we need to make sure in this process that
we take care of that those that have freezes will stay in place. I want to double clarify
the language after this hearing. And I think there's been possibly an issue where the
the Digest is now projected now instead of what used to be and this Senator Chip Rogers
did a rewrite in 2010 of the property tax and some of this came about from then but we
just had a lot of recession times and people wanted to make sure that their house changed
and value quicker.
Well, it's also made it change quicker going the other way and it's using numbers that
are projected to my understanding that are hard to deal with so those are some of the
issues we want to address in this and I can certainly go through different line numbers
with the committee and hear your questions at this time.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
This is a great bill and I would just say that this is definitely in need.
People throughout the state have felt a lot of pain here.
You know, similar to what you and Chairman Tillery did, Senator Beach and I did this
several years ago for North Fulton County along with our colleagues in the
house. We reset all the values to the lowest amount they were in the years
2016-17-18 and then did a 3% cap or the CPI whichever was lower and that has
really helped our homeers because a lot of them now would have a hundred or
200% increase and we would attack people out of their house. Hopefully this
will help the entire system. I've got a similar bill that I know we're
working on but I applaud you for bringing this forward as well as I think
I think if I understand in your bill, you're also giving some relief to the local governing
bodies if they keep that increase of 3% or less and they wouldn't have to go through
the normal process of showing that they're going to have a tax increase.
Is that correct?
Correct.
All right.
I've got a question.
I believe that Senator Dole's always at your light.
Yes, Mr. Chairman, number 11.
I've got a couple questions if it's okay.
First of all, similar to Chairman Alvers
that we passed in Forsyth County
we'll have on the ballot this year a cap
on floating homestead exemptions
for the school portion of the tax at 4%.
I'm happy to see that move to three.
I believe you references just want to clarify it.
Forsyth County on the County MNO currently has
a floating homestead of 0%.
So once you're locked in, it's locked
until you sell the home.
And that is your intention to ensure that that stays it.
We're going to clarify the language and make sure that is part of the bill.
We of course had Blake Travis dig this to begin with and that was the intention he had
and of course he left us so I want to make sure with current ledge counsel that that's
in place of the bill.
I just want to flag a couple of thoughts for you if I can as you continue to work on this.
Currently I believe state law requires that if you win an appeal, your value is locked,
or assess value is locked at that value
that it was appealed at for three years.
I want to ensure that that remains the case.
I haven't heard as much of the gamesmanship
around the 85%.
I thought you still had to eventually re-ups.
I'm happy to hear you close that loophole.
There's no reason, apart from the anomaly of last year
of us doing the $500 homeowner's tax refund,
there's no reason why the estimates should be wrong.
And so I would rather see us figure out a way, figure out why they're wrong and clean
that up, then getting rid of them all together.
Because the second thing that I would add is that this bill deals with homeowners claiming
a homestead exemption.
But it's not going to do anything for anyone who owns commercial property taxes or anyone
who either owns a home for rent or it's a second home.
And to the extent that those people will still continue to see backdoor increases via assessment
increases.
I still want to keep that accountability
on the local government where they do have to
essentially advertise a property tax increase
if they do not do a rollback.
I want to keep the pressure on to do rollbacks
I think goes away a little bit.
So I would just like to ask you to consider that.
And then lastly, I'm wondering for the base year,
do you just capture the previous year?
And do we want to look at something
like what Jeremy Alverson beach did
where it captured over a period of time,
either a lower value or average value because we've seen in some areas, I think, as much
as 50 percent increases on assessed values over the last three years.
But I applaud you for this bill in general.
I think that it's overdue and certainly supportive of a constant.
And again, I'm trying to work out a reasonable compromise that would limit the values but would
also pass.
And so I'm certainly open to any suggestions in that area.
And I did drop a bill today that would reset it to the lowest value between 2020, 2021 and
22 that we'll probably discuss at a future meeting.
Okay, I got a question.
Oh, Senator Terri, are you still looking for a question?
A question.
All right, go ahead.
Thank you, Senator Hoesteller.
I'm Senator Albers.
Oh, Mr. Chairman, the question I have is I'm looking at the definition of adjusted base
value.
And I understand it can increase by 3%.
What happens if I take my house that's 2,000 square feet and I push out the back and
I add 2,000 more square feet?
Is the local taxing authority locked to only raise my assessment by 3 percent?
That's what I believe we have in the bill and I'll have to look for the line number, but
that if you put on a $50,000 edition that it would go up 50,000, it wouldn't as well
currently as the law in some places where they go reevaluate the whole piece of property,
it would only go up by the addition that you put on there.
Okay.
And I believe that's part of the challenge that exists in the property tax today.
You know, let's say you redo model the kitchen in your house.
So you're not adding to the structure.
You pull all the permits, you do all the right things, then your house gets re-evaluated
at $50,000 or $100,000 more.
Well, there's no additional cost to the city, the county, the schools.
So you actually, today we're penalizing people for improving their home.
I understand if you built a 2000 square foot addition, because then that might require
more services in order to service your house in the time of need, but we have to come
over the better solution there.
Other questions?
Questions from Senator Oroch?
Go ahead.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Senator Huffsettler, there's been a lot of concern that the commercial properties in
my county are being grossly undervalued and under-taxed and more the tax burden being
put on the residential owners.
Is that something that you have any familiarity with in general or in particular?
I've heard those stories as not in my district, so I haven't really looked at it a lot, but
I've heard evidence from people that said that they're being undervalued.
Well, yeah, it would be a strict contradiction to what the property, the transfer of the
property and a new owner, whatever, what they paid would just not be grossly undervalued
when there was public knowledge and public record about how much the property costs
want to change hands and you know it would seem that all of that push the tax burden
more and more on residential as opposed to commercial is the problem to me and that's
just something I'd like to hear more from you on going forward you know my my intent
of this bill is to protect people who want to stay in their home right right off when
a retired and fixed income and not be subject to massive tax increases that they have.
And so Florida did this same thing and actually used 3% in their bill as well.
And we're trying to protect people who, you know, don't want to get taxed out of their
home.
concern across my county. Thank you. Senator Estevez.
I echo my colleague from the 36th concerned about commercial properties and what we can
do to give counties the tools to appropriately adjudicate those appeals. One of the things
that I appreciate about this bill, Mr. Chairman,
is the fact that by alleviating the county's
docket related to homes that have property appeals,
you're actually allowing them to use those resources
to then focus more on commercial appeals.
Because right now, there's a lot of time
split between residential appeals and commercial appeals
by by cleaning up this process a bit it would allow our counties to focus more on those
commercial properties which take up a significant amount more resources.
I also appreciate and wanted to ask you, well not even ask you, I also appreciate the
The fact that it does allow local municipalities in counties to not be distracted by the rollback
advertisements, which as a former local government official, found always be deceiving.
And as several of us have talked about, not necessarily required by other entities, including
the state of Georgia when the state of Georgia does not roll back its taxes.
So appreciate that we're going back to where we should be, which is focused on not confusing
taxpayers and being transparent with taxpayers on where their taxes are going.
Any other questions from the committee members?
Seeing none, we've got four people signed up to speak.
First one, no stranger to this committee.
Dante, would you like to come up from ACCG and sit next to the chairman?
Good afternoon, chairman Alvers, members of the finance committee.
Wanted to express ACCG support for the the package that is in Senate bill 349
I think will make a lot of very positive changes
Questions for ACCG
That was great. Thank you
See if everybody can follow your same suit here next from GSBA Justin Panley come on forward
Thank you Chairman committee thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today just have a few
comments around the bill so just going to read a couple of notes here. We recognize and understand
the issues that this bill is addressing as do our membership. Many school districts have taken steps
to ease the burden on their constituents as local homestead exemptions have been created
based on age and income. In 2023, 110 districts decreased their
millage rates, 57 held them in place with no change and only 13 increased their millage
mostly by less than half a point. There have been a good, good faith effort to adjust
these rates, taking into consideration the increased rates of inflation, which increases
the cost of doing business. We would respectfully request a fiscal note to be done to look at the
impact on the school districts, counties, and cities as well as the state. Although the state does
not collect ad-balarm taxes, the property tax digest impacts state funding in the QBE formula
and the calculation for the five mil-share deduction and equalization. We appreciate most of the bill
and what it addresses but do have concerns around the statewide floating tax exemption
which caps property tax at 3%.
School districts are constitutionally capped at 20 mils.
Districts whose digest is largely residential would be particularly hard hit.
It would create a system in which places more of the responsibility for funding local
services on new property owners if prices are rising and on local business owners.
This could impact some economic development efforts.
will not always continue to increase as they have in the last few years.
The housing market will slow at some point and we just thank the opportunity to address
the committee.
Thank you.
You've got a question, Justin, from Senator Dole's all.
Thank you.
You mentioned 110 did rollbacks.
What was the approximate size of a typical rollback?
My understanding was that most of them were less than a quarter of a percent and that there
was only one that was over a quarter mill rollback, is that accurate?
We do have the report.
I don't know the numbers right off the top of my head.
I get a copy that I'd love to see that.
Thank you so much.
And once you send that to the committee
and we can distribute it out to Diego here.
So got the report from the Department of Revenue
that we give the same numbers.
I'll get that to the committee as well.
Got a question from Senator Tillery.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I'm wondering how you would set up a fiscal note
because the fiscal note would have to,
would the revenue would be, I guess you would assume
it's neutral unless the commission or the Board of Education is raising the
millage rate. So without knowing how much they're going to raise the millage
rate, I'm not sure how we could factor in what a physical note is going to show
you zero.
I don't have an answer to your question. I'm sorry, but I can definitely look
to it for you. If I could add, I'm working with Department of Physical Audits on that
very issue to see if there is any physical impact to GBE formula or something. So we were
that was brought up and so we decided we needed to address that.
Other questions for Justin. Thank you for your testimony.
Thank you.
Steve Swindell, come on down.
Thank you Mr. Chairman this is what a mind be nice to him now I'm I'm the Cherokee County
chief of Fraser and I serve as the legislative director for our tax assessor group in
the state and I'm just here to let y'all know that we are neutral on this bill as the
tax assessors of the state on a whole, speaking on behalf of Cherokee County, my only caution
is that we are a county that has a floating homestead, and it does get a little dicey
explaining to taxpayers how the whole process works, and this would complicate that process
to a certain extent, I believe it has the potential to, but other than that, we're okay.
Can I ask a question?
Of course, Mr. Chairman, go ahead.
Your floating home state exemption is that a freeze, a 3% camp?
How does that work?
It's a freeze on the county M&O, and then two of the cities have it too.
So it would cause us, in this case, I believe to maintain a second base rate,
obviously, of this passes, and then adjust above the percentage of,
three percent or less whatever whatever it's less I mean we can do it so the
same in my county we've got a freeze on the city in the county not on the
schools so they've got that freeze they keep employees the schools are
different so it's still gonna be two numbers I think I think the mass workable
there okay you got another question from Senator Beach thank you for being
here and I represent part of Cherokee County. Can you tell us how many
your appeals have they went up in the past? This past tax? Yes sir. Somebody
mentioned earlier that the whole deal about property values increasing,
digest increasing, and tax assessors still being caught failing in their
audit and that is what happened in Cherokee this year. We've had massive
increases, tried to keep up with the market. Our numbers look good. The state says
as they don't, but yeah, we had a massive increase
in appeals this year.
Can you tell us how much?
Yeah, we typically average about 3,000 a year
and jump to 8,500 this year.
I mean, that's a big increase now,
and don't get offended by this,
but that tells me, I don't know how you assess the property,
but somebody's assessing it wrong
if you have that many appeals in the citizens' mind.
They think it's too much.
I'm just not, I will tell you, I think property tax is one of the most regressive taxes we have.
And I want to just give you my personal example.
I've been in the same house for 31 years.
I paid $169,000 for that house in Alphoretta.
Today, I mean, my last assessment was at $885,000.
Now I'm glad it's went up in value, but I haven't put $716,000 worth of improvements in that house.
And I haven't realized the game.
I think it should almost be like when you sell stock.
You don't pay the capital gains tax to you sell the stock.
And I just think we're hurting people.
We're forcing people out of their houses.
And I just have a problem with that.
I think there's got to.
So I want to thank Chairman Huffstellar for least bringing
this to where we have a 3% cap.
We just need to be careful because some of these people
aren't going to be able to stay in their houses.
And I just kind of wanted to get that off my chest a little bit.
I didn't really have a question as much as I'm worried about.
You know, I guess my other question is how does the tax assessor value the property?
Do they go on Zillow? How does that work?
It's an ad valorem. It's according to value.
We look at all the deeded transactions that occur in the county for a given year.
And adjust our values to the deeded prices as closely as we can.
and then have to adjust everybody else accordingly.
So this year we had about, for 2023,
we had about 6,000 qualified deeds that we looked at
and made those adjustments based on those deeds
and we do it every year,
just trying to adjust to those values
from that prior year deed cash A.
And it's gotten to the point where the market
in these last few years, I will say,
adjusted so rapidly that from the beginning of the year deeds in January versus
deeds in December, you might have a particular neighborhood where the
values jumped $100,000 on the same house in that 12-month span. So trying to get
our values in line with any kind of accuracy, you know, we end up having to
focus more at the end of the year and things that we're just not really
comfortable or accustomed to doing, and the state on the flip side, on the Department
of Audit side, hasn't really been a friend to us either, because they're focusing on January
1st only, and they want us to adjust our values to January 1st.
And if we did that, I think we'd have had substantially more than 8,500 appeals.
No.
Well, I didn't mean anything about that.
I just when you have that kind of jumping appeals people something happened you follow me and and I'm look
I hope I can sell my house for 885 when I bought it for 169 and then I'll be a happy camper
But right now, I'm not I'm just making the point that I haven't put
$700,000 worth of improvements in the house to be taxed on in my opinion. I understand you
If I could ask one question of him always up here too you talked about the January first date
I've been told that it wasn't always that way
on January 1st that you're used to not have to project forward as a tax
assessor. You may not have been in it before 2010, but I've been in since
95. But yeah, it's always been January 1st is the date of appraisal in
Georgia, but you could count on the market being slow enough that, you know, if
you saw a three to four percent expansion and market over the course of a
year, you could target kind of a middle of the year number. So you'd end up with
an overall ratio that would be around July somewhere,
but you wouldn't be that far out of whack
by the end of the year.
Well, in this market, we end up being way out of whack
by the end of the year.
So we've had to change the way we do things.
So you're doing assessments all year long.
They're asking us to trend.
If we had to sail in February, they're saying,
well, trend that value to January 1st.
OK.
That's where the problem is.
Those people that bought in February and March are, that's going to be a problem.
Okay.
I think we all agreed, AIMN to what Senator Beach said, none of it really makes sense.
They dropped in 2009 like a rock, right, and then they came up their houses worth exactly
what one person's willing to pay for at any given day.
And that's why I bought Senator Huff's cellware for the work he's doing.
Senator Teller, did you have a question still or did you turn your light off?
I'm just picking off your expertise here.
In Georgia, we have this weird system where we tax on 40% of the full value.
Why would we, it would change practically nothing to tax on 100% of the value.
You could totally just drop the millage rate accordingly and get that exact same number.
Is there a reason to do that?
And does your office, if we were to make that change in the middle of these other changes,
would it save you any time or create any efficiency for you?
I think that it would create a tremendous amount of transparency with the taxpayers.
I do applaud that effort.
However, I think the major stumbling block seems to be according to the legal scholars
that I've consulted about this, the constitutional local amendments for homestead exemptions.
Those are all set at a value and that value is based on the 40 percent and you can't just
I don't believe you can even just legislate that correction
to multiply by 2.5.
I think it would have to go back to the voters,
and you're talking about hundreds and hundreds
of those exemptions that exist out there.
So I think that that's really the hold up.
And as far as the code section goes,
I don't know that it would be that dramatic to change it.
There's not that many places.
I mean, there probably are that we don't know about,
but we'd rely on you all to find those places
that it exists, but from a tax assessment standpoint,
how long for it?
We have to answer that question a lot.
The reason for it, I've been told,
was years ago, before really any attention was paid
to fair market value and keeping up with fair market value,
people just returned their value
to the tax assessor's officer to the county,
And typically they'd returned it at about 40% value.
So then the state came in and said,
now we've got to stop that.
Everybody's got to get up to fair market value.
We've got to do what's right.
So they forced the revaluation way back when.
And it turned out that there was that difference.
So they said, all right, we're going to assess everybody
at 40, but the values are going to be at 100.
That could be a lifestyle.
I don't know.
I've never heard it expressed any other way but that.
but that's my understanding of how that came to be.
Thank you.
As always, you are a wealth of knowledge, Steve.
Thank you.
Are there other questions?
I saw some lights go on and some lights go off.
Seeing none, thank you.
Thank you, Chairman.
All right.
Last person signed up to talk.
Suzanne.
Good afternoon.
Thank you all for having me.
I am Suzanne Whiteenhouse.
the chief appraiser of Muscogee County and I was asked to come to talk about homestead
freezes and their effect historically because Muscogee County has the longest homestead
freeze in existence in the state of Georgia.
ours was implemented it was enacted in 82 and implemented in 83 now we are a consolidated
government, so it's Columbus, Muscogee County, and our homestead freeze is a zero percent.
In other words, there is no inflationary aspect to our homestead freeze.
You lock in, you lock in.
And we have a lot of history to talk about what that does over the course of time.
And there are implications to freezes that have zero percent increases built into them
or three percent or five percent or ten percent just depends.
RZZ is zero percent.
And what that has done is that has shifted our tax burden.
It's the newcomers tax basically.
It has shifted that tax burden to our businesses and to new businesses coming into town and
to non-home-steaded properties
and folks who buy their property.
And I've got a really good example.
I've got a house in our historic neighborhood
of Uptown in Columbus that was homesteaded in the early 80s.
Right around the corner is another house that's
almost identical that was homesteaded in the 2018-2019
somewhere in there.
Both of them valued right about $300,000.
One pays $7 and 19 cents in tax.
And the other tax bill is over $3,000.
And this is what happens.
So when you talk about an inflationary cap of 3%,
that's great because it allows for some resets.
But you need to be aware if you look at the history
of values over the course of time here in the state of Georgia.
And I kind of took it back to about 1980 thereabouts.
You're going to find that your increases
are 4.39% on average.
That takes into consideration the downturn
that we had the little downturn we had in the 90s.
And then again, in 2008 when we had the big downturn,
and then it takes into consideration
the hyperinflation that we have seen in 2021-22 timeframe.
So you're averaging about 4.39% what's that mean?
If you cap at 3%, you're not going to keep up.
Now, it took 10 years in Muscogee County
before they realized, whoops, we made a mistake.
And they tried to roll it back.
They tried to repeal that freeze
and put something different into place.
And they couldn't claw it back.
Once it's in place, it's impossible to claw back.
So I'm here.
They asked me to come to talk about what this means historically.
And so I would just caution that any kind of inflationary increase that's put into place,
you take into consideration the history because what you don't want to happen is what's
happened in Muscogee County, which is the fact that we have a great workforce, we have
a great school system, we have a great community, we have lovely river access, we are the
Savannah of the West, we are a great community and we struggle to bring businesses in because
we have shifted our tax burden.
The freeze cost us about $56 million in tax revenue
that had to come from somewhere else
because the county's not spending less.
They're still going to provide all of the wonderful services
that we enjoy.
Somebody has to pay for those.
So that's $56 million that was shifted over
to non-home-steaded and businesses.
And what happens is in order to encourage new businesses
to come. We have to then offer greater exemptions and all of that. So now we're going to penalize
our existing businesses. Very comparable county that does not have our homestead phrase.
Still has military base, still has a river, borders another state that has good industry
to it, lots of hospitals. So we've got everything kind of similar. I don't know if any of you
have guessed, I'm talking about Augusta Richmond County, another consolidated government. We're
about the same size. We are a couple thousand people, a couple thousand citizens apart size-wise.
They are so much larger than we are because they've been able to draw businesses to them,
because they have a lower military, they have a lower sales tax rate. We have had to put all
of this in place to make up for the differences that our freeze has caused, the shifting of the
the tax burden to the businesses that we need to come to us.
So that is the one thing I would caution.
There's lots of great stuff in this bill
that I really, really like.
And I, as a fellow chief appraiser with Mr. Swindell back
there, we really do appreciate the focus
that has been on the tax assessor's office
and trying to clarify for the taxpayer.
And it does get very confusing for the taxpayer.
I would, I have some concerns about how this is gonna work
with the 3% versus what we already have in place.
ours effects, our school already,
so we don't have that, we don't have that burden there.
But this has the ability to adjust back
if there's a downturn,
whereas the one in Muscogee County cannot adjust downward
for a downturn in the market.
So our folks that locked in in 2008
and then the market tanked in 2009,
It took them, some of them all the way up until 2020-2021
to actually come back even and then surpass
to get the benefit because our freeze
didn't have that in place.
Thank you, Susanna.
A question for you.
You're using that 4% plus number.
It was out basically because the increase
of the inflationary costs over that time, over those years.
So that is, that's an indexed adjustment
that they, that, you know, if you look at Fred,
I love Fred, Fred's a great resource.
And that's where I get that number from.
For the state of Georgia, that 4.39% average
is a seasonally adjusted increase in value
over a historic period of time.
So that increase in value, of course,
is an inflationary increase.
That's not because of new construction.
That's the increase in value.
OK.
I just wondering how that gets skewed, as you mentioned,
when we have big downturns and extraordinary upturns.
Again, this is, I think, part of the challenge for everybody.
As an example, last year, you know, the Fred shows a year
over year, third quarter, 23 to third quarter, 22
of a 7% increase.
This last quarter was about a 2% increase.
So that's, gets averaged in with that huge downturn
that we had in 2000 and, you know, nine time frame
to work out to over the course of a 40, 45 year period,
4.39%.
It's a long picture.
Absolutely, I got a question from Chairman Hofstelver.
I was just going to say this, fortunately or unfortunately,
however you want to look at it, will not have any impact
on your county because you've got a freeze in place.
It will continue to stay in place.
And so there'll be no mechanisms to do it all
for your particular county.
Now, I understand on the freeze what you're saying,
and this does have 3%.
I lived out in California five years, believe it or not.
Glad you escaped, Mr. Chairman.
they said you can never leave but somehow I got out but anyway I went under
there under Prop 13 and there's been good and bad things from that and people
when I got there said you know your neighbor may be paying half the property tax
as you are are you happy with that and I said what I'm happy with is that mine
are not going to go up and so that was my point of view in my county we put in
and again this is a 3% increase but we put in a freeze for the city in the
county in 2002. I think the county has done fine. I think they've functioned very well
there. Business has not been chased away just in the last month. Microsoft said they're
putting a billion dollar data center in our county and they're not, we're not giving
it away to them. They're paying their taxes and all their school taxes, everything from
day one. So we're attracting business and I think that that's not going to be an issue
With a three percent increase on this because I've seen it with a freeze work well, too
Thank you. You got a question from Senator Dole's all
Thank you. Thank you for being here today
How much is the county military gone up in the last five years?
Our military it's actually fairly stable
We fairly stable or zero zero increase. No, you know, there's been there's been a bit of an increase
Okay, use some of those numbers.
23, it dropped a little bit.
Let me see if I have those numbers.
23, we did drop just a little bit,
because we did that increase in the digest
when we did a revaluation.
I'm looking to see if I have those,
the milled change in milled trades.
So, and what they did was they shifted
our milledrate a little bit to put more towards debt service so they that's
why I say they you know we've had some some tweaks to it over the course of
history that we've had this freeze into place our milledrate started out in
the in the you know somewhere in the 29 range I was just talking about the
county the county milledrate you know what that is County MMO our county
Because bond service, maybe this is important for the committee, for those that haven't dove into this yet.
The bond service, the reason you're shifting to that, that's not subject to these floating hubs, that exemption.
So, all of the bond.
So, here in Muscogee County, it does affect it.
So, you're doing remilitarate rollbacks on the bond service, this bill does not do that.
So, the Muscogee County freeze, just as an example, the frozen value does affect how much you pay on the bonds.
you just don't get the homestead deduction, the 2000,
that the state allows you the 11,000 and five,
but you do get that frozen value up against the military.
You guys have a population of about 205,000.
So we're in there, yeah?
I'm in first side, which is about 250,000.
We've had a 0% cap since 2000.
So not quite as long as y'all, but for a long time.
And it's had zero impact on economic development.
In fact, we're in the counties and negotiations right now to bring an NHL hockey team to the county.
And that has just really not been a factor where there's been for data center sites and
industrial sites where the fastest growing county and the state have been for over a decade.
And that's been with this freeze in place.
You said something that makes me tick a little bit.
And that is that the counties have no other option.
They essentially have to collect it from the commercial taxpayers.
And I just disagree with that.
Last year, in Forsyfe County, our school superintendent
presented a budget that would have assumed
the full military at 17.3 mils that our current milledrate
is at, and there was outcry from the community,
and the school board was able to do a full two-million
rollback, which is the largest rollback in the state,
and they were able to subtract $60 million.
Otherwise, we've just been spent by government.
So I think that what the chairman is trying to do
just to either make the county or the school board go to the
citizens and argue as to why they need to spend more money.
And the tool that they have to do that is a milling increase.
And the reality is, is that these counties and school boards
have been raising taxes on their citizens,
maybe not in the scogies you've had the freeze,
but all over the state of Georgia,
without even having to raise the military,
and they just get to blame not the property tax assessments.
I think that what we see is that citizens,
when they know that their money is going to good use
are willing to invest in government.
But the elected officials have to be the ones to do it,
not just some sort of, like Chairman Beach said,
it attacks on unrealized gain.
Because we are taxing people out of their homes in the state.
And we have heard it from all over the state.
And so your local delegation can remove the 0% rate
of the cap if they wanted to, but they haven't been compelled
to do that.
So that was a-
They have tried.
We've tried multiple times.
it's a constitutional amendment,
and the voters have voted it down twice now.
Well, it's not like it's a local referendum.
And so what you're saying is,
so your voters like that this is in place,
it's not damaging the economic development
in the county so much that they've...
So, well, I can tell you,
overall growth in the state has been about 21%.
Is, you know, that was a 22 number.
The growth in 22 was about 21%.
The state-wise.
Statewide growth, just overall growth in dollars investment, all of that, it was about
a 21 percent growth in investment, across the state of Georgia, those are-
Government budget, I'm not sure what you're referencing.
So that's growth as far as new construction and I look at things from what's getting built.
So that was like, there was a 21% increase
across the state in investment into building infrastructure
and buildings and houses and schools and all of that,
21% in Muscogee County, we were at eight.
So.
And your position is at the sole reason for that
if it's you all has.
He's one of the reasons, it's not the only reason,
but it's one of the reasons.
It's a predominant reason in Europe in your opinion.
Yeah, because we have one of the highest milligrates
in the state.
It's 23.321.
Excuse me.
How do you juxtapose that with what I just told you that the fastest growing county
in the state also has the same cap that you're talking about?
So what I can tell you is that you've had it in place for 20 years.
We've had it in place for well over 40.
And we see the trend.
And it's a long term trend.
And all I can say is I hope that I hope that Forsythe County continues to be successful
I know the challenges that Muscogee County has faced and some of the stuff that they have that they have tried to overcome and
Here's the end. I'm gonna have to cut you off Suzanne
We got it. We got to have to wrap this meeting up in a minute
I appreciate the dialogue maybe something you all could take off fine
Do you want a very brief question for Senator? I can answer that milled-rate question before we leave this subject
Muscogee County in
2019 the milled-rate
was 40.501 in 2023. It was 38.561. So the five-year trend is downward.
That 23 is not correct. It was 38. That's what I said.
It should be 39.93 for 20. Well, I guess the DOR's numbers are wrong then.
On that particular one, yes. It's 39.93.
All right, Senator Beeson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll be real quick because I know it's time sensitive,
But I got to tell you, these counties need to live within their means.
I mean, you made the comment, there's 56 million short, but
they're going to find the money somewhere because they're going to spend it.
And they need to look at cutting instead of spending.
And Senator Albers and I will attest to this.
Fulton County now is completely municipalized.
And we thought when that happened with the services being paid for by Milton and
Johns Creek and Sandy Springs that the spending in Fulton County would go down.
is not going down. It's going up. So, you know, I just, I, I'm a little bothered by the
comment that they're going to find, we've got $5.56 million somewhere. Just, you know,
you got to make some cuts. Thanks.
Suzanne, thank you so much. Chairman Hustle, you want to close this out here?
No, I appreciate the committee's time. As I said, this was a hearing only. We want to make
sure we've got everything taken care of on this bill and bring the best bill forward.
Thank you. All right. Thank you all for coming. The finance meeting is here by
Byjourn.
