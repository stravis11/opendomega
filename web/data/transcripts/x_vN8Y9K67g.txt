----------
you you you our We're going to have the morning roll call. All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber and my clerk will unlock the machines. I guess because I don't know yet. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines. Well, good morning. Did you think it would never get here? Welcome to day 40 of the 2021 session. The workkeepers will please close the doors. Let me remind everyone that optional COVID testing is available today for one last time here. It's an optional test. I took it and it will be available in room 230 until 11 a.m. You can want to get tested one more time. I think all of you who have been so good in cooperating with our testing program, it has been successful. I'll be introducing the chaplain momentarily, but I'm going to ask that at the end of the pledge that you remain in your seats. We have a little special treat for you after our chaplain of the day. And so we remain seated until that is concluded. It's a real honor for me and a pleasure to be able to introduce today's chaplain. He's a friend of mine. His family have been friends of mine for so long I can't remember. But Dr. Chan Mitchell is the lead pastor at the Ridge Community Church in Blue Ridge. A native of Fannie and County has been made to his high school sweetheart who teaches school at West Fannie and Elementary. It's a science teacher. They have three children. His son, Kason, is with him today sitting watching on the monitor in the office in there. He's a West Georgia and the New Orleans Baptist Seminary as well as the South Eastern Seminary. And he also has a great outdoorsman, a kayaker, fly fisherman. That's kind of required sporting activities where we live. But he has done a tremendous job in our community and his the Ridge Community Church has grown and grown and become a real force in the Blue Ridge and Fannie and County areas. It's a real pleasure for me to introduce to you Dr. Chan Mitchell. Good morning to each of you. It's a pleasure to be here with you this morning and I would like to thank my representative and friend, Speaker Rauston, for the opportunity to be here to share a message of encouragement with you this morning. And let me begin by saying thank you for the important work that each of you do for the state of Georgia. This has been a challenging year to say the least. I told my congregation a few months ago that I've never experienced a season of ministry where every decision I made was both a great decision full of wisdom and prudence and at the same time a terrible decision lacking wisdom and prudence. And you probably know exactly what I'm talking about. These are challenging times to lead in. These are challenging times to serve. There have been many days that I just wanted to drop out of the race and quit running all together. And speaking of running the race for the past 40 days, you've been running a marathon. And today you begin the last leg of that race. Today you approach turn number four, the home stretch, the finish line is hopefully in sight. A wonderful story comes from the 1968 Olympics about a marathon runner by the name of John Stephen Aquari who represented Tanzania. John Aquari didn't win a medal that day at the Olympics. In fact, he didn't even come close. But through his defeat and through his pain, Aquari came to represent something much more profound and enduring than just a shiny piece of metal or a place in the record books. The truth is, Aquari was never likely to win the marathon. But if he had a chance, it was spoiled when he succumbed to leg cramps midway through the race. Not only that, but as the other runners jokied for position, Aquari stumbled and fell to the ground, gashing his knee and crushing his shoulder against the pavement. Seeing his injuries, most observers would have assumed that Aquari would have pulled out of the marathon and simply given up. Instead, after receiving minor medical attention, he returned to the course and he continued the race. His pace, of course, was now much slower than before. But his resolve was only growing stronger and so he continued to move forward, one step at a time. And eventually, long after the first place winner had crossed the finish line, long after the gold, silver and bronze medals had been presented, and long after most of the fans had left the stadium, Aquari finally finished and crossed the finish line in last place. He was cheered on by a handful of spectators who had remained and to the bitter end. And when he crossed the finish line, he was limping. His blood soaked bandages were dangling from his injured knee and he was completely and utterly exhausted. But when he was asked why he carried on, his response has went down as one of the greatest quotes in sports history. Aquari said this, my country did not send me 5,000 miles to start a race. They sent me 5,000 miles to finish the race. I believe that God put each of us on this earth to finish the race he gave us to run. It's not always important how fast we run and it's not always important in what place we're in as we run. What's important is that we finish the race. As the Apostle Paul was nearing the end of his life, he wrote a letter to a young pastor named Timothy. Paul wanted to encourage Timothy to finish the race. And so he wrote these words in 2 Timothy chapter 4. I have fought the good fight. I have finished the race. I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge will award me on that day. And not only me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing. In this race called life, we all face obstacles that we must overcome. No one faced more obstacles than the Apostle Paul. He writes that he was shipwrecked three times. Beaton robbed in prison, went without food, went without shelter and faced dangers of many kinds. Yet at the end of his life, he was able to say with confidence I was faithful until the end. I kept the faith and I finished strong. Now this past year, as a state and as a nation, we have overcome more obstacles than we can count or even remember. And even though there are still some before us, we overcame many of those obstacles together in unity. I'm certain over the past 40 days, there have been many obstacles that each of you have had to overcome together just to make it this far. And perhaps today, day 40 of this legislative session, you will face some of the most difficult obstacles yet. But today, you also will face the finish line. 40 days ago, you did not gather in this room to start a race. You gathered here to finish the race. And so today, I want to encourage you, run the race that's set before you, keep your eyes on the finish line and finish strong. And I'd like to say this in closing, a one mile run consists of four laps around a regulation track. The first lap is usually no problem as the runner feels fresh and energetic. The second lap, not as fun but tolerable, then comes the lap, the runner dreads the most, the infamous third lap. The problem with the third lap is that the runner begins to tire. His body aches, his heart races, his lungs labor. He might even begin to doubt and think of quitting. But if the runner can make it through the third lap and into the fourth, things will begin to change. On the fourth lap, the runner can see the finish line. He can hear the cheers of the crowd. He knows the race is almost finished. Suddenly, he can run faster. His arms pump even harder. He finds strength. He didn't know that he had. He can cross the finish line. He can finish strong. As you run the final lap set before you today, I pray that you will keep your eyes on the finish line and that you together will finish strong, that your endurance, your leadership and your love for this great state will sustain you until the very end. But I also pray that as we continue to run the race of life, that each of us will keep our eyes focused on the prize of Jesus Christ. The author and the finisher of our faith. So that one day we can all say together as the Apostle Paul did, I have fought the good fight. I have finished the race. I have kept the faith. Can we please pray together this morning? Dearly Father, I thank you for these who are gathered in this room today. Father, I thank you for the important work that they do every single day for the great people of the state of Georgia. Father, I know that they did not gather here 40 days just to start a race, but Father, they came here to finish something. And I pray today that you will bless them, Father with added endurance, strength, patience to overcome any obstacle that might be before them today, and Father, finish strong the race that you have set before them today. Father, I also pray that each of us in our daily lives that we fight the good fight. And Father, we keep the faith every day, the best of our ability, and the Father, one day that will finish this race strong. And we look forward to that day when we're here from you well done, good and faithful servant. And Father, may it bring honor and glory to your name. And we pray these things in Jesus Christ name. Amen. Please join me at this time for the pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag of United States of America and to the Republic, which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. And I just have to ask that you get so little room up here and I'm done. It is a honor for me now to present. We always try to do a little something special on day one and day 40. And in keeping with that tradition, we have with us today to sing the national anthem is Courtney Workhizer from Glenville, Georgia. And yes, she is the daughter of Chairman Bill Workhizer. But after today, he will be known as Courtney's father and not Chairman Workhizer. Courtney Workhizer. Oh, say can you see Father dawn to the light what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming? Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight? O the end parts we watched were so gallantly streaming. And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave or the land of the free and the home of the brave? Thank you. you you you you you you you you you you you you And until we meet again, may God hold you in the hall of this hand. You save the best for last, Mr. Chairman.

Chair recognizes representative Cameron for a morning order. Chair recognizes chairman Matthew Act for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I get to honor a woman from Griffin, Georgia. Griffin's finest from UGA Griffin. Naomi Chapman Woodruff was the first woman scientist at the Griffin Experiment Station. She was first a state employed plant pathologist at the coastal plain experiment station. Woodruff was also the first woman named to the Georgia Agricultural Hall of Fame and one of the 25 for the 21st century honored in a resolution passed by the Georgia House of Representatives in 1997. Her research was a key component. Believe this for transforming peanuts, a crop from hog feed to an essential food for us. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and go dogs. Chair recognizes representative Cameron for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today to honor the late Alan Bradford, Commissioner from Dave County, Georgia, who passed away last week after a nine-week battle with COVID-19. Alan was a Vietnam veteran. He served bravely, winning two bronze stars and a purple heart amongst other awards. He also served post-106 of the American Legion in Trenton, Georgia, helping veterans in the Dave County area and other areas. He served since 2000 as a Dave County Commissioner, helping people with all various problems they had and was a friend and neighbor to everyone. He's really going to be missed. But most importantly, he was a loved his family, his wife Kathy and his three dollars. He's going to be missed very badly by all of our people in Dave County and Walker County. So, Alan, the rest in peace, we love you and we'll miss you forever. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Chair recognizes representative Gilligan for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and colleagues. Happy sunny day. This has been quite a momentous year. I started out the year voting against our nominee for Speaker and this morning I would like to thank David Ralston for his leadership during this tumultuous session. Here are just a few of the things that we have either already accomplished or hoped to accomplish before we adjourn today. Human integrity, legislation that expands the hours that the polls are open and provides more transparency in the overall process. If we get it through, patients will not be denied access to a family member or a legal representative when they are in the hospital or nursing home situation. Child students will be able to participate in extracurricular activities. We named this in memory of Dexter Mosley and in honor of his six children. Adoption will be even easier to do here in the state which will help more of our foster children get into permanent loving homes. If we can do it today, Grace's law will make it illegal to discriminate against an organ transplant recipient due to a physical or mental disability. Simon's law will require a doctor to get the parental consent before they can put a do not resuscitate order on a minor child. These are just a few of the wonderful highlights of this year. The beauty of serving in this body is knowing that one day and on one issue, we can have full-throated debate and Jets still work together on those issues that unite us. So please join me right now in thanking Speaker David Rauston for maintaining order when the temperatures rise and for helping us do great things for the state of Georgia and her citizens. Let's go do great things and happy sunny day. And go dogs. There recognizes the majority leader of the house for a warning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And good morning to my colleagues. I'm going to do something now that I don't do enough of and that's a thank you to a number of people. The day on our final day of session, I rise to express our house's appreciation for the work done over the past few months by Georgia Tech. The test that we have taken this session was developed in house by researchers from Georgia Tech and the Georgia Tech Research Institute. During session, Georgia Tech performed over 11,000 individual tests for us. This is in addition to the over 230,000 test Georgia Tech has performed on its campuses that rolled out its testing program in August of 2020. During session, Georgia Tech identified 75 positive COVID cases enabling the time and detection of the virus to prevent community spread and keep our members and staff and the public safe. Thank you to Georgia Tech and Mike Shannon, Alex Ortiz, Julianne Williamson, Calder Childs, Morgan McCombs. Also thank you to Northeast Georgia Health System and especially to Deb Bailey for its assistance in helping us execute this testing program. North Georgia Health System physicians were responsible for certifying results and reporting them to this General Assembly. One of our own who does many things for us, but thank you especially to Keith Wee, Williams and the Speaker's Office who handled the day-to-day implementation of the testing program and made the phone calls necessary to those who tested positive. I'm sure it wasn't a fun job, Keith, but his work kept us all safe this session. Finally, thank you our members, my colleagues, without our members' commitment to this program and each other's safety, this would not have been possible. Thank you for doing what was necessary to keep us all safe while still faithfully representing our communities and conducting the people's business. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, my colleagues. You're the well. I want to thank you, Mr. Leader, for giving a shout out to Keith Williams. And I want you all to recognize him. He has, with all he's had to do to keep me straight. He has ran this testing program to perfection. And he has a doctor's smock that we tried to get him to wear in here today and he wouldn't wear it. But give Keith a big hand. The testing's are. Chair recognizes Chairman Todd Jones for a morning order. Members, atrocity, un-American, these are the words we heard from our president about the elections bill. I thought it was some type of joke. Did he not read it? Did his staff not take the time? Did his staff not take the time to brief him? This is the president of the United States and he's talking about I'm going to look to the federal government to basically take a law and try to do something the Constitution clearly says, which is the states run the election. Well, if I have an opportunity to sit down with the president, it's going to be this, sir, take that surgical scalpel and look at your home state. Your home state has a lot to improve on, on access, on ease. Early voting doesn't exist in Delaware. You know the number of early voting days you get in Delaware? Zero. The big zero. What about absentee? Do you have to provide an excuse? Yes, you do. But the one that really shocked me was this. Can you imagine you're about to vote, you're sitting at the precinct, you've given your identification and suddenly they announce your name out loud. You turn and say, why did you just announce my name? It's the law in Delaware to announce the voters' name so that you can be challenged by any individual in that precinct. And during primaries, they do the favor of not just announcing your name but announcing your party. So my ass to the White House, my ass to the president is this. We're not perfect, but his home state is far from it. And the second thing I'd like to talk to you about, I was going to talk about Jamie Diamond, chairman of Chase, born and raised in New York, and a proud New Yorker who says, our boat, our bill is restrictive, it's suppressive, it's oppressive. But yet, tell me this, Mr. Diamond. And now I'm going to add in Mr. Ed Baston from Delta. The same Delta that's invested over a billion dollars in La Guardia, a billion dollars at JFK, but yet he puts his scalpel at us. What about the jets going into New York? The jets going into New York are going into a state where you need an excuse for absentee ballot. You don't get automatic registration through your DMV and moving into the state of New York. And better yet, it took them until 2019 to have early voting. They got about halfway to us. They're at nine. Nine days, a state with almost double. So my question is this, instead of narrative, instead of false narrative, instead of rhetoric, let's talk about what we can do together on ease, on access, on transparency. That's what we should be about. The new Jersey governor, shame on him. Saying a tweet with such derogatory comments to our state, they finally get early voting across the line. And you're going to celebrate getting into the 50 yard line when we made it to the end zone. I don't think so, not here in the southeast. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. The rule about cheering and applause and conducting a pepperially atmosphere applies regardless of party in this chamber. Chair recognizes Chairman Stevens and Chairman Morris for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chairman Morris has detained this morning, but I would like to honor somebody today, after seven years, the Secretary for the first congressional district, all of us in the coastal delegation, those of us in Chattam, Brian, and Liberty counties there, as Chairman Mars. And she is here today, and I want to give it just a moment, if I will, to my sweet maid, the chairman of banks and banking for this honor. I've been honored in so many ways during my years in the legislature, excellent administrative assistants, but none better than Donna Harley. So many times people will call me and thank me for something from home. And I'll say, you're mighty welcome, call me anytime, and find out I'd have to call Donna and say, what did I do for this constituent? She would have already done it. She's as good as they come. Congratulations, only a retirement. She and I are retiring together. So it's a special day. Thank you for all your work, Donna. All right. Here's what we're going to do, the time for morning orders has expired, but we are going to have another morning order, period later in the day. And I will give you plenty of notice. Those of you who didn't reach were going to try to get everybody in today. And it's signed up now. So if you signed up, you're not going to be reached right now, but we will come back to you. Chair is going to ask every House member to please be seated. Please take your seats. Today is a day that is a very happy occasion for me. For the first time this session, we are joined by our colleague and our friend and my neighbor, who is going to recognize at this time the spouse of Representative Mickey Stevens, Mrs. Gloria Stevens, who will bring us a few words, Ms. Stevens. I am so emotional. I thank you. We have come personally here to thank you. I'm Gloria Stevens, wife of Mickey Stevens, for over 50 years consecutively. We are eternally grateful for this opportunity this morning to personally thank you for your incredible support, the efficacious prayers, and the tons of care and love. We have inspirationally felt each and every day of Mickey's illness. We just had to say, in person, thank you. I have discovered that when I introduced myself, I initially make it clear that I am not the politician. I am married to the politician. I found this need early to make the distinction quite clear. Things were being drawn at me so fast, all of a sudden. Ethics, reports. Mickey is there with past codes in his head, ventilation. They are calling, you need to pay his American Express. I haven't seen a bill for American Express. No, because it's in his computer. Things were just happening so fast. Over two years ago, Mickey left early one Monday morning as he normally does to come here to his love. Understand that that Monday, when he arrived, he couldn't wake up his leg. It just felt sleepy. The next day, I understand that you, his colleagues, wheeled him around to meetings. Later that night, early that Wednesday morning, he called me, glory, I'm in the hospital here. A hospital for what? I don't know about my leg. Well, doctors came in to treat blood plots. The doctors here were confident that they had restored blood flow, not knowing that things were a lot more serious. We got him back home the same day we got him back in Savannah. I noticed the wife of over 50 years that things were different. I call paramedics. We got him to the hospital. His team of vestular doctors came in blood plots in that same way. I remember the words of the doctor so vividly, so clearly, Mrs. Stevens. We don't know how much damage has been done to the muscles. We don't know if we can save that leg. We don't know his organs might begin to shut down. Sex is setting in. We have to do an exploratory. He went through four surgeries. One of the surgeries, he aspirated. Fluid got in his lungs. His heart rate went up. They did all they could to bring it down. And he ended up on ventilation. He was hospitalized for three months. During that time, I'm getting knocks and calls from everywhere. As I said, I knocked the politician. Who is this person? Who is that person? This person is saying that Mickey has promised this. This person is saying that Mickey is recommending. This person is saying that. The tense of care to allow them every so often, lines of people want to get into him. It was then that I made the decision to shut it down. My ultimate concern has been for his health and wellbeing and his protection. So I thank you. If it had not been for, I hope you all have a secretary like Olivia Zins. I hope you all get the care and concern from the speaker's office as we have. I hope that ethics, fiscal and all of those other departments are just as helpful to you all as they have been to us. So I thank you. This has been a life changing experience. Mickey, what I want you to say to him, ask him where is the prosthetic limb number two. And do not make sure that past codes are written down somewhere. I thank you all and thank you so much again, again and again. Thank you. The class will be at ease for a couple of three minutes.

you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you. You have no questions. Thank you. I'll be able to represent that situation. Chair recognizes Chairman Abstration to speak to the bill. Thank you, Miss Speaker. I'm here to speak to Section 2 of the bills with respect to the Rules Committee Substitute. So, tax commissioners have important responsibilities in each of our counties as we all know and they're compensated for their work typically by the salary set by the County Commission appropriated locally. An issue was brought to my attention by a member of the Gwinnett County Commission concerning the Gwinnett County Tax Commissioner and the impact potentially for increased taxes by municipal residents of Gwinnett County, the county that I'll partially represent. It's based upon this that I'm working on a bipartisan manner with other legislators including Senator Nikki Marrett and Senate on addressing that and that's reflected in the Rules Committee Substitute Senate Bill 201. It's my understanding that the Gwinnett Commission which is comprised of five Democrats supports this measure by a five to one that says strong majority of the commission supports it. I'd ask for the House's favorable consideration to Senate Bill 201 is amended by the House. Thank you. Amended by the Rules Committee. Do you owe for any questions? Yes, sir. Chair I recognize his representative McLean in the gallery to your right for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Gilliman, you. Yes, sir. Is this legislation only for Gwinnett County and not all one hundred fifth and nine counties? No, sir. The county threshold that or the city threshold that's provided would apply it to Gwinnett and Fulton County. The reason for this is that because it's so late in session, we don't know how many tax commissioners across the state are utilizing this measure. But I'm supportive of making it statewide consistent with Chairman Wendell Willard's work on this issue over the years. It's just this matter only came up very late in session as the gentleman's aware and we just don't have a full analysis as to what the impact would be if we did at statewide. There's a gentleman's deal further you Yes, sir. So instead of us having a study committee and getting with the rest of the tax commission, we want to make something locally for Gwinnett County and Fulton County and no other counting no other hundred fifth and nine counties in the state of Georgia. So that's what we're saying at this late hour. Well, no, the issue is that the tax commissioner would have the ability to sign contracts with the city over the next month. And that if this isn't addressed until next year, those contracts will already be signed and the cities, including the cities that you represent. I don't know if they're be representing any of the eight Gwinnett cities that would be impacted, but they would then be bound to that contract after the fact. And that's why there's an urgency to address this this year. I could speak or I know it's going to be a long day. So I'll yield the well and ask the House for the favorable consideration of Senate Bill 201. Gentlemen, as yielded the well chair recognizes representative Jasmine Clark to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I rise today to ask you to vote no on SB 201. First, however, I do want to thank the sponsor of the bill and my friend, Mr. Restration, for introducing this legislation as I actually do agree with the reforms put in place in this bill. The practice of being a able to supplement one salary through charging fees to municipalities needs to end. It is often very difficult to track who is doing this as he just stated and how much is being earned. However, the ability to do this is unique to Georgia among states in the southeast. Most other states do not allow this practice. Now, I know that there is bipartisan support for ending this practice statewide. Currently, there are at least 49 county tax commissioners or one third of the counties in this state that are able to supplement their salary using this practice of the 49 commissioners, 13 are democratic and 36 are Republican, showing that this is a bipartisan issue that needs to be fixed across the board. It is for that reason that I have concerns about SB 201. Section two, subsection 3a lines 114 through 116 was crackly written so as to only apply to two counties, two counties out of 49 counties that do this practice, two counties out of 159 counties in the state of Georgia. Fundamentally, it is a incumbent upon us as legislators to pass laws that fix policy and not use our power to target specific individuals because they are the new story of the week. If we can all agree that this practice must end, then I would hope we all agree that it should end statewide from the mountains of Coutusa county to the to the farms of TIF county and all across this state. Let's fix this for the entire state and get Georgia on board with the rest of the states by ending this practice for all instead of using legislation and using our power as legislators to target only a few counties out of the many counties that do this. And so again, I ask you to vote no on SB 201 so we can get this right. Thank you, I yield the well. Lady is yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair hears none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to withdrawing the committee substitute? The chair hears none. The committee substitute is withdrawn. Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee own rules? The chair hears none. The rules committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair hears none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote I those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does representative McLean rise? Pardon inquiring. State your inquiry. Is it not true that there's 157 other counties of of state elected officials that are voting on this bill that's only affecting two counties? If that's if the gentleman so states, I'm sure he believes that to be true. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of Senate Bill 201. The eyes are 112. The nays are 55. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 237. Senate Bill 237 by Senator Harveston. The 15th and Dugan of the 30th to be titled an act to amend Code section 42 86. The official code of Georgia annotated relating the special license plates promoting or supporting certain worthy agency's funds are nonprofit corporations. Let's build them for the committee on motor vehicle. Second committee recommends this bill do pass. Chair recognizes chairman Hitchens to present the bill. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I rise today on behalf of Senate Bill 237. And this truly is the simplest of simple bills. This bill was passed last year and is already in place. But we aired in identifying the nonprofit that the money was supposed to go to. So this bill includes that. It goes to the National Ranger Memorial Fund. And in the license plate is a US Army Ranger plate that requires that you either served in the Army Rangers or you graduated from Army Ranger School. There's no questions. I ask for your favorable consideration. Do you yield for a question? Certainly, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes Representative Cannon to your left for a question. Thank you. Do you yield? How much does this license plate cost as I asked the other day when we didn't get an answer for that? Do you know how much this one costs? No, I don't. The other one didn't cost anything. This one just like the plates for the University of Jordan, all the other colleges and universities and all the other nonprofits has a specified amount of money. And I don't know what it is. But all the extra money beyond what it costs the state to administer this program goes into a nonprofit fund, which in this case is a US Army Ranger Memorial Fund. There's a standard to you. Do you further yield? How you? Chair recognizes Representative Brad Thomas in the gallery to your left for a question. I want to thank you for bringing this bill. One of my best friends is an Army Ranger. And I can tell you that it doesn't matter how much that plate costs. They were willing to give our lives for us and the rights of the freedoms that we have. Thank you very much and you have my support and vote. Well, Senator Gouge carried this bill last year and he's from Dallanica where the Army Ranger Mountain Earing School was located and I live at Taisen, Tisavano, where the first Battalion, 75th Ranger regiment for the East Coast is located that it are the first people when there's trouble that they're loaded on airplanes and sent to the trouble spot. Many of them reside in my district. Do you further yield? I certainly didn't think we were going to get a lot of questions on this one but I yield. I wonder if you say the more you get recognizes Representative Earhart, do you write for a question? Thank you, Chairman Hitchens. Is it not true that my father and brother both were Army Rangers and served our country faithfully for many years? I'm sure if that's what the lady says she's very knowledgeable. Further in Clark? Is it also not true that any measure in supportive our US Army Rangers is a good thing in support of them and their families? Well, they're a special group and you know I know a lot of them and they I used to take my children down to Hunter Army Airfield when they come back from exercise or mission they all they fly along the runway and they all jump and they grew up watching that and I used to be the exo Coast Guard Reserve unit air station Savannah and my office was right adjacent to the Army Rangers and I made a lot of had a lot of friends there. Do you first yield the well? Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here's done the report of the committee has agreed to shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. have all members voted have all members voted. If so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of Senate bill 237. The eyes are 170 the nasors zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk agreed the caption to Senate bill 204. Senate bill 204 by senator Tipens to the 37th Sims of the 12th mill of the 49th but with the 55th doon and 30th and others be tied back to men chapter 4, title 20. The official go to Georgia and Teta relating to vocational technical and adult education. It's just a reminder of the state board of technical college system of Georgia to avoid to award high school diplomas. This bill having further committee on higher education and committee recommends that this bill do pass by rules committee substitute. Chair recognizes chairman Martin to present the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker ladies and gentlemen the first thing I want to make note of this does come to us today by rules committee substitute but to my members of the House Higher Education Committee the only changes that you find in the substitute and the bill you passed out of committee is subsections were numbered incorrectly on line 162 to to 12 and to 15 so there is no material change in the bill has the exact same line numbers. In fact all but those four lines have the exact same code you can match it line for line. What this bill does is sponsored by Senator Senator Lindsey Tipton's the chairman of the high senate higher ed committee does is it seeks to create a pilot program that will run for five years be done in the technical college system to allow individuals in the adult area and and minors that leave high school to get their high school degree it would allow tcsg to award a high school degree not just a g ed you know as these individuals complete their work for certification and their other technical education so that's what this bill simply does I can go through it section by section but it is as we pass it unanimously out of house higher ed this gives our young people and some young adults an opportunity to get that degree which is important to them as they go through life sometimes more important than just a g ed so mr. Speaker I'll I'll answer questions about specifics of the bill but due to the the time in the day I will belay going you've got a couple of questions if you care to yield I will take them rather than going through the entire bill yes sir chair recognizes representative al Williams to your left for a qu-

Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Yes, sir. There are many, many good parts to this bill. But my problem is, and would you explain the possibility at 16 people dropping out of a traditional high school to enter into this program? Will it be a drain? Well, we hope not. And I thank the gentleman for the question. And that is covered in the eligibility requirements in subsection E of the bill on, starts on page seven and goes to page eight. There is an extensive requirement in this pilot program for them to have the counseling. But I take the representatives' question and try to answer it like this. This is not to ease troubled folks out of high school and to make them, if you will, someone else's problem. That is not the center's intent in talking with the TCSG. That is not what we are looking to do here. That is not what the program is meant to do. In fact, it is meant to counsel them and keep them in school. If that is where they want to be and need to be. But if there is a reason, if the student is not going to stay, this gives them a bridge to a better future. But I thank the gentleman for the question. Do you further you? Yes, sir. Chair recognizes representative Gamble in room 341 for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes. I want to thank my chairman. I apologize for not getting the chance to talk to you earlier. I know it's a crazy day and we've got a lot going on. But several years ago, we passed Senate bill two that allows our high school students to complete a TCCs from our technical college in lieu of receiving the credits from their high school to graduate. And then they can have the TCC from the technical college and they can achieve the high school diploma. So I'm a little bit confused on this bill as of to what exactly we're trying to fix with this bill. I thank the gentleman for the question. I think there is a situation in this representative whereby students just aren't comfortable in the high school campus anymore. They're not comfortable towards staying in the high school environment and doing the dual enrollment. They want out of the high school. We're just finding that to happen. And if and when that happens, again, in subsection A, they go through a counseling. Our goal is to keep them in school and then the traditional high school. But the ones that decide to take a different path, if you will, this flips Senate bill two upside down and takes the advantage to provide yet another opportunity for a young person who doesn't find high school is the place that they want to go. They don't see it being their place to get that high school education while they're getting the technical education. So I think it's really about where the education is taking place and under what environment and control. That's why there's the counseling piece and that's why this is a pilot. This is the gentleman further you. Yes. One other question. I understand that I know it says it's a pilot program, but it'll fully implement statewide after five years. So it really is in a pilot program. So my question would be why, if it is an important thing that we should consider, would we not just implement it statewide now? Why do we need five years to wait on this? Well, again, I think the gentleman for the question, that the pilot program actually sends that in 2026. July 1st, I believe. And that is the pilot program. TCSG, if the pilot program is successful, if the waivers they get from the state and the federal government in order to actually confer a degree are successful, they will have that ability, but we would have to come back after this sunset and provide for language for students to transition. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, if there are no further questions, I'll yield the well-matched for the House's favorite consideration. This bill gives young people and young adults in our state the opportunity to pursue certification and pursue technical degrees. And at the same time, get a high school degree, not just a GED, and it will make them have the ability to be more successful in their life. With that, I ask the House's favorite consideration and yield the well. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to withdrawing the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is withdrawn. Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules? The chair here is none. The rules committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote aye. Those opposed to vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does representative camp rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Statute to inquiry. Is it not true that by allowing students to get their diplomas while getting technical education, this would allow more students to be more gainfully employed thus making more money over their lifetimes? I think the lady is very correct in that statement. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of Senate Bill 204. The eyes are 155. The nays are 14. This bill, having received the requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 222. Senate Bill 222 by Senator Summers, the 13th Walker, the 20 assumes the 12th Harper, the 7th Goodman, and the 8th and others. Meantotl and Actuiment, art 3, chapter 3, total 50, the official code of Georgia, annotated relating state symbols. So it's a designate the P-Can Pocom as the official statement. The principal I've referred to the committee on state planning community affairs committee recommends this bill. Do pass. I'm going to defend the clerk because where we live, they are a pecans, OK? You have to get a little further south before they become pecans. I'll ask you a question or two. Chair recognizes representative Noel Williams to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I bring this bill before this August member. I'm about the Pocom being the state nut of Georgia. This came from the Senate and in my area, this will definitely have a ripple effect for our markets and our communities. I'm also for the rest of South Georgia Pocons are very profitable and very good for our area. They're also very good to eat. So we definitely would like to see this passed in the law. And I would yield for any questions, Mr. Speaker. I have a question, but I don't know that I'm going to ask it. I know that the pecans in the industry is very important, but do they have nothing better to do across the hall than to name the state nut? Just asking. Well, Mr. Speaker, I believe it's Georgia grown in the marketing that helps our area and our community. You know, we had a hurricane that came through the control. I remember I toured the damage of the country. And this will help our community in the impact of the markets. All right. Well, you've got about seven or eight questions. Do you yield? I'll yield for a couple, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes representative Anola Witts to your left for a question. Does the gentleman yield? I do. Is it not true that my beloved father, Bob Lippincott, grew up on a farm that has a beautiful pecan grow? If the lady says speaks, I know she knows what she's talking about. Does the gentleman further yield? I do. Is it not further true that if I were to bake a pie for any members of this esteemed body, it would be a pecan pie? Yes, ma'am. And I believe the speaker would like that as well. Thank you, sir. Thank you. All right. Let's see. The chairman of the House Ethics Committee has a question. Chair recognizes Chairman Nix. Does gentleman yield? I do. Is it any coincidence that there was a pile of pecan's in any room for us to pick up today? I know not what the man speaks. You don't? No, sir. Oh, another question? Sure. Could that be considered a bribe? No, sir. I like the pecans. I actually got a couple of bags of them. So thank you. I'll take one more speaker. Now we've got the House Ways and Means chairman wanting to weigh in. Chair recognizes Chairman Blackman to your left for a question. Does the gentleman yield? I do. You know of any similarities between the fabulous pecan tree and what is known as the linden tree? Well, yes, sir. I'm glad you would ask that. The root system is extensive with the pecans, as well as the linden tree. Also, the pecan trees do not grow as tall as the linden tree. And there's sometimes there's not as much knowledge in the pecan trees or gain knowledge as there are in the linden tree. You got to remember, you talk about a bunch of us down in South Georgia, sir. But the linden tree is definitely deals with the circulation of water as well. And we need water for our farms and our pecans as well. But thank you for the question. I'll take one more. Chair recognizes the Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Chairman Dickie, to your right for a question. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, sir. I just want some assurances that this build does not take away from Georgia being the peak state. I do not. I've got some concerns that we might be called the next state. I. Well, no, sir, but if you recall, we have pecans. We have peanuts. We have peaches. We have corn. And we have watermelons in my area. And we're the watermelon capital of the world. Like I said, this ripple effect will be tremendous for our area. Well, thank you for bringing this build. We've got some great Georgia grown products of peaches and pecans in this state. So thank you very much. Well, thank you for the question. Mr. Speaker, how will yield the well? Gentlemen, as yielded the well, I'm glad that we have that issue hopefully resolved now. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass passage of the bill will vote I? Those opposed will vote no and the clerical unlock the machines. What purpose does Chairman Barr arise? Parliamentary required. Stateary inquiry. Is it not true, Mr. Speaker, that some in this body would have preferred that the official nut of the state be the chamber across the hall? I music to my ears, Mr. Chairman. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? What purpose does representative cannon rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not true that the women of this chamber were able to discuss this measure without violating any house rules today? Well not being a party to your discussion. I can't answer that question. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of Senate Bill 222, the eyes are 170. The nasors zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Chair recognizes Chairman Ed Setsler for a motion. Mr. Speaker, I like to make a motion to agree to the Senate substitute of House Bill 290 as amended by the House. Clerk will read the caption. Senate Bill 290 by a rep. Senate Bill 35, Newton of the 123rd hatches 150 to be tallied back to the man article 1 of chapter 7, Title 31. The official go to Georgia and take a regulation of hospitals and related institutions. So it's a prohibitive hospitals and nursing homes from instituting any policy during a declared public health emergency that limits patients' abilities to be visited. Chair recognizes Chairman Setsler to explain the Senate substitute and the House amendment. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, House, as we recall from a few weeks back, HB290 is a patient representation bill. The circumstances in which patients in hospitals and residents in the long-term care facilities have next of kin, what we're sending back to the Senate is the House version with some amendments that were defined in the Senate and were brought to us by the hospital community during the Senate debate. There are six of them. I'll go through them very quickly. Then Mr. Speaker, we'd like to take questions. First one was just an administrative change, managing definitions that was brought to us by Council. That's Evan on line 35. It's just a strike to make the language, make the definitions consistent. Line 53, we clarified that the rules for access, for representatives would be in printed form and be made available in the facilities. Line 65, we changed the language in person, physical contact, in person contact, clarifying simplifying, and again, still ensuring that the representatives have access and that patients have access to a representative, but eliminates any confusion about what that would mean. Line 80 and 81, we added at the request of some of the hospitals in particular, Grady, ask us about burn units, the places in which there's an exception to this kind of in-person contact. We added burn units and we added emergency psychiatric patients, as circumstances which would be treated separately and could be at the direction of a physician prohibit this in-person contact. Because, again, burn units, you're in a very, very secure immunocompromised condition. Hospitals brought to that to us on our side. We believe the language had included it, but we were just very clear. There can be no confusion now that burn units are not included and people with violent emergency psychiatric conditions. Again, brought to us by the hospitals and we've been listening throughout the process. Down below Mr. Chairman or Mr. Speaker on 83 and 84, we took the 48-hour delay of this access to any length of medical necessity. So if a physician upon medical necessity determines that a person can't have access, because there's a medical necessity, we took the limitation of that duration off. As long as the medical necessity exists, that prohibition for in-person access could continue, again, as long as medical necessity could be demonstrated by the attending physician. Again, brought to us by the hospitals and the care facilities. We're trying to manage this balance very carefully. We feel like, I think that's the right balance as we move this forward in the Senate. Lastly, Mr. Speaker, on line 103, there were some concerns about the torch structure. What this bill does, it clarifies simply. This HP290 cannot lead to any financial lawsuits against hospitals, long-turt care facilities of any kind. We made this change only in junk to relief. So the only legal action that's available for this bill is to go to court as a patient to ensure that you have access to your representative. There's no ability to sue a hospital, long-term care facility at all. That was added by the Senate and welcomed by all parties and that's in this bill. So do you ever had any concerns about civil liability? Those are all gone completely from the bill. What you have here is simply that someone can bring a case for in-juctive relief to make sure they have access as the law provides. With that, Mr. Speaker, we'd be glad to take questions. The yield for questions? Yes, sir. Chair recognizes representative Bonner to your left for a question. Is gentleman yield? I do. Is it not true that this bill in no way endangers federal funding? Yes, sir. We had spoken about that during the House debate. We went exhaustively through 100 pages of federal regulations and confirmed that this in no way congeparized federal funding. We've done that by carefully crafting the definitions by making a federal reference here in the code and by putting a belt and suspender language to ensure there's no way possible for this to affect our state's CMS federal funding and that's been recognized throughout the process. So thank you for the question. In about a while. That's also been confirmed by the Department of Community Health. Do you further you? One more question, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes representative Stacey Evans to your left in the gallery. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. This state and this body in particular has done a lot to clamp down on sex trafficking and to stand up for victims and make sure that they're getting the protections that they need. And I know that a lot of hospitals have special procedures in place for victims of sex trafficking and assault to make sure that they're the folks that are making them subject to being trafficked don't get in to see them. I know they raised that concern and asked for a carve out and they didn't get it. Can you tell me why we wouldn't want to stand up and make sure that these victims are protected? It's a question that we work through and I think we demonstrated very clearly in committee that the definition of consent as we recognize anybody, and I'll answer that question there's sort of two parts to that. The first part is anyone who asks is the patient to have someone not have access to the hospital they have that power. That's in no way changed by this bill. We recognize the rights here don't aren't for the visitor or for the legal representative or the central caregiving, so the right of all of this is the right of the patient. So the patient has the ability to have anyone not show up that they want to. Secondly, under existing law and under this bill, if hospital staff recognize and believe that there's not valid consent being given, there's coercion, that applies under existing law. When someone is coercion someone, enforcement is going to get consent, and valid consent doesn't exist. So as it exists today under our current law, that same circumstance could exist. This bill in no way changes that. And if hospital staff believe that the person's being forced and they're not really giving consent, then they're able to prevent access. Because again, the right is that of the patient. This bill in no way changes that circumstance. We've got the, we have provisions under existing law to accommodate that. Do you further you'll? I do. A lot of victims of sex trafficking are young and they're scared and they're vulnerable and the hospital is being able to step in for them and make a no visitor policy is power for them. Now, we are in a situation is not true that we are going to make the victim make the call to limit visitors when they may not be in a state of mind to do that. If the hospital presumes that there is coercion, which is very hard to prove, we're going to put the hospital in a situation of having to choose between protecting a victim and potentially being subject to a lawsuit and then further putting that victim in harm's way because now they're going to be not only subject to a visit from their perpetrator, but they're going to be a subject of a lawsuit. Is that not true? That's not true, Mr. Speaker. I'm not going to, I respect the lady I've worked with a number of years. It sounds like again with the deepest respect to my friend from, from Cobb and now Morning side. I don't want to get into a, I think the lady's mischaracterizing the substance of this. I think there's a real interest in the hallway to take something and characterize it with a level of what ifs and hypotheticals that in no way are impacted by this bill, this bill in no way impacts the ability for a patient to consent to have a visitor visit them, whether you're in a circumstance today under existing law, someone wants to come in, the patient is uncertain whether they want to consent to it or not, the hospital folks are uncertain of that. This bill doesn't change that. I think you're trying to, again, I don't want to say that it's a non-substantive answer or non-substantive question, but this bill does not change that. What this bill does do is it gives patients the opportunity to be seen by a legal representative who advocates for them. Right now what we've seen across our state is tens of thousands of people, tens of thousands of people who have been left alone to languish in hospitals, languish in long-current care facilities without any access to a representative, to represent them. Federal Regulations, Mr. Speaker, and I'm wrapping up here, Federal Regulation clearly recognizes the state's province to find the role of the legal representative, and in doing that gives people the opportunity if they're laying in a hospital bed to have someone who knows them, to see them, help assess their circumstances and advocate on their behalf when laying in a hospital bed and compromise positionally oftentimes, are unable to advocate for themselves. So appreciate the questions on this. I think we found in debate that many of the hypotheticals were kind of thrown out as hand grenades, weren't valid, and with that, Mr. Speaker, I'll take one more question. One more? One more to speak. Mr. Speaker recognizes Chairman Newton to your right for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, with the gentleman yield. I do. Isn't it true that just earlier today we saw a beloved fellow representative who was here with some family members who I think I heard correctly spent three months in the hospital, but standing right next to him was his legal representative who I think was a tiger on his behalf, and wouldn't that have been horrible if he had been denied that legal representative, that one person to fight for him, and might even his life have been much different? I think we had in living flesh to our own body. Whatever our own members, in fact, our own members legal next to him is representative of his wife, 50 years, that said her ability to stand there and help advocate for him had a big impact on. Again, this was not part of the debate until it was lived out before this morning, so appreciate the question. And I would say, Mr. Speaker, to leave in the minds of others not only is it affected our own members profoundly in these last couple years, but children's health care in Atlanta, serving our young people here in the metro area have in essence been living the HP290 conditions of the last year. Throughout this entire pandemic, legal representatives have able to stand by the patients and children's because they're young, they're kids, they're 14, they're four, they're five, they're 10. Procedures are in place to have legal representatives to be able to advocate for people in the hospitals here in Atlanta that it's happened throughout this pandemic. If you're 14, you can have a legal representative. Why can't you have one if you're 24 or 64 or 84? House Bill 290 gives you the ability to do that, and with that, Mr. Speaker, I would urge your favorable consideration of the motion. Okay, there is an amendment, a House amendment. It is amendment AM331976. Is there any objection to the adoption of the House amendment? There is an objection. Does the gentleman move? Gentlemen moves. The question before this House is only adoption of the Setsler Amendment AM331976. All those in favor of the amendment, of adopting the amendment will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does Representative Evans rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Isn't it true that the Speaker in the well spent a lot of time talking about how we carved out specific exceptions to make sure that we were protecting patients in the burn unit? And isn't it true that I'm offended that we could not extend the same courtesy and protection to victim of sex trafficking? If the lady so states, what purpose does Chairman Setsler rise? It's a poor amendmentary inquiry. Isn't it true that in no way do we sidestep that issue? We took that issue on head on. We consider it carefully both in the committee and the House and in the Senate to recognize that the provisions of this bill accommodated that adequately and is a mischaracterization of this bill. It's an attack on something based on a false premise. If the gentleman so states, what purpose does Chairman Oliver rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Isn't it true, sir, that I am always extra careful when the Senate claims to be entering into the tort reform area? And in this bill is described by the Chairman, a person could enter the hospital for the purpose of visiting a loved one, violate every security protocols, do direct injury to the loved one, which happens in hospitals and care facilities out of very strange dynamics. And the hospital would have no liability of any kind for injury done to that hospital under this proposal of the court reform. If the lady so states, I'm sure she believes that to be true. All right, does all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the adoption of the amendment, AM 33, 1976. The eyes are 97. The nasal 73 and the amendment has been adopted. On the gentleman's motion that the House agree to the substitute to House Bill 290 as amended by this House. All those in favor will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. What purpose does the representative weigh, drives? Stature inquiry. Is it not true that my family experienced the gut-riching situation with a father who had 12 separate falls over the last nine months and succumbed to not only the fact that dementia took his life, but it was rapidly, his decline was rapidly sped up due to the fact that we had limited access during a pandemic in which folks were trying to figure out what do no harm really meant.

If all members voted, if all members voted on the gentleman's motion, the eyes are 100 to the knees are 70. This house has agreed to the Senate substitute to House Bill 290 as amended by this house. Chair wants to announce that Pfizer vaccines will be offered to anyone, including those who are not state employees in capital rooms, 216 and 230, beginning at noon and going until 3 o'clock PM this afternoon.

Lunch will be served to the Code Revision Committee, lunch for the Code Revision Committee, and 403 capital upon adjournment. Thank you. Chair recognizes Chairman Mitchell. Chair of the minority caucus for an announcement. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Lunch will be provided for the Democratic Caucus in room 216. No meeting is scheduled at this time. Just lunch in 216.
