And now the Georgia flag. I pledge allegiance to the Georgia flag and to the principles of which it stands. Listen to justice, moderation, and courage. Today is my pleasure to introduce the preacher of the day. Chris Butler is a lifelong resident of Lumpkin County. Now, y'all listen to me. I'm going to explain the name of the church where he preaches it. Where I'm from and where the deacons are from that are up here in the gallery is pronounced Yehuah Baptist Church. But if you're from Atlanta or Chicago or maybe New York, it's Yehuahula Baptist Church. Chris attended the Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College where he holds a doctor of theology degree. He's also the president of the Northeast Georgia Bible College located in DeLoniger. Among these important roles in our community, he also holds a passion for forestry. Chris began a career as Lumpkin County's Ranger in 1997. He rose through the ranks as a chief ranger, district manager, and region manager. Over the course of 27 years, Chris has managed and mitigated damages from numerous fires and hurricanes, ensuring that our state's forestry industry is prepared for disaster. Fittingly, Chris was named the deputy director of the Georgia Forestry Commission this January. Thank you, Pastor Butler, for joining us this morning. And I would love to form you to come and share the message with our senators. Welcome. Good morning. I want to say it's an honor and a privilege. And I want to thank Majority Leader Gooch and this body of this Senate for allowing us to come this morning. And do one of the most important things that I can do. And that's shared with you the precious word of God. Out of the many hats that I wear and roles that I feel, this is the most important thing I do. And as Steve said, we try to pastor at Yehu Labab district church and it's just a privilege and an honor. I want to share with you just a quick thought this morning. And I want to bring this out of Proverbs 14 in verse 34 of the Wisdom of King Solomon. Proverbs 14 in verse 34 says, But sin is an approach to any people. Now I want to bring the thought this morning that a righteous nation and a righteous state. As I walk through the halls and I have the privilege of coming to the Capitol quite a bit and as I walk through the halls, I notice that on the wall we have the bill of rights. And I walk a little further and I see the Constitution of the United States of America. But just proceeding that and I don't know who put it in this order but I'd like to hug their neck. Just proceeding that is the 10 commandments, the actual foundation and the framework of both of those documents. And I look at that and I think about that and I take our text this morning in Proverbs 14 in verse 34 that righteousness is what exalts a nation. And those 10 commandments are the foundation. They're the framework of righteousness. And so as we think about that, I'm reminded of a quote from James Madison, the actual architect of the Constitution and the Fourth President of the United States. He said we have staked the whole future of American civilization upon the power of government, but far from it. We have staked the future upon the capacity of each of us to govern ourselves and to sustain ourselves according to the 10 commandments of God. When I look at that verse, righteousness exalts a nation. I'm reminded that righteousness, according to the Webster's 1828 dictionary, the word righteous means a keeping of a divine law. And so we think about that and we think about the magnitude of God's law and how important it is to each and every one of us as character. But James chapter 2 verse 10 says, for who should ever should keep the whole law and yet offend in one point is guilty of all. Now the Bible is very plain and very clear that we on our own efforts cannot obtain righteousness. We don't have it. It's not in our capacity. And just like an Alicate can go on the corner and lick his paws, he's still an Alicate. He's still in his eyes that might be cleansing. And in our eyes we may think that we are righteous in our own selves. But I'm reminded of Philippians 1 and verse number 11, being filled with the fruit of righteousness which by Jesus Christ unto the glory and praise of God. The fact of the matter is that our righteousness and the only righteousness we have this morning is through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. The imputation of righteousness that he gave some 2000 years ago on a Roman cross and on a Roman hill, our Lord and Savior stretched his arms and shed his blood for us. That we can have righteousness. So if righteousness is what exalts and that word exalt simply means to be lifted above, if our righteousness of this nation and the righteousness of our state is going to continue, it has to be founded in the commandments of God. It has to be founded in the righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ because outside of Jesus there is no keeping of righteousness. But I come to bring you good news today. This body and those that are gathered in this chamber up there and down below. None of us have to tote the burden of having our own self-righteousness. We can have righteousness through the acceptance of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. And none of the members of this Senate has to walk in with a burden of the governance that you have to carry out upon yourself. You simply have to give that to the Lord Jesus Christ and of a prayerful heart come in these chambers, humble and submissive to His will, and the righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ will exalt this nation. It will exalt this state and it will exalt the people that you serve. I say today without Jesus Christ there is no righteousness, without Jesus Christ there is no governance, without Jesus Christ there is no power and authority over our land. Let's all stand for a moment of prayer. Dear God and our Father, Lord, as we bow before this body, God, I pray, God, that you touch each and every one of these ladies, these gentlemen, God, as they make the laws of our land. And God, I pray that the sweet, holy spirit of God would touch them. And God, I pray that the governing hand of God would be upon this body. And God, as they make decisions and they go forth, God, I pray that you would guide them and Father, give them the wisdom as we've heard in the pledge of this great state. God, the wisdom that only comes from God in heaven, God, I pray you to ordain them. Father, you tell us in Romans chapter 13 that these elected officials have been ordained by you. And God, I pray over them right now. And Father, as we stand in the hollow halls of this chamber, God, I pray, God that you would give them action. And God, you would give them understanding, Father, to follow the principles of God's Word and the principles of the commandments of God.

is they govern. Now Father, You bless and You help and we thank You so much today for the opportunity to stand and share the Word of God. Lord, You bless and You touch today in today's decisions and those that are stretched out in the future. God, You have Your will and way. These things we asked in prayer in the precious dear name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen and amen. We've got some special guests with us today, Mr. Secretary. Please read a resolution. Sent Resolution 229 by Senator Peach the 21st and others resolution recognizing commanding rude bow and for service on the Georgia Department of Transportation Board and for other purposes.

Mr. President that completes the order. Thank you Mr. Secretary. Is there objection to the adoption of the resolution and of course the chair here is none and the resolution is adopted. I honored to now call upon the distinguished senator from the 21st to introduce our special guest this morning. Thank you Mr. President. Senators before I introduce our special guest I want to introduce some of the guests that are up here on stage with us. We got John D. Stevens and his wife Beverly right here. We have the senator from the 27th our chairman of transportation. We have the senator from the 45th the vice chairman of transportation and we have the senator from the 51st who served with Rudy on the DOT board. We're here to honor Rudy Boen. He's a dear friend of mine and I'm very pleased to be able to do this. He's a great businessman. He served 19 years on the DOT board twice as chairman and he's a great family man. I've known Rudy for over 20 years and I can tell you I've learned a lot from him. And we served on the DOT board together and I got to tell you we served pre house bill 170. We didn't have very much money. We couldn't hardly afford to cut the grass in between interstates but through his leadership we did a lot with very little. And I was proud to name a section of highway 20 the Rudy Boen highway and my daughter actually lives up there so I travel that road quite a bit. But I tell you that out of all the projects that he's done I think he's most proud of the one that's we're going to cut the ribbon on probably in about six to eight months. And that's the new McGinnis ferry interchange and forlaining McGinnis ferry from 400 to John's Creek hospital which will then have four way access east west connectivity from 400. All the way over to 85 and that was his vision that created that interchange and that for four lane highway for east west connectivity.

Thank you So There's yielded the chair recognizes the senator from the 19th We're point of personal privilege Thank you mr. President members of the senate um Thursday when we were in here I had Senate bill 57 many of you remember that bill it died in dramatic fashion and The during the debate some leaders of the opposition made some statements about it You know it doesn't happen in Georgia debanking doesn't happen in Georgia Or that frivolous litigation would just be rampant if we were to pass 57 What you may not know is that after you went home Obviously, I could not have known this the Trump organization filed suit on friday in that tort friendly state of Florida With 300 counts of debanking against capital

one bank. Members, I submit to you that we were told that the banking was very rare occurrence that didn't ever happen, but if the Trump suit against capital one includes over 300 counts, it sounds like that's not as rare as we may have been told. Further, we were told that frivolous suits would abound if we passed that bill. I hope no one's accusing the Trump Organization of filing a frivolous suit. I bring that up now because I want to serve notice to you that I think this issue matters. I think it matters to conservatives. I think it matters to those who've seen their constitutional rights, otherwise limited. And I want to let you know that I'm going to continue this fight and I hope after seeing what you did on Friday that many of you will join with me. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the wealth. Chair recognizes the Senator from the 45th. Okay. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise today recognizing and commending the Georgia team Republicans, the Georgia team Republicans that were created 1960 and have been working to educate and power connect and connect the youth to conservative politics, fostering a spirit of civic engagement and leadership the young, young people here in Georgia. The Georgia team Republicans are active in a group of serving young conservatives in Georgia working to engage peers in the political process advocating for conservative values and supporting Republican candidates at all levels of government here in the state of Georgia. The mission of the Georgia team Republicans is to inspire the next generation of leaders by encouraging youth, involvement in politics, supporting the principles of individual liberty, limited government and free markets and working to elect Republicans who uphold those values. We've got some of the team Republicans, Georgia team Republicans and their leadership here with us in the gallery. If you would please stand and be recognized. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the wealth. Thank you, Senator. Chair recognizes the Senator from the 25th, or opponent of personal privilege. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to ask for a moment of silence. Yesterday, Ms. Don Janine King, 58-year-old deputy, Jones County. She was a jail officer, passed away. They found her deceased, apparently, of natural causes. I would just like to ask for a moment of silence for that family as they undergo playing their loved one to rest. But thank you, Mr. President. Please stand while the Senator is asked for a moment of silence. Thank you. Thank you, Senator. Thanks for bringing that to our attention. Does any other Senator wish to rise on a point of personal privilege? All right. We're going to move on now. You have a consent calendar of privileged resolutions before you. Does any Senator wish to remove a resolution from the consent calendar? Senator from the 55th, what purpose do you rise? Okay, Senator, come on down. We'll have your point of personal privilege now before we move on to the next portion. Chair recognizes the Senator from the 55th for appointing a personal privilege. Good morning, colleagues. I rise simply to bring to your attention. Yesterday was a very notable day in the history of our country toward a more perfect union as we developed this thing, this notion called democracy. It was 60 years ago. There were people like John Lewis that crossed the bridge over in a city where I, along with several other colleagues, yesterday, marched across the bridge called the Edmund Pettus Bridge, a place called Selma, where there was blood that was paid for the right to vote, a right that unfortunately I stand here today, saying that I was born in this country without that protection. And it is that very protection today that is threatened, even this day that my right is being protected, is not being protected, as we do not have a voting rights bill. And I would challenge this August body to entertain such a notion as entertaining a right to vote, because I seek one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice not just for the powerful, not just for the billionaires, but for all. And in some notion here, as we seek this more perfect union, as we seek a United States, we have those that are for a separate or a separation versus a diverse group of persons for diversity. As I stand today for diversity, equity and inclusion, I would remind you that we cannot utterly stand by, as we are attacked, and on February 28th, we saw target returns from this DEI, and you saw a 14% decrease in their standing for that day, 5% for Walmart, 2% for some others. But we will ask all those of good will to join us as those who do not support us, we cannot support them. If you do not like me, you do not like my dollars. We will withdraw our dollars for anyone, any corporate company, anyone who steps on our toes. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. President. All right. Does any other Senator wish to speak on a point of personal privilege? All right. If... Is it from the 36th? All right. Chair recognizes the Senate from the 36th for a point of personal privilege, and I think this will wrap us up. Thank you, Mr. President. Colleagues, I've come to the whale briefly to just flag. As we heard a few minutes ago from the Senate or from the 19th, there's late breaking news can deliver some real surprises. And I think that many of you that voted for the Senate Bill 68, commonly known as Tort Reform, might be a little bit flabbergasted to learn that victims of sex trafficking are going to have a much harder pathway to any justice if that bill passes. It's in the House now in a special committee under rules. But you may be familiar. Sadly, there are all too many of these hotels, extended stay facilities operating in many counties that in fact turn a blind eye to sex trafficking that's going on on their property in the rooms that they rent out. And with many, many victims, we personally know an attorney that's represented victims who understands the challenges of approaching these hoteliers, these people are running these places, as a nuisance property. That's now removed if this bill becomes law that many of you voted for. So this is a matter of high concern. There's been a lot of bipartisan participation over recent years to oppose, stand and oppose sex trafficking. The Senate Bill 68 makes it more difficult to get justice for the victims of sex trafficking. And for those who have a joining property or living in nearby neighborhood that want to see a shady operation that's got sex trafficking going on on their property, invisible and in and out of the rooms. And these are court cases that have been processed and been successful in the past, would no longer be able to challenge these people that are renting out their rooms and turning a blind eye to sex trafficking going on on their property. So look into it now rather than later. Don't wait to go home and then find out that we were blindsided by this. We know sex trafficking is a huge issue and we in no way should support a bill that's going to make it difficult to get justice for those who are trafficked. I yield the will. Thank you, senators yielded the will. All right, let's move on now. You have a consent calendar of privileged resolutions before you. Does any senator wish to remove a resolution from the consent calendar? Is there objection to the adoption of the resolutions on the consent calendar? The chair here is none of the resolutions on the consent calendar are adopted. Are there any motions to withdraw and commit? Recognize the senator from the 56th. Thank you, Mr. President. I'd ask unanimous consent that House Bill 147 be withdrawn from the Committee on Economic Development and be committed to the Committee on Science and Technology. Mr. Secretary, please read the caption. House Bill 137 by represent Thomas for the 21st and others, Bill's been telling that to amend Chapter 25 of Title 50, the official code of Georgia annotated, loyal to the Georgia Technology Authority. The Senate has been recommended to provide for an annual inventory of artificial intelligence usage by the state agencies to provide for annual reports of such for the authority to develop and establish certain policies to write for related matters to appeal to the law and further purposes that can be seen with Mr. President. The senator from the 56th has moved that HB 147 be withdrawn from economic development and tourism and committed to science and technology is your objection. We have an objection. All right, we've got an objection. Does the senator from the 53rd wish to speak to your objection? Problem interior inquiry, Mr. President. Have both of them agreed to this transfer? They have. The senator has a minor standing that they have. Is your objection withdrawn? Senator from the 53rd. Is your objection withdrawn? All right, the objection to, just make sure we know where we are, the objection to transferring Senate House Bill 147 to being withdrawn from economic development and tourism. The commitment to tourism and committed to science and technology is now moved without objection. All right, very good. Thank you. You have a local consent calendar of local bills before you. Mr. Secretary, are there any objections filed to any bill on the local consent calendar? Mr. President, the objections have been filed. Is there objection to the agreement to the report of the committee on state and local government operations, which is favorable to the passage of the bills on local consent calendar? The chair here is known and the report of the committee is agreed to. The question is now on the passage of the bills on the local consent calendar. All those in favor will vote yey, those opposed nay. Mr. Secretary, unlock the machine. On the passage of the bills on the local consent calendar, the yey, the 43, the nays are won and this bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. All right, we're going to move on to the rules calendar. We've got one bill. The secretary will read House bill 15 House bill 15 by representative Williamson of the 112th and others. The bill is being told to amend Title VII of the OCEGA, which is to provide procedures concerning the requirements of the court of unions, to provide licensure requirements for money transmission, cash payment, and mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers for banking institutions and installment loans to rise auditing procedures for mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers, to rise for corporate governance requirements for mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers, to rise for liquidity requirements for mortgage lenders and mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers, to rise for mortgage requirements for applications to relocate for foreign banking institutions, by its related matters to repeal public and laws and further purposes. Mr. President, I'm making and financial institute students the recommends of this bill do pass or spend it center summers chairman that police you are a Mr. President. I recognize the senator from the 18th district to speak to House bill 15. Thank you Mr. President. All right it's that time of year y'all for our annual banking rewrite that comes to us from the Department of Banking and Finance. It's their housekeeping bill. It contains proposed legislative changes identified internally by the department that suggested by the industry over the course of the previous year. This bill this year particularly contains revisions to laws impacting banks, bank holding companies, credit unions, merchant acquired, limited purpose banks. That's a particular term of art. Foreign bank offices, installment lenders, money service businesses, money transmitters, sellers of payment instruments and check casters. And it also there are a few areas that touch on mortgage lenders and broker laws. The legislation was shared with the Georgia Bankers Association as they normally do also with the Community Bankers Association, the Georgia Credit Union Affiliates, the Mortgage Bankers Association of Georgia, the Georgia Financial Services Association and the Georgia Installment Lenders Association. I give you those names because those are all the institutions that are really touched upon by these proposed changes. Equally important, no one has expressed any objection or any opposition to any of the changes that are being proposed. The bill proposes much needed cleanup of things that have been recognized by the banking departments as we gathered last year and passed the annual banking cleanup last year. And I'll tell you at past unanimously out of the House Banking and Financial Institutions Committee. I know we've been here for quite a while to get to our first bill. I've got all the sections but I'll just highlight a couple of sections for you. In particular, sections four and five. This is where the proposed legislation really tries to align the regulations that apply to banks and what apply to credit unions. Those are not the same and in many regards we're trying to bring those in alignment. There's also some sections involving how and under what circumstances folks can qualify to get licenses to serve as a mortgage broker. And there's other sections in here. Happy to answer any questions. One other section I'm going to bring your attention to sections. It's 13 and 16 through 20. Deal with some issues involving minimal financial requirements for those that want to be mortgage lenders and as well as those who want to be mortgage brokers. You'll find consistent with mostly what they do every year. You'll find alignment with some of the regulations in Georgia that are out of set with what's the regulations that are applicable from the federal regulations. So lots of times it's simply aligning those. Anyway, happy to tell you more but it's in the bill and happy to answer any questions or happy for you guys to get on and vote because this is the only bill we've got on the floor today. Mr. Senator, I think you have a hard question from the delegation member from making senator from the 26. You have a question. All right. Thank you, Mr. President. Well, yes, I sure do from my senior. What I'm what I'm wondering is by us passing this and the chairman of the corporation got up this morning talked about the suit in Florida. I feel that suit and I think it was capital one that he was talking about will that suit have any effect on what we're doing today. Senator, no, I don't think there are any provisions in here that relate to the issues that touch on Senate bill 57 that we developed that was debated on last Thursday. So we do have a bill that does the same thing in Florida. I don't know what's going on in Florida. Did you with Jim and you. Yes, sir. Did you hear the chairman of appropriations this morning talk about the suit in Florida. Yes, on capital one. Yes. And what I'm wondering is what we are doing will that suit have any effect on what we're doing here in Georgia. Senator, I really can't answer that. I don't think so, but I've not seen the suit. Apparently it just got filed a few days ago. I've not seen it read it. The only thing I've heard about it came from what the center from the 19th set in the well. So I don't know about that independent piece of litigation down in Florida. I don't know why that would. I don't know why this bill and I think what you're asking me is does this bill somehow impact that litigation in Florida. I don't see how it does. Well, I was just wondering I got a capital one a cap to all right. Very good. Thank you, Senator. I appreciate that. I encourage your support for this bill and appreciate your positive vote without I yield the well. Senator, you had one more question if you care to yield. Okay. Senator from the 53rd has a question. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, pro Tim, just have a concern. It seems to me and I heard this in the committee that we haven't had a bank fell in the state in almost two decades. Is that not true? You said we haven't had a bank failure in two decades. Yeah, roughly two years. You mean a Georgia bank failure. I think I think in the great recession if that's not true. Well, we had a number of banks as you may be aware that failed or were taken over by the FDIC. So you use the word failed. That means different things in different banking environments. So I'm not sure what you mean. But if you're stating a fact, do you understand to be factual than I'll accept that? I'm sure you intend to be correct. Well, can you help me out online 154 through I guess it's 158. It seems there that you're creating language that's going to create like a certificate of need for credit unions. Let me get that. Where's that center to one 154? It says whether the convenience and needs of the public will be served by the proposed credit union. You know, I don't think anybody would want to go into business if they weren't serving the needs of the public. So why should they ask the government for permission to do that? The center of that simply aligns the requirements for denovo or start up banks. The requirements and obligations upon a credit union that wants to start will now be aligned with the same obligations and requirements of a new bank that wants to start new as well. The reason that for the languages to make those in parity so they'll both be the same. We've not had a credit union request to start in this state in over 40 years. Don't you think this language will make it even more difficult to have those requests? No, because there needs to be oversight. If you understand what the Department of Banking of Finance does in the state and you understand the protective measures that they have for the citizens of Georgia, you understand that there needs to be some requirements. And again, the requirements for credit unions to start are now no different, no more, no honoris than the requirements to start a bank. They're the same. It simply updates the language to bring those to in parity. Okay. Thank you, Mr. President. You're welcome. Senator, you have no more questions. All right. Thank you, Mr. President. It occurs you're a positive vote and I'll yield the wealth. Does any other senator wish to speak for or against the measure? The chair here is none. Is there objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none and the previous question is ordered. Is there objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which is favorable to the passage of the bill? Here's our objection to the main question being ordered. The chair here is none and the main question is ordered. The question is on the passage of the bill. All in favor of the bill will vote ye, oppose nay, the secretary will unlock the machine. On the passage of the bill, the yeas are 46 and the nays 1. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. The chair recognizes the senator from the 52nd for a motion. Thank you, Mr. President. Pursue out to Senate rule 7-1.10b. I give notice on the next legislative day. I intend to move to the Senate, consider House Action on Senate bill 77. This is a local bill that they had put in Bartow County instead of the city cars. Well, this is the best way to fix it. Senator, thank you for the notice. All right. The chair recognizes the distinguished majority leader for motion. Mr. President, I move the Senate's standard adjourned until 10am on Tuesday, March 11. Majority leader has moved. The secretary will read announcements. Mr. President, the rules committee will meet upon adjournment on 415th the Capitol. The public safety committee will meet on 415th the Capitol. At 230, the Health and Human Services Committee will meet on 415th the Capitol. At 330, the finance committee will meet in Ms. 1 and at 430, the judiciary committee will meet on 370 and the COOBE. That completes the order, Mr. President. Are there any additional announcements? I see none. The majority leader has moved that the Senate's standard adjourned until tomorrow Tuesday, March 11, 2025 at 10am. All those in favor of the motion will say A and those opposed will say, A. Let's try that again. All those in favor say, A. All those opposed. I think the eyes still have it. We're adjourned. All right. Thank you.
