you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you Good morning members. We're going to have the morning roll call. All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines? I have all members voted. So the clerk will lock the machines. Doorkeepers will you please close the doors and keep them closed? As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain today, this morning, will be introduced by the lady from the 90th House District Representative Draper. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. It is my honor to introduce to you today Reverend and Dramada Woodworth. Reverend Woodworth is originally from Atlanta Proper and graduated from Grady High School, now Midtown High, and Oxford College, Emory College, and the Canter School of Theology, Hall of Emory University. Andy is an ordained elder in the United Methodist Church and has served churches in various roles in Erigan, Rome, and helped found neighborhood church in Atlanta in 2016 alongside her co-paster, Angie. Andy has three brilliant and creative children, Danny, who is 14, Cameron, who is 13, and Charlie 12, and they all joined us today up in the gallery. Andy loves, thank you. Andy loves all kinds of music, gardening, a good savoury scone, and helping people in communities grow, the creativity, courage, and cooperating with God. And just on a personal note, I want to say that neighborhood church is absolutely the heart and center of my community. The first time I went there was when the scouts had a pinewood derby tournament in their basement. They host girl scouts, they host neighborhood meetings, they have a food pantry, a preschool, so when I think of neighborhood church, and when I think of Reverend's and Angie, I think of the heart of our community, and I'm so glad to share their words with you today. Good morning. Good morning. Thank you so very much, Mr. Speaker and distinguished guests, and particularly to Representative Draper for this invitation today. It is a deep honor and delight to be here with you all this morning. So right after college, I was a part of something called the Georgia Cracker Crumble. It was a fundraiser event that was held for many years by the Georgia Press Association, and I got to sing and act and portray some very prominent Georgia figures in little skits. And some of y'all might remember that event. I don't believe it's held any longer, but there were many legislators and other leaders that attended this fundraising event. So I feel somewhat at home in a room just like this one with you or perhaps some of your colleagues. We might recognize each other from those days, perhaps, but probably not. I got cuter since then. As I was preparing for this moment, I remembered the little rhyme that my grandmother taught me in the little Methodist church in Newburn, Georgia, where they lived. The little rhyme went like this. You probably know it. This is the church. This is the steeple. Open the doors and see all the people. Now, I learned this when I was very young. I feel like it was deeply embedded in my heart. And I bring this up because I have come to claim that last phrase, open the doors and see all the people as a motto for my ministry and as a framework for my practice as a pastor. Be all the people. I have tried in my years of ministry to see the people in front of me as people, as human beings, whether they were legislators or governors, whether they were bishops or they were atheists, whether they were unhoused or hospitalized or in line to be canonized. I have tried to see the people in front of me as human beings worthy of being seen as fully human. So I am delighted to see and be invited by Representative Draper who is a neighbor of ours. She lives right around the corner from my family in Atlanta. But before I lived in Atlanta, we lived across the street from Representative Dempsey in Rome. And so we have been neighbors too. How are Lynn and the Grand Babies, Katie? My family is from the very corner of Morgan County where my parents now live in our family farmhouse. I've spent time with other family members in Metter and in D'Lanaga and I lived for a time in Oxford and in Polk County and all of these places across our wonderful state. I have seen so many people as different as we all were. We were all loved by God. And all of us are fully human deserving of the things that we need to thrive. I want you to know that I see you as fully human. I want you to invite you to join me in what we call in my tradition a spiritual discipline. And this discipline is to try to see all the people as we are not as we might imagine us to be. See I know that the labels that we put on other people, even the roles that we step into, can in some ways be dehumanizing. As a pastor I can be seen as superhuman or superholy. Y'all I love Jesus but I cuss a little bit sometimes. And as lawmakers I can imagine people see you in ways that look right past who you really are. The nature of our contentious political and social life means that we see the little letter after people's names or we see skin color or we see a rainbow pin or a team jersey or what kind of truck they're driving. And we begin to make assumptions about people. Assumptions that can even in tiny ways cause us to begin to see those other folks as slightly less human than we are. In my Christian tradition we remember that when Jesus was asked what the greatest commandment was, he said, and this is a paraphrase from Matthew 22. The first thing is you should love the Lord your God with all of who you are and the second is right there with it, you must love your neighbor as yourself. Y'all it's very hard to love your neighbor if you don't really see your neighbor. To see your neighbor not as an opponent or a target or even as an opportunity but to see them for their humanity made and beloved by the divine. Y'all I don't know all of your stories, I would love to hear them if we ever get a chance to share them with each other. But I do know that we all come from all over this great diverse and creative and boisterous state and I would invite all of us to see more of the people of Georgia as we are not as we imagine us to be. I'd love to go on a walk on the belt line with you sometime here in Atlanta or to ride around with you in your community if we ever get a chance to see more about how the people of Georgia are in 2024. Surveys and Poles and Town Hall meetings can only show you so much. Sometimes you need to do what's called a windshield survey. You need to get in a car and drive around or get out and walk around and see and listen and notice how things are on the ground. Churches are notoriously bad about this because we often do our work in church buildings and so I am reminded to open the doors and see all the people. I'm sure that legislators never ever get stuck in offices or meetings more than you would like. How can you open the doors and see all the people? All the people. Because while some of us are just fine, some of us are scared, angry and feel more and more hopeless, more and more disconnected from solutions to the stuck places of our lives, it is hard out here, y'all. And if you don't know that, let me take you on a tour just down the street. And y'all I know and I trust and I see that it is hard in here too. Maybe you are scared or you are angry or you feel hopeless. It doesn't hurt to admit this as Althair Bellhooks said, learning how to face our fears is one way that we embrace love. So maybe you are resolved to embrace love and to face the work in front of you. But however you show up here today, you are not alone. You have been sent here by the people of Georgia for a purpose to work for a better Georgia for all the people, all the people, all the people, inclusive of our economic status, our educational attainments, our gender, our race, our sexuality, our religion, our age, our backgrounds. Saint Irenaeus of Lyonce is attributed with saying, the glory of God is human beings fully alive. And so I invite you to see your work here as holy work, to bring delight to the divine by helping your neighbors find full, whole, real, happy life. May your work here today for the rest of your time in this house be to love your neighbors and to help them become fully alive, healthy, whole, and free. Friends, open the doors, see all the people and love your neighbors as you love yourselves. Even Jesus said that all the law and the prophets depend on this. Friends will you pray with me and let's stand. Friends let's take a deep breath together. Oh God of many names ever lasting an eternal one. We give you thanks for this day that you have made and for this world that you have made. God in this world, beautiful and terrible things can and do happen. Help us to not be afraid. We give you thanks for the mystery of our making, how you have made each of us uniquely and wonderfully and how you have brought all of us to this moment here together. A eternal and holy one work in all of us, in our minds and our hearts and our souls and our bodies work through us and in spite of us so that our great state may be ever more moderate, wise, and just through our actions and choices. God help us to love our neighbors, all of our neighbors, all of our neighbors. God help us to love ourselves which sometimes God is the hardest thing. God help us to love our enemies. God in power our mercy, open our doors, expand our minds and God break our hearts for all the people who are hurting and suffering lonely and afraid. Living one I close with these ancient words and ask that they might be an invitation for all of us. God be in our eyes and in our looking, God be in our mouths and in our speaking. God be in our hearts and in our thinking, God be in our head and in our understanding. God be at our end and at our departing. Amen. Friends, I would invite you to join with us as we pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands when we nation under the flag of the United States of America. Thank you. Thank you. Doorkeepers, you may unlock the doors. Thank you, Reverend Andy. That was a great message. Thank you for bringing that to us. We will ask members to join Reverend Andy in the south any room to give her a thanks for being here and have a photo if you would like.

you Members, our doctor of the day is brought to us by representative Estra Penich. Let's start the Deborah Martin. So when you get an opportunity to go by the aid station, say hello and thanks to Dr. Martin. Members, if I can have your attention just for a second before we move on to our next. Because I'm going to use this device. So members, if I can have your attention, for you members who've been here for a number of years, you may notice and recognize that ring.

This is the 100th anniversary of his birth and we're going to have Representative Tyler Paul Smith is going to speak to that in a few minutes, not right now. We get on the morning orders. But I'll let you hear it one more time. And if you can see what I'm looking at, he had great aim because this block is really damaged right in that spot where the gavel always hits. So we'll talk a little bit about Speaker Murphy in a few minutes. Thank you members. Chair recognizes Chairman Tarvan, the chair of the Committee on Information and Odits.

Chairman Petrie and Chairman Stevens, recognize for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, we light a recognize today. A couple of groups that are with us from Bryan County today, and I'm going to ask y'all to stand up, combat boots to the boardroom. Miss Lynetta Smith is here. This is a non-profit based out of Bryan County that helps veterans transition from military service into the workforce. We're proud to have them with us today. And also Prosper, which is a veteran and youth program. Y'all are here as well, right? We also have, lastly, a group of students from Bryan County, high school. They have anyone else here, right here? Very good. Great to have y'all here today. Welcome to the people's house. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Bryan County, a couple of good things going on in Bryan County. It's good to have y'all. We always like it when Southeast Georgia folks come to the Capitol. Hope you have a good day. Let us know what we need to do for you. Welcome. Representative Gilear and Representative Sharper. Chairman Gilear and Representative Sharper has recognized for a morning order. We're going to try to be brief. Thank you, Speaker. I want you guys to play it, pay a close attention to what we're talking about today. We're going to be recognizing core. And that is community organized relief efforts. And they are all over the state of Georgia. We're talking about the vaccines, COVID flu vaccines, the tests in 2020, April 2020. This group partner with our health departments all over the state to make sure y'all listen to these numbers about a half a million COVID-19 tests. Almost 600,000 COVID-19 vaccines were done. And they had over 141 mobile vaccination sites in up to 15 Georgia health districts. That's we're talking about all over. And another thing they have incentivized people to be able to come and get the vaccines and other services. About 7,000 gift cards have been given out with 800 incentivized events. They have 25 events weekly in you guys districts all over the state of Georgia. Core is an organization that we really need to partner with because they do so much not just for the COVID, but also when you have disasters, hurricanes, tornadoes in your community. Core is there. So before you leave today, they're going to go down to the ropes. I want you guys to go out, find out what districts are in and what district so they can know you. So we want to have a relationship with them. And we also have their staff here. We have a special team from Savannah to all the way from Savannah. We got Monique. We got Weston. We got Grace. And we have some of the others. But these are hard working people that I'm also of clinician with them. And I go all over the state to help get vaccinations and also other benefits. So we really appreciate you guys. And we thank you for what you've been doing since 2020. So y'all, let's welcome them to our Georgia House. We appreciate core. Thank you all so much. Thank you, Speaker. Thank y'all for what you've been doing and what you're continuing to do. Hard working Georgians. The gentleman at the well also fits that description. Represents sharper. I know this is a passion of yours. Thank you for your hard work and continued involvement in taking care of Georgia. I appreciate you. Representative O'laillet. Where's Representative Phil O'laillet? There he is. You're going to talk about kickball or something else? We're talking about kickball after we kick it again, right? And friends. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning colleagues. Today I have the honor of recognizing an incredible group of graduate students from Iowa, MoModern, the Harvard Kennedy School. They're traveling through Atlanta in a few other cities across the southeastern region, meeting with and learning from civic organizations, state and local officials. We had the pleasure of enjoying a 45 minute conversation about all things state government, public policy, and day in the life of a elected official. But if you all can please stand and colleagues, can you please give them a warm welcome to the people's house. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Are you the well welcome? Good to have you all. We appreciate you, Representative O'laillet. Chairman Hawkins recognized for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today in the house we have the North Hall Middle School Boys and Girls Track Team, each team won the state this year. And last year, two years in a row, one state middle school, full of incredible athletes. But one that I particularly want to mention is Summer Marlow. Summer won the school cross country nationals in Louisville, which she earned all American honors and finished third. In the state, she won the 3200 meter, the two mile, the 4K, and the 5K, came in first in all those races. She also came in second in the Olympics, National Olympics. So if you would give a hand of this team and especially to Summer, would y'all stand up please. Hope they're on your right. Way to go kids, two years in a row. Way to go. Way to go Summer. Chairman Noel Williams recognized for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, I would like to recognize leadership, Chris. If y'all would please stand, it's about 20 strong that I'm got up this morning, came up to the people's house and we appreciate y'all being here and just want to welcome y'all to Atlanta. Thank you. Good to have leadership, Chris, period. Thank y'all for making the trip. Representative Parrish recognized for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. So today is a PACE Center for Girls day at the Capitol, March the 11th. And we have some of them in the audience today. Ladies, if you all would stand. So PACE serves throughout the southeast with 23 communities across Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. They've cared for over 3,000 girls and their mission is that of counseling and education for high school girls and middle school, preparing them for careers, life skills, individualized development approaches based on each girl's unique strengths, life experiences and needs. So I want to really thank them for being here today. This is a very important organization. So important that March the 11th is PACE Girls Center for Girls day at the Capitol. Thank you all so much for coming and be with us today. Representative Doug Stoder recognized from a morning order. Give the gentleman the well, your attention please. General with a spend. Having too much fun on the front row I can tell already. Representative Stoder. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And those from the Cobb delegation that can join me this morning. I appreciate it. I want the House chamber here to recognize Miss Cobb County team for 2024. That is Carrington Manus age 15. If she can stand, thank you. Recognize her and she's going to be competing in June of 2024 for Miss Georgia team in Columbus Georgia. So for my colleagues from Columbus Georgia, they'll be coming down there in June 2024 to compete. Just a little bit about our representative here for the Miss Georgia team. She's her Vector Mother's here with her day. Shanteev, she can stand too. Come on mom, let's stand up. And just want to thank her and the stuff that Carrington's doing. She's a very involved young lady. She is a 10th grade honor student at Woodward Academy here in Atlanta, Georgia with the career ambition to come in attorney. So guess what? There's several attorneys here in this chamber. So you can come down here one of these days and join them. And then she's also a member of the team board for the International Disclixie Association of Georgia and a member of the Buckhead Atlanta chapter of Jack and Jill of of American corporate it. And in her spare time when she has any apparently, she can be found dancing competitively with her dance company, A-R-E-A, and debating with her school's debate team or riding her bike around Metro Atlanta with her family. So this is a busy young lady. We appreciate her being here today and thank you for all the work you do in our community. Thank you, Carrington. It's always good to have a queen in the house. Thanks for everything you're doing. That's awesome. What a great resume. I appreciate you. Thanks for coming down. We represent Gaines. Represent the Houston Gaines is recognized for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today there's members of the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology who are with us and in particular I want to recognize Ron Corson who is at the University of Georgia athletic department and just does a fantastic job for our student athletes at UGA. We also have Jonathan Kim. And earlier this morning Matt Ryan was here to raise awareness and spread the word about the great work that's being done, including Chairman Lee Hawkins bill that we passed earlier this session House Bill 874 to ensure AEDs are in our schools. And certainly I know for many of us this is an issue that's personal. My father had a heart attack two years ago and luckily survived that heart attack and just last week he spent five days in the hospital with another scare but I know for so many of us the work that you all do every single day so important. So thank you. Thank you Mr. Reposinities. Chairman Yurda recognized for a morning order. Thank you Mr. Speaker. We're pleased to have the Lee County youth ambassadors and they're up in the galleries. Y'all please stand up. They left Lee County, Mr. Speaker at five o'clock this morning so that was kind of double duty with the time chainings. So they all made it. The the Lee County youth ambassador program that powers youth to become change agents in their community. Each ambassador is a graduate of a five-month junior leadership academy program in their eighth grade year and they are currently ninth graders. These students will be engaged with the youth ambassador program until they graduate. The youth ambassador program is a collaborative effort between the Lee County family connection, Lee County school system, Lee County Chamber of Commerce, Lee County Library, City of Leesburg and the Lee County Board of Commissioners. This is a unique program that builds a connection in their community while building confidence and leadership skills. They provide they're provided opportunities to volunteer in the community and encourage to work and implement community projects and encourage civic awareness. The goal of the Lee County youth ambassador programs to create a culture of community commitment and also work coming with them or coming with them today, accompanying them with or Patsy James. Patsy is the Lee County family connection director, Yolanda Robinson with the Lee County school system, Lisa Davis who is the president of the Lee County Chamber of Commerce and Judy Powell which is on the City of Leesburg City Council. These are some of the hardest working ladies in Lee County. I can assure you and we're glad to have them. Let's give them a hand. Thank you all for coming. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Welcome to Lee County. Good to have you all in Atlanta. Thanks for good to have early and making a trip. Members that completes our morning orders believe it or not. We have one more special morning order. I want to ask the members to please come into the chamber and give the member in the way all your complete and full attention. Chairman Clay Perkel is recognized for a special morning order. Chairman Perkel, members if you'll give him your attention. How many bottles of water do you have? Well Mr. Speaker, I've got three of them up here. I hope I don't need quite all of them. I hope I don't get emotional at this. But I want to thank you Speaker that you didn't make me go after Representative Kinar the other day. He did such a good job. Be like following Representative of our Williams. But it is somewhat bittersweet. Most of you have heard that I did not qualify to run for reelection. And some of you might say that I have never been qualified to run for election. Not me. When I did qualify it was a calling. It's one of these last minute deals and I rushed to Atlanta. And honestly I did not know what being qualified to run for office mint. So on the way up I'm thinking of how many counties are there in the state. How many house reps are there? What are their terms? I was thinking of questions like an IQ test to qualify to run for office and I did not know if you had a pulse and 400 bucks you were qualified for this job. It has been an honor to serve with you. Each of us make sacrifices to play this role. Mine has been a shared one. My dad sailed to farm together for almost 10 years while I served here. My mom kept me engaged in the community. You know how moms do. Clay, you need to be at this festival. Clay, you need to go to this meeting. Clay, you need to be involved. And my wife, Sharon, she kept our home intact. Lots of sacrifice while I was up here. And not one time did she complain. She's very supportive in my endeavor. And though my kids are now grown, it has been the honor of my life to be their dad. Andrew, Vienna, and Nathan. It's been of their future that I have endeavored to make better. I just got to get to go back from Tennessee. Now Miss Penny, when she gave her address, and she is such a wonderful ambassador for us, she was right. It is about the people. It's the people's house, the people's chamber, servant of the people, the people's voice. The thing I'll care from this place is the people. Now it's right here that Abbey Day wrote that this is where I should say something great about her. So, Abbey, it is G-R-E-A-T and not G-R-A-T-E. I'm kidding. I just wanted more to fire. But seriously, Abbey Day in budget research, she is the best. She makes me look smart in my budget area. And I got to tell you that takes some doing. Abbey, I will miss you. But I digress. I want to talk about the people here. We often get a bad rap. Often when you hear politician, I got to tell you, we are seen only slightly better than trial lawyers. Slightly better. Sorry I had to do it. I thought it reforms on my mind. But let me tell you, when I got here, so I didn't know anybody. The first time I came to the capitals I swore in. That was my first time. I knew nobody here. And so my first week here, I got a text. I was on a long text thread with some guys back home that I'm in a bottle study group with. And I don't know if you know about these old text threads, but I rarely respond to them. Because they just aggravate. Somebody and then somebody and it just blows crazy. I responded so infrequently that they forgot I was on there. So I was up here. And my Bible study buddies, sent a text around. They said, guys, you need to pray for Clay's mom and dad. Just sent an ambulance to their house. Well, it's first I heard of it. So I immediately called my mom, called her phone. And my daughter was still visiting from Texas. And I said, baby, what's going on? She said, what do you mean? I said, well, Darden just kind of want to know what's what's going on. Anything exciting happening around there. Because she answered my mom's phone. She said, who you talk to? And I said, darling, you're my daughter. I need to know what's going on at home. She said, well, Granny, that's my mom. It's had a stroke. Slurring her words can't move her right side. And she said the ambulance is here. They're going to tell you the hospital. And I said, well, I'm on my way. And she said, Granny said, not to come. She said, some of you got momma's like that. She said, she knows you're busy. And she didn't want to bother you. I said, well, darling, I'm a grown man. I get to decide when I come home, check on mama. So that's not up to you anymore. I didn't know. Honestly, I thought she might not have to like punch a clock or something to get out of here and go home. Had no idea. And so I saw a couple of people and I said, listen, my mom's had a stroke. I'm headed home. And they said, of course, that's what you should do. So what I did not know, they didn't know me. Certainly didn't know mom. But they began to gather in groups to pray for my mom. I didn't know that. I took off, headed home, running probably a little fast. And I got most of the way home. And I called to check on my mama. And my daughter answered a phone again. And she said, you know, it's amazing that so apparently this drug did to give you when you have a stroke. It's kind of art and science. It's kind of both. So there's a golden window that you got to put it in. And if you give too much, you bleed out. If you don't give enough, then the clot sets. So we don't have a neurologist in Tifton. So she was on one of these telemedicine or zoom or some kind of call with Augusta. And then the call before they gave her a medicine. The clot spontaneously dissolves. Now she could talk, she could move. Now she's mad as a wet set in the end. They won't let her go home. She's just mad now. And so I call back. I call Bruce. He's one of the ones I talked to. I said, Bruce, listen, my mama's okay. I don't know. clot is gone. She can talk. She's mad. She's great. And Bruce said, don't let anybody ever tell you that miracles don't happen. He said, he told me that they had joined the together and began to pray for my mom. Touch me. He said, the fervent, effectual prayers.

of a righteous man, a velleth much. That is who I serve with. It's about the people. And you touch my heart. But it's more than that. It's about relationships. If the only people you interact with here look like you, vote like you, talk like you, you are missing a treat. For example, there's no one in this body that I have enjoyed sharing a meal with, or then representative of our Williams, and representative Mack Jackson, who is not in the chamber right now, my dad. And if you throw in Al's wife, it's Olivia, you got a real treat. She is a sport. She actually sent me a picture of her infamous pink tool belt that I've got on my phone, if you like, to see it later. But she's got to be a sporter. She's married to representative Williams, but the story is I can tell. It is just fascinating, and it's wild. Secondly, it's a little known fact that representative Long Tran, and not with Park, is actually the stunt driver in this body. He actually is a real-life stunt driver, and a wonderful guy. Representative DeMetius Douglas in the back. Few people know this. He has a smile that's actually watered in his face. Particularly when he embarrasses you while you're in the well. Weed Al sent me some, he showed me some thank you notes that some people, some students that have been up here in a debate the other day, and one of the top highlights was the Bridges comment that Representative Douglas bantered back and forth. But I love him, and I'm grateful that he likes me enough to pick it me a bit. Representative John Corbett's one of my closest friends here. And he is the top bill signer in this body. He can't say no. If you look at the number of bills he's coast sign, he is the top bill signer in this body. And he's the second best fisherman in the boat when he's fishing with LaRickia. So says Dominic. In fact, during COVID this spent so much time down at Lake Ufollow they could have voted in local shares race down there. Representative Jody Light came in with me, and we're going out at the same time. She is special. She also happens to be the only member of my coffee crew that I had never voted against the measure she had brought. Thankfully, last week, I was able to rectify that with a no vote committee on a bill that she brought that I just didn't like. Speaking of coffee crew, so we get here between five and seven every morning. Five, John Corbett, seven, Jody Light. We discuss upcoming bills and debate strongly. The issues that will make this state better. Representative Todd Jones is a member of that crew. He's an entrepreneur. He's an attorney. In fact, he hid that fact from the speaker for years because he didn't want to be on judiciary. Hey, man. He is a kind, trustworthy, and I got to tell you incredibly intense man who also happens to be the brightest light in any room. Speaking of bright lights, Representative Ridley. Ridley. He can be a tad bit rough around the edges, but he has a passion for Murray County and North Georgia Mountains that permeates his everybearing being. And he actually does study the bills he called last night talking about a bill that will be heard in committee this week. I will miss him. These reps that I mentioned are not nearly all of the characters in this body. I mean, not when you've got representative Alan Powell and Rick Jasper's amongst your members. The speaker and the broat team have both been very kind to me and allowed me to grow in roles that quite honestly might have been beyond my ability. But Terry England, the bottles for him, is a special man to me. He took a chance on me to handle, I think, the most important part of the budget. And he gave me rope with which to fashion. Chairman Hatchett as well. We've got characters all over. Many of you, as a look over this body, have made a positive impact on me. But these examples that I showed, shows that we have strength in our difference. From the Florida line to the North Georgia Mountains from the most rural to the most urban, one party to the other. The relationships that you cultivate serve to make this great state. I better place to live, work, and raise our families. It's about people. Man, it's about relationships. That's what I'll miss. I'm pretty sure I'm not agreed with everybody and on everything with each of the representatives that I've mentioned today. But in establishing friendships, we can agree that we can disagree and work toward a common goal on making our state better. My heart is full from serving with you. Thank you for investing in me. Congratulations. Applause Thank you, members, for your attention. Representing Clay Perkel. You certainly are a man of the house. There's no doubt about that. You're a man of the soil. There's no doubt about that. You're a family man. You love your children. Most importantly, you love your mom and daddy. But you're also a man of God. We love you and appreciate you. And we want you back anytime you want to join us. We thank you for your service. Godspeed. Members will move on to the rules, calendar. I'll let you know of the good work first of our Doctor of the Day, Dr. Martin. Our own representative, Spencer Fry, could have his hand this morning. And he's here. And on my orders, the doctor has sewed his hand up with no anesthesia. So we wanted to... But he's going to be fine. There it is right there. Five stitches. Our doctor and they took good care of him. So I hope you heal fast. Representing Fry. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Members, I'll ask you to help me welcome an old friend, representing Randall Mangum to my left. Let's give representing Mangum a warm welcome back to the house, former representative Randall Mangum. Good to see you, Randall. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Clerk, you're ready to captain the Senate bill 5050. The Senate bill 50 by Senator Burns, the 23rd, Dixon, the 45th, still the 48th and others to be entitled back to amend. Chapter 2 entitled 20 of the Efficient Go to Georgia, Annetteta, really an elementary and secondary education, shows to provide that local board's education, which operates a school with grades 9 through 12, may provide instruction in life guarding and aquatic safety. This bill I'm referring to the committee on education. That committee recommends the disbilled do pass by committee substitute. The House will come to order. We have several, several pieces of legislation where we'll take up. The members will give your attention to the lady in the well. If you have important conversations, take those conversations to the any room please. Representative Hagen is recognized to present Senate bill 50. Ladies recognize. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is Bill sponsored in the Senate by Senator Max Burns. It came over and made it through our Education Committee. And the clerk summed it up very well when he read the caption. Beginning in the 2026 school year, local boards of education may offer curriculum in life guarding and aquatic safety. This is not a mandate for local boards of education to provide this curriculum to their students and there certainly would be no requirement for a student to take this course. It would be a half hour credit as an elective if the local school board decided to offer it. The only agency that is required to do anything here is our state board of education. They would be required to adopt content standards for this curriculum by January 1st of 2026 and then beginning the following school year, it could be offered to local school board choose to do so. Mr. Speaker, that's the bill and I'll be happy to answer any questions if there are any. Lady has no questions. Thank you. I yield the well. She's yielded the well. And I ask for a favour consideration. I'm sorry I interrupted you. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Chair, here's none. The committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to a green to report of the committee which was favourable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. This bill now passed. All in favour of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machine. You'reaxe. Do I have all members voted? have all members voted. All members voted. It's so the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of Senate Bill 50, the yeas are 163, the nails won. This bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate Bill 335-335? Senate Bill 335 by Senator Albers, the 56th, the Robertson of the 29th, compared to the 32nd and others to be entitled back to amend code section 16, 622, the Fischercoda Georgia annotated relating to incest. So, as to expressly include relationship by adoption. This bill I'm referring to the Committee on Judiciary Non-Civil. That Committee recommends this bill do pass. Chair Lady Belinger has recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This bill simply allows for adoption to be included in the definition of incest. I'll be happy to stand for any questions. Lady has a question representing silcox to your right straight in the back. Just the general Lady Yield. Yes, she does. Chair and Belinger, is it not true that in Oxford, Georgia there was a couple that were arrested just last year for sexually abusing their adopted boys? That is correct. Thank you. And this will allow for better prosecution of those sorts of offenses. Thank you for bringing the bill. Thank you. To your left, Representative Tyler Paul Smith has a question for Lady Yields. Does the general Lady Yield for question? Yes, I do. Chair and Belinger, is it not true that the current definition of incest in Georgia's own covers, relationship by blood and not that of marriage, but not by adoption? That is correct. And this bill seeks to address that. Okay. Thank you. Lady has no further questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I urge your favorable consideration of this legislation. The Lady has yielded the well. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair, here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there an objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor, the passage of the bill will vote green. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? For what purpose is Representative Mary Francis Williams rise? Mr. Speaker, this bill is not in our book. And so it's not in my book, it's not in Representative Camp's book. And I would like to see it before I vote it on it. The Chair, Lady, will come over and speak to the representatives. We will pause just for a minute. Do the other members have a copy? Thank you for pointing that out. We're always want you to have a copy of the bill. We have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of Senate bill 335, the A's are 164, the A's are 0. This bill haven't received the requisite constitutional majority. Is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate bill 348? Senate bill 348, Senator Williams of the 25th, wants to do the first, according to the 30 second and others, be tauted back to amend code section 415, 1624, the official code of Georgia and Intiti relating notification of suspicious or unusual deaths. Court ordered medical examiner's inquiries and written report of inquiry. So as to revise the period for which an individual had not been seen by a physician prior to death, be considered an unattended death. This bill haven't referred to the Committee on Health. That Committee recommends the bill do pass. Chairman Corbett is recognized to present Senate Bill 348. Thank you Mr. Speaker, members of the House, I'll bring before you today Senate Bill 348 all that we're doing is changing the time from 180 days to 60 days for a person that passes away to be deemed to have died unattended by

The individual had not been seen by his or her position within 60 days of their death, then the medical examiner from their county would need to sign the death certificate. We're just changing who's able to sign that death certificate. And the example that Rick Williams used, he had a physical last June, perfect bill of health. November, he had a massive heart attack. He was still in that 180-day window, and it'd been up to the physician who would want to sign the death certificate under the old way. This puts it within 60 days. It also then, if someone in a long-term care facility, it makes that time, for like, 90 days, if they've not seen the physician in 90 days, the medical examiner's one to sign the death certificate. And that's all we're doing. The corners responsibility does not change, and the composite medical board is aware and approves this change. So, Mr. Speaker, if there are no questions, I would ask for everyone's favor consideration. Gentlemen, have a question. If you'll yield, I'll yield. Chairman Collins down the center aisle. It's a recognized for a question. Does my friend and the will yield? To my friend, I do. Is it not true that this bill is going to help with a lot of families in a difficult time, obtaining a district certificate in a more timely manner by passing this piece of legislation? It absolutely will. Thank you for the question. Thank you for bringing this. I yield a well, Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen, has no further questions. Is yielded the well? Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there an objection to agreeing to the report of the committee? What was favorable to the passage of the bill that Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? All members voted if so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of Senate Bill 348, the yeas are 163. The nay is one. This bill, having received a requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate Bill 370? 370. Senate Bill 370 by Senator Hodges, the third Watson of the first albors, the 56 and others to be entitled to amend Code Section 16, 547, the Fish Dakota, Georgia, and it's related to posting model notice with human trafficking, hotline information in business and on the Internet. This bill I'm referred to, the committee unregulated, industries that committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. Representative Suhong is recognized to present Senate Bill 370. Representative Hong. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. I bring you SB370 on behalf of the first lady. SB370 builds upon the first lady and the Grace Commission's efforts to combat human trafficking in our state. This bill will include and add convenience stores, body art studios, businesses that employ licensed massage therapists, manufacturing facilities and medical offices to the list of businesses that are required to post a human trafficking notice. As many of you know, the notice is a one page notice that has information and a hotline number and it can be downloaded on the GBI website. This bill will also allow the Georgia Board of Massage Therapists to initiate inspections to massage therapy businesses and it will allow and require therapy board members to complete a human trafficking awareness training. Lastly, it will require massage therapists to have their photo, a passport photo size, on their license to be displayed as well. I hope that you will join me in furthering our efforts to fight human trafficking in our state and vote yes. And I will yield for any questions, Mr. Speaker. Lady has no questions. Thank you. I yield the well. She's yielded the well. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee's substitute? Chair, here's none. The Committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the Committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. The report of the Committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. All members voted. All members voted. If so, the clerk will unlock the machine. On the passage of Senate Bill 370, the yeas are 164, the nays 1. This bill having to see the requisite constitutional majority is there for past. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate Bill 436-436? Senate Bill 436 by Senator Watson, the 11th Goodman of the 8th, Anderson the 24th, and others to be entitled back to amend part 1V of Article 13 to Chapter 6 and Title 40. The Fish Go to Georgia annotated related to operation of far muse vehicles so as to define the term. This bill I refer to the Committee on Motor Vehicles, that committee recommends the disbilled due pass by Committee Substitute. Representative Chaz Cannon is recognized to present the bill. Representative Cannon. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I bring to you Senate Bill 436 from the other body across the Capitol. Sponsored by Senator Sam Watson. The purpose of the bill is to clarify the definition of operator for any individual operating a farm. The operator or a farming implement along any highway in the state. If you travel down to Southwest Georgia, or mostly any rural part of the state, you'll likely come into contact with the tractor going down the road. And most of the time the farmer or the farmer's employee is operating that piece of equipment, which state law allows. But in some cases the tractor or piece of farm equipment will need a service or some repair parts or service call to a dealership. You need to be moved or it could need to be moved from one dealership location to another. And in those particular cases the farmer or the farmer's employee is not always the one operating the piece of equipment or the tractor. So what this bill does is simply clarify that if a mechanic or a sales rep that is authorized to move or retrieve a piece of the farm equipment, they would also be defined as an operator subject to the state statute. The bill received unanimous vote in the Senate and asked for your favor consideration this body as well. So that may speak our ear for any questions. You have no questions. You're the will. Gentlemen, as you're the will, is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there an objection to the committee adopting the committee substitute? Chair, here's none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there an objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of passage the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? All members voted if so. The clerk will lock the machine on the passage of Senate bill 436. The yeas are 165. The nays are zero. This bill haven't received the requisite constitutional majority. Is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate bill 421-421? Senate bill 421 by Senator Dixon of the 45th Albers, the 56th Capatric of the 32nd and others, be entitled to amend Article 2, Chapter 10 and Title 16, if you should go to Georgia and Attended Relating Ab obstruction of public administration and related offenses. So it's to enhance penalties for the offense of transmitting the false public alarm. Ms. Bill Edmund referred to the Committee on Judiciary Non-Civil Act Committee recommends this bill do pass by Committee substitute. Representative Matt Reeves has recognized to present the bill. Representative Reeves. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. House colleagues, Senate bill 421-sponsored by Senator Clint Dixon is a bill that will save lives in two important areas. It will strengthen our criminal laws against two offenses. Number one, swatting and number two, drive-by shooting. You may have followed the news reports shortly before we convene in January about swatting. That is a false report to law enforcement that is designed to provoke an armed response by law enforcement for the situation. There were several members of the Senate who were swatted. This is something that's been going on around the country. I believe there was a false emergency report one day at the Capitol as well. This bill criminalizes swatting and it will keep not only members of the public safe, but more importantly, it will keep our members of law enforcement safe so that they won't get called out to these incidents. Those folks will be behind bars who are doing the swatting. Secondly, drive-by shooting. This was brought up by a majority leader, Chuck Eftration, who himself was a former Gwyneth County prosecutor. There was a judge in Gwyneth as well as an assistant district attorney, Judge Warren Davis and Brandon Delphine. They showed that there were instances that the very general laws that drive-by shooting are currently prosecuted under some cases falling between the cracks. This gives some specificity to the instances of drive-by shooting at a house, at a car, at a building, and it will put those drive-by shooters who were overwhelmingly drug dealers and gang members. It will put them behind bars and make sure that George's law on drive-by shooting is complete and tough. I commend this to you, Mr. Speaker. I yield for any questions and ask for your favorable support. You have a couple of questions. Revolves into Holly to your left. Is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman you? I do. He's actually quite curious. You said that in Georgia that cases prior of drive-by shootings, they fell through the cracks by the prosecution. Could you give an example of a particular case that you know of where a person in Georgia who was arrested for a drive-by shooting was allowed to walk Scott Free? Yes. If you look at the three statutes in Section 1, criminal damage, assault and battery, and then the gang statute, they're very general. And in Gwyneth County, you were getting creative arguments about, well, I didn't know the house was occupied. I didn't mean to shoot at that. That was a ricochet. You have all sorts of things. So this makes it clear, do not shoot at a dwelling, do not shoot at a car. It gives some very specific laws. Brandon Delphine, that prosecutor who's now in private practice, he gave a number of examples. And then last year, when this bill was being considered a prosecutor with the Prosecuting Attorney's Council, came as well and gave some examples. And this is something that will make sure that those few people who are doing drive-by shootings are going to get convicted. Is this a gentleman for you? Yes. So in that particular case there, what was the sentence, or was there a conviction, or was there a sentence? What I remember is that one in case of very severe harm to a person's lives is being charged. In some way there's maybe an aggravated assault. There's other follow-up felonies that might be included in that. That's what this bill does. It adds a provision in the aggravated assault statute as well as criminal damage to property. And the gang statute, it just gives specific wording about, do not shoot from a car or get out of a car and shoot at a home and occupied building, things like that. Just lastly follow-up, what was the conviction of that person? No, that's the problem, both at the charge level and at trial with the jury charges, there's confusion about the laws being covered. This bill cleans that up and it gives some explicit law so that at the charging level out in the field with officers and the prosecutors as well as in the jury room with the jury charges you'll have specific law on point. Thank you. Thank you. Gentlemen, you owe for a couple more. Yes, Mr. Spieck. Chair Lady Silcox, to you right in the back has a question. Ladies recognize. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, I do. Isn't it true that new techniques like AI synthesize voices, collar, ID spoofing and IP masking have made swatting calls more efficient and even more of a headache for law enforcement? That is true, Vice Chair Silcox, and I appreciate your work on this bill and committee. And what this does, it gives a specific statute on swatting so that law enforcement can investigate an apprehend and punish criminals who are doing that. I thank you for bringing the bill. Thank you. Chairman Tyler Paul Smith to your left has a question. This gentleman yield. Absolutely, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Vice Chairman, is it not true that each swatting incident usually results in taxpayers footing a bill between $15,000 to $25,000? That's right, and there is a restitution provision in this law and that will make the swatters think twice about doing this in Georgia anymore. A couple more. Majority leader, you might be able to take this one. Has a question. The gentleman is recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speakers. Is the gentleman yield? Yes, Mr. Majority leader. Sir, isn't it true that often in our criminal code after we see the arguments made in court, we may need to come back and consider legislation to clear up the intent and make sure that the statute is clear for application in criminal cases? That's right. So, isn't it true that as to the drive-by shooting aspect of this legislation, drive-by shootings are incredibly dangerous, certainly for the victim who the shooter maybe is intending to hurt, but also for bystanders, other Georgians that maybe are just in the proximity to the crime as it occurs. And that we just saw that in the news recently with a three-year-old murdered in Athens due to a drive-by shooting and clearing up the statute is absolutely necessary to ensure that prosecutors and judges in the courtroom are able to accurately report on the law. That's right. Drive-by shooting in danger is the whole street when somebody is out there doing that shooting and it puts lives in danger and this bill cracks down on that. Gentlemen, has no further questions. Mr. Speaker, I yield the well and ask for your favorable consideration. Gentlemen, as you were the well, is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there an objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there an objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. All members voted. All members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of Senate bill 421, the yeas are 162, the days are 2. This bill, having received a requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Members, we postpone Senate bill 389. On Friday, we will do that again. We will postpone Senate bill 389 to the next legislative day. For what purpose is represented, Bonna rise? To make a motion? To state your motion. I move that the rules of the House be suspended so that the bill can be read and assigned to committee for the first time. That'll be just for a temporary time, right? Yes. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? Unnumbered House resolution by Reps. Bonna, the 73rd, and others creating a House Study Committee on Assistance programs for veterans applying for military benefits. On the general's motion, that the rules of the House be temporarily suspended so that the bill can be read for the first time and assigned to committee. Is the objection? Defense and veterans affairs? We have completed our rules calendar. We'll move on to afternoon orders. Chairman Carpenter, you'll make your way down. You'll recognize for an afternoon order.

We really had the best show team, but we didn't draw the best animals. And we did not win this trophy, y'all. Why not win this trophy? I had to go steal it from the Senate while I go. But I want to tell you, this is a great team and they had a lot of fun. And it was all about the young people that pair in the animals they show and the response feeling they take, raising that. And I was really proud of this team and really proud of that facility we have in Perry. It's first class, one of the best in the nation. And we're making it better thanks to Chairman Hatchett over there in this body, hopefully, building a new show bar in this year. But we're going to win this trophy next year. We're going to have five more of you next year showing and look forward to it. And just want to thank y'all, thank this team for your support and go house.
