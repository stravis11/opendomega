----------
House will come back to order. House will come back to order. Mr. Clark, you
want to ring the bell?
Okay, uh, Chair got a little over up to Mystical
over how long it would take all the paperwork to get ready.
But we are ready to go now and all of the paperwork
that you need, the calendars, copies of the bills
and everything are out back of the chamber,
out back of the gallery, out back of 3.41.
Go ahead and be getting those.
Park will read the caption to a group of privilege resolutions honoring the life and memory
of George Albert Gaines Jr.
in commanding six Samuel's dry cleaners, recognizing March 22 through 28, 2021 as World
Dulu Week, recognizing in commanding Dona Marie Butler-Harley, and for other purposes
of seconds, leads the reading of the Privilege Resolutions.
Is there any objection to adopting the Privilege Resolutions, the chair here is none, and the
resolutions are adopted we had one bill left on the earlier supplemental calendar
and that will uh, Senate Bill 255 clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 255.
Senate Bill 255, Senator Mulles, the 53rd Gouge, the 51st Bill, the 49th Dugan, the 30th
and others, the entitlement act to amend chapter 34,
title 50, the fiscal to Georgia annotated,
relating to the one Georgia authority act,
system five for grant program,
to support quarter region retail and tourism projects.
Let's build that, refer to the Committee
on Economic Development Tourism.
That committee recommends that this bill do pass
by rules committee substitute.
Chair recognizes Chairman Stevens to present the bill.
Thank you, Miss Speaker.
The latest gentleman, House, Senate Bill 255,
creates the Border Region Tourism Development Program,
which should be administered by the one Georgia authorities
to support border region retail and tourism projects.
Under the current law, the one Georgia authority
is there to promote the health, safety,
and economic security of rural citizens
in Georgia through development and retention
of employment opportunities in the rural areas
and enhance these infrastructures
and to accomplish this goal.
What this bill to create this border region,
retail tourism development program,
which is a mouthful,
and to award grants to help them in competition.
There's several things that this bill would require
for you to do before you could use one of these grants.
and it would be the number in types of jobs to be created.
The total private capital investment,
you'd have to provide the impact of the state,
the regional and community tax base.
It would require the degree of local commitment
for skin and the game.
In the bill, it originally had a succumbence
around the state to be within 10 miles.
We changed that to be within 25 miles of the border.
Mr. Speaker, this will be administered
through the One Georgia Program and the Governor
and the Commissioner of Economic Development
must approve these before the grants are awarded.
This is in addition to a statewide tourism development
program that we already have.
And recently, we've had cities like Claxton Douglas Field,
Jeff Davis-Takoa-Nunan, which is where Great Wolf came,
is another program for the development of these areas.
I hope you'll support the program and support House Bill,
excuse me, Senate Bill 255,
and if there's no questions, I'll yield the well.
You have a question if you're here to yield.
Oh, yeah.
Chair recognizes representative Meeks
up in the gallery to your left for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Does the gentleman yield?
I yield.
Just for clarification purposes,
does this program only relate to the counties
that are approved as a one Georgia recipient
under their current resources?
Yes.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Speaker, I yield the well and ask for your favor.
We'll consider it right.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
The chair here is none.
The previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to adopting the substitute
offered by the committee on the rules?
The chair here is none.
The rules committee substitute is adopted.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report
of the committee, which was favorable to the passage
of the bill.
The chair here is none.
The report of the committee has agreed to.
Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage
of the bill will vote aye.
those opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines.
All members voted, have all members voted, if so, the clerk will lock the machines.
On the passage of Senate Bill 255, the eyes are 157, the nays are six.
This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed.
to Senate Bill 235.
Senate Bill 235 by Senator Watson,
the first councilor to the 46th,
Harveston, the 15th, Kennedy, the 18th,
the Goodman of the 8th.
The Italian Act to amend Article 2,
Chapter 11 of Title 16,
where the official go to Georgia,
annotated a relay in the offenses
against public order,
so as to revise the offensive,
I'll see you'll see identity of the where.
Mr. Bill, I'm referred to the Committee
on Judiciary Non-Civil Act Committee
recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute.
Chair recognizes the chair of the Judiciary Non-Civil
Committee Chairman, Bershett, to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I'm a little bit out of breath.
I just took the trip from up in the gallery
and it was running a little bit late, so.
This is a fairly quick bill here.
Currently in the state of Georgia,
it's a legal to wear a mask.
And if you look around at each and everybody in here,
we've got a lot of lawmakers in here.
So what this bill does is it makes it legal
when there is a pandemic or a scenario such as the one
we're in now, to wear a mask.
And that's all the bill does.
It makes it legal to wear a mask in a case
where we have a state of emergency
and we have a virus like we do have now.
And with that, I'll yield the will for questions.
If necessary, Mr. Mayor.
Do you yield for questions?
Yes, sir.
Chair, recognize his representative,
Eric Atomis, to your left for a question.
Does the gentleman yield?
Yes, ma'am.
Is it not true that the reason why we had a mass mandate
while it was illegal to wear a mask is due to the Ku Klux Klan?
Hi, I don't know if that has any relevance to this statute here.
What we're doing here is making it legal to wear the mask
that you're wearing currently.
Can the gentleman further you?
Certainly.
Again, to my point is in history of America
and the history of this state capital,
which was built on my forefathers that built this,
but that was not able to even come into this capital,
even though they built the capital,
that this mandate, we hope,
was because of the clan wearing masks,
and because of people running up to you
in a robbery situation, and I yield.
Well, as I understand the law, as it's written now,
it's for concealing your identity
in the commission of a crime.
So I'm gonna have to leave the rest to the lady.
Do you further yield?
I do.
Chair recognizes representative Wynn
to your left in the gallery.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Does the chair yield?
I don't need to yield. You need to ask the gentleman in the well.
Oh, I'm sorry. Does the gentleman in the well yield?
Yes.
I just wanted to clarify that this bill wouldn't have any prohibitions as it pertains to religion in the wearing of something like a burka.
As I understand it, the federal law gives many protections for religious rights and wearing of a Berkha.
I think you and I are actually representative Lopez and I have discussed this at length and I don't believe this bill touches that in any way.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
With that, I'm going to yield the well, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you.
is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none.
The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute?
The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing

here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All
All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye.

have all members voted have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the
machines on the passage of senate bill 235 the eyes are 166 the nays are 1 this
bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is there for
past. Clerk will read the caption to Senate bill 60. Senate bill 60 by
representative by senator Thompson the 14th alvers of the 56th most of the
53rd robbers in the 29th painting the 54th and others being titled
an act to amend part one of Article 5 of Chapter 9 of Title 45.
The official go to Georgia annotated relating the Georgia State indemnification fund.
So it was revised one indemnification shall be paid in instances of a heart attack stroke or vascular rupture.
Ms. Bill, I've heard the Committee on Public Safety and Homeland Security.
That committee recommends that this bill do pass.
Chair recognizes representative gravely to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I'm ready to send a bill 60.
Very quickly, several years ago in Polding County in Hiram,
we had a fire.
All units responded.
And a man by the name of Kevin Van Dyke,
long time firefighter in our community,
aspirated during that fire, had a heart attack.
had Firefighter Van Dyke passed away,
his family would have received no death benefit.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have firefighters and public safety
personnel across the state that go out and put
themselves in emergency situations day in and day out.
One of the firefighters is turned back to the station,
undoing his gear, had a heart attack and died.
That was not covered in the indemnification.
All SB 60 does is that connects us, ties us to the federal, matches us to the federal
indemnification fund, where if a firefighter or public safety personnel in this state has
a heart attack, a stroke, or a vascular rupture within 24 hours of that type of rescue situation
or imminent danger situation that their families would be able to benefit from the indemnification
fund.
for questions. You have no questions. Thank you, Ms. Speaker. Is there any objection to the previous question?
I'm sorry. We have another speaker. Yes. It means overlooked you. Chair recognized his representative camp to speak to the bill.
Thank you so much, Mr. Speaker.
This bill could be called the Lieutenant Bobby Patrick Bill.
My brother-in-law was a firefighter in Gwinnett County.
And on April 14, 2003, he went to a fire.
He was on the roof of the fire.
And he had a heart attack.
Sadly, his team was unable to revive him.
But because he passed away, because of a heart attack,
The Georgia State Demonification Fund did not pay his family anything.
He had been a firefighter for almost 30 years.
I stand here in support of this bill because that $150,000 would have made a world of difference
to his family.
So I ask for your support on this bill.
I yield the well.
The lady is yielded the well.
Now, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered to chair here's none
the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee,
which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee
has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote
aye. Those opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines.
What purpose does the rules chairman rise?
The speaker percent to rule 133, I ask to be excused from this vote.
Gentlemen has that right and the journal will so reflect, have all members voted, have
all members voted.
So the clerk will lock the machines on the passage, Senate Bill 60.
The eyes are 167.
The nays are zero.
This bill, having received the requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed.
Clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 78.
Senate Bill 78 by Senator Jones,
the 22nd Anderson, the 43rd Hill,
with 40th and others to be titled
and act to amend part three of Article 3 of chapter 11
to title 16.
The official code of Georgia annotated
relating the invasion of privacy
so as to revise the prohibition on electrically,
electronically transmitting or posting
new to sexually explicit photographs or videos.
This bill I've referred to the committee on,
the judiciary non-civil that committee
recommends that this bill do pass by rules committee substitute chair recognizes
representative Tyler Paul Smith to present the bill representative please speak
where I can understand you okay yes sir mr. Speaker I will try to not see
the best I know how. Mr. Speaker, members of this August, by the
coming for you again, bringing to you the rule substitute to SB 78. I just want
to say on the forefront, I appreciate all of the staff members that have
worked to make sure that we iron this out right as it should be ironed out
and appreciate the use of our commas.
If you don't believe that commas make a difference,
well, I can assure you that they do.
This bill is actually amending our code
dealing with the uploading of explicit content
on adult entertainment websites
that show explicit material.
This bill would actually put more teeth in our statute
for those that would upload or transmit these explicit
materials that they receive without the consent
or approval of those sending it to them
and uploading it to an adult entertainment website
or a medium that is used to upload this kind of explicit
material.
For that offense, you would now be charged
with a felony under this bill while we still
keep in the statute, the Mr. Men in our offense.
For the Mr. Men in our offense,
that would cover conduct as far as, for an example,
someone receiving something,
via text, explicit material,
and then transmitting that explicit material
to another person's phone,
a Facebook post, Instagram post,
or even Snapchat or Instagram.
So I bring this before you today,
We needed to put some more teeth in this statute.
It was a little bit vague as to what material this would cover.
And this specification has been a great addition
that I hope that you all support with your yes vote.
And Mr. Speaker, I'll yield for any questions.
You have a question if you care to you.
I'll yield, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes Chairman Sensler
to your right for a question.
Mr. Jimmie, you'll not do.
So just to be clear, this keeps the penalty
The misdemeanor, if these pictures are shared with just friends or people, but if you
load it into a commercial website where hundreds of millions of people can see it, that's
what makes it a felony, correct?
That is correct, Mr. Chairman.
Note that the misdemeanor still, misdemeanor of a high and aggravated nature, that's not
just your regular misdemeanor, this is the increased misdemeanor pill on it, penalty.
And then the felony provision, you have to have the intent to upload that material to
a website or a medium that actually does this for a living.
It's advertised.
They do advertising.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
No further questions.
Thank you, Ms. Speaker.
Well then, I ask for this body's favourable consideration and I will yield well.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
The chair here is none.
The previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to withdrawing the committee substitute?
The Chair here's none, the committee substitute is withdrawn.
Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules?

Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable
to the passage of the bill?
The Chair here's none, the report of the committee is agreed to.
Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill?
We'll vote aye, those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machines.
Have all members voted?
Have all members voted?

The eyes are 169.
The nays are zero.
This bill, having received the requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed.
bill 95 was on the calendar earlier today. It failed to receive the requisite
constitutional majority. This House reconsidered its action in failing to give
that bill a constitutional majority. It went back to the general calendar and
is being called at this time the clerk will read Senate bill 95. Senate Bill 95
of our Senate again to the 47th,
beech to the 21st Alvers of the 56th Senate in DeBarte,
to the 31st, Kripatrick to the 32nd and others,
to be entitled an act to amend, title 50.
The official go to Georgia,
annotated relating to state government,
so it's to provide conditions,
for meetings and public hearings.
This bill doesn't refer to the committee on government affairs,
that committee recommends this bill do pass
by committee substitute.
Chair recognizes Chairman Allen Powell to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen, first I do want to thank everybody
for giving me an opportunity to bring this bill back to you to be sure there was no misunderstanding
about the law of this thing.
Bottom line, this bill passed with pretty good numbers the first go around.
When we came out and went through the process, we did raise the commission to the lottery.
What this building is really all about, ladies and gentlemen, is about putting some teeth
into the management of an industry that serves a state.
A lot of people have different views about this industry,
but this is not gambling because gambling
is the paying out of cash.
And that's the one thing that we've always
tried to do in this, in trying to move forward
to control this industry, to take that human element
of violating the law in the paying out of cash.
As I said earlier that we put certain criteria in that they're both the retailers and the
masters that they'd be able to give or they would have to give more credentialed information
to the lottery so they could scrutinize these operators even more.
We also did the gift cards and I've talked about this time and time again but the gift
cards, once upon a time they were able to do gift cards and at that time a lot of the
cash payouts went downhill considerably. Now, what that gift card does, and I'll say this again,
it takes the rationale away from any retailer to pay out cash. And what it also does,
it brings in, supposedly, we're bringing more monies into the coffers of the lottery,
as well as to these retailers and the masters. But also, it'll bring in a ton of money into
the state sales tax coffers, quite frankly. So, you know, these are the things that this bill
does. The most importantly, what it does is it helps to increase the rate for where the
lottery will be getting more money, and it also makes a cleaner business out of it. That
Mr. Speaker is what this bill does, and I would certainly appreciate your favorable consideration
to this bill. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous
question being ordered? The Chair here is none, the previous question is ordered. Is there
any objection to withdrawing the committee substitute? The Chair here is none. The committee
substitute is withdrawn. Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the
committee on rules? The Chair here is none. The rules committee substitute is adopted.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable
to the passage of the bill?
The chair here is none.
The report of the committee has agreed to.
Shall this bill now pass?
All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye.
Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines.
What purpose does representative Paris rise?
Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Secretary.
Mr. Speaker, does this bill not say to us that these co-ems are definitive drain on our
communities?
You can't sweeten this issue and that we just need to outlaw them all together.
It's like putting lipstick on a pig.
Thank you.
Lady is certainly entitled to that opinion. What purpose is representative McLaren rise?
Probably very great nature inquiry. Mr. Speaker, isn't that true that the public meetings topic is too far a really removed from the coin
Operated machines topic for this bill to be constitutional under the constitutional mandate that top that bills have the same subject matter
I think that's something that each member will have to form their own opinion about
Well, what purpose does representative Sains rise?
Parliamentary inquiry.
Is it not true that I reviewed if there's been any bills that have passed to eliminate
this system and there has not been this session and this is the only bill that rectifies
a system that doesn't allow Georgia citizens who take part in this to use their winnings
for productive purposes like the lottery and that we have our taxpayers pay for a great
legislative council who would issue a statement saying if something is unconstitutional
and they have not?
I'm sure the gentleman believes that to be true.
All right, we're going to go ahead as all members voted.
Have all members voted.
If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of Senate Bill 95.
The eyes are 100.
The nays are 67.
This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed.
We're going to bring the caption to Senate Bill 81.
Senate Bill 81 by Senate Revolves the 53rd Miller of the 49th Anderson and the 43rd
Dugan of the 30th Walker, the 20th and others.
We need to add an act to amend Code Section 2437 in fiscal to Georgia annotated relating
to the Office of College and Career Transitions and Powers and Duties, so it's the change
to the name of the Office of College and Career Transitions to the Office of College and
Career Academies.
This bill I'm referred to the committee on higher education that committee recommends that this bill do pass
By rules committee substitute chair recognizes chairman martin to present the bill
Thank you mr. Beaker ladies and gentlemen. I'll try to be brief the hours late Senate bill 81 comes you out of the higher education committee
It does in section
1.3 of the bill it seeks to change the name of the office of college and career transitions to a
academies, and later in the bill, update that again, and on line 68, add technical skills
needed to work.
Basically, we're trying to get Jordan's ready to get into the workplace.
In addition, this bill has in section 1-1 and 1-2, and 2.1, the contents that passed this
house on February 11th, that were at that time called House Bill 67, the University
carry over language. Those items passed 171 to nothing. The only thing that's been added
to that language is additional reporting language that is I draw your attention on line 24
through 30 and again on lines 39 through 45. So this is the original bill, a very simple
bill out of the Senate to rename the college of transitions to academies and to place
House Bill 67 on there so that we make sure we take care of the universities as this house
did on February 11th, 171 to nothing. If there are no questions, Mr. Speaker, the hour's
late and I'd ask the House's favorite questions.
Thank you.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none.
The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered
by the committee on rules. The chair here is none. The rules committee substitute is adopted.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable
to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed
to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote
aye. Those opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines.
,
If so, the clerk will lock the
machine on the passage of Senate Bill 81.
The eyes are 164.
The nasor zero.
This bill having received the requisite constitutional
majority is therefore passed.
It's about time again.
Clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 100.
Senate Bill 100 by Senator Watson, the first dude in the 30th Kennedy the 18th
Miller the 49th hour the 48th and others to be titled an act to amend chapter
one in title 50 the Fisherhood of Georgia annotated relating the
general provisions for a relative state government so it's provided that
this state should observe standard time year round until such time that's as
Congress authorizes the states to observe daylight savings time. Chair recognizes
Representative Cantrell to present the bill.
Colleagues, I want to apologize that we're having to spend more time on this subject.
Unfortunately, the Senate made light of the bill, which we sent to them a couple of weeks
ago, House Bill 44, which would have taken Georgia to permanent daylight saving time, pending
congressional approval.
So Senate Bill 100, which they sent our way, has now been substituted with the language
of House Bill 44, that we passed out of this chamber a few weeks ago, which would take
our state to permanent daylight saving time pending congressional approval.
A couple of things, the Senate has recognized the error of their ways.
When they passed SB 100, the outrage was tremendous because most people prefer permanent
day-like saving time over permanent standard time.
In fact, Politico did a nationwide survey just a couple of
weeks ago, primarily about President Biden, but in it they
slipped in a question about day-like saving time and the margin
was over five to one people preferring day-like saving time over
standard time. And I want to remind this chamber that if
our state does not pass this bill and Congress
gives the states the ability to make this decision.
Florida, South Carolina, Tennessee, Louisiana,
and Arkansas will all go to permanent standard time,
and Georgia will be the odd man out.
So I want to encourage you to vote for this bill again
as you did last time, and let's send it back
over to the Senate.
I'm told that they have recognized
the air of their ways, and they will agree
to the changes that we have made to their bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I'll be happy
You'll for questions that there are any do you feel for a question certainly chair recognizes chairman p3
Do you are left for a question? Thank you, mr. Speaker
Representative I just want to be clear in the original version of
SB
100 it was a step
To daylight savings times first through daylight
standard time or through each. Through standard time.
Standard time. Will you make it clear that this bill does not move us to
standard time. That's accurate. The Senate bill moved us to permanent
standard time until Congress gave us the approval to go to daylight saving
time. The bill that you see before you today has changed that to be clear to
to move us to permanent daylight saving time pending
congressional approval.
Once the Congress gives us the authority to do so.
And with that, Mr. Speaker, I will yield the well.
Gentlemen, as yielded the well,
is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
The chair here is none.
The previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute?
The chair here is none.
The committee substitute is adopted.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable
to the passage of the bill?
Chair, here's none.
The report of the committee has agreed to shall this bill now pass.
All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye.
Those opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine.
What purpose does representative Mitchell rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not true that
the majority of letters I received about this legislation come from parents who are
concerned about their children getting on the school bus in the dark in the morning?
If the lady so states, have all members now voted? Have all members voted? If so,
The clerk will lock the machines on the passage of Senate Bill 100.
The eyes are 111.
The nays are 48.
This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed.
We have two local callups, two supplemental local calendars, two of them.
of the bills on the supplemental local calendar. It's on local calendar. Supplemental calendar
number two relates to homestead exemption and requires a recorded two-thirds roll call
vote for passage. If there is no objection, we will vote on both the supplemental local
calendars together and as a whole with a recorded vote. Hearing none it is so
ordered the clerk will read both supplemental local calendars. Senate bill
209 by Senator Jones the 10th to Cab County Senate bill 295 by Senator
Gouge the 51st City of Cleveland Senate bill 297 by Senator Miller the 49th
Hall County Senate bill 275 by House substitute by Senator Thompson the
14th Bartow County.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered on both the supplemental local
calendars?

Chair recognizes Representative Williamson for a motion.
Mr. Speaker, I move that the House agree to the Senate substitute to House Bill 150.
Representative Williamson has moved that this House agree to the Senate substitute to
House Bill 150, the clerk will read the caption.
House Bill 150 by Representative Williamson of the 115th hatch of the 150th Kelly, the 16th
and others to be tall and act to amend title 46.
The official go to Georgia annotated relating
to public utilities and public transportation.
So it's a prohibit.
Governmental entities from adopting any policy
that prohibits the connection or reconnection
of any utility service.
Chair recognizes Representative Williamson
to explain the Senate substitute.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
The Senate simply added a clarifying language
that this bill also included heating oils
that are principally used to fire bores
that run circulating hot water through homes
and also to businesses that use bores.
Some of them are fired by what I call home heating wall
but this is heating wall.
So that's the essence of the change.
Importantly, on lines 25 and 26,
says nothing in this code section
limit the ability of a government entity to choose utility services for
properties owned by such government lender entity. So Mr. Speaker, that's what it
does. Are they happy to answer any questions or yield the well for your
favor and ask for your favor consideration?
You have no questions. On the gentleman's motion at the House agree to the
Senate substitute to House Bill 150. All those in favor, opposed to vote
know and the clerk will unlock the machines.
Have all members voted?
Have all members voted?
If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 150.
The eyes are 107.
