----------
Good evening. Tonight, President Trump spoke directly to the people of this great nation
and told them what many Americans are already feeling, that the state of our union is strong
and optimism is growing by the day. In November, President Trump was giving an overwhelming
mandate to make America great again. His address laid out the bold vision for the future,
one rooted in the principles that have always made this nation great, strength, freedom,
economic prosperity. Georgia Republicans stand united in support of his agenda, and we
are already hard at work to make the great American comeback a reality. President Trump
spoke of an America that puts its citizens first, an America where the government serves
the people, not the other way around. For too long, Washington has function as a bloated
bureaucracy, wasting our hard-earned tax dollars on inefficiency and overreach.
For many Americans across the country, the President's commitment to a more limited,
common-sense government has restored faith in our institutions, and the idea that government
accountability is not only possible, but necessary.
Georgia Republicans are following suit by passing efficiency measures for our own legislation
that slashes red tape, restores accountability in our state government.
And on the economy, the president outlined a plan to keep America thriving.
You know, under his leadership, we've already seen a resurgence of optimism, business investing,
jobs returning, and families keeping more of their paychecks.
Like President Trump, Georgia Republicans have delivered on historic income tax reductions,
putting over $6 billion of taxpayer money in the hands of hardworking Georgians.
That's because Georgia Republicans believe that your tax dollars are best kept in your
pocket because that's your money, not the government's.
As a successful businessperson, President Trump understands that economic strength is foundational
to our success.
Under his leadership, we will ensure Georgia's success will not be undermined by foreign
adversaries or misguided policies drafted by Washington bureaucrats.
The vision of former Governor Deal and conservative leadership of current Governor Brian Kemp
have made Georgia the number one state in which to do business for 11 consecutive years.
President Trump's return to the White House will bolster our efforts significantly.
The economic priorities of the Trump administration will send a signal to all Georgians that the
The best is yet to come.
The America last policies, the Biden administration, that have crippled the American farmer and
American worker are no more.
President Trump will deliver on his promise to be tough on unfair and deceptive trade practices.
Georgia businesses are begging for a level playing field.
In Georgia, in President Trump's trade policies, we'll put hardworking Georgians and America's
industry first.
Agriculture is Georgia's number one industry and our farmers deserve a truly competitive
market to bring their products to feed the American family.
President Trump and Georgia Republicans will fight to ensure that tariffs protect American
industry, that deregulation unleashes our entrepreneurs and that our vast energy resources power
our state and our nation into a new golden age.
leadership in the White House, and the governor's mansion, and the Georgia Senate, will keep
our state the best place to live, work, and raise a family for many, many years to come.
Now let's be clear, the road ahead will not be easy.
The Democrats will resist us.
They'll cling to their tired old ideas of bigger government, open borders, and weakness
abroad.
But tonight President Trump showed us a better way, a way that listens to the forgot
not men and women of this country, not the coastal elites or the Washington insiders.
Republicans in Georgia are ready to turn his vision into action.
We won't just cheer from the sidelines, we're going to roll up our sleeves and we're going
to get to work.
To the people of Georgia and Americans across this great country, this is your victory.
You voted for a change in November and President Trump is delivering on it.
promises made and promises kept. You demanded a government that respects our values,
protects our families and secures our future. Tonight you heard a president who
gets it, a leader who speaks your language and fights your fights. Georgia
Republicans are committed to being your voice, your shield, and yes your
partners in this historic moment. Four years ago President Trump promised to
make America great again. He kept that promise then, and he's keeping it now.
Together with his leadership and our resolve, we will build an America that is even stronger,
prouder, and more united than ever before. May God bless this great state of Georgia,
and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you.
