TRANSCRIPT
----------
I am Senator Shelley Eckles, and I would like to thank you all for attending the reapportionment and redistricting committee meeting today.
I will now call this meeting in order, and I would like to ask our pro-TEM if he would open this meeting as we do all of our Senate meetings with order prayer.
We have it too. Thank you.
What number are you?
Number nine.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and if everyone, if you would, now with me.
Heavenly Father, we've come to the Capitol today to begin a process of doing the work for
the people that we represent.
Thank you for giving us that privilege.
Please be with each of us individually and collectively as we make important decisions
for our own constituents and the state as a whole.
Please forgive us of our sins and help all those that are less fortunate and those that
are in need.
In Christ's name, amen.
First of all, I'd like to thank some people for the work they've done to help prepare
this map.
Our state map drawer, Gina Wright, thank you so much.
She spent a tremendous amount of time with me and vice chair Hatchet.
expertise and wealth of knowledge have been invaluable. Thank you to
Vice Chair Hatchett. We've made some trips to Atlanta and we've spent a lot of
time together and I've appreciated your help and assistance and it's been a
pleasure working with you. Thank you to this committee for your
dedication. We have a few long days ahead of us and I want to thank you for
your willingness to serve. Thank you to the senators who have given their time
to meet with me to discuss your districts. I learned so much about your
districts in those meetings and I appreciate your willingness to have open
conversations with me about the process. Thank you to the public who have
chosen to attend this meeting today. Your participation in the hearing is
vital and I appreciate your attendance and participation. In your folder
members you will find a few documents. The first thing we need to do just
Because we're in a special session,
I'd like to re-adopt our committee rules.
So I'll enter, it's the same rules
that we adopted last time,
just like to re-adopt those for this special session.
Madam Chair, that was fine.
I think that's entirely in order.
And I would like to make the motion
that we adopt the rules as you have proposed
in the folder and the same ones that we had from session
in 2023 to be the rules governing us
during the special session for this committee.
Okay, thank you.
I have a motion in a second.
Thank you.
Okay, so we'll vote on those rules all in favor.
Raise your hand.
All of those opposed, raise your hand.
Thank you.
The next order of business is to adopt our guidelines
and you find a copy of those in your packet as well.
These are the 2023-24 guidelines
for the Senate reapportionment and redistricting committee.
And this just lays out the process
that we have followed in drawing these maps.
And it's the same set of guidelines
that the House reapportionment and redistricting committee
will be approving as well.
And at this point, if there is emotion,
I would entertain that.
So many.
We have emotion in a second.
All of those in favor of adopting these guidelines,
please raise your hand.
All of those opposed.
Thank you.
All right, Leader Butler, I just wanted to confirm that you want to present your bill
tomorrow.
Is that correct?
And what number are you?
Yes.
12.
12.
You said that is correct.
That's correct.
Okay, so tomorrow we will hear your presentation of your map that you would like to present
to the committee.
Thank you.
Thank you.
All right.
A little bit of history about the map drawing process.
We began by carefully reviewing Judge Jones's order.
The order was very specific about what needs to be done in the Senate.
And to quote page 509 of his order, the remedy involves two additional majority-black Senate
districts in South Metro, Atlanta.
Judge Jones also noted that the district's drawn by the various plaintiff experts overlapped
in some areas. Shortly after Governor Camp called for a special legislative session, I sent
out emails to every senator from the affected areas to meet because of the short amount
of time that we had to prepare for this session. I allocated several days to be at the capital
and even more days to meet virtually. I met with one member at 730 in the morning
at the Capitol. I talked to one member while I was at a EGA football game. My husband wasn't
so happy about that. I would like to thank Senator's Dugan, Strickland,
Say, Anderson, Harbin, James, Davenport, Jones, and Rhett for taking the time to talk and
meet with me. Your discussions were very helpful, especially when I found out that one member
had moved and we didn't have their correct address. We consulted with legal
counsel and began drawing districts with Gina Wright in her office. Now by
chairman Hatchet I'll turn it over to you if you would like to make any comments.
Thank you Madam Chair. I just wanted to welcome you all. Thank you guys for
coming and being a part of this process. As the Madam Chair said earlier this
This has been a process, and when we first sat down to draw the maps, there were several
things that we considered.
Number one, obviously, is the judge's order.
And because we had maps previously drawn, we didn't have to start from square one.
We had an order to go by.
We made sure to comply with his order, the Boating Rights Act, the traditional redistricting
principles and then we met with Senate members whose districts would be impacted on both
sides of the aisle. It was eye-opening to me every member that we met with had the same
request. Keep my district exactly the way it is. I like the way my district is drawn.
And so we have the judges order on one hand telling us we've got to redraw these and members
on the other hand, saying, keep my district the same.
So it was a challenge, but in response
to those conversations, in response
to the judge's order and our traditional principles,
we believe we drew a map that affected
as few districts as possible.
And I look forward to hearing public comment
about this map and seeing this map through the process.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
After meeting with those members, we first drew with Gina Wright in her office the new
majority black districts that were required by the order in South Metro, Atlanta.
Those districts are 28 and 17 on the plan in front of you members.
With that configuration, almost all of the black voters covered by the areas in the Planets
Experts districts in those areas are included in a majority black state senate districts.
The only area not included is Griffin, but that area wasn't included in the majority
light district for one of the plain experts plans either.
Placing districts in south part of Metro Atlanta meant that other districts had to move north,
you can think of that as a simple ripple effect of moving districts.
As a result, majority white senate district 42 moved from the northern part of the cab
to Eastern Metro Atlanta and Majority White Senate District 6 moved from the northern
part of Fulton County to Western Metro Atlanta.
In the proposed Senate plan, the Senate plan involves changes to 15 districts and all
of those are in Metro Atlanta.
The second page of your packet includes a plan where the only districts displayed are
the districts that are changed.
So if a district doesn't appear on that page, it didn't change.
Our primary goal in creating this district plan is to comply with Judge Jones' order
in every respect.
I told every member that I met with that my primary goal is simply to comply with the
Georgia's order.
After drawing the districts required by the court order, we then followed our existing
traditional redistricting principles to work on the remaining districts.
These principles included maintaining district populations so that deviations from the ideal
district size are less than 1% to comply with the U.S. Constitution requirement of one person
one vote.
Limiting additional split counties by only adding one additional county split.
Drawing the new districts utilizing the most recent precincts from county governments.
Some counties that they voted their voter precincts this summer and these maps recognize
those new county voting precincts. Ensuring all districts are contiguous. Ensuring all districts
are reasonably compact in shape. Ensuring communities of interest are protected as far as possible.
Many of you described these in our meetings. Your input was invaluable in with that.
We also made sure to avoid the unnecessary pairing of incumbents by ensuring that every incumbent
that Senator of both parties is not paired.
As part of our efforts to ensure every incumbent Senator
had a district to run in and to win in,
we also work to maintain the continuity
of representation as much as possible,
which involved partisan political considerations
to ensure that the Senate plan remained balanced
between political parties as it was in 2021.
This means we also used extensive partisan data,
including election returns from 2018, 2020 and 2022.
So I'm going to discuss now the two districts
that had the most change.
Senate District 17 is one of the new majority black districts
required by the court order.
It's located at almost exactly the same location
as the plaintiff's experts districts in this area.
And I have a map of one of the exhibits,
of both of the exhibits over here behind the committee.
The district contains the Panhandle
and Southern part of Clayton County
combined with most of Stockbridge and McDonough.
The district includes all of Hampton as well.
Judge Jones relied on the inclusion
of most of McDonough, Locust Grove and Hampton
in the same district for this area in his order
on pages 285, 286, and 316.
The district boundary of district 17
Match those communities centered on McDonough.
This district boundary has only a single incumbent
and that is Senator Davenport.
Senate District 28 is the other new majority black district
required by the court order.
The plaintiffs experts drew this district
in two different places.
One expert anchored the district in South Fulton
as we have done here.
The other expert utilized populations
from district 16 and district 34,
which resulted in higher black voting age population
percentages in adjoining districts.
District 28, as proposed, is anchored in South Fulton County
where one of the plaintiffs districts was
and ensures that black voters in Fulton, Fayette,
and Clayton counties are all in majority black districts.
District 28 also relies on some of the same highways
and healthcare system Judge Jones relied on
at pages 325 and 326 of the order.
The district includes part of the city of South Fulton and moves north into
all-stale. All areas that Judge Jones found to share strong connections at
pages 190 and 191 of his order. The district connects a number of suburbs around
Metro Atlanta that are all experiencing growth and our diverse communities.
This configuration also limited the number of adjoining districts that had to
be touched. The district has a single incumbent and that is Senator James.
So, now before we talk about all of the other district changes, moving to those adjustments
around the majority-black districts, I'll explain those changes, there are a few things
to note about those remaining districts.
First, both plaintiffs' experts testified that they did not know a lot of details about
Georgia geography.
Our process was informed by Miss Wright's extensive knowledge of Georgia and my meetings
with senators about their areas.
We believe we've reached a plan that is far better than those produced by the plaintiffs
while also complying with everything the judge requires.
Second, it's important to note that the ripple effect is real when drawing plans.
When new districts are located in the southern part of Metro Atlanta, nearby population has
to be adjusted.
Those changes then ripple out, primarily north until they are resolved.
Third, the 15 change districts here are less than those proposed by the plaintiffs' experts.
So we were able to maintain district cores in a better way than their experts did.
Mr. Esselton changed 22 of the enacted senate districts and Mr. Cooper changed 35 of the enacted
senate districts on their proposed plans and we changed 15.
Fourth, we took into account the work on county election officials who have to update the
the voter registration database.
By drawing the map this way,
we are working to minimize the amount of work
required before the 2024 elections.
Fifth, the plan does not eliminate
any existing minority opportunity districts.
Judge Jones was very clear on page 510 of the order
that we cannot eliminate any existing minority
opportunity districts.
While he doesn't define that term,
it's clear that he's referring
to existing majority-black districts.
On page 511, he refers to whether
The plan provides black voters with additional opportunity districts.
There are also references to opportunity districts that clearly refer to black voters on pages
106, 145 to 146, 268, 417 to 20 and 427.
This senate plan does not eliminate any existing majority black districts and it takes two
existing majority white districts, that's district 17 and 28 and converts them to majority
black districts. Sixth is important to remember that we believe our 2021 Senate
plan complies with the Voting Rights Act and are pursuing an appeal of the
judge's order. That's why you will see language in this order that reversed the
2021 plan if the appeal is successful. This mirrors language used by
Democratic majority in 2002 when the state Senate plan was not pre-cleared in
time for use in that election. But if anyone is upset with how a district is
configured. Remember we did not draw these districts this way in 2021
originally and we did not want to redraw these districts now. We're doing this
because we were sued by democratically affiliated groups. Now I will walk
through the remaining changed districts. I'll start on the east and work my
way west so Senate District 25 stays largely the same with slight adjustments in
the Locust Grove area to accommodate the addition of District 17. This ensures that voters
in this district will largely maintain existing representation.
Senator Williams will remain the senator in this district.
Next is Senate District 42. Because of the ripple effects of moving districts north,
Senate District 42 was previously a majority-white district into cab county and is now a majority-white
district in eastern Metro Atlanta. It has much of the territory of the prior
district 17 which has become a majority black district. It includes areas with
strong connections like Newton, Morgan and Walton counties and growing areas
of Henry County. The boundaries include many rural areas and areas where people
are moving from Henry County into as they get older. This configuration also
ensures more of Newton County stays together. Senator Strickland will be the
only incumbent of this district. Next is Senate District 43. In order to make
room for District 17 District 43 moves north into Gwinnett County similar to
the configuration of the existing District 55. Otherwise this district is
largely unchanged with all of Rockdale Importions of Newton and Dakab and
all suburban areas. This district shares connections through I-20 and into
growing areas of Gwinnett County. Senator Anderson remains the incumbent for this district.
Next is Senate District 55. Senate District 55 also ripples north, taking in Tucker in some areas
that were previously in Senate District 41. It remains in both DeCab and Gwinnett counties and
includes areas along I-285 on the eastern portion of the city. Although Tucker is not whole,
it includes almost all of the city along with areas of stone crest. Senator Butler remains the
incumbent of this district. Next is Senate District 41. As part of the ripple effects around this
area, District 41 shifts to the west, taking in all of Clarkson and moving over north of Decatur.
This district previously ran from stone crest to Clarkson, so it includes a number of areas
that were previously in it. This configuration enables the district to stay
majority black while moving north because of the locating of district 17 to
the south. Senator Jackson remains the incumbent in this district. Senate
district 10 is directly affected by the creation of district 17 because it
previously ran through that part of South Henry County now included in
district 17. As a result the district shifts north to include areas around
Decatur. The district previously included stock bridge with portions of stone
crest and will continue to do so but with less of stock bridge included. The
district remains majority black even as it ships north. Senator Jones remains
the incumbent in this district. Senate District 44. Like District 10, District
44 has to give up population in the southern portion of the district to
to create district 17, so it moves north as well.
And so doing, it takes indicator,
ensuring that we included portions of Decatur
that were excluded in 2021
because the boundaries had not been updated.
The district includes all of Decatur
and most of the Avondella states,
areas that were previously in district 42
while keeping those communities whole.
The district remains majority black,
even as it ships north.
Senator Parent remains the incumbent in this district.
Senate District 39, moving over to the other side of Metro Atlanta, the next set of districts
are the changes necessary to add to other new majority-black districts in South
Metro Atlanta.
There are some blank spaces here because no changes were needed to Districts 36, 34,
and 16.
District 39 maintains its current north-south orientation, shifting to the west slightly
to accommodate the changes to our district 28 as the new majority black district.
The north south orientation has been consistent with how this district has existed for several
cycles of redistricting.
Senator Halpern remains the incumbent in this district.
Senate district 38 ships east and north to accommodate the addition of district 28 in
the south.
It exits Cobb County and now will be holy within Fulton County connecting areas from
from Palmetto and Union City,
which stay whole to areas of Buckhead.
There's a strong community in Fulton County
in the district maintains its majority-blikes status,
even as it shifts north.
Senator Tate remains the incumbent in this district.
Senate District 35.
This district shifts significantly to the north
to accommodate the new majority-blike district,
28 in South Metro Atlanta.
Instead of running south,
It now runs from South Fulton to the Smurna area
while maintaining its majority black status.
These areas are connected as growing suburbs
located primarily along the 285 corridor on the west side
and sharing a number of common interests as growing areas.
Senator Estevez is the incumbent of this district.
Senate District 33, in order to accommodate
the shifts of adding district 28,
District 33 shifts north and east,
taking in areas toward East Cobb.
The district maintains its primary East West orientation,
connecting powder springs with Marietta as it did previously.
The district is holy within Cobb County
and keeps powder springs whole.
Senator Rhett remains the incumbent in this district.
Senate District 6, in the process of creating District 28,
there was significant population left
where District 6 is now located.
This district keeps Kaueda and Hurd County's whole,
avoiding a split of Kaueda County.
In order to come out to the population needed,
it moves into the southern part of Carroll County
where district 28 previously connected Kaueda,
heard and parts of Carroll in the map,
prior to the 2021 districts.
District six connects the University of West Georgia
with New Nguyen, where there are a strong growing communities
and ensures that small areas in rural Carroll County which share a strong similarity with her county can remain in a district that is similar.
Senator Brass is the incumbent in this district.
Senate District 30, District 30 remains largely the same with the same boundaries in Harrelson and Paulting it previously had.
The district previously included a portion of Douglas County and now takes more of the western part of Douglas.
In an area that is very similar to Carol, including Villarica, which is a city that straddles the county line.
The district includes most of Carrollton and Carroll County
remains the largest county in the district. This district shifts east to help accommodate the creation of the new majority-white district 28.
Senator Dugan remains the incumbent in this district.
And that concludes my presentation of the map in the districts.
At this point, I'm going to open up the public comment.
And so we had a sign-up.
Who is not on the sign-up who would like to be added to the sign-up?
Well, that changes things a little bit, we will allow more people to sign up.
I want everyone's voice to be heard, but I will, because there are so many people who
would like to sign up now, I will limit your comments to five minutes.
If you would be respectful of that time limit, everyone should be able to get your point
across in five minutes, but I do want people's voice to be heard in this. So Lillian will
bring the sign-up sheet around. Who's the first name and we'll go ahead and get started.
We're going to get started with David Garcia and hold on one second and I will get your
Mic up.
You get to do it.
Hold on just one minute and we'll get started.
Here, take this one.
Take that.
After Mr. Garcia, we've got Dr. Jones.
If you want to be on deck, we'll get started with you as soon as his comments are concluded.
Five minutes.
All right, so we're going to set a timer.
You'll hear it go off at five minutes and I'll give you a couple of seconds to wrap it
up at that point.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you, Chairwoman and Committee for having us here.
I'm David Garcia.
I work for an advocacy organization named Galileo Impact Fund and we advocate for the Hispanic
community throughout Georgia.
I'm here today because the proposed Senate plan fails to adequately remedy the substantive
and procedural failings of the last maps.
One district is particularly concerning, Senate District 6, and the prior Senate District
6, voters of color, including Latinx voters, band together with some white voters to elect
Senator Jason Estevez, a Latinx candidate.
In the proposed map, even though Senate District 6 was not implicated in any way by Judge
as Jones's decision, the legislature cracked the district
increasing the white voting age population
from approximately 56% to approximately 72%
and ensuring that voters of color
can no longer elect candidates of choice.
The targeting of Senator Jason Estevez
is emblematic of the legislature,
targeting legislators of color,
a continuation of what the legislature did
to Michelle Owl and Lucy McBath
during the 2020 process.
Senator Estevez was a public school teacher
and was the first Latinx candidate elected
to the school board in Georgia.
He was only sworn in as a state senator
for Senate District 6 in January 2023,
less than a year ago,
and the legislature has already drawn him out of his district.
Additionally, the legislature did not seek adequate input
from the affected communities,
and provided the draft senate maps
only 48 hours before the opportunity to comment.
This is a continuation of practices
and lack of transparency that previously led the legislature
to enact legally deficient maps.
The Senate and House committees are apparently
also holding hearings at the same time,
further making it more difficult for Georgians to comment.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Dr. Jens.
Good afternoon.
My name is Dr. Yashanda Jones.
I'm a community advocate in the Gryffman-Spotten County area.
And today, I stand before you to address the need
for a fair redistricting, particularly
where I live in Senate District 16, which
was found to be a violation of the Voting Rights Act,
but remains unchanged.
We must confront the start reality
that black citizens, a vital and integral part of our community,
have often been marginalized in the political process.
Maps must reflect the true voices of the people.
Fair redistricting is not a political issue.
It's a matter of justice and representation.
The lines on the map should not be manipulated
to favor one party.
Rather, they should be drawn to ensure
that every citizen's vote carries equal weight.
In the pursuit of fair representation,
we must prioritize our communities over political calculations.
That begins with creating districts
that mirror the diverse makeup of the population in our state.
By doing so, we empower citizens to elect leaders
to genuinely understand and advocate for their needs.
It is our collective responsibility as citizens
to champion transparency in the redistricting process.
We are asking you to ensure that the lines drawn
on these maps are a reflection of the people's will
not the interest of a slight few.
We demand accountability and openness
in this crucial aspect of our Democratic foundation.
Fair representation is not a luxury.
It is a fundamental right.
Senate District 16 and others must be drawn with equity in mind
ensuring that black citizens have a meaningful voice
in shaping the future of our communities.
Denying any group fair representation
undermines the principles we hold dear.
Principles that advocate for justice and equal opportunity for all.
By drawing districts fairly, we bridge historical divides
that have silenced black voices for far too long.
It is an opportunity to rectify the imbalances of the past
empowering black citizens to elect representatives
who truly understand and champion their unique needs
concerns and aspirations.
To make any decision otherwise, or to create any maps
that you not have the goal of the parameters above,
would surely deem this body to be morally bankrupt
in the eyes of the citizens of Georgia.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Next row, I'm going to marry you.
I don't want to miss your name.
It's your honor to do it.
Yes, thank you, thank you for that.
No problem.
And then next we have Niles Franick.
Francis, thank you, thank you.
You'll be up on deck next.
OK, go ahead.
Good afternoon, Chair Nichols and members of the committee.
My name is Rahul Garabado.
I'm the senior voting rights staff attorney
at the ACLU of Georgia, and one of the lead counsel
in the case Alpha Phi Alpha versus Raffinsberger,
a case challenging state legislative districts
passed by this body in 2021 and one of the cases that is subject to the federal court's
order issued on October 26, 2023.
Before our case was filed in 2021, I along with my colleagues at the ACLU of Georgia testified
at every town hall across the state and during the 2021 legislative session advocating for
fair maps.
I'm here today to raise concerns with this committee about the chair's maps produced on
Monday, November 27th, 2023.
We put out a letter last night outlining these concerns that can be found at ACLUGeorgia.org.
But I want to talk to you all today about some of those concerns and urge this committee
to take a look at a proposed set of remedial maps that we put out last night as well that
can also be found at ACLUGA.org.
I want to talk about the issues that we have by framing what the order says, and there
are two really important aspects of the order issued by the Federal Court on October 26th.
The first one that you mentioned, Chair Nichols, is the number of additional Black Majority
districts that need to be in a redrawn plan.
have new Black Majority State House districts
and two additional Black Majority State Senate districts.
I think everyone understands that,
and this plan technically complies with that piece
of the puzzle.
But the second important aspect of the order
is about where the court found violations to be happening
in the state of Georgia.
For the State Senate maps, for example,
the court says that there is a 10 district area
where the current maps violate the Voting Rights Act.
That's Senate District 10, 16, 17, 25, 28, 30,
34, 35, 43, and 44, and those can be found
on page 514 of the order.
And that's the piece of the order
that the current Senate proposal ignores.
The vast majority of black voters who
are it newly placed in black majority districts
are from outside the 10 district area
that the court identified in its order.
Furthermore, there are specific districts
within the 10 district area that the court found unlawful
like Senate District 16 that remained virtually unchanged
and leave some of our clients
still in a district where they cannot
select candidates of choice.
Now, I mentioned that our letter also includes a proposed
remedial state senate and a state house plan.
And we urge this committee to take a look at those plans
because those plans adequately address both pieces
of the order that we're really concerned with.
They make sure that the vote delusion area that the court
identified is adequately remedied and it makes sure to make as few changes as possible
to other areas of the map that the courts order does not address.
Those maps can be found at ACLUGA.org and those include the technical files associated
with it to the block equivalency files.
We urge this committee to take a look at this so that we're not back in court after this
process and so that Georgians have fair maps.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Niles, Francis.
Good afternoon, my name is Niles Francis.
I am a resident of Mableton, which is now in Senate District 28.
I'm here to speak about the cinema that was unveiled on Monday.
Judge Jones instructed this committee to draw to a redraw 10 Senate districts.
Senator Eckles, you said that the map redraws 15. Most of those 15 districts were not redrawn in this map here.
And two of those districts that were ordered to be redrawn, Senate districts 16 and 34 were not even touched as part of this new map.
I would implore this committee to re-draw these maps in a way that complies with Judge
Jones's order because I know not a single member of this committee wants these maps back
in court.
So I would implore to re-draw these maps in a way that complies with the Judge's order.
And I would like to talk a little bit about Senate District 28, which I am now a resident
of, as of this new map.
Senator Eckles, you said that the two districts that were re-drawing to be majority black were
drawn in the vicinity of the, um, we're drawing the vicinity of the plaintiffs from
media maps. Um, Senate District 28 was not. Senate District 28, um, on the
the media map that was drafted by the plaintiffs includes parts of Fletzen and
Fayette County's and I believe parts of Clayton County as well and, um,
Cal Reda County. Um, the region and Senate District 28 that we're looking at
today includes parts of Cobb, Douglas and Fletzen Counties.
So I would just implore you out to reconsider these maps
and reach revenue in a way that complies
with Judge Jones' order.
Thank you.
Thank you.
OK, I think you want to what?
I don't have the next sign up.
She really is collecting it.
So do you think she went to here?
OK.
I'm waiting on the sign-up sheet.
Sorry.
All right, next up we have Ken Lawler.
Hello again, members of the committee. I think I know most of you. I'm Ken Lawler. I coach
your fair district's Georgia. We are a nonpartisan all volunteer organization. I think we're
kind of like the redistricting nerds in the room among many pro folks. I'm happy to be
back here justifying today. With me today we have several of our volunteer crew who came
down to attend both the House and the Senate hearing. So thank you again for the opportunity
speak to you. Our principles for looking at the maps really focus on what's the objective
of this session. The session in our view should be about two things. Number one is drawing
the new black majority districts as required by the court. That's number one. The second
thing we're looking for is we don't want to see districts changed aside from those necessary
to comply with the court order for partisan purposes. We don't want to see any partisan takebacks
given that you had to draw a new district
to allow black voters to have representation.
So we're scoring the maps based on those two criteria.
Do the maps comply with the court order?
And secondly, are there other changes being made
that appear to be for partisan purposes?
Now, we have developed score cards on these maps.
Those score cards are being delivered to your offices
this afternoon.
I don't believe we have delivered those
to the committee in here, but they're also on our website.
But you will have two score cards in your office
this afternoon, one for the map being considered today and one for the map that is being offered
potentially tomorrow by the Democratic Caucus.
You'll have both of those score cards available.
So let me just brief you on how we're looking at this.
So we're looking at a, we're scoring the maps on a two-part pass-fail test.
Number one, does it add the Black Majority Districts and number two does it have any other
partisan genius?
So, with respect to the Black Majority Districts, we do a simple analysis which it says count
the number of districts and other additional black and
dirty districts.
As Mr. Gravity mentioned, that the map does pass that test.
As Mr. Gravity mentioned, there are other considerations
in the judges order that are more technical in nature.
Our group does not look at those, but the plaintiffs, for
example, in the case will be assessing those for your benefit.
The one comment I'll make about a black opportunity or
black influence district is that UMAP has an issue with Senate
District 33.
Senate District 33 decreased black population
from 43% to 35%.
The reason that's important is that research
that we have available shows that 37% is like a magic number
when you have a community of voters of color
that exceed 37% in a given district.
That allows those voters to influence the vote.
They're not the majority, but that gives them the power
to strongly influence the vote in that district.
So in this case, the map has an issue of concern in our view
in that Senate District 33 has decreased
in its black population from 43% to 35%.
So that's a potential weakness.
However, given that the map does implement
the two black majority districts requested,
we give the map a pass on that part of the test.
It's okay.
When we look at the partisan side, however, we see issues, okay?
Clearly, the two new districts that were added
Senate District 17 and 33 are not new Democratic districts as one might expect
to construct them from primarily black voters.
However, we know that Senate District 1642 will basically uprooted and pushed elsewhere.
You say it's a result of a ripple effect.
We believe that ripple effect is an excess.
And as a result, you have flipped back two districts back to the Republican column
after making those changes.
We think that's inappropriate.
Again, this exercise should not be about
maintaining any powers and bounds from near the other.
The exercise should be implement the black majority
districts as requested and leave the rest of the map alone.
And so our objection to the map, and the reason
makes sure that the map fails, the parsing test,
is that you have basically repurposed six and 42
into Republican districts.
And we view that as a person take back
to try to even the score, which we think
is completely inappropriate at this point in time.
So we say that the map fails the test on the person basis,
but it passes the test from a Black majority perspective.
Again, our analysis on the Black majority
is very simple.
I mean, analysis does not take into account
the nuances that Mr. Gravity just mentioned
around how the district were constructed.
The other thing we mentioned is that this map changes
a lot of population and moves around 14%
population around we believe that's excessive and in fact of that 14% of the
population about a quarter of it is being moved strictly due to the
upgrading of districts 6 and 42 so again that to us indicates excessive
change and for partisan purposes which we believe should not happen we know
it's legal to do it we just think it's wrong and that's what that's what our
advocacy says here we will be prepared tomorrow to discuss the the if the
Democratic map is often we will also be prepared to discuss our issues with that.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Any questions?
I'm happy to take a good question.
Okay.
We're not asking.
Okay.
I think it's Carolyn Hargrave.
I apologize if I'm you don't you don't want to okay Julie Bowlin.
And then after Julie Bowlin is Jordan Madden.
Hey there, thank you.
Good afternoon, Madam Chairwoman and Committee members.
I'm Julie Bowlin, the redistricting chair
for the League of Women Voters of Georgia.
The league has been at the forefront
of the fight for democracy for over a hundred years.
We continue to ask that changes to the maps
limited to those required to address the remedy ordered by the court.
The committee should reject any and all attempts by members of either party to incorporate
other changes for partisan political purposes.
The maps offered by the Senate have failed both of these basic fair monitors as outlined
by the Fair District Georgia's report.
Secondly, we request that the committee chairs in both the House and Senate ensure that there's language access by translating public-facing materials
such as the comment portal into a minimum set of languages required to reach diverse Georgian citizens.
Georgians deserve a redistricting process that inspires trust and confidence from all Georgians. Thank you.
Thank you.
Next is Jordan Madden, and after Jordan will be Brian Ramirez.
Good afternoon.
I am Jordan Madden, a student member with the Georgia Justice Coalition.
Thank you guys for being here.
As a black voter in the state, I recognize the importance of voting.
However, I'm really relying on our elected officials to create district maps, and that
count my community fairly. Young Georgians deserve district maps that
accurately represent our communities and redistricting processes that inspire
trust and confidence as we begin to engage in the democratic process. So we're
here to tell our elected officials all of you guys in this room that representation
doesn't matter and democracy means we as the voters get to choose our legislators
not the other way around. More fair and accurate maps help us to reinvigorate
more young black and brown voters to get engaged and motivate them as they let their
voices be heard.
To you all here in this room, it is your job to prioritize fair and accurate maps so
that we can get this job done.
The future generation of black and brown voters in Georgia are counting on it.
We know that this fight is not over, unfortunately, but this is the beginning to a long battle
to ensure maps are equitable.
And we'll be right here fighting for those maps a long way.
Thank you.
is Brian here. After Brian is Zena Mohamed and if you want to come on up and
wait against the wall that way we can quickly get through it'll take less time
between thank you. Good afternoon committee my name is Brian I'm a student at
Georgia State University and a member of the Georgia Youth Justice Coalition.
Georgia State University consistently ranks first in degrees of
awarded to African Americans and over the last few years,
politicians have sent a message that black, brown,
and young people aren't worth the exact representation
promise to all.
Young Georgians deserve district maps
that accurately represent our communities
in a redistricting process that inspires trust
and confidence as we engage in the democratic process.
Right now, I'm a Fairburn resident,
district 38 on the proposed senate maps,
and might soon become an area that disproportionately
represents very different communities all the way
from Palmetto to Buckhead, both of which
completely different communities.
This just doesn't make any sense.
We need fair districts that can make sure
that every person feels represented by their elected officials
and that their priorities will get heard
instead of district representatives
that intently only focus on one demographic over the other.
Fair maps can do this.
Thank you.
Thank you.
On deck is Anna Dennis.
If you want to come up again to the wall, that's perfect.
Thank you.
Hello, my name is Zina, I'm a student at the University
of Georgia, and I'm also a member of the Georgia Justice
Coalition.
I just wanted to give a quick personal statement.
I voted for first time in 2020,
and I remember feeling so empowered
to do something that black activists
have fought for through generations.
However, today I feel very discouraged
about the actual power of my vote.
Over the last few years, I've seen unfair maps dilute
the strength of Black youth voters, like myself,
even after a federal judge ruled that Georgia's districts
were gerrymandered so aggressively
that he would not allow another election
without redistricting.
I'm still seeing that we're continuing
to make this process as difficult and inaccessible
as possible.
I think that this is a chance for Congress
to redeem themselves, but unfortunately,
we have yet to see that most student or young person
living in Georgia should feel discouraged from voting.
And if that's the case, and our democracy is jeopardized,
to confront the challenges Jordan's face,
we must have a government where all voices
are heard equally, where the public interests,
not special interests, guides decision-making,
and where we can put faith in our leaders.
But I do have a strong sense of Georgia pride,
and I am confident that our representatives
will do the right thing for states, thank you.
Thank you.
Next, we have Anna, and then on deck is Vivian Moore,
I apologize if I've mispronounced her name.
No worries, Gaffer Nguyen-Yah, Gaffer Nguyen Chair and Committee.
I'm Anna Dennis.
I'm the Executive Director of Common Cause, Georgia.
We are a pro-democracy organization that
has been challenging, redistricting across the country,
and particularly in the state for many decades.
But there are some things that we are definitely concerned about.
We are a part of see for coalitions and also see
through coalitions of the Georgia redistricting alliance.
We are concerned about the creation
of the two additional majority black districts
of Senate District 17 and Senate District 28.
It does not comply with the judges' order.
We would like for this committee
to actually follow the judges' order
and comply with the maps that need to be drawn.
With these maps, it reduces the number
of black influence districts from two to one
and Senate District 42 was, sorry, 51% white
And now it's 59% white.
And what's moved to the outskirts
of the Metro Atlanta area to basically rural Georgia.
CD6 had the similar fate.
This proposal does not do what it needs to do
and it does not create more representation for black voters.
I am a person who is a native of Georgia.
I am a native of the South Metro area,
born and raised.
Happy to say I am from Clayton County.
So this is definitely a concern for me
and definitely a concern of my family, my community members,
and all the folks who are definitely in this room
who are speaking up to say that they want
fair redistricting practices,
and they would like their voices to be heard.
And so we would like for you all to do that
by honoring what the judge has said to do in the order
by following the rules and not creating different processes.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Next we have Vivian Moore, and on deck is Mindy Sieger.
Thank you, I'm Vivian Moore, I'm with the Georgia NAACP and I'm here today just to let
you know our concerns and our recommendations.
One of the things that we're concerned about is not having enough time for public access
so that we can have our voices heard.
Another thing is that we want to make sure that the maps are drawn fairly.
the maps have just divided us as black folks we are divided now and what
will happen is we'd have less people going to the polls to vote precincts have
been moved things that we think that will hurt the black community is what we
want to make sure that we have a voice that we can actually let you all know
that we need to be a part of that when you start drawing your rejoin the
districts so a part of what we wanted to do is to make sure that we have fair
very fair maps. Number one, when you talk about fair, it's a fact that over the
years it's been discriminated. So when we talk about fairness, we need to talk
about all fairness. So when we talk about all people and the people that really
really need to get to these polls and precincts, when you redraw the maps,
consider all of that. Don't just consider that we'd risk redrawing the map to
make sure that it's what we think the court won't. Let's have a voice about
hearing the people and knowing what we need. I've been around in Georgia now
almost 40 years and I can tell you from my time that I've been here they used
to be something they call red lining. I call it no lining because we didn't
get what we needed when you start drawing the line. You not only took away
businesses, you took away precincts. Now we had drop boxes. Drop boxes went from
30 to 5. Things and those things are real concern and we want to make sure
that we have the timeline to give you our input.
So again, I'm Vivian Moore,
I'm with the Georgia NAACP,
and we represent 130 of us in terms of county.
So thank you so very much.
Thank you.
Next, we have Mindy Seeger and on deck is Hannah Joy.
Good afternoon, Chairwoman Committee.
My name is Mindy Seeger.
I'm a resident of Cobb County.
I also am the advocacy director for which it stands,
which is a nonpartisan organization
that employs people to have local control
and live local voices.
We are here because this body passed maps
that were graded in F in the case of the Senate maps
and found to be in violation by the court of Section 2
of the VRA.
I attended a couple of days of testimony as I was able,
and the overwhelming impression I got in court
was that the maps overall do not represent
The population growth changes in Georgia, of which all growth is due to any part black
populations and any decreases were attributed to non-Hispanic white populations that was
overwhelming every day in court.
We the people understand and ask for fair maps that reflect the trapestry of Georgia, competitive
or possible, and are compliant with the court in the VRA.
Let's talk a little bit about what that means.
means that this body, as a whole, should represent and reflect
be a mirror of its constituency.
The only way that's possible is if voters have an opportunity
to vote for their elected candidates of choice,
it has to be a reflection of the constituency.
Competitive, we talk about this a lot.
It breeds excellence.
It allows voters to feel like they have a real chance
of electing their candidates of choice.
Otherwise, why would they show up at all?
It helps confront partisan extremes
that plague our political process
on both ends of the political spectrum.
The court vary compliance.
We have to get this done because we don't want
to be back in court, you don't want to be back in court.
Voters want to know where their districts are,
who they will be voting for,
so they can start evaluating candidates.
Candidates can know where they're qualifying
and we can get on with the business of the election
that is coming upon us in 2024.
But I wanna talk about something we haven't talked about yet.
It is absolute fiscal irresponsibility
to enact the maps that you enacted
that you were warned with flawed,
cost us tens of thousands of dollars a day,
and legal defense, continuing legal defense,
and the session we're engaged in right now.
We want you to do right by the voters
and get it right this time so we can stay out of court
and we can have maps that we can rely on.
Many of the groups and advocates in this very room and across this state will take up
the mantle and responsibility of educating voters of these changes because that's what
we do.
This state has a robust surplus and I request that this body consider funding these impacted
counties board of elections to launch appropriate PSA campaigns to notify these voters of district
changes so they know where they are voting and who they are voting for.
That would be a good case of taxpayer funds, many in Georgia will support, but this continued
waste of dollars to keep us in court and to continue to have us in a special session
and keep rehashing the same things over and over again is a waste of time and a waste
of money that could easily be avoided.
So I am asking you on behalf of voters across Georgia to get it right this time.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Are you Hannah?
Yes.
Hannah, I have Ann Duncan.
Good afternoon chair and all committee members.
My name is Hannah Geber-Salassi, and I'm the executive director
of Protective Vote GA, which is a nonpartisan organization
that works to mobilize voters and protect voting rights
here in Georgia.
We focus on the Metro Atlanta area,
and I was also raised in Atlanta and the Metro area,
growing up in both the cab and Gwinnett counties.
And over the years, I've seen how much more diverse
these communities have become.
And right now, we have an opportunity
to meet these communities where they are,
because they're no longer what they were 30 years ago.
I'm here today standing in solidarity with Black voters matter
and many other of our colleagues from across the state
to further raise concerns that have been shared regarding the maps.
It has been made clear by a federal judge
who ruled that the current maps legally
dilute the power of Black voters, such as myself.
And that is unacceptable.
I along with many others today am concerned about the proposed maps
and that they will not increase representation
of black voters here in Georgia
as requested by the federal judge.
We urge you to draw the maps that represent equity
and fair representation of the diverse voices
in our Georgia community.
By doing so, we can ensure that maintaining public trust
and accountability is a priority.
I encourage you ought to lean on the expertise
of experts who have spoken here today,
such as Georgia Redistricting Alliance,
Fair Districts Georgia, ACLU of Georgia, Galeo,
Common cause, Georgia Youth Justice Coalition, League of Women Voters, and so many others that
are here represented.
We also echo the concerns of removing barriers to language access on the website as someone
who grew up in a first-generation household with parents whose first language was not English.
It's really important to make sure we are incorporating multi-lingual features on the
website to support people who do want to submit testimony or public comment.
Thank you for your time.
Thank you.
Ann Duncan and Isabel Philip is on deck please.
Good afternoon Madam Chairman and members of the committee.
My name is Ann Duncan I'm just an ordinary voter from North Fulton County that believes
in democracy and distracting is the foundation of democracy so that all of our voices
can be heard equally. And I am here today because I am really concerned about
equity for black and brown folks in our community. And I just want to know that
I can count on you on this committee to make sure that the maps that you
recommend are in compliance with what the judge has ordered you to do. We need
to focus the changes on the areas that the judge identified where black
voices need more representation. Thank you so very much. Thank you. Is Isabel?
After her, we'll have Senator James.
Hi, everyone.
My name is Isabelle Philip.
I'm a UGA student and a resident of Athens, Georgia.
Our city is full of young folks for whom the upcoming elections will be some of the
first they've taken part in.
Our city is also cracked to the point that many of us question whether votes have any
power at all.
As the agency noted in 2021, Athens is sliced into political pieces and as we move based
on the current maps, which specifically sought to diminish the power of black voters, that
isn't unique to Athens.
The legacy of racial, gender, and Georgia is something that we need to confront together.
I hope to see the proposed maps redrawn fairly now and I hope to see cities like Athens
drawn fairly in the future, because Georgians, especially young black Georgians, most affected,
deserve district maps that accurately represent our communities, and to be district in process
that inspires trust and confidence as we first begin to engage in the democratic process.
I love UGA, I love Athens, and I love Georgia, and I want to be here for a long time.
So I really hope to see my elected officials fight for myself, my classmates, and a fair
and just future for our state.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
After Senator James, I think Stephanie,
Ali, you'll be up after and you'll be the last.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Madam Chair, Senators, I've done Zola James.
of former right now in the 35th district,
but soon to be if this passes in the 28th district.
New district.
Well, Judge Jones ordered that the Senate
redraw the maps to remedy discrimination
against black voters in 10 specific districts.
And the courts specifically found that black voters
in these, those 10 districts,
did not have an equal opportunity
to elect candidates of their choice.
Instead of focusing on those 10 districts,
the Republican proposal makes the vast majority
of its changes in districts not identified
by the court order as not having enough minorities.
So instead of focusing on those districts,
the vast majority of its changes are in districts
that's not identified by the court order.
And then the districts identify by the court,
the Republican proposal changes district numbers
Instead, including mine, for no apparent reason, it appears to be a smoke and mirrors and
partisan gamemanship.
And I ask that this map be rejected and a map be adopted that complies with the Voting
Rights Act.
This act does not do that.
And maybe you can add a few specifics, I want to add some specifics about my district.
First of all, I got elected in 93 to feel the unexpired term of Arthur Langford.
And I still live in that same house that we had just built that year, my late husband
and I.
I wanted to do things to help my community.
So I was the end up being the second African-American female
in history to come into the state senate
in the 35th district.
And I was proud and honored to serve all those years.
And in 2002, I left the senate to allow other people
to run.
But in 2009, my community asked me to run again
because they never stopped calling on me.
They needed a person that would listen to them
and could strengthen the community of interests.
And that's what I have attempted to do all these years.
So in 2009, I ran again when the seat was vacated again
this time by Cassine Reed in the middle of the term.
I won overwhelmingly, and I've continued to do that because I trust the people that
people trust me, and I work with them, I go throughout my community, I go to all of
the events, and we work together, just like many of the other senators who are being
affected right now.
This morning, one of my colleagues got up for a personal point of privilege, and that's
the senator from the 44th who is also going to be changed out of her district to the 17th
which is supposed to be the other new district that people are saying is supposed to satisfy
the judges orders.
I disagree that it does that because I had a 79% black district yes and I knew it was
going to change because it was too packed. So I didn't mind that, but to be taken completely
out of the district and just my house, even some of the people who live on my street or
the next street are not in the new 28th. So I don't even recognize the old 35th district
from this map, and I cannot even understand why Senator, I know we're supposed to call
numbers, but I'm at 38th, how she could have Cobb County in the part that I have now,
if this new map passes, how her scenic could come all the way around and get my district,
And then I go all the way around the other way and get her district.
It's musical chairs.
What is it?
I don't understand.
So please, please take a look at rejecting this map or looking at the mere fact that it
does not satisfy the court orders.
Thank you.
And I appreciate it.
And I had a picture of the Vomit Rights Act being signed and I wanted to bring it up
here.
to be and I was going to show you why I ran for office in the first place. I
wouldn't have even been able to be the second African-American in history to be
in the Senate. Had it not been for that voting rights act and that's what we're
trying to comply with now. So I thank you for allowing me to speak and I hope
that you will look at this map. Thank you. Thank you. All right Stephanie
Well, thank you so much. If I had known I would have definitely wanted to go before the
Good Senator because that's a hard exit follow, but my name is Stephanie Ali. I am the policy
director at New Georgia Project Action Fund and while everyone's shared their Atlanta
Bonafidious, I will say that don't hold it against me, but I'm originally from Alabama,
which means, which means my people have been through this just recently. My folks are
from the new congressional district in South Alabama that took multiple cycles to make happen.
folks are in the new majority black district in South Alabama. And that is
because Alabama's, Alabama's, sorry legislative system were refused to follow
judges orders. And I told my mama over Thanksgiving I was like luckily we got
better leadership in Georgia. And now I'm sitting here thinking I'm gonna have to
call my mama back. Because this is not better than Alabama. It's more subtle. I'll
I'll say that, it's more subtle.
But changing number 28 up here to Senator James,
where Senator James currently sits over to Matt Brass
does not make a new black majority district.
It just changes the number of one that already was.
Taking district 17 from one place to another
does not create a new black district.
It just changes the number of one that was.
Nothing is new here for black voters.
They're just in new numbers, they've got to learn.
And a lot of new people are gonna have to learn a new rep,
a new senator, a new number, a new polling place.
So it's a lot of extra work for folks like us
who do voter education, for folks like Ms. Vivian
who do voter education, but it ain't gonna help build
black power, which is what the judge ordered.
But frankly, I know that just because I,
like I said, my folks just been through this.
The idea isn't complying with the judges order.
idea is running down the clock because we are coming up on the 2024 elections and voter
confusion only helps to break turnout and we don't deserve that. We deserve a better
class of leadership because I believe in Georgia. Like I said, I held it up to my family
and said, now we're going to do better. I can't wait for these maps. We're going to do better.
This is not a new black district. It's just under a new name. This is not a majority black
district that was created. This is a rebrand. This is a flipping of numbers. We
should be doing just as the folks who have come here saying, we should be
looking at Spalding at Fayette, at the rest of McDonough, where these places
really are, where black communities live and are underrepresented as they are.
so I thank you again for your time and I thank you again for your service. I know
we all want to get out of here but there's no reason to do this right now and
come back to the court and come back and draw it again because I really do
think we're better. Thank you. Thank you and that concludes the public comment
portion of our hearing today. We will be meeting tomorrow morning at 9am in this
same room. Tomorrow we'll be hearing the minority leaders plan and we'll be
taking action and so I invite you to come back then. Do I need a motion to
So moved second, all right, we all in favor of adjourning.
Thank you all for coming.
