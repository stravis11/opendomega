terror
recognizes chairman tanner for a motion
thank you mr speaker i move that this
house agree to the senate substitute to
house bill 511.
chairman tanner has moved that this
house agreed to the senate substitute
house bill 511
clerk will read the caption
house of 511 to be titled an act to
amend titles 32 36 45 48 and 50.
the official code of georgia annotated
relating to highways bridges and ferries
local governments
chair recognizes chairman tanner to
explain his motion
thank you mr speaker
um it was last year now it's kind of
hard to keep up with the date since it's
been an extended session but we had a
lot of conversations around house bill
511 dealing with transit in rural
georgia
but what you have before you today is
fairly straightforward and simple it's
been condensed down to really just
address a couple of things
one we created through house bill 930
the atl
a few years ago
and one of the things that the atl board
has requested is some cleanup language
around their voting procedures for
members for new members we've had issues
of whether or not they
where they wanted to meet for those
votes whether or not you could call in
or whether or not you could have a proxy
or whether or not you could do it over
the phone so this just cleans it up and
makes it simple across the board the
same at every meeting
it also says that the new board members
the election will be held during the
time the general assembly is in session
it will be held here at the capitol
because the majority of the members
voting for that are legislators so it
will be held during the regular session
of the general assembly here at the
capitol
if a vacancy occurs outside the general
assembly time then the chairman of that
will call the chairman of the atl will
call for the meeting and the meeting
will either be held here at the capitol
or will be held somewhere within the
district that the election is occurring
for so that's there it also makes it
clear that
in order to vote the voting will be done
by secret ballot
there'll be no proxies no
teleconferences no technology are
appointing another member to vote for
you so if you if you want to vote you've
got to be there in person to do that
again making it clear on the front end
fair and across the board
for everybody um
and then um it also one of the things
actually is really unnecessary at this
point because we've already voted on
this and another piece of legislation
but it's in this bill
uh at the very end
the last
section section 6. if you remember in
house bill 170 there was the indexing
that's done
right now that index is lower because of
the economy so it's actually lower than
than typical but this extends the
consumer pricing index out for fuel
motor vehicle fuel uh to 2025 it's set
to expire july 1st 2022 again we've
already voted on that and another bill
that's already passed out of this house
and out of the senate and is now over in
the
at the governor's office and that was
house bill 1098 i believe that's passed
this chamber already so be glad to
answer any questions again this used to
be a very complicated bill but it's come
down to really just cleaning up atl
language around the election process
with that mr speaker i'm happy to answer
questions
the chair recognizes chairman martin to
your left for a question
chairman ten are you yelling i do uh i
have a question i took me a minute to
find the bill and it's probably right
there in front of me but i'll ask for
brevity to be clear
isn't it true that i'm concerned about
the calling of the meetings when we're
out of session
we had
trying to deliver this in the form of a
question isn't it true we had an issue
with that happening this year where
there was a poll done
of where members could come and the
feeling was depending on who could come
on what day was where the members
uh where the meeting was called and then
then there was an issue around could you
vote electronically i understand is it
true that gentleman's take care of that
with the bill if you can't vote
electronically i just would ask
that there's notice given and the chair
will call the meeting and you will be
there it won't be a poll to see who can
come on what day
and then the meeting would be called so
could you articulate uh how that's done
a little bit or point me to that in the
bill thank you yeah i'll be glad to um
it's actually going to be done by the
chair if it's outside the time of the
general assembly meeting if it's a gen
if it's during the time a normal
election will take place during the
months we're here at the general
assembly that will always occur at the
capitol if there's a vacancy that occurs
then the chair of the actual atl not the
chair of one of the county commissions
but the chair of the atl who's appointed
by the governor so it'll be a
independent person will
call the election and that call of the
election will be done
either here at the capitol or at another
place within the district and there'll
be at least seven calendar days notice
given stating the time the place and the
purpose of the meeting so that would be
called by the atl chair uh either here
at the capitol or at another place
designated at the call of the chair and
at least seven days in advance and again
have to you have to be present to vote
and that uh just for quick reference
that would be lines 88 through 90 would
give you the uh we'll show you the
information around the call of the
meeting
mr speaker i'm happy to answer another
question if there is one i do not see
any mr speaker for that i would ask for
your favorable consideration to agree to
the senate substitute house bill 511
thank you on the gentleman's motion that
the house agreed to the senate
substitute to house bill 511 all those
in favor will vote i those opposed to
vote no and the clerk will
unlock the machines and call the roll

members will look at the board and make
sure it's accurate
and
the clerk will lock the machine
on the gentleman's motion at this house
agreed to the senate amendment to house
bill 780.
the eyes are 162 the nazir zero and this
house has agreed
chair recognizes representative reeves
for a motion
thank you mr speaker i move that the
house agree
to the senate substitution to house bill
846.
representative reeves has moved that
this house agree
to the senate substitute
to house bill 846.
clerk will read the caption
house bill 846 to be title next to amend
title 48 the official george annotator
relating to revenue and taxation
so as to provide that interest paid on
refunds of overpayment of taxes and past
due taxes shall be equal to the bank
prime loan rate
chair recognizes representative reeves
to explain his motion
thank you mr speaker i think this is
going to be my last time up here today i
hope so uh
but
house bill 846
this is a
a bill that has combined a few other
matters the uh the first part of this is
the annual irc
revenue code update and it has actually
been updated since we updated it earlier
this year in january it now includes
the cares act and the march 27 2020 date
that corresponds with that this is the
the thing we do every year that gets us
in compliance
with um with federal code and the um if
if this doesn't pass then
it actually has a fiscal impact of
approximately 154 million dollars to
georgia taxpayers so this compliance is
very important
second part of the bill um
is actually the underlying bill which is
representative corbett's bill about
direct pay permits which this body
passed um overwhelmingly already earlier
this session
and that just simply takes something
that's in dor rules and regulations and
moves it to code
the um the other two aspects of this
bill are some are two of the things that
we are obviously everybody in this room
is aware we're in new times and we're in
life in the covet era and the um our
state has been
trying very hard to do what we can to
work with with businesses and also
to make sure that we're prepared um for
future flare-ups which i think we all
realize that until there's a vaccine we
that's going to be part of our life and
what we deal with and this
bill is offering some great things
the first deals with ppe this bill
creates a a tax credit
for jobs that for for businesses that
produce ppe items obviously everybody in
this room hit some point
in march or april where you where you
were being contacted daily by folks in
your district needing
ppe and how to get it
if we what georgia needs to do is
establish that we produce and we create
and manufacture ppe here in georgia and
so this bill adds a very simple um 1 250
tax credit for a job that is directly
involved in the cr in the manufacturing
creation of ppe
the other thing that this bill does is
obviously everyone
everyone's district there's no immunity
here everybody's district across the
state
has many businesses that have suffered
greatly and there's been a program in
georgia for almost 20 years called the
job tax credits and the quality job tax
credit programs that establishes tiers
of um tax credits when jobs are created
in areas and the um the the more rural
and um
economically
challenging districts they are counties
they are the uh the more the benefit
that they are eligible for and it's a
sliding scale and so what this part of
the bill does is every business whatever
their 2019 number was which is based on
the number of employees there's a
corresponding tax credit
that's based on their whatever their
2019 tax credit was what the state is
going to do is we're going to go ahead
and allow
businesses that receive that to to
receive that same number in 2020 and
2021
and this is you know we've got to do
something and this is something that we
can do
to try to help our businesses as they
rebound from the the the coveted
devastation mr speaker with that i'll be
happy to take any questions
you have uh
questions chair recognizes chairman
knight to your right for a question
do you i do do you understand that cpas
and tax preparers across the state of
georgia are
quite nervous
and quite anxious to get this irc update
and i've definitely been made to
understand that i know that uh unusual
times in fact it's the first time little
trivia since 1955
that the
text deadline has not been on april 15th
or a day or two before depending on a
weekend or holiday so
indeed
uncertain times but as far as the
profession and making sure that the
georgia taxpayers and the preparers who
are helping them have certainty i
certainly want to thank you for the irc
update part of this and again i want to
make sure everyone knows that
that dollar figure that you just said
the 150 54 55 million dollars has been
included in the governor's revenue
estimate
and we need to get this out there asap
that's right july 15th is
right upon us
thank you for that and yes i know that
there are several cpas in the room
yourself representative wilkerson
representative carson and um i do
understand how important this is for
the cpa world
mr speaker i'll yield for another
question chair recognizes representative
carson
he waves chair recognizes representative
jasmine clark
to your ride up in the gallery for a
question thank you mr speaker does a
gentleman yield i do
um
just for my just for clarification does
this bill
create a new tax credit for ppe it does
that's correct
um does it have any further yield yes
do we have any idea the fiscal impact of
a new tax credit the the fiscal impact
of this it's since the proposal includes
hand sanitizer the fiscal impact is a
range of for
4.3
to i believe 13.1 million is the range
it's highly unlikely that we will see
the the higher end of that range and
it's simply because
the tax credit is only 1 250 per job so
um it is it's it it's more likely we'll
obviously know in time but it is more
likely that that will be towards the
lower end of that estimation
thank you
thank you mr speaker i will yield the
well let's get this important bill
passed everybody on the gentleman's
motion that the house agreed to the
senate substitute to house bill 846 all
those in favor
will vote i those opposed to vote no and
the clerk will unlock the machines and
call the roll

members will look at the board and make

clerk will lock the machines on the
gentleman's motion the eyes are 110 the
nays are 58 and this house is agreed to
the senate substitute to house bill
846.
chair recognizes representative gravely
for a motion
thank you mr speaker
ladies and gentlemen uh i am going to
move on house bill 1020 to disagree
i want to tell you why right fast
because we sent over a real good bill
and we
thank you thank you mr speaker
representative gravely has moved that
this house
disagreed to the senate substitute house
bill 1020 the clerk will read the
caption house bill 1020 being entitled
enough to amend chapter 5 of title 40
official quota georgia annotator
relating to driver's licenses so as to
provide for licensed suspension for
conviction of drug-related offenses
chair recognizes representative gravely
to explain
his motion
thank you ladies and gentlemen house
bill 1020 left this house they had
bipartisan support
we were simply asking for a risk
reduction program for those charged with
dui to hold them accountable for a
limited driving permit
the senate added two amendments which i
very much agreed with
one of the amendments was to allow for
drug related offenses to be eligible for
the limited driving permit also it added
for third-party testing
for drivers tests which would have
greatly helped us during the covet 19
pandemic and would have lightened the
burden to the state by allowing
third-party testers to give the driving
test however
they removed the als risk reduction
component to it so what happened was
they broadened the eligibility for a
limited driving permit by rem and then
also removed
the accountability component that we had
added so therefore we're going to move
to disagree
on the gentleman's motion at the house
disagree
to the senate substitute
to house bill 1020 is their objection

and this house has disagreed to the
senate substitute to house bill 1020

privilege
representative terry rogers
thank you mr speaker
wow um the other day i said it was my
last time in the well like tom mccall i
guess i was wrong
but
i stand before you today and mr speaker
with your introduction you paid me the
greatest compliment in the world when
you called me representative
terry rogers
you know i sit there and i look around
and we have mr speaker
we have mr leader we have mr whip
chairman
but the greatest compliment that any of
us carry is the title of representative
because it represents the people
and speaking of mr leader mr burns i
will tell you mr representative i will
tell you that i have teased you much
about
the only vote i ever really wish i had
back was voting for you
you know that's not true you've done a
phenomenal job and i appreciate you and
madame pro tem i don't mean to leave you
out in the title thing but seriously
representative is a great thing
you know as i park my car every morning
during session and i come across here i
walk across and i look up at the gold
dome and i look at lady freedom up there
and i think about what that means to the
people of the state of georgia but
especially what it means to me
and i say a little prayer and i ask god
for his wisdom and i ask him for um
you know guidance so that we can do the
right thing asking for protection
it is truly truly
one of the greatest things in the world
to represent the people of georgia and
it's something that i hope everyone
remembers
you know
almost 10 years ago
people of district 10 sent me down here
and i can i can remember being in this
well and being sworn in because it was a
special election
and i just thought wow this is this is
one of the greatest things in the world
but then i look back on that 10 years
and i think what have we accomplished
and wow what a right it has been for the
state of georgia and i want to recap
some of the things that we've done
together
for seven straight years georgia has
been the number one state in the nation
for business
we have um
created close to 900 000 new private
sector jobs
um we have
um
fully funded qbe
we have had one of the lowest
unemployment rates in the state's
history until lately and we all know
what happened there
something totally completely beyond our
control
we have taken a prison system and a
judicial system and turn it around and
become
the height of the nation um we have
we've just done some phenomenal things
for the people of georgia we pay past
tax cuts that have
benefited every georgian we've protected
the unborn we've strengthened second
amendment rights i know some people
disagree that's
that's my opinion
but we have truly all worked together to
do great things in our own way and i
thank you all for giving me the
opportunity to be a part of that
you know there's so many people to thank
as i stand here today
first and foremost i'd like to thank the
good lord for giving me the opportunity
to be here
as a as a kid growing up on military
bases across the world i saw the
sacrifices that were necessary to keep
this country great
i mean i experienced those and i thought
someday i'd like to be able to give back
and god has truly blessed me by giving
me that opportunity
i'd like to thank my wife and my kids
you know 10 years ago
like i said when i was sworn in um
they were here with me
and you know it's just been crazy things
have changed at that time my
daughter-in-law amy was pregnant with
our first grandchild we now have eight
and it's been a true blessing
have they suffered along the way yeah
there's no one in here whose family has
not borne the brunt of you being away
from them at times
so always be grateful for them
i have had the pleasure
and the honor
of serving as a floor leader
back to back some people think i'm crazy
for two great governors governor nathan
deal and governor brian kemp
i think that history will record that
nathan deal will go down as one of the
greatest governors in georgia history
and brian kemp is well on his way
towards making his own mark
i've also had the pleasure
of serving with great leadership
including this man behind me
speaker david ralston has been the glue
that has held this legislature in this
house together
he's done things
through
thick and thin to make certain that this
house is always the leader
cohesive we try to get along and he has
been a great
just a great leader
governor dill governor kemp speaker
ralston and others have all served as
mentors towards me but more importantly
they've served as my friend and i and i
thank them for that
you know it's um
to the rest of you to my colleagues all
of you
it's kind of a tough sort of situation
for me
because there's so many people in here
that i'm so very close to that i want to
name out
but i can't because if i do i'm going to
miss somebody and i don't want to do
that there is not a person in this room
whether we agree or disagree that i
don't have tremendous respect for and
love for we are truly a family
in this body
and we've been through some tough times
together
but there is nothing that can't be
accomplished if we um if we don't work
together
to my friends out in the hall
they've been great you know they have
they have been sources of information
they've been sources of friends
they're a valued asset to us we're all
part of a teamwork here together we're
part of a family to the staff
of this great legislature
i mean
now i say that i don't want to point at
one person in particular but i'm going
to break my own rule right now
thomas james
my administrative assistant
is absolutely phenomenal
i wish i could clone her
[Applause]
she um
for six years now
i tell you what she has always answered
the call you know sometimes state
employees get a bad rap not this one
right here
she's great
to the people of
the 10th district
they've blessed me they sent me down
here five times
and they're great people and i just
just a tremendous amount of gratitude
a lot of people have asked me what's
ahead
well the answer is i don't know
you know it's kind of crazy
i do know that i'm very excited about an
opportunity that governor kemp has given
me to chair the film music and digital
entertainment commission i look forward
to that i was talking with someone the
other day and said you know you're the
only person i know that doesn't have a
plan necessarily for leaving here
well that's probably true i'm the only
person i know that is leaving an
eighteen thousand dollar a year job to
take a job that pays nothing and voting
myself a pay cut on the way out
so you know there's there's a lot to be
said
about that so
but i am
but i am excited about about the future
ahead and i will tell you that i'll be
back and i'll be seeing you some around
as i leave um
i'd like to leave you with a little bit
of advice or a little bit of guidance
and i think it's something that we can
all benefit from
uh the speaker gave it to us when we
were doing the rural development council
and it's the first motto of the colony
of georgia it was put together by the
trustees
of um
the state along with general oglethorpe
and it's something that i think every
one of us could try to live up to
the motto is not for self
but for others if we keep that in mind i
think we're going to do okay
i'm going to leave you with a quote from
general douglas macarthur during his
farewell speech
he said old soldiers never die they just
sort of fade away
well i think the same can be said for
legislators it's time for this
legislator to fade away
and um
i'll leave you with that
god bless the united states of america
and this great state
thank you for everything
i'll see you around
mr speaker well
[Applause]
[Applause]

loophole that exists
in when property
taxpayers appeal their property tax
assessment
it closes a loophole where they're not
able to be awarded attorney's fees if
they appeal it up to superior court the
language that the senate added is at the
request
of the clerks and that is that if an
appeal takes place that if both parties
consent
that it can be done through video
conference
it would again only be if both parties
consent
to do that i would ask for your
favorable consideration i'll answer any
questions authority you do not appear to
have any questions on the gentleman's
motion
those in favor of the motion will vote i
those opposed to vote no

members will look at the board and make
sure that it's correct
representative ridley votes yes
any others
will lock the machines on the
gentleman's motion
that this house agree to the senate
amendment to the house substitute to
senate bill 410
the eyes are 160 the nays are zero
and this house has agreed
let me tell you the posture we're in
need everybody to hang with us just a
little longer
we got a couple of measures that we want
to take up and then we're going to try
to get you out of here
before too much longer
so
just kind of bear with us just a little
bit longer
i know it's been a long day but we've
gotten a lot of good work done
we're back on the rules calendar the
supplemental rules calendar
set by the rules committee at their last
meeting if you don't have a copy of the
bills they are on the tables i
understand
out back of the chamber in the gallery
in room 341
clerk will read the caption to senate
bill 359
senate bill 359 by senator huffstetler
the 52nd tillery the 19th strickland of
the 17th albertson 56 kirkpatrick the
32nd and others
being told an act to amend title 33 the
fiscal quota georgia annotator relating
to insurance so as to provide for
certain consumer protections against
surprise billing this bill has been
referred to the special committee on
quality health care that committee
recommends that this bill do pass
by committee substitute
chair recognizes
representative kelly the majority caucus
whip to present the bill
you mr speaker
colleagues i come before you today with
the
substitute to senate bill 359
and it's not hard to see what this bill
would do on line 17 we decided to name
this bill to georgia kova 19 pandemic
business safety act
we're here back to business and we need
to do everything we can to help get
georgia back to business as well
it's important that our state economy
get back on track and experience the
growth that we were going through before
this
horrible coven 19 pandemic hit
and this is this house's effort to do
that you'll do it in this way
it'll provide some certainty and
liability protections for businesses as
to what they can expect should
individuals want to come and visit their
place of business
that's for all businesses in the state
along with all homeowners association
condo associations as well these are
things that we have to do to get our
lives going again
we've worked diligently in this house
with the business community and we have
strong support across the spectrum of
the business committee
community
including uh the support of the metro
atlanta chamber of commerce every one of
our sports teams that takes place in our
state and that's important because
people need to be able to get back to
work and the way you get people back to
work is that the businesses have to feel
comfortable opening themselves back up
to work and so that's what this does now
i've heard some concern that this may
have an impact on on work
uh claims but if you'll look
on the bill
on line 157 it says nothing in this act
has any impact on workers compensation
claims that means that any right an
employee had previously an employee will
have today
speaker i know there's others that
may want to speak to the bill but i just
want to say this is important for us we
talk about being the best state in the
nation to do business and part of that
is getting through this covenanting
crisis and getting back to work
mr speaker
i know that the hour is late
but this is important work that still
has to be done and i know that we're
committed as a house to staying here and
working through this legislation
as as we continue to do throughout the
night so mr speaker i'll be glad to uh
take a few questions
chair recognizes
representative newton chairman newton
for a question
thank you mr speaker with the gentleman
yield
i will
isn't it true that this bill will bring
the needed jobs back the employment that
people need will make a significant
difference in instead of 10 unemployment
moving georgia back to the 4 we were
enjoying to where people were taking
care of their families their churches
their communities
you're absolutely right and what uh what
this will do is this will provide the
protections that businesses need to open
back up and to bring their employees
back to work and allow us all to get our
lives back to normal
further yield i will well there's also
for the healthcare community our
not-for-profit hospitals all of our
hospitals healthcare institutions
providers dentists want to give them
while while following clear standards
they will also be able to safely open
back up to serve both the employees that
work at these institutions but even more
importantly all the patients of georgia
that need these businesses open back up
it absolutely will and that's very
important i'm glad that we've been able
to work diligently with the healthcare
community on this and this will provide
much needed protections for them thank
you so much for getting georgians back
to work and thank you for the work you
did as an er doctor through this crisis
do you uh
yield for a question from the majority
leader of the house i was going to yield
but i'll take one more
thank you gentlemen yield i will
mr whip is it not true that the small
businesses businesses of this state
and or the backbone of this state
and the backbone of the the economy of
our country
and is it further not true that those
those companies those individuals that
operate those companies
or
the folks that drive employment
that keep georgians working
in a
small shops larger shops
and this legislation
will insure those folks
that they
have their proper
coverage
relationship
with their employees to protect them but
also ensure that they're able to come
back and do business in this state and
move us out of this pandemic this
situation where thank you for that
question mr leader and you're exactly
right as as someone who who
has spent a lot of time working to help
better our business community you
certainly know of what you speak and
this bill will provide much needed
legal protection for them to do that mr
speaker i know there's others that may
want to speak to the bill and
i
ask for this house as favorable
consideration we all need to unite
together so that we can get our economy
growing again i'll yield the well
gentleman has yielded the well
we do have others that wish to speak on
the bill and the chair
recognizes representative mclean to
speak on the bill
thank you mr speaker
and colleagues of the house i rise to
to ask you to vote no on this
piece of legislation you know
i heard my colleagues say that we um to
open us back up well we never close
i don't think we ever close the people
who who worked in the plants they didn't
close the people worked in the food
industry they didn't close the people
who worked in the hospitals they didn't
close they were they were still open
they opened they were open each and
every day
the postal worker he was he was
delivering your mail did anybody miss
any mail any day
not one day did you miss any mail so it
was you never close
you talk about a pandemic we are in the
pandemic and we came back march 16th
i'll never forget march 16th longest
longest it's it's a long day
mark 16 we came back i got a text at
five o'clock that morning from an admin
my admin
uh in the city she says i've been
admitted to the hospital
and
they diagnosed me with pneumonia
that was that was on that monday morning
on that thursday well i texted back and
said i'll pray for you that because you
know i mean that's the right thing to do
on that thursday i get a text from her
husband and
he says she's been diagnosed with colon
or corona it was coronavirus then it was
a coronavirus
on the 19th on that on that thursday
well
and i said wow i mean we didn't know
very much
but on that sunday she passed
she was my ad man for 22 years in the
city of atlanta and i never had a chance
to say bye
and then her husband that didn't have a
chance to say bye to her as well because
he was quarantined for 14 days
on yesterday there were 1750 cases in
the state of georgia
1750 cases
in the state of georgia today there were
new cases i'm sorry new cases i need to
straighten this up
1900 new cases today
today
so what i'm saying to you is we need to
vote we need to vote no reason we need
to vote no for because these people the
people that that i serve in labor the
people that i serve for so many years
the employees the workers
there's no protection for them
because usually if they're working
people there's no separation
when when if playing vogel there's no
difference in the electrical worker
going to work and somebody just walking
through looking at it
no one in this building that no one in
this room
works in the chicken pen it's for the
food and commercial workers now one
person in here
there are new cases each and every day
and we've got to do better it's
impossible do you know how hard it would
be
to have a workers claim a workers comp
claim and
about covet
you it would be almost impossible you
know why would be impossible
because they don't know if you call
covert a year ago five months ago or if
you if
if kobe was there the day before
we this is not a good bill
this bill is not good at all it's not
good for people that that you employ
now it might be good for an employer
it might be good for a workers comp
attorney
but it is not good for the employee
it is not good for a worker
you know in gwinnett county i'll never
forget i was keeping the data two weeks
ago we were number five we were number
five with counties today we're number
one and we ain't looking back we're not
looking back
we're already we're already a thousand
more than fulton county in that count in
this county fulton county the county of
julian we've got to realize we've got to
say to people that we we talk to each
and every day that we care about them we
always talk about we came here to
represent those that that that are
voiceless
well i'm saying to you that the people
that we need to thought to protect are
the people that are working because they
didn't close
the warehouse workers didn't close
the you went and shopped and ate every
day you didn't close
your postal worker you didn't close
so what i'm saying to you all is is that
we've got to we've got to make a
decision
or are we going to think about saying
that
that we're going to reopen
it's not a such thing as a reopen
it's we have to improve but first
there are three things i think we must
do
we we must find a vaccine
we must find a cure
we must find treatment
i still have no idea no one is
mentioning me what we did with those
1900 people
no one has said that you know
do we send them home and quarantine them
for for 14 days do we tell them to go
home and drink three gallons of water
or do we go home and tell them to
to take our aspirin
i have no idea what we do with the
workers these folks that are being
tested new cases each and every day what
kind of treatment they're having i have
no idea what are we doing for contact
you know tracing i have no idea either
but all i know is is that we just can't
keep kicking this can down the road and
359 will not do anything
for workers
not anything for the people you're
supposed to be caring about
i uh
i think i i shared the one story with
you all about
the the worker but i i've attended five
funerals
five funerals cover 19.
and the worst one that i attended was a
friend of mine a former pro football
player
and at that time it was early
and the only thing it was ten people you
they're only allowed ten
10
10 in the service 10.
i'm one of the 10.
the pastor's one of the 10. so therefore
now you at eight
and you're in a 300 you're in a 300 seat
facility and the wife is sitting on the
front row here the sister is sitting two
rows back and i am in there with it with
a mask on and gloves which was mandatory
which i kind of like
at least you can take your mask off when
you come here to speak and you can hear
a little bit better but have you ever
looked out at 10 people in a 300
thinking a 300c capacity and all you see
is a mask and gloves
and you trying to say something
about about their loved one
people we've got to do we are better
than that we are better than that
and i'm asking my colleague one more
time
i'm going to ask you i mean i'm asking
you passionately we need to vote no on
359. we need to send a message that
sure we're the number one place to do
business but we're also the number one
place for people to work and take care
of their families
with that mr speaker i leave the well
chair recognizes representative al
williams to speak to the bill
before i knew that was a lot of talking
now
thank you mr speaker
i've heard my colleague ultimately speak
about the workers
and and he was certainly on time but i'm
not here i'm from another direction
while i've always supported workers
45 years of my working career has been
either owning a business or working in
business consulting that's all i've ever
worked with so i love business i have a
problem with business
and
i love being in place for seven straight
years has been the best place to do
business but i want us to go seven
straight years
as the best place to live and raise a
family too
what i'm concerned about more so than
anything is kind of under the radar and
i ask this in rules and i was answered
what about
the people in nursing homes
who won't have a legal recourse
because of this legislation
there was a time in the conversation
changed in this country
when when especially democrats
and a lot of times republicans
talked about poor people
only people get talked about now are
working people in the middle class
a lot of poor people are in nursing
homes
poor people
and and and we've we've looked like
we've forgotten them
disproportionately they have died doing
this pandemic
i understand many people have died but
the problem with this legislation is
what about those that suffered before
the pandemic when nursing homes are
written up time and time and time again
for post service
for terrible service
not talking about since the pandemic
alone
you can go down the list and look at
nursing homes written up time and time
again people who can't speak for
themselves and can't do anything laying
up there at the mercy of corporations
who can afford lobbyists and they're
just sitting there usually on medicaid
and dying like flies doing this pandemic
i have two and one in my district one
right outside of my district the one
right outside of my district is an
excellent facility one in my district is
not so excellent
closed down an entire wing because mole
was falling through the ceiling
water on the floor having to come in and
vacuum up water time and time again
these folk couldn't speak for themselves
one thing about nursing homes
the first year
all the birthdays all the special days
christmas visitors
second year
mr birthdays just come for christmas and
special days third year
hardly nothing after that and people
stay in these facilities sometimes eight
and ten and twelve years nobody comes to
see about them and only people can talk
for them are those of us
that have the opportunity to speak for
them
you're telling me that it's good
business to let people die because you
didn't keep your facility up now you
can't even sue them for it
all these years of decrepitness
terrible facilities
substandard food don't even cut the
grass and they get paid the same thing
by everybody
and the only people losing are families
without a voice and people who don't
even have families
oh yes i love to do business and i'm
glad we're doing business but what about
the least of ours
we're gonna be judged by what we did for
those who can't speak for themselves
no it's not the legislation protects
those who don't deserve protection
because they were lousy at business
before the pandemic and they will be
lousy afterwards we pass this kind of
legislation with that mr speaker i leave
the well
chair recognizes the minority leader of
the house leader trammell to speak to
the bill
thank you mr speaker and the gentleman
from the 100th district and the
gentleman from liberty county
have articulated
very
well developed critiques of this bill
and i'm going to be very brief
but i just want to call your attention
to line 10 of the bill
the findings of the general assembly in
line specifically it is for health care
institutions facilities and workers
that require additional flexibility and
then lines 13 through 15 of the bill
the finding that certain protections
that were provided during the gov
in the governor's executive orders
should continue
beyond the public health state of
emergency
and that's for health care institutions
facilities and workers
but you know this bill has an
interesting name in section two
the georgia coveted 19 pandemic business
safety act
let me tell you something
businesses don't get coveted
people get coveted
this bill doesn't seek to protect people
from coveted
it seeks to protect businesses against
people
if we want to talk about safety
what we should be talking about is ways
to make workers
safe
ways to make georgians safe
that's the missing piece of this bill
we're not talking about providing
protective equipment
in the bill
for people front line workers who had to
go in
when i had the luxury to be able to sit
in my house and shelter in place
other frontline workers had to go to
work
this bill does nothing
for them
and so we spent the resume legislative
session
and this is what we decide
is
what we need to do about covid
you know if i had to say one thing about
this bill
it would be
that it surely demonstrates the
seriousness
of covet 19.
if we're in a position that we think we
need to provide immunity
because covet 19 is such a terrible
event
then you know what else we need to be
doing as a body
we need to be legislating about public
health measures that would keep people
safe
and we're not doing it
so mr speaker i'm going to oppose this
bill
because we should be talking about
keeping georgians safe
businesses will be fine
and the final point
when we talk about a resumed economy
you know the economy is not going to get
better because we provide immunity
protections for business
the economy is going to get better
when people feel safe
when they feel like they can go to work
and interact again without risk of
contracting coven
and that's not going to happen
just because we provide immunity that
doesn't change the situation whatsoever
mr speaker i'll yield for questions if
there are any if not i'll yield well
do you yield for questions i do
chair recognizes representative bruce to
your right for a question
thank you
i yield
is it
true to say that
passage of this bill
and given the rights that we're talking
about to these companies in effect takes
that right away from
general citizens and people who are
apt to be heard by all this
is that safe to say
i think that's a that's a fair
characterization
and you know the
i think that's a fair characterization
okay
one more time i will
would this not be
better handled by just people that home
business is taking out an insurance
policy
to cover whatever
damages they have
i think insurance is certainly an option
they look the truth is that
you know the the the type of
there's a there's a cynical
core at this bill
and the cynical core is you know we
don't we don't
immunize provide immunity to businesses
for the flu
or other diseases
you know the reality is there are this
this could have been narrowly tailored
the way the findings suggest to provide
uh protection for healthcare
institutions who were in the front lines
and treating patients who were coming in
but instead this is an effort to to glom
on it's like a a free-for-all for
immunity you mentioned the word immunity
and everybody wants in on it
one last thing about you
are you
by giving
this to the businesses who are we not in
fact incenting them to be lackadaisical
as they go forward with this you know if
you have no consequence for the actions
you take
how conscientious are you going to be
about those actions if there's no
consequence to them
well i think i think the gentleman has a
point i wouldn't say necessarily that
they're incentivized to do that but i
think there is a risk of a moral hazard
and that moral hazard is
that if you have immunity and it doesn't
matter
what you're doing then you're less
likely to take the types of steps that
would keep people as safe
and the final thing i would say uh
before i yield the well mr speaker is
you know when i was at home in the
middle of this covet crisis i didn't get
any emails
from local businesses saying hey the
most pressing thing that we need to do
to combat covid
is to provide immunity for businesses
but you know what i got a lot of emails
from workers who were concerned about
the lack of safety protection in their
places of employment and they were
asking what could they do
and the sad answer that i had to give
back to them is
not much
you can call dph if they're not
following the the guidelines in the
executive orders but with this
the answer will be tell them you're out
of luck mr speaker i yield the well
gentleman has yielded the well
is there any objection to the previous
question being ordered
the chair here's none the previous
question is ordered is there any
objection to adopting the committee
substitute
the chair here's none the committee
substitute is adopted
is there any objection to agreeing to
the report of the committee which was
favorable to the passage of the bill
the chair here's none the report of the
committee is agreed to
shall this bill now pass all those in
favor of the passage of the bill will
vote i those opposed to vote no and the
clerk will unlock the machines and call
the roll

weeks
two weeks turned into three months
and much happened in that three-month
period
i wound up with a new partner on the
other side of the building to work with
and chairman blake tillery i want to
tell you
tonight has done an outstanding job
stepping into some very large shoes that
he has to feel
melody debussy and her team at the
senate budget and evaluation office have
done an incredible job as well
our folks the ones i'm so proud of the
house budget research office have been
incredible
martha and christine and all the team
across the street over there
have spent hours and hours and hours
literally
pouring over information trying to
understand how federal funds were being
used or could be used and how they can
be used in different areas
they have truly done an outstanding job
kelly fahr and his team at opb
they have done an incredible job as well
we have truly had a partnership as we
have gone through these last three
months trying to figure out
where the ship of state would land
as we came back into session to adopt a
budget
my administrative assistant ashley
newton down in
245
she has answered thousands of phone
calls as most of your admins have as
well
from unemployment issues to anything
under the sun that you can imagine
but i need to say a special thank you
someone tonight that i haven't had a
whole lot of time with for the last many
weeks my wife cindy
when i've been there i haven't really
been there
because we've been on zoom calls we've
been on emails we've been on conference
calls the first one thing in another
and i've been just a little more than
distracted while i've been home so thank
you to her
so as we were here in september
we were having discussions about the
governor's idea
to reduce the state's budget by six
percent
we came back in with that plan in mind
as we left here and adopted a budget on
on march the 10th and then as we left
here on the 13th to come back on the
16th for a day
we felt good about the budget we had
passed we've given our hard-working
state employees and our school teachers
a very well deserved raise
then covet 19 hit
something like none of us living today
with exception of maybe chairman don
hogan who was here during the 1918
spanish flu
nothing like this have we ever seen in
our lifetimes
we we lived through the great recession
we saw what it did to our state's
economy to our nation's economy to the
world's economy
but it was spread over a period of three
or four or five years
what we've seen happen to us now
happened in one quarter
i hope it is a v
instead of a u
or trough
and i have much optimism to think that
it's going to be a v georgia continues
to outperform the nation
in our retail sales and credit card
transactions
matter of fact we are doing about twice
as well as the rest of the nation
but we're still
short
it's still required that our governor
do the prudent thing in coming back and
lowering the revenue estimate
from what he had originally established
when we were here in march
it was necessary it was prudent
thankfully through the time
of the last seven or eight or nine years
of recovery from the great recession
we have had the ability to restore and
build upon our rainy day fund here in
the state of georgia
we've done so to the point of about 2.8
billion dollars
as the breaks were applied in march
april and may
i for one was very thankful
that we were able to do that
some things i want to tell you about in
this budget
while it's a 10 percent reduction
basically across the entire budget
many agencies are not reduced to the
level of 10 percent
some agencies were able to help a little
more than others so you'll see some that
are a little over 10 percent
but as a whole throughout the budget
it's basically a ten percent reduction
it was necessary when two billion
dollars
or almost two and a half billion dollars
disappear
out of the revenue stream almost
overnight
within the budget and the revenue
estimate that the governor gave us as a
revised revenue estimate on monday
he is recognizing funds from the rsr of
about 250 million dollars
why not more you may ask
well
statute requires that four percent of
prior year revenues remain in the rainy
day fund
in the rsr
it also requires that one percent be set
aside as well
for the mid-term k-12 adjustment
so that's five percent of prior year
revenues that have to be left in the rsr
and cannot be touched cannot be
appropriated
they can be touched under the trigger
that revenue once we get into the new
fiscal year
they can be touched at that point to
pull those funds down if the governor
deems it necessary
understand that to finish out fy20
it will take us somewhere over 1 billion
dollars out of the rsr to close out the
books
that's why we're only moving 250 million
at this time
i want to thank our members of the
appropriations committee
both republican and democrat
we've heard from many of you
we've taken many suggestions we've taken
many
points
or concerns that you have had as we've
gone through this process
and i want to tell you that the budget
you have on the on your desk in front of
you today is much different than the
best the budget that left the desk of
the senate last friday
with the governor lowering the projected
cut from eleven percent to two to ten
percent
it has made some significant changes
within this document
first off
i know many of you had concerns about
pre-k and hope
pre-k and hope remain left alone
thankfully our lottery sales have
remained incredibly strong
and we still have the only lottery in
the united states of america that has
continued to grow during its entire
lifetime
education still receives
53.2 percent of the total state funds
that are allocated in this budget
while there is a reduction in qbe
of 10
or about 950 million dollars one thing i
want you to understand and note
that there were also
457 million dollars in federal funds
that were distributed by the georgia
department of education to our school
systems in the state
to help offset some of the reductions
that they i'm assuming they knew that we
were going to have to make and they were
distributed on the title one formula
so when you look at it that way
it winds up being about a four to four
and a half percent cut
to the funds going to education
because those school systems can use
those federal funds to replace
revenue also hear me and when i say that
k-12 enrollment growth is fully funded
training and experience the steps for
our teachers are fully funded in this
budget equalization that is vitally
important to our rural school systems is
fully funded in this budget
sparsity grants are fully funded in this
budget
the senate as they were having to work
toward an 11 percent
found it necessary and i don't disagree
with them because they were trying to
find dollars anywhere they could find
them
they had made a reduction in student or
pupil transportation we have been able
to fully restore that transportation
fund back to where it was
in previous years
governor's office of student achievement
many of you have
expressed your concern about the
governor's honors program and several
other things that were being done there
at ghosa
we have basically sort of restructured
it
many years now we've been putting
different things at gosa and taking a
few things away and putting things back
and first one thing in another
but we have reallocated funds within
gosa 1.7 million for the master teacher
leadership academy 1.6 million for
governor's honors 1.5 million for
growing readers and 1.8 million for the
georgia awards program
those are there and funded
higher education both our university
system and the technical college system
of georgia
they do see cuts as well
but understand they also receive
significant federal funding
to offset what they knew would be some
difficulties that they would be facing
but understand as well
their methods of teaching may very well
be different come this fall
moving toward a virtual model
as well as k-12 systems may have to do
as well
i want to mention one other thing on the
k-12 systems before i move on
as we came through the great recession
and we made necessary cuts back at that
time
our school superintendents our school
boards our administrators within the
school systems
realized at that point that they were
caught short
in many ways and knew that they could do
better
when funding revenue from the state or
from the federal government took a dip
they know we have to live under a
balanced budget just as they do
our school systems have done an
outstanding job
in the intervening eight or nine years
in building local reserves
our local systems are setting on about
3.3 billion dollars in reserves on the
local level more than the state of
georgia itself has in the bank right now
i'm not complaining i'm bragging on them
i'm proud of them for the job they have
done to prepare
for the next dip in the
economy the department of labor i know
i've i've had
tons of conversations with many of you
as it relates to the department of labor
and trying to to get the onslaught of
people that they've been trying to help
and trying to to to give assistance to
for the last two weeks i've been staying
downtown in a hotel that's directly
across the street from the department of
labor building i want to brag on those
folks for just a second
i'm an early
riser and as i've been getting up in the
mornings and getting dressed i've been
looking out the window
and what startled me last monday morning
a week ago was to see
department of labor employees
leaving the parking lot walking to the
building at 5 45 in the morning
we would finish here late i would get
back to the hotel 8 39 o'clock sometimes
a little bit later to look across in
that building still see office lights on
and people in there working
those folks have done an outstanding job
one that we know very well many of us
know very well that i talked to on a
fairly regular basis
i was talking to her the other day about
a certain claim and she shared with me
that she had 24
300 emails in her inbox
of folks she was trying to help
keeping that in mind there are no
reductions to the department of labor
the conferees also felt that because of
the pandemic it was necessary and
prudent
to help the department of public health
as well the county grant and aid money
has been put back into the budget
that goes directly to our counties and
the county health departments
in this budget as well
funds six months of postpartum care for
mothers on medicaid
19.7 million dollars
there is also eight million dollars in
new investments for behavioral health
core services that increase the capacity
across this state for those individuals
needing help
2.5 million dollars in new funds are
directed to open 95 crisis beds in the
state as well
we know that dbhd is going to face an
issue
as we come out of this pandemic
and we felt that it was necessary to
make sure that they were equipped to
handle that
also there's enough money in there today
now to go back to the house position of
100 now and comp waivers
for those with disabilities across this
state
addiction services another thing that
dbhd has to deal with
we've heard from many of you talking
about the addiction recovery centers and
the and and stressing a little bit about
those potentially having to close
the 3.6 million dollar proposed
reduction there
has been wiped out and they have been
restored
many many things within this budget to
be proud of many many things in this
budget to vote yes on
as the governor gave us his revised
revenue estimate he included in it
something that he felt was necessary and
we certainly agreed to
and that was 15 million additional
dollars to the criminal justice
coordinating council
to help further law enforcement training
in understanding how to de-escalate
events
if you'll remember in fy 17 we also
started a program at gypstic the georgia
public safety training center down at
forsyth georgia
2.1 million dollars since then has been
spent
to add a class on de-escalation
and those since 2017 on have received
that as their base schooling
and as those post-certified officers go
back for additional training they also
get that schooling as well
criminal justice also requires
a sound and timely processing of
evidence
so as you look at gbi
you'll see
that those individuals that we need to
process rape kits and other evidence
that funding has been restored as well
the proposed original reductions to the
accountability courts
have been restored
to funding as well too
you know personal services is
government's largest
expense when faced with reductions of
historical magnitude the budget options
had to contemplate reductions in force
and in furloughs
however house bill 793
hear me well
house bill 793
does not contemplate any furloughs
let me say it again
house bill 793 does not contemplate any
furloughs
many were proposed
and truly honestly the difference of one
percent from 11 to 10 percent we were
able to eliminate
any and all furloughs within this budget
we've consistently asked our state
workforce to do more
with less
especially
during the great recession and the time
after it and technology has certainly
helped and i think we're going to see a
lot of changes in state government and
business in general
because we figured out teleworking works
pretty well
in talking with director tom rawlings
big facts
he has been amazed
that the case work that their folks have
been able to do that normally came into
an office from eight to five every day
has actually increased as they have been
working from home
because less distractions more more time
to focus on what they're doing
to our state employees who were stressed
about the
the potential
tripped on that one the potential for
furloughs
we're sorry that you had to go through
that stress we understand that
any of us that have worked for an
employer understand when downsizing or
furloughs or whatever are are being
talked about is very stressful
but we're very thankful
for the job that you do on a daily basis
from our law enforcement individuals
to our admins here to the folks at
department of labor dot department of ag
wherever corrections juvenile justice
i've started down a list i'm afraid
somebody will get mad because i stopped
but our time is limited
but thank you to those individuals
that keep us safe
keep us healthy
and keep us educated
ladies and gentlemen i typically walk
through the tracking sheet
i brought a case of water just in case
you want to
but there are
2035 lines that show up as differences
within the house version of this budget
i don't figure you want to stay here and
listen to me talk that long
mr speaker
i'm glad to answer a few questions
this budget has been on everyone's desk
for a little over 24 hours now
i think we've had time to look at it i
think we i know we've had time to ask
questions because our office has been
fielding questions i saw melody with the
with the senate budget office a few
minutes ago she said she had been
answering some of your questions from
house members
i hope we have answered your questions i
hope you understand what you have in
front of you
it's tough to cut 10 percent
there's nothing easy about cutting 10
percent out of a budget
but i truly believe that what you have
on your desk in front of you is
something that you can go home and be
proud of and i see
senator lucas
and i want to mention one last thing
before i take questions
senator lucas and i have chaired or
co-chaired the the
governor's rural hospital stabilization
commission for quite a few years now
it's kind of our passion something we
share and have a lot in common and is
our joint passion there
and one of the things that i'm very
proud of in this budget as well is we
were able to go in and put some
additional funding in to help our rural
hospitals
we know that putting the brakes on
elective surgeries impacted our rural
hospitals dramatically
right now they're in pretty good shape
because they don't do the collections
for those billings until another month
or so
we know that there will be a crisis at
that point
and i feel like that we're set in a way
to help those hospitals at that point in
time
mr speaker i'll answer a question or two
and then i'll get out of the way because
i know about the next thing is maybe the
governor and us going home
chair recognizes uh chairman beverly to
your left for a question
this habit
those gentlemen you yes sir
uh is it not true that i have a
tremendous amount of respect for you i
think that you are a fantastic
legislator i said this is not true that
i have a tremendous amount of respect
for you that you are a fantastic
legislator thank you great great
chairman and that your staff is above
approach
uh is it further not true and here's the
heart of the question that this budget
does not contemplate
cutting corporate loopholes around that
could generate
approximately 500 million dollars
where we wouldn't have to
uh actually cut anything
that we could leverage
it's not true
that this budget does not contemplate
the question is is true that this budget
did not
confidently cut in corporate
tax credits across the board
well thank you for that question and and
no it does not and here's why
even if we did a rollback on those today
the impact would still be next year
would still be at the earliest six
months whether it be
looking at at tax credits that we use
and have used to make georgia the number
one state in the country to do business
in
and take it another step further looking
at tobacco funds i know there's been a
lot of a lot of discussion about tobacco
taxes here
even if that had been contemplated in it
we would not be able or even if that had
passed we would not be able to recognize
it until at least january of next year
understand we have a a guard rail
to work within and that guard rail to
work within is what the governor says is
the revenue estimate
had he included that
in there
and that bill stalled or failed or
stopped or whatever and didn't make it
across the finish line to make it to his
desk and he had included five 200
million is the number i've seen on
tobacco had he included that in his
revenue estimate
and we got back here in january it would
make our job in the amended budget much
much worse because what happens at that
point
if you've come up short because some of
those things didn't pass
then at that point contracts have been
issued for k-12 school systems they've
been issued at regents and
technical college system for instruction
you've taken effectively 53.2 percent of
the budget off the table to be able to
work within to be able to balance the
rest of the budget
leaving roughly 46 47 of the remainder
which are dbhdd dph dch djjdoc
public safety all those different
entities
that then
if we had looked at say a five percent
cut instead of a ten percent cut today
coming back then and knowing that those
things those measures didn't pass that
money was gone it was never there to
begin with
then
those reductions to those other agencies
i just mentioned
would probably be somewhere between ten
or twelve percent above the five percent
that we would have theoretically based
it on
so i would tell you
you know that's a that's a whole other
discussion outside of the budget but i
would tell you that
the revenue estimate we have in front of
us is a prudent revenue estimate in the
way that it was calculated and what were
the things that were anticipated in it
should some of some of that had moved
then we would have been in a better
shape come january potentially
but again i've seen wildly varying
numbers just on the tobacco tax number
itself i've heard anything from 50 to
500 million so you never know
i hope that answers your question
generally for one other question yes sir
was there any consideration around doing
a revenue anticipatory note or attack
into supporting pretoria note to cover
the shortfall because we're in a
pandemic
that we could easily leverage debt in
this particular space to cover the cost
of the cuts
and then come back with a date certain
that are repayable so if we did a
revenue anticipatory note that the date
certainly a year from now we could
invariably have the revenue to
the only way that the state government
can do that
is that it has to be taken and repaid
within the same fiscal year
and to make what i think you're thinking
about work you would not be able to do
it within the same fiscal year
because if revenues never rebounded we
would not have that ability to repay it
and we would be in a we would sure
enough be in a bad spot at that point
yes sir mr speaker i'll take one more
question i think everybody has a very
good idea of how they're going to vote
and i i don't want to cut folks short
but at the same time we've had
a little over 24 hours to talk about it
and i certainly hope that we've been
able to answer as many questions as
possible in that time so one more
question
well you have six lined up but if you're
only going to take one more i'd
recognize one member of
representing one member of the
democratic caucus
we'll go to the republican caucus and
recognize
chairman hawkins to your right for a
question
does the general on yield yes sir
i've said to you over many years thank
you for what you do privately i want to
say it publicly tonight
you've built two budgets this year
and god knows what we may face in the
future
this is covent 19 we may have a cold
dude 20 and 21
and i want to tell you i feel very
comfortable having a man like you
helping us do this thank you sir thank
you thank you mr speaker since that was
an undeserved compliment
i'll take a couple more questions
if he had said it about staff if he said
it about our staff then it would have
been deserved but he said it about me so
it wasn't deserved
chair recognizes uh representative
oliver to your left for a question
does the gentleman kneel yes ma'am i
also want to thank you for your work and
particularly for you indulging me time
and time again on many issues
but is it true sir that the frustration
of having to do a
billion dollar cut
makes us reflect on how things are just
not changing quickly enough
and i direct your attention
to the bond package from one page 167 to
169
where we're purchasing for five million
dollars of bonds
for 500 new cars
you agree with me i think that our work
patterns are changing
you agree with me that the rental units
over at the twin towers has helped
why is it that we continue to buy cars
four and 500 cars a year in a budget
crisis
well i think because just like myself
things wear out
vehicles certainly wear out and what we
have what we what you and i have
inherited and all of us have inherited
is a fairly large fleet that we have
managed to trim over the last 10 years
fairly significantly but it's still a
pretty large fleet
even with the work patterns changing
there is still the need for many of our
people whether it be in juvenile justice
community supervision corrections
pardons and paroles department of ag
department of labor i can go on
but there's still a need for them to be
in person from place to place
and
in talking with commissioner black i'll
use as an example
the fleet he inherited several years ago
they were spending more on repair and
replacement of parts on those vehicles
than what the vehicle was actually worth
but they didn't have replacements for
them
so i share your concern you and i have
talked
i would say ad nauseam but i don't get
sick from it but it's been a lot
about this particular issue
and
we've still got some work to do i i will
tell you that i feel like we've still
got some work to do but i do know that i
don't want
one of our state employees stranded on
the side of the road because they're
still having to drive a vehicle with 175
or 180 000 miles on it that breaks down
and strands them there but we will get
there thank you mr speaker one more
question i mean it this time chair
recognizes representative gertler
in the gallery to your left for a
question
the gentleman yielded yes sir
is it not true
that we've asked these departments like
our law enforcement
our education department to make cuts
yet conveniently we have still fully
funded the one georgia authority
which is not the proper role of
government to interfere in free markets
is it not true that that's really a slap
in the face
to the taxpayers and the economy in
georgia
when we have a budget crisis
we're funding
subsidies that are not conservative
not the proper role government
is that not true you and i have had
several discussions on this particular
point over your term here and i would
continue to say
that the job of the one georgia
authority
riva grants other things are things that
bring jobs to the state of georgia if
you wish not to bring jobs
to this
state then
if you're ever in my shoes you can do
what you wish to but i happen to be a
very strong believer
in the work that one georgia does for
our economy
for our rural areas around the state
and those that are probably going to be
hurt are hit the worst
of any communities in the state are the
rural parts of this state during this
pandemic
and i think it's an investment in our
future
and i continue to think that
mr speaker with that
i yield the well
and i commend to you the conference
committee report on house bill 793
and ask for your favorable consideration
and thank you for your time
what purpose does
representative mccloud rise
parliamentary incorporate your inquiry
is it not true that taxpayers right now
are paying over 127
million dollars to private run prisons
i do not know the number representative
if you've researched it and that's your
belief i'm sure that you believe it to
be true
another parliamentary state your inquiry
isn't it true if this amount is correct
that we could use this into our public
school system and reduce the
school-to-prison pipeline
well i'm sure the lady believes that to
be true
yes the lady does
what purpose does uh chairman welch
arise
state your inquiry mr speaker is it not
true that with this budget despite the
10 cuts
that again the house has
put its stamp on leadership in terms of
accountability courts juvenile justice
incentive grants
uh doing exactly what the lady was
speaking about redirecting individuals
giving them a second chance
and a better life instead of
incarceration
so that georgians would have a so that
we would fulfill our pledge to have
criminal justice reform and lead the
nation in criminal justice reforms is it
not true that we are maintaining that
posture with this budget despite ten
percent
by by continuing fully funding the
accountability courts
there will be a lot of empty beds in
prisons in georgia
all right um that completes the
parliamentary inquiries on the adoption
of the conference committee report on
house bill 793
all those in favor of the adoption of
the conference committee report will
vote i
those opposed will vote no and the clerk
will unlock the machine and call the
roll

members will look at the board
and be sure it is accurate
clerk will lock the machine on the
gentleman's motion
that this house agree to the
senate amendment to the house substitute
to senate resolution 844.
the eyes are
162 the nays are zero
this house has agreed
chair recognizes chairman hitchens for a
motion
not a story
a motion
i make a motion that
the house agreed to the senate amendment
to house bill 819
chairman hitchens has moved that this
house agreed to the senate amendment to
house bill 819 the clerk will
read the caption house bill 819 to be
entitled enough to amend article 2
chapter 5 of title 40 the fifth dakota
georgia annotator relating issuance
expiration and renewal of licenses
chair recognizes chairman hitchens to
explain his motion thank you very much
mr speaker ladies and gentlemen of the
house
you probably remember about three months
ago i brought house bill 819 here and
it's a special bill to me it's all about
honor and integrity and remembrance
uh
representative park bought this bill to
me it wasn't my bill but because
he knew that i was a marine vietnam
veteran he thought it was best that i
handle it
it's a bipartisan bill that two
republicans signed on here and four
democrats
uh senator ed harbison who's also a
marine vietnam veteran carried this bill
over in the senate but what it provides
for is that
a naturalized citizen of the united
states who's also a citizen of georgia
who served in the military of another
country who was allied with the united
states would be entitled to receive a
veterans license
in in specificity
there are about 50 koreans that live up
in
gwinnett county that fit this criteria
and
i've been able to go up there and meet
with them and uh
made a lot of new friends and
other great people
and this is a matter of honor to them
and and they really seek this
uh it went through every committee
without opposition and i was shocked
yesterday when i went over and and they
voted on it in the senate chamber an
amendment was attached to it
and i really don't have much
problem with the amendment personally
but i was shocked when i found out later
that it passed both houses three years
ago when it was vetoed by the governor
now there's a different governor now but
this is a simple amendment
what it does is it prohibits law
enforcement officers from taking
possession of vehicles that don't have
license plates on them or who haven't
haven't paid their yearly tax on their
vehicle
and i have no issue with that
i certainly
will answer any questions if there are
no questions i'll yield away i do not
see a single question
from here to
pooler oh wait a minute you do have one
too i'm sorry
who is that
no they waved they waved
okay
on the gentleman's motion at the house
agree
to the senate amendment to house bill
819 all those in favor will vote i
those opposed to vote no and the clerk
will unlock the machines and call the
roll

members will look at the board
clerk will lock the machines
on the motion
the eyes are 160 the nature's zero
this house has agreed to the senate
amendment to house bill 819.
chair recognizes
representative mondahan hand for a
motion
thank you mr speaker i move that this
house agreed to the senate substitute
for house bill 463
representative mom dehan has moved that
this house
agreed to the senate substitute to house
bill 463
clerk will read the caption
house bill 463 to be entitled an act to
amend title 40 the fish dakota georgia
annotator relating motor vehicles and
traffic so as to provide for the
issuance of a class c driver's license
to operators of certain three-wheeled
motor vehicles
chair recognizes representative mom
dehan to present his motion
thank you mr speaker members of the
house i'll be short as the hours late
this bill does three things and the
changes are as such it creates a
reciprocal driver's license that is
sanctioned by the georgia department of
economic development allow some
flexibility in mailing notices to
citizens of our state
and allows a pilot program for
electronic drivers licenses with that mr
speaker
i will yield for questions
you have a question if you care to yield
idea
chair recognizes leader tremble to your
left for a question will the gentleman
yield
i will isn't it true in section 1-3 of
this bill that it eliminates
the certified mailing requirement when
your driver's license has been suspended
i believe the system believes i believe
the representative believes that to be
true
will the gentleman further yield
i will and isn't it true that if you
eliminate the certified mail requirement
that you'll have people who do not know
that their license has been suspended
who could be taken to jail because there
is not proof that they receive that
notice from the department of driver
services for being honest for driving on
a suspended license even though they
don't know they're doing that
if rapson believes that be true
yeah
we're good
mr speaker if that's all the questions
out we deal with well gentleman has
yielded the well
on the gentleman's motion that this
house agreed to the senate substitute
house bill 463 all those in favor will
vote i those opposed to vote no
and the clerk will unlock the machines
what purpose does represent our chairman
watson rise
state your inquiry mr speaker is it not
true that this bill allows department of
driver services the option to use
certified mail or certificate of mailing
and that over half of the certified mail
that they currently send out is returned
to the state at a cost of over half a
million dollars and is wasted and thrown
in the trash because no one receives it
if the gentleman so states he sounds
like he's done a little research into it
thank you mr speaker
all right we're voting the clerk will
call the roll or unlock the machines and

but
before he comes in
i got a little housekeeping note
and i mean
housekeeping literally
as all of you know
this session has been different
from most in many many ways
and fittingly it will end tonight in a
different way
in an attempt to keep any additional
personnel out of the building
due to covet 19 concerns
we do not have the small army of
custodians
coming through the chamber this evening
so
i want you to listen to me very
carefully
please do not
tear up any papers in preparation for
adjournment
i know that's a time-honored tradition
and a lot of fun
but
there's not going to be anyone here to
clean it up and when the time does come
to adjourn
please do not throw any papers in the
air
again there will be no one to pick them
up
also please clean out your desk as you
exit tonight
so i want to repeat that
i'm going to give you the real easy
version don't tear papers up
don't throw them upon adjournment
and clean your desk out as you leave
this evening and i thank you for your
cooperation and assistance in keeping
the people's house clean
mr doorkeeper
mr speaker

governor we used to try to finish
session before easter
i promise you we're going to be home for
the fourth of july this year okay
i want to
just say a word or two about governor
kemp a longtime friend
you know i told him one time over the
course of this pandemic
you know have you gone out and bought a
book on how to cope with this and how to
get through it because this has been
such an unprecedented time
and this state has been tested as as the
nation
in the world
but i appreciate
his leadership and his management of
this state
through an unprecedented and very very
difficult time
and
i know i speak for
all georgians when i say that
so
i appreciate your leadership during the
session in the final two weeks of the
session
and it's my pleasure now to introduce to
you
the honorable brian kemp the governor of
the state of georgia
[Applause]
thank you all thank you speaker
[Applause]
thank you all very much thank you
thank you
thank you all
i know
i know this house and
those folks on the other side of the
hall continue to work and i will be
brief tonight but i did want to just
take opportunity to come by and i want
to thank the speaker and the
leadership of this house on both sides
of the aisle and the members for
allowing me to do this
it's an honor to be with you i know that
you all
in this situation that we have been in
have been working at breakneck pace in
the days
behind us and today as well
i want to let you know that marty and i
and our three girls want to thank you
speaker ralston and this
georgia house of representatives for
your thoughts and prayers during this
unprecedented time they have certainly
been felt by myself as well as my family
i also want to thank those in the body
that will be leaving us
for your service to our state as a
former member of the legislature
i remember being a young freshman and
having people like
chairman tom mccall
helping me learn the ropes as i served
in the local delegation with him
certainly people like one of my floor
leaders representative terry rogers and
many others
that i had the opportunity to visit with
yesterday thank you for your service
but i want to thank all of you for your
service and dedication to our state
in these unprecedented and challenging
times
and i want to especially thank
you all
for your support
of the public health state of emergency
an unprecedented act
that was taken earlier this year
in the fight against covid 19.
at this critical juncture in our state's
history
i am regularly reminded speaker of a
quote from sir thomas carlisle
sick voss non-vobas thus we labor
but not for ourselves
with your help
this declaration has resulted in an
unprecedented level of state local
federal
private sector
and other coordination to combat covid19
to help strengthen our healthcare
infrastructure
purchase life-saving equipment
and protect the lives
and livelihoods of our fellow georgians
and as you know this virus is still
deadly and it is still affecting
georgians every day i want to continue
to urge and ask you to help me do that
all georgians to heed the guidelines
issued by public health officials and do
their part
to stop the spread of coronavirus
as you know we have made tremendous
progress in our efforts
thanks to the many that have been on the
front lines those heroes of today
our law enforcement
our health care workers
truck drivers
grocery store clerks
the national guard that i'm pretty safe
to say has been in every single state
house district
across our state
the state patrol
the georgia emergency management agency
and the departments of public health and
community health
their long hours
and selfless service
have been inspirational to me
and i know they have been to you as well
on january 16th of this year i address
the people of our state in this very
chamber
in 2019 we accomplished so much together
record investments in education
innovation and health care and a renewed
commitment to the safety of our citizens
that day i outlined my vision for 2020
having established a strong foundation
for our state
we would continue to build on that
success
unemployment was at record lows job
growth was strong
and our businesses were thriving
no one could have predicted that we
would face a worldwide pandemic
and grapple with the life
loss of life of so many americans
in just a short few months
and with this uncertainty
as a nation
we also witness with our own eyes
the injustice
in the deaths of ahmad aubry and george
floyd
communities continue to grieve and look
for a path forward
one that unites us instead of dividing
us
these unprecedented challenges hit all
of us very hard
our families and our constituents
and as state leaders we must continue to
stand strong for the people of our state
making tough decisions and doing what is
right
and i am thankful that together at the
end of this legislative session
we have managed to do some truly
remarkable work
in our great state
we passed a conservative budget that
reflects our values prioritize education
health care and public safety while
confronting
the challenges
in the realities that we have before us
i cannot thank chairman england and
chairman tillery enough for their
leadership
in working alongside my team
and the many others that chairman
england i thought did a wonderful job
thanking earlier today
to get this budget done
despite these difficult times and
against all odds we are moving our state
forward
for the people of georgia and i have no
doubt
that if we keep building together we
will emerge stronger than ever before
thank you all for your service
good luck the rest of the evening
be safe on your travels back home and to
your district
let us know if we can be of service and
god bless you all thank you speaker
thank you
luke
[Applause]

the
challenge of following the governor

373 which is
a very simple cleanup bill

assembly joined 40 other states to
establish gross negligence as the
standard of care by which a court can
hold officers and directors
of georgia for-profit corporations and
banks and trust liable

and it was an oversight that nonprofits
were not included in this legislation so
this bill attempts to just clean that up

request your favorable consideration and

question being ordered the chair hears

and um
i don't mind

yeah
let's uh let's recognize those who won't
be back
he wants to recognize augusta university
first of all the
majority leader had and he mentioned
this to me earlier today
[Music]
leader burns had a parliamentary inquiry
mr speaker
state your inquiry
mr speaker is it not true that you
tasked a committee
that you allowed the minority leader
tremble and and myself to to chair that
committee earlier this year to
help um develop a protocol
and then you took that protocol our
suggestions and and developed
the protocol for this house to keep
everyone safe here
and
and we certainly appreciate your wisdom
in that but part of that protocol has
been inside this building manning the uh
the doctor of the day for the time we've
been here and also an fqhc from middle
georgia that chairman hatchet provided
for us has had a unit outside that has
provided
to our medical needs and also provided
the covered 19 testing and covered
19 excuse me covert 19 antibody testing
and code with 19 pcr testing mr speaker
is it not true they've done over 240 pcr
tests and over 400
antibody tests on members and staff
probably now over 800 as of this day
the speaker want to thank augusta
university
all the folks the physicians there
medical association of georgia but
especially i won't call all their names
the the minority leader and i are going
to send out a list of the physicians
that were here but especially dr brooks
kill
and then dr russell king who helped work
all of this out they've done yogan's
work and i hope everyone here has taken
advantage of that service to us and just
want to give a shout out them and thank
them for being here and taking care of
our medical needs during this session
all of that is true let's give them a
hand
and
and and let me let me also
say
that um
at some point after we got into the
pandemic we realized that
you know we need to start looking at
some alternative plans when we came back
and
um
i wanted both parties to be at the table
and i appointed a
bipartisan committee that was co-chaired
by the majority leader and by the
minority leader and i know
they had some intensive meetings and
over
many weeks and came up with some
great recommendations that i think have
made us all safer
and made this
session flow
incredibly smooth i think under all the
circumstances so please give all the
members of that committee a good round
of applause thank you
[Applause]

owe a tribute to for your service
