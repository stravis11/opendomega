Well good morning.
It seemed like too many mornings this session I've had to bring to our attention members
of our family that are going through problems and the same is certainly true this morning.
When we go to prayer this morning, I'm going to ask you to remember Chairman Ron Stevens.
We just got word, I knew that he had put his father in hospice over the weekend, less
than a month after he lost his mother, and we just got word that he's on his way to
to visit with him. He literally has very, very little time.
Chairman Bonnie Rich is still in the hospital, but we're hopeful that she will be discharged
today.
Mandy Balinger. What a fighter. She is in the hospital. She had surgery Thursday and is
having another round of surgery today. I talked with her late yesterday afternoon and her
spirits are good. She already has a timetable laid out for when she gets out of the hospital
and comes back to work, but she's got some challenges, but we are happy to have Chairman
Lynn Smith back this morning, Lynn, it's good to have you back.
We will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain after which we
will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 104th House District
Chairman Chuck Eftration, Chairman Eftration.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen of the House.
It's an honor today to introduce to you Pastor Mark Ikin of the Hamilton Mill campus of
12 Stone Church.
Pastor Ikin has been in local church ministry for over 30 years.
For the past 17 years, he served as campus pastor at 12 Stone Church.
12 Stone is a church of eight campuses that reaches over 25,000 people in Greater Gwyneth
County.
This has been, he has been married to his wife Tina for 26 years, Tina has spent her life
as an educator and is currently teaching in the Gwinnett County public school system.
Tina is here with us today. Would you please rise so that we can thank you for being here?
Mark and Tina have three children. Their oldest Carly is a recent graduate from Georgia State
University and is a Gwinnett County public school teacher.
Kyla is a current sophomore at Georgia Gwinnett College, and Marcus is a freshman at the University
of North Georgia.
It's a great honor to have Pastor Ikin here with us today, Pastor.
Well, good morning, Mr. Speaker, Representative Eftration, thank you for the invitation to
be here today. You know, you stand in a room like this and you get a sense of awe of
the history and the work that's been accomplished here. I know for many of you, this is just
an ordinary day at the office, but for a regular citizen like me, it's certainly an honor.
And I know it's not only a big day for me, but I understand for many of you that it's
a pretty big day too. It's qualifying day. And some of you have announced that you're
not qualify and that you're going to end your time of service.
In others of you have probably already refreshed the qualifying website three times in the
moments that I've been up here trying to find out who's running against you.
But I know that in addition to the agenda that is before you, they're in the pressure
and the excitement of qualifying day, there's much that occupies your mind and your heart.
I also know that this is month three of session and for some of you, this is a little bit
like being deployed. You come from districts, maybe where you're unable to travel home
often and you're away from your family. And that occupies real estate and your mind
and in your heart. I remember a number of years ago I was traveling to Sri Lanka. It was
shortly after this tsunami had caused massive destruction and our church had been sending
teams to help rebuild the communities. And I'd be gone for about 10 days, which is not
very long considering what you guys might be going through, but it was long enough to make
me a little bit melancholy about being away from my wife and children.
And I remember sitting in the plane on the tarmac looking out the window and it was a rainy
day and that just kind of added to the mood.
But I remember praying a simple prayer, God would you watch over my family while I'm gone.
Seems like a good thing to pray and I'm sure that some of you have said that prayer
while you're here.
And I felt like God responded with a gentle but clear voice of truth.
And he said, Mark, like, I'm not the one who watches over your family when you are home.
I said, you're right, God, thank you.
The same God who watches over my family when I'm home is the God who watches over my family
when I'm away.
You see, no matter what part of the state you come from, no matter what party you represent,
We all have a life that's outside of this chamber.
We have spouses, families, parents, children, relationships, business responsibilities,
and many of these things weigh heavy on you while you're here doing the work of serving.
I was asking a friend who's also qualifying today, I said, how can I best serve in my time
here today?
He said, Mark, they're just regular people dealing with real issues like everyone else.
Mr. Speaker, you mentioned a few of those this morning.
So maybe the best thing that I can do is pray for you.
The truth is some of you have loved ones
that are dealing with health issues.
Maybe a cancer diagnosis and you're here and they're there,
but your heart is with them.
Some of you are missing ball games
or missing recitals or important events
in your kids' lives.
Some of you have missed out on the birth of a child
while you're here.
Some of you are facing financial pressures outside of this room
are overwhelming. Some of you are struggling in relationships or marriage and you can't solve
those while you're here. Some of you are trying to solve complex problems from a distance. And I
think how I can serve you, how can I serve the people who serve us, and probably the best thing
that I can do is point you to the one who can. There's a scripture that I've been sitting in for a
a while, it's from the book of Psalms, Psalm 33 says this,
no king is saved by the size of his army,
no warrior escapes by his great strength,
a horse is a vain hope for deliverance,
and despite all its strength, it cannot save.
But the eyes of the Lord are on those who fear him,
on those who put their hope in his unfailing love.
And just like I realized that I'm not the one
who is all powerful, God is all powerful.
It's not my strength, my wisdom, my resources,
my army, but Scripture says,
God is with those who fear Him, who put Him first.
And when you do that, He steps in,
and that's a much better place
than having it all rely on you.
So I want to pray for you.
I want to pray that you would seek God's protection
more than your own.
I want to pray that you would discern God's purposes
more than your own,
and I want you to know that God's power
is greater than your own.
So I'm gonna ask if you would rise and pray with me.
God our Father in heaven.
Thank you for our nation,
for this great state of Georgia which we get to serve.
We humble ourselves before you
because we're capable of being proud towards you.
Sometimes our success blinds us.
And sometimes we think it's all on us
when really you're the one that's in charge.
So God forgive us, for you give grace to the humble
but you oppose the proud.
We all stand in need of your favor in our lives.
And I pray over our families and our loved ones.
And right now each of us has in mind
God, those we love,
would your presence be with them?
Would you protect and provide for them?
Well, we are here the same as you do when we are home.
For those who are dealing with illnesses,
I pray that you would provide healing.
God, the struggles we face in life are not unseen to you.
And as we gather this day,
We ask that you would do miracles.
We pray for those who have little ones at home
who are missing their mom or dad.
And I pray that they would know how much
their earthly parents love them and long to be with them.
I pray for those who are dealing with financial pressures.
God that you would be their provider.
And I pray for each person in this chamber
as they do the work of the state.
God, we seek your favor in 2020.
I'm grateful for a state government
that's committed to making difficult decisions head on
and seeking your will.
And, Father, you know the issues that are before us, the full agenda that needs to be accomplished,
the complexities of finances and people and parties, God would you grant us breakthroughs
in unity to accomplish greater things for our state, both in our metro and rural areas.
God give us wisdom to lead state business, courage to walk with character and endurance
to keep your word.
And may your favor rest upon this house and those who serve on behalf of the citizens
of Georgia and Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which
stands one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
Doorkeepers will unlock the doors.

You
members of the house will please take your seats all members will take your seats.
We, as you know, we have a lot of visitors here today, who are not visitors, but Georgians
that are signing up to run for office, and so the chair, due to our schedule, has decided
to, well, they're going to recognize one, and that's our senior member in Washington.
So I'm applying the other no to both parties and all others, but we are very honored to
have with us our senior United States Senator David Perdue.
Senator Perdue has been a great champion for agriculture, the military presence here
in the state cutting regulations, helping being a partner with us and growing jobs here
here in Georgia, so we're delighted to have him with us and please make welcome Senator
David Perdue.
Thank you.
It's a real honor to be here.
I want to thank you for what you guys do for our state and our country.
This is really where it's at.
I brag on you all the time in Washington.
I tell them state government is where government works.
You guys work here.
You don't go home until you get the budget done, and I so respect that.
But Democrats and Republicans right here in this body will fight with each other and finally
get to something called compromise so we can go home, you go home, and you live under
the laws that you write.
And I think people in Washington could learn a lot from what we do here in Georgia right
here in this body and across the hall over there in the Senate.
And I want to thank you for that.
Third thing I want to just mention real quick is I want to thank you for your participation,
your partnership in dealing with a couple of big items.
One is this disaster relief that we just saw a couple years ago.
You guys were the first.
The state money was the first money that got to our farmers and people down there who
were really hurt by that devastating hurricane.
The second thing is this port that we've been working on for 20 years in the state of Georgia
to get port of the Savannah deep in just five feet.
Thanks to you and now thanks to President Trump, we now have the full funding to get that
done.
But remember, over the last 15 years, the first funding, the first dollars that went into
that port came right here from this body.
And I want to thank you for that partnership.
God bless you for what you do of our state and our country.
God bless you.
Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay, we're now going on to morning orders. Morning orders. Chair, the house will
remain at order. Chair recognizes for a morning order. The Chair of the
Natural Resources and Environment Committee Chairman Lynn Smith.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and good morning, everyone.
I will begin by saying thank you for so many things, but I don't know how to express to
you what it's like to be a recipient of the body when we're not divided along party
lines when we're united for the need of one of our members when the people in our hallway,
when the speaker, our leadership, agencies all come together, it is so overwhelming and
And so supportive and strong.
And I had, I love geometry in high school and I liked it so much because of all these
theorems and if you would just learn the theorem you stood a good chance of solving that problem.
And that day when I saw everyone there I kept thinking, oh, it really works not just on
a math page, and there is a statement, a theorem that says the whole is greater than the sum
of all of its parts.
You are my whole, thank you.
The chair recognizes the remainder of the morning orders will be limited to one minute each and the chair recognizes representative J Collins for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the House. If you would, please turn your attention to this good group of folks I got from Villarica High School. If you'll stand up, please in the gallery.
We've got some good folks from Bill or Casco here.
Let's welcome to the People's House.
Thank you.
Chair recognizes representative Stovall
for a morning order.
This. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. In members today, in honor of Black History Month and Women's
Month, I will recognize Virginia Walden Ford. She spurred her passion for educational
opportunity as inspiring families, filmmakers, and lawmakers to make positive changes. Look
at the 2019 movie, Miss Virginia, by Netflix, to get a glimpse of her struggle with DC schools.
In 2003, Mrs. Ford, along with thousands of courageous parents, convinced Congress and
President Bush to enact the nation's first ever opportunity scholarship.
Program for low-income children stuck in dangerous and low-performing schools.
This program allows them to attend private schools by boosting federal funding for traditional
schools and public schools.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Capitol that we can recognize for their accomplishments.
and I have one of those individuals here with me today.
I have 10th grader, Caleb Chambers.
Here with me, Caleb is an eagle scout.
He's just been promoted to that rank
within the scouting system.
He's also an ordained minister and just so much
in our community, and that's a testament
just so the family that he's came from.
And we're so glad to have Caleb and his dad,
Chessley, here with us.
We all stand up and let us recognize you in the house.
Chair recognizes representative Dunahoo for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House.

You can stand up with, thank you for coming.
recognizes Representative Scofield for a morning order.
Representative Scofield, Chair recognizes Representative Lopez Romero for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to take a minute today to commemorate
yesterday as a bloody Sunday, and also talk about the opportunity that I had to be able
to travel to Montgomery and Selma. To visit not just across the bridge, but also the
the Peace and Justice Memorial Center,
which is a lynching memorial
and wanted to be able to read out today
the two names, the three names in Winett County
of individuals that were documented
to have been lynched in our county.
On January 28th, 1882, Mr. Thomas Muffet.
Ms. Muffet, February 12th, 1882, Williams-Smell, April 8th, 1911, Charles Hill.
Thank you for it.
Let's have a moment, please.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes representative Henson for a morning order.
Okay, Chair recognizes representative Bees more for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good morning, colleagues.
I rise to let you know that Georgia is one of the top three states with the highest maternal
mortality rate, with black women being the most likely to die prior to and after child
birth.
In addition, there is a grave shortage of OB physicians practicing in Georgia.
With the death of a mother, the question becomes, if there's no spouse, what family member
of will assume responsibilities of that child
and possibly other children.
How will this affect one's employment?
Are grandparents expected to step up?
I would without hesitation, but I am able to do so
unlike most grandparents.
My daughter had complications during both of her pregnancies
four year old and two year old.
Unlike these women, women she had access
to excellent healthcare because of the insurance she has.
Let's expand Medicaid so this story will be the norm
and not the exception.
Thank you, Mrs. Speaker.
Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good morning.
It's a great honor for me to stand here today and talk a little bit about and talk about
the accomplishments that that our Atlanta Braves had last year.
You know, some people call them America's team,
but they're our team, they're our Atlanta Braves.
With us today from the organization,
we have Derek Schiller, president and CEO,
Mike Plant, president and CEO
of the Braves Development Company, Greg Heller,
executive vice president and chief legal officer.
And one of the voices of the Braves,
not only of Braves, but I also remember he's a falcon.
So we have Brian Jordan with us here today.
I'm not going to read this resolution, but I just want to tell you a little bit about
some of the phenomenal things that we did last year.
We won our 19th Division title in franchise history, which really we're back to back in
L. East Champions the last two years, and you know, last time we started springing together
a few old things, some good things happened, so we're looking forward to that as it comes
around.
We had three all-star players, Ronald Okunye Jr., Mike Soroka, and Freddie Freeman.
We had three National League Silver sluggers, Ronald Okunye Jr., Ozzie Albis, and Freddie
Freeman.
We had the 2019 National League Defensive Player of the Year, Freddie Freeman.
The 2019 National League comeback player, the year Josh Donaldson, and the 2019 National
Stolen Baselator, Ronald Okunye Jr.
And we just want to say that hopefully the weather or break here shortly, we can start
getting outside and playing some baseball and we're looking forward to some exciting things.
And I think Derek Schiller is going to give us a few words.
Thank you, Speaker.
Thank you, Trey.
Everybody here, I want to thank you on behalf of our entire organization for supporting
the braze.
Obviously, we're a Lannis team, we're Georgia's team and everybody here who has done so
much great work for the state of Georgia. One of the things you also do is really support
our hometown team. We really appreciate it. You know, all of our players are down in
spring training right now down in Sarasota, or else they would have all joined me in this
appreciation. Trey, I want to thank you specifically for helping with the resolution for our achievements
in 2019, but I think myself, my plant, Brian Jordan, Greg Heller, who are all here, quite
And frankly, in 2020, we want you to be doing a resolution that is achieving and celebrating
the World Series.
So we're hopeful that we can do that.
Thank you for having us.

This morning I bring to you House Bill 900,
which creates not a new tag,
but a new improved design for the breast cancer license plate tag.
This tag generates funds to provide breast cancer education,
screening and treatment to many underserved women in Georgia.

go to women who come from a racial ethnic minority
and three out of every four counties in Georgia
benefit from some grant from these funds.
So please join me in supporting all breast cancer patients
in Georgia with this new design, the very brand new
Prescancer Tag for Georgia.
Thank you.

House Bill 1003.
House Bill 1003 by Representative Burns, the Lord 59th and
All those to be entitled an act to amend Code Section 15662, the fiscal to Georgia annotated relating the number of judges and superior courts this bill have refer to the committee on judiciary.
That committee recommends that this bill do pass.
Chair recognizes majority leader Burns to present the bill.
Thank you Madam Chair. Good morning colleagues.
This morning I bring you H.B.1003.
This bill would add an additional superior court judge in the Giche superior court circuit,
which is down in southeast Georgia, is comprised of Bullet County, F&M County, Jenkins County
and Scrooven County, represented by Chairman Hitchens, Chairman Tancersley and Chairman
Parrish and myself.
Little background on the district, F&M County is one of the fastest growing counties in
this state has been for a number of years and a fast one of the fastest growing counties
in the country.
So we have a tremendous growth in population there.
Bullock County, Staceburg, Georgia is also a very fast growing county as well and is
most of all of you know it's home to Georgia Southern University.
Now, I know personally as many of you do about the judges in your circuits, I'm aware of
their schedules, their hard workers, they do a great job in administering justice in
And that circuit, and this is one more tool that would help them make sure that justice
is taken care of in an approved manner.
Now the administrative office of the courts has certified last year due to the circuit's
workload is qualified for one additional judge.
That circuit was named number one circuit in the state qualifying because of its workload.
All of the judges in the circuit, their workload has been certified as them doing one and a
half times the workload of the judges and other circuits.
This is a bill that's been, we've not
have a new judge in that circuit since 1995.
So the time is of the essence that we help these gentlemen
and those that would feel this are the judge's ship,
with us a lady or a gentleman, but it's time
that we address the issues and the workload of that.
I would ask this body's favorable consideration
of HB1003 creating an additional judge ship
in the Gichi Circuit in Southeast Georgia.
Madam Chair, if there are any questions,
I'd be glad to try to answer them.
There are no questions.
Thank you.
It asks for your favourable consideration.
You'll be.
