four years. All right. I think this mic is yours. Thank you. Is that right? Yeah. Sounds like it. All right. Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to go ahead and start the meeting and hope for a quorum.
Let's see where Matt go. He was ready. He was ready.
this time of year especially with the holidays coming up I think we need a
order prayer to get us going so you don't mind let us pray dear Lord thank you
for this joint session the House of Senate Judiciary committees thank you
for the work that's been going on the last few weeks get ready for the
session the starts January the 12th which we put up on the altar to you we
Thank you for this holy Christmas season.
Thank you for new year.
We pray for a wisdom, justice, and moderation
in the weeks and months to come in Christ's name, amen.
Amen.
All right, before we get started,
I want to make sure everybody's had an opportunity
to look over the, I guess, biographical information
of the two parties that we're going to be dealing with today.
Everybody got a chance to look at it.
All right.
We're going to start out with Miss Younggo, if she's here.
Come on up.
Big chairs.
All right, Miss Younggo, I haven't done a lot of these.
So I think if you have anything you want to tell the committee
before we get started here.
Sure.
So my name is Emily Youngo.
I'm here for the clerk of the business court position.
As you know, court administration, as you can see from my resume,
I've had 10 years of service over in various roles,
serving Georgia's judiciary, had the honor
of working with Chairman Gunter when he was a judge.
When I served with our superior court judges,
and some of you as well when we were dealing
with legislative matters.
But general court administration is really my bread
and butter, what I enjoy.
So it would be an honor to work with Judge Hammerick again
and serve our stage due to sheering that way.
If you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them.
Does that work for you?
Members of the committee, my past history,
no one Miss Youngo and the quality of work
that she does is I consider that very high work
and she's always done a good job, so anybody have a question?
question. I don't think we can vote just yet. All right. You want to call up the next.
We have a question. Oh, okay. Sorry. You've got an impressive resume. I see you worked
for five years for former Justice Namias and then also Senator Johnny Isaacson. I did.
Among many other courts and elected officials and definitely and impressed with your background.
Thank you, thank you very much.
All right, got one more, 18.
I'm looking at your resume, and I know typically when you put things on your resume, you want
to put things that are impressive.
Why did you decide to put this you graduated from Auburn University on your resume?
You know, it's funny.
I actually did think what questions I might get, and it's funny I did, consider that to
be a question I might be getting.
You know, dealing with Judge Hammark, you have to have someone that can give a war eagle
here and there.
So I figured that was actually a plus for him, but I do understand for some of the people
in this committee that that might be a con, but I'm very proud of my education at all.
That's true.
That sure could be work.
All right.
You're off.
All right.
I think that's all the questions.
Thank you, Ms. Younggo.
All right, so now we will move on to the presentation from Frank O'Connell, who's currently our
revenue commissioner for the state and just a little bit of background.
When we created the new tax court, we include the same type of confirmation process like
we see we have for our business court where we have to approve the judge for the court
has been appointed by the governor and as chairman Gunter as reference we we're here
as a joint group because the law allows the chairman at their discretion to call this
as a joint hearing and so at this time we will also now call up Mr. O'Connell if you
want to come up and introduce yourself and we'll also take questions from the committee
We will hold on the action as we try to make sure that in the Senate's side we get a quorum
Good morning
Good morning
If it's a please the chairman. I'd like to make a couple of remarks. Yes, sir the floor is yours
Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committees for having me here today
My name is Franco Connell, and I'm honored to appear before you today as Governor
Kempst nominee to serve as Chief Judge of the Georgia Tax Court. I'm also honored
to be joined today by some of my friends and colleagues from over the years, and I'd
be remiss if I didn't mention my wonderful wife, Sheila, without her support. I
certainly wouldn't be here today.
Well, my job has been difficult, but a real privilege
to serve my wife as one of our state's health care heroes
and her job is definitely more difficult in mine.
I started at the Department of Revenue almost 23 years
ago and served in a number of positions,
including General Counsel, Deputy Commissioner
now Commissioner. Before that I worked in public accounting for 10 years. I've been a member
of the bar for almost four decades since graduating from Notre Dame Law School. And speaking
of Notre Dame, well my alma mater may have sat out the bull season this year. I have never
sat out when it comes to addressing difficult or complex legal questions and I don't plan
start now. My view on being a judge and a commissioner is very similar. Neither role makes
me a politician or a policymaker. Instead these roles are meant to interpret or apply the
law as drafted by the General Assembly and signed by the governor. As Commissioner, Deputy
Commission and General Counsel, I have occasionally seen areas where the law or the department
was not applying the law correctly in my view. And we have worked to address that through
legislative cleanup bills, policy bulletins and regulations. At the department, I've also
had the privilege of working alongside other agencies on economic development. We've held
countless calls with businesses looking
to invest in Georgia or expand their operations
in our state.
And in those calls, I can say that I consistently
hear how one draw for these businesses who are
considering coming to Georgia is our stable regulatory
environment.
Georgia businesses and Georgia families
need stability as they plan their futures here
in the state.
Taxes are a necessary part of our society,
but they're also a major line item in everyone's budgets.
My commitment to you, for as long as I'm chief judge,
is that our rulings will be clear and reliable,
because that is what our taxpayers in the state deserve.
Thank you again, Chairman, for having me today.
And thank you to our governor for nominating me,
and now I stand ready to answer any questions.
Thank you, Commissioner, and appreciate your service
to our state throughout your career.
And I know this kind of moves quickly today,
but it's such an important role.
I think the citizens of our state
need to have a court like this set up this independent.
And I think it's such an important role for those
who have to go in front of you with this new court
that we've set up.
and I'd appreciate your willingness to serve us
as citizens in this capacity.
You do have a question from the committee,
Senator Karpatcher.
Thank you so much.
I'm very thankful that we're gonna finally get
this court going and also thankful that we have
someone as qualified as yourself
to put yourself out there for the position.
I guess my question is just about the backfill
for the position that you're leaving.
Since I've agreed to carry a bill for your current agency,
I would like to know that you have a solid succession plan.
Yes, and of course that has been discussed
with the governor's office and they've asked
for my opinions on things and I think shortly after
this concludes the governor's office
will announce the succession.
So, yes, a lot of thought has gone into that Senator.
Chairman Tillery.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
O'Connor, your credentials are impeccable.
You've done this for a long, long time.
We look forward to seeing you, hopefully, in this role.
I have a question, the new court,
but clearly what we've also done
is move an admin court now into a judicial role.
We've moved it out underneath the executive put it
in the judicial branch.
What role then do you think starry decisis should play
in your decisions?
Do you think you're just completely new court
and it's all new or do you think that there is some role
for starry decisis in the, from the decisions
that came from the tax tribunal?
Well, certainly as far as starry decisis,
the statute provides that it applies to the tax court
and the tax court needs to follow its prior decisions.
I don't think it makes it clear whether the tribunal decisions have that same status,
but certainly before deviating from accepted decisions and laid down decisions, there
should be a very good reason to deviate, so I would expect to follow the prior decisions
of the tribunal.
Absolutely.
Some statutory reason, otherwise.
Yes, or it were some higher judicial decision. Yes
Representative Reeves
Thank you chairman
You know, I've met some people who've studied broad some people who went to animal IU some people who've done tax at Georgetown
You've done it all you did Ireland Quebec Georgetown
tax
Courses in addition to getting your degree from NYU tax so very impressed without as I was driving down
here today from going out thinking about insurance later today that we'll be
working on two things came to mind with tax court number one from doing some
local property tax thing and reading some decisions usually the
terminology is you know government and taxpayer and moving into the
judicial rollout occurred you look at the individual cases there's a person
there's a citizen or a small business who's an employer who purchases goods and
deliver services and there's a story behind that and these tax decisions, it could wipe
out a whole year of hard work or decade and so they're not just a taxpayer, there's
an individual story with a lot riding on these cases and I know you'll look at those
individually as a judge and then secondly one case that came out this year, Chief Justice
Nells Peterson wrote at the Eternal Vigilance Action Case, a comment you made sort of
follow it up on that about you've got the general assembly making the law you
got the governor signs it and then the judges interpret it agency rule making
definitely you know look at what did get passed and keep the citizens on on a
level playing field with agencies don't don't have a bunch of things made up
that aren't in the law that go against the citizens in these cases stick to
what's in the books, just as that Chevron,
eternal vigilance action case said this year
from the George Spring Court would definitely come in
that decision too, as well as the federal U.S.
Spring Court Chevron battle that went on for decades
and it said, let's have citizens on a level playing field
with the government not having the government
have deference at the agency level.
Yes, sir.
And I very much respect that was here when the statute
was passed a few years ago.
I guess the department used to argue
because the law allowed us to, for deference to anything
that we wrote and someone went
so far as to say, you know, a position
that our attorneys came up with on the way down to the court.
It wasn't quite that broad, but now it's limited
to the regulations that are properly promulgated
and really that is the most that should get deference.
And sometimes those regulations go a little bit
further than they should and I and I know that because there was one that I was
worried about for well before I came to the department and got that one
changed a couple years ago at the urging of members of my advisory committees
and it really led to a trap for the unwary and I'm really glad that that's
fixed. You hear questions from the committee. All right thank you
commissioner we have a quorum now for both committees that are present so at
this time the chair will entertain a motion and I believe the proper motion will be a motion
to accept. Is that the correct Mr. Walker? Do we have any motions from the committee?
We have a motion to accept the nomination from full leader hatch. I guess you have a
wringer in here with a full leader. So a full leader right? Get that job. Okay. And we
We have a second from Representative Mata-Han.
Any discussion on the motion?
All those in favor of the motion, please raise your hand.
It is unanimous.
Congratulations.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.
I greatly appreciate it.
Thank you for this opportunity to serve.
Yeah, thank you.
All right, I'll turn it back over to Chairman Gunter.
I'm going to go to the office.
This is the office.
Please.

Here's the
