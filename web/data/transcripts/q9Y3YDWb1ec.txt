questions. Okay, do I hear a motion have a motion in second is in opposition. Okay, it's on Senate bill 130 have a move in second. Any opposition? It's on. Okay, on your desk, you'll have a
to Senate Bill 162, LC-339816S.
Go on a call on Chair Lady Cooper to explain that to us.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
On page five, about halfway down,
on line 110, that, as I said,
the anesthesiologist assistants
would be under the direct supervision
of duly licensed physician.
And that's not they are under the supervision and it should have been an anesthesiologist and we changed that one word.
Okay. You've heard that change. Any questions? Okay. On Senate Bill 162 by Substitute, is there a motion?
No, no.
Have a motion and a second any opposition? It's on. Okay. Senate Bill 191.
move in second any opposition it's on Senate bill 199 moved in seconded any
opposition it's on Senate bill 201 moved in seconded any opposition it's on Senate
bill 213 moved in seconded any opposition it's on Senate bill 241 moved in
seconded any opposition it's on Senate bill 293 moved in seconded any
opposition? It's on. Okay, on your desk you should have a copy of Senate Bill 298,
Rule Substitute, LC481601S, and that's Chairman Levitt to explain that. So,
too. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is an amendment to or change to the Senate
until $298, it came through the Judiciary Committee
and this is a bill basically that would have allowed
for a direct appeal on, well out for a direct appeal
on cases where sovereign immunity had been pled
and the court had ruled it did not apply.
And so the local jurisdiction or the state
or whoever was asserting sovereign immunity
would have a direct appeal.
We added in committee legislative immunity.
And then we also took an extra added legislative privilege.
So the committee, the rule sub, adds legislative privilege
and pulls all that into a separate section
to make it clear that that particular right of appeal
applies in civil and criminal cases
and does not have to be, well, it has to be exercised
within than 30 days of any judgment or a ruling.
you're not limited just one if it's legislated privilege or
immunity because that could arise multiple times in a case
in the course of discovery and that's what I'm saying.
So that's the substitute, Mr. Jim.
OK, you've heard the explanation or any questions.
OK, don't see any questions.
Is there a motion?
No.
It's been moved and seconded.
Any opposition?
It's on.
That sets our counter.
That should keep us busy for a while this afternoon.
Thank you all.
Thank you very much.
