TRANSCRIPT
----------
Hello.
You want to see me laugh?
Can we see?
Hello.
Hey.
I know y'all are both on a tight deadline.
And okay, you are on vacation and probably don't want to spend a whole lot of time.
Was everybody able to look over the recommendations that we sent out?
Yes. Yes, sir. And I appreciate you all sending me your recommendations. I don't we haven't heard of NAMM is going to be on or not, but if you all have any questions about the recommendations, I'd be happy to entertain those.
If not, I think our goal here is just to vote on the report,
and then get it signed and sent,
because today is actually the deadline to get it in.
So, Mr. Chair, I had one question,
and then one thing that I wanted to say,
the question is, I still don't know what a retention is.
Were we able to shed any light on that?
So what I found is there are these nurse retentionists that are hired to help, I guess, retain nurses and they just, I think it may have something to do with HR or just, you know, helping hospitals keep nurses in house and to, you know, better the work environment.
I know that was a recommendation during the from from testimony that we had one of the meetings and so I didn't I didn't see any harm including it.
But if there's anyone else that knows more about nurse retentionist than I do, I'd be happy to turn it over to them.
Yeah, I'm just not sure what the action item is, but you know, we, there are a lot of recommendations in this report and some of them are.
Budgetary, some of them are maybe legislation, some of them are pretty broad, but I think they represent a good picture of all the things that we heard at the committee hearings.
I personally have a problem, as you know, with number one,
and I'd sent alternate language that I suggested.
And that's a patient safety issue for me.
So if you don't mind, Mr. Chair,
I'm just gonna read what I sent you if that's okay.
Yeah, that's fine.
Yeah, so I do recognize the excellent training
that our CNRA's receiving Georgia, however,
Anesthesiologists and surgeons
complete an additional four to six years
of training after medical school
so that they're ready to take on the entire
perioperative experience
and handle life-threatening complications when they arise.
I believe that health care is best delivered by a team
of professionals, especially in our rural areas,
with less backup when things go wrong,
which thankfully is not very often,
but when it happens, it puts you, it's a real thing.
And so I recommend rewarding number one,
as follows, the committee recognizes
a shortage of medical personnel in rural areas,
including anesthesia.
And that this creates problems for surgical care.
The committee also acknowledges the excellent training
that's urination receiving Georgia
and their ability to deliver anesthesia in a team setting.
The committee encourages continued conversation
about ways to optimize the delivery of anesthesia
in rural areas.
So that was just the language that I suggested
to replace what was in number one.
I don't expect everyone in the committee to agree with me.
And so with that, I support the report,
except for number one.
And so for that reason, I would have to vote against the report.
So that's the end of my little next story.
Thank you.
Well, thank you, Kay.
And thanks for your work on this committee.
I know, I know your stance on number one
and there are some disagreements there.
Hopefully, you know, during the century,
we can find some middle ground.
Mr. Chairman, I will point out if it's okay.
The governor had a task force to study
healthcare workforce in Georgia
and number one was one of the recommendations
that came out of the governor's healthcare workforce task
force and the challenge is what I'm told is that it's an impediment to hiring surgeons
in these small, small real hospitals, the language and the liability that the surgeon
feels like they're taking on when they're not trained on anesthesiology.
So we just have a difference of opinion on the policy.
I do certainly respect Dr. Kirkpatrick's position,
but I just disagree.
So I fully support the report as written
and the recommendations as written
and I'll make a motion at the appropriate time
to approve that.
Mr. Chairman, yeah, I'm happy the second that motion.
motion. Do we have enough people to vote this?
Okay.
Then yeah, I will second.
I will second chairman Walker's motion.
Okay. Well, then there's a motion in a second on the table.
The motion is to pass the report as is.
All those in favor.
We'll say aye.
And those opposed like sign.
No.
Okay.
So it's two to one in favor of passage.
So we will have this report submitted.
I appreciate you all taking the time today and for your work over the last year on this.
I think there are a lot of really good recommendations that we've gotten out of it.
Hopefully we'll be able to turn these into some good legislation in January.
So thank y'all.
Merry Christmas.
If I don't see you and I appreciate you all taking the time today.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas!
