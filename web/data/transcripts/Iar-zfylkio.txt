Representative Martahan.
Well, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
and good morning members.
Y'all today it is my honor to introd
introduce Pastor Kevin Boy and his
lovely wife Don today.
Kevin Pastor Kevin Boy is an outreach
pastor at Westeridge Church in Dallas
where he has led the church's local and
global outreach initiatives since 2018.
That includes Hope for Christmas, a
multi-church Christmas outreach program
Birth at West Ridge that supplies gifts
and food to about 3,500 families in
10,000 children in the Northwest Georgia
region every year at Christmas time.
Y'all, it's a unbelievable endeavor
and something that I had never seen and
I could not believe until I saw it when
I went there.
He also leads a church's special needs
ministry which recently opened a 10,000
square foot building constructed for the
exclusive use of individuals with
special needs and its growing foster
care ministry.
And prior to becoming an ordained
minister, joining his older brother, uh,
Brian, the founding pastor of West
Ridge, and his late father as Christian
ministers, Kevin served for 25 years at
the Georgia Hospital Association.
Kevin is a great friend. He is a
wonderful pastor. He is a man of our
community and a man of faith. And I am
so excited to welcome him here into the
people's house.
>> Thank you.
>> Thank you all so much. Um, I wanted to
first thank my dear friend and
representative Martin Mahan for inviting
me to briefly share with you and pray
for you this morning. What an honor.
It's not only a huge honor for me to
stand at this podium under the gold
dome. It's truly a full circle moment
for me having spent so many days here in
my previous career advocating for
Georgia hospitals, attending numerous
committee meetings and celebrating the
great work that hospitals do throughout
the state. I'm so proud and thankful
that that for that time in my life and
I'm thrilled to be back under the gold
dome after all these years. this time as
a pastor. It truly is a surreal moment
for me. Having been born in 1969,
I remember the days when you had to wait
for the local
and national news to come on the
television or radio to really find out
what was happening in the world. If you
wanted to get your sports score of your
favorite team, you had to wait for the
morning paper to hit your driveway. Do
you remember those days? Um, if you
wanted if that team played on the West
Coast, well, you were out of luck. That
the uh the game ended much too late for
the morning print edition and you had to
find out the the scores from a different
source. Uh, you needed to find some real
in-depth information on anything. Uh,
you had to go to the public library. You
remember those days? Uh, while the
world, can we agree that the world has
changed? Uh, today, thanks to
technology, it takes me about 5 seconds
to go on my phone and look up something
as random as who was the 1935
best actor winner in the Academy Awards.
And thanks to the internet and now
artificial intelligence, we can access
an avalanche of information on any topic
that you can think of instantaneously.
But do you know what the amazing irony
of this whole explosion of information
is?
As much information is now instantly
available to all of us, what is the one
thing that we seem to be missing more
than ever? I would say it's the truth.
Can we all agree that it seems that the
truth is so much harder to ascertain
these days? Here is how we how is it
that we can see all of the same videos,
look at the same pictures, and come to
completely different conclusions on what
actually happened.
We all ask is the video AI generated or
modified? Was this pic photoshopped?
Does the distributor of the video have a
political agenda? So, we have evolved
into a culture that is desperately
searching for the truth. And because we
bought Satan's lies that are tr that the
truth is relative and everyone has their
own truth. We're living in a sea of
confusion which only leads to anger and
bitterness and depression and anxiety
and all the chaos that we see in our
culture today.
I am here to remind you as a pastor that
despite what we're hearing in the media,
there is an absolute truth that we can
always depend on. In John 14:6, Jesus
says, "I am the way
and the truth and the life. No one comes
through the Father except through me."
In a world that is desperately searching
for the truth, may I submit to you today
that we've had access to it all along
in Jesus and this God inspired book
called the Bible.
Through this divinely inspired book, we
have all we need to navigate this world
in truth.
Pastor Tony Evans defines the truth as
the absolute objective standards of
object objective standard of God's
perspective on any given subject which
exists independently of human feelings,
opinions or consensus.
In other words, the truth is not
subjective.
Our goal should be to align ourselves
with God's perspective on all things
because he is the only source of truth,
not personal or cultural preferences.
And when we reject God's truth, chaos
ensues. And I think we can agree that
we're seeing that in our culture today.
I know some of you here don't believe
that Jesus is the truth, the light and
the way. And my challenge to you is
this. Put aside any politics and
investigate it for yourself by reading
this book and making a more informed
decision about Jesus.
In John 8:31-32,
Jesus told those who believed in him,
"If you continue in my word, you really
are my disciples.
You will know the truth, and the truth
will set you free."
What a great promise that is. For those
of you who identify as Christ followers,
and I know there's a lot of you here
today, I want to acknowledge this from
my many years of experience here at the
Capitol. It's extremely difficult to
live out your faith here. I know that.
And let's be honest, some of you have
completely lost your way spiritually.
In James 4 7 through verses 7-8, James
encourages believers to submit to God
and surrender to him as your ultimate
authority.
In the next verse, he says, "Draw near
to God and he will draw near to you."
But notice this, you need to make the
first move.
In these chaotic times when your
constituents are drowning in information
but starving for the truth, we can we
all agree that while your job here at
the capital is so important and so
thankful for you.
No political party or leader is going to
solve our problems, no political party
or leader has a monopoly on the truth.
But Jesus is truth.
His word is the guide book for our
lives. He is the only hope we have in
this world.
And when we finally start living our
lives like God is telling the truth,
only then will be will we be truly free.
Thank you guys so much uh for your
attention and this great honor to be
here today. Let's pray. If you would
stand and let's pray.
God, thank you so much for this
opportunity. Lord, I thank you for every
man and woman who are here this morning,
especially our our uh elected officials
who are doing the work that you've
called them to do. Lord, what a huge
responsibility, especially during these
tumultuous times, Lord. I pray right now
that you would that we would walk in
truth, the truth of your word, the truth
of your promises, Lord. And I pray, God,
that we would not put our faith in
parties and and leaders, Lord, but only
in you, Lord. I pray for each one of our
legislators, Lord, who are elected by
the people of Georgia. I pray that you
would just give them wisdom and
discernment in all things, Lord. And I
pray that they would proceed in
everything that they do with the
attitude of you, not I, Lord. I pray
that you would put you first in all
things, Lord. Thank you for this great
state of Georgia and the incredible
leaders that we have. We're so blessed
to be in this state and we just pray
that you would just continue to prosper
uh our people, Lord. And I pray that we
as a state would put you first in all
things. Thank you again for this
incredible opportunity. We ask for
blessings on this day and all the
proceedings that are that are to follow.
In Jesus name we pray. Amen.

demonstrated extraordinary skill,
leadership, and talent throughout his
illustrious baseball career.
And whereas by the age of 11, Jones was
on a youth select baseball team that
traveled to Japan to pay to play
internationally.
And whereas Jones signed with the
Atlanta Braves as a free agent at the
age of 16 and played with Danville of
the Appalachian League, the Gulf Coast
League Braves, and Class A Min. And
whereas he made his major league debut
during the 1996 season with the Atlanta
Braves. And whereas as the 1996 World
Series, he became the youngest player
ever to hit a home run in the postseason
and the second player ever to home run
in his first two World Series at bats.
Whereas in honor of his legacy, his
number 25 was retired by the Atlanta
Braves on September 9th, 2023.
And whereas induction into the National
Baseball Hall of Fame is one of the
highest honors a baseball player can
receive, recognizing not only
exceptional athletic achievements, but
also a lasting impact on the sport. Now,
therefore, be it resolved by the House
of Representatives that the members of
this body recognize and commend Andrew
Jones upon his induction into the

Good morning, colleagues. I'll be Good
morning. Oh, sorry. I'll be delivering
our black history speech today um in in
in enlightening you on a living legend.
So today, I rise in recognition of Dr.
Jonetta Cole during Black History Month.
Dr. Cole is a living legend, the kind
that permeates entirely the entirety of
America.
Let me tell you about Dr. Janetta Cole,
sister president in 1987 of Spellelman
College. She made history by appointing
Dr. Cole was the first black president
of Spellelman College.
While that title alone was
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. While that title
alone isn't just a milestone, it's about
her rigorous intellect and unwavering
belief in sisterhood that changed the
landscape of American education.
Under Dr. Cole's leadership, Spellelman
didn't just grow, it ascended. She
launched the school's first campaign
raising an unprecedented $113 million.
This wasn't just about the money. It was
about proving that an H.B.CU for black
women was a blue chip investment.
She showed her sisters that we are
worthy of investment.
She also oversaw Camille Olivia Banks
Hanks Cosby Academic Center and ensured
Spellelman is consistently and was
consistently ranked as one of the best
liberal art colleges in the country.
Dr. Cole's impact rippled far beyond
Spellman's gates. She was an
anthropologist
an anthropologist and dedicated her life
to study African dysphora.
I see that. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and
for allowing me to honor a living
legend, Dr. Janetta Cole, who is the
first and longest standing president of
Spellelman College. Thank you. I yield
the well.
>> Great school and a great American.

Spellelman and education.

>> recognized for a morning order. Of
course, if you have run red, please join
me. Today, we have advocates. Today, we
have advocates here from the American
Heart Association. We'll read this
briefly. Uh nearly half of all women
over the age of 20 are living with some
form of cardiovascular disease. Yes, mo
yet most women remain unaware of their
personal risk factors or the unique ways
heart disease can present in women.
Whereas women often experience heart
attack symptoms that differ from men
such as shortness of breath, nausea,
back or jaw jaw pain, extreme fatigue or
dizziness which can lead to delayed
treatment and poor outcomes when these
symptoms are not recognized. Significant
disparities persist with black,
Hispanic, Latino, indigenous women
facing higher rates of cardiovascular
disease and barriers to prevention,
diagnosis, and equitable access to care.
Red light is on. Ladies, gentlemen from
the American Heart Association, would
you please stand? Let's welcome them to
the people's house. Yes. Thank you for
the work that you guys are doing. And
y'all just know that heart disease kills
more women than all cancers combined.

pin, stop by my desk.

So members, if you get close to your

House Bill 985. Mr. Clerk, will you read
the caption of House Bill 985?
>> House Bill 985 by Representative Bonner,
the 73rd
to be entitled act to amend part three
of article 2, chapter 4, title 38 of the
official code of Georgia annotated
relating to Georgia veteran cemeteries.
So has revised the terms of eligibility
for persons to be buried in Georgia
veteran cemeteries. This bill haven't
referred to the committee on defense and
veteran affairs. That committee
recommends that this bill do passported
bill.
Mr. Chairman, you are recognized to
present House Bill 985. Chairman Bonner.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning,
colleagues. Uh, last session, um, the
House was gracious enough to pass House
Bill 53, which, um, made increase the
eligibility for certain members of our
National Guard and reserves to be buried
in our state veteran cemeteries. Uh, it
was certainly uh, a great thing for our
veterans throughout the state. uh this
year, House Bill 985
uh clarifies some of that language and
by all uh accounts would simply would be
a very simple bill that addressed some
simple issues. But uh there's more to
the story of House Bill 985. Uh thanks
to the work of Commissioner Patricia
Ross of our Department of Veteran
Services, they identified an additional
group that is federally recognized to be
buried in one of our state cemeteries.
So if you would bear with me for just a
moment, I'm going to tell you a little
bit of the story of this very specific
group who will now have this benefit.
As the Vietnam War raged in Southeast
Asia during the 1960s and 70s, a
separate United Statesbacked operation
was also underway in neighboring Laos.
Known as the Secret War, the CIA
recruited tens of thousands of Mung
soldiers for covert operations. These
secret fighters were known as special
guerilla units or SGUs. Their missions
included scouting enemy movements,
fighting on the front lines, recruiting,
rescuing downed American pilots, and
protecting US facilities in Laos. It is
estimated that between 30 and 40,000 M
soldiers died during this secret war
with many more wounded. These brave
fighters consistently fought against
superior odds and inflicted countless
damage to communist communist forces in
Laos.
As the war in Vietnam ended, so did this
secret war. As US forces left Southeast
Asia, the Mung people were left to fend
for themselves and experienced
persecution from the Le Oceanian
government. Many were able to escape to
America, but it was not until 1994 that
the secret war was officially
acknowledged by our government with the
benefit of burial in a national cemetery
to follow in 2018.
It wasn't until 2000 that federal law
allowed these members to become US
citizens. So, the question could be
asked, why is this important to you and
me and the people of Georgia? Well, as
former CI director William Colby summed
it up, the efforts of the Mung Special
Guerilla units saved more than 50,000
American lives in Southeast Asia.
Friends,
that is 50,000 fewer names to be
engraved on the Vietnam War Memorial in
Washington, DC.
That's more men like Chairman Hitchens,
Representative Williams, and
Representative Griffin being here today.
Now, we are honored, Mr. Speaker, to
have in the gallery uh some of these
Mung fighters. They are accompanied here
today by Commissioner of our Department
of Veteran Services, Trisha Ross, along
with members of the Veterans of Foreign
War that fought alongside these brave
men and women. So, if you would please
stand and let us honor you.
Thank you colleagues for allowing me to
present the bill today. I certainly hope
you will support 985 as this is the
least we can do for these brave men and
women. With that, Mr. Speaker, I'll
stand for any questions.
>> Gentlemen, yield for a question.
Representative Al Williams to your left
is recognized for a question.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is it and thank
you, Mr. Chairman, for this bill. Is it
not true that it's never too late to do
the right thing?
Absolutely. I appreciate the question.
>> Is it not further true that these
gentlemen certainly are responsible for
the saving of many lives during Vietnam?
And I'm sure Colonel Hitchens and
Colonel Griffin agrees with me that
we're just glad we're able to stand here
and recognize them.
>> Absolutely. Thank you for the question.
>> Gentleman has a couple more questions.
Representative Tran is recognized for a
question to your left in the back.
Representative Tran.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, thank you, Mr.
Chairman, for bringing this bill to the
floor. Is it not true that there are
around 5,000 M living in Georgia?
>> Yes, that is correct.
>> One further question.
>> Yes.
>> Is it not true that the children of
these heroes are important members of
the Georgia community because they are
now doctors, teachers, engineers, and
law enforcement in this state.
>> Absolutely. is uh the the M people are a
testament to um grit, determination,
hard work, and what can happen uh when
they do the right thing. And they've uh
this I I would point out this is the
only benefit that the VA provides for
this community. So, it's certainly again
the least we can do here in Georgia.
>> Thank you.
Representative Lynn Smith up the center
aisle is recognized for a question.
>> Thank you, gentlemen. I do.
>> So I join with all the members of the
house to thank you for this initiative.
As the wife of a Vietnam vet, I doubly
appreciate this effort. Thank you.
>> Thank you, chair lady.
>> Representing Sandra Scott
to your right is recognized for
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Uh uh do you
ill?
>> I do.
>> I would just like to say thank you for
bringing this bill forward. Um, as the
others had said, it's never too late to
do the right thing. And I would just
like to say thank you.
>> Well, thank you to my fellow veteran.
It's veterans helping veterans and
appreciate the committee for all their
hard work.
>> Gentleman has no further questions.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the
well.
>> Gentleman has yielded the will. We have
a speaker on the bill in favor of the
bill and that's Representative Patty
Stinson. Representative Stinson is
recognized to speak to the bill, House
Bill 985.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I
rise to today in support of this measure
and to offer a perspective shaped not
only by my role as a state
representative, but also by my 20 years
of experience serving Georgia families
as a funeral home owner. Often families
come to me in moments of grief. And when
the loved ones they are laying to rest
is a veteran, that responsibility
carries an even deeper weight. Our state
veteran cemeteries are sacred grounds.
There are places where Georgia expressed
its gratitude, not in words, but in the
final honors we extend to those who
served. We all know that families does
not always we we all know that life does
not always fit neatly into statutory
boxes. Records sometimes get lost.
Service histories are complicated.
Families may not have every document in
hand, especially when they are grieving.
This bill allows the board to exercise
compassion and common sense, ensuring
that technicalities do not overshadow a
lifetime of service. This bill also
allows the Department of Veteran
Services to set reasonable burial fees.
As someone who works directly with
families navigating funeral expenses, I
know how important transparency and
predictability are.
This allows
uh the department to align fees with
federal allowances or set an appropriate
amount based on operational needs. And
while the revenue goes to the general
fund, it still supports the state's
ability to maintain these cemeteries
with dignity they deserve. Colleagues,
House Bill 985 is about people. It's
about the widow who wants her husband's
service honored even though one document
is missing. It's about the family
seeking clarity in the midst of loss.
It's about ensuring that Georgia's
veteran cemeteries remain a place of
honor, a place of integrity, and a place
of respect. As someone who has stood
beside countless families at their most
vulnerable moments, I can tell you this
bill will help do exactly that. And with
that, colleagues, I respectfully
ask your favorable consideration for
House Bill 985. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I now yield the well.
>> Thank you, Representative. The lady has
yielded the well. That completes our
comments on House Bill 985.
Is there any objection to the previous
question being ordered? Hearing none,
the previous question is ordered. Is
there any objection to agreeing to the
report of the committee which was
favorable to the passage of the bill?
Hearing none, the report of the
committee is agreed to. Shall this bill
now pass? All in favor of the passage of
the bill, we'll vote yes. All those
opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk,
will you unlock the machine?
Have all members voted?
All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk,
will you lock the machine
on the passage of House Bill 985?
The yays are 173, the nays are zero.
This bill hadn't received the requisite
constitutional majority. Is therefore
passed.
Gentlemen, I can't add to what we've
just discussed here, but I can only say
thank you for your service.
Thank you for your dedication to your
fellow man. And God bless you all. Thank
you for being here.

Good morning.
Since I've held this position as your
appropriations chair,
budget discussions have been dominated
by our our significant surplus.
A variety of economic factors resulted
in Georgia having an historically full
bank account.
We filled our revenue shortfall reserve
in 2021
and we've had excess undesated reserves.
On top of that, more recently,
revenue collections have slowed to a
more modest growth and we've
appropriated a large portion of these re
reserves already.
That said, we continue to sit in a very
fortunate position.
I can't count the number of ways that
have been suggested
we spend this surplus,
but I can tell you we've always acted
conservatively and judiciously.
We've always balanced giving money back
to taxpayers with making needed
investments in our state.
We've never paid for ongoing expenses
with one-time money, and we've always
worked hard to maintain a structurally
balanced budget.
Those of you who've served in this house
for some time may remember when the
amended budget was a little sleepy
affair with limited changes and
adjustments.
More recently, our amended budgets have
been filled with activity as we find
one-time uses for this surplus.
Spending these funds in the amended
budget ensures these projects are not
added to our ongoing budget base,
keeping our general appropriations
clean.
So, as you all know,
I have this crystal ball
and I foresee a future where the amended
budget goes on a GLP1.
But for now, we still have some
decisions and investments to make.
House Bill 973, the amended fiscal year
2026 budget is set by a revised revenue
estimate of 42.3 billion.
In addition to the revenue growth, the
governor's revenue estimate for the
amended FY26 budget includes $3.3
billion in undesated surplus funds for a
total revenue adjustment of $4.5 billion
or an 11.9%
increase over the original FY26 budget.
You all know that we in the general
assembly are responsible stewards of
taxpayers dollars. We spend wisely and
when there's extra, we give it back.
Since 2021, we've given back 9.7 billion
dollars to taxpayers through rebates,
tax cuts, and other measures.
We'll continue that tradition by giving
back even more money through this
budget.
While the governor's budget
recommendation recognized funds to
provide income tax rebates, our amended
fiscal year 26 budget reallocates these
funds to provide property tax relief for
Georgia's homeowners, funding $850
million for the homeowner tax relief
grant program.
This grant will reduce next year's tax
bills for homeowners, and we will
continue to work to eliminate property
taxes on your home.
We'll address income taxes through House
Bill 1001, bringing our rate to 4.9%,
keeping Georgia one of the most
affordable states to live and raise a
family.
Before I discuss some of the details in
our line items, allow me to begin by
highlighting some of the key investments
we're making.
Our budget has two statewide items that
you'll see over and over nearly in every
program.
The first recurring item is a one-time
salary supplement of $2,000 to full-time
regular state employees
and school personnel, including preK
through 12 teachers, nurses, nutrition
workers, custodians, and bus drivers.
These supplements will help us retain
essential staff and teachers.
The second recurring item is related to
the state health benefit plan. SHPBP
currently has a healthy reserve fund
balance which the governor recognized in
fiscal year 27 by reducing how much
state agencies pay per employee per
month for health coverage starting in
July.
Our fiscical year 26 budget passes these
savings on to the state agencies a month
earlier. starting in June, saving $21.5
million.
Running a growing state is not cheap,
and this budget spends over $300 million
in workload adjustments, including K
through2, Medicaid, corrections, health
contracts, and DHS out of home care.
These additions are largely associated
with our growing population.
Since 2024, we've used $4.1 billion in
surplus revenues to fund capital
projects with cash, saving taxpayers
over $3 billion in debt payments. The
House amended 26 budget also makes a
significant $82 million cash investment
in capital projects.
In addition to funding most of the
governor's recommended projects, the
House budget also funds a few noteworthy
additional projects. We provided $220
million for a private prison expansion.
While the new Washington County facility
will bring muchneeded safety upgrades to
the correctional system, it does not add
additional bed space, and we're
projected to run out of bed space by
2029.
This private prison expansion will
provide us an additional 480 beds for a
system that is rapidly approaching
capacity. This expansion will give the
state flexibility and it can be
accomplished quickly and affordably.
The House's vision
also provides $ 29.8 8 million to
design, construct, and equip a building
that will house the brand new College of
Optometry at Georgia's Southern
University, filling a tremendous need
for our state.
Georgia has long sent aspiring
optometrists to study in Alabama and
Tennessee.
In hindsight, we should have done this
years ago.
Nobody got it.
Our budget also provides $27 million to
begin design and construction of a new
Georgia Regional Hospital to address
mental health and forensic bed capacity
in our state. We're projected to have
zero forensic beds by 2034.
And this funding is a down payment on a
hospital that will help address this
need by adding 200 forensic beds and 100
mental health beds. These examples
represent just a few of our priorities.
Since you've now had time to read this
budget in its entirety, I'll help you
prepare for your test by highlighting a
few items from each of our major policy
areas.
To help keep Georgia mobile, our budget
makes several investments in
transportation.
I'm sure you've heard of the big ticket
items like 1.7 billion for the I75
express lane expansion, $200 million for
the state route 316 interchange
conversions, and these important
projects are in our budget. We also
provide significant additional funds for
all modes of transportation. We
appropriate an additional $15 million
for airport aid. These dollars have a
significant federal match and our
airports keep economic development in
our communities flying high. We've
agreed to the governor's request of $250
million for local transportation
infrastructure and we're providing $85
million for rural bridge rehab and
increasing $und00 million for local road
resurfacing projects. We've also
committed $4.2 million in improvements
to keep the trains chugging along our
state-owned short road shortline rail
lines
to help keep Georgia educated. This
budget continues to meet our obligations
in K12 and higher education. fully
funding our formulas and projections for
QBE charter systems, promise and special
needs scholarships, AP exams, dual
enrollment completion schools, and hope
scholarships and grants. We're taking
care of our existing facilities with $88
million for major repair and rehab
projects at USG and TCSG.
And finally, we include $300 million to
provide state matching funds for an
endowment to provide needs-based
scholarships.
To help keep Georgia healthy, we're
investing $4.8 million for a grant
program aimed at establishing new new
rural medical and dental clinics. We
funded $3 million for nursing home
quality incentive payments at skilled
nursing facilities and $17.8 8 million
to provide graduate medical education
expansion.
We also provide funds for rural
colarctal screenings and we direct the
department of public health to develop a
strategy to promote awareness and
prevention measures for colarctal and
prostate cancer.
Our budget adds additional funds to out
ofome care.
Our budget fully funds the deficit in
defects and we reinstate foster care
supportive service contracts
to help ensure accountability in that
system. We also provide $15 million for
an integrated child welfare reporting
system that will help enable early
detection and speed up service. This
system is up and running and already
providing results in six counties in our
state. So, we want to make it statewide
to help keep Georgia safe. This budget
makes several investments in the
Department of Corrections to improve our
aging prison infrastructure.
We provide more than $185 million for
capital projects to make needed safety,
security, and technology upgrades.
We also provide additional funds for new
correctional officer positions
to improve our officer to inmate ratio.
and we add significant funds to rising
health, food, and farm costs.
We've also included $4 and a half
million dollars in one-time funds
for dovest domestic violence shelters
and sexual assault centers for their
operational and facility needs.
To help keep Georgia growing, this
budget provides $35 million to the
Georgia Environmental Finance Authority
to establish a state financing and
assistant program for natural gas
infrastructure needed for economic
sorry for natural gas infrastructure
improvements and an additional $50
million in rural infrastructure needed
for economic development. We also
support the governor's recommendation of
$50 million for the state housing trust
fund. These funds will help address
homelessness through matching funds to
local governments and nonprofits, and
they bring with them an up to 4:1 match,
maximizing the impact of our state
dollars
to help take care of our state retirees.
Our budget includes $50 million for the
Employees Retirement System of Georgia
to strategically invest in increasing
the funded ratio to improve the
long-term financial viability of the
pension system and support state
retirees.
These items are just some of the
highlights of this 42.3 billion budget.
We've turned this budget around just
three weeks after it was initially
introduced by our governor.
A task is not possible without the hard
work and late nights from our
subcommittee chairs and the staff of the
House Budget and Research Office. Let's
acknowledge how much work these people
on this front row do for us.
In fact, we've worked on this so hard,
we have made the Senate's job much
easier.
They should be able to just agree and
send it right back.
Seriously, thank you to all the members
of the committee and to those that work
for work with us to get it done. I ask
for your favorable consideration of
HB973.
And with that, Mr. Chair, I'll be glad
to take a few questions.
Chairman, do you yield for questions?
>> Yes. Uh, chair recognizes Representative
Santos for a question.
>> Does the enemy may yield?
>> Yes.
>> Thank you for your hard work to everyone
that was involved. I Isn't it true that
the 1.7 billion is going to relieve
congestion in Henry County, Georgia, and
we're all very excited about that?
>> I think we all hope and pray that that
happens.
Thank you.
>> Thank you.
>> Chair recognizes Representative Barry
for a question.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank
gentlemen to you.
>> Yes.
>> Thank you again for your hard work of
this budget. Um I see the increase of
$200,000 for prostate cancer research
for Clark University and the great
partnership that they do with the
Georgia Medical College. What other
specific investments are going to all of
Georgia's H eight H.B.CU in this budget?
So that's an additional funding for a
grant that's already out there. So it
would make the total of that research
grant $500,000.
And there are, you know, H.B.CU are
included
in, you know, if they're getting other
grants through
other, you know, we nothing has changed
there, I guess I'll say. And I don't
know specific so I don't know that that
exact if if
>> well thank you again. Obviously there's
a lot more we can do. I look forward to
working with you on everything from HBC
security to hope scholarship for HBCU.
Thank you so much.
>> Chair recognizes Representative Bernau
for a question.
>> Thank you. Does a gentleman yield?
>> Yes, ma'am. I did ask you this earlier,
but I want to make sure that we clarify
that the money for the uh schools, you
did say it was for custodians, but also
for our maintenance departments. If you
can check make sure that
>> I I can verify that, but I'm pretty sure
most any employees that are working in
our school systems are receiving this.
We've we've gone back and asked lots of
questions about that. the nutrition
workers. It's had been asked earlier and
they are as a group it's over $28
million additional just for the
nutrition workers.
>> Thank you.
>> Mr. Chairman, do you yield for further
questions?
>> Yes, sir.
>> Chair recognizes Representative Campbell
for a question.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman, uh for your
hard work and for the entire staff. Um I
asked this question earlier but um I am
interested to know does this budget
include incremental funding for the
department of early care and learning
specifically to expand CAPS funding
because as we all know right now we only
have funding to cover 15% of the
eligible families.
So this particular budget does not
include any increases for that but all
that usually takes place in the base
budget and it is in so it will be in
play in the 27 budget.
>> Mr. Chairman, you have no further
questions.
>> Ladies and gentlemen, appreciate your
favorable consideration and thank you.
As the chairman returns to his seat, I
know uh we have a big football game this
weekend, but I think it's safe to say
the MVPs of the House of Representatives
are the U House Budget and Research
Office led by Christine uh Kaki. Thank
you so much for all of your hard work.

ice cream being scooped at the market on
the square in St. Mary's, Georgia. The
biscuits being buttered at Stefins and
Kingsland. The music being sung at
Captain Stands in Woodbmine and the pork
chops being served at Reeds Ponderosa in
Tarboro.
Camden County, you might be 249 years
old, but you are still beautiful as a
day my seatmate approved your charter.
Thank you.
>> Oh, he's over there. I see him now.

But I do want to wish her a happy 50th

Congratulations,

Representative Holly.
Y'all give the gentleman the whale your

recognized for an afternoon order.
Thank you. Uh
I said it fitting
if you love America
and you are proud to be an American. If
you love Georgia and are proud to be a
Georgian, will you please rise in honor
of our country and our state?
You don't have to, but it would be nice.
Unfortunately, we uh were not able to
honor uh this moment yesterday, but on
February 4th, uh our nation
saw uh the election
of a very first president of the United
States, George Washington, himself, not
only the commander-in-chief
for the Continental Army,
uh but is one who was able to at least
establish our nation as a response to
the people's will to stand against
tyranny for a system of government that
had no longer served them.
You will see pictured on the monitor to
his right is the 69th governor of
Georgia, Ellis Arnold, who you have
passed as you entered the capitol to see
his stout figure uh to the right of the
cap on Washington Street. Fortunately as
well on February of this actually this
day so many years ago towards the end of
World War II himself a proud Georgian
and one who appreciated seeing that all
were able to participate in fair
elections decided to abolish the pole
tax which unfortunately did not allow
for all Georgians to be able to fairly
elect someone to represent them. So on
this day, especially as we contemplate
taxes which are no longer serving the
people and systems no longer serving the
people, it's good to see that we can
honor two good Americans and thank you
for rising in honor of them today.
