TRANSCRIPT
----------
Anybody in the hall coming in, come on in.
All right boys quiet. I guess we'll go ahead and get started. People will start coming
on here. That way, that way you might not get as many questions, Commissioner. Come on
up, Commissioner Raven. I'm glad that y'all could come on early and help us move on a
little quicker. And we look forward to hearing what the Department of Natural Resources
needs. Lord, ears. Good afternoon and thank you for having me here today. Look forward
to discuss in our amended FY26 budget along with our FY27 budget for the Department of
Natural Resources. Let me begin before I get into my talking points to say how thankful
we are to Governor Kemp and Director Dunn for their continued support of the DNR mission
and our employees. And I look forward to working with all of you in the general assembly
and hope you can also be supportive of these efforts.
Before we get into the actual DNR budget,
I did want to give you a brief update on several items
that you funded last year and last year's budget.
I hear from many of you throughout the year
and everyone knows that Farrell Hoggs
continued to be a hot topic throughout the state.
Thanks to this body and the governor.
last year we created a new awards program that was funded and is being
administered by our Wildlife Resources Division. The name of this new program is
called the Hog Down Awards Program and what we have done is incentivized the
killing of feral hogs. We have a contest and we award five
five traps, Farrell Hogg, Sounder traps, each quarter.
So thus far, we have awarded 10 traps to date
and those applicants that have put in for those traps
have killed more than 4,000 hogs across the landscape
of Georgia, which is a very good thing.
And then along with this incentivized program
and the Farrell Hogg task force, we have removed
over 12,000 hogs from Georgia's landscape, which I hope that many of you will hear positive
comments from the ag community in your areas.
Additionally, I wanted to thank you for your continued support for the Hunters for the
Hungary program.
We are greatly appreciative of that.
This program has grown significantly with the funding that you have provided.
We now have 56 processors across the state that are participating, which covers about 52 counties.
99 food banks across our state have received that donated venison that our hunters have
harvested, which accounts for about 106,000 pounds of venison.
We are working towards our goal for the year of 140,000 pounds of venison for these food
banks. We hope to achieve that goal through the extended
bow season that is still going on in our Metro counties and
down in Southwest Georgia, but also through our crop
depredation damage permits. And while I'm on crop damage
permits, we can send you to receive and I will make sure
you hear me correctly. Great feedback with our program and
what we have done working with you here in your comments
and implementing those into how we issue crop damage permits.
Over the past year, we've issued over 900 crop damage permits
where we have authorized the killing of up to 31,000 deer
outside of our regulated deer season.
So we hear you, we hear your constituents
and are committed to continue to work toward that problem
while maintaining a healthy deer herd for our hunters.
Now moving on to the budget, what we're here to hear about.
DNR has several items in the Governor's Budget Report
for AFY26, and that begins on page 259.
We are very, very thankful for the $2,000 supplement
in the amended budget, which recognizes the importance
of recruitment and retention for the men and women
of the Department of Natural Resources
and are very appreciative of those dollars
that'll go toward that.
And you'll see that supplement reflected
in every one of our division's budgets.
Under coastal resources, item two,
is there is a $500,000 request to replace
our coastal resources database, which is over 20 years old.
this will help to streamline the permitting and application process all along the coast.
If you'll look on page 260 under parks recreation and historic sites,
item 2 is $1.25 million for erosion control at Cricket River State Park in Camden County.
If you ever visit the park, you'll see the enormous amount of erosion that has taken place
there since the 1960s. We've actually had to move our 11 cabins three different times
because the erosion continues to increase in crotch. So this request is to be used for the
state match for a $5 million grant that we have applied for to address that erosion problem.
Item 3 provides $500,000 in pass-through funding to the Stone Mount Memorial Association
for financial and operational review and planning.
On that same page under Wildlife Resources Item 2 provides $5 million for road paving
project on Saplow Island.
Item 3 provides $2 million in funding for land acquisitions that would expand our wildlife
management areas, provide outdoor recreational opportunities, and help to conserve our
endangered and threatened species statewide and then I'll end the amended
budget with several capital projects that can be found on page 381. Item 35
provides $1.75 million for the North Georgia Mountains Authority for
improvements and renovations at Unicoy State Park. Item 36 provides 10.4
$4 million for a helicopter, for our law enforcement division to support our search and rescue operations.
We currently have a fleet of three rotor wings.
We would sell one of those rotor wings to keep our fleet at three.
We want to replace one of our 407s with a 429, which is a twin engine helicopter and with
the increase of rescue missions that were flying in the Gorge, I think, if any of you
were in that helicopter during one of those rescue missions,
you would certainly want to back up engine.
Should we have a skiff or a fail?
Item 37 provides $3 million in funds
to support facility improvements and renovations
at our fish hatcheries.
Throughout the state, we currently have 10 fish hatcheries
and produce about 11 million fish annually
at those hatcheries.
Item 38 provides $1.5 million to replace gangways
at DNR operated properties throughout the state.
That money will be used to replace 67 gangways statewide.
Item 42 redirects $15 million out of our FY25 funds
that was authorized for land acquisition at Polling
in Dawson Forest to be used for land acquisitions
at Pine Log Mountain in Bartow County, probably
before it was left our inventory.
It's one of our most popular WMAs
and with the proximity to Atlanta.
It's a great investment for the state of Georgia
to conserve those properties so close by.
And then lastly, for the amended budget on page 384
undergo bonds issued, this allows us to utilize
the remaining proceeds from a bond
from fiscal year 23 that was used for vocal state park for dam repairs.
This will allow those monies to be used at other DNR maintained dams.
Any questions with the amended budget?
If not, I'll move on to FY 27.
We do have one question on the mended.
Okay.
Okay, moving on to FY27, which would begin on page 261.
Each of our division's budgets you'll see reflects the change in the adjustments to the
agency premiums for the DOAS administered insurance programs as well as the GTA telecommunications
and infrastructure rates and the state health benefit plan. Going to coastal resources,
item 4, page 261 eliminates the one-time funds that were used for beach restoration in the amount
of $1 million. This was passed through funding in our FY 26 budget. Under item five also with
our coastal resources it removes $75,000 in one-time funds for equipment and vehicle cost,
but we are retaining the personal services for those positions for the recreational
fishing data collection. Along those lines I've heard from many of you over the last couple
years about Georgia's red snapper fishery and as you know it's managed currently by the
federal government we have asked for a federal exempted fishing permit which would allow
the state to manage those fish off the Georgia coast.
We're very hopeful that we will get that exemption and these monies would be used to help
us gather that data so that we can provide numbers and manage that fishery as it should
be. If you look on page 262 under the Law Enforcement Division, item 2 provides funds to enhance
the retirement benefits for select post certified law enforcement officers. We're very appreciative
of the governor adding that and realizing the challenges of recruitment and retention
in law enforcement. On that same page under the Georgia Outdoor Stewardship Program,
items 1 and 2 show an increase in funds to this program.
Item 1 restores the 20% reduction that we saw in FY 26 due to the revenues decreasing
by 1%.
And then more than $5.7 million are restored to the trust fund in FY 27.
Additionally, in that program, if you'll look, item 2 shows a $4.9 million increase in
funds to the program which will reflect the increase from fiscal year 25
collections and that's the collections of sporting goods from sporting goods
stores and tax. Moving to the park's recreation and historic sites division on
page 262 item 3 eliminates $7 million that was one time funding for outdoor
Recreation. Again, these were pass-through funds from the FY26 budget. Item 4
eliminates $300,000 in one-time funds that was dedicated to the SAM shortline
railroad. If you'll look on page 263 under the Wildlife Resources Division. Item
4 shows an increase in funds of over a million dollars for the Wildlife and
diamond trust fund that makes that trust fund whole based off the number of lifetime
license that was sold during this past year and then lastly item five provides an increase
in funds to the amount of $200,000 for additional operational cost at fish hatcheries.
You heard me say that we produce about 11 million fish annually that we stock in all
of Georgia's waters and with the inflation you know that the price of fish food has
gone up tremendously.
You'll see a couple of bond projects in FY27 if you'll look on page 390, item 1 under
the Department of Natural Resources provides $4.94 million to fund replacement vehicles
and emergency equipment of these funds, $1.25 million will go to the gentleman that will
will speak after me and $3.69 million will remain in DNR to assist us with new vehicles
as well as seven aerial ignition drones that will support our fire efforts across the
state. Item 2 provides $16.91 million to fund facility major improvements in renovations
at DNR facilities statewide and again of that $16.91 million, $1.25, we'll go to the environmental
protection division and we would retain $15.66 million in DNR. And with that, Mr. Chairman
and members of this body, I want to thank you for your time today and I'm happy to answer
any questions.
Well, here are the good Chair, ladies, Smith.
Right in front of you.
Good afternoon.
First of all, I just want to do a shout out to what you and all the employees of DNR are
able to accomplish with a very small theme for the State of Georgia and also, too, as
you're listening, the DNR maintenance and care of our state makes us one of the most attractive
tourist spot in the country and another plan for Georgia outdoor stewardship
act. We've got it happening in Georgia and I appreciate you and all the
people who work for DNR and what you do. Thank you so much. We're very, very proud of
the system that we have provided and that's when I say we that includes
everyone in this room but the men and women of DNR work hard to make them look
good every day with very streamlined budgets. I'm proud to work there
accomplice.
Lucas.
I can hear you.
Let's not try that.
Let's try grabbing the person beside you if you got mine.
you by any chance has the problem by any chance looked at extending this season.
We have, we routinely look at those numbers and again what is a healthy population and
then you know we have a window that we can change the seasons in.
One thing we did this year that was very very popular increased our deer harvest state
wide was to add two do days prior to fire arm season coming in. So yes, we do look at
that almost on an annual basis. And we do have probably probably the most
liberal dear season of anywhere in the nation. Well, the reason I asked is
it's been kind of warm and going into wood and it's 75 degrees. They're doing
to be good, but would the deal still run all night long?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
You're not suggesting we stretch that to the dark hours?
Yes.
Representative Mathis.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. I just wanted to say thank you.
Had an excellent, on a big farmer down in my county.
a bear had totally obliterated a cotton module or a round bell that John did put that toward
all the pieces I want to know within two hours they had somebody over there trying to attack you
know catch the bear traffic that sort of thing and we were really impressed farmers and press I
was impressed I had the privilege of going over there what far from where I live and they were
appreciate it. So I want to say thank you to your folks in the field to y'all to get
the message out and come over because we've had several instances where the
BRD tariff caught my dude and as we were talking earlier we're trying to figure
out why they're getting into them we've got several theories but I just want
to say thank you thank you sir. Thank you sir that's simply
Thank you.
I appreciate that.
Mr. Lee, James.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I have three, I guess, lakes or waterways that you regulate.
Yes, ma'am.
The one for the Tadahoochi is right in South Olson, right at the Douglas County Line.
And we have to do a cleanup so many times that your department has somebody that comes
to clean up because we have a riding down the hooch, but it's just our key South Fulton
Beautiful.
We do a partner with many volunteer organizations, I know Director Kahn and the Environmental
Protection Division also sponsor a number of days throughout the year where we do help
with cleanup efforts.
We have so many, so much trash when we finish.
We have at least 10 people who have their own boats.
Somebody, I don't know whether they're getting approved
or what, but we have everybody to show up
and we have vendors to give us the orange jackets
and the grass and things.
So I just, they want to know if they can get something
from the natural resource that I told them
I would call them all right too.
We are happy to partner in the organizing of an event.
Yes, ma'am.
And the other one is Sweetwater Creek.
All of that is in my district in Douglas County.
And Roger Bruce just retired.
And he was in the house.
He was the house member for that.
And he had let's go fishing once a year.
And everybody wants to know what's
going to happen with it this year.
But he told me that I needed to talk to you
somebody in your department to see about putting fish in and how I could get
fishing rods for the little kids. We can certainly do that. Of course, he could come
out of retirement for a day to help us with that project. Yes, I hope he's listening.
And the last thing is a horrible thing that I was part of. I went to
Saplow Island for the annual family cultural day and I am glad that I had already
gone over to the other side because I could see from where I was that people about
30 people drank some people drowned but they fell off right after I had gone
of that rap with with my family too. So I wanted to know because they call me the other
day I want to know if they were going to get the insurance that can come through for
some of those people who die. And there are people from Sapporo Island and you know some
of their airs they don't they own little tiny houses. They want to know what natural resources
is going to do about pushing the insurance company
who is supposed to take care of those individual people.
And that's always going to give me the names,
and I would send it to the department.
That is still probably the most tragic day in DNR history,
and one of the most tragic days for the state of Georgia.
The investigation, believe this or not,
is still ongoing.
We're crossing every tea and dot and every eye
to make sure that we get it right.
So we're probably still a few months away
from the release of the final investigation.
But we will certainly keep this body updated
as that develops.
They did replace the ramp that failed.
But the thing is still wobbly, so I don't know who.
I tell people don't get on it.
Wow, it has been replaced.
It's being replaced again, and we're way over-engineering this.
Not that it wasn't engineered properly the first time,
but it's going to be very substantial.
Thank you.
So I can say you told me that.
OK.
Absolutely.
I'm going to do that too.
Thank you so much.
Yes, ma'am.
Chairman Yurden.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
appreciate you, Commissioner Beam here with us today and appreciate the job you're
agency does for the citizens of Georgia. The General Assembly has supported recent
efforts to improve game warden post certified employee compensation. Has this
had a result in improving folks interested in becoming game wardens and
enrolling in the training? Anything that we can do for any of our
employees is a but great service but just it has been a challenge not just for
DNR law enforcement I think Colonel Hitchens would say the same thing
director Hosey would say the same thing it's been very difficult to
recruit people to law enforcement in general and we are part of that we have
seen a slight uptick in the number of applicants we've had the last couple of
years our turnover rate has improved with what you have done and the governor
has done over the last several years.
But it continues to be a challenge
to recruit those people that will stick with us
for our career.
Thank you, sir.
Chairman Anderson.
Oh, boy.
Commissioner, just thank you for you and your staff.
It's a pleasure to work with you all.
I would like for you to give us all a little update
on how we help disabled people be able to get into the woods and go hunting.
Well, you have done that already, y'all.
I hope that everyone in here would say that you've heard of our outdoors beyond barriers
initiative and initiative that we took on two years ago.
Chip Madron was the brain child behind that who is a cancer survivor in a wheelchair.
With his idea, his vision, we've built upon that, we've got a statewide program now where
we're offering opportunities with any mobility impairments to get out in the woods and
do what we do day in and day out and enjoy that.
We've expanded that from deer hunting, we've had dove hunting, we've had some turkey hunting,
a number of fishing events across the state.
that program's just going to continue to build a super proud of the small staff that has
put that together. But again, all of you have supported those efforts in your local communities.
And if you have a contact in your communities and would like to see one of those events
come to your area, please reach out because we've gotten the tools. Now we're just trying
to get our message out to the people that can capitalize on this great initiative.
Chairman sayings.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And I want to preface this in thanking your department for working with our office with
this local input.
But I know as the revenue has increased in recent years, there's also been some local
concerns in terms of the department's larger land acquisitions and the changes that
does to local revenue, has there been any changes in terms of the local input process when
we're making large acquisitions and determining the appropriateness?
We do hear that.
You know, if you look at the DNR inventory across the state, I don't think that it's big
enough to adversely, greatly adversely affect, you know, tax incomes.
I would say to that is the economic impact that comes from hunters and anglers coming
in and staying in your hotels and motels and camping in our state parks should offset
any of the tax concerns with that.
But yes, that is something that we do follow closely.
We're not out there, happy, miserably, buying every piece of dirt that's for sale.
Again, those that have the greatest conservation value, those that we're able to manage efficiently
because they already join some of our properties or what really gets our attention.
Thank you Commissioner Arabin, that's all, that's all your questions, thank you.
Thank you.
Next up is Director Johnny Sabo with the Farns Street Commission.
How are you going to go?
I didn't have you down, sorry.
Go ahead. Go ahead. It's not the first time I've been forgotten, Mr. Chairman.
How could we forget you? Good afternoon, Chairman Hatchett,
Chairman Tillery. My name is Jeff Kahn. I'm the Director of the Environmental Protection Division of the Department of Natural Resource.
Thank you for this opportunity to speak with you all today, and I will be quick.
will be quick. But first off I wanted to say that I began working the environment of Georgia
in 1990 and I want to let everybody know today that our air, our land and our water are cleaner
and they continue to be clean. I attribute that to the EPD team and the partners. This
body here for given us the appropriate laws and tools to do our job and our dinner board
to set the policies for us and I'm really proud to be working on this for the last, this
this is about 36 years and that.
Now onto the budget.
I want to thank Governor Camp and Director Dunn
from OPB that have continued hard work on our budget.
This recommendation gives us the resources
and funding to succeed to the end of the fiscal year 26
and end of fiscal year 27.
Looking forward to work with you
in the Chairman and the General Assembly
as a whole as we go through this process.
As far as the amended FY26 is pretty short for us,
we have a little over 1.5 million for one time.
pays supplement of 2,000 to our full-time site employees.
And we really appreciate that being fully funded.
That helps us a lot, because we have a lot of fee funded
and federal fund of positions.
Then on our solid waste and trust,
and our has waste trust fund, there's no changes
in the mid-26.
Now I'll go into the full fiscal year 27 budget, which
will start in within the DNR budget.
On page 261, we have the normal statewide adjustments,
76,000 for DOAS insurance programs, reduction
of 8,800 to reflect adjustments for our telecommunications
and infrastructure for Georgia Technology Authority,
and also a reduction of over 1.1 million to reflect
and that reduction in the employer
of contribution rate of state health benefit plan.
Next on page 262, we have a true up to the hazardous waste
trust fund to align the budget
with fiscal year 25 collections,
which resulted in an increase of $3.1 million.
This is attributed to when the collections
of these funds come in.
Sometimes they come in a little before July 1,
sometimes a little after.
So we have to true it up at each session to keep it straight.
And then on page 266, we also have a true up
with the Solid Waste Trust Fund.
The new replacement tire fund is a true up with the 25
collections, the increase of 270,000.
Then on page 390, the commissioner sort of talked
about this.
The first is a capital expenditure for $1.25 million
to do some improvements to our Brunswick office.
We do a lot of work there at our Brunswick office.
The project will be in two phases.
The first phase will replace the metal panel roof,
and we'll add more offices to accommodate our water quality
team.
We're doing a lot of ambient water quality
and water on the coast.
And then in phase two, which will be requested in the future,
we'll focus on a shuttered boat storage, as well
as parking, grading, and pavement improvements.
Then next, far as replacement of our vehicles,
We got about 1.2 million, $80,000 will be to replace the aging air monitoring shelter at United Avenue monitoring site in Atlanta.
This is where we do our ambient air quality monitoring.
We have 25,000 for a backup air monitoring equipment at our South to cab monitoring site.
We have $510,000 to replace four pieces of laboratory equipment.
This equipment will support our drinking water analysis for water systems across the state as well as our water quality work.
And finally, we've got $565,000 to purchase and replace
12 vehicles that are eligible for BOS's replacement
through their methodology.
Chairman, thank you for your time,
and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.
Right now, you have one, Representative Buckner.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Here I am.
With the hazardous waste trust fund,
is there a list somewhere of the projects
that are funded with those funds that are brought
into the fund.
Yes, ma'am, it's all but has a side inventory facilities.
It's all our old leaking landfills and all,
but yes, ma'am, we can get you a list.
Okay, thank you.
I'll get you information on that.
That'd be great.
And then for the solid waste trust fund,
we use that to try to promote recycling,
and the idea behind that was to try not to fill up
our landfills so we don't have to cite anymore.
You don't have to do this, you know, but the capacity of our landfills compared to what
we're doing with recycling, I'd be interested in knowing if we're where we are with that.
So mainly our two things there is to clean up tires and promote, make sure that the enforcement
and permitting of tires carriers and car processors, tires, those operations are done in courts
with our rules and regs.
Also we have a lot of recycling grants that we're moving forward trying to create a help
create a circular economy in the state which will keep waste out of our landfills and
it will also help businesses start up in Georgia to recycle a lot of these materials.
So yes, ma'am.
Chair and Lynn Smith.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Right here in front of me.
So I want to back you up on what you said about improving our environment, land, air,
and water.
When I was first selected, the greater part of the Atlantic area was in the non-attainment
zone.
And no business, no industry, all of these things were on hold, and I'm taking years,
but y'all done a great job with that with not that many people now.
So thank you.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
It's our team that does all that great work with y'all's help.
Thank you.
Representative Glaze.
Thank you.
I wanted to ask if you guys have a list of municipalities who are no longer involved in recycling.
And the reason I asked that is there, I know that we have the grant money to help support and encourage that,
but it's there are some cities in my district who have moved away from recycling.
For me, that's a great concern.
concerned as much work as we've done to get a better
polity of water air and soil. We need to make sure that our
cities are continuing to join this state effort.
Yes, ma'am, our program that is headed by Leah Sassoni works to
do that, but we'll also work with the Georgia Municipal
Authority and the Association and County Commission of
Georgia to try to get the message out on this grant
opportunities and work with these local governments to help
them set up things that hopefully will help it continue
won't into the future, yes ma'am.
Would you be able to provide that to us so that we can get that to those municipalities
that we know have moved away from recycling?
Yes ma'am.
Thank you so kindly.
That's all the questions.
Director, thank you for being here this afternoon.
Thank you.
I will move to our next item.
Mr. Sabah from the Forestry Commission, Director.
I've got a PDF version, but did you want to plug in your PowerPoint?
Yeah, because I got a video, that's okay.
Sure, sure.
I'm about to point it out, it's sorry.
No, sorry.
I would copy it, though, because this thing, you would be poured out notice in that.
So, is it not?
Yes, sir, it is.
Glad you flew in the top to us.
I didn't quite fly in, but yes sir.
We'll talk about that too.
So good afternoon, Mr. Chairman.
Committee, thank you all for this opportunity to present today.
I'm going to run through a variety of things.
But the first thing that I want to do is recognize a few folks in the audience.
One is my deputy director, Mr. Chris Butler.
He's back here in the corner.
This CFO, Ms. Michelle Gray right here.
And then two gentlemen when I asked how do they want to be introduced?
Because they're pretty integral to something we're doing when they said just bow and Andy.
And I love that, so two of our five members from Georgia Tech back here, so if we get into
technical questions later on, I will absolutely defer to them.
I always like to remind everybody of our mission, vision, core values.
And really, this comes into play more now than ever, especially using facts to drive our decisions
and being responsible for our own success.
And I'm going to play into that a little bit, but especially when we start talking about
the force industry and how does Georgia climb out of the hole that we are currently in.
First a little update from last year and recovery efforts.
I appreciate the funding for tractors last year, so we have received five of the tractors
so far and 24 are expected within, within a month.
We are rapidly gaining that equipment in and we will be ready to go this spring season.
The fuel mitigation program, the 135 million, 132 of that was allocated for the cost share
program with landowners.
All of it is still allocated, so for $7.9 million paid and one thing that we did, if you
all noticed, we had a second sign up.
We called every single applicant, asked them where they are, did they plan on using the
funds, do they need help, what constraints do they have, and how can we help them.
And most of them said they plan on using the funds or waiting on cost share.
We had roughly 16 million turned back in from Landon or Sainte.
They were going to use EFRP, the federal program.
So that's where we did the second sign up with the 16 million to account for that.
And more than enough in reserve, if we have to do anything further, as far as landowners
wanting help.
As far as one neat product we did with that program is landowners said they wanted help,
but they couldn't find a contractor.
We then worked through the master logger program with UGA to find loggers who were looking
for work.
And all the log and equipment is not the best equipment in the world for debris cleanup.
You can do it.
And so we have loggers getting involved and helping clean up Palin just, you know, looks
It's a little bit different, but some of them are getting creative, but in rakes on
our front of their skaters and different things like that.
So, happy we could help find work for some of the loggers.
The fire breaks and forest road programs, we have finished with all the initial sign-ups.
We're still continuing to do that for free in the impact area.
Today, over 3,700 miles have line put in.
You see the hours, over 11,000 hours, and that is just in that immediate impact area,
really into the worst of the worst.
But that doesn't include all the other lines around the state and everything that we've
been doing.
All right.
I want to jump right into the governor's forgery task force before I kind of come back
to more traditional GFC ask.
I want to start with the mass timber building and I've heard a few questions about that and
the wood and the lie and I want to one thing to governor, I think he teed it up nicely
when we talk about building with mass timber in the state.
So when we look at nationally, you know, population densities are actually supposed to decrease
and go down, lumber, dimensional lumber, or it is tied to new starts.
When I say new starts, that's new construction.
So if we think new construction is going to go down what it has been, then how do we
find other uses for this wood to increase construction?
And mass timber is an outstanding answer for it.
There are some discrepancies in what cost are for mass timber to build mass timber.
I'll just be honest and it looks like some of the numbers are on average about 10% higher
to bill with mass timber.
But you're getting a superior product, carbon sequestration, natural resources where the
number one for sure is state in the nation and there's no reason that we shouldn't be
doing it.
The other thing it will do is if we start building with mass timber from an agency perspective,
GFC has 101 offices around the state.
We have 37 that need serious repair or rebuilding and I think about all of our other agency
partners, we're in prime position to attract a mass timber facility into
northeast Georgia where they have market access to Atlanta, Chattanooga,
Asheville, Greenville, all these cities that are utilizing mass timber. So then
we start finding another market in an avenue for our wood, but we have to start
somewhere. So that's my commitment here is we get this done, let GFC figure it
out, where can we find efficiencies building with mass timber within the state,
get the product we need, a product that's going to be around for 100 years, and then go forward.
The Georgia Grown Wood product, phase two, we're asking for a one-time six-hundred-sixteen-deam-ended
budget, and sorry I should say all these asking are in our AFY-26. Phase one at its heart was
content development. There's some meat on the bone and push out with it, but phase two really
starts working with economic development and others to how do we put our
self number one in the line for trying to attract industry. And if you think
about it, South Carolina lost markets a couple years ago, Alabama's lost
markets before that, Mississippi before them and Arkansas. So if you're
industry and you're looking to come in, your cost of wood is a that is a major
factor into when you're building industry, right? And if you're your input
cost are significantly cheaper somewhere else than why should they go
with our input cost are a little bit higher. Well, number one, number one, state
to do business, you know, we just need to show it off and show off our
infrastructure, our ports, and everything else that we have. And this Georgia
Greenwood project would allow us to do that. The last one, the one I'm really
most excited about, and I'm going to apologize because I'm actually just
going to read something straight, which I hate to do, but it is the Georgia
Forestry Innovation Initiative in partnership with Georgia Tech and I'll
set this up to say there's a lot of stuff that flies around and the forestry
task force took a deep dive into and one big one sustainable aviation fuel and
all these other markets. Well what's not widely known is that's pretty much
hamstrung by the renewable fuel standards at a federal level. I don't know if
you've tried to change anything at a federal level lately but it's pretty
tough and so we're looking for something what can we do with our small
diameter wood because that's what we lost with the paper mills. How do we use that product
and we make it sustainable and not just sustainable but profitable. It doesn't have to be subsidized.
We're not looking for rules or regulation. It's just good sound business. So the folks at Georgia
Tech have been doing a lot of work behind the scenes to get to where we are now and could not
thank them enough. But if you'll bear with me, I'm going to read this real quick. The Georgia
Forestry Innovation Initiative will enable forest industry expansion into manufacture of high value
of carbon, charcoal-related products,
solvents for automotive coatings and pharmaceuticals.
Be established by the Georgia Forestry Commission
and Georgia Tech, and we'll engineer, design, test,
and transfer these technologies
into concrete business activities.
The two-year economic impact could add up to 2 billion
to Georgia's GDP, and it will mature to grow up
to 80 billion supporting thousands of rural Georgia jobs
and utilizing roughly 12 million metric tons of wood.
Now I want to stop right here, because what we lost
when those mills close was about 8.2 million tons of wood
and 4 million tons in Georgia.
So if we get a third of this right,
we've replaced a market that we've lost in the state.
These projections are dependent on health investment
and piloting and technology to business transfer
and to help incentivize investment.
So they've done the research, they've done the studies,
they've done the lab work.
This is going from that tabletop to scale up
and moving forward beyond that.
There's multiple force industries that's
interested in this project.
There's a lot of visionaries out there,
but there's still some risks.
So that's what this is helping the state take
a little bit of that risk away.
And to me, 10.9 is not a huge ask
when we think about a 2 billion GDP return in a couple of years.
And if we want to go more depth on that one
on the what and how, that's where I will absolutely
get my friends from Georgia Tech up here.
Keep it on AFY 26.
Walter left the room talking about helicopters this is the helicopter that you
appropriated last year I want to thank you for that it is in Virginia we should
take ownership of it next what we were planning on this week but the you know
the weather nice stormer like why don't you leave it up there under shelter
before we even bring it down here it's gonna be a little bit different
anything we've ever had if you see this the snorkel dangling down below it will
actually fly over suck up water has greater care and capacity and we're very
excited about what this will bring and what this will mean to our fleet.
Just in case anybody has the questions, no, it's not there all the time.
It kind of tucks up in and out the way.
Just really want to thank the governor for the Employee Supplement Fund, that is massive
when we talk about turnover and employee morale and what that means for our agency.
107,000 operational funds for the new helicopter.
You'll see the full amount in FY27, but that's essentially the last quarter to cover the
full amount when we think about fuel maintenance and everything else when we have an addition
to fleet.
10.9 for the Georgia Forestry Innovation Initiative.
That's what we just talked about with Georgia Tech and 148,000 in the past refunding to
Tablet County.
As far as capital outlay, 2.6 for mass timber that we just went over, and then 12 million
for tractor replacement, and I want to touch on that one a little bit, and I'm going to
show the importance of why here later, but last year we were asking for 10.9 in the amended
and we had 1.1 in our actual operating budget. This year that 1.1 is going to be shifted
and we'll show that and so we won't have the full 12 million if you will go and forward.
So the 12 million is actually going to be an amended budget as we move, but that 1.1
we really need for operational funds. So when we get into the FY27 budget, when you
you see that 1.01 in operating funds.
That's what we had for equipment replacement.
Now it's being taken out of that
and moved to operational funds.
On average, our average fire response now
is costing us $480 more per fire.
So when we talk about 4,000 wildfires in a year,
it's just taking more to attack the fire.
Fuel goes up.
I don't have to tell you all inflation is going up,
but honestly, it's just more people and more manpower,
especially in the impact area.
428,000 for the helicopter.
That's what we just talked about, 107 in the amended for the last quarter, and that
will help with operational funds in our aviation fleet as well.
Full support for the 2.4,000 and a poster to five law enforcement officers, many folks
aren't aware, but GFC actually has law enforcement officers in.
We do arts investigation, timber theft, partner with Fire Marshall's office, DNR, and we
We actually arrested one arsonist this past week and we're on one another and another
one this week and I won't get too much deeper than that but they do a lot of good work
and a lot of times they go and notice and to me that just means they're doing their job
and it's couldn't think that group enough.
Capital 1.7 for light duty vehicles so that's everything from engines to transport support
to trackers, chief ranger trucks, things like that, 1.6 for major maintenance and repair
and then little over a million for new construction,
for a truck shed and coffee counting.
And of course, this was all done before,
the kind of mass timber movement when we put this in here,
but of course we're gonna look to do that
with mass timber as well, so that is the absolute goal.
And I would like to pause for a second
to point this picture out.
If you'll look at that picture,
it doesn't really look like Georgia,
but it's a pretty neat moment.
We had 12 boys and girls from this state fly up to Alaska,
and they handed them the number one priority fire in the nation,
which means it could not be ripping any more,
could not be doing any more damage,
and they've turned it over to a bunch of people
from Georgia up in Alaska,
and could not be more proud of them for two weeks,
not gonna say they stopped the fire,
not when their conditions like that,
but no one was hurt and no homes lost
and protected everything, everything critical to the state.
So, really proud of our team for what they did.
Moving in just kind of a wildfire outlook,
and I know this feels a little weird,
seeing as we're bracing for an ice storm,
But it's there and it's real.
So the governor mentioned over 4,000 wildfires, 26,000 acres.
We have seen an increase in wildfires.
And it's cyclical, and now we have a lot of fuel loading
from Helene, which we talked about last year.
This fiscal year, when we looked at just this fiscal year
and set a calendar year, so far, we're halfway
to that 4,000 again.
So we're still tracking for a high year.
And the one number I did want to throw out in some of y'all
in this room may not like that as I'm looking at center
Goodman. Um, as we talk about Okie Finokie Swamp and when we talk about using
data and facts to drive our decisions, I'm not saying this is going to happen. I
hope it doesn't happen. I really hope I'm wrong. But that 52 inches annual
precipitation is pretty important down there. So when we go back to 2006, we only
had 40 inches. 2007 was a terrible year. 2010. We got 36 inches. 2011 was a
a terrible year. 16, 47 inches. We know what 17 was and so far in 25 we've had 41
inches. So that swamp is really dry. Everything surrounding the swamp is dry. Our whole
southeast corner right now it's just a tender box. So this rain we're getting is not
going to mitigate that. It's going to give us about a week off at most to kind
of rehab our equipment and get ready to go again. Kind of proved my point when
fire is going like this at night. These are all within the last couple weeks. That
not a good time. Usually night humidity comes up, Wednesday down and we're able to catch it.
When you see pictures like on your, where's it? Your bottom left here and it's spot
down or front of itself in the middle of the night, that's not fun. So those are the kind of
conditions that we're facing right now and quite honestly the lines that we've pre-established
have been a big help, roads and we're just going to continue to be aggressive on putting in lines,
pre-establishing lines, work with landowners and be aggressive to the scene as soon as we get
it called. And wanted to play this for you. We're leaning more and more into technology.
So we had a big swamp fire in Ackison County. Could not access it. Could not get into it.
And so we utilize a drone to light it off in the middle and then light the edges to where
it starts burning coming together. And I thought you all may appreciate this one. It's a quick
30 second clip. So it's hard to see, but the drones drop in what we call dragon eggs. And
this Dragon Age will eventually line on fire.
And then when it starts burning to come together,
the interesting part was the landowner told us,
his whole life, he's never seen that swamp dry
and it's dry right now.
So it's just, yeah, once again, sorry,
using that in fact to drive our decisions
and then just a wildfire outlook.
So we'll continue to be prepared for ice storms,
wildfires, whatever it is, but I could not think,
this community, this body enough for the support
you've given us, because without you and without your support, we would really be ineffective
in doing our job, so it is critical.
And thank you and happy to take any questions.
Chairman Carter.
Thank you.
Just outside my pay grade, obviously, but I know that there are some folks that are taking
wood pellets and shipping them over to Europe and making power with them.
And my question is, how far off are we from an economic standpoint, for being able to
to do that in a state that's clearly hungry for power.
Has there been anybody talking about that
or is environmental regulations too much for it to work?
Yes, I won't say the regulations are too much.
There's a lot of conversation on that,
no matter if I was with the speaker before I came in here
and we were having that same conversation
about moving forward.
So there's a lot of conversation revolving around that,
but at the end of the day, it's got to work
in the right place and the numbers have to work too.
So that's, I wanna say that's the driving factor.
Some of that starts, I'll be honest with you,
I went to school to grow trees and like things on fire,
so it starts to get over me just a little bit,
but it's really more about,
is that the most efficient use as far as the electricity
and everything else, and in some cases,
it probably is, and so we're diving deep into that.
Yeah, I mean, I just think there's a lot of people
talking about coming in to backfill overflows
and selling it at a premium.
And if you could sell it at a premium,
then the math might work.
So, anyway, appreciate you.
Yes, sir, thank you.
Chair, we do.
Good.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I just want to thank you.
How long had you been over the Forest Commission
when the hurricane hit?
10 days.
10 days.
And I just want to tell you all,
I mean, the work that your agency did,
getting out and chainsaw crews and clearing up roads and really the work that
y'all do every day but also the work that you've done with me and others in
the legislature and helping craft legislation. I mean your service on this
task force you know two-thirds of the states covered in Timberland and so
anybody that doesn't think that what happens in the forestry industry doesn't
affect all of Georgia I promise you that you know that it does and really
There's something that I've talked to you about before I'm going to bring it up, but y'all now where I live at
I live it's 11 miles to the closest place to buy gas and
You all are really the last line of defense and that's the reason everything we got and y'all fought
4,000 nearly 4,100 fires, right? Yes, sir and we're talking about the swamp. I remember in 2007
I was on that fire and it was two o'clock in the morning and I wish everybody in this room could be there to experience
That's what he's talking about because the humidity gets real low and the fire spot in
three miles ahead of you and it literally sounds like a freight train and it's creating
its own weather and it's sucking so much oxygen feeding the fire that when you stand on
a dirt road it's like a sandblaster on your face because that fire is pulling oxygen
so fast.
And I remember Buck Lyne who's retired now but he was over lands in the near chief
Ranger, two o'clock in the morning, he strikes out, he fits a thing around his face where
he can breathe, if you can't breathe.
And he and about 20 other tractors went off into the woods, you know, and I'm just
remembering praying God help him get back, you know.
And so one of the things that before I leave this building, that I hope that he get done
and I'm speaking for me now, not for you, but I'm speaking for me, 4,100 fires.
guys that are fighting these fire y'all are heroes and they cannot participate in the state fire
fire suspension and that is something that I hope that everybody in this room before I go back
to Cobbdale and hang it up or the folks and staffs will just send me home that that we can do
that because those folks deserve it and I just honestly thank you for being my friend but you
really I'm you've done a great job and you were thrown into the fire and I'm proud of you
I'm proud of your agency.
Thank you, Senator.
I couldn't thank you enough for your support
and everybody's supporting.
It's a great team.
It's not just me, outstanding team.
So, yes, sir.
Chairman Tarman.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I will echo what Senator Goodman said as he made over
marks. I had the chill bumps on arms,
from experiences I've had when I was a child.
Director, every year when he made the drops and the wind picks up and you look out and
see all the places that are grown up and I think of you and your predecessors.
The questions I've got is one for employee safety and the other for logistics.
Over the years this is what I think I've ever, ever followed when we get into this season.
the cab tractor situation as far as percentages elaborate a little bit on if our percentages
of course are picking up I'm sure they are and the logistics problem we had years ago was
some of the heavy equipment been able to get it moved around the state properly aren't we
are we pretty much stocked up in regions at least before we can move the larger equipment
and again thank you for what you guys do yet yes sir thank you for the comments so I'll start
start with the logistics question and moving around the state, that is absolutely
solved and a lot of that sometimes depends on the personnel to move the
equipment, right? And I could not be more proud to say that our turnover rate, if
I take out retirements because in my mind, you know, you do 30 plus years, you
deserve to retire, work 3.2%. So that really helps solve that logistics problem of
moving equipment, getting it around the state pretty quick. Even with retirements
So we're not talking about a huge jump.
As far as open cab tractors, we didn't work with OPB for several years to put a plane in place.
There's 12 million that were asked for and amended as part of that plan.
We replaced roughly a third that we had left, before last year we had 100.
So we replaced roughly a third of those two more shots of 12 million.
We'll take care of all of our open cab tractors.
and then the goal is to bump it back down to like a six or seven million a year
and that'll put us on a 20 year replacement cycle. So that's the that's the
vision. Yes sir. Thank you. Chairman Peter. Thank you Mr. Chairman and thank you
director. You don't know how much I appreciate all y'all do. Those guys in
Stapleton do a marvelous job. Brandon Davis and all those guys. Y'all do great work.
I wanted to ask you, you mentioned, we can't do enough for you guys, first of all, in my opinion,
two-thirds of the states in Standing Timber, and a lot of people don't realize that, and
you're going to lot to do.
But you mentioned the 8.2 million tons of what we've lost in Georgia.
That's huge loss of demand.
To what degree, an issue we're working on, a transferability of tax credits, job tax
credits, investment tax credits, in your opinion, to what degree would that be helpful for
us to get?
You mentioned Mass.
Timber, biofuel was mentioned by the chairman up on the podium there.
So tell us, tell me what your thoughts are on transferability of tax credits.
Well, I go right back to, we're in competition with other states and there's a lot of fine
people in some of those surrounding states.
And so we're at the back of the line because we started last and somehow we got to get
to the front of the line.
And so anything that we can utilize to attract industry
to this state, to either attract industry,
and if it uses a load of wood, it's good.
That's kind of our motto.
So, that's true.
All right, this fourth line over here,
you don't need to get together.
Chairman Smith, Chair Lady.
Thank you, right, and frame me.
Look, dammit.
So, first of all, to the people who are listening,
do not live out in rural areas where there's farming. Georgia, and with the help of Georgia
Tech and some other groups, we were the first state in the nation to do carbon credits.
And the innovation and blindness to stick your head up and look around to keep advancing
this forward has been a great benefit to Georgia. I think city dwellers need to see what
Mass timber actually looks like it's not something they readily identify with but it's safe as any other product used to
construction but overall and to all of our presenters this afternoon
that we ask these agencies to do a whole lot with little resources and so I greatly appreciate what you did.
Thank you. Chairman Yurna. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Director. Appreciate that code.
What everybody else said about the job y'all do
for the state of Georgia.
Oh, and I love the aspects of
mass timber and what the
possibilities are there.
Do you have an eye?
How many in the United States
have any manufactures of
mass timber are there?
I will have to get that answer back to you for the United States.
But I do know if we want to use southern yellow pine,
there's one that we use in that smart lamb and dofen.
with them. So, very good. Thank you.
Representative Mathis.
Director, I appreciate you very much.
Yes, sir. I want to throw out one little thing here about
Arrowhead seed orchard. A lot of people don't know what that does in the state of Georgia
when they go up and they pollinate these trees, they graft trees, they've increased from
30 years down to about 12 years or 10 years on growth on fulcwood. It's amazing what
they do and how they do it and how they catalog it. I know they work with DNR
confined up there on the land that we have there. It's part and
flasky part and blackly. My senator Walker here, he's part of that. And I
also just to listen to the North Carolina state people that are involved in
that and how they graph these trees, it is unbelievable. And I wouldn't
encourage anybody in the timber business anything that grows timber to come
down and watch them when they bagged the trees and they pollinate certain things to get a certain
treat. I was amazed and I believe they're my whole life and I didn't know they did what they do
up there until I got in the legislature and was invited to go up and see that. But I do thank you
for some of the equipment improvements that you've given us over there, the tree shaker. They have
to shake all those cones to get down and I know it would wear out a few... Not a fun ride, is it?
Yeah, since from 1976 the same tree shaker, so that was a video, but there are a few more needs down there
And I'll talk to you on the side about that and I appreciate it, but I do encourage anybody
I'm very happy you brought that up. So I'm proud to say right here for everybody that my
Team was ahead of me and there's two that will be there in March
Thank you very much
Thank you. I was going to mention that you had come in and just in a minute you were
faced with a hurricane and then you were faced with the mill closures and you've been faced
with the residual from the storm which is a fire hazard or opportunity that will have
to face in the next few weeks. And I guess this is going to feel like well what do you
you won't for me now, but there's a lot of the state of Georgia that don't understand
how important forestry is to the entire state.
We've said several and said that.
There used to be a line item in the budget for the commission for education, particularly
in the schools.
And I remember when it was cut drastically, is there any money left in your budget anymore
for education in our public in our school systems to the youth about the
importance of far. We do I mean to your pointers on a line item we have one
dedicated designated person that that is their full-time job works with project
learning trees schools sits on multiple committees and then develops materials
and handouts that we did in train our county units our chief rangers forsters
and gives them you know fresh new products year in a year out that we'll find
federal grants for to then implement in classrooms.
Um, so I'm glad to hear that because I think we did need to keep people informed.
And all we have to do is offer smokey and they take us in every time.
So that's, yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you for all you've done.
This man's list.
I'm sorry.
I know you're trying to rush and I'll be quiet.
But we've had so many people upset about the mill closures and I've gotten so many calls
and I usually call him immediately after they call me so I can share the pain.
He's been very gracious.
Thank you.
Director, thank you a lot.
Also, just a parting comment on a reminder
that Representative Jordan Ridley is certified
in wildfire management and fighting fire.
So if you need him, he said he'd volunteer back there.
That is good to know.
We'll put him in work.
Take him on crossover day, that'll help us with the fight.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Next up is Commissioner Nguyen.
And they were done.
Ah.
Just kidding.
We're going to hear from Director Nguyen.
All right.
You're going to use that twice, right?
Commissioner Nguyen.
Thank you so much and I know that I'm the 40th of your presenters over the last couple of days
I started to bring some milk and bread for y'all because I know you've been sequestered away
But I think there's still plenty there
Chairman members of the Appropriations Committees. I'm Christopher Nunn Commissioner of the Department of Community Affairs
And I'm delighted to be here with you today to give you a little bit of an update and share our budget. I will be
Do my best to be brief and to the point
A quick reminder, DCA is the state's community development agency.
We support community planning and economic development, infrastructure, financing and housing.
We focus on helping build strong, vibrant communities, which, as you know, includes access
to affordable housing.
As one of 53 state and territory housing finance agencies, DCA effectively delivers solutions
for home ownership and safe affordable housing.
So I'm going to work off of your sheet.
I don't have a presentation.
In section 16 of your budget documents,
you will find a handful of agency recommendations.
And I want to first start by thanking Governor Kemp
and the legislature for your support for our state employees.
When I left the private sector, I didn't really
have a clear idea of what to expect.
But I have had the pleasure of working
with some of the most talented and dedicated employees
individuals and state government. And of course, I'm biased to DCA, but I will tell you
that extends beyond DCA to all of the agencies across the state, director Sabo, enjoy partnering
with him, Rick Dunn, who will be up here after me. I really appreciate the talent that
we get to work with, and I thank you for recognizing the hard work of these professionals.
While important and impactful, our work can be thankless at times, and I appreciate
your full consideration of the proposed one-time supplement that's reflected
throughout the budget. Under at line 703, under housing initiatives, you will
note a $50 million proposed one-time funds to the State Housing Trust Fund to
address homelessness across the state. So it is our intent to roll out a
flexible competitive grant program with these funds, and I'll just break this down into
three basic things. First, you've heard me share a 2020 GAO study that shows a strong
link between rent and homelessness, specifically a resulting 9% increase in homelessness for
for every $100 increase in median rent.
In fact, homelessness is a complex issue
and it affects urban and rural areas alike.
With these funds, it is our intent
to focus on the issues of unsheltered homelessness.
So the unsheltered population is on our streets.
Second, we recognize that while $50 million
a lot of money. At the same time when you consider the housing needs statewide, it's not that much.
And so in order to stretch these funds even further, we do expect for these competitive
applications to include matching funds. I've already had conversations with a number
of philanthropic providers and with communities. Solutions to homelessness are best defined
at the local level. This initiative is aimed to support locally driven initiatives by providing
flexible funds that are leveraged by local and philanthropic matching funds, thus stretching
the $50 million even further. And finally, while solutions in Atlanta and Savannah may look
different from those in Gainesville, Tifton, or Statesboro, we do plan to require all grant
recipients to provide us with the data so that we'll have a better grasp of the scale of this
important issue statewide. I'm sure there are questions, but I'm going to continue through
Chairman with the budget. Under at line 717, I must say with the George Environmental
finance authority I hated to see my friend and colleague Hunter Hill leave in
November but I'm excited to be working alongside Trey Bennett who is the new
executive director at Jeefa and I expect that you will hear from him in the
subcommittee hearings. At line 717 you will see the proposed edition of
$35 million. Last session Senate Bill 13 expanded Jeefa's
responsibilities to include project financing for natural gas facilities. This
This amount simply provides startup capital for such projects.
Moving to one Georgia, in its first 25 years, one Georgia has made significant impact
all across the state, especially in our more rural communities.
That work continued in 2025, with $12.5 million awarded to 11 communities for industrial
capacity and recruitment.
The recruitment activities entailed 3,067 jobs in places like Cedar Town, Metter, Midway,
and Warnton.
In addition, workforce housing and site development initiatives continue to address important
community needs.
Last year, we extended 11 workforce housing infrastructure grants in Kero, Carrollton,
Douglas Coffee County, Gilmer County, Greensboro,
Hagen, Lee'sboro, Moultrie, Richmond County,
Swainsboro, and Tomiston.
And the pipeline in that program remains strong.
At line 725, this relates to an FY26 legislative
ad for disaster recovery.
You appropriated $25 million to assist communities
affected by Hurricane Helene.
and we stood up in one Georgia, a new program,
and conducted two grant cycles,
providing assistance to 17 communities,
in Appling, Bullock, Glenn, Hancock,
Irwin Jeff Davis, Jefferson, Lawrence Lincoln,
Lowns McDuffy, Richmond,
Scriven, Tiff, Tooms and Wilkes counties.
This proposed reduction in the budget reflects
all of those remaining funds,
which we recommend moving to Ag and Forestry budgets
as you just heard from Director Sabo
to address ongoing timber-related disaster needs.
Also on line 726,
the governor recommends an additional $15 million
for a successful site development initiative
that was launched 18 months ago.
The impetus for this initiative is the demand
after successful deployments of sites
have been developed in conjunction with one Georgia over its first 25 years. These small
to mid-sized industrial tracks enable local leaders to grow their local economies. However,
many have been deployed amid unprecedented statewide success over the last five years.
So since 2024, one Georgia has awarded 11 site development infrastructure grants
to grad sites, that's Georgia Ready for Accelerated Development, to grad sites in Baldwin, Bullock,
Camden Dodge, Glenn Lawrence, Liberty, Houston Peach, Screven, Tooms and Worth Counties.
There are an additional 11 scholarships or smaller planning grants that have been extended
to other communities that are seeking the Department of Economic Development's grad certification.
We anticipate that many of those planning grants will lead to infrastructure funding requests,
which is the objective behind this addition.
Shifting to the FY27 budget document, there are a couple of items beyond the standard enterprise
adjustments throughout. At line 802 under Departmental Administration is a 2.8 million dollar increase
to address partial funding for prior year cost of living adjustments. I've heard other agencies
highlight the fact that reimbursement of federal funds might take years. As the administrator
of block grants, there are no additional federal funds to offset DCA's agency cost increases.
We are not seeking full funding for the increased agency cost, however we do ask your support
for this increase to address the impact on our home ownership program.
Many of you are familiar with the highly successful Georgia Dream Program.
This program, which is funded by Morty Drevenue Bonds, relies on proceeds to finance
down payment assistance.
Last year, Georgia Dream supported a record number of first time home buyers, 3,035, to
be precise all across the state.
And a significant portion of the agency's cost of living, cost increases are borne by
the housing finance agency with funds that might otherwise be used for down payment
assistance, which is needed to sustain the increased home ownership production.
Under housing initiatives at line 820, this is a simple, this simply reflects the reduction
of $2 million to the State Housing Trust Fund, which you included in last year's budget
with the explicit note that those were one-time funds, and so we are making those one-time
and also at line 836 under GFA, similarly a $500,000 reduction, which I understand was
included in the 26th budget for a specific project, but also was reflected by this
body as one time funds. With that, Mr. Chairman, that concludes my quick
presentation and I'm happy to entertain questions. Thank you, Commissioner.
There's an individual that has their button pressed. She missed the DNR
presentation and I think they said they would take their building in Taylor
county, but I'll let represent it. I'll have to represent it. Ask a question, maybe.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and good afternoon, Commissioner. Thank you for your
presentation. And he's right. I do have an empty field that's owned by the
state in Taylor County that if Department of Corrections,
community affairs will love you to take it on if you feel that you need some
additional space. But also, just to let you know, I wrote a letter of support from
Macon County for the CHIP grant. So if you see my name come across, I'm
supporting Macon County for that endeavor. But you mentioned in your
presentation that you are the administrator of the block grants. So as
the administrator for the block grants, is it required for local governments
that are applying for block grants through Department of Community Affairs to
to have public hearings to notify the public of their intent to apply for a block grant.
And if so, can you explain that process to me?
So absolutely.
And I'll kind of tie your question together.
So you mentioned a really important program, the CHIP program, community housing initiatives.
That's funded with federal block grants.
So the state receives that block grant.
And we sub-grant that to communities who are in fact required to do public hearings as
a part of the application process for those competitive funds.
So the state is the block grant recipient and those funds are granted to communities.
I hope you're successful in the application.
I know that that program is fantastic and it contributes to the construction and rehabilitation
of homes and communities across the state.
And so yes, the public hearing is a requirement
for that process.
Those are federal grants.
But again, there's an available building in Taylor County.
Thank you very much.
There's another carpenter.
Thank you.
Appreciate you being here, sir.
Quick question.
First question is on the under, I didn't realize this,
but under the building construction line item,
you guys set building construction codes for the whole state.
Is there a possibility that we get a group of people
that do a lot of building in our communities
that complain about certain codes that are excess
that are driving the cost of housing up
to sit on some sort of panel to discuss these things
instead of just carte blanche
accepting international codes.
Yeah, no, that's a fantastic question.
And I honestly would appreciate any of you
have questions about this process to come and see me
because I think this is a very misunderstood process.
So in fact, you created a process for creating
state minimum codes.
It's the minimum code.
And that is done by a subcommittee of the DCA board
that is made up of 21 defined professions in the law.
So it is the HVAC industry,
it is the electrical industry,
it is the building officials, it is the fire marshals.
So it is 21 qualified professionals,
including home builders, who sit on that panel.
And every six years, so the international codes
come out every three years, but so that we are a predictable state in which to do business.
We do every six years, we revisit the latest international code and adapt that to Georgia.
And it is that group of professionals from the industries, from communities across the
state, local officials are represented by local building officials and by local fire
marshals, you know, each of the industries, it's a very thorough process. I don't know
that I have ever seen the international codes adopted carte blanche, right? We are always
working and cost, you know, is absolutely one of the criteria that they look that they
look at as they go through that debate. So I'd love to talk to you more and share with
you more about how that process works. But to be clear, that's not a handful of agency
people at DCA, defining the same minimum codes, that is a group of industry professionals
that were defined by this box.
Sure, maybe even just like a friendly suggestion box or something.
The other piece is, of course, on the homelessness piece.
I heard what you said.
I just hope that there sometimes it can be a much more cost-efficient to catch it before
it happens from stretching those dollars.
So hopefully as we move through this process we can have that conversation.
Representative Glees.
Thank you, Chairman.
So Commissioner Nunn, I was wondering if the Georgia Initiative for Community Housing
is going to play a part in helping with those homeless dollars in trying to get more
inventory on the market.
And the reason I asked that, there is a lot of municipal,
what we call barriers to developers actually coming in
and building out more of what we need.
And so some of that is around just going through the process
of planning and making sure that their streamlining,
streamlining some of those local processes,
is there a way to put that into the Git program
or the homelessness program that grant money
to make sure that developers are not being hamstrung
in the municipal process for getting, you know,
from the dirt to a key to a door.
Right, so great question, and short answer is yes and no.
So, but thank you for highlighting
the Georgia Initiative for Community Housing,
which I think is a fantastic long-term planning program.
And the way that I think that the answer is yes,
is over the last 20 years,
we've had nearly a hundred communities across the state
that have participated in the GIC program.
Worst acronym in state government, right?
Remember, pay attention when you come up with an acronym
in your law, because it's just gonna get a job.
And so I think when you look at those communities,
Many of them, for years going forward,
continue to maintain that team
to address community housing issues.
And I think in those communities,
absolutely, they can play a big part
in how do we address homeless needs
in a particular community.
I think because that program is a planning program,
so the people who come into the program this year
are participating in a three-year process
And I don't expect that anyone in this room
would consider appropriating funds to an agency
that you want us to deploy four years from now.
And so I think that the way that the GIC participants will
play a role in addressing these homeless issues
is that alumni community that is participated in the program
over the last 20 years, or maybe in the program today.
That's exactly the program that's on the other side of the ones we need to be talking to to make sure that they help us with these barriers
We we get this every day our developers are telling that we cannot get
You know houses on the market because local governments are literally
Causing us not to be able to get there in an efficient and and financially sound
manner so we need help and I think the state can give you know some kind of
assurance that we're making sure that those who come through the get program have
this information and we give them some information to help them streamline the
process. If they're going to get the grants and we're going to get the
housing on the market that we need so that we don't deal with homelessness at
is right. We've got to get everybody in the game and they've got to participate.
Thank you so much.
Representative William.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Commissioner, I always appreciate working with you. I just
to stay in homelessness for a second, I appreciate the focus on unsheltered homelessness.
To bridge that with what Chairman Carpenter said, we also know that a lot of the issues with that
is people who are sheltered, at least by the HUD definition, become unsheltered and are not
accurately captured by the periodic point in time counts. And I'm wondering, and we know a lot
of local struggle with that, is there any guidance that will be given even some funds directed
to addressing that? Because I think that bridges the gap between unsheltered and sheltered.
So, I will just highlight to you policy makers, you know, we laid out a rough idea of a plan
that was included in the governor's budget.
$50 million is not going to solve all housing issues in the state.
And in conversations with some of the philanthropic partners that we have talked to, focus
is important. I know, and you remember, we administered a billion dollars in emergency
rental assistance during COVID, which that's 20 times, this 50 million. And so we are certainly
open to that feedback and to tweaking this program, which is simply a concept at this
stage to address the needs in our communities. I mean, that's really what I meant when I said
The intent is a flexible program that meets local needs.
We really do believe that the solutions in Rome
are probably going to look different than they look
into COA or in Atlanta.
You don't have a question?
OK, sorry.
Your light was on, but maybe not.
Maybe it was Senator Eccles.
Oh, guy, you hit the one mind.
You never mind.
It's perfectly fine.
Commissioner, thank you, John.
And two things I want to bring up
for just some committee purposes.
One, we'd love to know the rules,
what you're looking at for this housing program.
We're obviously very lazy of what we saw happen
in Minnesota, one of kind of have some ideas
of what our guardrails will be.
And then also, what is the total announced matching funds
you think are coming from other agencies
or other places that will be there?
If you know that already, feel free to share
if you need to bring it later on, that's fine.
I don't, we would expect that
as a part of the application process.
So, and I think that that probably looks different.
I just say this because not everybody will be in subcommittee.
I think that looks very different in a community like our capital city
than it would in Tipton.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Thank you for the variety of hats you wear.
Our next and final presenter, we move from none to done.
Director Dunn.
There you go. Shall we say the best for last?
Probably. We do have the block hearing grant.
Block grant hearings at four, so just so you don't know that.
And even though we're finishing early, please know because of federal law,
we will still have to wait until four o'clock to hold that hearing.
So we will not be able to accelerate that one.
I've got an hour of video that explains the budget process at OPP, if you don't mind
me.
No.
Chairman Tillery, Chairman Hatchett, members of the Appropriations Committees, I appreciate
Once again, being able to join you this afternoon to wrap up your budget week.
Last week, the governor released his budget recommendations for AFY 2026 and FY27.
This week, you were able to hear directly from the governor on his budgetary priorities.
Our state economists on the revenue estimate and the state of the economy.
And from our executive and judicial branch leaders on their agency needs and specific
budgetary items contained in the governor's recommendation.
Our task here today is to attempt to summarize and wrap up this testimony before you, before
you head into your subcommittee work and putting the stamp of the General Assembly on the
final budget.
Let me start off with revenue performance.
We ended last year FY25 with general revenue up 1.48 billion dollars or 4% higher than
the AFLY 25 budget revenue estimate.
For the first six months of this fiscal year, general fund revenue is up 1.6 percent
over the same period last year.
This is not great, but these are decent results, especially if you keep in mind that the
first six months of this year includes a 20 basis point lower tax rate in the same period
last year.
The current FY26 budget passed last year is built upon assumed general fund revenue
of $35.9 billion, which is 1.3 billion or 3.4% less than FY25 actuals.
My point here is that revenue performance today, as well as our previous cautious budgeting,
will allow for additional tax reductions in 2026 and allow for expenditure growth in the
FY26 and FY27 budgets over the current base.
So for this year's budget revenue estimates for AFY26, General Fund revenue available
for appropriation is set at 2.3% growth or $822 million above the current FY26 base.
This is 1.2% less than FY25 actuals.
In addition, we are releasing $372 million from the RSR for K-12 adjustments and $3.3 billion
from the undesignated surplus.
That makes the total amount of general funds available for expenditure in AFY26 of $40.4
billion are an increase of $4.5 billion, that's 12.5% over the FY26 base.
For FY27, General Fund revenue forecasted to be up 1.8% or $662 million over the FY26 base.
This is 1.6% less than FY25 Actuals.
There's no release from the surplus in the base budget, that's a total of $36.8 billion
of total state General Funds.
It's important to note that these projections incorporate the expected fiscal effects of
the governor's proposed tax changes announced last week.
Personal income tax, and corporate income tax rates for FY26 are assumed to be 20 basis
points lower, and for FY27 is assumed to be 30 basis points lower than the FY25 baseline
on a blended rate basis.
He heard from the governor at exit issues, the state of the state, as well as his address
before the joint committee about his priorities for the revenue growth being recognized in
this budget.
The governor's priorities in building this year's budget include, number one, returning
revenue to taxpayers, number two, utilizing the midterm budget to make high impact one
time investments into infrastructure and economic development.
For three, prioritize public safety, particularly in security improvements in our state prisons
and support for state law enforcement officers.
And finally, number four, fully fund formula and enrollment growth in existing programs,
fund new legislation passed by this body and signed by the Governor last session,
and annualize items initially funded in the FY26 budget.
This is generally what we usually call work load growth and ensures that our current program
commitments are appropriately funded.
You will find that the governor's budget recommendations closely align with these priorities.
Just to briefly review some highlights from the proposed budget, first for taxes.
The revenue estimate has built in the return of about $750 million each year on an annualized
basis back to taxpayers through lowering the personal and corporate income
tax rate from 5.19% to 4.99% effective for tax year 2025. If the General Assembly
supports this proposal, the state would have reduced its income tax rate by
76 bips are 13.2% over the last three years. That's $4 billion in income tax
savings. Not explicitly in the budget is another round of income tax rebates, which is
returning surplus revenue to taxpayers. If approved, this would be the fourth such
rebate following those approved in 2022, 2023, and 2025. The proposed 2026 rebate represents
It's a one-time refund of over $1.17 billion and is equivalent to about 7.2% of personal
income tax collected in 2025 being returned to tax payers, 7.2% of personal income tax collected
in 2025 being returned to tax payers, I'll stop it too.
If approved, the checks will be mailed to eligible tax payers directly from the state treasury
and deducted from the surplus fund balance.
In terms of infrastructure and economic development
in the midterm budget priority, the governor's AFY26 budget
recommends over $2.3 billion in general funds
to accelerate transportation projects,
including the expansion of express lines
on I-75 South of Atlanta.
These investments, I want to note,
are above and beyond growth in the dedicated
motor fuel funds that are included in the budget.
So these state funds that the governors put in,
putting in $2.3 billion are above and beyond
the motor fuel funds that are in the budget.
The governor's budget also includes one-time investments
in economic development programs in rural communities.
As Commissioner Nundis stated,
these included $15 million to replenish
the one Georgia Rural Site Development Program,
which was established in 2024 to assist rural communities
to prepare large development-ready sites,
$35 million to GIFA, the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority,
to seed a revolving loan program
for local governments, development authorities,
and public utilities to finance the development
of natural gas infrastructure.
When you pass Senate Bill 13 last year,
you recognize that the availability of natural gas
is often the key driver of industrial recruitment
and business retention in many communities
like the resources to provide upfront financing
for these projects.
This is an attempt to begin to fix that problem.
Finally, in the rural economic development bucket,
there's almost $14 million to implement recommendations
of the governor's timber task force,
including almost $10.9 million
to support the adoption of technology developed at Georgia Tech
that utilizes wood scraps for carbon solutions
in the automotive parts and pharmaceutical industries.
I also want to mention $33.2 million provided in the governor's capital budget to draw down
federal funds for the drinking water and clean water state revolving funds.
Both in last year's budget and this year's budget we have included a larger than normal
state funds infusion to draw down the increased federal funds made available as part of the
bipartisan infrastructure law.
It's 33.2 million is twice what we generally put in to the state revolving funds as matching funds
These funds are critical to local communities for replacing our expanding drinking water and wastewater systems
reducing lead and drinking water and managing PFAS contamination
Public safety you heard about this this morning the governor's budget includes large additions to the Georgia Department of Corrections as well as
improvement in the retirement benefits for state law enforcement officers.
We worked closely together last year on the GDC budget and we saw historic additions of
over $650 million to improve staffing ratios, hardened existing facilities, and expand
bed space.
This year's proposed budget for the Georgia Department of Corrections includes over $200
million for capital improvement at existing facilities.
$55 million annualized for inmate physical health care, mental health services, and dental services,
and $27 million for $335 new correctional officers to improve the staff to offender ratio.
The governor announced at the State of the State a special law enforcement retirement plan
for officers currently enrolled in the G-CEPS tier. The new plan is an enhanced employer match
contributions to the 401k savings portion of the plan.
You know G-Seps is a hybrid plan, it has a pinching component and a 401k
component. This impacts the 401k or the savings portion of the plan.
Under the proposed plan, employer matched to the savings plan of state law
enforcement officers would increase after five years of service by two
percentage points each year, capping out at 15% of the salary at year 10.
To be eligible for the full state match, employees must continue to contribute 5% of their salary
to the savings plan.
I will not go over the math, but the increased contribution plus compounding will result
in a significantly enhanced benefit at retirement and result in a plan that is among the most
generous among our surrounding states and local jurisdictions.
The governor's budget reflects a $5.2 million increase spread across law enforcement agencies
to help pay for the projected costs of the increase of match.
Last thing I want to talk about is workload.
We have talked about significant tax relief and infrastructure growth investment, infrastructure
and growth investments in the governor's budget proposal.
It's important to emphasize that we are able to make those investments without cutting
existing agency programs or budgets to pay for it.
Addressing formula and workload growth in a state
this large is a big lift.
When people ask me, where is the budget growth going to?
The answer is most of it goes to workload
or just maintaining what we are already doing.
The AFLY 26 budget contains over $320 million for workload
growth and $1.5 billion for workload growth in the big base budget.
Let me repeat that.
There's an additional $1.5 billion in the FY27 budget just to keep up with the growth
in our existing programs and funding formulas mandated by law.
That's 4% growth in our state general funds budget and that is fairly typical.
The largest workload increases, as usually as the case, are in education and health care.
The governor's budget includes a $550 million increase in earnings for K-12 education.
$27.6 million for dual enrollment growth.
$33 million for TCSG credit-hour growth.
And $219 million for enrollment growth at USG, all in the FY27 budget.
For health care and human services, this includes $237 million for Medicaid growth, $23 million
in increases at DBHCD, and over $65 million in increases at DHS.
I'll close by mentioning a few other significant proposals in the governor's budget.
The governor's FY27 budget proposal recommends a debt package for capital projects.
You heard from Diana this morning.
we have not issued any debt for the past two years,
instead paying for our capital improvements
with our balance sheet.
You heard directly from the governor
on the benefits of doing so.
They're savings of $3.3 billion in interest payments
over the next 20 years.
We have reduced the state's outstanding debt by 20%
and lowered our debt service to revenue ratio to 3%,
which is significantly less than the constitutional cap
of 10% and the lowest it's been since the state
begin issuing general obligation bonds.
We are no longer in a position
when we can fully use cash to fund our routine capital needs.
However, we are returning to the debt market
with substantially less debt burden
and greater flexibility to meet future budget needs.
About $600 million in capital spending
is funded with cash in the AFY26 budget.
For AFY27, the governor's proposed debt package
is just over $650 million in authorized principle.
So bottom line is our debt package is roughly split 50-50
this year between debt and cash.
Second thing I want to emphasize is the Governor's AFI-20
just mentioned here a moment ago, the Governor's AFI-26 budget
proposes $50 million for a grant program
to local governments and nonprofits
to address street-level homelessness.
Grant recipients will be expected to put up local or private funds in order to be eligible.
And though grants may be used for emergency shelter, transitional housing, outreach engagement and wraparound services,
the funding is intended as one time with a goal of building community support and involvement
around high impact interventions to address the homelessness problem in this state.
The AFY-26 budget includes a one-time salary supplement of $2,000 for state
employees, border regions employees, and teachers to keep our workforce and help
them deal with higher inflation.
The total cost here is $612 million.
And finally, the AFY-26 budget provides $325 million to the University
System of Georgia Foundation dreams program to provide needs base aid to
students pursuing an associate degree, bachelor's degree,
or technical degree.
The dream scholarship program is an endowment whose earnings
provide annual needs-based scholarship funds.
The purpose of this appropriation to the endowment
is to incentivize philanthropic and private donors
to contribute.
A reasonable goal for the foundation
is to have a total of $1.8 billion for the endowment,
Assuming reasonable returns,
that should be generated about $80 million
on average in current dollars each year
for needs-based pay.
Chairman Hatchett, Chairman Tillery,
I will close my remarks there.
We have been working on this budget for the last seven months
and now we're happy to hand it off to you.
To that end, I hope this has been helpful
and I look forward to continuing to work with you,
your subcommittee chairs and members of your committees
as we work our way through the process.
Thank you.
But before we have anybody asking any questions,
we just want to make sure you know that Representative
Stinson has a building in Taylor County.
I'll look into OPB South, but you're welcome now.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Director Dunn, thank you for all the great work you do for all
of Georgia.
I appreciate working with you.
I have some concerns on the $50 million housing initiative.
I support the idea, but it's in the amended budget and that's a new program that's
Gotta be rolled out and deployed before
You know July 1 that does that give you pause or
Certainly all those dollars will not likely be allocated prior to July the first
But hey, we anticipated be a good case for reserve of those funds if the processes are
started. Mr. Chairman could I ask you to follow up along the same lines? Yes, sir.
Two and a half billion in transportation infrastructure. Yes, sir. Certainly I see the need for that.
It just seems like that would take a long time to get spent. How will that work? Yes, so for example,
Well, I-75 is placed in Sirter's budget, which is an authority in that subject to labs for those very reasons.
But those funds will be in Comburn, yes sir.
Thank you.
Representative Evans.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Director.
You were talking about the dream scholarship, which a lot of us are very excited about.
Hopefully, everybody's excited about it.
But you mentioned there that that could be used for any degree, including technical.
And I had asked a question the chancellor earlier this week about my concern that those dollars
were only listed under the USG budget and there was no mention of them in the TCSG budget.
So I wanted to see where I may be missing something, hopefully my concern is misplaced.
So the current dreams foundation, the current USG foundations dreams program, both TCSG
the USG are eligible, and we're just adding to that.
So they will, I'm sorry.
Yes ma'am.
Now I will also know we included another million dollars
for college completion grant explicitly
for TCSG students.
And the last thing I'm mentioning here is
we've got some pretty good data
on the financial need of USG students.
We don't have a lot of good data yet
on the needs gap, if you will, for TCS students,
once you consider hope, career grant, things like that.
But again, we look forward to understanding more
about that need, and again, our expectation
it would be used for both.
Yeah, and it sounded like from the commissioner
that, well, and I know from work over the past years
that there definitely is a gap.
There's not gonna be a gap for everybody,
but there's still a gap for a lot.
And on average, you go and plug five students out of US,
G-Institution, you go plug five out of a TCSD,
more than likely the students that you plug out of TCSG are going to be in those households
under $40,000 or $50,000 a year. So certainly we have the need. But I just want to make
clear so it doesn't matter that that money is listed just in the USG budget. TCSG students
would still be eligible. That's correct. We expect the dreams program to continue to operate
as structured and as currently structured TCSG students are eligible.
And what about the students at the the private colleges?
would not be included. Okay. They're not eligible now and that's correct. Okay. Thank you.
Director Dunn. Awesome. You must have done a great presentation. I like being last.
Thank you. Look forward to working with you. Yeah. Members, just reminder that all the
presentations that were made our own line under the House Budget Office tab on the legislative
site. There are committee subcommittee meetings tomorrow and there are subcommittee meetings scheduled
for Tuesday. If there are any changes there like everything just keep you informed and look out
for notices from the speaker and from the Lieutenant Governor's offices on attendance and
those issues but and also these are house subcommittee meetings senate members are invited to attend so they can learn as much as they want.
Mr. Chair.
Is that sort of would that be considered dual enrollment, Mr. Chair? I'm trying to figure that out.
Thank you all members for being here this past three days.
You put a lot of hours, a lot of time in this, as you know, there have been over 40 presentations so far.
Some things to remember, we are on a timeline.
And while the weather interrupts that timeline, it does not slow it down.
So please keep a watch of your emails.
Also, you've got the Governor's budget book to roll through.
You know the subcommittees that you're on already.
expect that we will have to start rolling those very, very soon in order to keep up with the timeline that has been laid out by the full calendar.
Thank you so much for your attendance, for your participation and Chairman Hatchett, you get the last word.
We're adjourned.
