----------
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome, so glad that so many people are so bored this morning
you decided to get up and join us at 7 a.m. Thanks to everyone for being here, at least
if you would, open us an order to pray, please.
Let's pray.
Heavenly Father, I thank you that we have the opportunity
to do this good work here for the good people of Georgia
that we represent and I do pray that throughout this morning,
we will operate with wisdom, justice, courage,
and moderation.
You're only my pray, amen.
Amen.
Thank you.
I will kick us off and call this education appropriations
committee meeting to order.
With that, we will get started, I believe everybody.
Road does have a copy of the budget.
If you will go over with me to 24.2.3,
we are adding money to take care of some facilities
that are in dire need of that.
24.6.3, if committee members, if you will remember,
this funds our PSAT, our IP and our IB test,
and the reason that we continue to see this here
in the amended budget. This is above and beyond. This is the demand. This is the demand
for those tests that we're paying for, but these are actual costs. And so probably a
bigger discussion in the big budget that we need to have about increasing the base. There
have a number of true ups in 24.18. Then if we come across to 24.22.3, if any of you come
to Chairman Erwin's Education Committee meetings.
We talk about focusing on literacy and we talk about focusing on safety and learning.
This is one of those safety initiatives.
This is a school safety pilot program that we'll see across four high schools in the coming
year.
We're really doubling down on not only the 3D mapping that's required by law, if you'll
remember that we passed but this is also adding a very intriguing program from
campus guardian angel and adding drones happy to share that with you and tell
you more about it. This is a program that the likes of which I have seen that I'm
very very excited about. You'll go over with me to section 25 and ERS 25.4.1 we're
making a $50 million infusion of cash there to ERS that will help improve our funding ratio.
27.13.2 this is a program that is sunsetting with a set date of April 1st so we're able
to find some savings there and with that we're done with that part of the budget are there
any questions? Chairman Jones. I have no questions but at the appropriate time
sir. It is the appropriate time. Motion due pass. We have a motion we have a
second we have a second. Any further discussion? Hearing none all those in
favor please say aye. All opposed like sign? We stand adjourned.

Well it's quiet, we'll go ahead and we're a little early but we'll go ahead and get
started.
I'm filling in for Chairman Meeks.
He's home taking care of family.
He's fine, but we have our multiple roles we've got to fill.
So he's doing that today.
We'll start today with section 13, Department of Agriculture,
13.3.5, a little adjustment for increase
and lost from COLA and shortfalls over the last few years.
In it 13, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8, those are additional funds of 250,100 and 105,000 per software
upgrade for animal health, plant protection and structural pest divisions.
$13.4.5 is $250,000 for other agriculture improvements.
13.8.3 and soil and water conservation commission
on 31,443 for a new plan reviewer position and 13.8.4 is $57,120.
or some retention money for his plan reviewers.
That turnover rate has been very high,
so we're trying to help them there.
16.8.1, the Governor put in 35 million
for the George Environmental Finance Authority
for natural gas infrastructure. We were keeping that at 35 million and at 16.8.2 we
added 50 million who increased funds for rural infrastructure for economic
development. The rural parts of our state. 23.1.4 under economic development the
$100,000 for an entrepreneurial support program at $23,4, the Council for the Arts,
a special project of one-time funding of $250,250 for community art grants.
At Tourism Under Economic Development, $23,10.3 increased funds for the Georgia Humanities
for the American 250 initiative.
Increase that to $250,000, $250.00.
Under Georgia Forestry, Section 26, 26.1.4, $100,000
to support the leadership program for agriculture forestry
and veterinary medicine.
at 26.3 under parstery protection provided $532,293 for own call pay effective April 1st of 2026 and under section 40 the public service commission
line 40.3.3 added some additional funds for an engineer effective April 1st, 2026 of $36,125
and at 40.3.4 $31,875 for a financial analyst for the Public Service Commission.
That is all of the changes under the Economic Development Section. Any questions?
I don't see any questions.
Chairman Green. Thank you, Miss Chairman. I move to pass.
All in favor?
Say aye. Aye. All right. Thank you.
You
We're going to proceed with the transportation budget and we're going to review the changes
the House made to the Governor's recommendation starting with $47.1.3. We added $15 million
to the airport aid. Followed by $47.2.3, $85 million for the rehabilitation and replacement
of rural bridges. The Governor's recommendation had this in capital maintenance. The G.Dod asked
us to move it to capital construction, so they could better administer that. $47.3.1. This
is the item that we moved to capital construction. So it zeroed that out. 47.11.4 million, $245,000 for
repairs, replacements, and upgrades to state-owned short-line rail. And finally, 47.16.1 billion,
$715 million, $747,000 for the extension and bidirectional expansion of the R-75 express
lanes in Clayton and Henry counties.
So that concludes the changes the house has made.
Do we have any questions?
I don't see any questions.
We have a motion.
All right.
We've got a motion.
Do we have a second?
All in favour?
Say aye.

Do pass.

start with Section 5, Appeals Court, in the judicial area, as you'll see, consistently
through it, 2,000 times one time bumps for salary employees as well as reflected employer
contribution rate from a state health benefit plan coming down.
So we won't talk about those going forward, but there's no changes in the Appeals Court.
6th Judicial Council. There is a change 6.1.3, personal services to reflect the actual start date of
$66,302, the 6.1.4, one-time fund, payment for accountability court for the case management system, $150,000.

6.2, there's no changes there.
6.4, there's a one-time change or 6.4.3, $27,150,
four actual start date of a position.
A lot back of that, 6.5, 0.3,
reduced utilize funds for legal fees of $50,000 callback.
Section 6, Judicial Council, there is a $6.8.3
increased funds for one-time costs of annually payout.
That's a callback there, from $41,000,
$6.10.4, that's a callback for actual, sorry,
6.10.2, 6.10.3, and 6.10.4 for Georgia Tax Court.

Section 7, Judicial Council.
There are no changes there outside of the one-time fees.
Section 8, there are no changes there.

have any questions for goody? Do you have a motion? Move to pass, have a second. All
in favor say aye. Thank you all.

Good morning, everyone. We're a little ahead of schedule, but I'm going to call the appropriation
subcommittee on higher education to order. If we can go to Section 41 under the University
system of Georgia or 25 systems there, 25 units under agriculture experiments section
and 41.1.2 you'll see a true up that's related to delayed start dates and positions that
are not filled that were budgeted last year. So you'll see several of those as we go along
and I'll just call those a start date true up. That's 180,000 true up on that 41.1.2
in the Agriculture Experiment Station due to actual start dates.
Then down to 41.1.3, provide one-time funds for operational and equipment needs to support
blueberry breeder research.
That's a $500,000 edition.
There's a request for a million, but the House is putting together that 500 is recommending
that $500,000 there.
If you go on down to Cooperative Extension Service, 41.3.2, that's a start date true
up of $112,000. If we keep progressing on under 41.13, the Medical College of
Georgia Hospitals and Clinics, there's an additional 200,000 to increase funds
to expand the current partnership with Clark Atlanta University for prostate
cancer research. So very important position there. If you keep going to 41.14.2,
We have an addition for the Pines program that's the Public Information Network for Electronic
Services to assist our public libraries going down to the Regent's Central Office in
41.16 on their 41.16.2 we have an additional, we have a recommendation for $300 million
is an endowment for the dream scholarship, a life-changing potential there that we're
looking forward to working on.
There is an additional 25 million that's been discussed.
We're waiting for some exact details from the Board of Regents in writing so the appropriations
can be properly delineated.
If you go down to 41.16.3, we've got some delayed implementation of an alternative college
admission test of $15,000 change.
We have an increase on 41.16.4 for Galileo access of $67,000.
We have some other true ups in the George Commission on the Holocaust and public telecommunications.
If you're going down under Student Finance under Section 44, we have several of our scholarships,
grants, and service-cancelled loan programs which due to the appropriations and differing
amounts of participation and applicants, eligible applicants, we have significant reserves
in many of those programs.
So I'll list a few of those.
The hero scholarship, under $44.6.1, $280,000 true up, under $41.11.1, a million true up,
44.15.1 public service memorial grant of $540,000 true up and then service
cancelable loans under 44.17. Several of those there are true ups based to
significant reserves exceeding a typical annual appropriation under those as
well. Let's see. And under the technical college system of Georgia under section 46, we do
not have any direct adjustments to that. So those are the higher education budget recommendations
from the subcommittee. Is there any questions for higher education subcommittee? If not,
It is about here.
