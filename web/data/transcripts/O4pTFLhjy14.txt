This kind of be, you know, so beautiful day. And we will begin this day with scripture reading and prayer by the Chaplain after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 146th House District, Chairman Shaw Blackman, the chair of the House of Ways and Means Committee. Chairman Blackman. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning. Really excited today to have two friends passed or just in Guest and his wife Tina sitting to our right. They are a lovely couple, have a lovely family and a wonderful ministry, really an exciting emerging ministry in Perry, Georgia, part of the present church and really excited to have him here today. Pastor Gaston, I'm going to turn it over to you and I know he will bless us all here this morning with his word. Good morning, everyone. We feel it this morning. You got your coffee. You guys excited? Right. I made you laugh all right. I'm done for the day. I'm honored to be here. Thank you, Speaker. I think you, Mr. Blackman, if they have a man, my wife, I'm excited to share with what I have. You gave a black preacher five minutes and I'll do my best. All right. I can't promise you that. No, I got you. I got you. But I want to excuse me, just start off by saying that as a chaplain of the day, I feel like this is an opportunity for me to serve you to minister to you. I just learned that there are some days you guys are here to midnight. So I'm not trying to help you do your job. You got that, all right. But I do want to serve you. I do want to encourage you. I want to share the scripture with you. It isn't it isn't second Kings chapter five. And before I do that, I want to ask you this this simple but profound question. How are you? How are you? Can we take a moment and pull back our titles, our districts? And I just want to ask you this real simple but profound question. How are you? In second Kings chapter five, there is this commander and his name is name and in the reads, it says that and he was a great man in the sight of his master and highly regarded. Because up here, Slower had made, excuse me, it says that because God had given him great victory, he was a great soldier, but name and had leprosy. And we see that there's this commander name, name and there's this king name, name and he was great. He was wonderful at what he does. But the Bible says he had a condition. Now, everyone in the room can agree on this one thing that at some point in our lives, we've all had a but issue. If it wasn't for a but issue, we would not have no need for Jesus to be here. So we see the story of name and who is great at what he does. He is wonderful what it does, but but but he has this issue. When naming was out at battle, no one could see his leprosy. He had this armor on. He was great at what he does. He was wonderful. He was a wise sister, but no one could see name and issue behind this armor. So the question I present today is who are you when the armor comes off? When these days are over, we're done with these meetings. Who are we when we go back to our homes? We see name and he is he is great as a king, but when he goes to his house, his servant daughter says, I wish my master would go see all the prophet. It's the people at home that see the things that hide underneath the surface. So I asked this question again, how are you? Each day, it gets easier for us to allow what we do to become who we are. And we become people who work well for God, but don't walk well with God. But if you want, but I want to inform you that God cares about your walk more than he cares about your work and your work is important. And I believe you guys have done an incredible job with how you manage this state, but we all must understand that our work is temporary and our souls are eternal. And as chapter of the day, I'm not here to focus on your work. I'm here to focus on your walk, your soul and your heart. There are so many people that only care about who you are in this room, but God cares about who you are at home. When the armor comes off, when the ties comes off, when the laptop closes, when these sessions are over, when you go back to your spouses and your children, who are we and are we okay? And if your answer is no, you need to know that God cares about you. If I had one assignment this morning, it is to let you know that after all of this, there is a God in heaven that cares about you. It is in 1st Peter chapter 5 verse 7, it says to cast all your anxieties on him because he cares for us. If you don't remember anything, go aside, say, if you never see me again, if you never visit Perry, Georgia, I want you to know that God cares about you. He cares about your family, cares about your marriage, he cares about your children, and most importantly, he cares about your soul. He cares about our state, he cares about our country. We are not alone, we are not abandoned, we are not forsaken, we are not orphans, our God cares about us. And the greatest lesson I've had to learn as a pastor was that I would never have a title greater than God's son. And though we sit on many seats in this room, there would never be a title greater than you being God's child. Can we say amen to that? I want to remind you in this room that your God's daughter, your God's son, now Father in heaven cares about us. And like a good dad, there is nothing that we cannot bring to him. So when the armor comes off, when these sessions are over, my question is, how are you? And if there are things that are underneath our armor family that we feel no one in this room knows about, always remember we have a Father in heaven that cares about us. Let's pray. Father we thank you for who you are, God, we thank you for your presence. God you're wonderful. There's no one like you, God, you are matchless. God we thank you for every person that is in this room. And may we be reminded in this room, God, that you care about our walks, that you care about our souls. So I pray right now that we would always know we have a place that we can go to in your presence to be vulnerable and to be open and be ourselves. God we thank you for your presence. We love you. We honor you since Jesus stand we pray. Amen. Religious to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic of which it stands, one nation, one God, indivisible, liberty and justice for all. Doorkeepers will unlock the doors.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker, five to go. Thank you ladies and gentlemen for the opportunity to come to the well. I want you to join me. We have some special guests viewing online this morning. Miss McCann's second grade elementary school from Scraven as is joining in and want to wish John. We are my happy birthday, so if you will join in and help me, you can hear my happy birthday. Love you, buddy. Chair recognizes representative Al Williams for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. There was a sheet on your desk and I didn't get to come forward until today, but it was on the pledge. This will seem frivolous to some, but being the son of a school teacher of 42 years, she taught me that if his wrong mentioned it. In the early 40s, the pledge of allegiance was done with the right hand extended because of the German's anoxysum that was moved to the heart. In 1954, in the Eisenhower administration, the words under God was added to the pledge and the old karma was after nation. Under God was added, the karma came after God and if you had the sheets you see it. For some reason, we are determined, except for my colleagues to my right on that distinguished front row and one or two on the second row. We are determined to put the karma after nation under God and then the poles. That's the proper way. And if you don't listen, don't worry about it. If Jacob should not lose his reward, if Israel does not hear. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes representative Roba Show for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As we continue to celebrate women's history month, I come to the well today to honor former Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, who passed last Wednesday. As many of you know, she was an American diplomat who served as the first female Secretary of State for the United States. She was appointed to the position in 1997 and served until 2001. Prior to that appointment, she served as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations from 1993 to 1997. She was a Jewish immigrant from Czechoslovakia as her family had fled during World War II to escape Nazi invasion and came to America in 1948. Through her hard work and dedication to service, she was the epitome of the American dream. I actually had the privilege of meeting Secretary Albright in 2009, sitting next to her for a three-hour flight from Washington, D.C. to Dallas. And it was a privilege. Secretary Albright was actually fluent in eight languages. So what she showed me on that flight was her daily reading list. She pulled out ten newspapers from different languages, and she said she read those every day to keep up. But luckily for me, she chose to talk to me instead of reading that morning. So I actually was very star-struck listening to her for those hours as we discussed our families. What it was like to be a working mom who traveled a lot, which I did at the time. Her view of world events mainly heard vice as to how to have a long and happy marriage. She had lost her husband the love of her life after only 23 years of marriage. And I can say honestly that her advice has helped me to celebrate 44 years of marriage to Rory, the love of my life, with the hope of many more. So please join me in a moment of silence to honor this amazing woman and American patriot. Thank you, Mrs. Speaker. Chair recognizes representative Bonner for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This morning I rise to defend my caucus, this House, and our governor. Last week we were accused of doing things that were considered disgusting. And let me tell you what was considered disgusting. Given teachers pay raises, refunding over a billion dollars in taxes. Suspending the gas tax so that hardworking Georgians could get to-

work. These things were considered disgusting by someone who is seeking the highest office in this state. And I know you're wondering why should we care what a failed Senate candidate thinks. Well frankly, I don't. But good policy is good policy. And this was good for the hard working people of Georgia. So I will defend my caucus. I will defend this house. And I will buy God support Brian Kempf for governor. Thank you so much Mr. Speaker. I yielded well. Chair recognizes representative Buckner for a morning order. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I'm down here to ask for a favor from you guys so we can ask for a favor from governor Kempf. Many of us live in communities where the trains that have gotten to be two miles long are blocking crossings. We had a problem with this in my area and we were able to sit down with the railroad and negotiate some opportunities for them to split the crossings and do some things to help out. It has become a problem in other communities. So there's a letter here asking the governor if he would sit down with the railroads and maybe negotiate like we did in my district and had some success. So if you're interested in signing the letter so he'll know what areas are involved please see me and sign it at my desk. Thank you. Chair recognizes chairman Collins and representative Tyler Paul Smith for a morning order. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of this house West Georgia lost a tighten of our legal community over the weekend. Judge Alton P. Johnson, Chief Magistrate Court Judge of Carol County went home to be with Lord this past Saturday. He was appointed in 1998 to fulfill an unexpired term for Carol County and he went on to serve six consecutive terms all unopposed. A rite of passage for young lawyers in our area was the custom of him yelling at you and truly you had not ran the gauntlet until he did that but he was always just as quicked up to apologize. I'm truly going to miss him as well all the members of the West Georgia bar in our community. I would ask that this house please join us in a moment of silence for Judge Johnson. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes representative Hutchinson for a morning order. Thank you Mr. Speaker. This morning colleagues I bring to you 13 year old Mikaela. She is a bright bubbly loving girl who loves country music and pop music. Her favorite artist is Luke Brian. She also enjoys swimming, singing, dancing and watching Disney movies. As we round out women's history month it's up to us to find her a forever home to see the type of woman she's going to be. Thank you Mr. Speaker and I yield the well. Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes representative Carpenter. Chairman Carpenter for a morning order. Ladies and gentlemen of this house I cannot sit around any longer and allow my US representative to ruin our party. Your bathroom comments this weekend were completely out of line. Your ugliness, lugliness may get into pause at a one-sided event but it does not grow the Republican party across this state or nation. As a parent of four it's my responsibility to show my children how to disagree with kindness. Clearly this was not conveyed to you in your childhood. I understand that we live in a soundbite society but the long term success of our party is about building bridges not burning down the house. You failed to mention pulling for Russia and Putin in the Ukrainian war too but I digress. Chair recognizes chairman Jasper's for a morning order. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members I rise this morning with some sad news from one of our transportation friends. Many of you know Josh Waller the legislative liaison for the Georgia G-DOT. He's a guy that answers our questions about roads and bridges and all that good stuff. Josh's mom Mary Frances Waller passed away yesterday after a long illness. Josh's family had been caring for her for quite some time and I'll tell you what Josh is a great son. Members as you pray please keep the Waller family in your prayers and Josh and if we may take a moment of silence in the honor of Mary Frances Waller and Josh. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes for the final seconds of the morning orders representative Demetrius Douglas. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I'll make a quick our girl 6A Wild Love Joy Wildcats from Clayton County want to state championship. If you're around today they're going to be here on a tour just saying congratulations to them. Demetrius Coach thank you. Members of the House will come to order. Members of the House will come to order. Chair is going to ask that you be seated. Chair will ask again that you be seated. Chair recognizes Chairman Heath Clark for a special order. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Good morning colleagues. My family is on their way down so I'll mention them in a little bit but you know 8 years goes by very fast and I'm not like some of the guys that are here like my colleague Wes Cantrell. When he ran he said I'm only going to do four terms and I'm done I'm gone. That wasn't me. Even though we came in together now we're leaving together man but for me this was a hard decision. I love being here. I love this body. I love the work we do and it was hard because I also over the last six to seven months started wrestling with whether or not to run for another term. Just my kids were getting older they're about to hit some vital ages the pre-teen teenage years they're moving into there and I just started feeling that I needed to be home with them and I didn't miss some time and I just before even getting all that too I just want to tell everybody if you're from if you live outside of a certain radius and you have to stay here it's hard there's a lot of sacrifice not only that we make as legislators but our families make the time that they miss and there's a lot of times that legislators walk in the round with a very heavy heart and a sense of guilt and shame because they're not home and they're missing some things that are back home or they had a phone conversation late in an afternoon we're here very late and they miss a phone or they have a phone conversation their their kid asks why when are you coming home or on Sunday night when you're tucking them into bed you're about to hit the road to come up here to be here for a Monday morning and they ask when are you coming home dad and you want you come here and there's a sense of guilt that a lot of members you might not know it because we're politicians that we can put on a strong face we're used to carrying around a lot of people's burdens so just give you know that's something I want to encourage everybody like I have been here and I have felt it where encouragement from other members of this body and I want to thank you for that you we really do become a family in your time of service here that's not just a mantra or a saying you really do nobody knows what we go through except the people that are able to sit in these seats and thank you all so I was just a guy who went to work every day clocked in at Robin's Air Force Base a contractor I wasn't even a boss I had a green stripe on my card that I wore and you know a GS-10 could fire me if they wanted to and so I was just a guy that showed up and went to work nobody really knew who I was in fact when I was knocking on doors that first time I remember one time I knocked on a door and a guy I didn't even introduce myself yet I was just he saw I had a shirt on and campaigned to I want to know who that Heath Clark guy is I was like oh really and he began to like slam me I was like and tell me what what I believed and where I stood on issues I was like sir that's I don't think he believes that I don't think that's where his positions are on that issue he's like well how do you know hi I'm Heath Clark and uh that proceeded to be like a 30-minute conversation where and I still don't know if I got his vote or not but it was just kind of it shocked him a little bit but I just started to get involved and decided to run and uh what before I even decided to run I'm starting to wrestle with this decision about like I didn't know I didn't know what running for office looked like or how it went I had helped with some campaigns but I didn't really know um and I just started feeling that prompting to run and and I won't share all the reasons about why I chose to run for this seat but I remember there was distinctly one night where um my wife and I we were praying about it and uh and and it was I think this is the night where she knew we were about to run because I look over at her after we're finished praying and she is sobbing guys I'm not talking about just crying I mean I'm talking tears flowing out her she can't catch her breath and the words that came out of her mouth was I thought I was marrying a pastor not a politician that's the exact opposite so um in my response that was well it doesn't have to be um so you know she cried and I think and then the next thing she came out of her mouth when she calmed down and she got settled down uh she looked at me she said if we're going to run we're going to win and that was the kind of person she was like so she she was basically my first campaign manager she started bossing me around and telling me what to do and where to go and where the volunteers were going to meet and you know we only raised $15,000 in that first election didn't have a whole lot of money but we did a very low tech campaign we knocked on over 5,000 houses um 5,000 doors in a primary to ask people to vote I just people didn't know who I was I had to introduce myself and I thought the best way to do it was to knock on their door and introduce myself instead of showing up in an event where the same people were at the same events all over town and um one of those I had I got into a bad habit where you're walking around and back up to we had just literally just had our third child one week and then we're out knocking on like my third my third child Anderson was one week old when we started knocking on door so I had a three year old a two year old and a newborn that we're going around knocking on door I'm telling you on my wife is gritty she's strong and um so but there was I got into a bad habit of like I would knock on the door and be like oh crap whose house is this and I have to look and find the name and um we knocked on one door and it was it was sunny watching and I don't know if a lot of y'all know him he sir he was one of the people my predecessors that had this seat and I didn't know it all of a sudden I'm like oh oh and he's still a big name back around Houston County and um so I knock on his door and it's it's sunny watching so I start talking to him he's asking me all kinds of questions and and all of a sudden I had a liza with me that day that's my she's she's my second oldest I had her with me and she looks at me she's like dad I got to go potty and I'm in this middle conversation with a you know an outstanding citizen and this story me and Wes had talked before about it we need to compile a list of campaign stories because most people think campaign stories are these grand big events where you get up and give like a red meat speech and you get everybody cheering and into like a fit and that's not campaigning campaigning is is tough knocking on doors and this day she's with me and daddy I got to go potty and like okay give me a minute trying to finish up this conversation and then I hear daddy and I knew that word I looked and there's a and I don't want to embarrass her but there's a puddle forming around her feet and I I looked at her and she starts crying and my heart broke but you know she was there for me and all of them have always been there for me if I was knocking on doors they were there if we needed to go take pretty family pictures with gnats flying around your head they were there and I guess that's why I'm not running because I'm tired of not being there and a lot has changed in the last eight years politically a lot has changed it's divisive like I don't remember before in my lifetime I mean we had a civil war one time we were pretty divided nation at that point too but just in my lifetime there's division like never before and even coming here I know people were skeptical of me because I ran against an incumbent and won and so I know my party was probably what do we have here and who is he going to be in ought to be quite honest I was skeptical of y'all too you were politicians you were dirty rotten people of society and now that I'm leaving I know that to be true I'm just kidding just kidding but I do remember the day I got sworn in somebody came up to me right after I got sworn because you know you come in as the as the freshman thing I'm going to change this place I'm going to you know I got an agenda and I'm going to do it somebody came up to me and shook my hand said congratulations you're now part of the problem so and you know the funny and he said and I was like really and he said I don't care he's like I don't care how you vote you're part of the problem and that's pretty much been true you got yelled at for things like look I voted no on that like why are you yelling at me so or so there are some things that changed over the court that I think allowed me to become a better legislator and one of those was it was either my first year second year I you know that's back when you're answering and writing long responses to every single email you get even if they're not your constituent being honest like you're writing these long drafted out emails and I leave about seven o'clock and I'm just a stop by a little restaurant on the way to the apartment that I was staying at now walk in and then the speaker was there just by himself it was laundry day if I'm not mistaken Mr. Speaker I think you told me it was your laundry day so you were you were there just having a random dinner by yourself and I was there and we ended up having a dinner together unplanned and we just talked about life we just talked about our families we just talked about everything other than politics really and I got to know the speaker a little bit that day and it mattered you know he protects this house he protects our caucus and he takes a lot of arrows and he gets a lot of criticism but he has fought diligently to maintain the autonomy of this house and for that I'm forever grateful Mr. Speaker. Chairman Alan Powell I don't know if he's ever gotten a thank you and I don't even see think he's in here I don't know if anybody's ever stood up here and thanked him but and I still don't know if this was he was giving me a chance or he was trying to punish me but he gave me he let me be the chairman of the two-way subcommittee where we took up all the second amendment bills one session I think it was my third year here and so I don't know if he was trying to help me out or if he was punishing me but we took it up and I took I mean that was a beating but I will say this being the chairman of that subcommittee it allowed me to prove myself that so one day that the speaker would have the confidence in naming me a chair of my own committee and so for that chairman Alan Powell I'm thankful for you and thank you for that opportunity if you have sir if you're currently serving on the defense inventions affairs or if you served on the military affairs study committee could you stand up please if the military affairs study committee or the committee of defense inventions affairs y'all can we give them a round of applause I you know I want to thank y'all for allowing me to be your chair and we've done a lot of good work as chairman belt and has pointed out to us over 60 bills that we've passed since that military affairs study committee got going to really ramp up the awareness of how to become more military defense friendly veteran friendly in this state and we've done a great job but I really think looking back that being on that that study committee where the relationships that were formed allowed me to build the relationship to be able to be effective in working this body but Dean Smirie I got to travel around the state and talk to you representative Al Williams got you know got to know them there these are legends in our state see heroes chairman Smith I got to got participate on that study committee with chairman Smith to and build the relationship there and then also my seatmate chairman Bill Hitchens you know getting to hear from from these gentlemen and the stories that they had or just the history that they've had has really humbled me as a legislator and I'll never forget one time we were up in Washington DC on that study committee and all of a sudden I'm talking to a three star general and this never happened to me again remember I'm still a contractor at this point for the base so a GS 10 can fire me and I'm talking to a three star general and all of a sudden that three star general snaps to attention because in walked a four star general and I'm like and then I'm talking to the four star general and he snaps to attention because in walked the secretary of the Air Force and I was just like a whole week the next day the next day I show up and I'm sitting down at my queue and like I'm just responsible to the the highest drinking contract I mean a civilian at Robin's Air Force base to send my my area and here I was talking to people snapping to attention with three stars four stars on their shoulder it was that was a that was a crazy moment for me I want to thank all of our admins was Joe chairman Dubnic and I think over the last year we've had about four and because every time we got a good one they would somebody in the capital would pick them off and they would end up over there so this session me and chairman Dubnic we decided to come to the capital ourselves and stop losing our admins and so now I have Miss JC and she she's an amazing admin and I really appreciate her because this session's been a different one for me on many different reasons and all of the doorkeepers you have no idea from a guy who comes up here every day and has to leave his family behind your smiles and hugs how much they mean to me and I two of them are my constituents way from one of our homes they drive up here every day from one of our homes Mr Donna Miss Donna and I want to tell you all thank you Miss Donna you're kind of like yes Miss Donna is kind of like a mother to me she's all like she's checking on my health and seeing if I'm okay and when I'm leaving she's like you get home safe be be careful so thank you Miss Donna Bruce Williamson I want to thank you you're one of the best men I know and I mean that and honestly I wish I could have gotten to know you about 15 years earlier in life you've just always been a mentor a friend and just a confident like something that I can confident that I can trust in and lean on and you gave me a phone call earlier this session where you told me that you had a men's prayer group and y'all called my name in that group when I was going through some health struggles and I appreciate that my house in county delegation Shaw Robert Danny and Noel thank y'all because there are days where you just need a friend everybody you get frustrated around you you get cussing mad even in the majority part I know minority party you might not believe that but even in the majority party you get frustrated you get angry and you get mad and you have to have friends that you can trust that you can go and express yourself to a know it staying right there because you're mad so thank y'all my mom I want to thank her and that first campaign that we had there was two people that I knew were going to show up with me every day to knock on doors one was my wife and one was my mom she's recently been diagnosed with cancer and there's just uncertainty she's a fighter we're going to fight and you know God's good because when I was making this decision not to run it was literally that next week that or week and a half that she got her diagnosis she was already in some pain but we didn't know and I think part of the reason why I kept having that stirring to go back home was because God knew it was on the horizon and we needed to spend some more time together and help her fight her fight and I want to thank my wife Lindsay you're the toughest strongest most beautiful woman I know I couldn't have done this without you you are a fighter for our family when you felt like I was forsaking them you make sure that that I knew that and you know many women have done excellently but you have surpassed them all and for you I'm a better man I remember the day I met you I'm never going to forget that and it took me three years to convince you to marry me but I'm glad that I didn't waver I was smitten from the beginning and I'm still smitten now and it might have taken me three years to convince you to marry me but I'm going to spend the rest of my life convincing you to stay with me so thank you when I announced my campaign can we give her a round of applause to you thank you can you stand up Lindsay so they can see you she's in the back and I know I know that that many of y'all that just turned around and thought like how in the heck did he ever like so I'm not oblivious to the fact that my kids get their good looks from her so so when I announced my campaign I shared with the people that were there that I wanted to represent Jesus more than anything not just in the issues that we took up but in the manner in which I debated you see I above being a dad above being a husband above being a representative my chief title is ambassador for Christ and I remember when someone when I was telling that people that I was leaving someone asked has this place changed you and I looked at him and I just honestly answered and I said yes and I think it shocked them because you know you're supposed to say no but I'm still this principal conservative guy that you know but it has changed me and this is what I told them that I honestly want to love people I disagree with more now than I ever have before that I would rather love people and show people Jesus's love for them more than winning a debate so I've bit my tongue sometimes and even in that you know I'm not perfect so if I've tried to be somebody that has been quick to forgive and quick to ask for forgiveness when I have wrongfully spoken against somebody but I've tried and there's a quote that a friend just reminded me of from the book to kill a mockingbird that you never really understand a person until you consider the things consider things from his point of view until you climb into his skin and walk around in it so I guess my biggest thing is I'm leaving as I just want to challenge you that as our country is more divided than ever before and that kind of politics is making its way into Georgia I want you to fight like heck to not allow that to happen to love people with different points of view than you because their experiences are different and they might come to different conclusions they will never address the solutions that need to be addressed if we're fighting each other and not the issues and not to be dismissive of an issue or somebody else's point of view just because that has not been your life experience and I've discovered that people care more about you being honest with them than what your point of view or position is and two stories that real quick I remember my first campaign was having a meet and greet and somebody came up to me and asked me a couple of questions where I stood and I answered and then you know after I answered said so how do you feel about that and we completely disagreed then they walked away and somebody came up to me later was like uh Mr. Clark you need to be more cavalier

I was like, what do you mean? You can't be that honest with people. Well, another story, my last campaign, I'm sitting down with a group that has no business supporting me on a lot of issues were completely different. And they asked me a few questions and I was just honest with them and they ended up supporting me and some of them helped me knock on doors and things like that. And the reason why was they called me after that meeting and said, heath, the reason why we're supporting you is because you were honest with us. And we know that if there's ever a time that you tell us you're gonna do something for us that you're gonna follow through with it, even though we disagree with you on some of those issues. So I just wanna encourage all of those two things. Always be willing to try to fight to see things from somebody else's perspective because it might help you in coming up with a better solution to a problem and be honest. With that, Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the will. Tonight. All right, thank you. Lets do that. Just a second. Yeah. I don't believe my heart is citing you right now. I don't believe that lipstick is more successful than you, Santa Claus. Not onlyを I yearn for more! Someday are you either, but try to guess, it's better let's go ahead. See ya. See ya later. Bye. Come on. Josia, you voted to join us this monday. meinen. You're not wrong. President Donald Trump will hire you where you're not is it money and money? Well, if you're not earning you give that money I don't know about you all, but have you ever seen four good reasons to go home like those? We're going to suspend just for a couple of moments for the people that may want to greet Chairman Clark. Okay, the House will come back to order. House will come back to order. We're going on now to the rules calendar. Clark will read the caption to Senate Bill 562. Senate Bill 562 by Senator Mollis of the 53rd, Guts of the 51st, hatch of the 50th and others to be titled an act to amend part one of Article 3 in Chapter 5 of Title 50. The district goes to Georgia and it's ended relating to General Authority duties and procedure the Department of Administrative Services, this bill having referred to the Committee on Governor Affairs, I committee recommends a dis bill do pass. Chair recognizes Representative Mom to hand to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the House. Over the last few weeks, we have all seen the atrocities committed by Russia and Ukraine. Thousands of citizens killed. Millions have fled their homes. Vladimir Putin contains to kill and destroy indiscriminately, leveling cities, destroying bomb shelters, even attacking a hospital. Even in the midst of all this, the courage of the Ukrainian people has been inspiring. Led by President Zaninsky, the Ukrainians are continuing to protect their homeland from a larger and better equipped invading force. And just a few weeks ago, this body voted on a resolution by our speaker, David Rostin, condemning Russia's unhaunted invasion of Ukraine with a unanimous roll call vote. There aren't many things everyone in this chamber votes for and agrees to, but we all voted to condemn Russia's invasion. Today, we have a chance to do more. The Constitution grants Washington the power to regulate our dereglings with foreign nations. But here in Georgia, we can address issues that haven't been addressed by Washington. Senate Bill 562 is Georgia's chance to implement our own embargo on goods from Russia and its allies and the Belarus. This legislation immense Georgia code to prohibit companies owned or operated by Russia or Belarus from bidding on or submitting a proposal for state contract. Those companies were basically significant fine, or twice the size of the contract for which the bid was submitted for submitting a file certification. I hope you'll stand with me and support our friends in Ukraine who, as I speak, are fighting for their freedom by supporting this legislation. And winning. And winning. You have a question if you care to yield. I would yield for one. Chair recognizes the representative gamble to your left for a question. Mr. Gentlemen, yield. I would yield. You think this is the way for the state of Georgia to help our friends in Ukraine? Well, that a down. It's like I said, right now, they're on the front lines. Their homes are being bombed by a very strong force coming. And this is an opportunity for us to support Ukraine in the best possible way. Well, that, Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the well. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, Chair recognizes the minority leader of the House, leader Beverly to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I had not planned on speaking to this bill. But the reality is, is that we all know as Martin Luther King said, and justice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are witnessing an unprecedented time in the course of human history as a representative of the minority party. I stand united with the Republican Party because we stand united as Americans right now in this moment. We see very clearly that in oppressed nation, which is the Ukrainian nation, is a threat to justice everywhere. What the Russians are doing is unconscionable in our moment in time and space. And so I gladly support this bill, SB 562. We stand united on this front. But again, injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. And we should take very seriously that the oppression of a nation, which I'm very familiar with, and we all are, is something we cannot and will not tolerate, as long as we are Americans. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and you're the well. Thank you, Mr. Leader. I just want to say before we vote that I am completely amazed by the bravery and courage of the Ukrainian nation. Nobody gave them a chance and they're driving the Russians back now. And I just think that's a great, great thing. All right. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of Senate bill 562 will vote I. Those opposed will vote no in the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of Senate bill 562. The eyes are 168. The nasor zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. What purpose does chairman England rise? I'm sorry. Chair recognizes chairman England. Miss Speaker, I move that this House insists on its version of House Bill 911 and appointed committee of conference. Chairman England has moved that this House insists on its position with regard to House Bill 911 and that a committee of conference be appointed to clerk or read the bill. Chair recognizes chairman England. Miss Speaker, I withdraw the motion to insist on a point and so therefore move that we disagree to the Senate substitute on House Bill 911. All right, we got a little ahead of ourselves. I thought we disagreed last week. I think goodness the clerk's office keeps up with these things. Chairman England has moved that this House disagreed to the Senate substitute to House Bill 911 and the clerk will read the caption. House Bill 911 to be entitled an act to make and provide appropriations for the state fiscal year beginning July 1st, 2022 and ending June 30th, 2023. Chair recognizes chairman England to explain the Senate substitute and his motion. Miss Speaker, I just I guess assume that when they send it back we just automatically disagreed with what they did. But anyway, ladies and gentlemen, this is just the first step in moving to a conference committee for the FY23 budget. On the gentleman's motion, this House disagreed to the Senate substitute to House Bill 911. Is there any objection? Is there objection? The chair here is none and this House has disagreed to the Senate substitute to House Bill 911. Clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 588. Senate Bill 588. My senator Miller, the 49th Albright is the 56th, and at a bar today, the 31st and others being titled an act to amend Article 3, Chapter 2, Title 20. The official go to Georgia annotated relating to local boards of education. So provide that all meeting of local boards education shall be open to the public. This bill then refer to the committee on education. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Rich to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House. Senate Bill 588 pertains to the public meetings of local school boards. It recognizes the importance of parents voices in their children's education. As a parent, I have always been keenly aware that my children during school spend, during the school year spend more of their waking hours under the care, direction, and instruction of their teachers and administrators than they do with me. It's important that we protect our parents voices and what happens in that school building. So Senate Bill 588 requires that local boards of education publish the notice of their regular monthly meetings on their principal public website in a prominent place so that parents will have adequate notice of when those meetings are taking place and so that their voices can be heard. The bill also requires that local boards of education adopt rules of conduct for their public hearings and that local boards publish those rules of conduct also in a prominent manner on their websites. The rules must contemplate for the removal of individuals from local board meetings for actual disruptions, not merely disagreeing with the points of view that the parents are espousing. This bill does not limit the ability of law enforcement to enforce the law should someone act in a manner inconsistent with Georgia law and the bill pertains only to public meetings. Not meetings of the executive session that the board may have to take from time to time. This bill strengthens our parents access to local board of education meetings and better informs our parents about when the meetings are to take place and the conduct that is expected of members of the public at these meetings. This bill respects local control because the local school boards will be the ones to develop these rules. Mr. Speaker, I will stand for any questions. You have a number of questions if you care to you. I will. Chair recognizes representative Walenski. Do you allow for a question? Does the representative yield? Yes, I do. Thank you. I just want to say that I like this bill. Thank you so much. I just wanted to state you know, I spoke out against HB1 and maybe changes can be made to allow or I say wouldn't it be good if the school school's colleges could have the same ability here to insert situations limit people who are speaking in ways that are against rules. So maybe the schools could create rules to have some limit on the speech on campus. I hope that made sense. Thank you. Thank you for your comment. Do you further you? No, Mr. Speaker, I will yield the well and I will ask for every member's favorable consideration in favor of our parents. Thank you. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does representative park rise? Partly mentioned inquiry. The chair here is not sure that this bill does not do anything that current law does not already require. Well, I don't think that is the case but every member is going to be free to make that determination. What purpose does the speaker pro-tem of the house rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not true that if we pass this bill for the first time in Georgia history local boards of education will be required to provide some public comment period the app portioning of which the chairperson will decide and is it not further true that for the first time the local boards of education will publish the meetings on their website instead of merely once a year in the local legal organ and is it not further true that for the first time in Georgia history the local boards of education will publish the rules of conduct such that parents will know what is and what is not permitted is that not true? That's the chair's understanding of the bill. What purpose does representative McLaren rise? Parliamentary inquiry. The speaker is not true that this election year the majority party would have been able to message distrust for public schools sufficiently with only one or two of the bills that y'all passed and you don't need four or five of them. Good sound by, chair representative. One more what purpose does chairman rich rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Isn't it true Mr. Speaker that this bill emphasizes our trust and our parents to have a voice in their own children's education and has nothing to do with distrust of public education? That would be the chair's interpretation. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of Senate bill 588. The eyes are 129 the nasa 41. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. What purpose does chairman England rise? To make a motion. State your motion. I move that this House immediately transmit House bill 911 back to the Senate. Chairman England has moved this House bill 911 that was the budget. The immediately transmitted back to the Senate is their objection. Is their objection? The chair here is none and it is so ordered. All right we're going to divert just for a minute.

away from the rules calendar to do something that is history-making. I don't think in my 12 years I have allowed a member of the State Senate to speak from this podium and I don't recall one speaking before, but a real institution in the Senate is leaving us after the end of this year and I know he had the first of many farewell parties last week and others planned I think throughout this week, but I thought it would be appropriate, particularly since he is still the rules chairman of the Senate. I need to talk to you about a couple of measures to before you leave to recognize someone who has been a friend to all of us during his tenure in the Senate and particularly as chairman of the rules committee and a dear, dear friend of mine. Please welcome to this podium the chairman of the Senate rules committee, Chairman Jeff Mollis. Thank you. Thank you so much Mr. Speaker. You can have anything you want. I promise, ladies and gentlemen, I am humbled and I doubt that I'll make it through this, but I want to thank you for such an incredible journey that I've had and for you to be a part of it. You have inspired me, you have been a part of my life. Those of you that's been here before me and early when I got here 22 years ago, I am just at awe of all the relationships that we've made together and all the things that we've done together. Now I'm going to mention a few folks from the past and currently and please forgive me if I don't say your name, but I love each and every one of you and I've had such a great ride and I'm not going to take but just a few minutes, not long at all. But when I first got here, Calvin Smiley was the rules chair and I did pass a bill while he was rules chair and I am grateful. He was good to me when he didn't have to be and I think that says a lot for everybody that works together in here and I hope we continue to do that after I long gone. But people like Terry Coleman, Butch Parish, Al Williams, Ron Stevens, Larry Walker, Jr., Lynn Westbrook, leader Burns, Alan Powell, who's very quiet and shy and I've learned some words that I didn't use much but I use them often now. Thank you, Mr. Powell. Matt Hatchet, who was my roommate and I'm not going to tell you all the stories I know about my Hatchet but we were two big dispensers who had the ladle together and I'm and I would say one time Mr. Speaker, you know how nauseous he said, now look I've got a big big SUV if you and Matt need to use that to go get groceries. Now I'm not sure what he meant by that and my good friend Richard Smith and the late Johnny Metta's and J. Powell, what remarkable people they were for me to get to know. Terry England because I always have something in the budget and I love him. I love him dearly, especially now Terry. And I can't, I've got to mention my group of guys that we work well together. Steve Tarvan used to be Jay Neal then Mark Snow for you remember, may remember him. Duane Hill, you know, Mark was always talking about his mom and I talk about my late mom and now too. Mike Cameron, Eddie Lumpston and the course leader Beverly enjoy working with him. Bill Riley and Vance Smith, we've been places together we're not going to talk about right Vance. But more than that, Speaker Austin, I met him on the road long ago when we were both running for office and he mentored me back then and I was an unknown. But I have been blessed by knowing Speaker Austin and all the kindness that he's given me and it's given many of us. This job is all about relationships and I have learned that the ones I have here in this body are so dear to me. I will never forget him. I will never forget you. I will never stop remembering the days that we work together to make Georgia better and I'm a better person for it. So as I leave today and I'm still rural chairman to the end of the year, if I can be a service to you, please let me know and please keep working together because I know Georgia's better days or ahead of us as we all work together to get there. So thank you very much. God bless you and thank you, Miss Speaker. Clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 87. Senate Bill 87, I said it red of the third miller of the 49th, but the 55th and others to be entitled back to amend Article 3, Chapter 7, Title 48, the fish go to Georgia, Antiterlain, tax returns and furnishing of information because to authorize Georgia taxpayers to make certain voluntary contributions through the income tax payment and refund processes. Bill Evernford, the committee on ways and means that committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes the majority leader of the House to present the bill. Thank you, Miss Speaker. And thanks to Senator Mullis, we certainly do appreciate him and his service to our state as he's worked with us here. Today colleagues, I want to bring you SB 87. I believe this proposition gives us a chance to stand by one of the founding principles of our state. And that's leaving not for oneself but for others. SB 87 sponsored by Senator Rhett and improved by Chairman Shaw Blackman. It's been a long process to get this bill across the finish line. This bill allows all Georgians who file income taxes to make a voluntary contribution or of a portion of any tax refund due to the taxpayer. By authorizing a reduction in the refund check otherwise payable to the taxpayer. You can reduce the refund that you would normally get back and designated it to go to a purpose. Annually, the Department of Revenue will transmit such amounts to the technical college system of Georgia Foundation, which is a 501C3 corporation. Now, these dollars, the amount that has been designated will go back to the Department of Revenue will be used exclusively, exclusively to award scholarship to veterans with service-connected disabilities, or attending a TCSG institution. That's a really great part of this bill, but here's another great part, a really good part. You know, I think we all know that the story seldom told as soon forgotten. This act, because of the diligence and the devotion of this act and this effort, shall be known as the Senator Jack Hill Veterans Act. Senator Hill, a friend, to many of us serving in here today, and I mentor to many of us, including our beloved and respected Appropriations Chair, Terry England. Senator Hill served in this General Assembly for over 30 years. Senator Hill served our country as an outstanding member of the Georgia Air Guard for over 33 years. I believe it is only right to honor our veterans who have sacrificed so much for this country by promoting this voluntary contribution. No less to honor the legacy of a man who truly was altruistic, who was an altruistic person, who gave freely to his fellow men. Mr. Speaker, that's what this bill does. I would ask for this body to favor, favorably consider Senate Bill 87. I would yield for a question, if there are any. You have a question if you care to yield. I would yield for one, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes Chairman England to your right for a question. Mr. Chairman, yield certainly do. Well more of a comment than a question. I just want to thank you for shifting this bill through the process and of course naming it the Jack Hill Veterans Act. As we know, Jack served with distinction not only in this body, but in our nation's military and I think it's fitting that this goes to honor his legacy and goes to honor something he was passionate about and that was furthering education for all individuals across the state. So thank you very much. Thank you for those comments, Chairman England, and I certainly understand that all of you may not have the opportunity to know Senator Hill personally. But very much appreciate the work that Chairman England has done this year and in years previously on the budget knowing that part of that direction and that mentorship came from Senator Hill.
