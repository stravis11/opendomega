TRANSCRIPT
----------
this house will come to order. House will come to order. Now we're done. We'll begin our day with our devotion and pledge.
For a devotion today, I'm going to read the 23rd Psalm.
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
He makeeth me to lie down in green pastures.
He leadeth me beside the still waters.
He restoreeth my soul.
leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
Ye, though, I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for
thou art with me, thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
Thou prepares a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, thou anointest my head with
all my cup runth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life
and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Amen.
If you'll join me in the pledge, please.
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for
which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible with liberty and justice for all.
We are going to dispense with the roll call today.
We have no items of business other than a second reading
on the calendar.
Second reading of bills and resolutions,
the clerk will read.
Senate Bill 2EX by Senator Kennedy of the 18th Council to the 46th.
Duggan of the 30th, good to the 51st, Burke of the 11th and others.
Bill to provide for the composition a number of congressional districts, three-second readers.
That completes our second readers.
There are no reports of standing committees, no warning orders.
The clerk will read the caption to a group of privileged resolutions.
Honoring the life and memory of Michael Langford, recognizing November 14, 2021 as African Methodist
Episcopal Church 6 District Alzheimer's Awareness Purpose Sunday and for other purposes
that completes the reading of the privilege resolutions.
Is there any objection to the adoption of the privilege resolutions?
The chair here is none and the resolutions are adopted.
House Monday in recess until 1 p.m. this afternoon, at which time we will stand adjourned until
Monday, November 22 at 10 a.m. Let the record reflect that the highest ranking position
here today other than I guess the chair is the minority leader of the house.
Those of you who have come in, thank you very much, enjoy the rest of your weekend.
