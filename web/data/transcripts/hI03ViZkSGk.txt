TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good morning. This is the subcommittee on transportation appropriations meeting jointly with the transportation policy committee.
So appreciate everybody being here. Feel free committee members to move up to the front with the packets right on the table.
If you don't have one in front of you there on the first three rows or first two rows, it looks like appreciate our staff.
David and Danny, getting those, making those available to all of us, and like I said,
I'm John LaHood, Chair of the Subcommittee on Appropriations.
Good to be with you. We're going to hear presentations today from the DOT and CERDA, and I've got
Chairman Rick Jasper's with us, and I want to ask him to, if he has any remarks.
Just real quick, thank you members for being here so early.
Thank you, Chairman of the hood, for putting us together.
I'm able to help Russell, Janine, with their time,
not have to come to another committee meeting.
Go ahead and knock this out.
I just want to recognize, we have a DOT board member,
Joe Stein, from Versailles County.
Joe, you can stand up so they can see
and welcome you if you'd be in here today.
And members, I want to also recognize Danny Nichols.
Danny's right down here on the end.
You can stand up so I can see you.
You know, she's our policy analyst, you know, this year,
and we're glad to have her.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Back to you.
Thank you, Chairman.
Thank you, Chairman.
I second what Chairman Jasper has said.
You know, we lost Abbey Day, who has been here for...
for it. I had to call her out. She was a wealth of knowledge to me as my first year in this
role last year, but Danny and David have really picked the ball up and I don't think we
skipped a beat. Obviously you prepared us all very well, so thank you. We will go ahead
and get started. We have an hour. We're already seven minutes into it because rules is meeting
here at nine. So Commissioner McMurray, if you'll go ahead and come up and present your
show us your presentation.
To both Chairman, thank you for combining this. We do appreciate that. Nothing like efficiency.
So thank you all for pulling this together. But I do want to take a point of privilege just
for a minute to thank the women and men of GDOT and of all state government. In fact, for the
work that's been going on since last Thursday to Friday, where we started getting
ready for this winter weather and they did a fantastic job, dedication and
commitment of the men and women of Gidas, outstanding. We had people that left
home on Friday morning and some of those are just going back home today. So we
bring you up our crews from Tifton and Jessup districts anytime there's a
of winter weather event across Metro Atlanta. They come up and they're actually, you know,
brining and plowing. The interstates here in Metro Atlanta and our other districts work
our way north. So they did a fantastic job. I've yet to get to final numbers, but we put
over two million gallons of brine out. And at one point we were about 3,500 tons of
salt 2500 tons of aggregate spread and again 12 continual 12 hour shifts this
morning and they're still I believe as of the report I had this morning I think
seven state routes that are still closed at some point those hardest hit
counties still Habersham white union towns Ravens sort of that north east
Georgia corner we call it the Golden Triangle from where I'm from a beautiful
place, but still dealing with that, power lines, trees and power lines, but working to
get those roads open.
And also a big shout out to our GEMA team who leads that there's a quarterback, GEMA
for leading this and the Department of Natural Resources and Georgia Forestry Commission
for their chainsaw strike teams.
They've been working very hard to get the trees out of the road so we can get the roads
cleared out.
So just wanted to acknowledge that.
What I want to do today is walk you through some important data points relating to transportation
and the cost to do in business because we really need to understand those costs as it
informs us in the budgeting process and I want to also share some of the outputs and some
of the outcomes from a couple of two budget years, the current budget year and last budget
year to show you how we're deploying the resources that you have afforded us when you
approve the budgets and then finally I'll just jump into this budget, this
amended budget year FY26 and when I spoke here to joint appropriations I talked
about acknowledging some realities so one of the realities I need to acknowledge
is what's happening on the federal front because the federal funding to
Georgia DOT is still very important at somewhere around 1.5 to 1.6 billion
billion dollars a year. And we all know that the federal budget year begins on October
1st and I think everybody is aware at the federal level that we're operating under a
continuing resolution to January 30th. When we work under continuing resolutions federally,
the way it happens, the way the money flows from the federal government is they give you
a daily pro-rata share of your total budgeted amount.
And so you get 1,365th share for the days
to get us through January 30th.
Well, that's really not a way to run a business
because when we do a project,
we need to fully fund a project.
I can't daily give a daily pro-rata share to a project.
Now, I think everybody has seen at Congress
last week the house passed a mini bus
that had four big budget programs in it.
And that included the U.S. Department of Transportation
which has the federal funding in it.
That did pass the house.
I think you've seen the headlines recently.
The Senate seems to maybe want to decouple
one of those budget programs out of that minibus
that's passed.
And so I'm not sure what that means,
but it means we're getting really close
to September, I mean to January 30.
And if it doesn't happen, then they're potentially again
a government shutdown or the stop of money.
So we're watching that very closely.
The other thing we do every year is the federal government
allows you to do a IOU.
And so basically, you can pay it forward with a Georgia dollar
and when the federal budget passes,
the federal government will reimburse you
for the money that you expend it.
They approve everything along the way except the money.
They just say, here's an OU.
And when we get to this point of the calendar year,
we pay it forward to keep projects moving.
We want to keep projects moving as fast as we can
and not delay projects.
But we're using our state budget to do that.
And at this point of the year, we've
used and consumed our state budget, which should be federal,
and our state budget to do state funded projects.
So we're about to, we don't want to get ahead of our skis
and expend all our money waiting on the federal dollar.
So it gets to be a tricky point of delivery.
Very complicated budgeting process,
certainly a accounting process,
but just wanted to highlight that
because if there's a shutdown at this point
or this gets delayed more,
it will impact our ability to advance projects,
either design right away,
and certainly for construction phases
on federally funded projects.
So if that's not good news enough on this next slide,
I'm going to take you a deep dive early in the morning
and into a chart here that I've shown both the subcommittee
and the transportation committee over the last few years.
And it's really the inflationary cost related to transportation.
So this chart, this complicated chart
comes from Federal Highway Administration.
And the red line tracks actually the cost
doing business from around the nation for highway construction. So they index the cost of highway
construction from actual bid data from every state. And so you can see that's the red line.
And since 2021 it's increased to by about 70%. So the index has gone up 70%. So you can say there's
70% more on average across the nation than it did in 2021.
The CPI that we're all everybody knows about and understands is that blue line.
So I think it's pretty staggering when you see what CPI is doing compared to what the
cost of construction is.
The other index here is the dashed sort of yellow line across the bottom sort of gold,
maybe sort of orangey.
that's the employment cost index. So that's another index of the cost of
employment. And then the green line is called the producer price index, which is a
key indicator for inflation based on the production of level of goods like
from mining, manufacturing, and ag as well. So those are again or sort of the
indicator. But what's interesting about this is, as you can see that the red
line, the highway construction cost index outpaced all those others, especially
from about 2022 on. So what does that mean locally here in Georgia? We're probably
a little better than average on a few things and worse than average that red
line on some and let me just talk through a couple of those. This chart looks
back to FY21 to FY25 and just simple resurfacing a two-way road has
increased in cost by 51%. So right now to do a two-lane road, it's about $251,000 a mile
to do two lanes, one lane in each direction. Widening from two lanes to four lanes,
either if it's urban or in a rule setting, our actual blow bid pricing has increased 99%
for urban and about 90% for rural widening. So basically double, practically doubled in cost
over those last four budget years.
Aroundabouts, we talked about roundabouts,
Jeremy Powell and I were just talking about roundabouts,
you can see that they've increased about 47%.
And we just, we compare that to the paved surface.
So, you know, over those last four years.
In bridges, bridges are important to everybody.
I'm gonna talk more about bridges.
Bridge replacements increase by about 93%.
So, you can just see in those four years
this really increased cost.
Down at the bottom of the small table at the bottom
is some of the breakouts of the components
of these projects, such as asphalt, aggregate,
storm drain pops, bridge beams, and guardrail.
And you can see they range from 90% on pops and things
like that to a low of about 35% for guardrail metal.
And that number actually has come down.
Still, still prices were really high back at the beginning
after COVID, and they have retreated some back.
So again, I'll just show you this to show you, as we think about budget,
is how far does the money go?
What are we using it for?
You can sort of see the realities of that.
This next chart, as we took that red line from that first chart,
I showed you, and then index the budget, our state budget,
compared over that same time frame.
And it's no surprise, but basically what I told you is,
construction costs have gone here, and our budget has increased.
Thank goodness for that, over the years.
So the inflation nationally is increased
by for construction about 70%, our budget about 30%,
so that gives you the difference of the loss of buying power,
if you will, to do what we need to do.
So what does this really mean and translate?
And I showed this at joint appropriations
and Janine Miller's here, who you'll hear from in a little bit,
but working through the planning process in her role
as the planning director, we have to live
a four-year, physically constrained budget process of physical constraint versus
projects. So when project costs go up, what happens is we have to take a project
and move it from the current year it's in to a neck to the next year is usually
what we do. And then when you do that, you just push another project out of the
next year because you were already constrained, physically constrained, that line
across the middle of those boxes is physical constraint. So this increase cost is
just calls us to cascade projects out and I sort of joked around it during
appropriation saying I'm pretty sure each of your projects the most
important project in the state in your district more so than your counterpart
next to you so y'all can debate that later but I got a fill in your projects
number one so it's never fun when we have to come say you tell you that well
we're having to shift your project out or year or two and simply because of the
funding situation of these increase cost with even again increase revenue at
the state level federal levels the whole another story I won't get into at
this moment but that's sort of the process we have to go through which is never
fun and of course anything we can do to advance projects sooner than later
now here's the good news story I want to go back because again with a sincere
thank you to both the House and the Senate and the governor's budget the last
two years with the state general fund infusion in amended $24 of $1.5 billion in $1 billion last
year as amended budget. You can see now that our budget line went above the national highway
construction cost index for the last two, which means we're we didn't lose ground that we
actually maybe gained a little bit of ground on these last two budget years. But the difference
between there on 2020 to about 2023 where we're below means we still have more projects
ready to go than we have budget for. But I just can't say enough about those last two
budget years for leadership from the House, Senate and the governor to put that money in
the budget to do what it's going to do. So let me show you what that money's done. Again,
trying to set the table as we look forward on the on the amended 26 budget. We look back at those
was amended budgets 24 and 25 and this is where the money went.
98 million dollars went to airport aid.
We always have about three times more request
than we have funding for airport aid.
And so this was a big, big step.
About half of that money,
they went to a replacement airport
down in Griffin, Spalding County.
That if we did not have the money,
the Federal Aviation Administration
was gonna take back their commitment of funding,
which was a big part of that.
So we were able to get, secure that FAA funding
and leverage those state dollars
and also do a tremendous amount of work
around our local airports across the state.
The local roads funding is that money to cities and counties,
that's El Miglac that most of you are familiar with,
El Miglac money, we send this money out by formula
to cities and counties based on population in road miles,
$250 million and $265 million respectively,
which basically doubled their LMIG amount.
And again, putting it into this budget category
called local roads admin,
took away the match component
because LMIG has a statutory match component
either 10% if you're in a tier region,
which many of you are in.
And if you're not in a tier region, it was a 30%.
But that local roads admin did not require match.
We got that money out very quickly in both years.
And most all that money was used
by cities and counties for resurfacing.
Again, state of good repair.
their reality has been the same as ours increased
paid in cost.
The next bucket there is the freight program,
which is a big program at 500 million each year,
which was a new program that was stood up
just a couple of budget years ago,
coming out of the freight and logistics plan that we did,
which came through the Chairman Jasper's Committee,
and basically moved forward to establish
a new freight budget program for us.
I'm gonna come back to that one in a moment.
The next is the capital construction, 593 was an amended 24 to address the very thing
I just showed you, where we had to cascade projects out into the future because we didn't
have money.
In fact, out of that $593 million, we were able to advance 44 projects, 25 of those
projects, the 44 were ones that were just delayed, they were ready to go, we just needed
the money.
And in fact, when we did those 25 projects from where they were budgeted,
we sped them up by 40 project years.
So if a project was sitting in two physical years out and we moved it in,
we call that two project years.
So 25 projects accelerate it by 40 project years, which is amazing.
And we know the longer you wait, the more it costs as well.
And we also added 19 project phases that we know we need it to be working on,
but we just didn't have money to get started.
So that's where that money went.
Capital maintenance was 50 million and amended 24
to address that resurfacing numbers.
I was telling you about it being 51% more.
So that helped us there.
And last and very importantly, as I'll talk about
Representative Taylor just a minute ago,
the 200 million for Hurricane Helene and Debbie cleanup
and the storms we had in Southeast Georgia
went into our maintenance budget.
And without that money, we would absolutely have been
devastated in Hurricane cleanup.
In fact, still, I dealt with a talk to Columbia County
this yesterday where we had a request from Columbia County
still dealing with those impacts or those costs
that are still out there.
And as I told you on appropriations so far,
we've had about $48 million from FEMA reimbursement.
And so here we are, a year and a half or so,
post that and still working on reimbursement.
So this money was very, very important.
Now, that's what you appropriate,
and that's where we're gonna use it.
Let me show you how it's been utilized.
The maintenance money, this is expended.
So these are dollars in and actually paid out to contractors.
100% of that money's been done.
The capital construction, that 593, 69% of that outlay
has gone out, meaning work has been done.
And then the last two categories are the freight,
that 500 million in each year.
As you can see, those numbers are sort of lagging a little behind, but there's a reason
for that.
Again, that was a new budget program, and we're advancing a lot of projects there that
were freight ready, and then several of the big ones on the next slide, or what I call
the big three out of that, are projects that we will bid this calendar year.
So these projects will come to bid this calendar year.
The first one is I-16, which is roughly $516 million, which is a combination of
of amended 24 funds and amended 25 funds
to widen 31 miles of I-16 from I-95 there
down in Savannah, at least up to the Hyundai Meta Plant.
Our goal is to do a variable,
a fixed-price variable scope contracting.
So we say this is how much money we have
and the contractor bids how far they can go.
So a very innovative way to try to make sure
we maximize these dollars.
As we all know, I-16 has tremendous amount of trucks,
23% trucks in that area.
And we know adding this third lane down there
will reduce delay by about 56% now and in the future.
So again, very important for our economic opportunity
that comes out of the port and everything is moving,
that freight moving up I-16.
So that's one project.
The next one is I-95, $74 million
to Y995 from I-16 to South Carolina.
South Carolina is currently under construction
to build eight lanes on their side.
We have six lanes on the Georgia side.
So we're sinking those up.
Again, with traffic volumes down there,
they'll continue to expand and grow
due to all the freight commerce that comes out of the port.
And lastly, out of the big three is 135 million
to complete the last segment of State Route 96,
which is that connection from I-75 to I-16 South of Macon.
There in Houston and Twigs County,
we have this project ready to bid.
It's about nine miles with a major river crossing
in there too, so those are sort of the big three
that consume most of that freight budget.
That's why those numbers are lagging a little further behind,
but you can see that this calendar year
will be getting that work out the door
and seeing those dollars used.
Now, Mr. Chairman, let me get into the mended 26 budget
from the governor's recommendation.
And again, I'm super excited and very grateful
for the governor putting in roughly $2.3 billion
of additional state general fund money
into the G.DOT budget.
And so let me walk through sort of the big buckets
or where that's going, starting with $100 million
to address rural bridge replacements.
And so we have literally, you know,
hundreds of millions if not more bridge projects
that we know we need to do,
but we don't have the funding to do.
And so this $100 million is gonna be used strategically
to support ag and timber industry
in the rural parts of the state.
So we're going through the process now
of doing a triage of where are these bridges?
We're trying to make sure they're tied directly
to some ag production or some timber facility production
that we're replacing bridges strategically.
So it's taking us a little bit of time.
I know I wish I could give you the list
of what that is today, but we're working through that
because we're doing several SIVs and analysis
to say, okay, what does this one serve?
What's this bridge?
So this will be a combination of county bridges
and state route bridges, but really try to again,
strategically advance those and our goal would be
that we would deploy these bridges
either in this budget year or next budget year to be bid.
Not put them all out one time,
but make sure we could be strategic
about getting these bridges $100 million
of strategic bridge investment out
over this budget year and next.
Next was $200 million to the 316 corridor.
For the last six to seven years,
we've been really focused on trying to improve safety
along state route 316 in Gwinnett,
Barrow in Oconi counties, roughly 40 some odd miles between Athens and sort of Metro,
Atlanta there in Gwinnett.
What we've been doing is trying to address the safety concerns that exist.
I'll get into that by replacing intersections that have traffic lots with either interchanges
or overpasses or making some kind of other access improvements along this very critical
corridor.
And our focus at first was where the traffic signals are because that's where the most
congestion is, that's where you have a lot of crashes, and so we've been underway.
And on this next slide, you can sort of see all the intersections from left to right,
32-some-odd intersections along 316, where the traffic really varies greatly from about
almost 30,000 vehicles per day up to 108,000 vehicles per day with 12% of those being trucked.
So it is a freight corridor, but the staggering number here is there's about 1,300 crashes
per year on this segment.
In our 10 years of data, we went back 10 years,
so there's been 65 fatal crashes on this corridor
in the last 10 years.
If you do that math, that's six and a half per year,
that is not where we want to be.
In fact, the crash rates, we look at rates,
so that sort of equalizes things around the state.
Six of the intersections are in the top 50,
worst offensive intersections for crashes,
and three more are in the top 100.
So you got nine out of the top 100 worst intersection locations on this core door, and the other
thing we look at is crash severity.
So you have a crash, how bad is it?
So the most severe crashes, the ones you don't want to have for the intersections are higher
than the statewide average, and one is double the statewide average.
So you can see the crash issue we're dealing with from a safety point of view.
The good news is 18 of those intersections are actively being addressed or have been
But this last $200 million, this $200 million will go a long way to continue sort of the 12 to 13 remaining intersections that we just really didn't have funding for.
If you look down at the bottom right for the legend, I know it may be hard to see, you have yet sort of the yellow is intermediate and long term.
The yellow intermediate means that we may have light design underway, but we didn't have construction funding or ride away.
The black is long term meaning it's just not funded so you count those up
There's I think 12 or 13 of those that this $200 million will absolutely allow us to start addressing
So we end up with a core the entire corridor that is not only improve safety
But also mobility in a growing area especially in the Barrow and O'Coney County areas
Next out of the state general fund and the governor's budget was the $250 million of local roads administration again that L
big lock Monday. I can absolutely tell you that I've heard from ACCG and GMA. They're
fully supportive of this, cities and counties. And I've had no city or county complain about
this money by the way. So I think you got unanimous consent that everybody locks the cities
and counties. Again, they're facing the same realities we face with increased costs.
And the other thing is we get this money out very quickly. We would open, we would open the portal
is probably as soon as the budget is passed and then shut it off right before
GUI-1 so that the money is committed in this physical year in the cities and
counties that can have use use of it immediately all right next this is a really
big one I shared this same slide at joint appropriations these are state
general fund money that is listed under our budget item payments to SIRTA
you're gonna hear from Janine Miller the executive director of SIRTA in just a
little bit who will provide a lot more detail about some of the data points on
I-75 South Express lanes. But what I can say about this is just probably been the
most popular budget item that I've heard about from many of you and many of my
friends from the announcement the governor made at eggs and issues. It appears
that everyone is really a big fan of this project because I do think it has
such statewide in fact it affects everybody if you live south or north it affects you one way or
another you know I asked during joint appropriations did everybody did anyone ever think the express
lanes were going in the wrong direction and it got a pretty big chuckle so I'm assuming that meant
yes but what I can tell you when the direction that they're going in most people criticize us saying
those lanes don't look like they should be going the other way well when you open up two more
lanes where it's two lanes wide, you add at 67% more capacity, which then makes the normal
lanes look more empty than they were because that's the benefit of having those two additional
lanes. So it's amazing to see the difference and they are always going the wrong direction
from you if you're going the direction when they're not open, correct? And oh, by the way,
It does take us some time to reverse them.
It takes an hour or two to go through to make sure there's nobody in them, make sure it's
safe, and then you have to flip them around.
So that's something we have to deal with.
Well this funding absolutely does some critical things that says on this slide.
It's going to, one, we're going to get rid of the directional, the, we're reversible lanes
and make two lanes barrier-separated, mind you, meaning there's a concrete barrier between
you and the other lanes, the entire 12 miles, that's foundationally what this money is going
to do, which gives us the money to do the design work that we have to do, to do the right-away
acquisition that we have to do, the environmental work that we have to do, this will be a federal
environmental document.
And then it's going to go to help support the overall construction cost, which will still
need a form of finance and through SIRTA. And that form of finance can come in many
forums. It can come through the USDOT Tiffy alone. It can come from toll revenue bonds.
But it's going to take more money to do this and to get that objective of two lanes
in each direction. Not only that, Chairman Hatchett asked, well, how far will these go?
I'm not sure I answered appropriately.
I said, Dublin's probably a good place,
but the point is, I think you all know that you get stuck.
If you're coming north, you get stuck down in Locust Grove
at Bill Gardner Parkway.
That's where traffic stops.
And so we know that we need to go further south
with these express lanes.
So this amount of money is what we need as a minimum
to make sure that we can leverage to do two lanes
in each direction in the 12 miles,
but also like I mentioned on I-16,
we'll make it very innovative
that we're gonna make sure the money goes
as far south as possible to try to, again,
because we know you're stopping
before you even have the opportunity
to get in the express lane.
So that's gonna be our,
that's gonna be our tact and strategy to do that.
So just again,
did you need, we'll have a lot more data points
about how the system operates today
and sort of the data behind it.
And we can talk about that one a little bit more
after she does her presentations.
Now let me just jump into the budget itself.
So you've got your track sheet in front of you.
But before you get there, if you pull that track sheet up,
you're going to see the total back on page three
of the Mendit budget.
And so I always want to remind everybody
in the Mendit budget year, the $71.6 million
increase in exercise comes from the audit collections from last year's motor fuel collection.
So that gets into our mended budget. So motor fuel is forecast but then adjusted in the
minute year for the actual audit collections from Department of Revenue that comes into
us. That's why there's no change in transportation trust fund fees or the transit trust fund
fees in the mended budget. Those two budget items look back two years. It takes two year
look back is what we get appropriated in the year. So those would be an
adjustment next year. In the state general funds, $2.3 billion, I just
highlight it the biggest part of that. But that shows you that brings our total
budget to $5.2 billion. Again, very thankful for that state general
fund money. This table is sort of a summary of what's on your track sheet.
We've aggregated a couple of those budget programs together to show you
where the funding is actually used. And so I always like to show this chart,
Of course, the payments to SIRTA is the big one there.
1.8, there's a few other things in payments to SIRTA
beside the 1.7, 9.6 billion.
Then capital projects, capital construction
and capital maintenance at 1.77 billion dollars.
Then you have our routine maintenance budget.
That is, hey, that's snowing ice right now,
but a preparation and response,
but that's the taking care of the roadside.
I always say that's the taking care of the house,
if you will, of doing that, including a lot of maintenance contracting.
That's our staff, but also tremendous amount of maintenance contracting to do what we need
to do.
Then you can see the LMIG and LRA combine there, and then our general operations of the
department, which in this case we've aggregated many budget programs together, like department
admin, traffic operations, program delivery administration, planning, and data collection.
So that sort of run through the department altogether, there is some of the traffic operations
that do things.
We have bond debt, I'll talk about in a minute, we have our intermodal, which is aviation
rail waterways and aviation rail waterways transit.
So that's where that money is, and then pavements to the ETL.
So on the next slide, if you want to get your track sheet, we've just taken your track
sheet and put it in a tabular format here for the presentation.
Again, I'm going to start by saying a big thank you to the governor for recognizing the
one-time payment of $2,000 for state employees.
We certainly appreciate that.
I'm not going to go line through line on those items, but that total is about $8.6 million
to GDOT across all the budget programs where people are, and that is so appreciated.
We really do appreciate that.
So let me start at the top of this table, and I'm just going to highlight a few things.
The Geobond debt, I think it's really important to talk about.
The good news is you can see that was about $1.1 million reduction in bond debt, meaning
that our debt is reduced for geo bond debt, but our total debt from various kind of bonds
is still $1.13 billion.
So we still have a pretty good credit card balance there that we're paying down from
previous bond packages.
I just want to make sure you're aware of that.
Next is capital construction.
I'm going to highlight that one because again, that's where, that's where things
get built. That increased excise number that you saw in the last slide. We put 36.9 million
of that into the capital construction and then the other plus up was to 200 million in
state general fund money for 316. So that increased that $266 million ad that circle.
The next circle there is a capital maintenance which is line 47.3 on your track sheet. In
the capital maintenance, there's the $100 million
added for the bridge replacements,
rural bridge replacements I talked about.
We'd ask for your support to actually get that
in budget alignment with the capital construction program.
So if we could shift that up into capital construction
program, that would be an alignment
with the budget requirements there.
And then that was the big change there,
where we put that into capital maintenance.
Going down to Elmig, Elmig is a minimum of 10% of the excise tax.
So with the increased excise for motor fuel collections,
we made that $7 million adjustment to the Elmig program.
And then of course the big circle there is local roads admin
that I've already talked about at $250 million.
If you want to jump on your track sheet over to line 4712 or so, then you can see routine
maintenance.
I want to talk about that again, very important taking care of the house, as I said.
We increased, took some of the excise, 21.8 million of the excise, we added in the routine
maintenance just to deal with the increased cost.
Those increased costs on construction go right into maintenance, it's the same materials.
And also to help with some of our equipment, keeping our equipment up to date as it ages
out.
And so that's where that's going and plus some money for the $2,000 supplement.
So that gives us the $26 million ad in routine maintenance.
Lastly, circle there's payments to SIRTA that we talked about as relates to the I-75
South express lanes.
So with that, both Chairman, thank you for this opportunity.
Again, I want to thank Governor Kemp for his continued third year in a row for leadership
of increasing the transportation investment that absolutely keeps George in moving ahead,
trying to keep our stance of the number one state to do business going on the 13th, trying
to go for the 13th year in a row and this additional funding actually will make lives
better for George in all across this vast state, not just in Metro, Atlanta, but across
the entire state.
So with that, be glad to entertain any questions at your pleasure.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Very thorough report.
And appreciate you stewarding these resources for the state and keeping us safe on the road.
And $2.4 billion added to your amended budget, that's a lot.
And most of it looks like it's going to the express lanes.
And we're a little bit tight on time, so we're going to be brief on the questions and just
to ask you to be available to the committee, you know,
yes sir, afterwards.
But if you could just explain, you know, briefly,
the express line, the original project, when was that?
When was the speech, the express lines put in
and how does it relate to today's, this new project?
Yeah, so thanks for that question.
It was bid in 2013 and opened in 2018.
It seems like yesterday, but it's been a minute,
so going on eight years this summer, being open.
The original cost was pretty good bargain,
it was about $216 million, sort of all in,
but I remind you that what we had then was a median
that we basically filled in,
and there was only a couple of over,
there was one interchange over pass
that was redone and one bridge over I-75
that had to be redone.
everything else squeezed in.
So you go back to those numbers and you say,
wow, why can't we do it for that cost?
Well, I look back at that national highway construction
cost index nationally.
And over that time, from 2013 to 2024,
there was 111% increase in construction cost.
Now, if you multiply that out, it's still
south of the total dollar amount.
but these are two very different projects
of what we are trying to eventually accomplish.
Again, where that we've already filled up the median,
the means we're gonna have to go to the outside,
by right away, you know, do more construction,
and then I remind you to, the south end of that project
is only one lane, and it's squeezed in the middle,
and it's only one lane wide, so we're gonna have to do,
be very innovative, which means probably more bridges,
more aerial to limit right away impact
a very constrained corridor. You get into more bridges, high-level kind of things,
bridges that fly over and back into the middle. So our goal is, again, to use the existing
right-away and real estate we have, and there's some wide areas there at Eagle's Landing,
Hudson Bridge, down sort of on the south side. There's some, or excuse me, on the northern
side, there's some wide right-away that we absolutely use, but there's a lot that will just be
You read total interstate reconstruction,
there'll be a very complex.
And if I understand right, the one point,
roughly at 1.8 billion added to the amended budget
is just getting you started.
But there will be more money borrowed
and that debt will be serviced through the fees, correct?
That's correct.
OK.
Cambridge Astros, do you have anything
for the commission?
You know, I know your guys are very available to us.
I know a lot of members have gotten texts to questions.
But one that comes up the most commissioner is on resurfacing.
And you know, it's what we all in here see every day.
We get the complaints about.
And I guess what is the pit up demand?
I know that we check our roads every other year.
We know the grade of them and we've got increased money
from paving.
But I think members want to know what's the demand?
Because I'm always trying to ask for more money.
and sometimes don't have real accurate numbers,
but I'm sure like to know what to mean,
and I don't know if you can answer that right now.
Yeah, I'll let me give you sort of just a ballpark answer there
is I'll go back to that data point
of resurface increased by 51% over the last four years.
So we got, I think you'd agree
that most of our conditions are pretty good.
We sort of, we have key performance indicators
for all our roads.
And we're almost hitting some of the targets,
some of the targets were right on.
So we're sort of close to where we need state of good repair
in a system, but that we got there several years ago.
So if you've got 50, if your money's going half as far,
that's going to tell you that's about what we need.
So on average, we're somewhere around $370 to $400 million
a year to resurface state routes and interstates.
Sort of the other concern though is our interstates.
I like to say all of them have a knee replacement.
the hip replacement and are eligible for Social Security.
A lot of the original interstate pavement has lived
its life and we're having to spend significant amount
of money just as award of warning,
we are rebuilding I-285 from the airport on the west side
up to Cobb County, up through Cobb County this summer.
So don't go over there.
All right.
Stay away.
Yeah.
But the point is that pavement is worn out.
We're having to rebuild it.
But I think the antidotal answer is pretty easy, 51% cost increase.
We were pretty good on our state of good repair sort of where we are, but that means you
about need to double the budget, right?
I mean, so you need that, you know, where we are at 375 or 400, you probably need to be
like, you know, 800 million a year.
Thank you.
Commissioner appreciate you and members, I'm sorry, we're just short on time.
So I'm going to ask Director of Planning Janine Miller to come up and give us her presentation.
and probably just hit the highlights so we can make best use of this last 10 minutes.
Yes, sir.
I've got a lot of data points, but I will go through them quickly.
Good morning. It is great to be with you all here today.
Thank you for your time and your attention to transportation,
which we know is the arteries of our economy, of our communities, and our families.
Quickly, the sort of budget, the 2026 budget included money for the infrastructure bank as
it does every year through the Transportation Trust Fund.
We are excited to have reported that we have awarded all of those dollars to 13 projects
around the state, including the northwest corner, Cherokee and Cumberland CID around Truist
ballpark to support movement there around that economic center all the way down to Seminole
County and the iron city there as well as Twin City in a manual county and up and over
to Athens Clark County. So we have been able to award 13 projects around the state thanks
to your investment there. We also have our current round is open. So there is a card
on your desk with with a QR code there for your local communities to apply for for those
dollars through February 13th. So we'd love to get more applications from around the
state again this year. As the commissioner said, I'm going to talk about the I-75 South
Quarter, but I always have to start with in transportation our logistics enabled businesses.
Since Governor Kemp took office, there have been $113 billion of announcements in private
investment throughout the state, and 88% of those announcements have been in logistics
enabled companies.
In other words, there is a requirement for inbound cargo, for the company to operate
and employ Georgians and outbound goods to market and consumers.
$74 billion or 65% of the total dollar amount.
That is, over the past six, seven years has gone towards logistics enabled businesses
employing over time as these projects roll out 157,000 jobs throughout the state.
So this is a critical, a critical industry for the state of Georgia that relies on our
transportation system all day, every day.
I want to talk about congestion in Metro Atlanta, I think you all have probably felt it, if not on your way to and from the capital here, but throughout the year.
In fact, last year, the most recent publication of a company called Enrex, this is a world-renowned data analytics company for transportation, ranked Georgia as number seventh in the country for worse traffic and delay.
That is 16th in the world, is Atlanta.
That's incredible.
That's a 23% increase in the hours lost to traffic
in the past few years.
The third most increase in the US.
And the other metro areas that had worse traffic growth
than Atlanta were Baltimore and Philadelphia.
And those were for one time events, you may recall,
that the unfortunate bridge collapse in Baltimore
caused a great deal of congestion there,
as well as there were issues with the Philadelphia transit system safety, significant safety issues
that shut that down. We're not for those very unique one-time events. Atlanta would have had the
worst traffic growth in the country since 2023. Last year, people sitting in Atlanta traffic lost
75 hours. That's 50 percent higher than the U.S. average. What does that look like on our
roadways. On the left is red to green. Since 2019, we have had basically the population of the
city of Newark, New Jersey moved to Metro Atlanta and the roads got worse. Some of them got better,
they're in green on the left, but all the rest of them got worse. On the right, you can see the
degree to which they got worse. And this corridor, I-75 in the south metro area, the lifeline to
Northern Georgia through Metro Atlanta had the worst traffic and this is midday. This is middle
of the day. This is not rush hour and these are the times as the commissioner mentioned when we
are reversing the direction of the lane. Express lanes are a choice, great choice for Metro
Atlantis or anyone traveling through Georgia. Since 2011 when we opened the I-85 corridor we have had
significant growth in fact in the last two years since we've gotten those really bad
traffic numbers and data we've had a 12.6% increase in the use of our express lanes that's
system wide. A little zoom in here on the I-75 South corridor, 5 million trips. We've
had an 84% growth in trips since fiscal 18 when it opened. It is currently 12 miles
long, although as the commissioner said, it's only two miles for portions of it and one
lane in each direction for a couple of miles on the cell.
This is what it looks like to the average traveler who's doing a Google Maps search
challenge isn't going to take me to get through the corridor.
In the morning, northbound, the lane is going in the northbound direction.
And using the toll lane, it would take 10 to 16 minutes to get through there.
80% increase, though, if you're trying to get through that corridor in the afternoon.
And you might say, well, 10 minutes is not that big of a deal.
Well, actually, that lane would provide a 21 mile an hour increase in speed through
that corridor if that lane were going in the northbound direction.
And you multiply this, this might just be what you see on your phone for your trip.
But you multiply this by the number of people every day who cannot get into the lane, average
about 100,000 people every day who cannot get in to the express lane.
So we have something in transportation analytics.
This is how it looks to us as transportation professionals, a road report card, levels
of service.
It's an A, B or C, you're doing well if you're an F, you are failing.
And these general purpose lanes are failing Metro Atlanta travelers, and by 2050, this
is all day.
Do you see that red all day long?
This is an all day model.
There is not a way to get through this corridor at any hour of the day in 2050 with any ease
or speed.
That is all we can predict, but of course we cannot predict crashes.
So compound onto those data points, the growth in traffic and the delay.
What is caused by the slowdowns that are caused by unpredictable crashes is quite severe
throughout this court or particularly on the northern side.
So there is no way to get around these crashes when the lane is going in the other direction.
By the numbers, this is the real data.
This is the roll-up of a most recent month of data we were able to gather in December
of 2025, time and money lost by the numbers,
$193,000 average vehicles per day.
That is $334,000 vehicle hours of delay
in just the month of December.
Every person lost 9.3 hours that month
to traffic on that corridor.
And so you have to budget 80% additional more time
to get through that corridor on schedule.
And the cost to the economy is real.
$15.5 million is the cost of that unreliability.
But what's very interesting is where those cars and trucks
are coming from and going to.
The darker the gray, the more trips originate
and depend on that corridor there
in the center of the state to get through.
So it's not just the express lane,
it's all of the general purpose lanes
that are dealing with this traffic.
And once we have a lane going in both directions,
There will be 70% more vehicles that can pass through this corridor.
And I say vehicles, it's not just cars.
18% to 20% of the vehicles getting through this corridor,
attempting to get through this corridor, are trucks.
They carry $620 million a day of freight value.
In a year, that's $226 billion.
That is roughly 25% of the value of freight moving in Georgia
goes through this corridor and sits in that traffic.
This corridor has also been named
by the American Trucking Associations
as the worst freight corridor bottleneck in the country.
It's number 12, one through 11 are all interchanges.
This is the number one worst corridor
in the country for trucks.
Director, we're getting some looks on time at the back door
And rules chairman has come in.
And so we're going to clear this room.
But thank you for that quick presentation.
And we may ask you back to either this committee
or chairman Jasper's to so we can have time
to ask you some questions.
All right, thank you.
Hey, members, if you would take your packets with you
when you go to...
