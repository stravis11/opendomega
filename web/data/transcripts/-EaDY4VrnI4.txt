They are convening having arrived. All members will please report to the floor of the house
and take your seats. All members will report and take your seats. Mr. Clark, you want to ring
the bell.
We're about to have the morning roll call.
All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber and the clerk will unlock the machines.
have all members voted have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the
machines. Well, hello Friday. I almost dispensed with the roll call this morning, but then
I thought, now I'm going to reward those that are here. Let's let y'all vote.
The chair wants to give a reminder before we convene this special session, we sent out
a advisory on the COVID-19 protocols for the special session. Those of you that are reaching
for your mask, that's what I was going to talk about. Mask on the floor in the chamber
are mandated and in committees, not in your office. You don't need one. And if you're out
of microphone in here, you do not need one. So thank you for your cooperation on that.
We will begin this beautiful day with Scripture reading in prayer by the chaplain after which
to we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
Our chaplain this morning will be introduced
by the gentleman from the 68th House District,
the chairman of the Public Safety and Homeland Security
Committee, Chairman Jay Collins.
Chairman Collins.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
It's a joy to be able to present the chaplain
of the day today.
Pastra Eddie Allen comes to us from my hometown,
Villa Ricca, Georgia, where he has been the pastor of the first Pentecostal Church there
in Villa Ricca for the past 30 years.
He has two children, a lovely wife, Miss Penny, and he's been a vital part of our community
for a long time.
His family's been ingrained in our community for decades.
Those of you who know me might have heard me talk about my dad.
He was the youngest of 17 kids, and his dad passed away when he was a young man or actually
just a few years old. Brother Eddie's father had a store there in my town and my
dad went to work there as a as a young teen and his dad really mentored my dad
and showed him a lot of things about life and their family was just very good to
my family early on and Eddie and my dad grew up around and around together and
I called my dad to say that Eddie was going to be the chaplain of the day
day to day and my dad said you know son he said I've got a lot of friends he said but
none that I would trust anymore than my good friend Eddie Allen so today ladies and gentlemen
I welcome pastor of the day pastor Eddie Allen.
Good morning ladies and gentlemen it is an honor and privilege to stand before such a distinguished
audience.
Jay, the representative of Jay Collins, thank you for the invitation.
To begin with this morning, I want to read an excerpt from the Apostle Paul's writings
to the Church at Philippi.
He was encouraging unity, and I think the message still stands clear today in the world that
you and I are living in.
He begins with grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, being confident of this very thing that
he who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ.
Therefore, if there is any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship
of the Spirit. If any affection and mercy fulfill my joy by being like-minded, having the
same love, being of one accord of one mind, let nothing be done through selfish ambition
or conceit, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than themselves. Let
But each of you look not only for his own interests, but also for the interests of others.
And then he says, let this mind be in you, which was in Christ Jesus.
Can we bow our heads in prayer this morning?
Dear Heavenly Father, you are our God and eternal King.
You have created all things, and you are the source of every blessing.
We ask for your guidance and yield to your direction.
We pray that we would humble ourselves before you today, and that you would lead us in
the way that we should go.
Father enlighten us that we may know your will.
We desire your glory and blessing in all that we do.
We thank you for each and every one who is in this room.
We ask that you would work mildly in us today.
Your word says that all things work together for the good of those who love you.
Father, we love you.
We place our hearts and our minds in your hands so that you may direct us.
We ask these blessings in Jesus' name, amen.
Now we will pledge the legions to the flag.
the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one
nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.
Thank you.
Sometimes you can say a lot.
Briefing.
And my man is a preacher of friends.
Quality's better than water.
Can you say anything about that?
I've been told this one.
Yes, sir.
Thank you so very much.

On Tuesday, November 2nd, 2021, 16-year-old Timothy Barnes, Jr.,
A.K.A. Tim Tim was murdered by a classmate
while waiting for his school bus around 6.30 AM.
Timothy was a student at Central Gwyneth High School.
In fact, the high school that my daughter graduated from in 2004.
He loved school and he loved sports.
He worked at the McDonald's in Grayson, Georgia.
Timothy was the youngest of five children
for his mother, Latoya Nicholson,
who was home recovered from a car accident
when she received the news that her son was gunned down.
Timothy will be late to rest on Saturday,
November the 13th, 2021 at 3 p.m.
at the United Methodist Church on Beaver Room.
Our deepest sympathy goes out to his mother,
his siblings, his family and friends.
We ask for a brief moment of silence for Timothy
and the family who are now left behind to mourn his lost.
Thank you very much.
Chair recognizes representative Frazier,
representative Al Williams, Chairman Parrish,
and representative Hugo Lee for a morning order.
Thank you, Mrs. Speaker.
To all my colleagues that are gathered here with us today, we are here to honor a beautiful,
beautiful, remarkable leader that we lost in September, Miss Deborah McGee-McClairey,
the CEO of the Sickle Cell Foundation
for the state of Georgia.
I received a call on September the 12th,
actually from Miss, and we call her Dell, from Dell.
It's a call that I will never, ever forget.
And a call that I hope many of you will never receive.
It was a call to tell me goodbye.
She called to tell me, thank you for your service.
Thank you for all of you all that are gathered here
that have helped our constituents,
over 7,000 that live with this dreadful disease
every day of their lives.
She fought her own battle, but she was always there
for every constituent here in Georgia, Fiscal South.
She was a woman of remarkable poor.
She cared for a cause that her father, physician,
and medical colleague and friends started back in 1971
In 2012, Deborah McGee McClary was named the President
and CEO of the Sickle Cell Foundation of Georgia.
There she led an incredible team.
The Sickle Cell Foundation, Board of Directors,
staff has here her family and her children
that are stretched across in four states
are actually on live watching us now.
For those who knew her, for the many visits
she made here at the Capitol doing Sickle Cell advocacy day,
will forever remember Ms. McGee McCleary
as a woman of incredible focus and resolve.
And she never forgot what her real goal was
and that was helping our constituents
who live with this disease.
I just wanna say to the family,
we sent our sincere condolences to the family
and to our Sickle Cell Foundation.
But just know, over the 30 minutes that I talked to her,
which I did not know would be my last conversation,
I told her that we would continue the fight here at the state capital to make life better
for all that lives with sickle cell disease.
At this time, I would like to have a moment of silence to honor this remarkable Georgia.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
recognize this chairman Cooper for a morning order.
Thank you very much. Colleagues, I know that most of us are looking forward to
Thanksgiving, but I'm asking you to go a little farther out and think about
Christmas. Every day when we come in to the Capitol and we go out, I pass two
boxes down there, and they are very empty. They are the toys for tots, box, for children,
needy children, who may get very little for Christmas. So I'm asking you to stop by
Walgreens or some your way home or another pharmacy or a toy shop and pick up a little
toy and bring it back with you when you come to the capital on Monday and put it in that
that box. Let's fill that both of those boxes to the top. I mean, this was at Walgreens.
It's a cute little tea set complete with food and spoons and cups and saucers. It was
$7 at Walgreens. But that $7 will bring a lot of joy to some child on Christmas morning.
So I hope you'll join with me. Let's fill those boxes up. Thank you very much and thank
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes Chairman Chokus for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good morning, colleagues, and happy Friday.
Rarely, do we get to share things from the well that can actually save a life and
especially with the COVID lockdowns, there's been an increase in domestic violence and
Governor Kemp's initiative to combat sex trafficking has shown that we all need to help these powerless victims.
I thought that I would
Like to share with you the international non-verbal sign for help

down. Use it, recognize it, and act upon it. If you see it, please call 911. Thank
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes Representative Mayna for a morning order.
Chair recognizes Representative Holley for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I just want to say that my heart is going out and sure as many of us are here with those
who are working in the John Deere factories throughout our state.
We realize that for an American company that has provided this state with the wealth
that agriculture has been able to bring in.
Realize, too, that when it comes to the workings
and their families, it's necessary for us to remember them,
especially as we go into this holiday season,
that wages are important.
And as much as we believe that for these factories,
they oftentimes may have robots.
This is, let me tell you, so oftentimes,
we have men and women who are working hard every single day
to make sure that they can not only provide food
for their families, but that they can have a future.
So as we wait in the fourth week,
while these labor negotiations must be had
with the workers, the United Auto Workers,
and these John Deere Facilities,
let us remember that is why we claim to have a full love
for this country and our manufacturing traditions.
We have to make sure that we are taking care
of our American workers.
I'll send what you know, thank you.
All right, that completes morning orders.
Mr. Clark, we don't have a local calendar today.
Okay.
Fork will read the caption to a group of privilege resolutions.
Commending STEM Atlanta women and for other purposes that completes the reading of privilege
resolutions.
Is there any objection to adopting the
privilege resolutions that Chair
here's none and the resolutions are
adopted?
All right, we have, we have some birth
days. Today, today, I'm excited about this one. The birthday of representative Billy Mitchell,
wish you a happy birthday. On Sunday, you've got the birthday of representative Duane
Green Hill, Chairman Butch Parish, and Representative Sandra Scott.
What purpose does Representative L Williams rise?
Parliamentary inquiry.
I like to lodge a formal protest that we showed up today in spite of Billy Mitchell's birthday.
Well had I known, we would take it off.
We could have taken off, we can take off something next week and trade for the week after.
Yes, everybody's thinking about that one.
All right, we have an announcement, Chair recognizes the Chairman of the House Rules Committee,
Chairman Smith for an announcement.
Thank you, Miss Speaker of the House Rules Committee, we'll meet Monday at 9 o'clock
in room 341, Monday at 9 o'clock, thank you.
