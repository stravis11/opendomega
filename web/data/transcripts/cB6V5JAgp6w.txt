TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good afternoon everyone or good morning everyone sorry jump in ahead. My name is
Long Tran State Representative of House District 80 thank you for being here
this morning. We're here to celebrate film in Atlanta it's such an important
industry to us. Last year it provided over 2.6 billion in spending over 60
thousand work in the film industry and provides over $800 million in to Georgia's GDP.
I'm going to give you a little run of show today. I also want to thank Senator Danzala James
for co-hosting today with me as well as state representative Kim Skowfield, Shea Ginedaña,
Kim Alexander, Yasmin Nioh and Angela Moore. But today we are going to this morning be
honoring Steve Mench who we lost last year in both the Senate and House chambers at 10 a.m.
And then at 1 p.m. today, there'll be a meeting greet with the state legislature in room 216 at 1 p.m.
And I'd like to quickly recognize Lee Thomas from our film office. And then tonight at Atlanta
City Hall will have our film day over at City Hall at 5.30 p.m. So Senator James if you'll make some remarks.
Good morning. I greet you all and I'm honored to join today with my colleague in the house
and we are thrilled to celebrate the film industry day.
I'm honored, always, to see the incredible impact
that Georgia Film Industry has had on our state.
Over the years, Georgia has become a top destination
for the film and television industry,
created opportunities for countless
Georgians and boosting our economy
here in the state of Georgia. In ways that you could never imagine
most people think it's just the actors and the
person behind the camera but no. There's so many other jobs that have been created
by one thing that the legislature did and I'm glad I was the second
sign on it and that was when we pass the bill to give tax credits to the film industry
and we wanted to kind of give them an incentive to come to Georgia and it's working because
last year alone the film industry generated and astonished, I can't even pronounce it right
Now, astonishing $4.1 billion in direct spending.
Amen?
Continuous.
And we continue here in the state of Georgia
to ask the top filming locations in the nation.
We're very proud to be in front of Hollywood,
in front of New York, or standing alongside of them.
So thank you very much for joining us
for Film Day at the Capitol.
Georgia is continuing to move forward
and to lift up our film industry.
Thank you.
I need the water.
Thank you.
And now.
Good morning.
I am Georgia State Representative Kim Schofio representing District 63, which includes
Fulton County, City of Atlanta.
Happy film day at the Capitol.
We are so excited today to recognize those in an industry that has made Georgia proud.
Those that are working in the film industry, those that are vendors in the film industry,
those from top down, we're happy today to celebrate you.
As Senator James has said, the film industry has brought in significant dollars here in
the state of Georgia.
We continue to work hard through all of the avenues, whether it's independent films, whether
it's films that are coming through our major studios, our upstart studios, our production
companies.
We've got amazing opportunities here in the state of Georgia that we're taking advantage
of.
field organizations like the Black Entertainment Economic Council is doing
phenomenal work to ensure that minority representative representation is
across the board. We have a lot of people that are in the industry as a whole when
it comes to being trained. We are the best and we have the talent. There's no need
to go further. Georgia is your stop. So today I am excited and proud to
to stand with our colleagues as we embrace
and we grow and we move forward in the film industry.
Let's continue to keep Georgia on our minds
when it comes to filming and making a reputable mark
that can never ever be erased in Georgia.
I support the film industry 150%.
Thank you.

Georgia's thriving film industry, but we also

building Georgia's film community.

which has brought billions in production spending to our state,
to fostering a network of industry professionals,
GPP has worked tirelessly to create opportunities for filmmakers,
crews, and businesses alike.
