Justice moderation purpose
good afternoon
it is a pleasure to be here with you all
today and it's a pledge of certainly to
be here Mr President thank you so much
for the invitation to join you today and
join this uh August body uh it is a
pleasure to be our Lantern it's a
pleasure to be a Georgian it's a
pleasure to be able to stand here in
this season in this time to say just a
few words of encouragement and hopefully
Challenge and inspiration as well
uh in the Book of Joshua
um about the third chapter the people of
Israel are prepared to go over uh the
Jordan River God gave Joshua some
instructions as regards to what was to
be done as they crossed over there was
no Bridge there there was no bridge to
take them over so there was a challenge
because at the season they were going
over there was a great amount of water
flow for the joy and it was a harvest
season as a result it wouldn't be easy
to cross over the Jordan River but God
promised uh Joshua that he would back up
the Jordan River so the people could
walk over into the promised land on dry
land and so even as they crossed the
instruction was given that as the priest
came to the very edge of the Jordan they
didn't have to step in they stepped to
the very edge of the Jordan River that
the river was stopped and the flow
stopped and the flow stops long enough
for the entire nation of Israel to cross
over on dry land well the specific
instruction that God gave Joshua was
that that when the crossing was over
when they crossed successfully over
until the land that God had promised to
give them that they would take one stone
each leader of each tribe would take one
stone each priest would take one stone
and from it they would build a monument
a memorial to what had taken place that
day the memorial was to remind the
future generations of what God had done
for them it was to remind the future
generations of what God had done through
them and to remind future generations of
what God was capable of doing and so
certainly after they had crossed over
success with the Jordan River the 12
Stones were taken and stacked up uh and
as Joshua said they'll be able to be to
be a memorial forever and as I began to
think about this years ago I began to
think that anytime a legislative body
meets there are stones that are being
left as a memorial of what God has done
through that body whether it's the city
council the County Commission School
Board uh the house uh and the Senate
that each vote each thing that's laid
down as a vote each vote that is cast
each piece of legislation is a reminder
of what God has done and what God will
do as his people are operating obedience
to him and so I just want to challenge
you all today to continue uh to see God
in in your in guidance as you do this
great work that you're doing to
transform this state uh to strengthen
the lives of those who live in this
state but do it in remembrance that God
has given us this work to do you know
the future Generations will look back
and see what was done through you all
and so that's my Challenge and my charge
today and I'm grateful for the work
that's been done up to this 38th day of
this session and I pray that God will
continue to do that great work in your
midst let us pray
Most Holy in our wives God our Father we
come this day first of all acknowledging
this is the day that you have made and
we are rejoicing even in this day and we
are glad in it we thank you Lord and I
thank you for those who are here the
56th Senators Lord that you've assigned

you have assigned them to do I pray God
this day you bless this governor of this
body my friend your servant Bert Jones
and I pray God that you would bless him
and bless each person in this chamber
today to be able to live victoriously
Lord as they do successfully the work
you've called them to do I pray that you
wouldn't move in this place or that
there'd be moments of clarity I pray God

of them we thank you Lord for your grace

on what would be his 85th birthday
the late great mayor Maynard Jackson
who was born on this day in
1938 and this year actually marks the
20th year of his passing which is hard
to believe
um he's had deep deep ties to Atlanta he
entered Morehouse College through a
special early entry program and
graduated when he was only 18. he went
on to law school
and of course in 1969 when he was
elected mayor of the city of Atlanta it
marked the beginning of Atlanta's shift
from just a city in the south
to Atlanta and international City
recognized worldwide he was a stalwart
champion of minority supplier and
diversity and making sure that Minority
businesses received more Municipal
contracts
he got into a lot of riffs with people
for this but Atlanta continues to be a
model recognized throughout the country
his political and business prominence
led him on to start many businesses
including the one with my husband
Jackman hospitality
and he served on many many boards
including Morehouse College which he
went to and loved the National
Association for the advancement of
colored people and the Georgia
Department of Industry trade and tourism
which of course we now know as the
Georgia Department of Economic
Development he died of a heart attack
unexpectedly in Washington D.C like I
said 20 years ago in June and he remains

game and then all of a sudden I hear
about the house winning uh the kickball
game so
um
I know y'all say I cheated but it really
truly indicates that when I leave the

members of this body I bring to you uh
the Senate Appropriations substitute to
house bill 19.
first I'd be remiss if I didn't point
out the folks who got us to this point
today as you know our Senate budget
Office Works Non-Stop
they're scattered around the room and I
want to recognize them again Brent
Courtney Austin Martha Grace Lindsay
Mary Sunny Caitlin Carly Noah
and downstairs Angela and Abby and today
Spencer and Chloe who helped put
together some stuff to get ready for
today y'all know we're missing Caitlin
back at home right now of medical
emergency earlier this year if you guys
would give them a round of applause even
in Caitlyn's absence
[Applause]
team you are phenomenal individuals and
you are quite a phenomenal Collective
team and it's a pleasure to work with
you in the past four years that I've had
the opportunity to do so I also want to
thank our friends at OPB the months that
they put into making this bill happen
before we even got here director Farr
and his team of staff I have listened to
our concerns over the past half a decade
and a lot of the changes that you've
seen Incorporated over the past three
years are changes that that he hurt us
on and through time was able to work in
to the governor's budget from the
beginning
also chairman Hatchet his first year has
been phenomenal his compassion his
openness ideas for mothers he listens so
much better than I do y'all know that
y'all probably go to him instead of me
um but he is he is a force in the house
already
and I know that our budget will continue
to improve with him at the guidance from
the helm from the house
and appreciate speaker Jones at the time
and speaker Burns for keeping him there
the FY 24 budget proposal before you now
is a 34 2.4 billion dollar budget
it supports law enforcement as I said in
committee it protects our family
supports our children and quite
literally as many of you wrote and asked
gives them hope
in the big picture that I said already I
know it's fair to say that the Senate's
version more fairly reflects the
governor's budget than than our comrades
cost the hall our Compadres across the
hall
comrades probably not the best word to
use was it there boys
the Senate's budget in Big Picture
replaces funding that the house pulled
from Medicaid it also replaces the
reinsurance program that was reduced by
the house and adds to it
it returns hope funding to 100 percent
for students with a B average that was
the second most requested item by the
members of this body
and it supports the governor's two
thousand dollar raise for all state
employees
moving into tidal areas we'll talk about
health and Medicaid you know we restored
the cuts that were endured across the
hall to ABD
we also were able to True up some costs
due to f-map changes through ABD limb
and impeach care
our budget also allows for the
reimbursement of Oats occupational
therapy assistance and physical therapy
assistance and provides allows them for
Medicaid members receiving children's
Interventional Services which also
provides parity with our neighboring
states
there's a show up in this budget before
you have about
a billion dollars to the state health
benefit plan we talked about that a
whole lot in the amended budget but you
see it reflected here
and in DHS we worked with DCH DHS and
the office of health strategies to begin
a plan to address a structural deficit
in our child caring institutions about
60 million dollars and that allows for
those institutions to transition over to
a new federal model which will allow
them to be eligible for federal 4E funds
in the future
at the Department of Public Health we
match the house and actually doubled the
funding for the babies can't wait
program it's an early intervention
program that supports infants and
toddlers with special needs
and back over at DHS we added five
million dollars to support the ending of
hoteling
go a little off script here for a second
when I spoke the other night I told you
that there were
um at the time I believe 13 or 14
children who were sitting in ERS across
our state waiting for our State
Contractor to move them out to permanent
medical placements where they could get
the care and services they need we know
that ERS is not the place
that serves them best
also doesn't serve our budget best
as of right now or as of last night 68
children
were in hoteling situations across our
state
that is 68 too many and we will continue
to hammer this point until it's 68 less
we also had 17 children as of right now
who are bouncing either between an ER
a crisis stabilization unit
or residential psychiatric treatment
facility
we spend 178 million dollars a year
including federal funds on this contract
and I do not understand
why that 178 million dollar total
contract
cannot end this issue
back on script
the Senate's budget also provides 18
million dollars to provide time to allow
child carrying institutions to
transition over to the qualified
Residential Treatment programs I
mentioned to you before
and it adds over 40 million dollars over
the governor's budget to address mental
health Staffing and facility needs at
the Department of Behavioral Health
we held the line with the increases that
the house proposed for our home and
community-based providers
and the line item
that we were requested to add the most
by the senate members in this budget
was that the Senate's version of House
Bill 19 will fund 500 now comp waivers
and the credit for this again goes to
the senators from the 40th and the
senator from the 56 who championed this
cause in a bipartisan fashion and had
numerous numerous members of this body
sign on in support of their letters and
I appreciate their their approach and
their support
in our budget categories concerning
education I think it's fair to say that
we address three things literacy
dyslexia and QBE
for the second year in a row there's no
austerity reductions of the QBE formula
and we did fund the two thousand dollar
teacher increase
this budget also made significant
progress towards screening all students
from kindergarten through third grade
for dyslexia by including nearly five
million dollars for the cost of
screening in addition to other state
funding for dyslexia coordinators and a
dyslexia endorsement for teachers which
is already in the base budget at 1.63
million dollars
we passed that bill several years ago
Senate Bill 48 it was set to come online
in FY 2025
and this budget actually brings that
dyslexia screening online one year early
funds it one year early and thank you
for the support from the members of the
subcommittee and the other members of
this body on that endeavor
we also were able to take Senate Bill
211 championed by the senator from the
fourth and you've heard his comments on
literacy in this chamber many many times
over the past two years
and we took and made it more than just a
council and a commission we were able to
stand it up by moving roughly one
million dollars behind it to support its
initiatives to help with early reading
to address our third grade reading
levels which you've heard the senator
from the fourth talk about
lie below 50 percent for on grade level
at higher education the Senate's budget
returns to the governor's position by
funding 100 Factor rate for prior
tuition for the Hope grants and the Hope
scholarships at Public Schools
it also adds another nickel to move the
public library materials grants to 70
cents per capita for a total of 7.7
million dollars
and it provides additional funds for
tcsg to recognize the high cost of
delivering CDL and nursing courses which
are also both high in demand last year
we were able to fund the aviation
portion of this this year we were able
to come back on nursing and CDL programs
the Senate's budget also supports
conservative budgeting by requesting
that our Board of Regents utilize carry
forward funds to support the teaching
formula and conserve valuable State
dollars at a time that I've told you
were the clouds on the horizon are begin
to look a little darker
we expect continued discussion with the
governor's office and with the house
consider concerning building funds bond
funds
in a robust discussion I'm sure we'll
include will continue concerning how we
fund planning dollars building dollars
and ffne that follows after the
buildings are built
in the area of Public Safety Arts the
sentence proposal supports technological
and data management upgrades at our
courts it also supports a six thousand
dollar increase for state troopers
Capitol Police DNR Rangers and the gbi
the way we funded this was actually by
reducing funds for the trooper School
Trooper schools are typically funded
each year for about 11 million dollars
we cut that in half use those excess
funds to move to those State Police who
have had
as you know increased duties over the
past two years
our thought was there is a learning
curve as people exit Trooper school and
these other training schools and if we
can if we can hang on and keep our our
already trained
staff that that's actually a cost
savings long term and better Services
provided for our citizens
we funded the Cold Case unit the gbi and
the senator from the 26th would not let
me get out of this Podium without
telling you that we funded bonds to
improve the gbi crime lab in Macon as
well as various scientist positions that
that gbi crime lab to answer the call of
those below I-20 for why they're having
to travel so far for certain services
and wait for death certificates and
other things the center from the 26 has
been a champion on this issue the
department has heard him we have heard
him and we are really really thankful
for our director register and the
answers that he's already bringing to
the table thanks to the senator from the
26th
[Applause]
our state budget funded other things as
well I want to run through them really
quickly the Statewide Independent Living
Council had a wait list of about 700
people by moving funds in other areas of
the budget we were able to wipe out that
wait list we're also able to start a
program that improves natural gas access
in rural communities acknowledging the
success that the governor's office and
the members of this body have had with
Broadband for years we were told
Broadband Broadband Broadband we had to
deliver Broadband everywhere well guys
you've almost done it
but now we see that when one mountain is
crossed
there lies Another Mountain ahead and I
think the next Mountain ahead of us from
a utility standpoint is going to prove
to be natural gas so the Senate's put
down its marker to begin a program to
help it span capacity in rural areas and
we look forward to working with our
partners in the governor's office and
across the hall to see where we can end
on that in conference
the Senate's budget also supports our
growing EV industry by transitioning
certain unfilled positions at certain
Regional projects to other Regional
projects in Southeast Georgia
and it also funds the AG Department's
requests for increased funds to enforce
sole Amendment rules across our states
the Senate budget has already told you
funds the coal increase for game wardens
at six thousand dollars and it funds
support in ag for positions in blueberry
Citrus and the peach industry
the Senate budget also makes a continued
commitment to reduce State liabilities
by committing five million dollars to
reduce the state workers compensation
liabilities we were able to do that a
few years ago at a six-figure number we
were able to drive that number down and
save years in in outstanding liabilities
the five million dollars again is just a
marker to continue that program after
the extreme success of our folks at doas
under director Sullivan and Wade Dameron
the Senate budget also agrees with the
house to provide a one-time benefit
adjustment of 26.75 million in total or
roughly 500 individual for All State
eligible retireees and it also
recognizes that ERS colas are now being
pre-funded through employer
contributions as we move forward
the Senate budget increases funds for
the Georgia Food Bank program and it
recognizes 11 million dollars in transit
projects outside of Atlanta with a novel
idea championed by commissioner McMurray
to basically make sure we're not
doubling back over our own certain rides
and helping citizens get to the services
and appointments that they need to
the Senate also funded various bonds I
see you've already turned there most of
you have in USG projects we're going to
have a longer discussion about planning
dollars I look forward to having that
with you and others and our colleagues
in the house
but it does provide roughly 600 million
dollars in bonding capacity for the
future years
I've already told you that you know we
don't get to create dollars so where do
we get those funds well that that's
part of your budget as well we didn't
agree with some of the house ads there
were fmap changes that I mentioned
earlier that our staff was able to
develop and by the Senate going last we
get the best the last crack at seeing
what the fmap changes are going to be
we were able to True up the dollars a
certain unhired positions and unfilled
positions and then there was as I
mentioned already conservative budgeting
uh aimed and targeted at our largest
agencies with directions to use other
funds whether those be carry forward
funds or agency surpluses
or other retained Revenue
we held the house reduction at airport
Aid and we provided the same percentage
reduction at rail Aid
we pulled funds committed to the
criminal data Exchange program and we're
going to move those to the new program I
think the senator from the 18th has a
bill on that that we expect to see
shortly or we've seen in this chamber
we'll see from the house shortly
we also reduced certain funds at other
program expenditure areas like the
Georgia coordinating Center the Georgia
cyber Center and the Georgia public
television
we reduced our testing budget and some
people have asked why did we do that
well this body for years has maintained
its commitment to reduce the testing
requirement on our students and on our
teachers in the classroom
and if we're going to reduce that
testing requirement we believe the
budget should follow that reduction in
tests and this budget reflects that
I've heard a lot of reports about
headlines lately I actually brought the
paper to read this one doesn't get
delivered to my district so I have to
pick it up when I'm here
and I saw lines that say we're in a
budget fight
that this building's about to burn down
they don't know if we'll make it the
sunny day well guys I want to tell you
for the past 200 years we've made it to
Sani die
and there's been no problem
and the rhetoric in the Halls isn't
always the truth
you see I asked our staff today
with me to count up the lines of this
budget
there are fourteen hundred and twelve
lines
in HB 19.
of those lines
743.
52.6 percent
have already been agreed upon by the
house
the Senate
and the governor
52.6 percent
if you've taken look at just
where two of the bodies agree just the
house and the Senate
1176 lines where we already agree that's
83.29 percent
you see folks in this building will try
to stir you up sometimes and get you
worried
I want to remind you they're getting you
worried about 236 lines
236 lines out of 1412.
members of this body
what you've done over the past 38 days
is incredible
you focused on your districts you
focused on your constituents you focused
on your families and what you want for
your future
and I don't think we're going to have a
problem with the building burning down
or us making it to day 40.
so Mr President
with that thank you again for allowing
me to present this bill on behalf of the
Senate I'll take any questions and if
there are no questions I'll yield the
will
and you and your team have done a great
job Senator you do have a few questions
uh senator from the 14th
thank you Mr President Senator Senator
yield yes sir uh thank you Senator and
uh just to go ahead and begin by echoing
the great respect and appreciation uh
that I know many of my colleagues have
for your role and the role of the staff
and putting together uh such a
comprehensive document working hard on
this
um I want to raise an issue I think it's
been covered a little bit by media
already which is a 25 cut to Georgia
public broadcasting obviously on its
face there are many members of public
who have a concern about something like
that I mean the importance of public
education via TV and radio can't be
understated and so I just want to at
least raise that question for you Mr
chairman today to see if you could
address the record on why the Senate
version of budget includes that cut well
thank you Senator yeah happy to do so
it's actually 26 but that's uh thank you
for that number uh it takes the funding
level from 14 million to roughly 10
million I believe if the reason behind
it if they look if folks have questions
in the media about it they can look back
at the FY 21 budget they'll say this is
not the first time this has been
addressed over the years other stations
who are I guess would be viewed as
competitors in the same space as GPB
have brought a very valid argument to
our body and they've said hey why are
you funding one and not the other let's
be honest what they're really saying is
why are you funding my competition
but I think that's actually a very valid
point well why are we picking winners
and losers I don't think that's what the
space we want to be in
so the dollar value it was reduced I
believe in the FY 21 budget one time
already we were able to come back and
work things out there's not a hatred of
GPB in this building if you look back at
our amended budget there's a six hundred
thousand dollar ad for lighting for
their Studios I think you'll also see in
this budget there's a bond ad for radio
towers and other equipment necessary I
think the GPB education budget if you
look at our audits that were performed I
believe less than FY uh be FY 20 because
it was 2019-2020 chairman Hill argued or
a push for that audit last or the
education program was a hit and it
scored off the charts where the content
that was being able to provide and I
know it was multiplied during the
pandemic so that we would love for the
continued focus on educational
programming I think they have maybe some
of the competitors have struck a chord
with members of this body and others who
brought up the fact that why are we
picking winners and losers and we don't
we don't want to be in that market and
right now that argument is winning
winning the day at least in this body
yeah
thank you Senator I will just correct
record I think I said understatement I
meant to say overstated earlier but
that's the only thing I'll say uh thanks
for your response yes sir
recognize the senator from the first for
a question
thank you Mr President as Senator yield
yes sir well thank you uh Mr chairman
that certainly is a
fabulous budget a lot of work has been
done you know I noticed that uh you know
the Senate fully funded 100 of Hope
Scholarship uh but to me the real
discussion is that the section of the
budget of DCH or Medicaid that the house
had reduced it by about 100 million
and the Senate
reverse that
and asked the Board of Regents to carry
forward the funds uh by a hundred
million isn't that the sort of the real
discussion for that three-legged stool
you sort of like to talk about at times
I think that's a very fair way of
putting it yes sir the house had a hit
to Medicaid of about 110 million roughly
we were able to put that back they uh we
were able we pulled some money out of
Medicaid as well but it was fmap savings
which is a truer cut it's a it's a it's
a real cut and matches with federal
dollars and what federal funding is
going to be set be set at so I do think
it's probably fair to say yes if that
was their 100 million dollar move then
ours was probably on Regents we did put
back the 100 million at Healthcare yes
sir
recognize senator from the 27th
hey Mr President Mr chairman do you
yield yes sir I want to Echo the thanks
that you've heard I want to follow up on
the center from the first question he
was referencing 100 million dollars of
AD back to the health side of the
equation looks like a decent chunk of
that maybe even all of that that was
removed from the University system can
you help us understand that and and
maybe the how and the why
sure I'll walk you through the first the
where it came from uh roughly 18 million
was a health insurance ad at the
University budget
um we were not consulted on that I wish
we would have I'm sure we will be in the
future but when we weren't weren't
consulted on that ad or that move that
really made low-hanging fruit if you
want to be honest if you probably want
to go talk to the people with the money
before you make that change uh but these
the others would have been roughly 88
million out of the teaching formula
the reason being is as you knew we
wanted to add back the funds that were
pulled at Medicaid
and uh to do so you you got to find
those funds well the Board of Regents
has to give because of the former
senator from the 37th chairman tippins a
carry forward report each year it's
actually on the handout that does the
summary on page three of that summary uh
notes that I see the chairman from the
15th holding right now page three is the
summary page of those carry forward
funds
they're broken down in a full report
I'll show you the full report I brought
it up here with me just in case I got
this question it's it's the legislative
carry forward report from October of
2022 breaks down to carry forward funds
for each agency now remember there are
very few agencies that are allowed to
carry forward funds and can't do so
without asking OPB normally the
legislature does not carry forward funds
if we don't spend our six thousand
dollar allowance per member it returns
back to the state treasury if DCH
doesn't they have to ask permission from
opv if uh you know other agencies that
don't have guaranteed funds those are
returned and the university system does
get a a
an ability to hold carry forward funds
those last year totaled on page and
we'll see here I think it's three or
four of the report five of the reports
the third page in your summary
504 million dollars
so we thought if we have to figure out
where those monies should be pulled to
reimburse Medicaid that it made sense to
pull 20 percent only of the carry
forward funds to do so
can I follow up on that just one more
I've heard some comment in the Halls
that the small schools may be
disproportionately impacted I want to
say that that is not necessarily the
facts
if you look at the Georgia Constitution
Article 8 section 4 paragraph 1
subsection C
says directly that the Board of Regents
shall decide how their funds are
allocated
we block grant over three billion
dollars to the Board of Regents
so if you're hearing from a small school
one of your smaller schools that hey
we're going to be disproportionately
impacted those bigger schools like
Georgia Southern and UGA and Georgia
Tech they can handle this carry forward
hit we can't
they don't have to
you see article 8 section 4 paragraph
one subsection C says the ability to
allocate those funds once they are
blocked Grant over to the Board of
Regents well that lies with the Board of
Regents
so if they wish to take these dollars
moves and make them less impactful for
southern for smaller colleges they have
the full Authority not just by law but
by the Georgia Constitution to do so
so I do reject the notion that this
should have a disparate disparate impact
on smaller schools
[Music]
Senator recognizes
uh recognized senator from 53rd
Mr President does the senator yield yes
sir
Mr chairman there's no doubts you've got
a lot of weight on your shoulders and
what you do and I don't envy you one bit
um I think you and I though would both
agree that that Public Safety is one of
the first and foremost proper roles of
government and it's come to my
understanding and I'd just like some
clarification on it that the motor
carrier compliance isn't getting the
same raise that the gbi and the and the
Troopers and everyone else is now that's
very important to the people of the
Northwest because Interstate 75 is the
most truck trafficked Interstate in our
state and Ringold we have a weigh
station there and I think the people of
the Northwest expect that if we give
good pay to officers we can expect good
officers to do the work so could you
clarify why they weren't included in the
race sure I think that you have
Interstate 59 as well am I correct and
Interstate 24 as well
the uh yeah when we were moving the
trooper School Monies to figure out how
we would allocate increased raises we
were not trying to say anyone's better
than others that was not our goal what
we were looking to do is to
um
compensate those who have had increased
duties I think there's a valid argument
that the MCC division has had that what
we focused on mostly were those who were
having to respond to riots and Chaos
during the pandemic and I look forward
to talking with you more offline and in
conference about if there are others we
left out it was not intentional but for
the members of this body and those
listening for where we focused and why
that is why we focused where we did
thank you Mr President members of this
body thank you again for allowing me to
present this budget and uh thank you all
for your Indulgence today I hope you can
vote in favor of the committee

moving on to the rules calendar HB 76
secretary read the caption
26 by representative Powell the 33rd and
others Built Me entitled an act to amend
Article 1 of chapter 10 a of title 43 of
the official code of Georgia antitude
relating to licensing Provisions
regarding professional counselors social
workers and marriage and family
therapists so as to revise Provisions
relating to education experience and
training requirements for licensure and
marriage and family therapy
Committee of the center on children
families recommends that this bill due
pass by substitute respectively
submitted by Senator Kirkpatrick of the
32nd district chairman
76.
Sarah brass of the 28th offers the
following Amendment amend the senate
committee substitute on children
families
to
amend the senate committee on children
and family substitute to house will 76
by adding after a review online for the

Senate children's and families offers

76 a bill between child and active amend
titles 43 and 45 of the official code of
Georgia annotated relating to
professions and businesses and public
officers and employees respectively so
as to change Provisions relating to
certain occupations and appointments
thank you
Senators Tillery of the 19th from brass
of the 28th off of the following
Amendment Amendment two to amend the
senate committee substitute to House
Bill 76 by striking line 129 and
asserting therein and after nothing in
this bill shall add any additional
requirements or restrictions to clinical
pastoral counselors that completely
random as president
recognize senator from the 28th
thank you Mr President I bring to you
all HB 76 and the underlying bills as it
arrived from the house uh it simply just
revises the licensure qualifications for
marriage and family therapists and
brings them into National standards now
once the bill arrived in committee we uh
we offered a couple of of amendments or
I'm sorry we've offered a substitute and
in that substitute I will go over the
the additions very briefly but one thing
we did was if if the governor or someone
is removed from a a board or whatever
that is appointed by the governor there
was no mechanism for the governor to
reappoint that person
um you know so they would have to wait
till that term was up so that vac that
vacancy would remain
vacant until uh till they got until the
term ended and so we added language that
simply allows the governor to do that
and you can see that in uh where is that
anyway it's in the bill and uh lines 120
I'm sorry
um lines 120 through 123.
and also I offered a uh as part of the
substitute we also everyone's familiar
with the Georgia occupational review
Council or whatever you call it
um and we've had issues with gork as we
call it we've had issues with we don't
know if the chicken or the egg comes
first we introduce a bill and then it
goes to gork or
um or does it go to gork and then we
introduce the bill and it's very unclear
and more importantly it really usurps
the legislative process and uh so we've
with with the issues we've had Through
The Years on licensing and I'm returning
uh this power this wisdom back to the
legislature because I think y'all are
the the smartest and the brightest in
this state
and I say that very unbiasedly
and so we are simply going to get rid of
gork
and You Can Kiss It Goodbye so I would
love your support on that
and then we've got a couple of
amendments that I'll speak to
Amendment one which I offered uh along
with the great senator from the 50th uh
this is simply an industry that really
is there's so few people
that partake in bare knuckle boxing
uh and as we all know we're very limited
in our time here as far as the committee
process
and so
um so I thought that I would just bring
this to the committee of the whole and
let us make a decision on this because
this is a standalone bill would never
um probably wouldn't see the light of
day in committee nor make it to rules
and never make it to the floor so this
is really about the only way we can do
it and so simply all we're trying to do
is is is the for the very few people
that have bare knuckle boxing matches is
really just trying to make sure that
it's done in a safe way and then it's
and we're given the authority to the
boxing commission to to regulate this
and make sure it's done safely
um so I know the senator from the 14th
has great passion for this there is a
little irony here that we're having bare
knuckle boxing on with marriage licenses
but
um but it is uh it is in the same code
section and so it is germane and in some
cases it's very germane unfortunately
to on Amendment two offered by the
center from the 19th I'll just speak to
that briefly
um the uh he had concerns with me about
the underlying Bill and and potential
restrictions that may be put on clinical
pastoral counselors so we just wanted to
make sure that was very clear that that
is not the intent of this bill and I am
authorized to say by the house author
chairman Powell
said that he has vast knowledge and
experience with marriage counselors but
he has very little knowledge and
experience with pastoral counselors and
so I didn't want to add that but but
overall I support both amendments and
encourage your favorable consideration
of this fine piece of legislation
that all yield for questions
you do have a couple questions Senator I
figured
senator from the 27th
thank you Mr President chairman yield of
course I wasn't quite able to hear over
here senator from the 31st was was
talking during your presentation but did
you say that you're delivering a
knockout blow to gork
sooner I think that would be accurate
and since the uh
since we're not we haven't regulated it
yet I'm able to do that without any
without it being I know how you love to
regulate things but I appreciate the
effort to uh deliver this bare knuckle
knockout blow to gork well me being a uh
kind of like things equal so I feel like
if we're going to create some government
through licensing and commissioning of
bare knuckle boxing I thought it only
fair to balance it out and get rid of
another government agency
balance is key moderation
senator from the 23rd encourage thank
you Mr President Senator yield I yield
are you I want you to know I fully
support The Knockout blow to court my
question is the point of order is
amendment one germane to the underlying
Bill well if you're asking me my answer
is yes but I think that question should
be directed to the uh I would lieutenant
governor I would ask president of the
Senate to make a decision on the the
germanness of the same code section
Amendment one to the underlying bill
I will take that into consideration
Senator and uh but we're going to let
these other people get finished with
their questions and and uh then I'll
I'll look at the amendments there but
thank you
senator from the 14th are you you want
to speak to it
senator from the 56.
thank you Mr President will the senator
yield I do yield for my good friend from
Roswell
the most powerful rules chairman uh the
home of gork
I understand you have uh an ongoing
battle at gork is that not true
um it was true until today would you say
you're taking the gloves off now
they've been off baby
go get him
but I'll add you know we're not we're
not doing sanctioned brass knuckle
events only bare knuckle events
Senator you got you have a history of
boxing don't you don't I remember you
being a part of a boxing club that is
accurate it was not bare knuckle I had
gloves in both instances and uh I
retired at a career record of oh one and
one
I remember your one and only fight
Senator it was uh it wasn't pretty but
uh well that was my one that was a well
I'm not sure which one you were at
um you have no questions neither one of
them were pretty in my mind
thank y'all yo
I don't believe I don't believe there's
any danger any Golden Gloves being given
out there after that one
so I recognize center from the 14th
thank you Mr President and you know like
the center from the 28th I know what you
all think when you look at me I can see
it in your faces you look at me you
think now that's a guy who can handle
himself in a bare knuckle fist fight uh
in all seriousness since we are
submitting this to the committee of the
whole today I just want to give you a
couple quick facts about the bare
knuckle boxing industry believe it or
not it is actually safer than boxing
with gloves over the last few decades
there have been studies that show that
adding the mass with a glove and the
fact that you feel more unrestrained
quite candidly leads to greater numbers
of concussions and hand injuries than
the bare knuckle version of the sport
and so yeah you title uh you know tape
around your fists and that might cause a
slight increase in Cuts is what studies
show but that's not nearly as bad as the
concussions and the hand injuries that
result from more traditional forms of
boxing so it's a safer version of sport
an important limitation that's in this
amendment is that in lines 32 133 it
says only an individual has qualifying
experience can participate and that's
defined further up as somebody who
essentially is a professional already in
one of the other fighting Sports so this
is a to the the center's point a very
limited amendment that would just allow
a handful people to participate but with
that limited Amendment we would be able
to take advantage of the the fast
growing nature of the sport and be able
to generate revenues uh through you know
pay-per-view and other events so I rise
today in full support of amendment one
you know leave the procedural elements
to the body to the president but this is
good policy and I think it'd be good for
the state of Georgia Thank you Mr
President
does any of the senator wish to speak
for against measure

consideration Senator and I do believe
that this is germane to the bill so

the committee of the Senate on education

by Senator Dixon of the 45th district
chairman
the committee on education and youth
offers the following substitute to House
Bill 87 a bill to be entitled enactum
and chapter 2 of Title 20 of the
official code Georgia annotated relating

Education that completes the order Mr
President
recognize the senator from the 32nd to
speak to the bill
our senator from the 50th to speak to
the bill
thank you Mr President
today I Rise to bring you House Bill 87
also known as the non-traditional
special schools Act
um
the this bill began two two years ago
when this body passed out Senate Bill
153 which in essence
was going to close the doors of three
charter schools in the state of Georgia
Mountain education Foothills and coastal
plains
in response to their pending closure
a study committee was formed hundreds of
hours were put in a lot of work was done
by
our friends across the hall interested
parties across the state and ultimately
we've arrived here with House Bill 87
which will allow these schools to
continue to operate
House Bill 87 establishes completion
schools
these give children
additional options to to get their
degree
children who can't go to school during
the traditional eight to three hours
because of maybe having to help their
family out
um and going to work
this allows them to have an option to
continue to get their High School degree
this will help with Workforce
Development in the state this will help
with families in the state and it also
one of the the good consequences of this
is it will help our military as some of
you may know in order to join the
military you have to have a high school
degree but
these schools are essential they're
essential in our communities and quite
frankly I believe they're they're
essential in making sure Georgia Remains
the number one state in the nation to do
business
some questions that I've received
throughout this process that I think it
would be important to take back to your
district is number one
school or students that are currently
enrolled in these schools will be
grandfathered in nothing will change
moving forward
18 year olds who are considered dropouts
will be allowed to enroll in these in
these schools and we'll have four years
to complete their degrees those who are
not dropouts those who are either at
risk of dropping out behind on credits
or who just need a non-traditional plan
will be allowed to enroll I have you
know two of these schools operate in my
district
I've I've had the honor and privilege to
attend one graduation that actually took
place at Lee Arendelle State Prison and
I got to go inside the prison and watch
the graduation happen and to hear the
testimonies of the students that were
graduating along with alumni that came
back to speak and the success stories
that these schools have had
for these children who otherwise would
not have received their high school
diploma
it is inspiring
um
and I I just I can't ask you enough to
please vote in favor of this piece of
legislation because thousands of
children have benefited from these
schools and what we are doing with this
bill not only will keep the three
schools alive today but moving forward
we are setting a course for more schools
like it to open and so with that Mr
President I ask for favorable
consideration we happy to yield for
questions
yeah you do have one question senator
from the fourth you have a question
sir you you I do yes sir um is it true
that over 6 000 students attend these
three different uh schools in the state
yes sir over 6 000 students and is it
also true that there's six thousand
students were dropouts and we probably
would have ended up in jail probably
ended up on the streets selling drugs
probably ended up teenage pregnancies at
all and that's not happening now that's
correct
is it also true that these students have
the willpower and the want to go to
school from six o'clock at night to ten
o'clock at night because they're working
during daytime
you know Senator I I think the
motivation that I've seen from this this
these schools their students their
alumni the number of handwritten letters
that I received over the past year is
incredible and I would have to say that
the senator knows what he speaks would
you also agree that in this bill
um because of the passion that the
senator from the 12th has about her area
there will also be this same type of
schools that will be created down in
Southwest Georgia to help out the
students in that area
that is correct
thank you Senator thank you
senator from the 32nd
thank you we're at the senator yield yes
I will yes
[Music]
excelsis in my district in Cherokee
County
important
I couldn't agree more
Senator you have no further questions
thank you Mr President I asked for
favorable consideration and we'll yield
the will thank you
we're going to senator from the 45th
thank you Mr President uh I Rise as well
in support of this Bill had passed out
of our committee unanimously uh grateful
to our partners in the house working
with them we did make three changes in
the Senate and just wanted to go over
those with you all real quickly but this
these schools the three schools the
mountain Ed Foothills and coastal plain
they're vitally important for the
students that attend there no matter how
they got their uh you know if they fell
behind in school or whatever it was
where they couldn't complete school
during the regular school hours this
gives them an option to go at night
whether they've got a job or whatever
the circumstance is so it's massively
important that we keep these schools
open and keep these options open for
these children the three changes real
quickly uh we added in working with with
the house we added in grandfathering
current students that were enrolled
which affects my county and some of the
other counties where in Gwinnett we're
in the Metro Atlanta Risa but the
students that are served are served by
Foothills which is in Barrow County
which is only about 2 20 minute 30
minute drive for most clinicians but the
grandfathering lets a 111 students
continue to be able to go to that school
and there's other examples I could give
you throughout the state and also one
other change we made was uh the Youth
Challenge academies there's two of those
currently looks like there may be more
added we want to make sure those schools
stayed open and continue to serve those
students as well and then the
the last one was contiguous counties if
they were in different Reeses and they
were contiguous to each other that those
students could go there and they
wouldn't miss out on those opportunities
with that Mr President I yield well
does any of Senator wish speak for
against the measure
chair here zone is there objection to
the previous question being ordered
chair here is none the previous question
is ordered
questions on the adoption of the
community substitute is their objection

opposed nay secretary with a lot that
on the passage of the bill the A's R53
and the Nays are zero this bill haven't

substitute
good job senator from the 50th I will
tell you there was a lot of work done on
this bill behind the scenes from both
the house and the Senate from the
senator from the 45th as well as senator
from the fourth and the 27th the
majority leader this bill probably got
as much work as any uh any bill down
here trying to help make sure we were
taking care of these charter school
systems that do a lot of good work and I
just want to thank each and every one of
y'all for the hard work that you did
they won't write it in the newspapers
but uh but it was a lot of good work and
a lot of good kids were benefited from
it so thank y'all very much give
yourself a round of applause so
[Applause]
recognizing the
HB 189 secretary will read the caption
House Bill 189 by representative Meeks
of the 178th and others of Philippine
child and act to amend Article 2 of
chapter 6 of title 32 of the official
code Georgia annotated
relating to dimensions and weight of
vehicles and loads so as to provide for
an allowable variance of weight
four weight limitations upon a vehicle
or load
Committee of the Senate on
Transportation recommends that this bill
do pass by substitute respectfully
submitted by senator of the 27th
district chairman
Transportation offers the following
substitute to House Bill 189 a bill to
be entitled an act to amend Article 2 of
chapter six it's title for 32 of the
official code of Georgia annotated
relating to dimensions and weight of
vehicles and loads so as to provide for
an allowable variance for weight
limitations upon a vehicle or load
hauling certain Commodities within a
certain range in areas of the state that
completes the ordinance president
recognize agricultural chairman fine
senator from the 8th District
thank you Mr President three years in
and four sessions in I still get nervous
every time I stand up here but uh
colleagues I Rise uh
to encourage my Senate colleagues from
All Over Georgia not just rural Georgia
to support HB 189 the truck weights bill
in the form of a senate Transportation
committee substitute
I want to thank the chairman of the
committee
and the senator from the 51st for their
work on this bill over the last several
weeks to include several committee
hearings
Georgia's number one industry
agriculture has benefited for the last
three years under our Governor's
executive order by allowing trucks to
haul weights up to 95 000 pounds
with the governor's executive order just
recently expiring this bill would extend
similar policy until July the first 2024
by increasing the allowable weight from
84 000 pounds to 88 000 pounds for
Agricultural and forestry Products
while this bill has a one-year Sunset
and is a seven thousand pound decrease
from the allowable weight and the
governor's previous executive order it
will prevent further disruption in our
supply chain during a time of
compounding inflation specifically the
bill is limited say again it's limited
to Agriculture and Forestry it allows
for a 10 variance it restricts miles
traveler from the point of origin to its
destination to 75 to a 75 mile radius
at Grants local law enforcement the
ability to weigh trucks if they have
reasonable cause and scales
this is important to my Metro friends it
restricts Strokes from entering the
non-attainment area which is the greater
Metro Atlanta area
you all know I have a great passion for
Rural Georgia
I consider this bill to be a Lifeline
for the people that I represent that
supply the food and fiber to all of our
constituents
it's worth remembering that 1.8 percent
of this country farms
but the other 98.2 percent that don't
their life depends on the 1.8 percent
that does
without our number one industry we are
no longer Georgia in closing I would
remind my colleagues that all of our
neighboring states have a variance of
either 88 or 90 000 pounds
vote green just like John Deere let's
keep Georgia growing in the right
direction
for that Mr President I'll be happy to
yield for questions or I'll yield the
well you do have some questions Senator
Senator from the 14th thank you Mr
President senior yield yes sir senators
are not true the beginning of this
session I started out as a no on this
bill and we ran each other into each
other in the hallway over and over again
I was no no and then I put on my great
American collar hat and I thought about
it and I got the yes is that not true
that is true Cinder and you look good in
that hat as well thank you Senator
appreciate it thank you senator
and I recognize the senator from the
47th
oh you want to speak in the front Okay
you have no further questions Senator
okay thank you Mr President I heard your
favorable consideration thank you
colleagues
I recognize a senator from the 47th to
speak to the bill
colleagues this puts me in a really
tough situation
I've got ah actually by birth I have
three brothers but I have two more that
are here in the chamber with me that are
fraternity brothers and I think both of
them want to see this bill pass but you
know I'm going to tell you he said hey
yes I'm a recovering chair
Transportation committee and I I
appreciate the senator from the 27th
he's he's worked hard to try to navigate
where we're at on this piece of
legislation
I sat down with the Georgia Forestry
Association when when our new AG
commissioner introduced a bill to go to
100 000 pound trucks and I said guys I
want to help you get competitive I want
to help you raise the weight on trucks I
want to go to the the 10 variance
but there's a cost of doing that and
there's something that we need to take
into consideration and I want you to
think about what I propose to them and
what it could mean for Georgia
you know a lot of people talk about
Forrest Gump and his sayings about
stupid
well my goal is to stop stupid
down on my desk downstairs in my office
here at the Capitol I've got a citation
for a truck that went across the scales
at a hundred and thirty thousand one
hundred pounds
ladies and gentlemen that truck
was legally able to carry eighty
thousand pounds meaning that that truck
was grotesquely overweight I think y'all
can do the math but more importantly for
me
I think that that's the kind of thing
that that will kill people the truck
becomes top heavy how to load of logs on
it there's no way to say it that's the
truck that will will break down Bridges
and tear apart roads and for me
passing this legislation
it's it's not good for Georgia it's not
good for our citizens
I'm going to vote no on this bill but I
want to try to come back next year
because this is a one-year bill
the if it does pass which I hope it does
not I want to help our forestry friends
and our AG friends to do something
that's more permanent but here's what I
want you to think about and as I look
around at some of our past chairmans of
our transportation committee this is
where it's important that we work
together to improve Georgia
putting grotesquely overweight trucks on
the road is dangerous for all of us not
only does it destroy our road system but
it kills people
when Senator Harper and I can say his
name because he's not in the Senate
anymore introduced a bill to go to a
hundred thousand pound trucks within two
weeks of that
eight miles from my house I had a log
truck coming around the corner on a
state highway
that tipped over into the front end of a
pickup truck
top heavy truck going around a curve and
he killed the pickup truck passenger
Sydney and driver and for me this is
where I look at what we need to do is
we've got to stop stupid now when you
look at these truck weights that are
listed in here my suggestion was okay
our partners and our and the people that
we want to help the most are our friends
in forestry and AG
those crops that they're being grown
whether it be AG or forestry are going
to a location that gets weighed
I've asked our forestry friends and and
AG components I said look guys if it
comes across your scales at 95 000
pounds or above I want to automatically
have access for the state of Georgia to
take those scales and issue a citation
to that trucker right then the uh that
the the people that are going to
relinquish those funds are those buyers
of those products so they know right up
front we're going to stop stupid and we
mean it
for this they uh I I really troubled to
have my brothers that want to pass this
bill the uh that are working hard and to
do the things that we need to do to keep
Georgia competitive with our surrounding
states but what we have to do today is
we've got to stop stupid this bill
passing it is is what I call stupid and
so I'll ask you to vote no I hate it
that it's this way if it does pass I
want to make sure that everybody in here
understands next year when we take this
up the uh we need access to those scales
so that those people that are going in
over 95 000 pounds automatically get a
fine thank you for your attention
recognize senator from the 26th
thank you Mr President
ladies and gentlemen
I'm old vote for this bill
uh
some on my conscience
first of all
like you and a mad class you take
accomplice
and draw a circle
and then you say I can't come in
that means I got to hire somebody
in another truck
come take some weight off because I
might have a delivery at
Family Dollar Dollar General
or any other vendor
the other thing is
is strictly agriculture
well I've got constituents
who drive for a living
and it's about the payload that's how
they make a living that's how they pay
their taxes that's how they pay the
house note the car note
because Insurance send the kids to
school
and I got a lot of friends
that end up drug business
so now you tell them
and AG trucks can't hold no dirt they
can't haul no gravel and they can't haul
no time
so you're gonna tell the folks who can
fix the roads
that they came home
and it's about the payload
and the only reason I'm gonna vote for
it
Mr President
because it's going to get to the house
it's gonna be a conference committed and
I like to be on it
and the only way you can get on it is
you have to vote for it
but
we have a bigger problem than that
roads and bridges
we've got to find a way to put the money
in the transportation to fix the roads
and the bridges
this argument has been going on too long
for the last 20 years I know
and I've heard from cities
and some counties
but let me say to you we don't grow pine
trees in the city
they are grown in rural Georgia
and you don't get any tax money until
those trees are cut
to go in your Digest
and then we got to haul them
out of your garden
they take them to the mill
so it's a two-way street
in this same
government don't operate our water it
operate off money
right now we're going to take money out
the pockets of some folks
for a year
and y'all know that ain't right
we ought to do what we need to do we
ought to fix the problem
that we've had plenty of money
that we've been giving away all year
about all the money we had
we ought to be giving that money to fix
these roads and bridges
we talk about these car plants coming to
Georgia
but when they come
you got to put an interchange there
are we paying for The Interchange that
does the energy
excuse me does The Interchange come out
of Dot's regular budget
we need to think about that
we are growing state
we need to do what we need to do
and stop it making excuses about why
we're not doing it
thank you Mr President
you have no question senator
and I believe I believe we put the house
at a distinct disadvantage if I put you
on that conference committee right there
we wouldn't and we wouldn't want to do
that we wouldn't want to do that
recognize senator from the 27th
thank you Mr President colleagues Mr
President please send that Senator to
conference with me I would love nothing
more than to serve with him and get more
time my good friend I think I'd just
take a few minutes y'all and unpack
kind of a little history where we are
why we're doing what we're doing
um for 2005 to 2020 before the pandemic
we lived under the current law which is
to allow an 80 000 pound truck weight
with a five percent variance so 80 000
pounds in the variance of five percent
brings it to eighty four thousand I
think it's important to note that there
is no variance on the interstates so
we're only talking about state and local
roads so if you have a trucker who wants
to essentially Traverse the state on the
interstate system they're gonna need to
be at 80 000 pounds either way during
the pandemic as the senator mentioned as
he was presenting the bill Governor Kemp
increased that to 95 000 we had lived
under that for approximately three years
and about a week and a half ago that
executive order expired and we are back
to our 84 000 pounds for certain
Commodities only I think that's the
other important thing to mention is that
the current five percent uh exemption
allowance is only for certain industries
among those are Agriculture and Forestry
but also includes solid waste and
concrete and recycling materials and a
number of other things one thing that we
heard a lot of testimony about it is
universally agreed that increasing truck
weights will increase the degradation of
our roads we don't there's a little bit
of disagreement as to how much that
would be we heard everything from a
taking a 20-year Road lifespan down to
12 years or potentially taking a 20-year
Road span down to eight 18 years I'm not
here to litigate who is right because
frankly I don't know but what I do know
is that somebody is right
and regardless of how right they are we
know that we're going to need to see
more funding in the state when it comes
to our critical infrastructure
the commissioner of GDOT gave me a swag
estimate that if we were to change to
what the house had proposed that he
would need 500 million more dollars a
year for the maintenance on the state
roads only that does not include any
maintenance on the local roads which
would also be impacted and I'm sure all
of you have heard from your local County
Commissioners Mayors and city councils
as it relates to this issue
the other states surrounding us have
made significant Investments of both
arpa funds and their surpluses into
infrastructure when I talk about
significant I'm talking about billions
of dollars not tens of millions not
hundreds of millions but billions of
dollars of one-time funding that they
have made with their surpluses we have
we have as a state have not been able to
do that or have chosen not to do that so
our our infrastructure needs need to be
thought about when we talk about these
weight changes something else we heard
about in committee was the safety issue
it was highlighted a federal department
Highway study looked at 80 000 pound
trucks versus 90
000 pound trucks excuse me so different
than what we're talking about here but
they talked about a two foot stopping
distance difference between 80 000 pound
truck and a 90 000 pound truck so I know
for me when I first heard about this
issue I thought that safety would be one
of the primary things that we heard
about but I was surprised frankly in
courage to learn that you do not have a
significant stopping distance between
those two trucks at those two weight
limits
in the bill we contemplated the fact
that right now mccd is the only entity
that can enforce our truck weights the
house sent us a bill that did not expand
that enforcement the Senate allows local
law enforcement to purchase scales and
enforce weights if they want to it also
gives them probable cause to pull trucks
over if they appear to be overweight and
conduct a weight a weighing of that
truck additionally and this gets to um
senator from the 47th point about
stopping stupid we increase fines in
this bill above and beyond what the
house had done and we changed the total
distance traveled from The house's 250
miles to 75 miles
we limited this as the senator from the
who introduced the bill mentioned to
only the non-attainment are we sorry we
precluded the non-attainment zone so
these are areas that will revert back to
the law that was in place from 2025 to
2020 and is back in place today I want
to read those counties to you so you
know what those are and again these
counties will not apply to the
additional variance so they will be back
at the 84 000 pounds for those
Commodities these are the counties of
Cherokee Clayton Coweta Cobb DeKalb
Douglas Fayette Forsyth Fulton Gwinnett
Henry Paulding and Rockdale
and then the last thing that we did and
I think this may be the most significant
piece of the bill is we put a sunset in
this bill for the middle of the year
after session next year why did we do
that
I want to come back to the funding piece
we know that we have a funding problem
and it's been proposed that we just put
a tax on the everyday citizens and
figure out a way to pay for the Freight
Logistics funding and you can imagine
what I think about that
we know that we need to get the freight
and Logistics industry to the table to
participate in the funding and we know
that if we did what the house did which
is essentially give away all the
leverage and not have a Sunset and give
them essentially exactly what they asked
for that there's no way they'll come
back to the table to have the funding
conversation that we need our funding
needs will be in the billions of dollars
and we do not need to put that simply On
The Backs and solely on the backs of
somebody who shops at Amazon like
Colorado did and like had been proposed
in the hallways here we know that we
need the industry at the table to have
that significant conversation so Mr
chairman I lastly want to inform the
members of this body that as the
chairman of Transportation I spent
extensive time
talking to my colleagues about this
build essentially whipping this bill and
this bill as it came out of the house
was Dead on Arrival in the
transportation committee so we have
arrived at a carefully crafted
compromise a compromise that allows the
very important people of middle and
South Georgia to do their work in the
industries of Forestry and agriculture a
compromise that addresses many of the
concerns of the locals who are worried
about funding who are worried about
safety who are worried about things like
the sunset most importantly who want the
ability to enforce these laws with
inside their own jurisdictions
so I would close my comments by saying
I'm supporting the bill
and I'm also saying that I've had
additional conversations with colleagues
in this chamber to let you all know that
we need to encourage our house members
as we talk to them to let them know this
is the best deal they're going to get
they need to agree this to this bill and
to this compromise we need to allow
these industries to move forward with
certainty for the next year and then we
need to come back for a very serious
conversation about how we properly fund
the infrastructure in this state Mr
President I'm happy to answer any
questions or I'm also happy to yield the
will you have one question Senator
Senator from 47th
thank you Mr President would chairman
yield to my predecessor absolutely thank
you and and you know this is a delicate
dance that we do down here every year on
all the pieces of legislation my
question for you is in committee we had
the motor carrier division testified to
if they put every one of their law
enforcements out
trying to do everything they can to
enforce the truck weights you remember
the percentage that he said he could
barely get to but it was a single digit
percentage I forget if it was two or
five but it was less than five percent
and for me what I'm trying to do is is
and I think that you would agree would
it not be better for us to work with our
partners so that we have a hundred
percent in compliance by using the
information that these scale operators
have when those logs and AG products are
delivered we would have a hundred
percent compliance in Georgia is that
not true senator they would have 100
compliance but we certainly would have
100 enforcement so we would have the
ability if when a log truck rolled into
a million was weighed and was overweight
we would have the ability to assess a
fight at that point and I'll tell you
Senator I'm all for all four having that
conversation as we move forward what we
did in this bill I'll remind you those
we do allow locals to have the
enforcement option they currently do not
have today so I think that that's an
important thing that we need to discuss
in the off session with those industry
partners and find the best way to get to
the point of 100 compliance which I
think will be the goal for all of us in
this chamber thank you for your your
work on this thank you Rick and a
senator from the 56. thank you Mr
President is Chairman yield I do
chairman isn't it true that uh the three
years that Governor uh Kim suspended
that that we didn't see any major issues
of Public Safety whatsoever is that not
true I believe that is correct based on
all the testimony we heard so Senator
based on that this just makes good
prudent sense and the great work that
you and the team did so we can continue
this conversation to take care of both
business Public Safety uh and the
overall goal of helping out World
Georgia is that not true I believe
that's 100 correct and I appreciate the
question thank you Mr President I
yielded well you have no further
questions
recognized as a senator from the 51st
majority leader leader
thank you Mr President we're going to
bring some
props up on the podium here to talk a
little bit today but before I start
talking about the details and the bill
I want to um
I want to talk to you about
our Department of Transportation
our Department of Transportation
is uh is led by commissioner Russell
McMurray
many of you know him uh by Russell if
you don't know the commissioner I
encourage you to get to know him there's
also a planning director at GDOT her
name is Janine Miller the planning
director at D.O.T is hired by the
governor
the commissioner of the D.O.T
is hired by the board of the
transportation department of the Georgia
Department of Transportation those board
members are elected by the house and the
Senate
so essentially the commissioner of the
D.O.T works for the board
through us
he does not work for the governor
there's been comments made through this
whole process last year and this year
that I've sat by and watched and I've
heard comments not from this chamber but
I've heard comments from people out in
the hallways and I've heard
comments from house members who have
questioned his authority his ability his
knowledge reputation of his job that
he's done while he's been the
commissioner of the D.O.T and whether or
not he should even be in this building
trying to advocate for or against
legislation let me remind you who the
commissioner is he's been at the D.O.T
since 1990. that's longer than some of
you have been alive I believe
he came into the D.O.T as a trainee
after graduating at Georgia Southern
with the civil engineering degree I
first got to know the commissioner when
I was a Seoul County Commissioner in
Lumpkin County in 2001 and I've known
him ever since so I probably have known
him longer than I've known anybody else
in this building
he quickly moved up the ranks he became
the district engineer in the Gainesville
District
he moved to Atlanta became a
construction project manager he became
the planning director for then Governor
deal
and then he was later promoted to the
job as commissioner of the D.O.T he
serves on the MARTA board the third
aboard the Greta board he chairs the
American Association of State Highway
and transportation officials which is
known as ashto
he chairs their standard their standing
committee on Performance Management he's
also the president of the Southern
Association of State Highway and
transportation officials known as sashto
he was named the Georgia Trend Man of
the Year Georgian of the year in 2018
and let me remind you why that is we
were sitting in this room six years ago
next week when the I-85 bridge fire
caused that bridge to collapse you all
that were here remember the night when
it happened we lost the 92 section
92-foot section of Interstate 85
within 43 days
the commissioner managed to replace
three sections of southbound and three
sections of Northbound Lanes on
Interstate 85. that was a record no one
had ever seen done in the United States
our commissioner is the best in the U.S
he's definitely the best commissioner
that I've seen while I've been involved
in local and state government we need to
listen to our experts he has a chief
engineer by the name of Meg perkel
they're here to help us legislate
they're here to give us advice and I
want to thank he and his staff for the
wonderful job that they have done
guiding us over the years especially
since we passed House Bill 170 in 2015
so if it's not out of order Mr President
I'd like to recognize commissioner
Murray with a round of applause at this
time
if
now he's not here in this room today but
when you see him
I'm sure he is somewhere not far from
here listening to this conversation when
you see him tell him thank you for the
job that he and his 4 000 employees do
for us
there's a letter on your desk
this information is very accurate the
D.O.T the local governments are not
supporting this bill publicly they have
been working with us they have worked to
get to the compromise that we have today
and as it may not sound like I support
the bill as I continue my conversations
I'm asking you to support this bill I
will vote for this bill for many of the
same reasons that the current chairman
of Transportation supports it and of
course our AG chairman he supports it he
is passionate about AG but before you
hear I want to just talk a little bit
about what roads look like in Georgia if
you're a county commissioner in rural
Georgia you don't see roads that have
asphalt as thick as this here or asphalt
as thick as this core sample here
instead what you have are a bunch of
dirt roads with very little base and
County Commissioners have a hard
struggle with this they have limited
funds they come into office and the
first thing they get is a phone call
from their neighbor who said my dirt
road has been muddy and full of potholes
my entire life I want you to pave my
dirt road and so County Commissioners
want to please as many people as they
can so they set out to do so they start
out with three to four inches of
aggregate base which is this gravel with
a little bit of sand mix in it and they
put one to two inches of Chip seal on it
chip seal is nothing but gravel and tar
just a real thin layer and a lot of cars
and trucks will drive on that for years
when you put a hundred thousand pound
truck on that chip seal it will not last
very long at all those roads are built
just basically to get people out of the
mud as you start to get into more of a
state route
specification this is where the D.O.T
has set their specs today or C you'll
see six to nine inches of aggregate base
which is gravel and then they require
three to five inches of asphalt if you
move to the federal highways in Georgia
especially down around the ports where
these two senators are from
15th District in the first district I'm
sorry the second district in the first
district you will see
bigger roads being built with concrete
and asphalt so they'll start out with
eight to ten inches of gravel as a base
and then they'll put eight to ten inches
of asphalt on top of that and then
they'll put 10 inches of concrete on top
of that gravel
and so you can see the thickness of that
roadway now compare that to this three
or four inch piece on a state route or
even compare it to a local County Road
that I described where there's one to
two inches of asphalt what do you think
the best weight should be the heaviest
truck should be right here that's common
sense the federal government only allows
80 000 pounds of weight to be on this
interstate route this is a core that was
taken off of Interstate 75. this is an
actual profile of the asphalt and the
concrete that is on that road today
eighty thousand pounds is a federal law
on this road
we want to put ninety thousand or a
hundred thousand pounds on these State
routes or even worse on a County Road or
a city street that's only two to three
inches thick
my point of saying all this is this
discussion doesn't end today we'll pass
this bill and we'll send it over to the
house and I'm like the senator from the
27th I'm not interested in a bill coming
back that has added more exceptions or
more weights what we want to do is have
a conversation over the next 12 months
with the industry people that are in the
gallery and out in the hallways and our
members over in the house we want to
have a serious conversation about how do
we fund our roads going forward to where
we can get from a two inch County Road
asphalt tomorrow like what we see on a
state route or even closer to this kind
of this this construction specification
that you see on the interstates so I'm
asking you to vote for the bill but I'm
asking you even more so going forward
that we support the freight and
Logistics plan that has just been
published and that's going to require
funding and that's where we come in next
year we're going to have to help find
the Monies to build these roads and
build the infrastructure in our state we
also can't forget how important the
relationship is going to be with our
class one railroads and our Short Line
railroads in this state very important
part of the puzzle is to have our
railroads in place make sure they're
upgrading their Crossings make sure
their safety precautions are in place
and it's going to require funding as
well our ports are one of the fastest
growing in the nation
we want to continue to support our
Economic Development engine that we have
in Georgia but we simply cannot do it if
we do not show the commitment of funding
going forward so ladies and Gentlemen
please support this bill
for a one year's time and we will be
back next year with more information and
more requests for your help Mr President
I'll take any questions you may have you
do have a question couple questions
Senator Senator from the 28th
thank you Mr President Senator do you
yield I will yield for the rules Sherman
uh Senator do you live near Elbert
County by chance I do not would that be
the granite capital of Georgia uh maybe
uh
thank you Mr President Senator did he
further you I do
do you know where you were on July 6
2022
I could look at my calendar if that's
really your if you'll further yield I'm
I've got I'm a little concerned because
on July 6 2022 the Georgia Guidestones
went uh were dismantled in Elbert County
and I'm just making sure you're not the
ah
well I cannot confirm or deny my
whereabouts on July 6 2022. thank you
sir yes sir
you do have another question hopefully
serious serious serious question senator
from the 12th please
thank you Mr President
with the Senate and the will yield for a
series of just a couple of questions is
it not true that deep in Southwest
Georgia I live on a dirt road yes ma'am
I have lived on that dirt road for the
last 20 years
I believe the senator knows of what she
speaks yes sir is it also not true that
most times the Commissioners the County
Commissioners will prioritize rolled
Pavements based on the number of homes
that are on that road
it is is it also not true that the
majority of the paved County roads in my
district all have the Commissioners
names on those paved roads whether they
have one house on there which would
belong to the commissioner or no houses
is that also true that is very true
Senator yes sir that's very very true
thank you very much thank you appreciate
that you have no further questions
Senator thank you very much please
support the bill and uh I'll give the
will
I would remind the majority leader we
usually don't have props but since you
the majority leader we just won't have
to pass on it you know
all right I recognize senators from the
21st please
thank you Mr President I'll be brief I
would say that when this bill first came
over from the house I was a hard no
I am going to support this bill today
I'm going to support the AG chairman I
want to thank the chairman of Senate
Transportation the senator from the 27th
for his hard work I want to thank the
senator from the 51st for his hard work
and and also the AG chairman and our
lieutenant governor
um you know the senator from the 27th
addressed you know the wear and tear on
the roads the safety and the funding
what I want to talk about is Freight and
Logistics funding the long-term plan we
must have we have studied Freight
Logistics for four years and we know
we're going to need to invest in our
infrastructure we had a presentation
from commissioner McMurray who I do
think is one of the best DOT
Commissioners in the country
and I will tell you that there was one
slide that really caught my attention
in the next 10 years the poor the
Savannah area is going to go from 100
million square feet of industrial space
to 200 million square feet double in
size and you're going to have the
Hyundai plant open up in Savannah
now there's already a lot of 18 wheelers
and trucks coming out of the Port of
Savannah it's an economic engine for our
state
but we have got to address the funding
between now and next session because
roads take six to eight years to build
and if Savannah doubles in size in 10
years we're going to be behind the eight
ball if we don't address it so uh I
would just say this that I'm going to
support this bill I'm glad it has a
sunset so the industry will come back to
the table and we can we can work on a
long-term
Freight and Logistics plan as the
senator from the 26 stated we've got to
make sure we invest in infrastructure I
say this a lot and I'll end with this
there's a direct correlation between
infrastructure investment and economic
development and jobs Mr President if I
have no questions I'll yield the well
you have no question Senator does any
other Senator wish to speak for against
this measure chair here is none here's a
rejection to the previous question being
ordered
chair here has known the previous
question is ordered I recognize senator
from the 8th
to close debate
thank you you know there's one thing uh
colleagues
I tell people when I go back home
there's a lot of special interests out
in that hallway there's a lot of special
interests everywhere people big money
folks they can hire their lobbyists but
you know what my job is to be and what
all of our jobs is is to be a lobbyist
for the Common Man
that is our job we had a ag Committee
hearing yesterday where we come in and
had the folks from epd because it's a
very important issue with uh the senator
from the 12th from the senator from the
11th because their Farmers have been
under a moratorium for 12 years they
can't drill a well so if you live in
Quitman County Georgia you can't drill a
well but if you go four four feet across
the line you can put a straw in and
drill a well in Barber County Alabama
well you know what else we're telling
those Farmers you know what else we're
telling those farmers in Quitman County
Georgia we're telling them that
in Alabama you can haul 88 000 pounds
but in Georgia you can only haul 84 000
pounds and so for the people that live
in my district and for the people all
across this this this this state a small
family logging business that's got two
Skidders a cut down machine and a loader
they're going to do about 1.7 million
dollars a year in Revenue
the difference between 84 and 88 000
pounds for that business y'all
on a 50 mile average Hall on 60 loads a
week is 154
000 a year so we as Georgia Farmers we
have the prevailing wage is 14 an hour
but we're buying tractors with tier four
engines instead of tier one engines in
Mexico the people we're competing with
they're still buying tier one engines
every day
we're doing the same thing in our state
to our Farmers when every farmer that
lives in a state that touches us can
haul four to six thousand more pounds on
the road than what our farmers can do
and I will just close with this ladies
and gentlemen I want to thank so much my
colleagues of the lieutenant governor
the members of the transportation
committee especially the chairman for
everything they've done but I will close
with this and it's a pretty profound
statement in my opinion you see it on
bumper stickers all over this state no
Farms no food Mr President I yield the
well

times the families don't find out about

thank you again Mr President and
colleagues I bring you hb80 yes it's
kind of a lawyer bill but it's pretty
simple it's the uniform unsworn
declarations act which removes the need
for a notary to sign documents made by
Foreign declarance that is folks signing
documents under oath in a foreign
country protections for such
declarations are still in place there's
no changes made to the crime of perjury
for making a false statement however the
difficulty of finding a notary in a
foreign country is a barrier to
conducting business and this bill really
improves that the bill does not apply to
notorial acts for depositions the person
signing the document will have to sign a
statement that they understand that
they're making a false statement if
they're making a false statement on the
document that would subject them to
penalty for perjury it's also important
to note that this bill would Elevate

Mr President I moved we take House Bill

Senators moved that house bill once in

others the Philippine title and act to
amend titles 48 and 50 of the official
code of Georgia annotated relating to
revenue and Taxation and state
government respectively so that's to
provide for representation of minority
business enterprises women-owned
businesses and veteran-owned businesses
in the area of procurement of State
contracts for construction service
Services equipment and goods
the committee of the Senate on Economic
Development and Tourism recommends that
this bill do pass respectfully submitted
by Senator Beach of the 21st district
term and that completes the order Mr
President
the senator from third has moved that
hb128 be taken from the table is their
objection that objection recognize
center from the third speak to the
measure
thank you Mr President colleagues I have
House Bill 128 hits Governor's bill on
July in July of 2022
Governor did an executive order to the
Department of administrative services to
address challenges
that small businesses experience in the
state's procurement process the goal was
to cut red tape in that process and to
support small businesses
the doas issued a report
called small business and suppliers
diversity in October
they talked with 28 stakeholder they had
28 stakeholder meetings and they had 600
individual interactions this bill is a
product of the challenges that were
identified in that report built us four
things number one
it decouples the state from Federal
disadvantaged Business enterprise
process previously a dbe would have to
get that certification from the federal
government and then the state and they
did it through the DOT
secondly the second thing it does it
brings the state MBE program and process
under the department of administrative
Services rather than the DOT
the the doas will set policy and
guidelines for the MBE certification the
FED process is still available under dot
but this will help people who are
non-transportation vendors
the third thing it does it adds the
certification process available to
minority business enterprises it adds
also women-owned businesses and
veteran-owned businesses to that process
and I'll tell you that in Georgia
um
we have Georgia ranks number three in
the nation in minority business
enterprises 37 percent of our small
businesses are minority owned about 470
businesses
but uh women
we rank number five in the nation 46
percent of our small businesses are
owned by women about 470
000 businesses
and then veterans we rank number four in
the nation seven percent of our small
businesses are owned by veterans about
76 000 businesses
then the last thing that this bill does
is it incentivizes
what the bill calls Prime contractors
what you and I might might call a
general contractor
with a tax deduction equal to 10 percent
of the payments that they make to an MBE
subcontractor that deduction's been
available since 1991 but this bill will
also add women-owned businesses and
veteran-owned businesses to that so the
sum total of this bill is it will help
uh minority-owned businesses women-owned
businesses and veteran-owned businesses
to better navigate the procurement
process in the state of Georgia and it
will support small businesses Mr
President I yield for any questions you
do have one question senator from the
15th you wish to ask for a question
thank you Mr President Senator yield I
will sir Senator I was looking for you
made a reference to decouple from
Federal Regulations
what is that well previously Senator
what that means is expected in another
area or something now previously to get
certification as a minority-owned
business there was a federal process you
had to go through first you went through
the dot and then you got your state
process now you don't have to go through
the dot say you're a business and you
have you're a vendor and you don't
handle Transportation type issues you do
something else um and this way you don't
have to go to the dot you just go to the
doas okay and get that certification
center for the year for one more
question certainly wants to under
section three it strikes certain terms
specific terms and it yields on the
other page line 47 classified subject
contract of means a small business
certified as a minority business
Enterprise women and Veteran but it no
longer you uh refers to a minority
African-American assembly so does that
put more embracing or I'm just trying to
understand why they strike those
specific references also um
um Senator I would
if you look at uh line
um
10 108
go to 108 108.
yes you see is Houston
this part minority means an individual
who's a member of a race which comprises
less than 50 percent of the total
population of the state and is black
Hispanic Asian Pacific American Native
American or Asian Indian
thanks Senator I guess I appreciate it
as a senator from the 53rd for a
question uh thank you Mr President what
what if somebody identifies as a
minority uh the alternate gender and a
veteran
they hit the jackpot
Senator there's a certification process
that the Dos as will go through
to fully vet
those claims
you have no further questions thank you
uh yield well
does any other Senator wish to speak for
against the measure

the 19th and others that builds me tiled

chapter 11 of title 15 of the official
code of Georgia annotated relating to
permanent guardianship so as to provide
for service by publication
the house offers the following
substitute to Senate Bill 131 a bill to
be entitled and an act to amend part 13
of article 3 of chapter 11 of title 15
of the official code of Georgia
annotated relating to permanent
guardianship so as to provide for
service by publication to update
permanent guardianship proceedings that
completes the order Mr President
recognize the senator from the 19th
speaks to the motion
thank you Mr President Senate Bill 131
was a part of the lieutenant Governor's
child children's and families package
that moved through this body have moved
through the house and are coming back
and I want to say congratulations to
lieutenant governor and also to the
Senate from the 32nd for their work
there Senate Bill 131 specifically was
probably the most lawyer of those law
yearly bills and it dealt with service
who should get service and notice in
dependency actions and in termination
actions so that that part is still there
the house did place an amendment on it
it's an amendment that I want to make
sure we take a second to recognize
it was placed on after a young lady a 15
year old named Diana Romero visited with
speaker burns with our leadership
and with the representative Ballinger
see Diana is a 15 year old I told you
from Gwinnett County who was the only
person in her family to survive a brutal
knife attack by her own mother six years
ago
at the age of nine she lost her father
and four other siblings
and she nearly lost her own life due to
her mom her mother's moment of mental
illness
her mother pleaded guilty to those
crimes and was sentenced to life in
prison with the possibility of parole
Diana's Uncle her father's brother
adopted her last year but he had to go
to court to face the woman who killed
his brother's family in order to do so
Diana's mother wanted her to be sent to
Mexico
somewhere where she had never been to
live with her sister and Diana was
tormented at the very thought of this
you see this bill would automatically
now sever the parental rights of a
parent who's convicted of murder or
manslaughter of the other parent
Diana came to the Capitol as I said two
weeks ago and shared her story for the
first time with members of the House and
Senate and she looked forward to being
here tonight but because of the
transactions of the afternoon she wasn't
able to to do so
and while this bill will not be formally
named for her I hope you'll be able to
vote Yes tonight in her honor and that
it will be unofficially named the Diana
Romero act you see this is a brave young
lady who wants to make sure that no
other kids have to go through the
uncertainty she had to face because of
her mother's conviction due to mental
illness
and she wants to make sure that other
children don't have to endure this and
I'll have a say so and where they go
that's the house Amendment and I think
it's the most pure and honorable and
duly fits on Senate bill 131. Mr
President if there are no questions I'll
yield the well and ask that with your
vote Yes you unofficially endorse that
we name this the Diana Romero act thank

timing goes the good news is

in an act to amend Article 2 of chapter
5 of title 16 of the official code of
Georgia relating to assault and battery
and related offenses against persons so
as to provide for enhanced penalties for
aggravated assault and aggravated
battery committed upon emergency health
workers and health care workers located
on a Hospital campus that completes the
order Mr President
we're going to have senator from the 46
speak to the measure
thank you Mr President ladies and
gentlemen of the Senate this is the safe
hospitals Act
our hospital and health care workers
deserve our utmost respect and
protection we have had some incidents
here where they are under attack
sometimes even physically this bill does
a couple of things one it increases the
penalties for aggravated assault on
health care workers whether they're on
the hospital campus as defined in here
or performing their duties or not
current law is one to 20 years penalty
this increases it to three to twenty
years confinement for such an aggravated
assault it also allows hospitals to
utilize sworn police officers in their
patrolling of their own premises or
their campuses we Define it in this bill
and if they're a sworn officer
post-certified officer they're allowed
to carry firearms at the option of the
hospital and are given the same law
enforcement Powers as local law
enforcement while they are on the
hospital campus and that would be the
the hospital building itself and 100
yard circumference around that they do
not have to use sworn officers they may
also use security Personnel that are not
sworn officers don't carry weapons and
would not have these law enforcement
Powers
