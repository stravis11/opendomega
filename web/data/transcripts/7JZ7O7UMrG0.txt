Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good morning.
It is a honor to introduce my pastor today.
Pastor Stephen Mark Bird.
He is a pastor at Central Baptist Church
in Warner Robbins, Georgia.
He's originally from Southern Louisiana
and we were able to lure him away.
and a tremendous blessing to our family, to our church,
and to our whole community.
So without further ado, I'm excited to present to you
today Pastor Steven Bird.
Well, good morning.
It is an honor and a privilege to be here with you today.
And I'm just so thankful for the opportunity.
First of all, I am thankful to the speaker
for his gracious invitation to be a part of today.
I'm also thankful for Saul Blackman
and for your words, your remarks here,
for all your help in navigating today,
but even more than that,
simply for who he is and what he means to my family.
I don't know of a more good and godly man.
He's a faithful servant, does a great job,
taking care of the people of our district,
and brother, I'm just proud to call you my friend
my brother appreciate you very much. And to all of you, I do want to extend a very warm greeting
from the people of Central Baptist Church in Warner Robbins, Georgia. Some of them knew that I
would be coming here today to speak to you and they asked that I would express to you their deepest
appreciation for who you are and for all that you do for our great state. And I say it that way
intentionally. As you heard, Shawl just shared just a moment ago, I'm originally from Louisiana,
about 14 and a half years ago I got a phone call from first Baptist Church of
Mabelton, Georgia in Cobb County and I came to be their pastor for six and a
half years. They are wonderful people and then I got the call to go back to
Louisiana but I want you to know as soon as I got back I realized the error of my
ways. I needed a very quickly repent and ask the Lord to return us back to the
Promised Land here at Georgia and he was gracious to do that and I have been
the pastor at Central Baptist Church for the past five years and I mean that this is our adopted
home. We love this state, the people of this state and my children are bulldog fans now here in
this state and we just asked the Lord to leave us here that this would be our forever home. But
having said all that, I still do have a little Louisiana in me and it actually gets worse than that.
I was actually born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana.
I was born a mile from the Superdome, and that all is still in me.
I love the people there, love the culture, love the food, the music, and you could probably
see where this is going.
I also love the New Orleans Saints.
I know.
I know.
There's one.
There's one.
I knew that was a dangerous statement to make here in these distinguished chambers in
downtown Atlanta.
But I figured after yesterday that it would be safe to do so.
But I think we would all agree that it is a fun rivalry.
Every time I get to be a part of that to go see it, I don't get to do that too often
on Sunday mornings, because while I'm preaching, but when they have that on a special night,
we always go, I wanted to tell you a quick story about that.
A couple of years ago, they played on a Thursday, and I think it was Thanksgiving night, actually.
And I went, I was invited from a dear friend from the church in Mabelton.
When the stadium was built, he purchased seats, got the season tickets, all that, that
affords him and he invited myself and my wife to come and to be a part of that.
And it was, it was wonderful.
If you've ever done that, whereas seats are, there's actually a very nice restaurant behind
where his season seats are.
So we got to get our seats, go eat.
And it was just wonderful food, wonderful time of fellowship.
And I didn't know what he had in store for me, he didn't tell me everything, but some
of you might know what I'm talking about.
You sit in this restaurant and the back wall of it is actually plexiglass and it extends
down this long hallway there and I'm eating this wonderful meal and I almost choke on my
meal because all of a sudden I see my New Orleans Saints come walk down this hallway.
And I had watched every game, you know, since I was a child.
This was a big deal.
I didn't even speak to the folks at my table.
I just got up and like just navigated to the Plexiglas.
And I just stood there.
It was like a kid in a candy store.
And I just watching these monstrous men come walking by.
And I mean, it was just incredible.
It was almost too good to be true.
It was a great thrill to say the least.
But the best was still yet to come.
Because as I watched all of these Saints players walk by, they all process by.
And then at the end of that, and this is absolutely amazing.
The best football player that has ever graced the grid iron, you know, I'm supposed to laugh
at that, but I appreciate it.
The best football player ever drew breeze comes walking by, right?
And so this is my moment.
This is my moment.
And so I'm so excited.
I can hear like a soundtrack playing behind, you know, I just, this is, it's amazing.
So he's walking up.
I'm trying to get his attention.
And then what I didn't realize in all this
was that my wife was actually videotaping me.
So it's a little embarrassing now,
but this actually is the record.
So right as he got to me, I just not even realizing
it subconsciously put my hand up to the window like this.
And I tried to get his attention.
Everything I could do, I knocked right there on that glass,
trying to get his attention.
And do you know what happened in that moment?
absolutely nothing. He did not flinch. He did not turn. He did not give me any time of
day. He did not look at me at all. So obviously my heart was a little broken about that.
But after reflection, I think we all realize why. I mean, that's just the way it works.
I mean, he's a celebrity, great athlete, all that stuff. We have this neutral relationship.
He doesn't know me. He doesn't owe me anything. Not a look, not a listen, not anything,
we get that. That's not surprising. But I share all of that to say this now to you.
Here is the most surprising truth in the history of the world. That the greatest
being, the greatest person to ever exist, our great God, He actually does the
exact opposite for you and for me. That when we come to Him, He always stops. He
always pauses. He always inclines to us and he always meets us there. And that's
amazing in and of itself. What is even more amazing is that this is not a
neutral relationship. I think we all understand that all of us have fallen
short of his glory. We've all rebelled. We've all sent against him. But in his
goodness, he doesn't give us what we deserve. What does he do? He gives us grace
and mercy. He actually gives us himself through his son. And so it's absolutely
amazing to think about that and then it just continues because what we know is
when we seek him he promises that as his children he continues to meet us
there whenever we're in need whatever that issue is whatever the situation he
continues to come to us he continues to meet to us when we seek his face there's
a great passage that I want to share with you most of you will be familiar with
this is a very well-known couple of verses here in scripture it comes from the
Gospel of Matthew, Matthew chapter 7, verses 7 and 8, it says this, ask and it will be given
to you seek and you will find knock and it will be open to you. For everyone who asks receives
and the one who seeks finds and to the one who knocks, it will be opened. And then here is the rest
of that paragraph there in scripture, it says this, or which one of you, if his son asks him for
bread, will give him a stone, or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent. If you then
who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your father
who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him, amen?
So I know you might be asking, why are you sharing that with me?
Here's why.
This is my thoughts towards you here this morning.
I cannot imagine the burden that you carry, the decisions that you have to make, all that
takes place in these chambers day in and day out.
I can't imagine what you carry as our leaders.
But I do know this.
I know our God and I know His promises.
And I know He tells us that if we will see Him
that we'll find Him and that He will provide everything
that we need as we make those decisions,
as you make those decisions, as you help to lead this state.
And so I just wanted to share all that with you
as an encouraging word.
I want you to know God is with you.
And the number two, I want you to know
that the people of this state we appreciate you
and we are praying for you.
and we are praying that as you seek him,
he will give you everything that you need
and we can trust in that.
As a matter of fact, that's what I wanna pray over you now.
Let me invite us all to stand, please,
and let me just pray over us.
Father, I thank you this morning that you are a good
and gracious God that you love us and know us
and that you have made away through your Son
so that we can know and love you.
And Lord, I am also thankful for the men and women
in this room.
I am thankful for their heart to serve
and for their tireless efforts on our behalf,
strengthen them with wisdom and grace
for the burdens they carry.
May they manage their teams and projects
with diligence and care.
Keep their hearts pure and their eyes
turn toward your face as they work
in the best interest of the people of this great state.
And we ask all of this for our good,
and as always for your glory,
and all of it in the precious name of Jesus.
Amen.
Amen.
You know, join me in the pledge.
of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, on Eurasian
media visible with liberty and justice for all.
Thank you so much.
Good job, Trill.

Thank you.
Thank you very much, thank you very much, thank you very much, I'm good, I'm good, I got you behind me, hold it and get with my back.

I'd like for us to stand and honor a good friend of mine
and a friend of many in this chamber,
former State Senator Ross Towson from Perry,
who passed away this weekend.
He served in the Senate from 2002 to 2015,
as chairman of the Senate Natural Resources Committee.
He resigned from the Senate prioring
a diagnosis of Alzheimer's.
He was born in Perry in 1956,
the youngest of four children.
His grandfather, JD Chanin, served in this body
in the early part of last century.
Ross graduated from Westfield Schools in Perry
with a quite an athlete in many sports
and went on to Athens to the University of Georgia
where I first got to know Ross,
very closely as the fraternity brother.
He returned to Perry to the family business
and then owned as a financial advisor.
He served many, many positions locally
in civic and business,
and a member of the Perry Methodist Church.
But most importantly, he survived by his wife, Sally,
who has been so devoted, looking after him
these last five years in his three children,
son, trip, and twin daughters,
Ashley and Kelly.
So if you would pause and thank you for all the stalls
in his family.
What a great, great public service for all the stalls.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Those of you that are listening arise today along with my two
colleagues who are Vietnam veterans.
And this morning, the Asident General made mention
the great sacrifice from that era.
It was not a great time for those of us that came home.
As the General said this morning, there were no parades.
And while coming through a Harriet and National Airport
in Chicago in my uniform, that was
before security, I was accosted by a guy who had some real vulgar things to say to me.
Well, I wasn't the age I am now, I only have two minutes of fighting me now, but I had
quite a few then, and he got all of them.
Just want to let you know that three of us are honored to absurd our country in that era.
We appreciate it.
We just wanted to share with you because it took us a while to get some honor, but as an
an old Army man, and Representative Loach is an old Army man.
