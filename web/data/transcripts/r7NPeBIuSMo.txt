I saw something I had seen in a long time this weekend. The sunshine. Beautiful day out there today. We will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this afternoon will be introduced by the gentleman from the 16th House District. The majority caucus whip representative Trey Kelly, representative Kelly. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, it is by distinct honor and privilege to have Pastor Barry Snap of Victory Baptist Church in Rotmart, Georgia, here with us today. Pastor Snap is served as a senior pastor of Victory Baptist since 2006, and he is married to his wife Stephanie, and they reside in Silver Creek, Georgia. Pastor Snap is an educated man. He graduated from University of West Georgia, Jacksonville State University, and for some reason decided to attend the University of Alabama as well. Pastor Barry has also attended the New Orleans Baptist Theological Cemetery, outside of being... ...Simonair. He is preaching on Lazarus today. He is chairman of the administration committee for the Georgia Baptist Mission Board, and also serves on the Georgia Baptist Executive Committee. That is his resume, but I want to tell you about the person. I've seen Pastor Barry grow a church in our community to new heights. He has certainly set our community on fire for the Lord. When you are around him, you can't help but see God's work being manifested through him. Today it's my honor to present to you Pastor Barry Snap. Good afternoon. It's a joy to stand before you. Thank you, Speaker Austin. Thank you, Representative Kelly. And thank you all for your representation and your service. And it is an honor to stand before you today. God bless you. It's good to be here. In scripture, the Apostle Paul is the great letter, writer. Paul writes an epistle to the Thessalonians. In Paul's day, there was a city in Asia called Thessalonica. There was also a church there called the church at Thessalonica. So Paul addresses the Thessalonian believers. And he gives them short, succinct, pithy statements. He gives them practical, hands-on, life application. And I'm so glad that Paul recorded these words. I'm so glad that this passage is included in the Bible because I need daily instruction to follow and serve God. I need assistance. I need help. I need a word from the Word. Today, I'm in 1 Thessalonians chapter 5. And just a moment we'll begin reading at verse number 16. I want to speak for just a while if God would help me on this subject. The full believer. A full believer. I am unashamedly without hesitation or reservation a believer in Christ. I'm sure that there are many other believers in Christ before me today. The Bible asks the question, what must I do to be saved as a Bible word? What must I do to be rescued? What must I do to be delivered? And the answer resumes. Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved. So I am a believer. And I want to talk to you today about being a full believer. Not an empty believer, not half empty, half full, but a full believer. We're not supposed to run on empty. We're not supposed to run on fumes, but we are to run on full. Not an empty tank, but a full tank. There is fullness in Christ. The Bible teaches that He is the fullness of God. John 114 says that He is full of grace and truth. Today I don't want to speak grace without truth. Neither do I want to speak truth without grace. The Bible says in verse 16, verse Thessalonians 5, rejoice always. Rejoice evermore. Pray without ceasing. In everything in all circumstances give thanks. For this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. Verse 21, test all things. Hold fast that which is good. Abstain from all appearance of evil. Not only are we to abstain from evil, but to abstain from the very presence and appearance of evil. Verse 24, faithful is God, faithful is He that calls you who also will do it. I want to present to you now four very briefly four principles from our passage. Let's just unpack it. I want to say first of all, be joyful. Be joyful. Joyful means to be full of joy. I'm not always happy. You're not always happy. It's Monday. We're not always happy. Because life happens to us. We've all got stuff. It's this that and the other. But the Bible says in verse 16, rejoice always. Rejoice evermore. Think about the etymology of that word rejoice. Re-joy. Re-joy. To have joy over and over and over again. To have joy and then repeat the process. Can I distinguish happiness from joy? Happiness is dependent on circumstances. Joy is in spite of circumstances. Happiness happens to you. Joy happens in you. Happiness is like a thermometer registering what's on the outside. But joy is like a thermostat regulating what's on the inside. Most of us are familiar with the Acrostic for joy. J-O-Y. J. Jesus first. O others. And then why you. Jesus others you. Nehemiah said the joy of the Lord is your strength. But sometimes we lose our joy. Where we were impotent. We lack strength. But David the Psalmist says, restore unto me the joy of your salvation. So I would encourage you today be joyful, be full of joy. But then secondly, be prayerful. Be prayerful. Prayerful means to be full of prayer in verse 17. The Bible says, pray without ceasing. Pray at all times. That is you have a constant continual prayer in your heart and on your lips. I'm a former educator. I was a middle school teacher in Floyd County for many years. And someone may say, oh, you can't pray at school. It never stopped me. There was always a prayer in my heart. And everywhere I go, even now today, there is a prayer in my heart. There's a lot of things you can do after you pray. There's nothing you can do until you pray. The Bible says, pray without ceasing. And prayer is not our last resort. Prayer is our first resort. Sometimes we say things like this. I've done everything else. I guess now all that's left to do is just pray. But may I say that prayer is our first line of defense. And when we pray, not only are we talking to God, but we are talking with God. When we pray, we hear the voice of the Almighty, but you are looking at a pastor. That sometimes struggles in my prayer life. I don't always know what to say. I don't know how to articulate or communicate or verbalize what's in my heart. Many of you sometimes struggle in the area of prayer. I heard about a little boy and each and every night before he went to bed, he would always say his prayers. He and his mother had a nightly ritual. And every night she would tuck her little son into bed, fluff up his pillow, kiss him on the forehead, and then she would say, it's time to say your bedtime prayers, and then she would turn out the light, and then she would walk outside. And he would begin to pray. But what that little boy didn't realize was his mother would always stand on the other side of the door, just to listen to her little son pray. It was so precious and so sweet, childlike faith. But on this particular night, the little boy was saying his ABCs. He just kept reciting the alphabet, ABCDEFGHIJKElementOP, QRSTUVWXYZ. And it went on like that for five or ten minutes. The mother barged back into the room and she said, son, you're supposed to be saying your prayers. And he said, mama, I am praying. She said, no, you're not. You're saying your ABCs. To which the little boy said, mama, at school, there's two boys that are picking on me. They're bullying me. I don't know how to feel about it. I don't know what to say about it. I don't even know how to pray about it. So I thought I would just give God the letters and let him make the words. There's times in your life, representatives. There's times in my life when we don't even know how to pray. We don't have adequate vocabulary. We don't have the words to express but the Holy Spirit comes. He translates what's in our heart, our emotions, our feelings, our tears, and takes it all the way to the throne of God. I would say this afternoon, be joyful, be full of joy, be prayerful, be full of prayer. Number three, be thankful, be thankful verse 18 in all circumstances. In everything, give thanks. Not in a few things, not in some things, not in most things or many things, but in everything, give thanks. When it's good, give thanks, when it's bad, give thanks. When there's money in the bank, give thanks, when you're in the red, give thanks. When your football team wins, give thanks. When your football team loses, give thanks. Thanksgiving is the opposite of complaining. Do you know anything about complaining? Don't look at your neighbor. Of course you know about complaining. People whine and whimper and bellyache and groan and mumble and grumble and they murmur. But Thanksgiving is the expression of a grateful heart. It is the attitude of gratitude. It is thanks giving and someone said thanks giving is thanks living and everything, give thanks. So I would say be joyful. I would say be prayerful. I would say be thankful, lastly. Everyone perks up when the preacher says, lastly. Number four, all because he is faithful. He is faithful. It's right here in the passage, verse 24. Faithful is God. Faithful is he. You know what faithful means to be full of faith. Great is thy faithfulness. Morning by morning, new mercies I see. As a pastor of a church, I am asked all the time. Would you rather have talented church members with gifts and skills and ability or would you rather have faithful church members? Every time without exception I say give me faithful. Georgia House of Representatives continue to be faithful. Be joyful. Be prayerful. Be thankful because he is faithful. Would you stand with me now as we pray together? Holy Heavenly God who inhabits the throne above. Thank you that you are the provident sovereign God overall. Thank you for your presence. Thank you for your protection. Thank you for your provision. Thank you Lord for the opportunities before us today. Thank you for open doors and God we even want to thank you for closed doors. We want to echo what we have already said today. May we be joyful. May we always be thankful. May we always be thankful. May we be faithful. Lord I pray for these servants before me. I pray for these representatives. I pray for the speaker. I pray for the representative beside me. Lord I pray that you bless their homes. I pray that you bless their husbands and their wives and their children. God we thank you today for this wonderful time together in Christ's name we pray. Amen. We welcome you to the flag and we will pledge allegiance. Attention salute pledge. I'll not at states of America and to the republic for which it stands one nation under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Thank you God bless. Doorkeepers will unlock the doors.

No one member can speak more than five minutes. So having said that, I'm going to let you all engage in a little self-governance here today. Let's see what happens. No strong armed tactics. Chair recognizes for a morning order Chairman Corbett. Gentlemen, before you get in the well, with the gentleman step out of the well. So here's what we're up against. We have a rules calendar. The rules chairman has added a supplemental rules calendar. And we have a bunch of committees that are going to be today. So whatever you have, if you think it's more important than those matters, then have added. Chairman Corbett. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, I asked that you write with me today to honor the life and memory of Alabama Forstery Commission Ranger James Hall. He lost his life in automobile accident last Tuesday. On behalf of the Georgia Forstery Commission and this House, we extend our deepest condolences to the Hall family during this time of tragedy, our thoughts and prayers are with them and his fellow employees. I ask that we take him on the side of his memory. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes representative Al Williams for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And I'm certainly keeping in mind the importance. I don't usually do this, but I think it's important that we do it. Because we all get along fairly well, and we all gentlemen and ladies, we tend to shake hands and hug. Folks, Corona is no joke. I just want to let you know I ain't shaking your hand no more, so don't get upset with me and I'm suspended all hugs until further notice. And Mr. Speaker, I'm doing this because I don't want to see us quarantined in here for 14 days. I like these folks, but I'm not spending 14 days with you. But you're on your exception. But with that, Mr. Speaker, I will be bumping. I will not be shaking your hand anymore. I will yield the well. Chair recognizes representative Howard for a morning order. He waves.

And I know you're wondering why is it placed on my desk this week? Because last week, there was an error. And we have corrected the error. So today, it's official. It's on my let-ahead. And there is my signature. Thank you very much. Chair recognizes representative Gertler for a morning order. Thank you. Thank you. First I'd like to read Rule 1.1 in regards to the dignity and the decorum of the people's house. Quote all members of the house and staff of the house that I can duck themselves at all times with dignity and respect for others in a manner to ensure appropriate decorum and the deliberations of the house and to reflect the responsibilities and come it upon a member or staff of the house. Indeed, the golden rule is paramount. The voters who elected us expect us all to meet those high standards. Thank you. Chair recognizes representative Jasmine Clark for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I want to talk about natural hair. Today I want to talk about the choice to allow my hair to grow from its roots without chemical alteration. Today I want to talk about how to date no law in Georgia affords protections for redress. Today I want to talk about how to date no law in Georgia affords protections for race-based hair discrimination. The Crown acts seeks to change this in order to protect individuals like myself from being discriminated against for wearing their hair as God gave it to them. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes one we didn't get to on Thursday. He representatives stole all for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I stand before you members to talk about women's health with fibroids. The fibroids are non-cancers grown in the uterus which often develop during childbearing years. The pain can be excruciating in the abdominum, the lower back or the pelvis. The menstrual complications can be very heavy and irregular. We both have had partial hysterectomies because of the discomfort that became so bad that we couldn't bear it anymore. Can you imagine as a woman on your menstrual cycle that you are fearful on rising out of your chair because you may have soared your clothes? The fibroids is an issue that we definitely need to focus on in the state of Georgia for better women's health. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes representative Marin for a wave. Chair recognizes representative Hutchinson for a morning order. Good afternoon colleagues. Today I'd like to introduce you to nine-year-old Cameron, eight-year-old Christian and six-year-old Brody.

House resolution 967, my reps on a BOTY the 67, Friday the 118th Gains of the 117th, Weed Hour the 119th, better than 94 than others. A resolution congratulating and commending Mary Francis Early and for other purposes. Chair recognizes representative BOTY for an invite resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am here today to talk about a trailblazer. Miss Mary Francis is a trailblazer. She is the first African American to graduate from University of Georgia, earned a master's in music education in 1962. Miss Early is a product of the Atlanta Public Schools graduating with a valedictorian from Turner High School in 1953. Following her graduation, she continued to teach in the Atlanta Public Schools system and eventually becoming the music director of the system. Miss Early returned to UGA to earn her specialist in education degree in 1967. In 1981, Miss Early became the first African American elected president of the Georgia Music Educators Association. Upon her retirement in 1994, she taught at Morehouse College, Sparrow McCollege, and served at the chair of the Muse Department at Clark-Alione University. For all her accomplishments on February 25, 2020, UGA named the College of Education in her honor. Miss Early is also a proud and active member of Alpha-Capa Alpha-Saroid Incorporate. I give you Miss Early. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Bode, and all representatives of the Georgia House of Representatives. I am so honored to be here first of all because the last time I was in the state capital, I was in high school. And I visited a museum of sorts showing Georgia's resources. But as you have just been told, I, somebody has described me as an unlikely candidate for civil rights activist, but seen a television version of Charlene Hunter and Hamilton Holmes being ousted from the University of Georgia campus on January 11, 1961. I made a decision. I said, I'm going to leave the University of Michigan where I was studying and transfer to the University of Georgia. And my mom said, you must be crazy. They just had a riot. Why would you want to go? And I said, some of us have to do something. We have to actively participate in trying to make our world a better place, and that's what I want to do. And so I did. And I won't go into all of the details, but the journey was tough because neither Charlene Hamilton or me, they had integrated the undergraduate school. I was integrating the graduate school. And nobody wanted us there, it seemed. And so I went back the spring of 1962 and the summer of 1962, and I actually ruined Charlene. And I finished first because, that was not my intent, but I finished first because I had transferred credits from the University of Michigan. And then, after graduation, I was the only black person in line, of course. No one spoke to me, and I thought, you know, not much has changed. So I went back in 1964 and studied through 1967 and got a specialist degree. After that, I was forgotten in UGA's history. It was as though I had never been there. I was completely erased. But I went on with my career because I believe that truth crushed earth will rise again. And so it did. In 1997, Dr. Maurice Daniels, who was then a professor in the School of Social Work, he discovered me by accident, really. And every since that time, I have been wonderfully blessed by the University of Georgia. They have begun to recognize me. Now people know my name. And I wasn't so upset about not getting accolades. I simply wanted history to be true. And so now it has happened. I could never have imagined that the College of Education would be named after me. But last. Last Tuesday, there was an unveiling our naming event. And there were over a thousand people there. I could not believe it. Our governor was there. Many of the Board of Regents, members were there. Anyway, it was wonderful. Friends, family, I only have cousins now. And some are here with me today. But I want you to know that I'm very grateful to this chamber for recognizing me because there are other untold soldiers who worked for all of us. Because now the University of Georgia is changed. When you walk on, when I walk on campus and see the diversity among faculty, students, staff, and so on, it brings a big smile to my face because that's why I went. And I hope that you will encourage your young people to take advantage of the University of Georgia and all of the resources that it has to offer. But I also want to say to you, thank you, House of Representatives, for the wonderful work that you do for all of Georgia citizens, including me. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

You can't just withdraw it. Really? Clerk will read the caption to House Resolution 958. House Resolution 958, I'm resident Bernal, the 77th St. Louis 74th, Scofield of the 60th Scott of the 76th, Douglas of 78th and others, a resolution recognizing commanding the Clayton County Senior Services Department and for other purposes. Chair recognizes representative Bernal for an invite resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It's my pleasure to welcome the 75th seniors from Clayton County. We know that our seniors are a viable part of our community. The Clayton County Senior Services are the only senior centers in the state of Georgia to become accredited under the National Institute of Senior Centers. We have the Director Tory tanks and Ms. Inslee, one of our seniors will bring remarks. Thank you so very, very much. But I would like to thank the Clayton County delegation for this resolution and for our beautiful seniors that decided to come in and make this a great day. Look, the reason this center and the centers of Clayton County are so great, it has to do with staff. Staff goes over and beyond for all of us to make our programs, our events, anything that they put on is absolutely incredible. And we have some really well-fitted young women here. I don't know why we call seniors, but the next time we are performing for you because we are such a good shape. Thank you so very much. We are about to go on to the rules calendar. Before we do, I've been advised that Fulton County Schools will be closed tomorrow. A faculty member there apparently has been, has tested positive for the coronavirus today. And I understand that they're going to take tomorrow off to sort of assess where they are, but I did want to make the members of the House aware of that development. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 984. House Bill 984. On the representative of 176 to be entitled an act to amend Article 1 of Chapter 10 and that title 17, the fiscal to Georgia and Teta relating the procedure for sentencing an imposition of punishment so as to change provisions relating to sentencing. This bill then referred to the committee on judiciary that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative, this is nothing to do with palmetto barriers. Not disguised and hidden in the bill somewhere. Chair recognizes representative, Burchette, to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon, colleagues. I do want to reiterate what Representative Williams said. I'm going to go around and give you the pound, too, because this coronavirus is getting out of hand. So don't think ill of me if I do that. Mitch for allow me to bring to you House Bill 984. This is a criminal procedures bill. And what this does is it clears up some ambiguity within the code. It sets the timelines for sentencing modification to be heard. Currently, the code is ambiguous as to whether or not both the motion for modification and the hearing have to be within the 120 days. This clarifies that just the motion has to be presented by the defendant within 120 days. It also defines when post appeal sentences begin and awards credit for time served in custody. That's all of time served, no matter what type of facility you're in. That's the essence of the bill. And I will yield for questions if there are any, Mr. Speaker. You don't appear to have any. Thank you. Are you able to? Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here's none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill. The chair here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Now this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of House Bill 984 will vote aye those opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? So the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 984. The eyes are 164. The nays are zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 911. The bill 911 by Representative Sussler, 35th and others to be titled an act to amend chapter 16, Article 2, Chapter 3, and Title 35, Article 3, Chapter 5, and Title 42, and Article 1 of Chapter 2, and Title 49 of the official bill to Georgia and it stated relating the sexual offenses. This bill had referred to the committee on judiciary non-civil. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. They are recognized as Chairman Sussler to present the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, the House, I bring before you today House Bill 911. I'd like to thank all the contributors of this effort, not the least of which is First Lady Marty Kemp, who with a statewide coalition of people seeking to move Georgia forward to make it the best state in the nation and provide the best care for foster kids in children and adoption system. House Bill 911 is a fairly straightforward measure that closes a loophole in law that protects foster kids from inappropriate sexual contact. Over the last number of years, we've passed bills to prohibit teachers, counselors, probation officers, medical personnel from having sexual contact with people under their care. This bill simply closes the loophole in prohibiting foster parents from having inappropriate sexual contact with their foster kids. Be straight forward bill at mirrors other parts of code that deal with people under protective oversight. And Mr. Speaker, that I'd be glad to yield some questions. You did not have any questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, again, I'd like to thank First Lady Marty Kemp and the broad statewide effort to improve and really make his positive impacts possibly can't allow as a foster kids. And with that, I'd urge your support of House Bill 911. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass. All those in favor of the passage of House Bill 911 will vote aye. Those opposed to vote no in the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 911. The eyes are 165. The nays are zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 983. House Bill 983. By representing Williams, the 145th and others to be entitled to amend Article 2 of Chapter 1 and Title 42, the fiscal of Georgia annotated relating the sexual offender registration review board. So as to revise the information required to be provided by sexual offenders when they register, this bill ever referred to the committee on judiciary non-civil. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes representative Rick Williams to present the bill. Thank you, Ms. Spaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I bring to you today a very simple bill. We have a nursing facility, hospice facility, domicile and we have about 96 offenders in this facility. Which would mean that our sheriff would have to visit this facility about 80 to 90 times a year as is currently required on these offenders birthdays to refotograph them, rethink them and make sure that they are present and living in that facility. This bill changes that law so that they share if only has to visit that facility during the month of their birthday. So rather than 80 times a year of the sheriff having to go to this facility, he would only have to go 12 times a year. Now it's not my birthday like representative Andy Welch and I can't ask you to give me a vote because it's my birthday. But this is just a good common sense bill and I ask for your support. I'll be glad to take any questions, Ms. Spaker. You have no questions? Thank you. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair hears none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair hears none. The report of the committee has agreed to shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. The members voted. Have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 983. The eyes are 164. The nasors zero this bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 378. House Bill 378 by Representative Williamson in the 115th and others. The Natal Natal Natal 48th is going to Georgia and it is related to revenue and taxation. So it's required the collection of remittance of excise taxes on rental motor vehicles by marketplace facilitators. This bill haven't been referred to the committee on ways and means. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. House Bill 378 was previously owned a rules calendar and was postponed to a date certain that day being today. The chair recognizes Representative Williamson to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, rise today to present House Bill 378 by committee substitute. LC4 3154S. This bill brings commonsense tax paraded rental car customers. As we've seen with our forward thinking economic nexus bill that we passed back in 2018 and are recently signed by the governor for the facilitated bill this year. Our Georgia tax policy is really just catching up with the new gig economy. This bill is when we're stepping a process in that process and sort of similar to the argument of the bricks and mortar book seller versus the book purchased through the internet. Its legislation brings parity to the way the rental car taxes are charged where they are a deal and payable and collected as new ways to rent cars emerge. This bill revises the definition of a real motor vehicle concerned to include facilitated rentals. And by men in this definition it requires that all rental car companies including the new facilitator platforms collect and remit the necessary local excise taxes where they are being charged. The Georgia legislature authorized this type of tax in 1998. It's a flat tax, it's 3% and it's collected in addition to the sales tax. It is imposed only at the time and place where customer pays sales tax on a rental charge. And for those of you who might ask what are rental car excise taxes, when it's locally enacted and only six counties in the state have done that, these taxes are limited to the purpose of promoting industry trade, commerce and tourism for the provision of convention trade, sports, recreational facilities and for public safety purposes. So in essence it gives parity for excise taxes on all car rentals regardless of where customer chooses to rent a vehicle. And as we all continue, this disruptive technology continues to move forward. This is one more ability for a tax policy to keep up with a change in economy. So I'm happy to speak. I'm happy to answer any questions. You have a couple of questions or more. Do you yield? Yes, I'll be happy to take a couple. Let's see. Chair recognizes the chair of the Ways and Means Committee. Chairman Harrell, do you're left for a question? It's gentleman yield. Yes, I do. Let me just clarify, six counties out of 159 currently levy this tax and ACCG and GMA are supportive and this is entirely local revenues for these local projects. That's correct. It's not a new tax. Thank you for bringing the bill. Do you further yield? Yes, sir. I will. Chairman Harrell, do you recognize this representative Ridley to your right for a question? Mr. gentleman yield, I'll be happy to. Most of this appear to appear. Is it companies or is it individuals that are putting their cards on these facilitators? It's both. It's both of them. So the individuals are putting on their pay and full ad ballorm tax. Is that correct? You talk about the title ad ballorm tax. Yes, sir. This card does not have to have a Georgia title to be covered under the rental car tax. Okay, thank you. There are any more questions, Mr. Speaker? I'll reveal the way. You do have further questions if you care to you. This bill, Mr. Speaker has been dead. It came out unanimously out of the income tax subcommittee after one hearing came out unanimously out of the income tax subcommittee. It came out unanimously out of the ways and means committee and further came out unanimously out of the rules committee. And I do want to point out that not one person testified against this bill in any of those committees, not one person business organization or any of our friends in the hall. So I'll yield the well and ask for your favorable consideration on this measure. The one as yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of House Bill 378 will vote I? Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 378. The eyes are 123. The knees are 34. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 877. House Bill 877 by Ruppsen. I've hoganed the 179th and others to be titled back to amend. Title 40, the fiscal to Georgia and it had a relating to motor vehicles and traffic. So it's to provide for standards for issuance of a Georgia certificate of title. This bill ever referred to the committee on motor vehicles that committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chairman Hogan, does this have anything to do with oyster farming? Well, you're moving Glen County forward in many ways. Chair recognizes Chairman Hogan to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the House House Bill 877 allows people who have taken a golf cart and converted it to a slow-moving vehicle which could go up to 25 miles an hour. It allows for the inspection for them to get a title and a tag. If it's an electric vehicle that goes up to 25 miles an hour classified as a slow-moving vehicle, they'll have to pay $200. So on that, thanks to House Bill 178. It was passed before I got here. And I'll be glad to answer any questions, Mr. Speaker. You have a couple of questions if you care to yield. I will yield. Chair recognizes representative Sains to your right for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? I yield. Is it true that this, that the gentleman represents an area of the state that self entitles themselves a golf cart community? The County Commission is trying to pass a golf cart ordinance and run into a problem with slow-moving vehicles or golf carts that had been converted to slow-moving vehicles. And I understand that the city of, does the gentleman further yield? I yield. I understand that the city of St. Mary's, just like the city of St. Simon's, also appreciates golf carts. And this would help them and allow the citizens there to utilize their vehicles as they see fit. Is that correct? That is correct, but I'm not sure everybody on St. Simon's loves golf carts. I appreciate your help for that great city. Thank you. Do you further yield? I yield for one more. Mary recognizes represented to, I'm sorry, Chairman Dollar, to your left for a question. Is the gentleman yield? I yield. Did I just hear you correctly to refer to the city of St. Simon's as in support of this? Mr. Speaker, I yield away. Everybody better get that bill and read it. See what's in there? Gentlemen, is yielded the well? Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is done. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is done. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of House Bill, 877 will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 877. The eyes are 161. The nays are one. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 894. House Bill 894 of our residents have meeks 178th and others to be entitled to act to amend Code Section 243. The official go to Georgia and Tadda relating the C Development Commission composition.

Chair recognizes representative meeks to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I bring to you House Bill 894 related to the C Development Commission. The Commission oversees the intellectual property rights for a C that are developed by researchers at University of Georgia. It's a name of few of the commodities. Peanut, soybean, small grains, blueberries, turf grass, and others. What this bill does extends the terms for which the appointees serve to a four-year term and then staggers those terms so that the institutional knowledge may continue on the commission for a period of time for the members that are appointed. With that, Mr. Speaker, are you up for any questions? You have no questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ask for your favourable consideration. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute?

You go make him one. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? So the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 894. The eyes are 161. The nays are one. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. We'll take a read the caption to House Bill 108. House Bill 108 by Representative Meeks 178. The title of an act to men code section 8-2. One 111, the official to Georgia, and it's headed relating the definitions relative to factory-built buildings in dwelling units. This bill I've referred to the committee on agriculture and consumer affairs. The committee recommends that this bill do pass. Mr. Clerk, do we have a House member named Campbell? How long has he been here? Twenty-five days and he's passing a bill or going to try to? I need to turn my mic off, don't I? Chair recognizes Representative Campbell to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the House. House Bill 1-008 simply changes the definition of residential industrialized buildings in Georgia. These buildings are also what we commonly refer to as modular homes. Currently under Georgia law, a modular home must be lifted off his frame with a crane and placed on a permanent load-bearing foundation. This bill will allow the consumer an option to leave the home on his frame, thus eliminating the need for a crane rental. Even if the home is left on frame, it will still have to be permanently affixed to a load-bearing foundation. This also allows a national industry trend in leaving modular homes on their frames just as is allowed in all of our bordering states for our south Carolina and North Carolina all allow this. In short, this bill will allow for an additional affordable housing option for Georgia consumers. If there are no questions, Mr. Speaker. You've got a couple of questions. Do you yield? I yield. Representative Wolinski wants to know what this modular home bill is going to mean to Dunwoody. Chair recognizes Representative Wolinski to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the representative yield? I yield. My first question, you mentioned cost saving. What is the cost savings when you change a permanent mental chest to a permanent load-bearing foundation? Well, you save approximately $5,000 right off the bat because you don't have to have a crane. Thank you, Representative. Do you yield one more time? Yes. And if it's not a permanent mental chassis, is the other structure also made of metal or what is that other structure made out of? Well, the outside skirt could be bricks, could be wood to cover the entire. You will not see the frame. It will not be seeable. And you will have to be with the local ordinances will all have to be in place. No change there. Thank you. Do you yield for another question? Yes, sir. Chair recognizes the majority caucus whip. Representative Kelly, do you write for a question? Thank you, Mr. Speaker, with the gentleman yield. I yield. Representative, I want to tell you, I appreciate you bringing such an important bill, certainly as your first one. This is your first bill, is that correct? That's correct. Now, just a couple days ago, another representative who has been here a little bit longer than you represent a birchette had his first bill in the well. Do you remember that? I remember it clearly. And it dealt with an important agricultural issue that's taken place in our state. Isn't that correct? That's correct. Will you yield for just a couple more questions? Yes. If I remember correct, you heard me and the floor leader, Mr. Rogers, talk about voting no to represent a birchette's bill, is that correct? Absolutely. And we ended up after thoughtful deliberation, changing our vote back to green. You recall that? I remember well. Can you remind us what you did? Well, I didn't, but I wouldn't have to change later. Well, congratulations on your first bill, and I hope no one else forgets the change there. I think there's a little bit of concern in the well. Thank you. Representative Campbell, that was a great say. You have other questions. You can yield or not. Not, not. Gentlemen, as yielded the well. Thank you. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of House Bill 1-008? Will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does representative Bentley rise? Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. State your inquiry. Is it not true, Mr. Speaker, that I was going to ask the gentleman in the well how his legislation will impact the funeral industry, but he sat down before I got a chance to ask the question? I am sure that that question was you were dying to ask that question. Something like death, is there? Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 1-008. The eyes are 166. The days are one. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 903. House Bill 903 by Representative Dollar of the 45th and others to be entitled to amend Saddle 40 for the fiscal to George Anterty relating to motor vehicles and traffic socialist to provide for the issuance of a traffic citation to a vehicle owner in lieu of the individual operating the motor vehicle in certain instances. This bill then referred to the Committee on Public Safety and Homeland Security that committee recommends a dis bill due pass. Chair recognizes Chairman Dollar to present the bill. Thank you, Speaker. House Bill 903 is some identical language that we saw in this house passed overwhelmingly last year in HB 342. And what it does says is if a vehicle is pulled over for a vehicle infraction, we're talking about an expired tag, tail light out. Last week we talked about window tinting, something like that. It will give law enforcement the ability to ticket the owner of the vehicle if they are in the car, but if they are not the ones driving the car. Currently the ticket must be written to the driver of the car, and there are a number of safe driving services out there where they will come and pick you up and carry you home in your car. And this is just, I see it as some clean up or language. Again, it does not mandate that law enforcement has to do this. It just merely gives them the ability to. But that speaker, that's the bill. I'm happy to stand for questions. Do you yield for questions? I do. Representative Henson, do you have a question? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I do have a question to the gentleman in the well. I yield. I yield. Yes. Thank you. My question pertains to the issue of a stolen vehicle. After five years, if you've had a vehicle stolen and hasn't been reported back, it's taken off the records. So it's not even showing up as a stolen vehicle. Apparently the counties have two May stolen vehicles to keep up with something five years old. Therefore, if the vehicle was stolen, it's going to show back to the original owner how is the original owner supposed to prove that this was stolen when there are no records existing anymore? Well, unless they're in the car that has been stolen, this bill won't affect them. This only pertains to cases where the vehicle is pulled over, the owner of the vehicle, and they can prove they're the owner of the vehicle's driving the car, sorry, it's in the car, but they're not driving it. I'm not sure that this bill addresses the concern that you're asking about. Thank you because it didn't state anything on the notes I had here that the owner was also in the vehicle. I thought the citation could be issued to the owner. Thank you for the question. Okay, thank you. No further questions. Thank you. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none the report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye? Those opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines. On the passage of House Bill 903, the eyes are 161, the nays are three. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. The clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1071. House Bill 1071, my represent of the gull of the 19th and others to be entitled to an act to amend Code Section 46527 relating the telephone solicitations to residential, mobile or wireless subscribers. This bill haven't referred to the committee on energy utilities and telecommunications. That committee recommends a dis bill do pass. Chair recognizes representative Gullet to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This bill is related to text messaging and spam. It aligns the state law with the federal law by adding text messages to the spam statute today. It also adds text messages to the color ID service systems. It includes text messages and telephone solicitation definition. It adds text messages to the same meeting as the federal code section. Again, it aligns state law with federal law related to text messages and spam. Happy to answer any questions, Mr. Speaker. You have a couple of questions if you care to yield. Sure. Chair recognizes representative McLauren to your right for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Sure. I'm a little concerned that this bill might make it harder for young millennials running for office to contact other millennials via their cell phones to talk about the issues. Do you have any reassurance for those millennials? Well, so there's already a federal statute related to how you can text message. In the federal statute, it actually addresses election and get out the vote. So today, you can text as long as it's a single person. You can't, this is basically for robot texting. You can't do that today. This doesn't change that. This actually just brings the state into compliance with that. Also related to fundraising, you can still text for that and for surveys, political surveys. As long as you're not doing it in mass by a machine, you're good to go. I'm going to sleep a lot better tonight, representative. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you for the question. I'll answer one more if there's one, Mr. Speaker. We have no further questions. I ask for your favourable consideration. I yield the well. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favourable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Now this bill now pass all those in favour of the passage of the bill. The vote aye. Those opposed the vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 1071. The eyes are 162. The nays are one this bill having received. The requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Okay, it's that time of session again. Let me have your attention. After Thursday, those of you who have successfully passed a bill out of the House will be working with the other chamber. We are honored to have with us the distinguished illustrious, great, awesome chairman of the City Rules Committee. Chairman Mollis is with us today. What purpose does our chairman Tarvan rise? Parliamentary inquiry. I don't know if my senator had my granddaughter over for invite resolution and forgot to tell me she was there. He needs to come by here and shake my hand and tell me how sorry he is. I also didn't even recognise that she was my granddaughter. I just thought I'd point that out. And you live in his district, don't you? I'm the same street in fact. I believe he'll be right there. Clerk will read the caption to House Resolution 1240. House Resolution 1240 by representative Cantrell over 22nd, urging the federal government to allow states to switch to permanent daylight savings time, this bill ever in fruit of committee on intergovernmental coordination, interstate compact. That committee recommends a disbilled do pass. Chair recognizes chairman Cantrell to present the resolution. I can say this is about time. This resolution is about time and today is a fabulous time for you to hear about this resolution. Now I could spend several minutes talking about the silliness of springing forward and falling back. But I won't do that. I could also spend a lot of time talking today about the benefits of daylight saving time having it permanent year round. But I'm not going to do that because this resolution is not really about those things. All this resolution does is it urges the U.S. Congress to give the states the right to go to permanent daylight saving time if the state so chooses. That's all this resolution does. It's an urging resolution asking the U.S. Congress to give states the right because we do not currently have the authority as a state to go to daylight saving time permanently if we so choose. That's all it does, Mr. Speaker, and I'll yield for questions. Chair recognizes representative Bruce, do you write for a question? Well, the gentleman you. Yes, sir. Just a quick question. Have you looked at the impact this will have on these schools and these kids standing out in the dark? Yes, sir. We've talked about that a lot. It seems to be a common concern. When I left my neighborhood this morning, the kids were standing out in the dark still. They sit out in the dark last week as well. I think what will happen, Representative Bruce, if we go to permanent daylight saving time, you'll see if this is truly a safety concern for our schools, you'll see the bell schedules adjusted accordingly to make sure that's not a concern. I know in my neighborhood the kids standing in the dark pretty much year round already. Because the school starts so early. Do you further yield? Yes, sir. Chair recognizes representative Clark to your left for a question. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. Does this resolution try to seek to switch to permanent daylight savings time through an Article 5 convention? No, ma'am. Thank you. How yield for one more, Mr. Speaker? There you have no more. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I think it's time to vote. I yield the will. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this resolution now be adopted? All those in favor of the adoption of the resolution will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machines. Thank you. All members voted. Have all members voted. Have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machines. On the adoption of House Resolution 1240, the eyes are 145. The nays are 20. This resolution having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore adopted. Okay, listen up. Listen up. We still got a little business to do. Bill 641 will be postponed to the next legislative day. What purpose does Representative Jasmine Clark rise to make a motion? State your motion. I move that the rules on the House be temporarily suspended so that Bill may be read for the first time in a signed to committee.
