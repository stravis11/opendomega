----------
Good afternoon everyone.
>> If I had my gavvel I could get it come
to order. Buzz.
>> Good afternoon everyone.
>> Afternoon.
>> Good afternoon.
>> You all
know what I know.
>> A great day to
>> It's a great day to be a Georgian.
>> No doubt.
And it is certainly a great day for
Georgia's students,
teachers, and parents in our communities
all over this state
because Georgia House Republicans are
delivering on our commitment to give
every student the opportunity to
succeed.
Literacy, as we all know, is one of the
keys to life. The ability to read and
receive a quality education opens
doorways to opportunities and lifelong
success. And right now,
only one in three Georgia students can
read at grade level by the end of the
third grade.
Let me repeat that.
Only one in three Georgia students can
read at grade level by the end of the
third grade.
That's well over 60%
of our children who are missing out on
one of the most important skills to help
them build a brighter future.
Now, these are the questions I wake up
at night and ask myself.
How many Georgians in our prison system
would be leading productive lives if
they had learned to read?
>> Amen.
How many Georgians are struggling with
mental health issues
if they had learned to read?
How many Georgians would be leading
happy, healthy, fulfilling lives if they
had only
been able to read?
Here's what I know, too.
Georgia. Our Georgia should not be
trailing Alabama or Mississippi in any
category.
But they're far outpacing us when it
comes to literacy. And I congratulate
them on their success.
But that also means we have a lot of
work to do. We must do better.
And I commit to you, we will do better
because the future of our state depends
on it.
The time for defi decisive
bold action is now, not later, when it's
too late for countless students.
That's why today,
right now, the Georgia House is putting
forward historic education legislation
that will facilitate generational change
for our children, families, families,
and our businesses across our state.
ensuring that every child has a chance
to learn to read.
[applause]
>> [applause]
>> The Georgia Early Literacy Act of 2026
takes bold affirm affirmative steps
forward to strengthen Georgia's literacy
rates by by investing where it matters
most,
streamlining guidelines for grade
placement, fostering greater
collaboration at this district and
school level, better preparing Georgia's
future educators, and educating parents
on the critical importance of early
literacy and language development.
First,
we know that literacy coaches make a
difference, not only for students, but
for the teachers they support.
And let me be very clear here.
We are not in the state we're in because
of our teachers. They are doing an
incredible job. but they need additional
resources. I think we can all agree on
that. That's why we're adjusting the QBE
formula to include funding for a
literacy coach in every single K through
three elementary school across our great
state of Georgia.
[applause]
Next, we will streamline the guidelines
and procedure for great placement for
Georgia's earliest learners.
This really does not change the age
standards already set in place. It
simply establishes that kindergarten
will be the first step. Most of our
children are already attending
kindergarten, but some are not. And this
measure will ensure every child
experiences the building blocks of a
kindergarten program before the first
grade.
In addition, kindergarten and first
grade students are shown to be
significantly at risk for reading
difficulties by a variety of measures
including first and foremost parental
input will repeat the grade that grade
of learning.
This is not a step back. It's a step to
give students the best possible chance
for success.
Next, addressing this issue will be an
all hands-on deck effort.
School systems will be required to adopt
unified literacy plans, increasing
community and regional literacy
collaboration between teachers,
administrators, literacy coaches, and of
course, local leaders. The Georgia Early
Early Literacy Act will also engage
Georgia's, and this is very important,
engage Georgia's higher education
institutions that prepare the next
generation of educators to teach in
classrooms across Georgia.
The Professional Standards Commission
will help our educator preparation
programs get getting our graduating
teachers ready to step into the
classroom and teach reading from day one
and evaluate each instit institution's
education program every four years.
Finally,
we know that learning doesn't begin the
first time a student steps into the
classroom. It begins at birth.
That's why the House will propose
funding to ensure every single family in
Georgia receives a book upon the birth
of their child so they can begin reading
to their children from the very
beginning. And where it matters most,
they will begin that reading. That's at
home.
This funding will provide for a public
awareness campaign on the importance of
language development from pre-birth to
age five, ensuring our most precious
resource, our children are prepared to
be successful readers.
These measures are just the beginning
there. We know there will be more to
accomplish down the road,
but the time to do something is long
overdue.
Georgia's children are our future, and
they deserve every opportunity to dream
big, achieve success, and create a
brighter future for themselves.
I want to thank Chairman Irwin.
Thank you, Chairman D Chairman Dumnick,
every member of the House Education
Committee and Senator Billy Hickman for
their dedication to Georgia's next
generation of leaders.
And I also would be remiss if I didn't
do something else. I may be in trouble
for this, but I'm going to do it anyway.
We would not be here today without the
passion and commitment from my wife,
Dale.
>> [applause]
[applause]
>> Dale
has inspired each of us to pursue a
pathway to success for every child
across this state. Thank you, Dale. Love
you very much.
[applause]
>> [applause]
>> told you I was going to do it.
With that,
I'm going to turn it over to a dear
friend and a great leader in the
education sector who has worked
tirelessly,
traveled endless miles, and had
conversations
with endless number of educators and
professionals and parents
that matter most to this discussion. as
chairman Irwin.
After him will come my dear friend from
Statesboro Bulock County, Chairman Billy
Hickman. And then we'll call on Chairman
Matt Dubnick to close us out and we'll
take some questions at that point. Thank
you for your attention, Chairman Irwin.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. [applause]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And I'll tell
you, I'm very energized. has been uh
what I'll say years worth of work to get
to this point with a a lot of friends, a
lot of experts, um a lot of very
dedicated groups. I'm energized by the
fact that I'm looking around the room
and I see so many educators that change
lives every day. Let me thank y'all all
in this room for what you do and and how
you assist these [applause]
children.
By the way, educators, when I walked in
my office, the first song I heard was
Eye of the Tiger from Rocky. So, if that
tells you I was energized coming in the
building for this uh event today. Um and
again, we could not be here as Mr.
Speaker said uh without his wife, but we
could not be here without his leadership
and the things that he has done and the
direction he has pushed us. So, Mr.
Speaker, thank you for that leadership
and the guidance that you are providing
and the assistance you are giving us
here. So [applause]
let me begin by saying uh reading is
foundational to all learning.
Imagine for a moment if you were a
student in college and you could not
read. We happen to have a very famous
athlete that has a very good program
that had that exact problem. Imagine
that and how difficult it would be to be
in college if you could not read. We
absolutely have to tackle this effort.
This is the most meaningful and
impactful education legislation the
general assembly has championed since
the hope scholarship in 1992.
students across the state will benefit
from the policies included in what we're
calling the Georgia Early Literacy Act
of 2026.
And that will happen for generations to
come. And we will look forward to
working alongside all of our friends,
the the senators, in getting this
lifechanging
measure across the finish line.
Let me let me state that to get to this
point today has take taken a tremendous
team effort.
I want to start with the fact that we
passed a bill championed by
Representative Ballard a few years ago
HB538
and a big part of this team. I want to
recognize her for a minute and her
efforts in literacy. Thank you,
Representative Ballard,
[applause]
for that great kickoff to get us to this
point. I also want to champion a a a
good friend of mine and a collaboration
that is going to change lives, and
that's my relationship and Senator
Hickman's relationship and the working
of the House and the Senate together to
help and make generational change. So,
thank you, Senator [applause]
And then lastly, the speaker pointed out
his wife, Dale Burns. Let's don't forget
a lifelong educator that has easily seen
the passion for education and for
students in this state of Georgia and
her efforts and guidance and working us
to this point.
Thank you, Miss Dale Burns. Again, thank
you. [applause]
I will tell you that I feel very
comfortable when I have experts like
Dale Burns sitting in the room next to
me. And what the speaker talked about
with those coaches on literacy in the
classroom with the teachers right next
door. Those coaches are going to give
the same confidence that I get when Miss
Burns is working with me as those
teachers are going to get when the
coaches standing next to them inside the
classroom. So remember, we're going to
make some generational change here. Get
ready. Get on board with us. And I would
say that if you can't read, we're coming
to help. Thank you very much. [applause]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you,
speaker.
This is a great day. You know, this all
started
in roughly 2002, 2022, excuse me. You
know, we knew that our children could
not read, but we didn't know that our
children in my bullet county couldn't
read. We didn't know that my children in
our Evans County couldn't read. And when
we started to tell people in the
individual counties what the percentage
of third graders that were not able to
read, that's when people started
listening to us. And that's when the
train left the station. Thank goodness
that we have the vision, the House and
the Senate to care about our future and
care about the children in the
classroom. And obviously, as Mr.
Speaker, like you so eloquently said,
the teachers, it's not the teachers
fault by no means. We got teachers get
blamed, but it's it's just the system's
fault that we've let this happen to us.
So, I want to tell y'all in 2023, as you
well know, we passed two major literacy
bills. One literacy bill created the
Georgia Council on Literacy and other
literacy bill created the Georgia Early
Learning Act. Those two bills are what
spearheaded this whole movement that we
got going on today.
You, Mr. Speaker, you spoke about
Mississippi and you spoke about Alabama.
I am so happy that they had the vision
to do what was right before we did it. I
am so embarrassed now that the greatest
state in the nation, number one in
business for 12 straight years, have got
to look at other states as to how they
had literacy issues. But you know what?
We're doing it and we're happy to do it.
and we're happy that our team has been
to these states and reviewed it with
them.
What a pleasure it has been to work with
Chairman Irwin and the House team on
this on this companion bill that was
dropped in the House yesterday and
dropped in the Senate. We are team
effort on this thing. We're going to see
it through the line. I look so forward
to working with the House and Senate
education committees and as we further
review these and it's going to work
through the legislative process. But as
the speaker Elwood said and chairman
said, we going to do what's best for the
children and the students of Georgia.
Thank you. God bless y'all.
[applause]
The speaker used the word bold. Chairman
Irwin used the phrase generational
change. Chairman Hickman talked about
the vision. Those are the words that are
going to encompass what we're about to
do. This is a life-changing investment
that will occur in education. Again, the
likes of which we have not seen in
decades.
This is an absolutely necessary
investment that has to be made. If we
wait any longer, we will only fall
further behind.
>> I've heard from many of you, how much is
this going to cost? [laughter]
We're going to figure that out as the
process continues along. But here's the
question that that I always state.
You know, people talk about in business
this this idea of ROI.
And we all know what that stands for.
But I would challenge you to leave today
with a different view of ROI. And that
is the cost of the risk of ignoring.
>> Amen.
>> If we continue to ignore the problem in
front of us if we continue to ignore the
generational change that's at our
fingertips, we're only going to fall
further behind the likes of other
states. This is our home. This is our
responsibility. We will not shun that.
We will not step away from that. We will
meet it head on, but it's going to take
us all. It's going to take our partners
in the Senate. And I can't tell you
enough how much I'm thankful for
Chairman Irwin, Chairman Hickman, the
speaker, and Miss Dale for us partnering
together to bring us here today. Mr.
Speaker, love to take some questions.
>> Yes, sir.
>> We have a question or two.
>> You said it on [laughter]
Okay.
>> It's going to be the same pathway we had
yesterday, right? A couple days ago.
>> Uh Mr. Speaker, I think there is some
legislation so far to uh require uh
kindergarten enrollment for 5-year-olds
instead of the current six-year-olds. Is
that part of this plan or is it just
more recommended for
>> You want to address that?
>> Five.
>> Yeah.
>> In the in the legislation, we are not
changing the age in which in which a
child has to come to school. stays
September 1st if they turn six by
September 1st. Uh come to school, but we
are requiring children to go through the
kindergarten and kindergarten process to
go to first grade.
>> Thank you. Thank you, chairman.
>> Can you speak a little bit about some of
the results you've had from past
literacy projects and how the needs of
teachers and conversations you've had
have helped inform this legislation?
I don't know if I could hear the
question.
>> Speak up a little bit louder.
>> Closer to your mouth. Come on. Lift it.
>> Little bit louder.
>> A little louder. Okay.
>> You've had several efforts for um
literacy legislation over the past few
sessions. Can you talk a little bit
about how your conversations with
educators have helped you helped inform
what needs they might need addressed in
this legislation?
>> If I you want me to, Mr. Speaker? uh if
I understand your question right, it's
kind of how we got to this stage and who
we involved. We have not only been
studying for the last couple years what
other states around us are doing
successfully, but we also have visited
other states um most recently Alabama
right next door and what they have done
to increase their efforts. Of course,
we're calling in experts in the field.
We're discussing with experts about what
they are seeing that have been
successful in changes and that's how we
got to this point with our own groups
behind us is to build our capacity to
make this change
>> and we've invested literacy coaches in
recent course last year we also invested
in lit literacy coaches and every resa
in this state to help this process get
kick started. So this is a continuation
more investment.
>> Uh one question speaker too on the
literacy coaches in particular. I know
you know before session started you said
there was uh you're going to make
efforts to bring more residencies to
Georgia for medical students. Are you
going to do something similar for
teachers and specifically these literacy
coaches to make sure that these needs
are met uh with personnel? And could you
also talk about some of the requirements
that these coaches need to have in order
to get these jobs?
>> You take part of that. I have
>> I'm again having a hard time hearing him
from back there.
>> One more time.
>> One time.
>> What are we doing specifically for
liters coaching?
>> Is that better?
>> Yes.
>> Okay. Awesome. I was just curious about
how you're going to make sure that
you're able to fill the personnel needs
for this increase in literacy coaching
positions and also some of the
requirements that these folks will have
to have to get these jobs.
>> That that that's great. Read through the
bill is what I'd tell you. We got very
specific on the qualifications for these
coaches that come in, what kind of
experience they have to have to be a
literacy coach. So we we're very aware
of what it takes to make this successful
in a classroom and help a teacher. We're
requiring those coaches to have that and
then transfer that knowledge they have
to the teacher and and to work with the
child. So that that that part is very
specific. I will tell you the number of
coaches is going to be vast and we're
going to have to phase that in in time.
But as Chairman Dubnik said, we're
trying to move as quickly as we possibly
can with what we have currently so that
we can get it all the way into the
classroom as quickly as possible. These
are not positions we're talking about in
coaches that are sitting at a central
office somewhere. These are in the
classroom side by side to the teacher.
We're calling them coaches. That's
exactly what they are.
And I mentioned in remarks all hands on
deck
with without higher eds cooperation it
can't happen. So we've had conversations
with the chancellor with presidents
everyone I talk to when I speak to them
presidents of of universities around
this state and the deans of the colleges
of education understand there's an issue
and they're ready to step up and prepare
their graduates to go to work and fill
these positions. So, I think we're going
to be in a good place. Everyone
understands it's another investment.
>> Thank you. So, um I know you can't give
us a budget figure yet. Can you hear me?
>> Yeah.
>> Um but I'm wondering, you said this is
going to be in QBE, so it'll be funded
every year. Part of the formula. Will
local school districts will they have to
come up with any money to fund these
positions?
>> I'll let you answer that. I'll go I'll
put my superintendent hat back on that
the QBE aotment sheet is given to the
the systems. They know that they'll see
an item with this on it. Uh but you all
know that there are expenses when you
hire employees that the system pays. I'm
going to give you an example. Retirement
the system the employer has a retirement
contribution to every single um employee
they have. So yes, there will be uh cost
but it is a smaller
part of the pie than salary is and
that's what QB is going to be picking up
for you.
>> Thank you.
>> Is it only QB or will there be lottery
funding related to this?
>> You want to do that?
>> Yeah.
>> Come on, man. Billy, if you want to
chime in. Billy, do you have something
you want to say? Okay.
>> One of One of the things that we've
talked about is finding a way to make
this investment that again that we can't
ignore. And while we're certainly not
opposed to looking at lottery funds
right now, we're looking at this as
being a part of our state funding as
Chairman Irwin just said, as part of our
QBE formula. And so this will be there
in the budget, baked into the budget,
something that the state is investing
in. But it would be my sincere hope that
everyone involved, state and local,
understands that this is an investment
again that we cannot ignore.
