Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, on behalf of the Columbus delegation, I'm so pleased this morning to introduce our chaplain. Our chaplain for today is Chaplain Major Angel Elberius. And he is an ordained minister with the assemblies of God. He was ordained in 1989. Chaplain Beras is a 1986 graduate of Central Bible College in Springfield, Missouri, with the Bachelor of Arts in Biblical Theology. He later received a Master's of Arts in Religion at Liberty Theological Seminary. And also a Master's of Divinity also at Liberty. Upon graduating from the CBC, Chaplain Beras became a youth pastor at Bethel, a Simley of God in Savage, Maryland. And from 1987 to 2009, he was a full-time missionary evangelist, ministering in 45 countries at 49 states. He is fluent in Spanish and this morning he gave Ambassador Smaria Spanish lesson. In 2009, Chaplain Beras joined the United States Army and was stationed at Fort Hood, Texas, where he was assigned to the third squadron of the third armored cavalry regiment as a swadron chaplain. And from August 2010 to August 2011, he was deployed to Iraq to an operation new dawn with the third ACR and earned a bronze star. In June of 2012, he was stationed at Fort Mead, Maryland and was assigned as battalion chaplain to the 308th battalion of the 900 and second military intelligence group. In August of 2015, Chaplain Beras was assigned an operational deployment to the Joint Task Force Bravo in Sovo, Kano Airport Space in Honduras, where he was the battalion chaplain for the 1-228th Aviation Battalion. And upon completion of that assignment, Chaplain Beras was assigned to the 83rd Chemical Battalion at Fort Stewart, Georgia as the battalion chaplain. In April of 2010, Chaplain Beras was promoted to major and he came to the command and general staff college at Fort Belvar, Virginia for four months. And then in 2019, he was the Bergeri chaplain for the 3rd Infantry Division of the Division Artillery at Fort Stewart, Georgia. And presently, he is the Bergeri chaplain for the 194th armored Bergeri at Fort Benning, Georgia. He is married to the former common avarés and they have three children, Dacia, Michael and Danielle. It's my honor to present Chaplain Angel Beras to join us for this morning. Good morning. Mr. Speaker, thank you for this opportunity and for presenting the hug. Thank you, thank you also for this opportunity. I appreciate Georgia. I am originally from Maryland. I graduated from Mead Senior High School in Fort Mead, Maryland. My wife is in Northern Virginia. But as you know, when it comes to the military, the military sends us all kinds of places. As mentioned in my bio, I spent three years in Goodall Fort Stewart, Savannah area and presently now I am in Goodall Fort Benning in a Columbus area. My wife and I we enjoy Georgia here for the last five, six years that we lived in your state. You know, I'm a history buff. I love history. And I know that Georgia is one of the original 13 colonies. Amen? Okay. And by the way, as a chaplain, I can talk spiritual things and I can have you say amen. Is that correct? All right. Very good. Georgia is one of the original 13 colonies. And one of my favorite classes that I took in seminary was American Christianity. And I learned in that class that every country has a spiritual rhythm. Every country has a spiritual rhythm. For example, middle eastern countries are their spiritual, spiritual rhythm would be like Islam. India would be like Hinduism. South America where I traveled extensively would be Roman Catholicism. When it comes to our country, United States of America, what would be our spiritual rhythm? Obviously, it would be Christianity. Okay? And so with the spiritual rhythm comes a way in which people live and are values. I personally believe that our country is the greatest country in the world. I personally believe that our country has been blessed by God. Amen? So our spiritual heritage being that it is from biblical principles and from Christianity, understand that our values come from the Word of God. And whatever our spiritual heritage is, whatever the spiritual heritage is of a country, it reflects on the way people live, the way people think, the way people act. Reflect our history. So I want to encourage everybody here to understand that America is a great country because of our spiritual rhythm, because of the commitment that our founding fathers and that throughout history that we have given emphasis to biblical principles to the Word of God, to Christianity. I submit this to you. We are a great nation. The freedom that we've enjoyed throughout the years, the freedom that we enjoy today, believe it or not, folks, has a lot to do with the spiritual rhythm of this country. One great philosopher said, if you can cause a people to forget their heritage, you can persuade them to believe in anything. God help us. If we forget our heritage, we will forget who we are. Amen. Let me encourage and challenge everybody here to understand that we serve an awesome God. Amen. Let us pray. Our God in heaven. Thank you for honoring us with your presence at this time here in the House Chamber. Show us that without your guidance and blessings, we will not be able to make good and right decisions for the people of the state of Georgia. Our efforts would be futile and worthless. For your word says that through you, all things were made and without you, nothing was made that has been made. Therefore, you have all things in control. So indeed, we are convinced that you govern any affairs of men. Precious Holy Spirit. Make yourself real to us by revealing truth about every issue that will be discussed on the floor today. Truth is powerful. Truth is necessary. And truth will bring true liberty of which our state has so long experienced. I rebuke the deceits of darkness that would attempt to derail us from true truth, which is your holy word. I ask these things in confidence, believing that you hear us honor or faith, I ask, in your holy name, I pray. Amen. The pleasure of allegiance. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Thank you, sir. Doorkeepers, please unlock the doors. And at the end of photographs up here, the chaplain will greet members in the anti-room, not on the floor. The chair recognizes Chairman Hogan, the chair of the Committee on Information and Audits. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Your Committee on Information and Audits has read the journal of the previous legislative day and found it to be correct. And furthermore, Mr. Speaker, never argue with stupid people because they will drag you down to their level and then beat you with experience. Mark Twain.

This was a sad and painful weekend in our Fannie and County community. Friday night, Corporal Richard Gazzleway, a deputy with a Fannie and County Sheriff's office in his wife Heather, tragically died in a car crash in Jackson County. They were enroute to a youth ag event in which their 12-year-old daughter was to have participated. Corporal Gazzleway and Heather were as solid and good as they get. Deputy Gazzleway had just been promoted back on January 1 to the rank of Corporal. Everyone whose life was touched by him describe a dependable energetic and willing public servant who was so proud to wear that badge. And he was thrilled with his promotion. If a job needed to be done, he would seek it out. In 2021, he put in over 600 hours of overtime with the department. Besides his duties in the Sheriff's office, he was a compliance officer in the accountability court where he was known as being patient and caring. A deputy in the department told me this weekend that he was one of those special people that you don't know how good they are until they're gone. Sheriff Dane Kirby said when I chatted with him over the weekend that losing deputy Gazzleway was like losing two deputies because of the extra responsibility that he not only took on but cheated. Richard and Heather's daughters, 12 and 3 were with them in the wreck and they're recovering from their injuries. I would ask you this morning to join with me in a moment of silence to honor Richard and Heather Gazzleway. And I would also ask that you keep their daughters, their families and friends in your prayers. Thank you Madam Speaker. The chair recognizes Representative Vanuloet's from morning order. Good morning. Raise your hand if you were ever a girl scout. Raise your hand if you have ever raised a girl scout. That's right. Today is Girl Scout Day at the Capitol when you go outside in the hallways in the rotunda. There are Girl Scouts in abundance. If you would like to sign on to a resolution that Representative Butler has honoring the Girl Scouts, come find me. If at any point during the session you feel compelled to eat your feelings, we're all in there. You might need some Girl Scout cookies. If you need some Girl Scout cookies you can come see me too. These Girl Scouts are bright, dazzling, brilliant. They are so motivated to learn about our state, to learn about what we do here in this Capitol. And to be amazing citizens. And so again if you see a Girl Scout out there give her a high five because we're delighted to have them here today. Thank you. Oh yes. There is a picture at 11. Chair recognizes Representative's gullet, gravely mump to ham Collins and Hitchens from morning order. Thank you Madam Chair. Friends in this chamber today is a very very special day because for 49 years in the state of Georgia we have recognized February 1st as Firefighter Recognition Day here in the Capitol. So today is the 50th annual Firefighter Recognition Day. Every one of us have constituents that are firefighters. Every one of us has a community that is served by firefighters. And every one of us has a stake in their well-being, their support and their ability to protect and serve our communities. Ladies and gentlemen I want to let you know that in Georgia there's over 30,000 firefighters in our state that work in over 900 fire departments in this state. We have firefighters that are a part of this body. Representative Lormick Donald served his community as a firefighter. And there are others in this community. Ladies and gentlemen today down at the depot normally we do it right here in the return to the Capitol on the South Steps. But today at 5 p.m. we will recognize with our annual firefighter award ceremony down at the depot at 5 p.m. in a dinner at 6 p.m. I hope you all will come and support it and I give a shout out to my family members. Captain Truman Oating with the Atlanta Fire Department firefighter Todd Butler with the fire, Atlanta Fire Department firefighter Roger Legger, firefighter with a polling county volunteer, Captain Chris Chastain, the Hinton Fire Department Volunteer, firefighter Jake Wardlaw, Smurna Fire Department and firefighter Cory Hopkins, Cobb County Fire Department. These are my family members. I'm very, very proud of them in their service because they save lives for a living. Thank you Madam Chair. Chair recognizes representatives Jasper's Corbett and Watson for a morning order. Thank you Speaker Pro Tem. We want to thank Speaker Ralston for his vision is starting the real development council. Over five years ago his vision has helped rural Georgia. He wisely appointed two giants of the legislature, Chairman England, so over there, and Chairman Jay Powell to lead us. They did a great job. I had to say the current leadership, Chairman Watson, co-chairman Cobra, Corbett, excuse me, we know each other well in myself. That's why you know we're, you've worked hard to attempt to live up to their standard of excellence and impact. And we always really appreciate Chairman England always being with us and giving his wisdom as we always meet. This year we have 11 bills and seven different committees with eight more coming. You know these legislative priorities will continue as Speaker Ralston said, you know to not to make a difference what your zip code is and your success in Georgia. You know we asked all the bill sponsors and members to be up here with us because we required them needed their expertise to work on these bills. Mr Speaker we thank you for your leadership and I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Deedra Powell who led us this year and Blake Doss. He just works on these bills you've seen him everywhere and we really appreciate their work. Thank you Mr Speaker. Chair recognizes representatives Dubnik and Wade from Morning Order. Thank you Madam Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House on January 23rd our colleague representative Chris Irwin was recognized by the Georgia Association of Educational Leaders also known as Gail. They gave to him one of their highest honors the Alleen McGill Award for Distinguished Public Service. This is an annual award given to a public servant who has demonstrated and my favorite word here who has demonstrated a repeated pattern of lifetime service to the best interest of children and educators in Georgia's public school system. This award was named for a Georgia former Georgia school superintendent after her untimely passing in 2018 and so that all of you know representative Irwin was honored during his time as a school superintendent in 2013 as Georgia Superintendent of the year. He's a veteran supporter and member of Gail and their organization and has tirelessly given more than 30 years to public service as an educator. Please join me in congratulating our colleague representative Irwin for this lifetime of service and this award to Georgia's children.

Thank you Madam Speaker. Chair recognizes Representative McClain from Morning Order. Thank you Madam Speaker. I just want to let you all know the calendars on your desk were provided by Life Link of Georgia. Just realize if you go through here you'll see the faces of transplant and I want you to know the family. So in April what you'll have is that is organ donation awareness month. So I want to make sure that I brought a doctor with me to realize that it is very important to share this with you and give you an idea to see the faces, the lawyers, the doctors, the people that take care of us. So thank you. Thank you Madam Speaker. Chair recognizes Representative Wolensky from Morning Order. Thank you. Today we recognize the third annual Jewish Genetic Screening Awareness Week. This week serves to emphasize the importance of prioritizing our own health and our families' health. Being aware of our hereditary health risk can be a powerful tool in the prevention of devastating genetic conditions and cancer. We have a responsibility to be proactive about our well-being and it's now easier than ever. Organizations such as J. Screen are instrumental in making medical grade testing a genetic counseling affordable and accessible. The number of people who have already avoided a cancer diagnosis or caught it at an early treatable stage demonstrates the need to shine a spotlight on genetic screening for cancer success stability. For those who are planning a family genetic screening gives vital information that could affect the health of future children, knowledge is power and the more we know the more lives can be saved. I'm proud to be a part of creating healthy families for generations to come. This week we urge you to take control of your health, take action and get screened. Thank you. Chair recognizes Representative Bird from Morning Order. Thank you Madam Chair. This is an American of Chinese heritage. Happy Chinese New Year. 2020 is designated as the year of the tiger. In Chinese culture the tiger is a symbol of bravery, wisdom and strength. Different places and people have different cultures. We should take time to understand, respect and appreciate each other's history, culture and tradition. Guam Si Fatai wishing you prosperity for the year of the tiger. Thank you. Chair recognizes Representative Clark from Morning Order. Good morning colleagues. Today is the first day of Black History Month. For today's Black History Fact, I would like to highlight one of our darker moments in our nation's history, Lest We Forget. After the Civil War ended in 1865, the Grant Administration implemented reconstruction where northern troops were placed throughout the South to protect the rights of the formerly enslaved people. Then in the election of 1876, Samuel Tilden won the popular vote, but several southern states sent multiple sets of electors in an effort to refute which candidate won their state. Sound familiar? A compromise was made. The Republican Rutherford B. Hayes would be declared president in exchange for the end of reconstruction. Once this happened, we saw the rise of the dehumanization of Black people through Jim Crow laws, segregation, lynching and the rise of the prison industrial complex. The parallels to today are stark and alarming. So I'll end with this. Those who do not know their history are destined to repeat it. Thank you, Madam Speaker. Chair recognizes Representative Evans for Morning Order. Thank you, Madam Protem. Colleagues, I rise this morning to honor the life of my father, William R. Farmer. On your desks, I've placed an article about his life and a poem he wrote and a letter from the president who wrote him back, Gerald Ford, at the time. My father, William R. Farmer, was a son of a railroad man, a first in his family to go to college, naval, a submarine officer, a pastor, New Testament scholar, civil rights and social justice activist, a participant in civil disobedience, an ally of those that are marginalized. A wonderful father, husband, grandfather. That was a bit of a renegade. He was a New Testament scholar and he believed in his research that Matthew was the first gospel and that's not what the prevailing wisdom was. He had excellent scholarship for that. He wrote over 20 books. He also was a Methodist minister and he taught at SMU. After working there for 30 years, he loved his work, loved his, with such passion that he went to work at University for Dallas, a Catholic University for 10 years. His last piece of work was a commentary on the Bible that was, most of the authors were from developing countries. He believed in the voices of the marginalized speaks such truth to the Christian experience. So I have on your desk a poem. He wrote, he wasn't up there. Well, this is the only poem he wrote that I know of, but it's entitled, What is America? He wrote it right after Watergate. I was 12 years old and he has a deep belief in our country as I do. America is the world coming together, but it's also acknowledges some of the sins of our origins and then speaks of how we can move beyond that, but there is suffering and pain coming through that. So I believe that this poem speaks to me now. It spoke to me when I ran for office. It speaks to me even more now and oh, thank you. I'm sorry, Sir Lord, please. I hope you'll read it and please help me have an honor, my father, with a moment of silence. Thank you. Thank you. Chair recognizes representative Henderson from Morning Order. Thank you, Madam Speaker and good morning to the House of Representatives. My name is Pastor Sharon Henderson and I stand before you this morning with a heavy heart. Newton County is deeply satan by the loss of Mr. T. K. Adams. As you can see on your screen on either side, Mr. and Mrs. T. K. Adams is lovely wife Louise Adams during a 55 year marriage he departed this life. Mr. Adams added a ton of wealth to our community. He was a resident of Newton County for over five decades, band director for over 36 years, 14 times teacher of the year and yes 14 times teacher of the year. A starlight in our community and abroad. Most of all he was a man of God with a heavy heart of love for God's people. Mr. Adams was a pit of me of love. Mr. Corinthian 13 and 14 was a scripture he lived by. Love is patient, love is kind. It's not puffed up because God is love. It's not what you say to people but how you say it. You respect me and I'll respect you he says. Mr. Adams we love you but God loves you best. He's going to be truly miss but forever remembered. He had a heart of goal and we'll miss him forever and ever. His famous saying out well end with that. His favorite quote was I was born with nothing. I inherited a little but I left a lot. That's how I'd like to be remembered. Would you please join me in a moment of silence. Thank you. Thank you Madam Speaker, are you back? Okay we got just a few seconds more than three minutes left. Chair recognizes representative Leverept for a morning order. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House Representative Cameron and I are separated by a lot of miles of geography but we're united today in our sorrow at the passing of Gary Scott Jones. Gary was a child of both Rossville where he was born in Elberton where he lived the last 30 years. He passed away last year and his passing and timely passing has left a crippling blow to our communities. He was a journalist. He was an old school journalist. He checked and rechecked and verified all the details of his story. He was editor and publisher of the Elberton Star for many years. Although we didn't always agree politically I respected as did everyone who read his copy respected his work. He was a man who loved God. He was a faithful member at Elberton first United Methodist Church and he loved his family but close third to that he loved the Atlanta Braves. A cardiac event took his life on November 1 but he survived a similar event several days earlier. He was unconscious for about a day and when he came to on Saturday evening the first question he asked was if the Braves had won game 3. He leaves behind a beloved wife Anna his parents Anne and Claude children Ashley and Christopher and grandchildren beloved grandchildren Jones and Jackson. His passing leaves a void in our community and in the hearts of all who knew him. Please join me for a brief moment of silence in honor of Gary Jones. Thank you Mr. Speaker I yield well. Representative Sebal you've got a minute and 15 seconds. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Colleagues arise today to commend City of Married at Police Chief Dan Flynn on his retirement from law enforcement for 48 years. Chief Flynn has served as Chief of Police in the Married at Police Department in Married at Georgia since 2007. To his appointment with the Married at Police Department he served as Chief of the Savannah Police Department in Savannah Georgia and as Chief of the Savannah Chatham Police Department before that. Prior to that he served as a major assigned to the Special Patrol Bureau as a commander with Miami Day Police Department in Florida. Chief Flynn is a graduate of St. Thomas University and holds a Master's degree in public administration as well as several other leadership certificates. He's also a graduate of the FBI National Academy. He is a pioneer in addressing criminal patterns using statistical analysis and was one of the first to introduce the philosophy of community policing in the late 1980s before the concept was well known and used openly in policing today. His focus on the case he's of way an retirement department worked together to advance public safety led to the creation of numerous programs that both sought to reduce crime. Chief Flynn is a blood leader that has left an everlasting legacy of service beyond self and our world is a better and safer place today because of Chief Dan Flynn. Colleagues will you please rise and join me in thanking and congratulate Chief Dan Flynn and his white Denise on a distinguished 48 year career in law enforcement. I yield the web. We have run out of time for morning orders. If you signed up for one and we're not recognized then see the messenger if you want to sign back up for tomorrow. We're now going on to the rules calendar. We're going on to the rules calendar. The clerk will read the caption to House Bill 385. Bill 385, I'm a black man on 146 and others to be titled back to men. Article 7 and chapter 3, title 47, Fishbow to George Antider relating retirement allowances, disability benefits and spouses benefits. His bill have been assigned to the committee on retirement. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee. Chairman Blackman to present the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker, fellow members. Bring before you House Bill 385 and this would allow our public school teachers to take retirement and after a 12 month waiting period return to the classroom full time in an area of high need. The actuarial study has come back with zero impact to TRS and if you've seen this, looks like you've seen this before it passed unanimously a couple of years ago. It also speaks to workforce, especially in our rural areas. So I would also mention and be remiss if I didn't thank all the hard work that's gone into this. I want to thank Speaker Pro Tim Jones, Wib Wilkerson, Chairman Belton, Chairman Benton, Representative Evans, Representative Erwin and so many more, some of which I don't even see here. But I want to thank them for their hard work over the years and of course the governor's team as well. Mr. Speaker, I'd be happy to answer questions if there are any. Looks like you've got two or three questions if you'd get an answer any. Yes, sir, be happy to. Chair recognizes Chairman Carson to your left for a question. Mr. Gentlemen, you, I do. Thank you, Chairman, for bringing this bill. I just wanted to reiterate what you mentioned in the well. Is it not true that the State Auditor gave a certification letter on this measure and said that this bill as proposed, actually the substitute as well, does not have a financial impact against TRS, isn't that correct? You would know well, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Yes, sir. Thank you very much. Do you further you? I will, sir. Chair recognizes Representative Jasmine Clark to your left for a question. Does it gentlemen you? Yes, ma'am. You stated in your presentation that this bill has passed before. If it passed before, why is it for us today? It passed the House. I apologize a couple of years ago unanimously and it was late in session so we did not get across the other body. Thank you. Thank you. You have one more question if you care to take you. Sure. Now I'll take another question. Chair recognizes Representative Dunahue to your left for a question. Does it gentlemen you? It's a friendly one. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. And I appreciate always your transparency with someone asked a question. Now remember this bill from two years ago and with this, I want to clarify that these people have retired. They've waited year. They come back and they teach in the K through 12. Is that correct? And it's not coaches or librarians or counselors. These are teachers because we have a teacher shortage that are coming back to teach but feel that shortage is that correct? I think you put it well, yes, sir. It's a classroom requirement. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, I will ask this body for their favorable consideration and yield the well, sir. Gentlemen, is yielded the well? Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted.

Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 385. The eyes are 169. The nays are zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 624. House Bill 624 by Roger Taylor, 173rd and others being entitled to amend Code Section 1562. The fiscal to Georgia and Tate River, the number of judges and spirit courts. So as a revive for a judicial judge, the superior court of the South Georgia judicial circuit, the bill I'm referring to the committee on judiciary, the committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Darlene Taylor to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, today I bring you House Bill 624. This is a bill that relates to the South Georgia judicial district. It consists of five rural counties and the currently we have two superior court judges. We are currently ranked number one in need of the new judgeship by the Judiciary Workload Assessment Committee and the Judicial Council. According to the last workload assessment, each judge of our circuit does the comparable work of 1.8 superior court judges. The last time the new superior court judgeship was added to our circuit was in 1978. In other words, our beloved dogs have won two national championships since our circuit got a new judge. I would really appreciate your favorable consideration of this very needed judgeship. You have no questions? Thank you. I would appreciate your favorable consideration. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute?

The eyes are 169. The nasors zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Chair recognizes Chairman Matt Dollar on a point of personal privilege. Chairman Dollar. Thank you, Speaker. I want two things in this speech. One, to hold it together, long enough to get through it. And two, for you to simply think that this is the best speech you've ever heard from this well. I'm not through yet. I'm not enough to chuckle heads. I agree. I don't think either it's likely to happen. Colleagues, today is my last day as a member of this House. Several of you have asked me if I was leading early and I've had to lie to many of my friends in here and Stephen Saints. Some time ago I accepted a role with TCSG, the technical college system of Georgia, working on economic development around our state. I'm very excited about this new chapter in my life, but it means I must step away from this role. I actually stayed longer than I planned, but I felt I needed to honor some commitments I made to people back home. Likewise, I want to thank Commissioner Dozier for understanding and being so flexible as this really has been flowed since we came back or since we came in a session. This is the first of what will be several retirement speeches this year. Calvin will get the most applause. Many of you will laugh at how drunk Don Hogan will probably be. But the important thing is this. We all must leave her someday. The lucky ones get to leave when they choose not when they're told. I've known this day was coming for a while now, but I did not put a pen to paper to write any thoughts down until yesterday, which is a very stupid idea because the emotions are still very raw, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. I've also kept it quiet or tried to. Seems everybody already kind of knew. Because I wanted to conduct my business here and not be treated like I was dying or something. After all, I will still live 20 miles from the capital and many, many here are lifelong friends. I will still be around. Ron Stevens. Don't be surprised if you see me at Savannah night on Thursday. We'll see. I also wanted to keep this quiet because I wanted to support my colleagues, John Carson and Sharon Cooper, who will be representing what is now an expiring district. The longer I stayed, the less likely they would have a possible incumbent running against them. There are several scenarios. Well, my understanding the governor has 10 days to call an election to fill my seat and 30 to 60 days from the call to hold an election. There are several scenarios where a person is not even elected until after we've finally died. I will be supporting both of my friends in the next election. I first came to the capital as a college intern in 2000. I just turned 21 years old. It was my first session and I've been here every session since. Elected in 2002, I spent nearly my entire adult life here. The night I was first elected, my uncle called and in the blur of phone calls that night, you all know what I'm talking about. He paused and he said, take your work very seriously. We don't take yourself too seriously. Those are words I think my 24-year-old self needed to hear and soon after I set myself to doing just that. Most of what I would call my greatest and closest friends, I'm that right here. Many have left. Other new friends have arrived. I won't name names, they're too many to list. Since day one of walking in here, some of my closest friends have been Democrats. I've never apologized for that. Some of you are sitting here now. Again, I don't want to name names. Those places always I felt better than DC in that regard and I hope it reverts back to more of those past times. Some observations and things I've learned here. We all, all of us ran for office because of our people back home. It's the people here that keep us wanting to come back. Our friends inside this chamber now, I'll leave it over in the Senate and other levels of this building. In 20 years, I have taken the well to speak to a bill that wasn't my own only once.

That's taken a lot of self control. Sometimes you want to jump on the desk and hurdle things. Everybody in here knows what I'm talking about. But here, as many things in life, less is often more. Often those things that make us see the mad and just see red, don't seem to bother us down the line a few months later. Actually, a good example of that is just last week. Don Parsons, my seat maid of 18 years and office neighbor, next door neighbor for more than 10, and I guess district neighbors for almost 20 years, I thought I might go to jail for having to throttle him, for getting in the well, as speaking gets my bill. And as I stand her today, I can't say I'm mad. And I like him and I wanted that. But I just hope at the end of the day we're all friends. This place has taught me that those that show the most respect are the most respected, as a young person, this place, and the campaign process, and dealt me with the degree of confidence and humility. I'm not certain person could have obtained any other place. I'll do better. I want to thank some people. I want to thank all the staff, the administrative assistants, the budget staff, the clerk's office, my good friend, the clerk, House of Media Office, Capital Security, Sanitation Crew, Legislative Council, the army of people. Many we see, many we don't, and make what we do possible. In particular, I want to give a shout out to Pam Lewis up in rules office, my former admin and my capital mama. Actually, well, I didn't bring it up here, I was sitting over there, that was given to me my freshman year in 2003, and it's been in my office every day since. I've loved it, I've cared for it, and I've neglected it, and I want to give it to Ms. Pam. She helped people to live, probably more than I did all those years. And I'm, oh, Pam, don't worry about coming to get it. I'll send it up with Richard. People out in the hall, I want to thank the people out in the hall. I don't expect all of them will be returning my calls after today. But some of them will. Oh, the years has been, far less turnover out there than in here, and many of you are true friends, you know who you are. I want to thank the governor, I have the highest admiration for, and I think even the Democrats in here can agree, I could agree, Captain Dust, through some of the most uncertain waters, most of us have ever seen, and we came out the other side and I think it will be calm waters, with the wind and the tide at our back. I want to thank him for his friendship and his leadership. I have served under four speakers. I feel very fortunate to call my three former speakers friends to this day. And speaker, we're all still after today, you will be another of my former speakers. And I feel very fortunate to call you friend. All of us in this room know, hmm, all of us in this room know pressure, and responsibility. But none of us know the pressure and responsibility of being speaker. What I do know, having observed this place since the days of Tom Murphy, then it is a role that takes more than it gives. David Oralston, I am amazed at how easy you make it look. I'll pull it together. I want to thank my parents. You don't get to choose your parents, but I couldn't advance for two better ones. I'm very lucky. I want to thank my partner, Sarah, for creating a marry me. I think all of y'all for keeping tabs on that development. I'm going to borrow something. I want to borrow something I got from Fred Rogers. Mr. Rogers, as he's better now. Hmm. I'm going to borrow something I got from Fred Rogers. Mr. Rogers, as he's better now. Hmm. Along with my family, so many people have helped me to get here. They're not just here, but here in life. Summer here. Summer far away. Summer in heaven. Would you take just, sorry, all of us have special ones who've loved us and shaped us. Would you take just 10 seconds, along with me, in here and out in the hull, or wherever you might be watching this, take 10 seconds to think the people who helped you to become the person you are. Those that have cared about you and wanted what was best for you in life, just 10 seconds of silence. I'll keep the time. Whoever you've been thinking about, how pleased they must know, the difference you feel they've made in your life. Thank you, House, for being such an important part of my life. Thank you. Thank you. Chairman Duller and I came to this house at the same time, and I remember thinking when I met him, who hired this guy as their intern? We're going to miss you very, very much.

Chair recognizes, chairman tanker, sleep for an announcement. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is an important announcement to all of you who have redistricting bills. There is a deadline of February the 7th to have it dropped here in the house. And because these bills will affect the 2022 election cycle. So they have to be passed out of the house by February the 10th. So your deadline to drop them to 7th. The deadline was developed to ensure that we'd have the maximum amount of time for the governor to sign the bills and for the local election officials to make necessary changes. So I know they had a number of first readings on our house bills this morning over in the Senate. I think they'll do more over the next couple of days. You have a senator.
